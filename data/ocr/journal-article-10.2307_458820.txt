<plain_text><page sequence="1">XIX MATTHEW ARNOLD AND SCIENCE HE central axiom of Mathew Arnold'sa cultural arithmetic is well known; less familiar is this curiously precise elaboration: And, as the discipline of conduct is three-fourths of life, for our aesthetic and in- tellectual disciplines, real as these are, there is but one-fourth of life left; and if we let art and science divide this one-fourth fairly between them, they will have just one-eighth of life each.' The aim of this paper is to evaluate Arnold's endeavor to integrate firmly with other interests the fraction assigned to science. I. Throughout his life he repeatedly faced the problem of such an inte- gration; the more despairing lines in "Dover Beach" and "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse" and the conservative classical humanism of "Literature and Science"2 and "A Speech at Eton" do not exhaust his a Works of Arnold frequently cited, and the editions used, are designated by the following abbreviations: CUS Civilization in the United States (Boston, 1888).

In education his hostility to the intrusion of natural science was by no means unmitigated. In religion he sought, and believed he had found, an experimentally verifiable position. In spite of a certain distrust of or distaste for science and a fairly comprehensive ignorance of its details, he believed he was following in important ways the lead of the scientific spirit. Repeatedly, if somewhat sporadically and incon- clusively, he undertook to adjust the modern English mind to that spirit as well as to defend "established amenities"3 against its encroachments. Both the adjustment and the defense are complicated by Arnold's use of the word science in two different senses, sometimes consciously dis- tinguished and sometimes unconsciously confused. Always approving is his use of it in the older and broader sense of thorough, systematic knowl- edge in any field4-his father's use.5 Matthew Arnold constantly em- ployed it, or its equivalent Wissenschaft,6 to designate the opposite of irrational prejudice, which he regarded as one of the great failings of his countrymen.7 In this sense he associated the word science with his favor- ite formula, "to see the thing as in itself it really is,"8 implying9 that it meant disinterestedness; a whole, sane view of things; the open mind; radicalism of "Literature and Science." But Mr. Trilling is speaking of the social radicalism involved in developing a less aristocratic view of literature, whereas we are here concerned with the cultural conservatism involved in conceiving the excellence of literature largely in terms of Greek.

The argument is that Arnold sought to mediate between science and the "amenities"; that his effort was always first "to see the thing as it really was," next to formulate "a constructive hypothesis of underlying causes" (p. 54), and then to suggest measures rationally adjusted to the facts; and that in so doing he was applying scientific method to the non-scientific ends of cultural advance. 4 "... a German scientific book of any sort,-on philosophy, history, art, religion, etc...."

In the other and for Arnold less uniformly approving sense, the word had more nearly the twentieth- century significance: "Science has now made visible to everybody the great and pregnant elements of difference which lie in race."'0-"[Science is] the comprehension and interpretation of the [physical] world."1 Usually this narrower sensel2 was indicated by the plural,13 or by a limiting adjective ("physical science" or "natural science"), or, with special ref- erence to elementary teaching in schools, by the term Natur-kunde; usually the broader sense was clearly broad. But there was confusion between them, too; and even when distinguished they indicated not two different conceptions but two aspects of the same "one-eighth of life." In either aspect, science left us "still in the sphere of intellect and knowl- edge"; in either aspect it had to be related "to the sense in us for conduct, and to the sense in us for beauty."14 Yet the two senses were for Arnold of quite different importance. If "one-eighth of life" included both aspects of science, and so might be split once again, it is clear which sixteenth appealed to him more. His knowledge of the external world was not scientific: "My own studies have been almost wholly in letters, and my visits to the field of the natural sciences have been very slight and inadequate, although those sciences have always strongly moved my curiosity."15 The strength of that curi- osity may be questioned. A glance through his Letters or Notebooks16 will make clear that except for a certain interest in botanical handbooksl7 he o1 CA, p. 124. Such differences are of course less emphasized by more recent ethnological theory; the point here made is simply that Arnold was using the word science in a restricted sense. Cf. SPP, p. 37; cf. HSG, pp. xxxviii-xxxix. n CL, p. 84. 12 Though the last quotation might seem broad enough, the context justifies the insertion of the word physical. The theory of derivation is illuminating: "Out of the steady humdrum habit of the creeping Saxon ... has come ...

This steady-going habit leads at last ... up to science, up to the comprehension and interpreta- tion of the world."

Botanical references are fairly frequent in his family letters from about 1866 to 1870 (I, 387; II, 44, 72-73, 109, 113, 117, 145, 200, 402), and numerous in his poetry; his friend Sir Mountstuart Grant Duff (Letters, II, 187-188, 396-397) praised their accuracy in an article which was little more than a series of quotations: "The Plant Allusions in the Poems of Matthew Arnold," Nature Notes, I (1890), 81-84, 104-107. In Arnold's prose written for publication, however, I have noted no such reference.

His "poor little science"' did indeed enable him to use a geological terml9 or an astronomical proposi- tion20 in a personal letter; to mention the chemical composition of ether21 or the products of combustion in a candle flame;22 to disparage Bishop Butler's psychology, with analogies from alchemy and physiology.23 But such allusions were infrequent and rather casual. He seemed not sure he would find time to read his presentation copy of Lubbock's Pre-Historic Man,24 and lamented that if he lived to be eighty he would "probably be the only person left in England who reads anything but newspapers and scientific publications."25 As mere information, natural knowledge in- terested Arnold very little; now and then he revealed even a sort of con- tempt for the details of scientific fact.26 Among the British scientists of his day, he was probably at least ac- quainted with Darwin,27 and was on fairly intimate terms with Huxley,28 Tyndall, and Sir John Lubbock. Twice he was Huxley's guest at the annual dinners of the Geological Society,29 and once Hooker's at that of the Royal Society, which he called "our one truly great Society, a sort of Institute."30 Yet in "The Literary Influence of Academies" (1864) he had ignored the Society's existence, even suggesting that England might in time have "academies with a limited, special, scientific scope, in the vari- ous lines of intellectual work,-academies like that of Berlin, for in- stance."31 Of the great pioneers of science he had scarcely more than the intelli- gent layman's general knowledge. There is no evidence that he knew well the scientific works of Aristotle.32 Empedocles and presumably Lucre- tius33 interested him more as men than as natural philosophers. He did 18 Letters, II, 195. 19 Ibid., I, 146 (oolite). 20 Ibid., I, 10 (the angle subtended by Saturn). 21 GB, p. 76. 22 DA, pp. 96-97, 109; cf.

Arnold's tragedy Lucretius was 278</page><page sequence="5">Fred A. Dudley 279 understand how radically the spirit of Galileo was opposed to that of scholasticism,34 and he wrote a penetrating positivistic analysis of the ontology of Descartes.35 He referred to Newton36 with high admiration and something of British pride, but without evidence of close famili- arity.37 Goethe, of course, he read copiously and admired without reserve, praising his "profound, imperturbable naturalism"38 and gratefully acknowledging his influence.39 But Goethe's importance in the history of scientific thought is disputed;40 and Arnold clearly cared more for his philosophical and artistic naturalism than for his intuitions and eccen- tricities in geology, botany, osteology, or optics. Darwin he treated with- out great respect, and at least once with most unscientific high-handed- ness.41 It is doubtful, then, that his conception of physical science was ade- quate. Mr. Lionel Trilling justly remarks that Arnold was "committed to a method of science purely empirical-and not very strict,"42 that he thought "of science as empirical and classificatory rather than experi- never finished, and the fragment preserved as epigraph to Thyrsis tells us little. But for the close connection between the unpublished tragedy and Empedocles, see Tinker and Lowry, op. cit., pp. 292--297, 340-347. 34 "Nothing, indeed, could be more surely fatal to scholasticism... than the growth of positive and experimental science . . ."

SPP, p. 84. This wording is hardly what would be natural for one who knew that Newton had made famous researches, partly erroneous, into the nature of light. It is probable, anyway, that Arnold could no more have read Newton's language than I can; he confessed, "the mathematics were ever foolish- ness to me."

John W. Judd, The Coming of Evolution (Cambridge, 1911, pp. 3-4) reports hearing Arnold say in 1871: "I cannot understand why you scientific people make such a fuss about Darwin. Why it's all in Lucretius." When Judd remarked that Darwin had proved what Lucretius only guessed, Arnold rejoined that this power of intuition proved Lucretius the greater.

It shows no real grasp of hypothesis and deduction, of the exploratory purposiveness of experimentation, of the tentative- ness of scientific truth. What science in education can give us, says Arnold, is the "excellent discipline" of "the habit of dealing with facts" ;46 what science can save us is the folly of running counter to "the true, firm, intelligible law of things."47 The scientist is merely the faithful re- corder of what in the visible world any patient, accurate, fact-respecting observer may find.48 And to the discovery of facts,-scientific, religious, educational, or political-the only serious obstacle is prejudice.49 When Arnold called himself "scientific" he meant "impartial."50 Beyond the disinterested recognition of facts, his own characteristic instrument of criticism was a perceptive tact, a cultivated sense for human values, which he thought a cultural or literary and not a scientific attainment.5' And however unsatisfactory this judgment may be for the scientist, it is clearly right for Arnold, and probably for the average layman. "The exact sciences . . . stir the whole man less than letters and philosophy."52 When Arnold prefers to take "the true sense of animals, or water, or plants," from Shakespeare, Keats, Chateaubriand, or Senancour, rather than from Linnaeus, Cavendish, or Cuvier,53 he is only echoing Words- worth on what happens when "the remotest discoveries of the Chemist" become "manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffer- 43 Ibid., p. 318. 44 "t... the highest reach of science is, one may say, an inventive power, a faculty of divination, akin to the highest power exercised in poetry; therefore, a nation whose spirit is characterised by energy may well be eminent in science;-and we have Newton."

Trilling, op. cit., p. 358. 49 " 'Knowledge is easy,' says the wise man, 'to him that understandeth'; easy, he means, to him who will use his mind simply and rationally, and not to make him think he can know what he cannot, or to maintain, perfas et nefas, a false thesis with which he fancies his interests to be bound up."

Dudley ing beings,"54 and anticipating various modern critics55 who hold that the disquieting thing about science is the breach it makes between knowl- edge and feeling. Underlying Arnold's pronouncements upon the relation between science and culture56 is the idea that poetry has the power to effect the needed fusion. His cultural equation, so absurdly overprecise if taken literally, is yet worth restating here with still more extreme pre- cision: Conduct, morality, goodness (three-fourths), plus art, beauty, feeling, emotion (one-eighth), plus science, knowledge, truth (one-eighth, further divisible into an awareness of fact and an attitude of disinterested objectivity), equals Life, an integer, a perfect unity. II. Whatever the mood of religious uncertainty in Arnold's poems may have owed to science,57 he had come to believe by the late 'sixties58 that science could aid him in revitalizing Christianity. His religious essays, fairly bristling with the words science and scientific,59 reveal an unmistak- able emulation of the scientific spirit. After a false start in the hopeless direction of keeping religious liberalism esoteric,60 he took the ground that "the breach there is ... between popular religion and what is called science"6' could be closed only be abandoning theological meta- physics; that religion must establish itself, like science, upon verifiable propositions, or perish. But the hope that lay in science had not been grasped, he thought, by theologians, metaphysicians, textual critics, or utilitarian moralists. Each of these Arnold sought either to refute or to prove inadequate. The basic errors of traditional theology were to read the figurative language of the 64 Preface to Second Edition of Lyrical Ballads. 66 E. g.: H. V. Routh, Towards the Twentieth Century (New York and Cambridge, 1937); J. W. Beach, The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry (New York, 1936); G. M. Young, Victorian England: Portrait of an Age (London, 1936); Lionel Steven- son, Darwin Among the Poets (Chicago, 1932). 66 For some of the most characteristic of these pronouncements, see Letters to Clough, p. 135; CL, pp. 130-131; EC2, pp. 1-3; DA, pp. 118, 137. 67 Due allowance must be made for a youthful romantic melancholy and for Senancour. Mrs. Sells (Matthew Arnold and France, Cambridge, 1935) quotes, passim, enough of Obermann to prove that moods of gloom in Arnold, echoes of the aimlessness of nature and the futility of life, are not necessarily, perhaps not even probably, the results of direct reflection upon scientific theories. 58 SPP, separately published 1870, had appeared in the Cornhill Magazine beginning October, 1869. 69 In SPP, Part I (42 pp.), they occur at least 45 times; in two important short pas- sages (pp. 6-9 and 36-39), 17 and 19 times respectively. 60 Letters, I. 219 (1863); "The Bishop and the Philosopher" and "Dr. Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church," Macmillan's Magazine, vii (1863), 241-256, 327-336. 01 LD, p. 55; cf. ibid., p. xiii. 281</page><page sequence="8">Matthew Arnold and Science Bible as if it were literal, and to attribute to the propositions of creed a kind of accuracy belonging only to scientific statements. Literature, in- cluding the religious literature of the Jews, was an art; dogma was a pseudo-science62 grounded in misapprehension of such literature. By their insistence upon "the notion of God as a magnified and non-natural man,"63 as "a personal First Cause, that thinks and loves, the moral and intelligent governor of the universe,"64 by their "insane license of affirma- tion about God... [and] about a future state,"65 the exponents of "mechanical and materialising theology"65 were all but irreparably dam- aging the faith they sought to protect. The propositions of philosophical metaphysics, though less crudely anthropomorphic than those of the Three Creeds, were equally unverifiable. In this connection the passage of central interest is a comment upon the Cogito, ergo sum of Descartes.66 The concept of being to which it led seemed to Arnold a verbalism; and turning to the "natural history of the word"67 for a clue to its meaning, he traced68 the words is, be, exist, to the ancient roots as, bhu, sta, and so to the concrete meanings breathe, grow, stand. Admitting that the sense of figure had long been lost and that the words had become indispensable abstractions, he pointed out the error of supposing that they have in themselves anything absolute. The old roots "by a simple figure... declare a perceived energy and operation, nothing more .... But they have been falsely supposed to bring us news about the primal nature of things."69 It followed that "the etre of Descartes is an unprofitable term, because we do not clearly conceive what the term means,"70 and thus that to call God being was merely a concealed anthropomorphism. But if Descartes did religion little good, and if the "Bishops of Win- chester and Gloucester"71 did positive harm, the rational critics of Scrip- 62 It is curious that in books avowedly seeking a scientific basis for religious faith Arnold should have thought it wise to apply the word science ironically to just that kind of re- ligious view which he considered most perverse.

Dudley ture injured the Christian cause in another way. More "scientific," in a narrow sense, than the metaphysicians, they were hardly more useful, for they were not "edifying." On this ground Arnold objected to the work of Colenso (in contrast to that of Spinoza),72 to Essays and Reviews,73 to Strauss,73 even to Sainte-Beuve when he bade farewell "aux vieilles Bi- bles."74 As distasteful as merely rational exposures of Biblical inconsist- ency, and for the same reason, were merely scientific statements of ethical principles. Arnold's low estimate of Godwin,75 his scant and diminishing sympathy with Mill,76 his unvarying dislike for Spencer,77 his disparagement of Comte,78 all bear the same explanation: these men were joyless writers, cold analysts of conduct, without appeal to the heart. Theology and metaphysics, then, as pseudo-science, were pernicious; textual criticism and utilitarian ethics, as unedifying science, were inade- quate. Christianity must become soundly and adequately scientific. Negatively, this was to be accomplished by abandoning the traditional proofs from miracles and metaphysics.79 Science was not essentially hostile to religion. If only religionists would not pretend to know so much about the nature and temperament of deity, scientists would admit willingly and reverently the name of God, as a point in which the re- ligious and the scientific sense may meet, as the least inadequate name for that universal order which the intellect feels after as a law, and the heart feels after as a benefit.80 Positively, Arnold held that religion must seek its basis in the verifiable; that such a basis would be "scientific" or "rationally satisfying"; and that he found it. Declaring the "cardinal rule" of Literature and Dogma to be "that rule of Newton's: Hypotheses non fingo,"8' he rested his case upon the supposed reality82 that a good life brought joy, an evil life 72 "The Bishop and the Philosopher," loc. cit.

This, said Arnold, was verifiable scientific fact-this, but no more. Assertions about immortality or about the nature of God were not science, but figure; not fact, but poetry. As poetry, however, they were to Arnold of the highest importance for "the whole work of again cementing the alliance between the imagination and conduct,"84 for "the immense work between [religion and physical science], which is for literature to accomplish."85 Yielding to science everything that he thought it really demanded, emulating science in re- fusing to hold as fact anything not clearly supported, to his mind, by experience,86 he strove also to supplement science with poetry, retaining the Hebrew Bible and the Anglican ritual for the sake of edification. Weaknesses in this religious program are not hard to find. Arnold was not entirely clear about the logical relationship between science and re- ligion. His early sharp distinction between "truth of science and truth of religion,"87 consistent enough with his early effort to avoid conflict, was clearly echoed at least once during his long struggle to make religion "scientific."88 He seems thus to have confused his two senses of the word science. The word nature, now including and now excluding the specifi- cally human,89 created a similar semantic difficulty.90 The whole argu- ment depended upon the idea of "the natural truth of Christianity,"91 of the "grand style" meant solemnity and sadness, it is noteworthy that in his religious essays Arnold seems not in the least disturbed by the problem of Job, but secure in the ancient Hebrew wisdom, the assertion as self-evident fact that righteous living leads to joy.

Dudley the idea that "religion ... is a natural human need which will manage to satisfy itself";92 but Arnold could also declare that "Christianity is not natural," that what is natural is "to indulge our ordinary self";93 that "we do not suppose nature an Infinite Almighty and Moral Being; but ... we do suppose God such a being."94 More specifically, there was uncertainty whether scientific psychology was relevant or irrelevant to religious problems. He blamed Bishop Butler for "never entering" the "vast, dimly lighted, primordial region of the natural genesis of man's affections and principles";95 yet he airily waved aside the probings of Darwin into that very region: So let us take Mr. Darwin's doctrine and see how innocent it is, and how entirely unaffected religion is by it. But we will not take it from the mouth of that illustrious philosopher himself, because to so many religious people he is a bug- bear. ... No, we will take it from one of the clearest of thinkers, and one of the most religious of men, Pascal. "What is nature?" says Pascal. "Perhaps a first habit, as habit is a second nature." . . . Here, briefly and admirably expressed, is the famous doctrine of Mr. Darwin.96 This is enigmatic at best, and illustrates a certain arbitrariness in Ar- nold's treatment, for religious purposes, of scientific ideas. His idea of God, too, is an unsatisfactory compromise. From the reli- gious viewpoint, the objections have been well stated by Mr. Robert Shafer:97 that Arnold's repudiation of metaphysics is futile and irreli- gious; that his intellectual naturalism is radically inconsistent with his temperamental fondness for Christian moralists; that "all religious people ... would unite to repudiate"98 his definition of religion. From the naturalistic viewpoint, it is hard to admit that his conception of God is verifiable: a vague entity deprived of attributes and represented either by the formula, "that stream of tendency by which all things strive to 92 HSG, p. xxiii. 93 SPP, pp. xxix-xxx. 94 Ibid., pp. 296-297. 95 Ibid., p. 248. 96 GB, p. 125.

Irving Babbitt, Democracy and Leadership (Boston and New York, 1924), pp. 160-161. To Shafer's objections may be added some slight evidence of a sort of abstract polytheism. Arnold could speak seriously of "the law of intellectual beauty the eternal not ourselves that makes for intellectual beauty" (GB, p. 81), and could paral- lel the Greek personification of this force as Apollo and the Hebrew personification of righteousness as Jehovah, without seeing that he thus implied a plurality of eternal non- human forces. Some of his illustrative discussions of physical law (ibid., pp. 77-79, 84-85) seemed to imply an eternal not ourselves that makes for gravitation, and to leave the question open whether this was the same power as the depersonalized Jehovah, or another. Cf. the remarks quoted by Trilling (op. cit., p. 359, n) from F. H. Bradley, about "the Eternal not ourselves that makes for cleanliness" or "for longevity." 285</page><page sequence="12">Matthew Arnold and Science fulfill the law of their being,"99-that is, operation with a teleological element-or by another formula which he seemed to prefer,100 "the eternal power not ourselves that makes for righteousness"-that is, teleological operation with the added elements of duration, morality, and a supernatural or at least non-human quality. To prove this formula non- metaphysical Arnold simply defended his use of the word eternal. But the argument falls before the very attack he made upon Descartes;?01 and he forgot that his readers would certainly attach to his often capitalized'02 "Eternal" the notion of infinity. Further, that the impulse to do good is "not oneself,"'03 or that it represents the harmony of a "higher self" with an "eternal power not oneself," is an idea-or two ideas-not obviously scientific. That this power "makes for righteousness" is simply teleologi- cal anthropomorphism. As mediator between science and religion, then, Arnold failed to define either in acceptable terms. And there is a further difficulty. Poetry was to be the means of integration; but while Hebrew and Christian mythol- ogy, if repudiated as fact, undoubtedly retain a poetic value, it is doubt- ful that they retain also their distinctively religious power.'04 Praise or prayer addressed to an entity without either personality or consciousness, ritual symbolic of a truth entirely abstract, would seem unlikely long to satisfy the religious sense. And yet this notion of the importance of poetry, which is central not only in Arnold's religious essays but in everything he wrote, must be re- garded as a contribution of a kind. It saves the Bible as literature for those who are not interested in it either as revelation or as a set of prob- lems in linguistics or comparative folklore, and it points toward that "alliance between the imagination and conduct" for which Arnold strove, which the world still sadly needs, and which it apparently will not have upon the traditional orthodox terms. III. Science was not in Arnold's educational, as in his religious work, the pivotal conception;1?0 but it was by no means unimportant. His opin- 99 Arnold declares this definition scientific: "for science, God is simply the stream of tend- ency," etc. LD, p. 37. 100 Although at the close of LD (pp: 348-349) he declares in favor of the other formula as providing for all of life, whereas righteousness (conduct) is only three-fourths. 101 Admitting the idea of infinite duration to be unclear, Arnold held that the word eternal meant merely enduring, having a span beyond the life of a man or a race. (GB, p. 79) But if eternity is merely time extended, so is essence merely breathing glorified, or being merely growing etherealized. See above, p. 282. 102 E.g., GB, pp. xxxvii, xxxviii, 24, 30, 31, 94, 97. 103 See, e.g., SPP, p. 83. 104 This question is discussed by Trilling, op. cit., pp. 320-321, 363-365. 106 If there is any single master key to the writings of Arnold as Inspector of Schools, it 286</page><page sequence="13">Fred A. Dudley ions, it is true, were involved in a sort of double or even triple dilemma: his admiration for "seeing things as they really are" against his dislike for "special curiosities about birds and beasts";106 his recognition of the claims of "modern" studies against his reluctance to see the classical discipline weakened; his sad wonder that so few Englishmen were will- ing to view their schools objectively,107 against his impatience with "that somewhat terrible character, the scientific educator."'08 But on the teaching in the government-inspected schools his official comments were certainly not, for the most part, anti-scientific. He admitted that education could not and should not remain exclusively classical,'09 and predicted for non-classical training an increasing social prestige."0 To save school time for more "formative" instruction, he strove to restrict the teaching of science in elementary schools to Natur-kunde (introductory general science); but he never questioned the wisdom of including that;"' and he realized that its educative worth could not be fairly estimated until it was generally as well taught as the classics.l2 Further, he at- tributed to natural science particular educational values: a training in "perception,""3 and an "awakening" value,l4 especially for minds of narrow range. may perhaps be found in his conception of the nature and the proper functions of the State. His theory of "the true and noble science of politics" (ME, p. 403) has recently been sum- marized by B. E. Lippincott (Victorian Critics of Democracy, Minneapolis, 1938, pp. 93- 133), and more adequately if less compactly discussed by Trilling (op. cit.; see index, State; the passages referring especially to education are pp. 178-189; 384-385). On p. 71 it is ob- served that Dr. Thomas Arnold's coolness toward the teaching of science was due not to religious doubts but to a belief that science was irrelevant to political training.

He quoted without objection a complaint that an overload of "English grammar and English litera- ture, and French and German, and natural science," hindered the Irish schools from giving "a real education in literature and science"-mean- ing in classics and mathematics.l22 In his continental inspection tours he was never personally so much delighted by anything else as by excellence in the teaching of Latin and Greek;123 he confessed "a certain preposses- sion for schools conducted by ecclesiastics;"'23 and just before his retire- ment he wrote: I read five pages of Greek anthology every day, looking out all the words I do not know; this is what I shall always understand by education, and it does me good, and gives me great pleasure.l24 The common schools seem to have deserved his low opinion of the training they offered.'25 Nevertheless he served them well; his very mod- eration in the advocacy of his favorite studies indicates his effort to "see things as they were." Officially on educational and unofficially on reli- gious matters his pronouncements had at least this much in common: the wish to be impartial and observant ("scientific" in his own favorite 115 "The fruitful use of natural science itself depends, in a very great degree, on having effected in the whole man, by means of letters, a rise in what the political economists call the standard of life."

Dudley sense), the recognition that science had an important place in modern thought, and the advocacy of poetry as a humanizing corrective to mere fact-mindedness. There was, however, a gradual shift of emphasis, illustrated (to borrow evidence from outside the school reports) by a difference between his two articles on Sainte-Beuve.126 In 1869 he accounted for the excellence of the Causeries partly by calling their author a naturalist critic who sought out the facts in the method of scientific inquiry. In 1886 the praise was at least as high, but the words naturalistic and scientific had disappeared. Certain other essays indicate that this change can hardly have been accidental. Nowhere else did Arnold make such cordial overtures to science as in the Celtic lectures of 1865 and 1866.127 Students of ancient Welsh and Irish literature, he believed, should try to be as objective as the philolo- gists and anthropologists, whose contributions toward the understanding of race,128 led him repeatedly to attribute to science that very power of integration which he found more usually in poetry: Science's reconciling power ... philology ... again and again illustrates.... [T]rue science recognises in the bottom of her soul a law of ultimate fusion, of conciliation .... [Like] her elder and diviner sister, poetry ... continually she is showing us affinity where we imagined there was isolation.129 Such enthusiasm for the civilizing power of science would perhaps have been less likely in Arnold had the starting point been physics rather than philology. But for a time in the early and middle sixties he seemed espe- cially friendly to science, especially impressed by its respect for facts, and inclined on that account to assign it a high cultural value. This is evident also in the report of his second official tour of the Continent,l30 which 126 EC3, pp. 137-150; Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th ed., (American reprint, 1886), pp. 170-174. 127 The lectures have not been highly regarded from a philological point of view; and no claim that they are linguistically sound is here intended. They are cited for the sake of their comments upon science in general. Although Arnold attributed the comparative failure of the first lecture to its being "a little too scientific" (Letters, I, 371), it should be remembered that he disclaimed any special competence in the field (CL, pp. vii, 65, 68), urging, even while he advanced some dubious theories of his own, that the Celtic field was worthy of more scientific cultivation. 128 See CL, pp. 64-65, 137. Arnold here employed to unify and harmonize peoples an eth- nological theory which has been more commonly used to separate and antagonize them; see Trilling's remarks, op. cit., pp. 232-233. The subsequent discrediting of racism does not retroactively discredit Arnold for adopting it. 129 CL, p. 58. 130 1865. Arnold's report, dated 1866, had its official publication in 1868 (Schools Inquiry Commission Report, vi, 441-712). SUC (1868) was a separate trade edition of the same. It contained his strongest insistence upon England's unfortunate lack of the scientific 289</page><page sequence="16">AMatthew Arnold and Science contained his fullest utterance before "Literature and Science" upon the place of science in general culture. For the knowledge of self, of the human spirit, the great instrument was "the science of antiquity"; for the knowledge of the world, the study of nature and its laws; and though few men could follow both kinds of study, either might lead to vital knowledge, to true culture.13 Even here, however, Arnold maintained his lifelong belief in the cul- tural superiority of the classics: ... so long as the realists persist in cutting in two the circle of knowledge, so long do they leave . . . the better portion to their rivals, and in the government of human affairs their rivals will beat them. And for this reason. The study of letters is the study of the operation of human force, of human freedom and activity; the study of nature is the study of the operation of human limitation and passivity. The contemplation of human force and activity tends naturally to heighten our own force and activity; the contemplation of human limits and passivity tends rather to check it.132 By this theory of the limitations of science Arnold took away with one hand what he had given with the other. And from about 1867 onwards he had more to say about such limitations, and less about either the "kin- dling and awakening" or the "reconciling and unifying" power of science. Before the publication of the passage just quoted, he had already deliv- ered his Oxford valedictory,133 now known to us as "Sweetness and Light," with its presentation of science as considerably less than half of the circle of knowledge-as only one of many influences subordinate and contributory to culture.'34 This cooling of enthusiasm for science appears also in Arnold's reli- gious essays, in spite of their insistence that religion has, or can and should have, a scientific basis. The first of them were published some four years before the final Oxford lecture; the main series began two years after it. His religious conceptions had thus begun to take their character- spirit (pp. 276-280, 288); upon the intellectual superiority, in this respect, of France, Germany, and Italy (pp. 112, 150; somewhat ambiguous as to Italy; see pp. 113-114, 130- 131, and cf. Letters, I, 313); upon the inadequacy of scientific teaching in the English universities (pp. 222, 232, 288). 131 The discussion is worth reading at length: SUC, Ch. xxII, xxIII; reprinted with minor changes in HSG, Ch. vIII, ix. 132 SUC, p. 260; cf. CL, p. xiii: "The wise man, says Spinoza admirably, 'de humana im- potentia non nisi parce loqui curabit, at largiter de humane virtute seu potentia'." That the study of nature is actually detrimental to true culture, to "human force, . . . freedom and activity," is an extreme position hardly typical of Arnold; indeed, on the same page with the passage cited, he says that "no part of the circle of knowledge is common or un- clean, none is to be cried up at the expense of another." See Fitch, op. cit., p. 190. 133 June 15, 1867. 134 CA, p. 10. 290</page><page sequence="17">Fred A. Dudley istic form during the period of his greatest cordiality to science, but were not elaborately developed until that cordiality had somewhat moderated. Literature and Dogma, essaying to make religion scientific, began by chiding "the friends of natural science" for objecting to "the tyranny of letters."135 In the "Speech at Eton" (1879), knowing oneself and the world no longer meant knowing the classics and science; it meant knowing the classics.'36 The whole speech was a defense of classical education against the charge of antiquated uselessness; and the ironical references to "the diameter of the sun and moon" showed that the speaker was not inclined to yield much to the advocates of science. For the larger and less classically-minded public addressed in "Litera- ture and Science" he adopted a more conciliatory tone,137 but not the cordial manner of fifteen or twenty years earlier. Education still meant a knowledge of oneself and the world; but the latter sort of knowledge was now brought in by enlarging the term literature to "include what in mod- ern times has been thought and said by the great observers and knowers of nature," to include Galileo and Newton as well as Shakespeare and Dante.138 But since this meant merely "knowing the great results of the modern scientific study of nature,"'39 and neither the direct study of great scientific theorists nor actual experimentation, it was less of a concession than it seemed. The significant thing in "Literature and Science" was not the recognition of science but the defense of literature. It was the 135 LD, p. 3. This protest furnished the starting point for "Literature and Science" in its original form, now conveniently available in E. K. Brown's Representative Essays of Matthew Arnold (Toronto, 1936), pp. 186-209. 136 "... for this knowledge it is before all things needful that [one] acquaint [one]self with the best which has been thought and said in the world; ... of this best the classics of Greece and Rome form a very chief portion, and the portion most entirely satisfactory. With these conclusions lodged safe in one's mind, one is staunch on the side of the humani- ties" (ME, p. 411). A year earlier he had spoken of two distinct qualities "in the minds of those who, on the one hand, have the spirit of scientific inquirers, bent on seeing things as they really are, and on the other hand, the spirit of friends of the humane life, lovers of per- fection" (ibid., p. 72). 137 Still more conciliatory was the tone of his remarks about science in "A Liverpool Ad- dress" (loc. cit.), delivered a few months later. It was here, to an audience which included a faculty of medicine, that he spoke of having once contemplated a medical career (Trilling quotes the passage, op. cit., p. 359); it was here that he most specifically connected the word science with his formula, "to see the thing as in itself it really is" (see above, p. 276) -the word science, and another of his favorite words, lucidity: a sort of negative virtue, but one much needed by the English and exemplified by the scientist's ideal. 138 Here appeared once more, in close conjunction, the two senses of the word science. "A genuine humanism is scientific" (DA, p. 68) in the sense of Wissenschaft, or thorough- ness, order, and objectivity in knowledge of any sort, not in the sense advanced by Huxley of an accurate knowledge of the physical world. 139 DA, p. 95. 291</page><page sequence="18">Matthew Arnold and Science poets who "touched with emotion" not merely morality, but knowledge as well. That integration of life toward which Arnold strove was after all an emotional integration. Science was triumphant and inescapable; poetry was in eclipse, and though certain sooner or later to assert her- self, was sadly needed now. ... the majority of men will always require humane letters; and so much the more as they have the more and the greater results of science to relate to the need in man for conduct, and to the need in him for beauty.140 IV. Always believing that the English mind lacked something which he called now Hellenism, now eutrapelia or flexibility, now lucidity, Arnold became for a time in middle life persuaded that this something was nour- ished by the scientific discipline, that what England needed was more science, not less. Later, as natural science became more of a fetish and classical pursuits began visibly to lose prestige, he tended increasingly to decry the new emphasis. But his task is only superficially expressible as one of opposition to the new gospel of science. It is better summarized as a struggle to restore enthusiasm for life in the kind of world envisioned by rationalistic and naturalistic thought. As a lay critic of physical science itself, Arnold can hardly be regarded with great seriousness. He knew none of its branches in minute detail or in historic outline; his friendships with scientists did not lead him to a very active interest in their fields or a very precise notion of their work; and his reading included little of what is usually called "scientific." His pronouncements upon science are rendered somewhat elusive by his dual use of the word. His objectivity is made suspect by a fluctuating but seldom quite concealed impatience or dislike of science, especially in its factual aspect.141 As for its larger implications, he was both drawn toward naturalism and frightened by it. 142 And in his advocacy of poetry as a common denominator now between the natural and the supernatural, now between the intellectual and the emotional, his effectiveness at least was limited, if his own vision was not somewhat distorted, by that con- servatism which made him often seem less the champion of religion and literature than of Anglicanism and Greek.143 140 Ibid., p. 137-the closing words of "Literature and Science" in the final version. 141 See above, notes 26, 62, 132; see "The Twice Revised Code," Fraser's Magazine, Lxv (1862), 361-362; ME, pp. 410, 413, 429; Letters, ii. 96-97. 142 Cf. Shafer, op. cit., p. 173, and Beach, op. cit., p. 15. 143 There was reason, of course, in his urging that culture was empty without literature, ancient as well as modern; there was something unrealistic, for the nineteenth century, in his feeling that it was empty without a reading knowledge of Greek. For his regret over the displacement at Oxford of classic histories by histories in English, see Letters, II, 142-143. Reading knowledge aside, he somewhat overvalued even the knowledge of Greek authors 292</page><page sequence="19">Fred A. Dudley It cannot then be pretended that Arnold achieved a perfected cultural orientation to science. But the problem he faced is still unsolved. Human- ists are still announcing the limitations of science; religionists are still trying to reconcile knowledge and belief; educators are still disputing the question that Arnold and Huxley debated; poets are still groping for the keys to the laboratory and crying for someone to sing us the songs of science. Arnold faced the problem with courage and intelligence; and if not a convincing oracle upon it, he was at least a stimulating commenta- tor.14 Clearly pertinent in the nineteen-forties is his leaning toward a natural- istic ethics. Although he clung to a mystical "not ourselves," his natural- ism so far as it went may be regarded as courageous and encouraging rather than confused and depressing. Though Shafer considers it the radi- cal fault in Arnold's humanism,145 it is just as conceivably the hold by which he might have clung to ethical and aesthetic conceptions had he pushed his religious inquiries a little farther. Even on naturalistic prem- ises the human distinction between good and evil was valid for hu- manity; even if the moral perceptions were traceable to the animal instincts, they were yet "a sure, solid and sacred part of the constitution of human nature."'46 Finally, and of most importance from a literary viewpoint, he asserted powerfully the cultural worth of poetry in a scientific age.147 Whatever his uncertainties regarding science, he had full confidence in her "diviner sister." Science is intellectual, belles-lettres aesthetic, conduct moral; but poetry, adequately conceived, knows, feels, and judges all at once; it is a synthesizing force.'48 Perhaps the needful "poetry and eloquence" are less certainly Greek and Latin than Arnold believed; perhaps they are a and Greek culture; see Trilling (op. cit., p. 156) on "Arnold's failure to see that the sub- jectivism in romantic poetry had its roots in historical reality, that it could not be dis- missed by turning away from it to its seeming opposite, 'classical' objectivity."

Adams, that Arnold "paid curiously scant attention" to science ("Sweetness and Light-Sixty Years After," Atlantic Monthly, CXLIV ([1929], 633), seems hardly right in view of Arnold's innumerable if somewhat inconclusive references to it. 145 Op. cit., esp. pp. 167-168, 171-174. 146 GB, p. 128. 147 He gives an oddly naturalistic turn to literary tastes and standards when he attributes "to the instict of self-preservation in humanity" the preservation of the comedies of Aristophanes (EC3, p. 64); the devotion of men to the Bible (GB, p. 9); the survival of Greek as an important element in culture (DA, pp. 107, 131). 148 One aspect of "Arnold's claim upon the future" is stated by Professor Lowry as fol- lows: "More than any other of his contemporaries, he comes to us as the symbol of that quality which he himself believed would some day save the world-the quality that arises from the union of reason with imagination" (op. cit., p. 51). 293</page><page sequence="20">294 Mathew Arnold and Science poetry and eloquence yet unborn; or perhaps the integration they assist must be forever incomplete, cultural assimilation always lagging be- hind scientific discovery. And perhaps the technique of that integration cannot be more precisely understood than it was by Arnold himself: . . . how... are poetry and eloquence to exercise the power of relating the modern results of natural science to man's instinct for conduct, his instinct for beauty? ... I do not know how they will exercise it, but that they can and will exercise it I am sure.149 FRED A. DUDLEY Morehead State Teachers College 149 DA, p. 122.</page></plain_text>
