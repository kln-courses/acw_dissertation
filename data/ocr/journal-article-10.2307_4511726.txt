(In Enghsh, with summaries in Polish and Russian.)-A total of 8,920 individuals were banded along the Baltic coast, 1963 and 1964, for this study here well elaborated in considerable detail. The majority of the migrant population. 73%, were juvenals. Migration was in waves, the rate, maximum and mean, cor- related to the nutritional level of the birds. Spring migration was much more continuous, showing a much more normal graphic curve than that of autumn.- Leon Kelso. 3. A ringing study of the migratory Brown Shrike in West Malaysia.

Individuals are sedentary during the winter season, each occupying a restricted area and exhibiting terri- torial behavior. Some 11% of birds banded in each winter returned in the next: most of these were handled in the latter part of the winter of initial banding, sug- gesting that imprinting of the wintering grounds may occur during this period. Data are given on wing-lengths, weights (a mid-winter minimum in November), rmolt, and pre-migratory fattening. Autumn migrants arrive almost simultaneous- ly over a wide area in southeast Asia: those in Taiwan weigh 13% more than those arriving in Malaya 1,300 miles to the south.-I. C. T. Nisbet. 4.

World Conf. on Bird Hazards to Aircraft, Kingston, Ont.: 287-298.-Ultimately our understanding of the factors influencing bird migration must be measured by our ability to predict it numerically. As part of the continuing radar studies of migration in Alberta (see reviews nos. 7 and 8) Blokpoel attempted to provide a nightly forecast of bird activity which could be taken into account in planning aircraft operations. Forecasts were regarded as "accurate" if the observed migration, averaged over several hours, differed from that predicted by no more than 13' points on an 8-point scale of densities. On this basis, about 70 percent "accuracy" was achieved, but this level fell to 54 percent for the dense migrations which are of greatest concern. A substantial 51</page><page sequence="2">52] Recent Litercature Bird-Banding January, 1971 fraction of the errors can be attributed to errors in the weather forecasts, but even so there is a lot of room for improvement. The criteria used to derive predicted migration from predicted weather look too simple and inappropriately weighted. With improving post facto knowledge of factors affecting migration in the area these criteria will be revised; at the same time more detailed forecasts, of migration of birds of specific sizes and at specific times and heights, will be required. We will then need to know to what degree the forecasts are improved as additional detail is included: for this we need a more quantitative measure of agreement than Blokpoel's crude measure of "accuracy".-I.

World Conf. on Bird Hazards to Aircraft, Kingston, Ont.: 335-348.-A tracking radar aimed vertically upwards was used to sample migration densities at various altitudes over Cold Lake, Alberta, and hence to estimate the total density for comparison with other studies at the station (see reviews nos. 6 and 8). Of the birds flying over 1,200 feet, 50 percent were on the average below 3,500 feet, 90 percent below 5,000 feet and 99 percent below 10,000 feet. The highest echoes recorded were below 14,400 feet. Cloud cover and wind direction were probably the main factors influencing the height distributioni. -I. C. T. Nisbet. 8. Temporal variations in the volume of bird migration: a radar study in Canada. W. J. Richardson. 1970. Proc. World Conf. on Bird Hazards to Aircraft, Kingston, Ont.: 325-334.-Three years' radar data from Cold Lake in east-central Alberta revealed bird movements in all months of the year, but mainly in spring and autumn. The predominant directions were NW in spring and SE in autumn. Most large movements were in the western sectors of high pressure areas in spring, and in the eastern sectors in autumn, but this general picture was complicated by a number of observed movements in various sectors of lows. Wind direction was the best predictor of both direction and volume of migration. Inclusion of other weather factors did not improve the predictions significantly, but might do so if species could be distinguished for separate analy- sis.-I. C. T. Nisbet. 9.

Most swans fly on a front of only 100-150 miles from Chesapeake Bay to North Dakota, then north towards their arctic breeding grounds. Optimum conditions for mass spring departures are adequate rest and feeding time, followed by light tail winds in the early evening. Short trial flights sometimes occur in unfavorable weather.-I. C.

Cor- mack. 1970. J. Anim. Ecol., 39(1): 13-27.-This paper is another in a series on the population dynamics of the Dominican Gull (Larus dominicanus) about Wellington, New Zealand (see also review 6 of the April, 1970, issue). The present study covers the seasons of 1961-62 to 1964-65. The gulls about Wellington feed heavily upon garbage, with 86% of the stomach contents of sample specimens taken in 1961-62 being comprised of this item. The supply in past years has come from rubbish dumps and slaughterhouse remains. The latter appear to be of particular importance in their role in breeding success of local colonies. Contents of the dumps are now regularly buried (sanitary landfill), so the times that they can be utilized by gulls are limited. Since 1961 new regulations have reduced the amount of offal discharged from the slaughterhouses, with a consequent effect upon the gull population, which had been increasing rapidly since before 1900.</page><page sequence="4">Bird-Banding 54] Recent Literature January, 1971 Further effects were caused by reclamation work along the shore about one of the discharge areas, which effectively kept most gulls from feeding there. Close correlation was obtained between variation in the number of livestock slaughtered and the fledging success of gulls at the colonies utilizing these food sources. No comparisons are available for mortality figures before 1961. The majority of production occurred in colonies that were free from pre- dation. Ferrets (Mustela putorius), stoats (M. erminea) and rats (Rattus norvegi- cus), all introduced species, were the major sources of predation. Some flooding also destroyed nests in freshwater situations. However, of the eggs hatched, the killing of young by other gulls was the major source of mortality. This pattern of intraspecifically-imposed mortality was not random in its pattern, but generally increased from 1961-62 to 1964-65. It was not correlated with nest crowding, but was inversely associated with local food availability (from human sources). Interestingly, almost no cannibalism was noted, with the young gulls simply having theii skulls fractured. If a food shortage was involved, these dead young birds would provide an additional source of food. In many other large Larus gulls killing and subsequent cannibalism is an important source of mortality. Statistics on post-fledging survival of these birds are presented, and it is hypothesized that the populations still should be growing (though at a slower rate). The evidence presented on colony size does not permit evaluation of this statement. R. M. Cormack has contributed a statistical appendix, which contains the usual construction of a life table for this population. He also considers the prob- lems of using banding data and offers a number of precautions.-Douglass H. Morse. 19. Ornithological activity and the number of observations.

Studies on the biology of the Edible-Nest Swiftlets of South- East Asia. (Untersuchungen uber die Biologie der Salanganen von Sud-ost Asia.) Lord Medway. 1970. J. Orn., 111(2): 196-205. (Translated by E. Strese- mann from a paper in English published in the Malayan Nature Jour. 22: 57-63 in 1969.)-After a brief discussion by Dr. Stresemann of the systematics of the little swifts of the genus Collocalia Lord Medway informs us that these swiftlets are found from the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean east to New Guinea in the islands of the west and southwest Pacific. In the Malayan Peninsula two species with edible nests breed commonly: the black-nested C. maxima, and the white-nested, C. fuciphaga. The first species pulls its own feathers out and em- beds them into the nest saliva. The second builds its nest out of saliva alone. Chemical analysis of this nest cement shows it has little nutritional value, yet it is highly regarded by the Chinese foi its supposed medicinal properties. Harvest- ing of the nests is profitable to the owners of nesting colonies and should be care- fully regulated. The nesting cycle is prolonged; in C. maxima, that lays only one egg in a clotch, the average incubation lasts 28 days while fledging time takes 65. Since the swiftlets faithfully replace nests that have been removed, the approved system of harvesting is to take the first two nests and let the pair raise their third attempt In Java some of the knowing inhabitants construct artificial "nesting caves' inside their houses and thus enjoy a source of income with little trouble. The birds build where the light is dim and sometimes in complete darkness; here they find their way by uttering rapid "clicks"-i.e., by echolocation.-Margaret M. Nice 23.

Falkenorden, 1968: 65-66. (In German.) -The breeding of Peregrine Falcons on man-made structures is an especially interesting aspect of the ecology of this species, even though the number of known cases remains small. On the basis of Mebs' inquiries and from published accounts, a total of 30 unverified and 25 documented cases was ascertained for the period of the last 150 years. These are distributed among countries as follows (the first figure refers to unverified cases, the second to documented cases): Germany 9/12, France 2/0, Great Britain 4/3, Denmark 1/1, Sweden 1/0, Finland 1/0, USSR 4/0, Romania 1/1, Hungary 0/1, Yugoslavia 2/0, Italy 1/0, Spain 3/1, Morocco 1/0, Kenya 0/1, Canada 0/1, USA 0/4. About one half of the verified records refers to castles, ruins, bridge piers, and hunting platforms far from human settlements; the rest of the nestings took place on church towers, sky- scrapers, and other high buildings right in the middle of cities. The establishment of breeding sites in cities was most likely initiated by overwintering young in- dividuals, still lacking attachment to a specific nest site elsewhere, and was favored by an ample supply of food (feral pigeons). Mebs also discusses requirements and opportunities for successful breeding in cities. Kuhk comments on-and supplements some of the records listed by Mebs, and adds 3 records for Germany and one for Czechoslovakia. The reviewer can add one record for Turkey, where according to M. Q.

(In German.)-The authors' study area in northern Bavaria was covered with varied intensities during 1945-50, 1955-60, and 1965-68. Thirty-seven nests were located, including 24 during the breeding season. Population density, based on the mean distance between nests of 1352 m (extremes: 520 and 2000 m), was calculated at 132 to 220 hectares of forest per breeding pair. The authors believe this rel- atively high density to be due to an apparent abundance of wasps, evidently favored by extensive fruit and wine growing in the area.</page><page sequence="6">56] Recent Literature January, 1971 Breeding Biology: No preference for any particular tree type was apparent Twenty-one nests were new constructions, 16 were old, mostly built by Buteo buteo. The usual clutch size was 2 eggs; there was one verified and one suspected clutch of 3 eggs. Eggs were laid 3 days apart. The incubation period, determined for one egg, was 34 days. Nest success: Of 20 nests with complete data, 2 failed (1 clutch of 3 and 1 clutch of 2) and 18 were successful. Of 37 eggs (in successful nests), 4 (11%) failed to hatch.

Orn., 110(4): 421-447 (Summary in English).-This article describes experiences during two seasons in Kenya and Tanzania. Male Steganura paradisea defend their large territories throughout the day from males of the same species by conspicuous display flights. In 1966 in an area occupied by this species, out of 15 nests examined of the host species-the Melba Finch (Pytilia melba percivali) 13 were found parasitized and in the same area in 1969 34 of 36 host nests were parasitized. The hosts do not seem to suffer from this practice; although the nestling Widow Birds usually hatch a day before the "finches", are larger and more persistent beggars than the host chicks, yet the parents raise their own young as well as the interlopers. Re- lationships between parasite and host are very complicated: in courtship the male parasite sings the host's song and this song is essential to stimulate the female parasite to solicit copulation! The palates of the nestlings have similar spots in both parasite and host. Many other strange and surprising facts are given in this notable paper.- Margaret M. Nice. 26.

(Summary in English.)-Since very little reliable informa- tion has been published on the life history of this species, the author watched a nesting colony during three seasons and here reports his findings. "In a sedge meadow, with Carex elata the dominant species," males and females of this warbler held separate territories, "in some cases considerably overlapping ter- ritories held by other individuals of the same or opposite sex." Adults were dis- tinguished by colored bands; 13 nests were watched from blinds. There was no evidence of a firm pair bond between the sexes, "and probably the birds are even promiscuous. Females try to chase away males from the neighborhood of their nests. Aggressiveness between neighboring males has not been observed." Females alone incubate. Intensive observations on four females in 1961 showed the following rhythm: during 1504 minutes 76.7% of the time was spent on the nest, and 437 minutes (23.3%) off the nest. Attentive periods ranged from</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 42, No. 1 Recent Literature [57 5-39 minutes, averaging 15.7; inattentive periods ranged from 2-10 minutes, averaging 4.8.

ECOLOGY (See also 19, 22, 25, 26, 35, 66, 67, 85.) 31. The "niche-variation" hypothesis: a test and alternatives. M. Soule and B. R. Stewart. 1970. Amer. Nat 104(935): 85-97.-Van Valen's paper on morphological variation and the width of the ecological niche (Amer. Nat. 99: 377-390 1965) has been the subject of much recent interest (see also review 25 of the April 1970 issue). Soul6 and Stewart are particularly critical of Van Valen's hypothesis, even attacking the title of his paper on the grounds of his speaking about "width" of ecological niches, arguing that such a statement is anthropo- centric. Van Valen had examined bill sizes of mainland and island populations and found that the island ones showed greater variability than the mainland ones. He explained this as being the result of the island populations occupying wider niches, presumably as a result of the absence of competitors. To test his idea, Soule and Stewart examine series of skins of three euryphagous species and three stenophagic species, all from central Africa. These conditions are not identical to those tested by Van Valen, but should be relevant to his considerations. For euryphagous species the Pied Crow (Corvus albus), Blackeyed Bulbul (Pycno- notus barbatus), and Masked Weaver (Ploceus velatus) were chosen; for stenophagic species the Little Bee-eater (Merops pusillus), Jameson's Fire Finch (Lagononstica rhodopareia), and Bully Seedwater (Serinus sulphuratus) were used. First, it appears that Soule and Stewart are essentially comparing apples and oranges; while one might accept their statement that the first group was less specialized than the second, it would have been more appropriate to have searched for situations where a relatively 'specialized' and relatively 'generalized' species within a genus (or at least a family) could be chosen. The comparison of crows and finches in this regard seems a bit strained. Furthermore, one wonders whether the members of the euryphagous and stenophagic groups are as disparate in this regard as the authors claim. They may be, but little is said that will convince the reader. Only extremely general statements about their feeding techniques are</page><page sequence="8">58] Recent Literature Bird-Banding 58] Recent Literature January, 1971 supplied, even though the present authors state that correlation of diet-item diversity and variation are necessary conditions for Van Valen's hypothesis. To improve upon Van Valen's techniques it seems to me that we need very much more precise information upon foraging behavior than we find in this paper. Soule and Stewart state that the members of their euryphagous group have fewer competitors than those of the stenophagic group, which again may indeed be so, but with the general lack of precise information this assertion is so sweeping as to be of limited significance. The major basis for this statement is that con- geners are assumed to be each others' strongest competitors, and in the first group they are less numerous than in the second group. While this situation probably holds far more often than not, it again seems that at our point of our sophistica- tion, more convincing information than this is extremely desirable, if not necessary. Through the discussion, the conclusions drawn are that rather than finding marked variability about a single peak that they apparently felt was necessary to confirm Van Valen, they find sexual dimorphism in bill size occurring, which they feel refutes Van Valen's hypothesis. However, sexual dimorphism is aln expression of variability within a population and represents one possibility for increasing "niche width". While Van Valen indicates that the variation of species he in- vestigated did not suggest a polymorphic system or show greater sexual differences than on the mainland, he does not reject them as being inconsistent with his hypothesis, and in fact cites a number of probable examples of polymorphism from the literature. Soule and Stewart assert that to confirm Van Valent's hypothesis it would be necessary to find the marked variability they are searchitng for withini males and females. Such a stand ignores the fact that this dimorphism has ac- complished in part in an ecological sense what unimodal variation might be ex- pected to: that is, to provide different-sized implements for habitat exploitation. It is hardly a secret that this structural dimorphism is regularly found on islanlds (see Selander, 1966, Condor 68: 113-151). Having concluded that Van Valen's coniclusionis are inivalid, the presenit authors try to construct an alternative hypothesis, which to this reader appears little if at all more satisfying than the one they have chosen to reject. They present an involved discussion of canialization, and state that the differences that Van Valen reported may have been the result of a release of variation concomitant with deterioration of canalization. This may be all well and good, but its relevance to the argument is questionable. Even if this condition obtains, it does not bear unfavorably upon Van Valen's conclusions. If a species is canalized in a mainland situation, the release of suppressed genetic characteristics should be consistent with the Van Valen hypothesis. Van Valen has not hypothesized the in-depth genetic mechanism necessary to produce the desired result. Next, Soule and Stewart argue that according to Vani Valen's hypothesis if releases of canalization occur in certain island situationis, they should occur in others. While implying that there are many such examples, they mentioni only the geospizine, Pinaroloxias. One example does not make a new hypothesis. Certainly the ideas on the significance of lack of variation in island isolates are not par- simonious enough to rest firmly on a single example. In summary, I feel that the present paper has done little to advance thinking on this subject, other than to indicate that Van Valen picked a rather small group of species for comparison and could have profited from expanding his sample. It is becoming painfully obvious that what we need are measurements of known individuals whose behavior has been studied in the field in detail. Only then will we advance substantially in this area.-Douglass H. Morse. 32. Observations on Spotted and Crowned Sandgrouse in the North- west Sahara.

(Summary in English)-Two species of sandgrouse were studied in 1968 and 1969, the former year having enjoyed ample rainfall, the later being very hot and very dry. The Spotted Sandgrouse (Pterocles senegallus) inhabits semidesert; in 1968 a large population bred freely, but the next year only a few birds of a small population bred at all. The Crowned Sandgrouse (Pt. coronatus) inhabits true desert and five individuals were observed in the study area in 1968; however, in 1969 it had moved north of its original range and a number were found breeding.

Birds of a Euphorhia-Acacia woodland in Ethiopia: habitat and seasonal changes. E. W. Beals. 1970. J. Anim. Ecol., 39 (2): 277-297.-Specu- lations upon the characteristics of tropical populations and communities have occupied much time and interest of field biologists in recent years, but in spite of this fact, first-hand data are few. Beals' study (a two-year investigation of a five acre plot) is a welcomed exception to this dearth. This area supports a bird popu- lation that by our standards is remarkable. On the plot, which certainly does not contain an amount of vegatation comparable in volume to a tropical rain forest, Beals found a yearly breeding density of about 900 pairs per 100 acres, a figure two to five times what might be expected in eastein North America. In addition, at certain times of the year, large numbers of migrants were present. During the two years 37 species nested, and 102 species were observed, including migrants. Relatively few congeners were present, and when they did exist as breeding species, a marked tendency existed for their breeding seasons to be different. This factor was clearly defined even at a familial level. The problem of where migrants fit into a tropical community has occupied the interest of many workers. Beals notes that the periods of maximum numbers of migrants coincide with the periods of minimum breeding activity of the local species. Since the area in concern has a well-marked dry season that coincides with the influx of migrants, this timing should be advantageous to the residents. Whether or not causality is involved is not determined, though some other workers have hypothesized it. A number of rather widely accepted ideas are challenged by Beals oni the basis of his data, which, however, he rightly emphasizes to be from one small area However, the findings, if nothing else, should make us wish to reexamine some current opinion. He believes that the observed staggering of breeding seasons, particularly between ecologically comparable species, is a factor that may be responsible for at least part of the richness of this avifauna. Others have con- cluded that this factor contributed little to tropical diversity. He feels that the dry season in the Ethiopian Rift Valley is probably as adverse to life as are winters in the milder temperate regions. However, two rather different conditions are being considered here (moisture and temperature), and it is difficult to back such a conclusion one way or the other. The matter is of considerable importance, how- ever, because it is one piece of evidence used against the possibility of the great observed diversity being accounted for by the absence of conditions unfavorable to life processes. Beals believes that plant species diversity may have an effect upon bird species diversity, a factor that MacArthur and co-workers found to be relatively unimportant in certain temperate habitats. He brings up the familiar topic of whether or not niche overlap is greater in the tropics than elsewhere. He believes that it is not and that there is little information to support the contrary assump- tion. An interesting proposal put forth is that the long period of nestinig observed may be the result of interspecific interactions. Since the present study involved only a single small plot, the critical data are not available to test this assumption adequately. Analysis of other areas would be helpful to test this assumption. It is heartening to see the recent increase in number of data-filled papers dealing with tropical biology. The theory has been hotly debated, and the time has arrived to obtain the information that will link it with fact.-Douglas H. Morse. CONSERVATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (See also 21, 23, 68.) 34.

Red Kites that bred in South Sweden used to be migratory, but in the latter part of the 1950's and ever since, between 20 and 40 birds have been wintering in Scania. "The change in the migratory pattern is regarded as a consequence of changed food habits, refuse dumps and similar sites being used much more than previously. There seem to be small losses only among the wintering birds." Similar situations occur with other species: for instance, the Buzzard (Buteo buteo) finds additional prey in the victims of the automobile, while the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), that feasts on city garbage, is increasing out of all reason. -Margaret M.

Most northern migrants winter in the more arid habitats, which are being modi- fied by man only to a limited extent, and by traditional methods.

ZOOGEOGRAPHY AND DISTRIBUTION (See also 21, 45, 92, 93, 94.) 65. Stage of taxon cycle and distribution of birds on Jamaica Greater Antilles. R. E. Ricklefs. Evolution, 24(2): 475-477. A number of workers have suggested that as island groups are colonized by species, these species display particular patterns of distributions within the habitats available VVhen a species is initially invading a series of islands, it will typically show little differentiation and will be characteristically found in marginal habitats, except on small islands. At a later time, subspeciation may be ncted and there may be local extinctions. Eventually, remaining species of such colonizations will become endemics. As this so-called "taxon cycle" progresses, the populations in considera- tion become characteristic of the central and montane parts of the islands rather than the fringes or marginal areas. Ricklefs reports on some observations of birds made on Jamaica, which are generally in concuIrence with the pattern reported above, but which show some variation. Briefly, the major difference involves the undifferentiated forms which he found to be abundant and widespread with respect to habitat. Since the sources cited for comparison (Wilson's study of Melanesian ants, Amer Nat., 95: 169-193, 1961; Greenslade's study of freshwater and land birds in the Solomons, Evoluton, 22: 751-761, 1968) often involve small islands that have been less thoroughly altered in recent times than those of the Greater Antilles one wonders whether they are directly comparable. Could some of the difference be due to the extensive human disturbances that have occurred in ,Jamaica?- Douglass H. Morse. 66. Insular biogeography in continental regions. I. The northern Andes of South America. F. Vuilleumier. 1970. Amer. Nat., 104 (938). 373- 388.-In recent years, the biogeography of islands has received a great deal of attention from biogeographers, ecologists and evolutionary biologists. This is for good reason, as they ofler a number of unique advantages for studying such phenomena as colonization and extinction patterns, habitat utilization, and ecological release. In spite of the interest directed toward oceanic islands, other "ecological islands" have been accorded much less attention. Among the most likely areas for study are the tops of high mountains, which are isolated in space and time from other similar areas. In this paper Vuilleumier explores the avian distr?butional patterns found in several patches of pirame vegetation (above the treellne) of the northern Andes. The data presented are the result of extensive field work in that area by the author, plus additional information from the litera- ture. Fifteen "islands" are considered in this study, and the data gathered from them are compared with comparable data from oceanic islands. Three measure- ments were taken from each "island": area, elevation, and base altitude. Four inter-island measurements were also made distance from source, distance to nearest island, distance to nearest island to south (previous studies had deter- mined that the p§.ramo avifauna has spread uniformly from the south northward) and distance to the nearest large island (over 200 sq. km.). To test his assumptions and to determine which of the above-mentioned variables contribute most heavily to diversity and endemism, Vuilleumier utilizes stepwise multiple regression with linear, semi-log, and log-log models. The num- ber of species iS correlated positively with area. With the linear model, area is the best single predictor of the number of species, with distance to nearest island to south and elevatiorl also contributing significantly. With a semilog model, the distance from the large southern pAramo was the most important predictor. The fit to the linear model is better, however.</page><page sequence="16">.66 Recent Literature Bird-Banding 66] Recent Literature January, 1971 Endemism is not correlated with area, as was the case in a number of other published studies. With both linear and semilog models, distance to nearest large island and elevation are more important predictors than area. Species-area curves of paramo birds fall within those for oceanic areas. However, when percentage of faunal saturation is plotted against distance from source, the decrease proceeds in a more linear fashion than the exponential plot seen for oceanic islands. This may be due to the fact that potential colonizers of paramo vegetation have the opportunity to rest temporarily part of the way be- tween twc areas that might be favorable for reproduction, while individuals colon- izing an oceanic island will have no temporary haven and will die immediately if they cannot negotiate directly the gap to be covered. Also, during interglacial periods certain now-isolated mountain areas were connected, a situation not duplicated by truly oceanic islands. Thus, at such times the possibility of re- ceiving new propagules changes dramatically. This paper provides a fresh view of island biogeography, complete with in- formation from a rather different set of circumstances.-Douglass H. Morse. 67. Chilean bird distribution. M. L. Cody. 1970. Ecology, 51(3): 455- 464.-The local distributions of Chilean birds display marked differences from those of several other areas in temperate latitudes. A high percentage of land and fresh-water species breeding there occur in a wider variety of habitats than do comparable species in studies made thus far in other temperate aieas, habitats contain more species there than would be predicted from previous inivestigations in other temperate areas, and in only a few cases is there more than one species of a genus found in a habitat at a given locality. Representatives of extremely widely-distributed genera occupy the widest range of habitats in Chile. These include such well-known taxa as Troglodytes, Turdus, Zonotrichia, Mimuw, and Elaenia. Another group of typically South American genera also occupies a wide range of habitats within a particular latitudinal range, only to be replaced else- where by a congener. Included in this group are certain furnariids, tyrannids, and fringillids. A few genera have more than one representative in the same locality. These are in many cases also typically South American genera, though the genus Fulica (coots) is an exception. Plots of bird species diversity and habitat diversity fit North American and Australian patterns only if vegetational profiles are divided into four layers, rather than the typical three. While within-habitat bird species diversity is large, be- tween-habitat diversity is low. Cody suggests that this situation may be attribut- able to the isolation of Chile from other faunas by deserts and high mountains. Though the bird fauna is sizeable, Cody believes that it arrived slowly, with colonists spreading out considerably over a variety of vegetation types after arriving. Speciation upon arriving is largely prevented by the absence of north- south barriers within a considerable part of the country. This describes probable conditions of colonization that may differ from most continental areas, but does not explain why the Chilean species under these conditions have evolved a high within-habitat diversity and a low between-habitat diversity rather than the condition found in other temperate faunas. Cody suggests that the slow develop- ment of the bird fauna permitted early residents to occupy a wide variety of habitats within an area, with the result that when a successful newcomer arrived, it was difficult for that newcomer to exclude the older resident from all of the many habitats that it occupied. It is further suggested that once such a within- habitat diversity was established, food resources might not permit addition of new species that occupied a narrow range of habitats, because of the presence of other species. This argument is quite speculative, and it seems to me as if the in-detail basis for this interesting difference is still largely unsolved. A number of characteristics of this avifauna are considered in detail. Wheie congeners appear near each other, a high degree of interspecific territoriality exists. These species are extremely similar morphologically. Outside the breeding season these different similar species often join multi-species groups together. Thus, Cody believes that the plumage patterns serve both as territorial displays and as attracting mechanisms at another season. This is an interesting addition to Cody's series of papers upon character convergence. It raises some interesting questions, not all of which are answered.-Douglass H.

Several shortcomings make it difficult to evaluate the validity of their new genus. First, intra- and interspecific variation in size and morphology is very great among turkeys and the authors fail to discuss this in any detail. In this regard the authors do not mention how many skeletons of Recent and fossil turkeys were examined in order to evaluate the range of variation in the inclination and placement of the spur cone (which they use to separate several genera) and other morphological characters. Second, why were measure- ments of all the new fossil material not presented? Also, the photographs are too poor for accurate comparison witb other papers or specimens.

Geographic size variation in birds and its relationship to climate F. C. James. 1970. Ecology, 51:(3): 365-390.-Is Bergmann's Rule a valid general- ization? This is a question upon which opinion has been divided. In fact, accord- ing to James' translation of Bergmann's original paper (1847), there is some con- fusion over what it originally stated. The three major points appear to have been that the constant temperature of homeothermic organisms is maintained by a balance between the production of warmth within the volume of an animal and the loss of warmth from its surface, that the limitation of the ratio of a home- otherm's body surface to its volume is one of the factors determining its size, and that when other factors are constant the smaller species in a genus will occur in a warmer climate. This differs considerably from Mayr's definition in Animal Species and Evolution that races of warm-blooded vertebrates from cooler climates tend to be larger than races of the same species living in warmer climates.</page><page sequence="19">Vol. 42, No. 1 Recent Literature [69 Do either of these generalizations have any basis? James conducted a de- tailed survey of six largely resident species of eastern and central NorthAmerica (Hairy Woodpecker, Dendrocopos villosus; Downy Woodpecker, D. pubescens; Blue Jay, Cyanocitta cristata; Carolina Chickadee, Parus carolinensis; White- breasted Nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis; and Eastern Meadowlark, Sturnella magna) in order to evaluate the relationship between climate and size variation. Less detailed information was also obtained for another five species (Red-shouldered Hawk, Buteo lineatus; Sparrow Hawk, Falco sparverius; Screech Owl, Otus asio; Common Nighthawk, Chordeiles minor; and Yellow-shafted Flicker, Colaptes auratus). Wing (chord) measurements were obtained from over 4,000 specimens, mostly from museums, this measurement serving as an estimate of overall size. Precautions were taken to minimize variations due to sex, age, or season. Where populations were considered migratory, only breeding-season specimens were used. The data revealed a close coirelation with combined effects of humidity and temperature. Consideration of this pair of factors appears to resolve several cases where apparent exceptions to Bergmann's Rule have been suggested. Considera- tions in this paper have been on an intraspecific level, which was not that sug- gested by Bergmann, his level being the intrageneric. James makes no evaluation of this phenomenon above the specific level. At the intraspecific level, she proposes to modify the statement to indicate that size variation in homeotherms is related to climatic variables, including temperature and moisture, working in combina- tion. Small size is associated with hot or humid conditions, large size with cool or dry conditions. The usual explanations accounting for the adaptive basis of this variation are aired, and the objections to them are considered.-Douglass H. Morse. 80. The effect of experience and novelty on avian feeding behavior with reference to the evolution of warning coloration in butterflies. II. Reactions of naive birds to novel insects. R. P. Coppinger. 1970. Amer. Nat., 104(938): 323-335.-What factors determine whether a predator will attack an unfamiliar prey object? In an earlier paper Coppinger reported that at least in his system (avian predators and insect prey) rejections of novel objects were not infrequent; furthermore, they were often accompanied by behavior on the part of the predator. Here he reports upon attempts to determine whether this behavior is innate or learned. Naive (hand-reared) birds of three species (Blue Jays, Cyanocitta cristata; Common Grackle, Quiscalus quiscula; Red-winged Blackbird, Agelaius phoeniceus) were utilized as predators, and three species of frozen nymphaline butterflies from Trinidad served as test material. Prior to presentation of this material, all birds were trained to eat mealworms. The significance of this point to the experiments only became evident much later in the paper. The results again indicate that these birds often avoid novel stimuli, and furthermore they reject these stimuli in a way indicating that the basis was (according to Coppinger) neither learned or innate. Rather, the amount of differ- ence between the novel stimulus and previously experienced ones was of apparent considerable importance. Though not considered by Coppinger to be the result of learning, it seems to the reviewer that the responses have to be considered at least an indirect manifestation of learned behavior. The argument here is only semantic. These results would suggest that there need be no association with noxiousness in order for selection to proceed for conspicuousness. However, if such conspicuous items frequently are noxious and the general sort of learning indicated above exists, then avoidance of conspicuous items may often be advantageous, and even though no special resemblances exist. The resemblance may be only conspicuous- ness, which might even be considered a special example of Muellerian mimicry. Regardless of the interpretation, the avoidance of novel stimuli increases the opportunity for new mutants to be established. This is a satisfying solution to a problem raised by R. A. Fisher many years ago. Fisher was concerned that if an original mutant possessed a distinctive pattern, it would have to be sampled in order that its noxious quality be detected. It thus might be eliminated long before it could become established in the population, and before its warning device could become recognized by predators.-Douglass H. Morse.</page><page sequence="20">Bird-Banding 70] Recent Literature January, 1971 81. Genetics of melanism in the Fantail Rhipidura fAliginosa. G. Caughley. Notornis, 16: 237-240.-Reanalysis of data by Oliver (New Zeatand Birds, 1955) shows that melanism in the South Island Fantail is caused by a single dominant allele and is not recessive to the Pied allele as thought. Heterosis and panmictic mating hold the allele at a frequency of about 7% in the population, thus causing the frequency of melanistic birds to be about 13%. The hypothesis by Oliver that the pied and black forms are "semi-species" is inconsistent with this clarified interpretation of the genetics of melanism in the Fantail.-Jack P. Hailman. 82. Convergence between jacamars and bee-eaters. C. H. Fry. 1970. Ibis, 112: 257-259.-This note discusses convergence in some behavioral and ecological features, especially those associated with feeding. The diet of both families consists of about 80-85 percent Hymenoptera. Both families also nest in holes, have similar clutch sizes, incubation and fledging periods, and lack pro- nounced sexual dimorphism in plumage. The causal factors of this convergence have not been adequately explained, but Fry suggests that the social organization is probably similar in the two groups.-Joel Cracraft. 83. Independent evolution of the Dodo and the Solitaire. R. W. Storer. 1970. Auk, 87: 369-370.-This unhappy little note contains several ideas that I hope will not gain credence with the ornithological public. Storer asserts that because the Dodo of Mauritius and the Solitaire of Rodrigues are structurally different and are found on widely separated islands that would preclude rafting of a large flightless bird, the Dodo and the Solitaire were derived independently from flying ancestors and should be accorded the stutus of separate families. He speculates that if and when remains of the large "didine" bird(s) of Reunion (as yet known only from old contemporary reports) are found, that "they will prove to be unrelated either to the Dodo or the Solitaire," and that they may have been "derived from rails or some group other than pigeons." He goes on to cite the work of Luttschwager as proposing the descent of the Dodo and Solitarie from rails. I have examined Luttschwager's papers on this subject (Zool. Anzeiger, 162: 127-148, 1959 and "Die Drontevogel" in Die Neue Brehm-Bucherei series, 1961) and find them less than convincing. The characteris- tics of Dodos and Solitaries that Lulttschwager gives as differing from typical doves and as resembling flightless rails are mostly those that may be attributed to flightlessness and are not useful indicators of relationship. Nowhere does he offer convincing evidence that the didine birds are derived from rails and indeed this would be most difficult to do since they are not. The skeletal elements of the Dodo and Solitaire that I have examined are so markedly columbiform that to postulate any other origin seems preposterous to me. Even the vestigial wing bones retain a remarkable resemblance to columbids, despite their loss of function. As to the "separate evolutioni" of the Dodo and Solitaire, this is true for at least part of their history, as they are different birds found on different islands. But bear in mind that although pigeons and doves have reached many isolated islands, nowhere save the Mascarenes, have they differentiated into large flight- less forms. It is not unreasonable to assume that the Dodo-like birds of the Mas- carenes were derived from a common columbiform ancestor which colonised all three islands before having lost the ability to fly and that these species are more closely related to each other than to any other known taxa. Contrary to Storer, I would be most surprised if the didine bird of Reunion proves to be anything other than columbiform.-Storrs L. Olson. 84.

On their foraging territories the in- vertebrate biomass was measured by locally devised methods, July &amp; August, 1968, at "Kharp" station at the polar terminal of the Ural Mountains. By comn- parison of calculated food requirements with amount actually provided the young, it was found that the latter was less than the need; also that there was a definite adherence to energy balance of young under tundra conditions. The adults foraging exerted a definite effect on numbers of invertebrates, effecting a definite role in tundra communities. In the nesting period the calculated young consumption was 30-45% of the invertebrate biomass in the foraging territories. Avian occupation of forest-tundra zone communities was close to saturationl. Arachnids predominated over insects in the territories, and were prominent in the food brought to the young. Notwithstanding the illumination was 24-hour dayround, cessation of feeding came at equivalent midnight; the active day of the Bluethroat being 19, Longspur 20, and Little Bunting 21 hours.

These trees usually produce good crops in synchrony, so that the Siskin populations in good years are hundreds of times larger than those in bad years. The numbers seen on autumn migration fluctuate correspondingly, but the dates of passage are similar in good and bad years (in contrast to an earlier report from Sweden). There is evidence that the breeding range shifts from year to year in accordance with the seed crop of spruce, and that the breeding season is longer in good seed years. -I. C. T. Nisbet. 87.

In this study, he compares the singing of male warblers on small isolated islands (one warbler pair per island) with those on a nearby large island. The song thought to be given to other males is almost absent on the small islands, while the other song is more frequent through most of the season.

(In Russian, with English titles.)-In honor of one of the most distinguished Russian zoologists of his time, who pub- lished extensively outside as well as inside Russia, and even traveled widely, spending about 2 years in the U. S., this volume comprises a foreword and mem- orial appreciation by A. I. Ivanov, nine ornithological papers and two pages of abstract summaries. Dispersal of the pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, in the deserts of central Asia, by E. V. Kozlova, emphasizes its taxonomic variation, and also relates memories of Sushkin's work on the topic and as a teacher. P. P. Sushkin as faunist and zoogeographer, by L. A. Portenko, enlarges in considerable detail on his work in those fields. The biological significance and evolution of cranial kinesis in birds, by K. A. Yudin, presents an ample historical review, with bibliography of 47 titles and 12 figures, plus also additional work of his own and discussion of recent studies by Bock, Zusi and others. A survey of ornithological explorations in Karelia, by I. A. Neufeldt, is historical and very detailed, with a bibliography of 209 titles, and a list of the 231 bird species recorded. The downy young of some Asian birds, also by Neufeldt, emphasizes need for details of newly hatched young, and gives descriptions of 86 species, mostly passerine, of such, many pre- viously undescribed, with sharp photographs of 27 of them. There is also a table of data on down plumage of 251 species of Asiatic bird nestlings gleaned from other authors, in a bibliography of 68 titles. There is a section on c llection and pre- paration, with notes on the institute's special collection of nestlings. Zoological subdivisions of northeastern Asia based on the distribution of birds, by L. A. Portenko, defines the arctic and Euro-Siberian zoogeographic subregions, 3 provinces, 7 sub- provinces, 8 districts, and 4 special sections of the region, listing their definitive bird species, and discusses their relationship to arctic America. Comparative survey of the Spruce Grouse (Falcipennis and Canachites, Tetraonicae) of Asia and North America, by R. L. Potapov, attempts a general monograph of the group, finding the species congeneric under the Elliot name Falcipennis, with ample review and discussion of recent contributions by American authors. Morpho- logical features of penguin wings, by the eminent anatomist B. K. Stegmann, illustrated by 8 figures, finds much to disagree with in the conclusions of Lowe and others, particularly that the non-pneumatic nature of penguin bones does not preclude their origin from flying ancestors. On reduction of wing muscalature during evolution of Class Aves, by Stegmann, with 8 figures, makes a strong case for overall evolutionary simplification of the mechanism of bird flight, the hummingbirds for example retaining fewer wing muscles than the flightless penguins. The book as a whole is a worthy memorial and a landmark in Russian ornithology.-Leon Kelso.</page></plain_text>
