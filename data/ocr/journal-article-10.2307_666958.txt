Reviewed by MARSHALL D. SAHLINS, The University of Michigan Not long ago, in the review section of a national magazine, the genre "nonbook" was invented to refer to the cavalier (but profitable) binding between hard covers of materials which bear the signature of a well-known person but lack the status of a book in content, style, or organization. Sociological Aspects of Economic Growth seems to be another in a growing list of academic nonbooks. Perhaps some businesslike competi- tion between scholars and universities is involved in the trend, but the academic non- book is probably more the responsibility of businesslike publishers. Veblen would have expected and would have understood this latest penetration by the business outlook in- to the higher learning in America. One might just imagine his cynical castigation: a capitalization on one scholar's good name at the cost of the community of scholars at large to the pecuniary advantage of the vested publishing interests. Professor Bert F. Hoselitz's book belongs in this genre not because it is a collection of nine of his essays, each of which has been separately published over the last decade, but because the essays fail to move from point to point along a particular line of argu- ment, to bear one upon the other. The lack of organic unity may be the reason the book has neither an expository introduction or an integrating summary. The contents range from an article on the possible relevance of classical economic theories for understanding present trends in backward regions to a final series of three pieces on the relation between urbanization and economic growth. The main continuity, however, comes from repetition of certain refrains in the several essays, balanced contrapuntally here and there by some inconsistencies. The structure of the book deepens an impression suggested by its content: the new Social Science eclecticism in Development Economics fails to isolate the central trends of the revolution in the underdeveloped world and fails also to advance a coherent theoretical view of this revolution. In the absence of a coherent theory, it is fair only to speak of the main drift or the prevailing spirit of the Hoselitz essays. The prevailing spirit is intellectual withdrawal from the realities of the revolution in the backward areas. The over-all effect is of a Methodological Waterloo. Retreat is imminent in the characteristic opening move: a priori caution, the communication of a sense of futility about the possbility of under- standing it all. It is not so much the legitimate caution with which one might conclude a contemplation of the evidence-a statement, say, to the effect that "this is the way I see it; the facts appear to support my view; I may be wrong." Rather, hesitancy precedes contemplation and irretrievably deflects it. Hoselitz repeatedly raises issues about development too "formidable" for treatment "in the confines of this essay." In- stead of truly narrowing or simplifying the problem, however, he then effects a with- drawal into a sort of Social Science Never-Never Land populated by Methods and Concepts. Intellectual sanctuary. Here one never directly encounters, or even need mention by name, the world-historical realities involved in the spread of the in- dustrial revolution to the backward areas. A list of the forces and events not considered 1063</page><page sequence="2">1064 A merican A nthropologist by Hoselitz in terms of their familiar properties would be close to an index of modern history: colonialism and economic imperialism; nationalism; "socialist construction"; social revolution; the cold war; the neutralist bloc; technical qualities and social im- plications of advanced industry and of new energy sources; "uneven proportions," "combined development," and "the privilege of historic backwardness"; the potential revolution in agriculture and its received social impediments; new classes and class struggles; and so on and so on. Hesitancy before reality becomes a central premise of method, a canon of analysis, in Hoselitz's use of "models" and "ideal types." Many of the models employed to discuss past and future economic progress are paired verbal distinctions (or combina- tions thereof), such as government control versus laissezfaire, autarchic versus satellitic growth, and so forth. Hoselitz's qualification of the autarchy-satellitic "model" is characteristic: "It is obvious that neither of these two extremes is, or ever can be, realized in practice. But we find some actual cases in which the one or the other ex- treme was or is approached more or less closely" (p. 93). And what if the extremes are not decisively drawn, are only more-or-less distinctions? Government control ("in- duced growth"), for example, is opposed to laissez faire ("autonomous growth") so equivocally that the distinction is admittedly subject to continuing "confusion" (p. 101). The probability of reaching right conclusions by posing conceptual categories more or less distinct for grasping realities which they more or less describe seems- more or less-equal to chance. Often, where the models lack validity, the probability of right conclusions falls below chance. Hoselitz's models are frequently drawn from past courses of economic growth, particularly of capitalist-economic growth, and projected into the present, the future, and around the world. It is as if underdeveloped regions could progress in vacuo, could gradually recapitulate past history while standing aside from the intense selective forces deployed by that history on the present world scene. But this is just what under- developed countries cannot do, and because they cannot, just why their industrial revolution is so unprecedented. The backward areas are not insulated from main his- torical events. It is impossible for them to develop apart from the existence of already industrialized nations, and from the past and sustained propensities of these nations, these world powers, to harness other areas to their own development. The functional engagement with dominant powers, in combination with the opportunity to take over the most advanced products of the accomplished industrial revolution of the West, de- crees for the backward areas (insofar as particular circumstances permit) a new course of progress which in important respects reverses the path of history-as in the relation between government "interference" and sustained industrial growth, or between the advance of producer goods and consumer goods industries (see Rich Lands and Poor, by Gunnar Myrdal, New York, Harper and Bros., 1957; "The Law of Evolutionary Potential," by Elman R. Service, in Evolution and Culture, M. Sahlins and E. R. Service, eds., Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1960; The Military and Industrial Revolution of Our Time, by Fritz Sternberg, New York, Frederick A. Praeger, 1959, especially pp. 190-94). The current inversion in underdeveloped countries of the familiar evolutionary path makes questionable the use of models drawn from the original industrial revolution. And some of Hoselitz's models of economic "develop- ment" are questionable in the light of past history, let alone of present circumstance. The Congo under Belgian rule or the Maori of 1840-1860, used to exemplify certain courses of economic growth, are more fruitfully considered preludes to economic and social catastrophe. [64, 1962]</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1065 Here is another problem. The failure to confront the major historical forces acting on the underdeveloped world, the lack of a coherent perspective on development, and the a priori uncertainty, suggest something unpromising about the actual possibilities of rapid progress. If Marxism, as Adam Ulam plausibly argues (The Unfinished Revolu- tion, New York, Random House, 1960), is readily adopted in underdeveloped countries because of its "revolutionary optimism," then the new eclecticism is likely to be as readily rejected for what might be appraised "counter-revolutionary pessimism." It is seriously vulnerable to this kind of Marxist criticism: Dwelling on the technical aspects of economic development, they [bourgeois theoretical econo- mists] discover a host of insuperable difficulties preventing the formulation of a coherent theory of economic and social change. They list with obvious relish all and sundry matters more or less germane to the problem of economic development about which "we do not know enough" . . . they elaborate on the obstacles to industrialization stemming from the character of the labor force in underdeveloped countries, from the scarcity of native managerial talent, from likely balances of payments disequilibria-with the result that all efforts at rapid development appear as adven- tures on uncharted seas ... (p. 16, The Political Economy of Growth, by Paul A. Baran, New York, Monthly Review Press, 1957; also see p. 17 on cultural relativism). Let us stand in the present discussion au dessus de la melee. The conspiratorial allegations in such criticism deserve summary rejection: they merely add a weak link to the chain of social causation of ideas. But the central issue deserves serious considera- tion. Pessimism and theoretical futility exist, not only in the Hoselitz essays but in works of many Western experts on economic development. On the other hand, op- timism exudes from Marxist writings on the underdeveloped world. It would be wrong to lay the Western inclinations to realistic scientific caution while writing off the Marx- ist as heady revolutionary idealism. There is as much a general structural basis for the one as for the other. It is relevant that Hoselitz's arguments for particular economic policies, and many of his predictions, as much as the next man's, rest on the unargued desirability of a certain moral-political course (see below; also pp. 79-80, "Consensus and Discussions on Economic Growth: Concluding Remarks to a Conference," Economic Development and Cultural Change VI, 1957, by W. A. Lewis). Granted that the optimism of Marxism stems from the dominance objectives of the communist bloc, the hesitancy of the West has an equally compelling base in the attempt to head the challenge, to maintain the West's historic dominance. The world position of the West has rested importantly on an international economic gap. Underdevelopment has not been a simple internal condition of poverty and cultural backwardness, but a tributary relation of the rest of the world to the first industrial powers. A rapid, autonomous industrial development in backward areas at the least would liquidate many present Western economic advantages. Therefore, the popularity in the West of a perspective on in- dustrialization that is hesitant, not coherent, full of matters "about which 'we do not know enough,' " and above all ignores gathering evolutionary trends, seems better understood as social ideology than as Olympian scientific caution. The main argument of most of the Hoselitz essays is that "non-economic" social and cultural "factors" are somehow important for industrial growth. Social-cultural factors, however, are not viewed in the received anthropological sense of elements of a cultural system: class and governmental structure, forms of technology, foreign-political relations, and the like. A perspective on culture as a distinct order of phenomena with its own (nonanthropomorphic) properties, a view of the systematic connections be- tween ideas, social relations, and material elements, a glance toward known adaptive- evolutionary tendencies of cultures-all of these are absent. "Sociological aspects of</page><page sequence="4">[64, 1962] 1066 A merican Anthropologist economic growth" to Hoselitz, as to many other economists, appear as behavioral tendencies, values, role expectations, or "character orientations" of people in given social-cultural orders. When Hoselitz's discussion seeks to move beyond supply and demand it founders, as in the good economic tradition, on social-psychological shoals. Perhaps this helps explain certain of Hoselitz's propositions that are otherwise curious to a cultural-anthropological mentality. For example: governments of under- developed countries are resolved to induce industrial growth; hence, "economic fac- tors" such as the accumulation of capital can be viewed as "primary variables" in the process of development, whereas social structure will have only a modifying influence in response to the economic "stimuli"-this in contrast to the industrialization of the West which was "an overall social process in which, a priori no causal primacy can be assigned to any one set of variables" (p. 43). It seems grotesque to argue the passive dependence of "social structure" when the formation of strong national governments precedes-and in the present circumstances of underdeveloped countries is a necessary condition for-industrialization. What exactly is Hoselitz's idea of the relation between "social structure" (be- havioral propensities) and economic development? If on one page "no causal primacy" can be assigned a priori to any set of variables involved in the historic economic advance of the West, still on the next page "cultural and social-structural variables may be assumed to have created the conditions for economic change" in the West (p. 44). In the same essay, certain behavioral modes are posited as the "basic sociological foundation" of present differences between economically advanced and underdeveloped countries (p. 29); as "the determinants, on the most generalized level of socially relevant be- havior, of average real output of a society" (p. 30); as "social-structural foundation of the contrast between an economically advanced and underdeveloped society" (p. 34); and as "the primary social determinants of economic progress" (p. 42). Yet, because governments of underdeveloped countries are planning for growth (i.e., the argument reviewed above), the "impact of social and cultural factors consists . . . not in de- termining whether or not, or even in what form, economic growth is to take place, but how easily and smoothly . . ." (p. 43). On the other hand, if one looks at the examples of India and Russia, the "very needs of economic advancement" which engender planned industrialization will also engender the required behavioral modes (social structure) (pp. 47-49). The first sentence of the next essay speaks of "the mutual dependence between changes in economic activity and in social structure" (p. 53). Let's take a concrete case. Hoselitz, in viewing the erection of protectionist barriers against American grain exports in France and Germany in the late 1870's, wonders why so many people favored such a policy. His answer, barely translating the question, is circular: I believe that the atmosphere prevailing in each of these two countries which were engaged in dominant growth [i.e. autarchy] induced representatives of the most varied political and ideo- logical persuasions to favour a pattern of simultaneous vigorous development of all branches of productive activity.... In other words, the general orientation prevailing with respect to devel- oping the country's resources tended to favour a high degree of self-sufficiency ... (p. 97). But even an explanation that depends on the "atmosphere prevailing" or the "general orientation" may be preferable to a thesis like this one: urbanization is re- quired for economic development because, among other things, it gives impetus to use of mass communication media, mass communication in turn stimulates empathy, and "this heightened capacity for empathy is an important socio-psychological determinant of innovating behavior, and hence of economic development" (p. 238).</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 1067 It has been said by many critics, most convincingly perhaps by Gunnar Myrdal (1957), that Western development-economists are analytically emasculated by certain "predilections" stemming from classical economics, ultimately from the objective economic conditions of 18th and 19th century Europe. Devoted in the beginning not merely to the analysis of the market but to the antistate-antiorganization doctrine of the Invisible Hand, the business of economics has typically been business. Reflecting the disengagement of the market from society at large was the notable intellectual dis- tinction between "economic factors." Things directly involved in establishment of pecuniary value under ideal-desirable conditions of the free market, and "exogenous factors" amounting to the structure and evolutionary tendencies of culture in general and of those aspects in particular that are not properly in the pecuniary arena. Now modern events have subjected classical economic theory to pressure at its weakest point: its patent inability to free itself from specific historic conditions, to suggest com- parative and developmental generalizations. This weakness in the received wisdom often impresses itself on economists as an unfortunate failure to consider the "exog- enous factors." Thus the dramatic drift into eclecticism of development economics, the new concern for "sociological aspects." Yet the casting away from classical theoretical constraints immediately runs aground on another old predilection: behavioristic ex- planations founded, in the final analysis, on certain assumed propensities of indi- viduals. To examine the latter predilection I am going to (again) depart somewhat from the Hoselitz essays; or rather, I am using the essays to raise certain issues of comparative economic study. Actually the issues transcend economics. In broad terms, the individ- ual-behaviorist perspective stands opposed to the view of cultural systems operating sui generis according to functional relations between objective properties of their ele- ments. So considered, the predisposition for individual-behaviorist views is not con- fined to the study of economy but appears in analyses of many aspects of culture, and it is not unique to economics but reigns throughout social science. In anthropology it emerges, in a sophisticated form, as one side of the ethnological controversy of "culturo- logical versus psychological determinants." More subtly it pervades certain ethno- graphic approaches, such as the individualistic approach to property, or egocentric de- pictions of kinship "systems." The culturological side, incidentally, has sometimes castigated individualism-behaviorism as the survival of age old anthropomorphism. Yet, as an explanation of its late florescence, as well as of its uneven persistence, this is insufficient. Why does the individualist bias tenaciously attend considerations of cer- tain sectors of culture and not others, or why does it run through non-Marxist social science, while in Marxist writing the cultural outlook is often a matter of course. and premise? To prevent possible misunderstanding, a word. I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class-relations and class-interests. My stand- point, from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them. (This is from the preface of the first edition of Capital, Karl Marx, p. 15 of the Modern Library Edition, New York, n.d. On some aspects of the affinity between culturology and Marxism-where, however, the relation between the two is mistakenly argued-see "Cultural Evolution, Southern Athapaskans, and Chronology in Theory," by Morris E. Opler, Southwestern Journal of Anthropology 17, 1961).</page><page sequence="6">A merican A nthropologist [64, 1962] 1068 The underlying social basis of individualism in western social science thought should be explored and discussed-by a professional sociologist of knowledge. To this amateur the growth of a culturological perspective together with an anticapitalist protest sug- gests that the opposing scholarly predilection for individual-behaviorism is a natural offspring of the free market, step-brother to the atomistic, antiorganization dogma of the liberal movement. To return to the more restricted issue: an imposing edifice of formal economic analy- sis has been erected on the classical footings of assumed propensities of individuals to truck and barter, to economize. Such propensities continue to be evoked, implicitly or explicitly, in economistic explanations without stipulating the cultural-historical con- ditions determining their relevance and their presumed effects. When the postulate is carried over into the explanation of economic variation, serious difficulties are en- countered, and further crippling predilections are likely to develop if it is not then abandoned. It seems reasonable to suppose that a tendency to seek the most profitable alterna- tive, to gainfully deploy goods and efforts against material returns, is universal. (That economizing in this sense exists in primitive societies, at least in certain contexts, I think can be argued empirically, also from the nature of production and social organiza- tion, and on the logical ground that survival requires some measure of economic ration- ality.) But it is another and unwarranted supposition that the economic process is everywhere organized by, and therefore is explicable by, individual economizing-that places and methods of production, levels and types of output, dispositions of "factors" and finished goods are direct expressions of economizing. Working a kinsman's garden, cultivating land within the domain of one's lineage, or surrendering half of a yam har- vest to a sister's household, do not result from free play of the labor, land, or goods of society against prevailing demands. Between any economizing propensities of individ- uals and the economic process is a powerful third term: social, political, ideological-in brief, cultural-elements that order the latter and constrain the former. (It is not necessary to insist that men in nonmarket economics are innocent of gain- ful motive. But clearly any such motives would have to be consummated within an existing economic framework built of social-political relations-some of which such as close kinship require exchanges of goods even as they presume the immorality of gain. Perhaps a hunter does share a kill with his father-in-law with an eye to material re- wards: he hopes to get what he wants by laying on obligations of reciprocity. Still the goods flow was constrained by prevailing social relations and ethics and would be un- predictable from market-scarcity conditions. Or perhaps-typically it would not happen-the hunter bypasses a hungry brother to share game with an equally hungry distant kinsman, a person who would be obligated to reciprocate more quickly, some- times more generously. The economizing remains within the rules of the game, i.e., the rule of greater balance and directness of reciprocity in proportion to kinship distance. Economizing is not itself the rules of the game.) Unconsciously and without proper justification I argue from an equation of "econ- omizing" with "gain." Let us rather limit "economizing" to rational dispositions of goods and efforts, thus implying maximization of return but not necessarily "gain" or "profit," which is a particular historical species of maximization. Again such "econ- omizing" may be presumed universal; without argument it is universal if "return" is not stipulated in some material sense. But the economic course dictated by rationaliza- tion in one set of cultural circumstances is not called for in another. The intensification of agricultural production which might be the apotheosis of reason in the context of market economy, for example, would often be for the feudal serf, given the prescribed</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 1069 rights and obligations, the height of folly. If individual behavior in all cases tends to- ward derivation of the most possible satisfaction from the least possible expenditure, still dispositions of goods and efforts-what, in fact, is rational-vary with objective cultural conditions. The course of wisdom now would be to abandon the explanatory perspective of the individual in favor of study of the cultural qualities determining the economic issue. The practical course of the received wisdom, however, is different: it is to assign pecuniary-like "values" to these cultural qualities. That is to say, cultural forces and structures are equated with the hierarchy of attitudes that attend them. In analyses of nonmarket economies (or of tendencies in market economies not spontaneously arising in the market sector), nonmaterialistic considerations that govern dispositions are transliterated into "values" so that they may be presumed subject to businesslike economizing by individuals. The fundamental classical-formal assumptions are pre- served. The explanation can now proceed in the received form of business-as-usual. One predictable outcome is the tautology lurking in the background of much formal analysis of economic variation: they do not work because of the "comparatively greater value" in psychological security to be gained from the unproductive religious rite; a man gives goods for nothing to his brother (son, cross cousin, father, etc.) be- cause he values social over material returns; and so forth. Thus the search by economic comparativists for "exogenous factors" amounts not to abandonment of the market mentality but to affirmation of its universal validity. It is a search for alternative propensities or "values," a way of pricing cultural facts which, while irrational from market perspectives, can be substituted in the conventional economizing formula to cover results that do not conform to conventional expectations. The "exogenous fac- tors" appear as the ex post facto pecuniary assignments demanded by the unshakable initial premise. (So we see Hoselitz, when breaking with the classical predilection to ignore "non-economic factors," exchanging it, in his idea of "social structure," for such coin-with notably unsuccessful results.) There is a further broad implication of the propensity to price "exogenous factors," to speak of them as "values" instead of in terms of their own describable qualities, that deserves to be made explicit. The logical outcome, even if it seems a reduction to absurdity, is commitment to the outlook that all of culture is in the market, that cul- ture is organized by and for the purpose of satisfying individual wants, and that culture change is governed by economizing to the end of peoples' satisfactions. If the relevance of "exogenous factors"-the structure of society, ideology, etc.-is their "values" the notion that people economize material means is generalized to the notion that they economize all cultural means. The market principle reigns over culture at large and in its entirety. The directive force of culture change is the economizing of individuals, and the influence of cultural elements, coming into account as "values," depends on pecuniary-like considerations of costs and sacrifices, scarcities and alternative gains, supplies and demands. Culture is business on the societal scale. How much current social science thought thus refracts objective social-cultural conditions through the prism of a market mentality? Is not this disposition of mind fundamental to the broad emphasis on "value" studies that runs through our social sciences, and that in turn is specially capitalized by development economics? Is it not unfortunate, in any event, that the progress of the backward areas, which perhaps more obviously than any other development in history occurs in direct proportion to the repression of personal satisfactions, should be approached with a predisposition for explanations in terms of individual inclinations? And what are the specific results? Professor Hoselitz, combining broad knowledge on</page><page sequence="8">1070 A merican Anthropologist the economic side with awareness of the latest social science trends, reaches several conclusions, including policy recommendations, about the underdeveloped world. Many of his opinions are of theoretical interest, if only because they are more or less widely shared by development-economists. The case for small private enterprise is singled out for special consideration here because it highlights the several weaknesses of the eclectic drift. First, there is the typical deflection from critical cultural issues. In the principal essay arguing the desirability of private entrepreneurship (Chapter 6), Hoselitz reasons initially that it much (or all) depends on the extent of the countervailing public sector. But the specific historical conditions governing the prominence of that sector in under- developed nations are not subjected to further scrutiny. In the end Hoselitz is pessi- mistic about private development, not because of the scale and kind of industrial in- vestment required today in less advanced regions, or of other similar considerations, but because he doubts that social-cultural factors evoking a suitable "character orienta- tion" -i.e., a "predominant productive orientation"-are to be had in presently back- ward countries. Similarly, the recommendation that small private enterprise be encouraged had un- folded from social-psychological argument. The question posed was which type of economic leadership might and should prevail, managerial or entrepreneurial? Moral- political (not economic) considerations make the latter preferable, inasmuch as the likely managerial type in an underdeveloped country would approximate the in- humane Russian industrial bureaucratic. The Russian manager is briefly caricatured: efficient but brutal, operating with "no regard for human feelings and emotions," regardless also "of the cost in human lives and satisfactions," Russian managers drive "their workers often to exhaustion" (pp. 145-46). A contrast with American man- agers-apparently more humane-is sketchily presented. Evidently, the contrast is drawn in order to link managerial brutality with lower levels of industrialization and to suggest its likelihood in underdeveloped countries. For, in Hoselitz's view, an im- portant reason behind the different propensities of Russian and American managers is: the different level of economic development in the two countries. For, in our society, human life and next to it personal security, in an economic, but even in an emotional sense, are values of high priorities, whereas in underdeveloped countries [Russia?], life is cheap and human happiness of lile concern. Such differences in values become internalized and thus part and parcel of typical behavior patterns associated with particular roles in a given society (p. 146; my emphasis). Managers, of course, would govern public enterprise or any large-scale private enter- prise. In underdeveloped countries, according to Hoselitz, they would be brutal. He concludes, therefore: "from the point of view of human welfare economic development in the form of privately owned small and medium sized plants is preferable to that based chiefly on large public enterprises" (p. 149). Hoselitz admits that private enter- prise has not been historically notable for its compassion for the underlying population, but argues that all underdeveloped countries now have labor laws which would inhibit duplication of the "excesses" of the 19th century industrial revolution (p. 149). And while he acknowledges that independent underdeveloped countries (having emerged from long periods of foreign domination and economic stagnation) seem committed in national principle to the elimination of human misery and abject subservience, still, he says, the new upper classes are prepared to manipulate the masses as the foreigners once did, and "life is still cheap" (pp. 147-48). This case for private enterprise is surrounded by materials which, weakening it at critical points, rob it of conviction. Regarding entrepreneurial compassion, Hoselitz had [64, 19621</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 1071 earlier written that social welfare legislation in less developed countries is often sub- verted, and that "the principal spokesmen for the nonapplicability of many forms of social welfare legislation in underdeveloped countries are members of the business elite . . ." (p. 40). Pertinent to the desirability of small business is Hoselitz's vision of the status of workers in the mass of small private industries which he advocates, in still another essay, for Asia in particular. Japan is to be the "model" for Asia in this regard. Yet Japanese workers in smaller shops, which are technically less efficient than the larger industries, receive about three-fifths the wages of their fellows in the greater plants-this in a "country in which technological change has already progressed far, and in which many technical and organizational innovations have been introduced also in small-scale industry" (p. 129). The wage differential is here maintained by impeding labor mobility through adaptation of traditional paternalistic relations to the employer- employee relation. Hoselitz foresees that elsewhere in Asia workers in smaller plants, because of the technical limitations of business scale, would be likewise endowed with low productivity and hence [receive] lower than average wages. In the absence of totalitarian controls, it is likely that in these countries also certain informal institutions impeding the free mobility of labour, from small to large industry, will be instituted .... In a country like India, for example, there are other survivals of socio-structural arrangements, foremost the caste system, which are eminently adaptable to prevent a high degree of social mobility (p. 134; my emphasis). In brief, Asian workers suffer economically to the extent Hoselitz's recommendations for small private plants-preferable "from the point of view of human welfare"-are implemented. This is the fault of the business scale and of its orientation towards profits, not the return to skill and effort. The caste system in India, or similar institu- tions elsewhere, are to be retained in the degree necessary to obstruct formation of a free labor market-and inevitably also to inhibit organized protest. Hoselitz goes on to envision that the industrial outcome for Asia hinges importantly on "survivals" of such institutions as caste systems, suitably adapted to businesslike production. Myrdal has remarked (1957:102) that the bulk of current scholarly discussions about economic progress in underdeveloped countries "does not take its starting point from the interests of the underdeveloped countries themselves but, consciously or un- consciously, views their problems from the national political interests of one of the ad- vanced countries or a group of them." Also to be considered are the barriers to understanding imposed by arguments from moral principle. If one argues for private enterprise from considerations of human wel- fare, it becomes unnecessary to make an economic case for it, and Hoselitz does not do so. It would appear that the moral argument is anyhow historically irrelevant-what- ever beneficial results private enterprise has had in the past, its implementation in the present on a base of underpaid workers kept in check by survivals of a caste system would not, except perhaps for an industrial brahmin, speak in its favor. And while we are being impelled along a line of economic reason suggested by historically irrelevant premises, the same premises make irrelevant the historically critical economic considera- tions. It is irrelevant and unnecessary (in this context) to make economic comparisons with other roads to industrialization, to compare growth rates with other economic courses, to consider deeply the consequences for a backward country of a growth rate that fails to close the international gap. The omission of the economic question is a serious thing, all the more so because there is reason to suspect that its inclusion would embarrass the argument for smallish private enterprise. A body of responsible opinion holds that total "socialist construction" has decided economic advantages over mixed (public-private) development for presently backward nations. More important, there</page><page sequence="10">1072 A merican A nthropologist [64, 1962] is evidence for this, and the same evidence, incidentally, suggests that future his- torians-enviably relieved by time from the moral responsibilities of the position-are more likely to see in Communist China than in Japan the "model" of 20th century industrialization (see: "India and China: Contrasts in Development Performance," American Economic Review 49:284-309, 1959, by Wilfred Malenbaum; pp. 725-28 of Economic Development, by Benjamin Higgins, New York, W. W. Norton, 1959; The Future as History, by Robert L. Heilbroner, New York, Harper and Bros., 1960; and some of the economic difficulties nurtured by the encouragement of small-scale private industry, especially consumer goods industry, may be judged from, among others, Baran 1957:286 et passim; "Notes on the Government of India's First Five Year Plan," Economic Development and Cultural Change 1:57-72, 1951, by D. R. Gagdil; "The Role of Cottage and Small-Scale Industries in Asian Economic Development," Economic Development and Cultural Change 4:356-70, 1956, by Theodore Herman; "Cottage Industries: A Comment," Economic Development and Cultural Change 5: 371-73, 1957, by J. J. Spengler; etc.). This leads us back to the eye-catching aspect of Hoselitz's case for the private entre- preneur: "life is cheap [in the Orient]." That "life is cheap" seems beneath the level of serious explanation of the totalitarian drift in the underdeveloped world. (Arguing from the nature of the beast and of culture, life must be dear in any functioning society, at least to its possessors, in most contexts.) Let us agree that an effective in- dustrial development in backward areas may-more likely, must-occur in an atmos- phere of economic and political oppression. But is it because "life is cheap and human happiness of little concern?" Or because development begins from a world position of industrial primitiveness and proceeds against counter currents of competition and potential imposition by already developed nations? World-historical conditions select positively for despotic organization in underdeveloped countries. Those disposed by structural potential and historical possibility for this course have the best chance to quit the sluggish tributaries for the main stream of industrial progress. Chances for economic success are typically improved where certain severe measures can be carried through: confiscation of foreign holdings, liquidation of comprador and preindustrial upper classes of the old regime and appropriation of the wealth they have locked up, elimination of small-scale holdings and neolithic relations in the countryside, the un- remitting accumulation of heavy-industrial producer goods ("capital") to the com- parative neglect of consumer goods and at the expense of supreme efforts by the under- lying population, and the like. A propensity for this sort of action is not social-psycho- logical-it is functional! (cf. Heilbroner 1960: 82). It is at the least unseemly for us, the more fortunate, to question on moral or on cultural-relativist grounds whether some sacrifice in industrial progress is not worth the gain in human welfare-as if it were a matter of business choice. And it is unrealistic also to suppose that history is constrained by such moral principles. Other considera- tions are more likely to be decisive. In present circumstances, other paths to industrial- ism are not as advantageous economically. Certainly everyone hopes these circum- stances will soon pass away, but the greater hope looks to be a long term one. It is the hope in the paradox that it is now impossible (pace Hoselitz)-as it had been in the colonial past under racism and creeds of that ilk-to undertake economic reorganiza- tion frankly sanctioned by neglect of human happiness. The present is in revolt against the past, against the images of bondage. True the revolt is activated, even brutally dictated, from above. But the historic impact of the foreign dominance inflicted on the</page><page sequence="11">1073 Book Reviews previously passive masses of Asia, Africa, and Latin America inevitably requires that their activated reaction-where it can prevail-be sustained by an ideological dedica- tion to human welfare. In parallel discussions, to which this one is much in debt, Isaac Deutscher (Russia in Transition, New York, Coward-McCann, 1957; Stalin: A Political Biography, New York, Vintage Books, 1960) remarks that "there can be no spectacle as disgusting as a post-revolutionary tyranny dressed up in the banners of liberty." Yet the necessity to raise these banners-long may they wave!-promises they will still be gallantly streaming on the day after tomorrow, when the draconic tyranny shall have exhausted its historic function. Volkskultur in der technischen Welt. HERMANN BAUSINGER. Stuttgart: W. Kohlhammer Verlag, 1961. 224 pp. DM 14.80. Reviewed by CHARLES H. LANGE, Southern Illinois University In Peasant Society and Culture (1956:19), Robert Redfield, writing primarily from an appraisal of his own country, noted that "Until recently the peasantry of the Old World were the business, not of anthropology, but of other disciplines .... Folklore and the study of folk life (peasant life) were distinguished from the anthropologist's or ethnologist's study of primitive life (Volkskunde versus Volkerkunde). The student of peasant life characteristically did not make holistic community studies ..." In com- menting upon my earlier citation (and implicit endorsement) of Redfield's point (AMvERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST 59: 1067), Ethel Boissevain very correctly noted that this lack of common interest could not properly be ascribed to Europeans, citing E. B. Tylor and Sir James Frazer as examples to support her view (AMERICAN ANTHROPOLO- GIST 60: 1186). Further evidence, if there is need, is readily at hand in the literature or is indicated on a more recent level in such summaries of anthropological activities and interests as those presented for various European countries in the International Direc- tory of Anthropological Institutions (1953). In addition to the bibliographic items cited by Redfield, it is interesting to note that the concern with folk, or peasant, cultures has continued through the years since he made his remarks. Thus, Professor Bausinger's discussion should find a receptive audience among anthropologists, not only in Europe but in this country as well. Bausinger, recently named Director of the Ludwig Uhland Institut fur Volkskunde at the University of Tuibingen, has relied primarily on examples from the folk culture(s) of his native southwest Germay. Limited data from elsewhere in Germany and Europe (Swabian colonies in the Lower Danube Valley, for example), as well as from the ethnographic world-at-large, have also been utilized. This broader view, restricted as it is in richness of detail, nonetheless serves to indicate Bausinger's approach. As anthropologists have often pondered the universal qualities of their findings within specific cultural entities, Bausinger is concerned with the general characteristics of folk culture, with the nature of processes in cultural dynamics, with cultural values which serve as a framework or context within which these dynamics occur, and with the common problems which confront such folk cultures, as the world around them moves inevitably toward increasing involvement with technology. He is also interested in the nature of this technological world to which cultural adjustments must be made. The introduction briefly discusses the concepts of "folk" and "population." The ideas of Herder and the romanticists are noted as an historical base. Of greater sig- nificance, however, in the development of the science of folklore, was the work of</page></plain_text>
