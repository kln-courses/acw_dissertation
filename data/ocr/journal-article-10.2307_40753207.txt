<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel: Interpretations of Durkheim's Classifications Maureen Bloom This paper deals almost exclusively with the texts of the Pentateuch - the first five books of the Bible, known as Chamisha Chum 'shei Torah - the five books of the Law, or of Moses. They tell the story of the birth of the Israelite people, and incorporate their creation myth and a general his- tory. This includes a period of slavery in Egypt and the story of the exodus from Egypt and entry into the land of Canaan. The five books describe a people bound to a god who has set aside for them a holy land. The god is invisible and omnipotent but is particularly associated with the land of Canaan: "And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and settlers with me." (Leviti- cus 25:23). He will allow the people to live in this land only as a holy people, obeying His laws and performing purification rites to sustain a state of holiness. The god himself is the source of this holiness and, being holy, expects the people to be holy too.1 Holiness is attained through the maintenance of a system of categorization and separation. Certain things are holy (or proscribed), others are polluting, and certain acts are required to restore a polluted person to a state of clean-ness, which is part of being holy. The body itself is the central point of refer- ence, rules clustering around the foods eaten, the clothes worn, and the ritual actions that the body must perform. A system of reward and punishment governs bodily practices and moral choices. An intricate pattern of feast days and sacrifices is inter- woven into the daily lives of the people, who have to keep a balance of personal holiness by adhering to personal purification rituals combined with animal sacrifices. Atonement for sins also involves animal sacrifice. These sacrifices are carried out in a sanctuary, by members of a priestly 1 Leviticus 19: 1: You shall be holy, because I, the Lord your God am Holy.

Provision is made for individual and communal purification, atonement and punishment. This central dialectic of holiness, sacredness and separation recalls the terms in which Durkheim wrote about religion. Mestrovic (1994) has written that: "From dropping the David in David Emile Durkheim's name to the relentless efforts to make him seem Franco-Christian and Parsonian, Durkheim's Jewish heritage and the influence of that heri- tage upon his sociology is being denied." Durkheim's ideas about reli- gion were rooted in his intimate understanding of Judaism; I shall argue, more specifically, that his theory provides a particularly good analytical account of Judaism, if of no other religion. I shall also show that many later Durkheimians - including such contemporary anthropologists as Douglas (1966) and Lewis (1987) - have unduly simplified his central antithesis, while Durkheim himself offered an accurate and subtle ac- count of the ambiguous Biblical concept of the sacred. David Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) was born in the Vosges, France, the son, grandson and great-grandson of Rabbis. "He grew up within the confines of a close-knit, orthodox and traditional Jewish family . . . and was destined for the rabbinate and his early education was directed to that end: he studied for a time at a rabbinical school. Yet he soon decided, while still a schoolboy, not to follow the family tradition."2 He was always conscious of his Jewish origin and came to political maturity in the wake of France's defeat by Prussia that unleashed an anti-semitic campaign, most notable for the prosecution of Dreyfus. "[Anti-Semitism] had already been seen in the regions of the East at the time of the war of 1870; being myself of Jewish origin, I was then able to observe it at close hand. The Jews were blamed for defeats."3 Jones (1993:40 - cited by Mestrovic 1994) writes that the rabbinic tradi- tion in Alsace ensured that "religion was synonymous with a community of shared moral beliefs and legal practices." Webber (1992:265) argues that, in a contemporary setting, "The term 'orthodox' as used in France, for example, does not necessarily mean the same thing as it does in England. The series of terms, and the respective identities to which they allude, thus also function in a structural manner - that is, in relation to each other, within the local sub-system." Webber points to the self-evident notion that ideas about Jews and Jew- ish identity cannot be uniform, nor can "repertoires of ritual" remain static in time or space. What remain unchanged, however, are the text 2 Lukes, p. 39. 3 Lukes, p. 41.</page><page sequence="3">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 105 and the ideas underlying the laws. Cooper's argument (1987:70) for the Talmudic commentaries to the Torah may be extended to cover Torah Law itself: "The text itself is immutable, but changes in textual interpre- tation reflect different sets of cultural rules." Although Durkheim followed the ideological path of the positivist generation of great Republican academics, his approach to the analysis of religion seems, upon closer scrutiny, to have been strongly influenced by his Jewish background. But there was another, more immediate sti- mulus: his reading of Robertson Smith's great work on the ancient Semi- tic religions. The impact of his reading of Robertson Smith was empha- sized by Durkheim:4 "... it was not until 1895 that I achieved a clear view of the essential role played by religion in social life ... all my previous researches had to be taken up afresh in order to be made to harmonize with these new insights . . . [This re-orientation] was entirely due to the studies of religious history which I had just undertaken, and notably to the reading of Robertson Smith and his school." The religious system of archaic societies became a privileged topic of research for him. He saw religious experience - mainly rooted in the performance of ritual - as an experience of reality and not one of self- or communal-delusion. This reality at the heart of ritual is revealed to be society itself. Rites effect a communion between the members of a group. The power of Robertson Smith's account of Semitic religions was surely in part that it translated into objective language the central theological ideas with which Durkheim was so familiar. Durkheim was reluctant to make comparisons between civilized peo- ples and religions, and primitive tribes and cults. "This is why the religion of Israel fell outside the purview of anthropolo- gical inquiry. Although it retained survivals from a primitive past, Israelite religion had largely transcended and thus obscured its primitive origins."5 My thesis, however, will be that consciously or not, influenced by his own background, an influence reinforced by his reading of Robertson Smith's work on Semitic religions, Durkheim developed his theory of religion in the idiom of Judaism; and that therefore it is perhaps pecu- liarly fitted to the analysis of Judaism. At the heart of Durkheim' s analysis is a dichotomy between the "sacred" and the "profane." There was 4 Lukes, p. 237. Eilberg-Schwartz, p. 19</page><page sequence="4">106 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 "a bipartite division of the whole universe, known and knowable into two classes which embrace all that exists, but which radically exclude each other ... Religious beliefs are the représentations which express the nature of sacred things and the relationships which they sustain, either with each other or with profane things."6 Cooper (1987:72, note 6) writes: "I consider sacred/profane to be an opposition, and view the profane to be diametrically opposed to the sacred. I therefore assume the existence of a cultural-religious category of everyday things, which are neither sacred nor profane. This may be a departure from the original formulation of sacred/ profane found in Durkheim (1965, 52), but I find this departure necessary for dealing with the present material." Although my analysis will challenge the sacred/profane opposition, it is in this "departure" that the basis of my argument for much of this paper lies. Whereas other, pantheistic, religions in the Land of Canaan envisage gods representing entities in nature, or male and female deities uniting in a procreative process guaranteeing, for example, good harvests, the Is- raelite God is "set apart" from all other gods - qadosh.7 Douglas8 states that "The God of Israel is the God of life, all the other gods are dead;" dead they may be in Douglas' view, but nevertheless they are wor- shipped continually by the inhabitants of Canaan, and remain tempting to the Israelites always. Eilberg-Schwartz asserts that "the Israelite God did not have other gods with whom to interact,"9 reflecting the accepted monotheistic view of traditional Judaism. On the contrary, there are many gods, but one is the true, holy God, set apart. Separation of the part from the whole is intrinsic to the nature of qadosh. Durkheim re- cognized this characteristic of the sacred - that it is something set apart from all else. In the same way as the God of the Hebrews has separated himself from "other gods," so, by its daily behaviour, must the holy people se- parate itself from the other nations surrounding it. Durkheim, using a Greek phrase - homoiosis to theo - describes the state of being made the same as the god. By doing what the god/totem does - in this instance, being qadosh - you become like the god.10 If the Israelites perform all the correct rituals and obey all the command- 6 Lukes, pp. 24-5.

Priests (Kohanim) from the priestly tribe (Levites) were the facilitators of purification rites and their role in the Tent of Meeting enabled people to become "pure" and therefore "qadosh." The priests were forbidden, on pain of death, to drink wine or strong drink before entering the Tent of Meeting. The instruction is: "that you may put difference between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean" - ben ha- qadosh u'ven ha-chol, u'ven ha-tameh u'ven ha-tahor.n The clear inference is that the mind could be clouded by the effects of alcohol and confusion would be the outcome. The injunction provides the key to the crucial requirement of vigilance regarding purity and pollution which is central to ancient Judaism. Above all, holiness is equated with separateness from profane, every- day life. Durkheim defines the sacred thus: "Sacred beings are separated beings. That which characterizes them is that there is a break of continuity between them and the profane beings . . . A whole group of rites has the object of realizing this state of separation which is essential. Since their function is to prevent undue mixings and to keep one of these two domains from encroaching upon the other, they are only able to impose abstentions or negative acts."12 The creation of the natural environment described in Genesis involves the separation of several elements: light from darkness, sky from sea, sea from land, evening from morning, sun from moon and stars. These se- parations are described using the verb le-hav'dil - to divide. When six days have elapsed, the seventh day is qadosh because it is so different from the previous six, and the following six; the acts of creativity have ceased. When the mundanity of the week-day as opposed to the Sabbath or an "appointed time" is described, the word chol is used. This is "com- mon" time versus time that has been "set apart." The word chol, also has the implication of profanation - chillul ha-shem is profanation of God's holy name. The term chol can thus be read as an opposition to qadosh] it encapsulates the concepts of both the mundanity of the secu- lar or the blasphemy of the profane. Somewhere in-between are the in- termediate days of an "appointed time," chol ha-mo 'ed - where the first and seventh days of a feast, such as Passover, are qadosh, but the inter- vening days are not, yet they are still set apart by being incorporated within the appointed time of the festival. 11 Leviticus 10:10. 12 Durkheim, p. 299.</page><page sequence="6">108 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 Although qadosh is often translated as "holy," there is the further and specific implication that the holy object is "cut off" or "set apart" from other objects. This state of separation may indicate not only states of sanctity, but also prohibition and profanity. One of the punishments for disobedience to God is karet - cutting off. The threat of "cutting off" is the mirror image of the state of holiness - the cut-off-person is not holy, has rendered him or herself profane by his or her own actions, and activates the opposite state of qadosh. Being karet implies not merely excommunication, although there is a sense of that state in the threat; karet means being cut off from the community and the people as a whole, and implies childlessness and/or early death. Exclusion from communal life and failure to reproduce are circumstances clearly asso- ciated with social life and social "death," as described by Smith.13 "One of the greatest services which Robertson Smith has rendered to the science of religions," Durkheim remarked, "is to have pointed out the ambiguity of the notion of sacredness."14 This particular idea of qadosh does not operate on the basis of a simple dichotomy between sacred and profane. The very same term, qadosh, can mean "to sanctify, consecrate, dedicate, purify, or keep pure," or is used to indicate some- thing which becomes prohibited. For example, a person who is cut off, separated from normal society is the Qadesh (m) or Q'desha (f), the sodomite, or temple prostitute; the thing that has been separated is not holy, but profane.15 Also, the act of sowing seeds of plants other than the vine within the confines of a vineyard, or planting vines among seeds of a different species, renders those seeds and vines condemned - qadosh}6 There are many other prohibitions on what Durkheim called "undue mixing," though these do not result in a person or thing becoming qadosh. There is the prohibition against ploughing with an ox and an ass harnessed together, which follows the injunction on the sowing of mixed seed.17 Cross-breeding between species is forbidden.18 There is a prohibition against wearing clothing of mixed fabric - cotton may not be woven with linen, or wool with flax, for example, (sha'atnez - Levi- ticus 19:19). The significance of clothing is further evident in the prohi- bition against cross-dressing by both sexes,19 while the laundering of 13 Smith, p. 60. 14 Durkheim, p. 409. 13 Deuteronomy 23:18. 16 Deuteronomy 22:9.

Related to this idea that a god, a person, a time or a thing that is separated can be both sacred and profane, is the cher em. The word can mean "excommunicated," or "banned;" but it also carries the im- plication of something that has been "dedicated," that is, set aside for priestly or sacred use. There is also an intimation of its extreme opposite - "doomed to destruction." Both people and things can be under a cherem, in which case they are proscribed. But a person, beast or field may be devoted to God, and called cherem, in which case it becomes qodesh qodashim - "holy of holies" - and can never be redeemed or sold.20 Tahor and Tameh21 It is not enough to recognise the ambiguity of the notion of qadosh. It must also be distinguished from the notions of purity and pollution. Tahor means "clean, pure, not subject or susceptible to levitical un- cleanness;" a fish, a bird, a domestic animal that is tahor may be eaten. There is also a sense of "to be bright, to glitter." It can also be used in the sense of "to purify, to make (levitically) clean, to absolve from sin, to be cleansed, to cleanse oneself." Tameh means "to be filled up, inacces- sible, forbidden, levitically impure." It can also mean "to be unclean, to make unclean, soil, defile, or to be made unclean;" the latter as in "to make oneself unclean by handling a corpse." In the category of tameh fall the menstruant, the giver and receiver of seminal fluid in sexual intercourse and the person who has had contact with a corpse. Both people and objects can be contaminated or polluted by contact with the tameh.12 Niddah23 indicates isolation or a condition of uncleanness. 20 Leviticus 27:28. The concept of niddah is also pertinent here, but the meaning is sometimes ob- scure. 22 The notion of contiguity generates two possibilities - Durkheim, p. 356: (i) "any- thing touching an object also touches everything which has any relation of proximity or unity whatsoever with this object." The idea of contagion is inherent in some forms of ritual pollution, (ii) "like produces like" - "The representation of a being or condition produces this being or condition." This is the idea behind animal sacrifice, where the polluted person brings a sacrificial offering to the priest, and lays hands upon the head of the beast before the animal is slaughtered. Numbers 19:20-23. The word is also found in the phrase "the water of sprinkling" which describes the purification ceremony after contact with a corpse. The text would</page><page sequence="8">1 10 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 In the period shortly after childbirth and during menstruation a woman is niddah. She is both isolated and unclean, unapproachable by her hus- band until she has been cleansed or purified. Unlike most of his commentators, Durkheim was well aware that the "sacred" may be holy or impure: "There are two sorts of sacredness, the propitious and the impropitious, and not only is there no break of continuity between these two opposed forms, but also one object may pass from the one to the other without changing its nature. The pure is made out of the impure, and reciprocally It is in the possibility of these transmutations that the ambiguity of the sacred consists."24 In the same way that a particular person can move from a state of pollution to one of purity by means of ritual, so, too, can the Land of Canaan. The transmutation of an area of land from a state of pollution to a purified territory relies on this ambiguity - the land remains the same in essence; behaviour patterns change, and in the minds of the inhabitants, the character of the place is thus altered and sanctified. The laws of qadosh and tameh in these texts must have been ingrained in Durkheim's "ethno-consciousness," his own "collective representa- tions." Sociological commentators like Pickering, however, are inclined rather to consider the "sacred" as "an irreducible entity."25 Pickering26 claims that "Durkheim did not see the sacred as an isolated concept . . . for the sacred is to be understood, and only has meaning, by reason of its opposite, the profane. The sacred stands as one element in a dichot- omous or binary system." Douglas27 makes a similar error, allowing these states to become intertwined when she writes: "To be holy is to be whole, to be one; holiness is unity, integrity, perfection of the indivi- dual and of the kind. The dietary rules merely develop the metaphor of holiness on the same lines." This is a major misunderstanding of Dur- kheim as well as Smith, who also treated sacred and profane as two sides of the same coin, as it were. For Durkheim, both sacred and profane, and "the pure and the impure are not two separate classes, but two varieties of the same class."28 Lukes29 also addresses a more subtle problem: appear to indicate "water of isolation," thus indicating the nature of this water and the unclean state which is reversed by its use. 24 Durkheim, p. 411. 25 Pickerinz, p. 115. 26 Pickering, p. 117. 27 Douglas 1966, p. 54. 28 Durkheim, p. 411. 29 Lukes, p. 27.</page><page sequence="9">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 111 "It is difficult to see how the dichotomy between sacred and profane can be reconciled with Durkheim's thesis (following Robertson Smith) that sac- redness itself is ambiguous between the pure and the impure, the propi- tiously sacred and the unpropitiously sacred, such that there is a 'close kin- ship' between them, but also a contrast that is 'as complete as possible and even goes into the most radical antagonism,' so that 'contact between them is considered the worst of profanations.' (How, for instance, is the impurely sacred to be distinguished from the profane, a sacred profanation from a profane profanation?)" Lukes is right in recognizing a problem of ambiguity here, but the Bib- lical texts make subtle distinctions between qadosh and chillul that re- solve the apparent contradictions. For example, the impurely sacred = q'desha, the cult prostitute, is not the same as a sacred profanation = chillul, where the left-overs of a sacrifice of well-being are eaten by some- one at a time which is forbidden, that is, on the third day - "for what is sacred to the Lord, he has profaned" - ki et qodesh adonai chillel. The scholar unfamiliar with the niceties of the original Hebrew will fail to unravel this mystery, while for Durkheim these subtleties were ingrained, almost second nature. Lukes continues with a rational argument: "Part of the the whole trouble is that the dichotomy between sacred and profane, is, on the one hand, a radical distinction (assumed to be made by the religious believers) between classes of 'things' (including persons, situa- tions, etc) of which some are 'set apart' from the rest; and, on the other hand, a distinction between the way men feel and act towards, and evaluate those things (such as whether or not they feel intense respect, or religious horror, or veneration, or love towards them). Now, clearly, the second dis- tinction admits of degrees and situational flexibility; and, furthermore, it neither presupposes nor entails the first." Qadosh and Tameh Durkheim did not demonstrate the application of his model to Judaism. I shall sketch briefly what such an application might show, beginning with an analysis of the laws of purity and impurity. (i) qadosh: (a) God himself, set apart from other gods, is qadosh. (b) The land surrounding the burning bush30 is qadosh. The bush that is not consumed by its own flames stands on earth that is sacred. The voice 30 Exodus 3:2 ff</page><page sequence="10">1 12 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 of God comes from within the bush and commands Moses to remove the shoes from his feet; the interposition of material between his body and the holy ground is forbidden. (c) The firstborn male, man or beast, is qadosh.31 No matter how many children or flocks and herds a man may have, the first-born male is separated from the other offspring, either by having to be re- deemed, or sacrificed. (d) The person who devotes him- or herself to God, for whatever reason and for whatever length of time, is called a nazir - a Nazirite, that is, one who is abstinent.32 The nazir is consecrated - qadosh - to God. The nazir had to abstain from wine and strong drink; cutting of the hair was forbidden, as was contact with a corpse. Samson (Judges 13) was designated a Nazirite while still unborn, and his mother was forbidden vine products, wine and strong drink as well as food which was tame h - unclean. If a nazir was defiled by contact with a corpse, he was required to cleanse himself by means of a sin-offering and a burnt offering, and was required to shave his head which then became qadosh by means of priestly intervention, and status as a nazir was resumed.33 (e) The sabbath is qadosh, "On six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there shall be a sabbath of complete rest, a sacred occa- sion."34 Shabbat is understood in the sense of cessation from creativity and emphasises constraints on every-day activities - normal "occupa- tions." In the unlimited chaos of creation, God has used time in a mea- sured way - by numbering "days" in order to describe the creation of the space, or universe, inhabited by humans and other creatures. He takes six "days" to complete his creation and separates off the next day, call- ing it the sabbath, for rest and refreshment. Durkheim argues (in "The Life of the Australian"): "The distinctive character of feast-days in all known religions is the cessation of work and the suspension of public and private life insofar as it does not have a religious objective."35 (f) Sabbatical years and jubilee years are qadosh. Because the sabbath day is holy, therefore the sabbatical year is holy and the jubilee year (seven times seven) is holy: the land, like the people, observes a sabbath for God. The land belongs to God, and the people belong to God. The land has been given to the people, the people belong to the land, God belongs to the people. The concept of qadosh mediates between the 31 Exodus 13:2. (qadesh li kol b'chor). Nazir is also translated as "guard." 33 Numbers 6:9. " Exodus 20:8. 35 Durkheim, p. 307.</page><page sequence="11">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 113 three. The land is depicted in anthropomorphic terms - it will "vomit" out the inhabitants if they do not follow the precepts laid down.36 (g) The "fixed times" are also described as a "sacred occasion" - miqra qodesh31: the feasts of Passover, Weeks, Tabernacles and the ten days of penitence culminating in the Day of Atonement. Passover, Weeks and Tabernacles are related to the agricultural seasons - Spring, First Fruits, Harvest. Before the onset of autumn and the rainy season, the ten days of penitence and Day of Atonement are observed. This relates directly to the observations of Durkheim (re: "Intichiuma of Aus- tralia."): "Since the apparent object, at least, of the cult was at first to regularize the course of natural phenomena, the rhythm of the cosmic life has put its mark on the rhythm of the ritual life. This is why the feasts have long been associated with the seasons ..."38 (h) The tithes (Leviticus 27) are qadosh: People, land, animals and houses could be consecrated to God. (i) The Tabernacle is a holy place, but within it, separated from the enclosed space within the Tabernacle, is another holy space, the "most holy" - qodesh ha-qodashim. A veil separates the two spaces.39 Within the sanctuary are objects which are qadosh; holy oil and holy water are to be found: a lamp kindled with pure olive oil was set up in the Tent of Meeting, outside the curtain which covered the Ark of the Covenant. The holy anointing oil was used for anointing the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of the Covenant, the table and its vessels, the candlestick and its vessels, the altar of incense, the altar of burnt offering and the large copper "wash"-basin.40 The priests drew water from this basin, using it for washing their hands and feet before they entered the Tent of Meet- ing. All these vessels and therefore their contents were rendered holy by the action of anointing: "Thus you shall consecrate them so that they may be most holy (qodesh qodashim); whatever touches them shall be 36 Leviticus 18:28. &gt;' Leviticus 23.

(Em- phases mine).</page><page sequence="12">1 14 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 consecrated. You shall also anoint Aaron and his sons, consecrating them to serve me as priests." No-one outside the priestly family was permitted to enter the sanctuary, and only the high priest was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies - the qodesh haqodashim. (j) When the high priest, Aaron, approached the holy place (taberna- cle) with an offering for sacrifice, he wore holy garments, which sepa- rated him from other members of the congregation, and also indicated his increased purity - he bathed in holy water from the wash-basin be- fore donning the holy garments; they were distinct from the clothing normally worn by the high priest.41 The headdress worn by the priest was decorated with a "frontlet of pure gold," engraved with a seal in- scription "Holy to the Lord."42 The priestly family were dressed in their holy garments and holy oil was sprinkled seven times upon the altar, oil was poured on the High Priest's head - vayim'shach oto l'qod'sho - "and you shall anoint him to consecrate him." (k) The temple in Jerusalem, like the temporary tabernacle in the wilderness, was a holy place, housing an even holier place, the qodesh haqodashim, also called the d'vir.43 God himself sanctified this holy tem- ple, in the same way as he sanctified the sabbath day, setting it apart from the other days of the week, merely by the enunciation of his own, supremely authoritative, words. When the ark containing the two tablets of the ten commandments were placed in the d'vir, "... the priests came out of the sanctuary - for the cloud had filled the House of the Lord and the priests were not able to remain and perform the service because of the cloud, for the Presence of the Lord filled the House of the Lord - then Solomon declared: The Lord has chosen to abide in a thick cloud: I have now built for you a stately House, a place where You may dwell forever." (I Kings 8:10) God has chosen above all things, to make Himself qadosh - the ineffable, invisible, omnipotent, immortal deity - and it is clear that most things which are qadosh are set apart simply because He has chosen them to be so, such as the seventh day (a time), or they are directly associated with Him, like the area of earth surrounding the burning bush (a place). The vessels in the sanctuary become qadosh, however, because they have been 41 The high priest wore eight holy garments, four of linen, four of gold. Breeches, shirt, belt and turban were of linen, while the coat had golden bells amongst its orna- ments; the breastplate and apron were woven from seven different threads including gold; the headplate was made of gold. On the Day of Atonement, only the four linen garments were worn. ^ Exodus 28:36ff. 43 / Kings 8:6.</page><page sequence="13">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 115 anointed with sacred oils, as are the priests during their lengthy ordina- tion ceremony - people and objects are rendered "sanctified" by contact with a sacred substance. (ii) tame h The condition of being tameh indicates the "separateness" and isolation inherent in ritual pollution, but without any implicit undertone of qa- dosh. The explicit nature of tameh is devoid of godly attributes and contrasts strongly with ideas of qadosh because it deals with bodily func- tions, sickness and death. Examples of things that are considered to be tameh are essentially facets of life that are unavoidable; yet purification is required if the correct and acceptable social modus vivendi is to be perpetuated in holiness.44 Durkheim wrote: "the rhythm which the reli- gious life follows only expresses the rhythm of the social life and results from it."45 The universal and mundane facts of human existence may be said to spring from the actions of the bodies of men and women as they reproduce the society in which they live. A woman after childbirth is tameh - after giving birth to a son, she is impure for seven days (niddah) and thirty-three days of blood purifica- tion (d'mei tahara); after giving birth to a daughter, she is impure for fourteen days and sixty-six days of blood purification.46 Genital dis- charge from a male likewise generates ritual pollution.47 Seven days must pass, before the man washes his clothes, bathes his body in fresh water and is then clean. He also takes sin-offerings and burnt offerings to the priest.48 Before receiving the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai, the people were sanctified by Moses. They also washed their clothing and were forbidden to have sexual intercourse. Leviticus 15:19 deals with the menstruant.49 If a woman has an abnormal bleeding it generates the same polluting state as a man's genital discharge, to- gether with the prohibitions attached to it.50 Tzara at has been translated as "leprosy" but it covers various types of skin lesions and the condition is highly polluting. Touching a person who has tzara'at causes impurity. A white fabric could also be tameh 44 For the ceremonial purity of the camp to be assured, three classes of unclean persons were excluded from the community: Numbers 5:1: "remove from the camp anyone with an eruption or a discharge and anyone defiled by a corpse." ^ Durkheim, p. 349. 46 Leviticus 12:4. 47 Leviticus 15:3. ™ Leviticus 15:16-18. 4y Leviticus 15:19. 50 Leviticus 15:25-30.</page><page sequence="14">116 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 with tzara'at, as could a building. If the tzara'at spread, the fabric was to be burned, and the building was destroyed. Lewis51 has concentrated on the type of tzara 'at which pertains to the skin, associating the affliction with sin and guilt, but he ignores the fact that clothing or houses af- fected with fungus or moulds are also infected by tzara'at. In the texts, and consequently in the social context, neither the body, nor its clothing nor its dwelling is privileged in this instance. Any person touching the carcass of an unclean creature was required to "wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening." (Leviticus 1 1:25) A wooden vessel or item of clothing, or material of skin or sacking that had been in contact with the corpse of an unclean creature had to be washed in water before it was considered clean again. An earthen vessel had to be destroyed, and all food and drink that had been in contact with it was unclean. Touching the corpses of eight types of animals (e.g. mice and lizards) caused impurity. Purification and Sacrificial Ceremonies The priests at the sanctuary were the mediators between the state of tameh and the state of tahor and carried out sacrifices on behalf of the people. The priests (Kohanim) were of the tribe of Levi, and were holier than the main body of Levites, having been anointed with holy oil and sanctified. The Levites were also separated from the other eleven tribes - they received no inheritance of land in Canaan, but were given certain rights of property and sustenance. They were the vehicles through which the blessing of God was given to the people as a whole. The references to the body in this blessing show the anthropomorphic terms in which the Israelites viewed their god.52 Before the services in the sanctuary, the Levites were purified with the ashes of a red heifer, their body-hair was shaved and then they offered sacrifices. Purification ceremonies involved the use of (a) fire, and ani- mal or bird offerings (b) animal blood53 (c) water (d) a mixture of ani- mal blood and running water (e) living water, that is, fresh running water such as rainwater, the waters of a stream {mayyim chayyim) or springwater (miqveh mayyim), that is, water that has collected in a nat- 51 Lewis, p. 593. Numbers 6:24-26: The Lord bless you and protect you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance to you and grant you peace. 53 Smith, (p. 345) asserts that "the significant part of the ceremony does not lie in the death of the victim, but in the application of its life or life-blood."</page><page sequence="15">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 117 ural, not artificial, manner54 (f) a mixture of ashes and water (g) oil (h) flour (cereal, usually wheat or barley) (i) scarlet thread (j) incense. Durkheim stressed the "revolution ... Robertson Smith brought about in the traditional theory of sacrifice. Before him sacrifice was regarded as a sort of tribute or homage, either obligatory or optional, analogous to that which subjects owe to their princes. Robertson Smith was the first to remark that this classic explana- tion did not account for two essential characteristics of the rite. In the first place, it is a repast: its substance is food. Secondly, it is a repast in which the worshippers who offer it take part, along with the god to whom it is offered. . . . From this point of view, sacrifice takes on a wholly new aspect. Its essen- tial element is no longer the act of renouncement which the word sacrifice ordinarily expresses; before all, it is an act of alimentary communion."55 Smith recognised that the communal meal shared between the worship- per and the god creates a bond of kinship. He went on, however, to emphasise that the food eaten at these meals was transformed ritually, made sacred. The rituals of the Levites, "preliminary operations, lustra- tions, unctions, prayers, etc. ... transform the animal to be immolated into a sacred thing, whose sacredness is subsequently transferred to the worshipper who eats it."56 If commandments were unwittingly flouted, "through the inadvertence of the community, the whole community shall present one bull of the herd as a burnt offering . . . and one he-goat as a sin offering. The priest shall make expiation for the whole Israelite community and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and for their error they have brought their offering." Durkheim was clearly influenced by this idea; piacular rites had a "sti- mulating power over the affective state of the group and individuals" and neglect in performing such acts caused severe retribution, "anger ... acutely felt by all."57 Numbers (31:19 ff) describes the purification of warriors after battle. Purification was required after touching the slain, and garments of skin and wool and implements of wood were to be purified. "This is the ritual law that the Lord has enjoined upon Moses: Gold and silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead - any article that can withstand fire - these you shall pass through fire and they shall be clean, except that they must be cleansed with water of lustration, or sprinkling (me ' niddah); and anything 54 Leviticus 11:36: a fountain or a cistern (ie spring or well) wherein is a gathering of water - miqveh mayyim - shall be clean. JJ Durkheim, p. 336. 56 Durkheim, p. 337. 57 Lukes, p. 411.</page><page sequence="16">1 1 8 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 that cannot withstand fire you must pass through water. On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be clean, and after that you may enter the camp." To purify a metzora - a person with tzara 'at (biblical leprosy) - the priest would perform a rite after the blemished person had been banished from the camp for a week in solitary confinement. The rite involved two birds of the same species, a red thread, a cedar twig and hyssop and water. On the Day of Atonement, a similar ceremony took place, using two goats - one for the Lord and one for Azazel. The latter was pushed over a cliff - the first "scapegoat" - to atone for communal sins, while the former was sacrificed as a sin-offering and its blood sprinkled in the q o des h haqodashim. Although most sacrifices utilized bulls, rams, lambs and goats - male creatures - the sacrifice of a cow was used specifically for purification of highly polluting states. Contact with a corpse was the primary source of turn 'ah - pollution; a priest was not permitted to touch a corpse, unless it was that of his wife, parent, child, brother or unmarried sister. How- ever even the high priest was permitted to touch an unidentified Jewish corpse - it had to be buried, simply because of the prohibition on delay when dealing with any corpse, even that of a wrong-doer.58 Purification to remove corpse-impurity was thus a most important rite, given the ubiquitous presence of corpses in everyday life and parti- cularly during the period of war and violence described in these texts. The ceremony using the ashes of the red heifer was to purify those who had come into contact with a corpse, either directly on the field of battle, or merely by being present in the enclosed area of death when it took place in the home; even contact with a bone of a corpse caused ritual impurity. The parah adumah - red heifer - was an unusual animal; she had no blemish and her hide was absolutely red. Water was used for purification in the states of uncleanness not asso- ciated with bloodshed or slaughter; blood was used for atonement or protection. The skin, blood, flesh and dung of the red heifer were burnt, and the ashes mixed with running water (mayyim hayyim - living waters) to serve as the purifying medium for corpse-pollution. The burnt blood of the heifer acted against the impurity caused by contact with "blood," the dominant symbol of life and death, inasmuch as blood must never be eaten, and the term "blood guilt" was used in cases of death by murder. The red of the heifer symbolised sin and the significance of fire in the burning ceremony became combined with the purifying action 58 Deuteronomy 21:22.</page><page sequence="17">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 119 of water in the mixture of ashes and water, providing a double efficacy in the purification rite; a symbolic combination of fire and water was mar- shalled against the contagion of contact with death. Durkheim reflected on "how the energy and force of expansion which they (that is, 'good' and 'evil') have in common do not enable us to understand how, in spite of the conflict which divides them, they may be transformed into one another or substituted for each other in their respective functions, and how the pure may contaminate while the impure sometimes serves to sanctify."59 Durkheim' s explanation of substitution in sacrifice is exemplified in the case of the red heifer: "... we cannot doubt that the expiatory victim was charged with the impurity of the sin."60 Even though the animal itself was t'rnimah (unblemished), the clean person who carried out the rite of burning the heifer together with cedarwood, hyssop and scarlet thread then became unclean, as was the priest who participated in the cere- mony. They were both required to wash and remained unclean until the evening. Another clean man (tahor) then had to remove the ashes to a clean place, whereupon he, too, became tameh, had to wash himself and his clothes and was unclean until the evening. The ashes were then mixed with running water in a bowl, and used in the powerful cleansing rite of pollution from a corpse. It therefore becomes apparent that because God himself is set apart, qadosh, the people who follow his ways are also qadosh; opposed to the sacred is the "common" as well as the impure. Ritual impurity can be removed by priestly intervention, but that which is innately tameh, such as the corpse of an unclean animal, cannot be purified; the person who has come into contact with the tameh can, however, be purified. The contagion of the tameh spreads by touch, just as the holiness of the sacred anointing oil renders that which it touches qadosh. Impurity and Sin There is a complex but marked contrast between being impure and being a sinner, one that is often misconstrued by commentators in the Christian tradition. States of purity and impurity and the condition of being "set apart" are distinct from ideas of sin and atonement. Although the offerings for purification after ritual impurity may be "sin" offerings, 59 Durkheim, p. 412. 60 Durkheim, p. 412.</page><page sequence="18">120 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 states of ritual impurity are linked with social, not physical death. Those actions which are seen as potentially destructive of the fabric of society, like murder, incest and adultery, are sins linked to death. Lewis61 has pointed out that sin offerings are required for "inadvertent sins, not wilful sin; rebelliously or presumptuously to break commandments would merit death. The 'sins' which require the sin-offering are inadvertent transgressions and include the conditions of ritual impurity. Sin in this sense includes defilement and uncleanness. It is the action or the state which matters, not intention. The laws and rules are like taboos. Sin and uncleanness are conflated." The fact is that actual, physical death results from certain acts, whereas a temporary, social "death" is the result of a skin-eruption, a non-semi- nal discharge and corpse contamination. Being excluded from the camp for seven or fourteen days is not the same as being stoned to death. But Lewis quotes Deuteronomy 30 62 (regarding worship of other gods and exile - the connection is clear in the passage) in the context of leprosy, not idol worship.63 Douglas relates leprosy with idol worship and death.64 Again, Lewis states "Leviticus does not judge the leper morally, but it defines him as one of the category of persons and things which are ritually impure. As Brody (1974: 111-12) points out, although there is no explicit moral condemnation of the man found to be leprous, the terms for moral valuation are all there in the text. Leviticus does not deny that leprosy is a punishment for sin; it simply ignores the idea."65 I disagree with Brody - I do not think that "the terms for moral valua- tion" are "all there in the text." The whole point about states of ritual impurity like having sexual intercourse and being unclean, or menstru- ating and being unclean, or having tzara'at, is that there is no moral condemnation. Lewis writes that "Ideas of pollution and sin both touch leprosy and time has tangled them all up," but he himself has tangled up some of the ideas. He quotes Leviticus 18- 61 Lewis, p. 606. Deuteronomy 30:15,16: See, I set before you this day life and prosperity, death and adversity. For I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His laws, and His rules, that you may thrive and increase, and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess. 0J Lewis, p. 602. Douglas 1993, p. 212: Miriam's story affords a glimpse of theological reflections on life and death. Leprosy in the Bible is equated with idolatry, and idolatry is equated with death; here is Miriam, suspended miserably between living and dying, her flesh half-consumed. 03 Lewis, p. 598.</page><page sequence="19">(1998) The Legacy of "Sacred" and "Profane" in Ancient Israel 121 "Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things; for in all these the nations are defiled, which I cast out before you. And the land was defiled, therefore did I visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomited out her inha- bitants." This is taken out of context. Lewis links it with "why must the leper be kept outside the camp," but in Leviticus, the particular verse quoted comes directly after the verses about "uncovering nakedness" - that is, incest with mother, father, son, daughter, etc. - or marrying two sisters, or having sex with a menstruant, or adultery, bestiality, and male homo- sexual acts. He has conflated leprosy with the "iniquity" of adultery and incest. In sum, Lewis66 and Douglas67 place great emphasis on the life-death dichotomy in analysing ritual pollution and ritual purity. This appears to me to be an assumption which is deeply influenced by post-biblical ideas of salvation and afterlife. Lewis conflates life with good and death with evil;68 but life is not tahor, nor is death tameh. The Pentateuch reverberates with the effects of the continuous movement between way- wardness and faith, of people who are both obedient and disobedient to the word of God, and who move between states of ritual impurity and ritual purity. The leper calls out "unclean, unclean" - tameh, tameh, not "death, death;" he is unclean "as long as the plague (or affliction) is on him." Miriam was struck with skin eruption not for idolatry, but be- cause of her slander against Moses regarding his Midianite wife. "Le- pers" could be rehabilitated and purified, corpses must be dealt with and buried swiftly. It is contact with a corpse that causes impurity; the living person with a genital discharge is tameh; the menstruating woman is tameh. Eilberg-Schwartz69 suggests "that the priestly rules governing bodily emissions constitute a subsystem of a larger set of prohibitions that express a distinction between life and death. . . . However, there are some anomalies that stubbornly resist this symbolic interpretation;" and Lewis does argue that "A spiritual afterlife is no issue in the Cove- 66 Lewis, p. 593: There was ... a contrast between priest and leper, a contrast of type and anti-type, the opposition between holy and unclean. The principle at stake was the value set on life as against death. p. 601: The underlying religious theme ... is the contrast between death and life; death is polluting, life is the great good. Priest and nazirite contrast with leper; priest and nazirite have to do with holy things; the leper is tainted as if by death. 67 Douglas 1993, p. 158: ... put lepers outside the camp (and) ... anybody contami- nated by corpse contact. This is the Lord's first taboo. His worshippers must have nothing to do with death, nor with dead bodies. 68 Lewis, p. 602. 6y Eilberg-Schwartz, p. 185.</page><page sequence="20">122 Maureen Bloom JSQ 5 nant."70 If there are overtones of dread of death, these surely refer to social death, as in being "cut off" without heirs, but not spiritual death. My interpretation, therefore, would be that ritual purity, ritual pollu- tion, sacrifice and holiness are so much a part of everyday events in the world created by the ancient Hebrews, that their God's interest in these states reflects his interest in daily personal behaviour. Although God is "set apart," he invests enough of this characteristic of himself into the significance of daily personal and communal actions and offerings; thus, by obeying the laws and being tahor, provision is made for being qadosh. It can therefore be said that Ancient Judaism hinges on notions of things that are "set apart" and sacred, as opposed to things which are "common" or "profane," in addition to things that are "pure" as op- posed to those which are "impure." These concepts, so central in Dur- kheim's theory of religion, fit Judaism well, and probably derive from it. Bibliography Brody, S N, 1974. The Disease of the Soul Ithaca: Cornell University Press.
