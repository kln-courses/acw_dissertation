ROSENBERG Though men have always speculated as to the nature of heredity, it was not until the second half of the nineteenth century that the principles which govern it became the object of concerted scientific investigation. The statistical methods of Galton and Pearson had for the first time, it seemed, provided a means of determining the elusive laws of human heredity. Yet within a few years of its creation, the new discipline of biometrics had, in the minds of many biologists, become obsolete. In 1900, the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's neglected conclusions seemed to provide an explanation for those phenomena which statistical methods were capable only of describing.1 It was inevitable that the laws which the Austrian monk had found to govern inheritance in garden peas would soon be applied to human heredity. It was equally inevitable that this work should prove inconclusive. Man is not an ideal experimental animal, and the tools and concepts of biology at the turn of the century were not equal to unravelling the complexities of human genetics. Equally important, the very attitudes which inspired scientists to apply Mendelian- ism immediately to the inheritance of human traits, made an objective study of these traits impossible. To many of the early workers in the field, human genetics was indistinguishable from eugenics; their findings were blueprints for social action. Charles Benedict Davenport was the most active and prominent of such early American geneticists. 1 Charles Benedict Davenport was born in 1866. Though raised in Brooklyn, this descendant of Puritan divines always prided himself on his New England ancestry. " I have been an American for three-quarters of a century," he wrote in 1942. " No, longer than that - for over three * 'This paper was originally read at a meeting of the Johns Hopkins Medical History Club, February 6, 1961. 1 The mid-nineteenth-century interest in species and evolution, paradoxically to us, created a climate of opinion which discouraged interest in ascertaining the mechanisms of heredity. Cf. Elizabeth B. Gasking, "Why was Mendel's work ignored?," /. Hist. Ideas , 1959, 20: 60-84. By the last two decades of the century, however, this climate of opinion had begun to change, as witness the work of Galton and Weissman, as well as the rediscovery of Mendel's work by three different investigators almost simultaneously. 266</page><page sequence="2">CHARLES BENEDICT DAVENPORT 267 hundred years. For this ' I ' is composed of elements that were brought to this country during the 17th century." 2 Despite an absorbing childhood interest in natural history, young Charles was destined by his authoritarian father for a career in the more reliable profession of engineering. It was only after he had graduated from the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, earned a bit of money with his engineering skills, and, still more important, attained his majority, that the prospective scientist was capable of defying his father's wishes. The dedicated young man finally entered Harvard College in 1887, at the age of twenty-one, and within two years received his bachelor's degree. Another three years in Cambridge brought him a doctorate in zoology. Davenport then served Harvard for seven years as Instructor, until de- livered from this Egyptian bondage by the University of Chicago's offer of an assistant professorship. In 1901, he was promoted to Associate Pro- fessor, only to resign three years later. He had been offered something which he had always wanted and which he could not well refuse, the directorship of his own research institute. Largely at Davenport's initiative, the Carnegie Institution had estab- lished a Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, and appointed the ambitious young zoologist as director.3 Daven- port was to occupy this position for thirty years, from his appointment in 1904 until his retirement in 1934. During these three decades he devoted his research almost entirely to human genetics. While at Harvard and Chicago, Davenport had already established him- self as a leader in the use of biostatistics. The years spent in engineering school had not been entirely wasted. Davenport brought to his zoological studies a mathematical preparation far greater than was customary among a Cited by Morris Steggarda, "Charles Benedict Davenport (1866-1944).

Dr. MacDowell was kind enough to act as my cicerone through the Davenport papers deposited at the Department of Genetics, Carnegie Institu- tion, Cold Spring Harbor.

ROSENBERG biologists of his day. Until his acceptance of Mendelianism, Davenport had been convinced that the future of biology lay in these new quantitative methods. The application of these procedures, he wrote enthusiastically in 1900, had already borne fruit. The role of natural selection, the method of evolution, and the laws of inheritance are being discovered. Already we are able to predict greater results from the quantitative methods in biology, especially where combined with experimentation, than any which have yet appeared.4 These central problems of biology all seemed within reach of solution - even the vexing question of heredity, for heredity was, as Davenport put it, "only a special case of correlated variation; a correlation between parents and offspring or between any two blood relatives.,, 5 With scientific opinion of heredity in so murky and ill-defined a state, the generalizations of Mendel appeared with almost the power of revela- tion. For the first time, heredity could be understood and even predicted. Charles Davenport had always been interested in heredity and evolu- tion, and he lost no time in acquainting himself with these new ideas. He was, in fact, the author of one of the earliest, if not the very first, Ameri- can discussion of the papers by Correns and De Vries - who along with Tschermak whose work was not known to Davenport - had independently rediscovered Mendelian principles. (The article appeared in June of 1901 in the Biological Bulletin of the Woods Hole Marine Biological Labora- tory, though Davenport's diary records his having written it in November of the previous year).6 Though he did not immediately discontinue his 4 " A history of the quantitative study of variation," Science , 1900, n. s. 12: 870. Daven- port was prominent enough in biostatistics for Karl Pearson to have asked him to serve as American editor of Biometrika when the journal was founded in 1901. Davenport was also the author of the first American hand-book on the subject, Statistical Methods with Special Reference to Biological Variation , New York: John Wiley, 1899. This little manual eventually went to four editions, the last in 1936. 8 " The statistical study of evolution," Popular Sc. Monthly, Sept., 1901, p. 459. It must be recalled that in 1900 the ideas of Weissman were still very much a matter of controversy. Indeed, the entire problem of heredity was, to most biologists and physicians, no clearer than it had been centuries earlier. Davenport, for example, suggested that biometrics might be used in finally proving or disproving the existence of telegony, the idea that a woman's first mate might have an effect upon her children by a subsequent sire. Thus, a woman having intercourse with a Negro might later have dark pigmented children by a white father.

Both theories opened new areas of research, and in both cases much of this research was premature and uncritical. And Charles Davenport was not only uncritical, he was almost painfully ambitious and emotionally committed to the results of his studies. There could be no more important social goal, he believed, than the enactment of genetic truths into law. Even before 1900, Davenport had been deeply interested in the eugenics movement. His original enthusiasm for Galton's biometrics was at least partially a reflection of this interest. True progress, he believed, could come only through improvements in man's germ plasm. Heredity, as Davenport warned in 1910, " stands as the one great hope of the human race; its savior from imbecility, poverty, disease, immorality." In this conviction, Davenport was never to be shaken. Social problems, he ad- monished a group of medical students in 1940, were coming more and more to be recognized as biological problems.8 Unfortunately, human beings are not so easily studied as garden peas or drosophila. Nor are most human traits easily accommodated by the simplistic doctrine which Mendelianism seemed to most biologists to be in the century's first decade. Indeed, as late as 1912, Davenport wrote con- fidently that " modern studies in heredity have made that science relatively simple." 9 When he began research in genetics, Davenport assumed that 7 The break between Davenport and Pearson, despite their personal differences, was very much a part of the more general conflict between those, like Bateson, who whole- heartedly accepted the ideas of Mendel and De Vries, and men, like Pearson, who for one reason or another remained sceptical.

ROSENBERG human traits were diserete, unit characters determined by pairs of distinct immutable factors, one of which might often mask or dominate the other. Davenport tended to assume as well that dominance meant the presence of something, and recessiveness its absence. It was not yet customary to think in terms of alternatives. Working after 1900 almost exclusively with human material, he was, moreover, forced to rely for data upon pedigree studies. Yet despite these conceptual and methodological limitations, Daven- port made real contributions to the study of human genetics. He was, for example, one of the first investigators to apply the concept of poly- genic inheritance to a human trait. In 1910, in a paper published with his wife Gertrude, Davenport concluded that the gradations of human skin color might well be determined by the combined action of two independent pairs of factors.10 Indeed, as early as 1908, Davenport had suggested that so-called blending inheritance was probably due to " a Mendelian inherit- ance of minute units." 11 He was also one of the first to explain the deter- mination of a human trait (eye color) in terms of multiple alleles. Where the pedigree method was of value, as in a number of hereditary or sup- posedly hereditary defects such as albinism, Huntington's chorea, and otosclerosis, Davenport was able to contribute valuable data. To Charles Davenport, however, those traits which most demanded study were those determining human behavior. Yet it was in the field of behavior genetics that the pedigree method was most inadequate and in which Dr. Davenport's social commitments were in sharpest conflict with his scientific objectivity. It was also, ironically enough, the area in which the discarded correlations and standard deviations of the Galton laboratory would have been most useful.

Over the years, however, Daven- port rigidly applied the formula which had seemed to explain Successfully the inheritance of skin color to other traits such a body-build, otosclerosis, and suspectibility to goiter, though in the latter two conditions he assumed that one of the factors was on an auto- some, the other on a sex-chromosome.

But could such aspects of human behavior be studied? Let us look more specifically at one of Davenport's personality studies and see how he at- tempted to approach such problems. In 1917, with war imminent, he undertook to isolate those criteria which might be useful in predicting the success of future naval officers. Davenport began by choosing sixty- eight historically prominent naval commanders and, making use of bi- ographies, memoirs, and biographical dictionaries, compiled a list of those characteristics which they had displayed as children and which, Davenport asserted, could be used to predict the likelihood of their success as officers. Foremost among such desirable traits, he concluded, was an inborn love of the sea, or thalasophilia. This lust for the sea, Davenport contended, was almost certainly due to a sex-linked recessive factor. (That it was sex-linked seemed apparent, because men, not women, ran away to sea.)12 Other social traits could, similarly, be shown to depend upon genetic determinants. Prostitution, for example, was a consequence neither of economic nor psychological factors, but of hereditary predisposition. In a study of 350 " wayward " girls, only one, Davenport reported, had entered the ancient trade for economic reasons. Innate eroticism was the causative factor, and this was produced by " an additional germinal de- terminer that less licentious persons do not have." 18 Charles Davenport was to adhere consistently to this interpretation of human behavior until his death in 1944. His convictions were too deeply rooted in his opposition to social change and too much a product of the scientific concerns and presuppositions of the generation in which he grew to maturity. 2 Like many of his scientific contemporaries, Davenport was a rigid biological mechanist. Every aspect of human behavior had its origins in definite physiological and anatomical mechanisms. Behavior, he wrote in 1917, " is reaction to stimulus, and the nature of the reaction is deter- ia Davenport, assisted by Mary Theresa Scudder, Naval Officers.

ROSENBERG mined in part by the nature of the reacting nervous machinery." 14 Thus variations in behavior implied underlying structural and functional dif- ferences. If Negroes and whites differed in their performance on psycho- logical tests, it was because they differed in neurological attributes just as they did in skin color or hair texture. " The brains," Davenport asserted in 1926, " of great speakers are of one type; those of philosophers of another type; those of the menial another type; those of morons, im- beciles, Mongolian idiots of still other types. The mental output is what it is, to a great degree, because of the nature of the machinery that controls the output." 15 Nor did it seem arbitrary to Davenport that he should regard such traits as industry, sympathy, or loyalty as though they were well-defined unit characters. Influenced by concepts of cerebral localization which had begun with the neuro-anatoniical theories of Gall, many nineteenth century neurologists and psychiatrists found it increasingly natural to think of intellectual and emotional traits as discrete entities, localized in particular areas of the brain.16 If there was a speech center, then why not a center for eroticism as well? And, assuming as Davenport did, that such traits were anatomically grounded and functionally independent, it was equally natural to assume that they should have a genetic basis. For Davenport it was unquestionable. All organic phenomena were seen by Davenport's generation of biolo- gists in relation to their place in the process of evolution. Davenport, unlike many of his colleagues however, regarded not only physical, but cultural and social, traits as being products of this same evolutionary 14 Naval Officers , p. 9. 15 " The nature of hereditary mental defect," p. 5, reprinted from Proc .

Ontogeny, as Davenport believed, recapitulated phy- logeny in the child's socialization as well as in his physical growth. The child, like prehistoric man, was selfish, violent, and erotic. Normal children, however, were able as they grew older to control, to shunt off, as Davenport put it, these primeval impulses. The criminal was a criminal, the prostitute a prostitute, because their genetic makeup had not provided them with the neurological or physiological means of circumventing these brute urges.18 Feeble-mindedness too resulted from the persistence of more primitive genes. It was, as Davenport declared, " an uninterrupted transmission from our animal ancestry. It is not reversion; it is direct inheritance." ia 17 It was almost second-nature to Davenport - and many of his contemporaries - to think in phylogenetic terms. In his 1901 article on Mendel, Davenport rioted in passing that : "In some cases the dominating form is the systematically higher; in othfeťs, it is the older or ancestral form.". "Mendel's law of dichotomy," p. 308. In his later years, after increasing criticism of his genetic work drove him towards physical anthropology, Davenport's anthropomorphic researches frequently consisted of gathering data to prove that ontogeny really did recapitulate phylogeny.

Davenport's debt to Lombroso and criminal anthropology is apparent, as is his debt to the earlier theory of degeneration (from which, of course, Lombroso drew his inspira- tion). In addition to his acceptance of the idea of "atavism," Davenport believed, for example, in the connection between insanity and genius, in the possibility of physical stigmata marking the insane and feeble-minded, as well as in the existence of a basic " neuropathic weakness," which might manifest itself in insanity, pauperism, mental retar- dation, or criminality. This doctrine which began in the 1850's as a melioristic one, assumed, of course, to a generation rejecting the inheritance of acquired characteristics, a conservative and deterministic aspect The basic study of the idea of degeneration is still that by Gš-P.-H.

ROSENBERG Social and physical evolution were one. Attempts to improve man by changing his environment were, Davenport believed, doomed to futility. The efforts of social workers, even of medicine and public health, were ultimately contrary to the direction of evolution. In the years before 1900, liberal intellectuals, led in this country by Lester Ward, had formulated a detailed indictment of Social Darwinism, an indictment based on the assumption that a qualitative distinction existed between physical and social evolution.20 In Davenport's hands this dichotomy disappeared ; cul- tural change merely reflected underlying physical developments. The ideas of Mendel and De Vries had been used to adapt those of Herbert Spencer to the demands of a new century. " Barring a few highly exceptional conditions," Davenport wrote in 1911, " poverty means relative inefficiency and this in turn usually means mental inferiority." Wages and salaries, profits and honors were the rewards given by society to its " effective " and moral members. The principle of equality was a biological absurdity. Yet these truths seemed to him increasingly ignored in twentieth-century America. The values which Davenport had assumed as a child were, he felt, being replaced by those of paternalism. " A demand for more social workers," he warned in 1912, " and larger institutions for defectives will be the first alarm of the approaching end of the old regime." And as the century progressed, his fears seemed to have justified themselves. Welfare agencies, he wrote to Frederick Osborn in the terrible December of 1932, were a " force crushing out civilization." 21 3 A preoccupation with the idea of race was characteristic of European and American minds in the half-century between 1880 and 1930. Charles Davenport was no exception: two of his major research interests were the effects of race-crossing and the comparative social traits of different races. Davenport never doubted that racial traits were as immutable as the genes which produced them. America, as Davenport interpreted the nation's history, was the product of Anglo-Saxon genes, and it seemed to him questionable whether this democracy could long survive the dilution of the blood which had created it. The only hope of the republic, he believed, lay in the success of the 20 For a survey of this conflict, see Richard Hofstadter, Social Darwinism in American Thought , 1860-1915, Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania, 1944. 81 Heredity in Relation to Eugenics , New York: Holt, 1911, p. 80; "Heredity, culpa- bility, praiseworthiness," p. 37; Delineator , April, 1912, p. 272; Davenport to Frederick Osborn, Dec. 23, 1932.</page><page sequence="10">CHARLES BENEDICT DAVENPORT 275 immigration restriction movement, a cause to which he gave his whole- hearted support and to which he lent without reservation the prestige of his scientific position. As a consequence of the tremendous influx of immigrants from Southeastern Europe, Davenport wrote in 1911, the American population would " rapidly become darker in pigmentation, smaller in stature, more mercurial, more attached to music and art, more given to crimes of larceny, kidnapping, assault, murder, rape and sex immorality." 22 By the late twenties and early thirties such pronouncements were being received by American scientists with increasing uneasiness. After the National Socialist party had implemented these ideas in Germany, such concepts began to seem not merely gauche but dangerous. The intellectual break which most geneticists had made with the eugenics movement in the twenties had become a public one by the late thirties. In 1940, the Car- negie Institution withdrew the last of its support from the eugenics program at Cold Spring Harbor. Davenport was now seventy-four, six years in retirement, a prophet without followers. Yet though the crusade which had filled his life had ended in failure, he did not despair, but con- tinued to work actively until almost the day of his death in 1944. In his ten years of retirement, Davenport published forty-seven papers, wrote one book, and revised another.23 * * * Human genetics has been recreated in the past three decades. Eugenics is, in 1961, more the concern of the historian than the scientist. What then were the contributions of Charles Benedict Davenport to the nation and the science he wished so well? For his career is more than an object lesson in the ways through which social and personal attitudes can distort the conclusions of science. If only because of his acceptance and championing of both biostatistics and Mendelianism, Davenport would have been of real importance in the 22 Heredity in Relation to Eugenics , p. 219. The story of Davenporťs relationship to the eugenics and immigration restriction movements, as well as the fate of these movements in the 1930's, is excellently told by Haller, " American Eugenics." It might, however, be noted that Davenporťs conservative rejection of the change he saw about him and of those peoples whom he accused of bringing this change, was not the only one possible for a person of his time and class. Society limits and provides alterna- tives ; individual personality chooses between them. Davenport's brother, for example, the Reverend William Davenport, directed a settlement house for Italian immigrants in Brooklyn and wrote often to his brother at Cold Spring Harbor, defending the immigrants as victims of circumstances, cf. especially, William Davenport to C.

Though never a major contributor in either field, he had the imagination to realize at once the significance of these new ideas. Davenport emphasized as well the importance of con- stitutional factors at a time when most of his contemporaries found it easy to overlook them. The germ theory, he pointed out again and again, was only a partial explanation of disease processes. Everyone was exposed to the tubercle bacillus, but only some died of tuberculosis. Not all alcoholics exhibited delirium tremens, he argued, nor was goiter simply the result of iodine insufficiency. Perhaps most important, Davenport was an early example of that much neglected figure in the history of science, the statesman administrator, the ambassador to the laity from the world of science. Davenport not only created a wide interest in genetics with his writings and addresses, but was able as well to attract what were, for his time, enormous research funds. The Harriman, Huntington, and Rockefeller families, as well as the Carnegie Institution, contributed to his research programs. Such blessings were not so common in the first quarter of the century as they have become today. There were few American geneticists of note in the first three decades of the century who did not spend at least a summer at Cold Spring Harbor. It is probable that it will be for such activities out- side the laboratory, rather than for those in it, that Charles Benedict Davenport will ultimately be remembered.</page></plain_text>
