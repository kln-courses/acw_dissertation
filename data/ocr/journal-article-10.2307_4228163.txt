<plain_text><page sequence="1">JJOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXXIX No. 2 June 2005 Processes of Gradual Institutional Drift William H. Redmond Just as there are different kinds of institutions, there are different kinds of institutional change. Institutions may be habits, norms, customs, rules, or laws; change may take the form of evolutionary change or revolutionary change. The present paper is concerned with one specific type of change, namely, the drift of customs or traditions. Customs and traditions, like other institutions, generally exhibit a resistance to change due to their cer- emonial character. The changes that do occur tend to be both incremental and gradual. Hence the fact of institutional drift is often obscured by its slow pace and is most fre- quently brought to notice by members of an older generation. In evolutionary terms, this may be seen as the imperfect reproduction of institutions over time. This type of institutional change is not generally the result of deliberation or plan- ning but is a process of adjustment to larger changes in the social environment. That is, the imperfect reproduction does not represent a random mutation but instead is directed by concurrent social or cultural forces. The result is a network of institutions that is "insensibly but incessantly" changing over time (Veblen 11898] 1914). The fol- lowing outlines a mechanism underlying the process of institutional drift. I argue that individuals characteristically think about institutions in such a way as to maintain a con- sistent relationship among them so that if an important institution undergoes change, other institutions are subject to realignment. Cognitive Processing of Institutions 'What accounts for the dual properties of insensibly and incessantly in institutional drift? Three aspects of how the mind operates on institutions are of particular interest The author is a Professor in the College of Business Administration, Bowling Green State University, Ohio, USA.

Redmond for the analysis of institutional drift. First, institutions are not isolated but are mentally associated with one another. Second, in consequence of these mental associations, peo- ple seek consistency in the relationships. Third, association and consistency can operate at the nonconscious level. The process of institutional adjustment has been observed in many societies and many times. Such a widespread and cross-cultural tendency suggests a biological basis for institutional realignment. Specific properties of the mind are out- lined next, followed by a brief analysis of their impact on institutional drift. The subse- quent section illustrates by examining gradual drift in a prominent holiday. The Evolved Mind The environment in which the human mind evolved was an environment featuring the presence of other evolving humans. The presence of other evolving humans is argued to be of central importance to the evolutionary path of the human mind (Ingold 1986; Nozick 1993). All humans rely on institutions, so it is thought that institutions have adaptational advantages for survival and is further thought that the human mind has evolved in ways that facilitate the use of institutions (Redmond 2004). Long-term memory in humans is structured by association (Shapiro and Eichenbaum 1997).1 The associational structure of memory is a product of evolution but one which is shared with primates and other species. Extensive reliance on institutions, however, is the special province of humans and was shaped in specific ways by evolution. Concepts and beliefs are linked with related concepts and beliefs in the human memory (Kunda 1999). Researchers from various disciplines have examined a characteristically human drive for what is variously referred to as consistency, coherence, congruency, or conso- nance (e.g., Festinger 1962; Piaget 1963). This is a tendency toward or bias in favor of beliefs and experiences which harmonize with, or which do not conflict with, one another. The conclusion of cognitive scientists, as well as others working from an evolu- tionary standpoint, is that the drive for cognitive consistency is inherited rather than learned (e.g., Leslie 1988; Hirshfeld and Gelman 1994).2 The tendency toward consis- tency is not limited to critical or prominent situations: Lawrence Hirschfeld and S. Gelman (1994) noted that ordinary, everyday thoughts are characterized by a coherence of beliefs and causal principles. In order to conserve active attention for important events, the human mind pro- cesses large amounts of information below the level of consciousness. This is known as the "cognitive unconscious" and operates in parallel with conscious processing (Fuster 1995; Kunda 1999). Some believe that a majority of human cognitive processing takes place are on the nonconscious level (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson 1999).3 Institutional Association A large number of institutions operate to shape human behavior, and these are associated with one another. Such relatedness is reflected in terminology such as the</page><page sequence="3">Processes of Gradual Institutional Drift 503 "institutional fabric" (Veblen 1909) or the "organic complex" of institutions (Veblen [18991 1965). Institutions are related because they impact related aspects of behavior, that is, they coordinate behaviors into a consistent pattern. Institutions, ranging from habits to formalized ritual, regularly show a process of adjustment to one another (e.g., Ingold 1986). The ongoing adaptation of institutions in a culture is also referred to as integration (Murdock 1971). Thus changes in one may necessitate changes in others in order to preserve the consistency and integration. As institutions are products of the human mind, so is institutional adjustment: The code of proprieties, conventionalities, and usages in vogue at any given time and among any given people has more or less of the character of an organic whole; so that any appreciable change in one point of the scheme involves something of a change or readjustment at other points also. (Veblen [18991 1965, 201) Interrelated institutions are correspondingly related in the mind. This associative aspect of memory means that change in one institution cannot be perceived as isolated and con- sequently is not ignored in relation to other institutions. Change in one produces adjust- ments in others, hence the property of incessantly changing. Certain institutions are more central to society and social processes than others. Thorstein Veblen noted that any given culture has a certain "genius" or "spirit" which imparts a characteristic tone or bias to its entire institutional structure (1914). Such a genius or spirit elevates particular institutions to a central or superordinate position. Changes in such a superordinate institution would result in adjustments to numerous other institutions. Consequently the observed drift in a subordinate institution is not random but rather is given direction by changes in the superordinate institution in a process of cumulative change. Institutional Consistency In studying processes of change, anthropologists find certain features in common across cultures, one of which is institutional adjustment in the direction of consistency. Individuals fit the meanings of various institutions into a consistent and coherent framework (Berger and Luckmann 1966). The tendency to move from inconsistent to consistent states is thought to be a fundamental aspect of human thinking and is reflected in Veblen's characterization of human nature as a coherent structure of habits and propensities ([1898] 1919, 74). Further, as Veblen noted: Habits of thought with respect to the expression of life in any given direction unavoidably affect the habitual view of what is good and right in life in other directions also. (116) Examples of consistency in the social sciences include theories of social psychology (e.g., Festinger 1962) and cognitive psychology (e.g., Heider 1946). For instance, Fritz</page><page sequence="4">504 William H. Redmond Heider's thesis is that inconsistencies produce mental tension which must be resolved by altering one of the beliefs in the set of belief relationships. In other words, inconsis- tencies produce an uncomfortable mental state which is subsequently relieved through a process of adjustment of beliefs. This resolution process may involve a conscious effort but often proceeds without conscious awareness, hence the property of insensibility in institutional drift. Heterodox economists have also employed the concept of consistency. In Sour Grapes, Jon Elster (1983) outlined the adjustment of beliefs to realities. As in the fable, if one can't reach the grapes, one can at least reach the conclusion that the grapes weren't worth having anyway. This is a process of adaptation which reduces mental tension. Elster also noted that this process of adjustment can and frequently does occur on a nonconscious basis. That is, it takes place more or less automatically. The state of tension may be thought of as the psychological manifestation of the metaphorical friction which arises between institutions which have moved out of align- ment. As Stephen Edgell observe-d, "institutions that emerge during one era may persist into another and the resulting cultural lag is likely to give rise to 'friction' between the habits of thought generated by the new material conditions and the habits and institu- tions more appropriate to an earlier period of cultural development" (1975, 272).4 For present purposes, the relationship between a superordinate institution and a subordinate one is of interest. Assuming a prior state of consistency, a change in the superordinate will result in an inconsistent relationship to the subordinate. The state of tension occasioned by this can be resolved by modifying the subordinate institution to suitably correspond with the superordinate. In many cases, the degree of tension may be sufficiently low so as not to stimulate conscious awareness, but the drive for consistency still operates below the level of consciousness. To summarize, the gradual drift of institutions is the product of fundamental char- acteristics of human thought processes. The mind has an evolved tendency to associate related concepts in memory and to produce a consistent worldview. Key aspects of this evolved capacity include the drive for consistency among associated institutions and the nonconscious mental processing of consistency-related adjustments. Gradual Drift in Christmas Observance A prime example of institutional drift is the cumulative change in U.S. Christmas traditions over the past six or seven generations. The following examination positions Christmas as a subordinate institution and seeks to explain gradual change in its obser- vance as an adjustment to changes in more central institutions. The superordinate val- ues in question are materialism and secularization (Tool 1979; Ayres 1961). Hence the argument is that a growing social emphasis on materialism and secularity has resulted in correspondingly changed modes of Christmas observance over the course of generations.</page><page sequence="5">Processes of Gradual Institutional Drift 505 Some of us may remember apparently simpler Christmases which, in turn, were not viewed by our grandparents as particularly simple. Historians, sociologists, and anthro- pologists trace a continuous pattern of changes to the latter half of the nineteenth cen- tury. This process of change was largely nonconscious and unplanned. As Penne Restad noted, "Surely, though, this American holiday did not evolve by collaboration or design" (1995, 108). Materialism Christmas was not designated a federal holiday until 1870, and prior to this time Christmas observance in America had a markedly lower orientation to materialism. Entertaining friends and family with food and drink were dominant elements of Christ- mas observance. Presents were few and small enough to fit inside stockings. The major- ity of gifts consisted of fruits and candies (Waits 1993). A child's stocking might contain a small toy (often homemade) or a coin, while a switch for misbehavior was not uncom- mon (Restad 1995). Stockings, however, were subsequently relegated to a mainly sym- bolic role due to insufficient carrying capacity (Marling 2000). The growth and spread of a materialistic orientation has unfolded over an extended period. As Leigh Schmidt has noted, this has had a systematic effect on noneconomic life: From the late eighteenth century into the twentieth, this expanding world of goods shaped more and more aspects of American social life, and its bond would be felt with particular weight in the realm of ritual, festival and celebra- tion. (1995, 33) In other words, the superordinate value of materialism has encroached in a consistent and cumulative way on a number of customs and traditions. Prior to the 1870s, Christmas observance was also marked by variability, both on a regional as well as individual basis. From this period, however, a more uniform practice emerged, largely under the impetus of nationally distributed magazines and also from the sales strategies of large department stores (Restad 1995; Marling 2000). Magazines, followed by newspapers, were instrumental in positioning gift giving as a central aspect of the Christmas observance. Editorials equated gift giving with the Christmas spirit, a theme echoed by advertising copy. Subsequently, radio and television media have rein- forced and extended the same message (Marling 2000; Restad 1995). From the late 1800s, department stores, particularly large central-city stores, featured ever more elabo- rate Christmas displays (Restad 1995; Cross 2000). This environment stimulated a novel and specific type of consumer activity, namely Christmas shopping (Connelly 1999).5 On a gradual basis over the past hundred plus years, Christmas presents have become the defining element of Christmas observance. The Christmas "shopping sea- son," now spanning months, is a make-or-break situation for thousands of retailers, and year-on-year change in aggregate Christmas spending is a widely reported indicator of</page><page sequence="6">506 William H. Redmond national economic vitality. There have been many calls for less emphasis on materialism at Christmas, but there has been no turning back (Waits 1993; Rested 1995). Instead of greater simplicity, commercialism and materialism have come to dominate preparations for Christmas day (Marling 2000). To the twin properties of incessant and insensible in the materialistic drift of Christmas might be added a third: inexorable. Secularity Dating from the mid to late 1800s a second superordinate value orientation, secu- larism, began to exercise an increasing influence on Christmas customs. Christmas has, of course, deep religious roots, and Christmas observance in past times was centered around acts of charity and religious ritual. Up through the mid 1800s, such nonfood Christmas gifts as were given to children often had a devotional purpose. Religious books and Noah's arks were commonly given (Restad 1995; Schmidt 1995). In an increasingly secular society, however, religious aspects gradually became only a vestigial part of Christmas observance (Waits 1993). One formerly religious figure that has been conspicuously co-opted and adapted to the secular Christmas is St. Nicholas. St. Nick, in the form of Santa, was secularized as a jolly old elf in "A Visit From St. Nich- olas" by Clement Moore and was thus popularized as the bearer of gifts. For Victorian era parents, the figure of Santa was helpful in disguising the increasingly commercial ori- gins of increasingly numerous Christmas presents (Cross 2000). Santa's intervention "decontaminated" purchased gifts because he did not use money and did not work for profit (Waits 1993). Over the years Santa has become ubiquitous in advertisements and stores, indicating that the commercial origin of presents is no longer a concern for either parents or children. Spreading Influence While earlier sections of the paper discussed the role of the nonconscious in achiev- ing consistency, the action of conscious desire for change is not to be overlooked. In cases of institutional drift, intergenerational differences in enthusiasm for change may be significant. The direction of change in the subordinate institution often suits the interests of a younger generation and thus receives their encouragement and support. For example, a greater munificence of gifts received by their peers is readily noticed by children and speedily brought to the attention of their parents. The pervasive pull of materialism can also be seen in the spread of certain aspects of Christmas observance beyond Christian households. As early as the late 1800s some Jewish families had adopted Christmas trees to please (or to placate) their children (Restad 1995). Indeed, materialistic and secular aspects of Christmas observance have diffused around the world. Japan has a consumerist Christmas that is without religious referent (Schmidt 1995), and nearly a third of Beijing residents give Christmas presents (Economist 2003).6</page><page sequence="7">Processes of Gradual Institutional Drift 507 The trends of materialism and secularism which began to reshape Christmas obser- vance in the late 1800s have-not abated and continue to be reinforced by retailers, adver- tisers, and entertainment media: "Television has helped Christmas to become an international capitalist festival; television and consumption go hand in hand" (Connelly 1999, 206). Conclusion Change in Christmas observance illustrates basic features of institutional drift: the changes are neither without cause nor without direction but rather reflect the tenor of the times. The associative structure of memory, along with the consistency-seeking nature of the human mind, means that misalignment between superordinate and subor- dinate institutions cannot be long maintained. To most participants the process of adjustment is largely nonconscious. As noted at the outset, there are many kinds of institutional change. Compared with other types of institutional change, gradual drift is marked by substantial nonconscious operation: it is largely insensible. In particular, gradual drift differs from the more planned and intentional approach to change in mid-level institutions such as is caused by the spread of new techniques and technologies (Redmond 2003). However, institutional drift has two aspects in common with the diffusion of mid-level institu- tions. First, emulation does play a role. In the case of Christmas, children who received fewer presents sought to emulate children who received more, while some families out- side the Christian tradition sought to emulate families in the tradition. Second, com- mercial interests act as agents to encourage the spread of new practices. Magazines and department stores had a financial stake in promoting a more materialistic orientation toward Christmas. The role of agency continues to exercise an influence on Christmas observance because the profit potential of a materialistic Christmas continues to prompt the involvement of a large number of commercial interests. Notes 1. These associations are formed by concurrent activation of several networks in the cerebral cor- tex and, once established, lead to continued co-activation (Fuster 1995). 2. Perhaps the most striking work in cognitive consistency involves infants as young as five months, well before socialization has begun. In experiments, infants registered expressions of surprise when shown depictions of an inconsistent situation, specifically of two solid objects occupying the same space (Spelke 1990; Tooby and Cosmides 1992). 3. A majority of cognitive scientists support the notion of domain specificity in cognitive pro- cessing. In other words, cognitive ability has evolved in the form of modular and specialized brain regions instead of a single, generalized capacity for thought (Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994). Some of these evolved, specialized cognitive capabilities involve social relationships such as reciprocity and cooperation (Cosmides and Tooby 1992). Certain of these specialized cognitive capabilities have evolved to operate at a nonconscious level.</page><page sequence="8">508 William H. Redmond 4. Since even related institutions rarely change at a uniform rate, instances of cultural lag and institutional friction are correspondingly common. Often the rate of change in the superordinate institution is itself slow, so that the rate of change in subordinate institutions is correspondingly gradual. Also, adjustment to related institutions may exhibit some lag. 5. Early in the twentieth century, department stores were transformed into "Christmas cathe- drals" in early December with extensive interior and window displays. Christmas shopping has subsequently developed into an activity which is both time consuming and stressful for many (Schmidt 1995). 6. Thorstein Veblen (1914) noted that when the process of borrowing crosses cultural bound- aries, the transfer does not include anthropomorphic or spiritual traits. References Ayres, C. E.
