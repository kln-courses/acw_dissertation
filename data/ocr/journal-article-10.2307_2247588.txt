<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution in Art: as illustrated by the Life-history of Designs. By ALFRED C. HADDON, Professor of Zoology, Royal College of Science, Dublin. London: Walter Scott, 1895. Pp. xviii, 354. PROFESSOR Haddon is one of a growing number of men who are intent on- tracing backwards the metamorphoses of ornament, in order that they may disclose its cause, its origin and its meaning, and because they regard the subject as an essential part of the larger question of the evolution of art. It is an interesting fact that of this band of students those who have been most successful in their search have been biologists. But Professor Haddon is too modest when he declares that he is "neither an artist nor an art-critic, but simply a biologist who has had his</page><page sequence="2">262 CRITICAL NOTICES. attention turned to the subject of decorative art." In this confession he has laid himself open to the thrust of the predatory reviewer, who has not hesitated to reply that " art cannot expect much at the hands of science" (2Fa nchester Guardian). Perhaps science cannot expect much from those who are artists only, or art-critics by profession. For in truth the lore of ornament and of art has already become a science and, like that of organic evolution, requires the patience and the acuteness of a Darwin. Certainly none but a man trained in embryology could have satis- factorily followed the transformations of the "arrow-ornament," found in Torres Straits (p. 22), which originated in a realistic representation of a crocodile, and passed through successive changes, with displaced nostrils, eyes elongated into a panel, limbs lost, and cloacal plate permanently decorated, until a design was evolved that seems purely geometrical. And none but a zoologist could so well have written one of the most interesting chapters of this book, on the application of biological deductions to designs, in which Pro- fessor HaWddon maintainis, though he hardly proves, that the genesis, growth, and decay of any artistic motif are subject to the same laws that govern the evolution of living organisms. In all scientific treatises two things are needful, definitions and a nomenclature. No one can define the meaning of words better than Professor Haddon, yet from the present work prelimninary definition is almost absent. The important word "ornament" is not defined. It is only on the 314th page that we are told that "in patterns the two essential elements are symmnetry and repe- tition," and we are nowhere reminded of the marvellous results of serial arrangement, nor of the fact that symmetry itself is a formi of repetition. He assumes too much knowledge on the part of the general reader. On the other hand his nomenclature is welcome and satisfactory. Its need has long been felt. He divides "pat- terns " inito skeuomorphs and biomorphs, and the latter into phyllomorphs and zoomorphs, of which the anthropomorph is a branch; whilst he adds the term physicomorph to denote a design founded upon a process or a phenomenon (p. 118). A skeuomorph is an embellishment deinonstrably derived from some utilitariarn structural artifice; and the "rope pattern" is a good example of one. A zigzag may be a skeuomorph. In some particular case, as on bronze celts for example, it represents a ligature. But in other cases it may be a zoomorph. Thus Professor Haddon proves that crocodiles' legs (p. 23), the head and beak of a bird (p. 51), snakes (p. 176), the body of alligators (p. 171), the legs of frogs (p. 214), the extended wings of bats (p. 175), and human extremities (p. 271), may all work out at last, under pro- longed artistic treatment, into simple geometrical zigzags. He shews, too, that the zigzag may even be derived from an entire article of womien's clothing (p. 97), and so must be called, in his terminology, a physicomorph; and this designation must also include the zigzags of water and of lightning. On the other hand,</page><page sequence="3">ALFRED C. HADDON: Evol ution in Art. 263 that a zigzag often represents a plant-form, is often a phyllomorph, is easily proved. A number of zigzags, then, may be precisely similar in appear- ance, and yet their origin may be altogether diverse. They may be homologous, as Professor Haddon puts it, but not analogous; and it is highly convenient to be able, by means of a nomenclature, to divide and to classify them. One main purpose of the work is to show how and under what laws the figure of an animal or of a plant passes through those changes that ultimately make it indistinguishable from a skeuo- morph, that render it subservient to decoration, and that reduce it to what were once thought to be primary geonmetrical forms. The realistic animal figure, once recognised, continues to be recognised, no less, the while it undergoes gradual generalisation and simplification, the while it becomes gradually conventionalised. Its origiinal purpose continues to be sufficiently served, for there is no breach in the continuity of observers. It must not be supposed, however, that in effecting this abbre- viation there is any conscious desire on the part of the artificer to " save time and trouble"; such an expenditure would, among "savages," be a pleasurable occupation of mind and body. But, nevertheless, action takes place in lines of least resistance, mentally and physically; and time and trouble are bestowed on nmultiplying resultant motifs, in spreading simpler forms over a widening area, and not at all in elaborating the original. When a zoomorph is to break up into a zigzag or a scroll of a severe type, other factors in the process are the kind of cutting, implement used, the' nature of the material to be embellished, and the particular skeuomorph that happens to dominate the artificer's mind, that is most frequently followed by his eye, and that attracts to itself, as it were, and assimilates all approximate delineations. But sometimes, as in Scandinavian art, the animal figure, in transforming itself into decorative designs, was not sharpened or attenuated or degraded, but rose into magnificent scrolls and swept the ornamental field with curves of rare beauty and dignity. Such an ascent is to be ascribed to the reinforcement of an artistic bent by the confluence of a foreign art-current, by what Professor Haddon calls "cross-fertilisation" (p. 150), as when Scandinavian tendencies were stimulated by a flood of Byzantine influence. In this connection it is not a little odd that those parts of a dissolving zoomorph that longest survive so as to be distinctly recognised are very various. As regards the human figure, it is often the tongue that alone is left, or the legs; with bats, it is the wings extended in flight; with lizards, the foot in the form of a semicircular boss; and with other animals, the mouth or the eye. The reason of this it would be easy to conjecture, but difficult to demonstrate. Attention, expectancy, the near approach to a skeuo- morphic homologue, and the ever-acting need of utility in the object</page><page sequence="4">264 CRITICAL NOTICES. that is decorated, would operate as factors, though not to the exclusion of others. When the zoomorph has been traced to its source it becomes necessary to account for the animal presentment itself. What led the prehistoric cave-dweller to carve the figure of a reindeer on the handle of his flint knife? Why did Hervey Islanders incise upon their paddles the form of a woman? Why is an alligator depicted on the ware of Chiriqui? Professor Haddon sets himself to answer such questions as these. Magic, that must have an imitation of the beings it wishes to control; totemism, that requires a token of kinship and clanship; metempsychosis, that sees bestial forms inhabited by the spirits of deceased men; pride of descent, that carves upon personal posses- sions the features of a tribal ancestor; religion, that finds abstract adoration made easier by the presence of an idol, of a symbol; such as these are the forces that originated the animal image. And in some cases such forces as these originated the vegetal representation also. Mr Goodyear has demonstrated that religion brought the lotus into the lovely art of Egypt, as the symbol of the sun, of life, of fertility, of the multiple soul; and lotus-derivatives, Nyniphsean phyllomorphs, are now ubiquitous in every quarter of the globe. It is however one of the merits of Professor Haddon's work to have shown that ornamental motifs exist that are not lotus-deriva- tives although closely resembling them. There are scrolls and frets that are skeuomorphs of basketry (p. 111); the guilloche is some- times a zoomorph (p. 50), and the sigmoid curve likewise (p. 55); whilst the double scroll that is usually called Myceneean, and that certainly came from the banks of the Nile, has been independently evolved from the eye and beak of the frigate-bird in the " Massim " District (p. 50). The causes that have brought the lotus and the frigate-bird to precisely the same peculiar and beautiful pattern in which no one, without instruction, could discover a trace either of animal or of flower, have begn indicated, but they form part of a great and serious psychological problem. Professor Haddon gives a valuable word of warning (p. 333) to those who interrogate minds of a low order. Careful questioning is absolutely necessary and should never be omitted in seeking for an interpretation of "designs" among the people who use them. Such persons are apt to say not what they know but what they think, or what they imagine would please or satisfy the inquirer. Or they will relate the gloss of a missionary. Familiarity with the growth of eponymic legends must prepare the investigator for a like phan- tasm, " the myth of observation." Professor Haddoin has but little to say on the curious fact that in some civilisations there emerges now and then a love of asym- metry; a subject on which Mr Goodyear is preparing a work. This revolt against symmetry, that startles and refreshes us in Japanese decorative art, that seems to have sprung up like a "sport" in minds saturated with formality, is to be found by those</page><page sequence="5">ALFRED C. HADDON: Evolution in A rt. 265 who look for it widely illustrated'in the Gothic mediawval archi- tecture of the Continent. It is justly observed (p. 201), however, that symmetry may be exhibited in the equal balancing of dissimilar designs. The occurrence of " paired " animal forms in various parts of the world has not yet been explained. It seems that in Torres Straits, in order to mark ownership on certain objects, such as drums and pipes, two precisely similar animal figures are symmetrically disposed with regard to the middle line. Professor Haddon noticed that these paired forms, such as the cassowary, the dugong, the snake, the stingray (p. 17), were also tattooed in duplicate upon women's backs, and were known to be totem animals. He remarks (p. 18) that this pairing strongly recalls the "supporters" of our armorial bearings, and that there is reason to believe that these perpetuate in some instances the totem ancestors of our savage forefathers. There is moreover good reason to believe that the remote progenitors of many peoples practised tattooing. It is pretty certain that those of the Egyptians did so. Now in Egyptian art there was a frequent grouping of animals in pairs, but they were arranged back to back. In Assyria and Greece such coupled anim]als faced each other. Elsewhere, as in our own "lion and unicorn," the anii.nals differ, but yet are symmetrically disposed. It would not be very surprising if it should turn out that this method of grouping originated in a custom of tattooing correspondent surfaces of the human body with the same design, of depicting the totem on each arm or leg, or on each side of the median line of the trunk. No one interested in such subjects as these can neglect Professor Haddon's work. It is too comprehensive to be discussed in a brief notice. It is perhaps more comprehensive than a strictness of preliminary definition would have permitted. It even deals with the origin of the letters of the alphabet. But of this the reader has the advantage. It is especially valuable as containing a large amount of personal observation and original research together with much suggestiveness and ingenuity. For a second edition slips of the pen and printers' errors should be eliminated. Such an expression as " a design may be apparently fairly uniformly distributed" (p. 327) mars an interesting paragraph, but it is more readily perceived by the critic than by the writer. These are insignificant blemishes. All fellow students will be grateful to him for what he has so well achieved. Hy. COLLEY MARCH.</page></plain_text>
