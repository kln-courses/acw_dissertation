I*-ZI") An excavation was carried out in the summer of 1998 at Tel Ya'oz (Tell Ghaza; map ref. NIG 174/650, OIG 124/150), after a bulldozer damaged the site. Tel Ya'oz, situated on a 45 m high kurkar hill on the Mediterranean coast south of Rishon Le-Ziyyon, was surveyed by Moshe Dothan in the 1950s; in the 1980s, Israel Roll of the Tel Aviv University excavated Persian- and Hellenistic-period remains at the site, which have been recently published by Moshe Fisher. In the present excavation, a large Persian period building was discovered on the southwestern slope of the site (Figs. 1-6; Plan 1). The architecture is typical of the Persian period: walls made of fieldstones with regular intervals of well-dressed, ashlar stones (Fig. 3). The building had only one phase; sterile, yellow sand was found immediately below its floors. All the pottery from the building is fragmented and dates to the fifth century BCE (Figs. 7-11). Imported vessels include fragments of Eastern Greek and Attic wares (Fig. 12), but also many daily vessels such as mortaria bowls and various jars (see also Gorzalczany, this volume). Two heads of drinking vessels in the shape of a ram and a lion were found, as well as an almost intact rhyton with an anthropomorphic face (see Ziffer, Kletter and Segal, this volume).
