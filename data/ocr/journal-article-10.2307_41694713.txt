<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIOGRAPHY OF CAITYA By Shruti Pradhan 1 This paper proposes to discuss the relation of the Pali word cetiya to its Sanskrit equivalent caitya. This entails a discussion of the Sanskrit words citi, citya/citya and cayana and also the word smasãna found in the YV Samhitãs, the Brãhmanas, the Šrautasutras and the Grhyasütras and of the Pâli word rhüpa (Sanskrit stüpa) ' Interesting facts emerge when we look into the history of the use of the words cetiya and caitya in the Buddhist and Vedic documents respectively. These facts, I would suggest, are additional evidence to support Asko Parpóla 's thesis about the cultural assimilation of the Rgvedic Aryans and the Dãsas (the pre-Rgvedic Aryans) that took place in the eastern part of India. A discussion of the Purãnic references to caitya and the use of this word as a synonym of devãyatana from the epics onwards would further reinforce this thesis. Before proceeding to discuss the Vedic texts and the Buddhist usage of the word cetiya, let me set forth briefly Parpóla 's thesis so that one may see how my analysis of them supports it. With the help of archaeological, textual and linguistic evidence, Asko Parpóla2 seeks to trace the routes of the Dãsas (pre-Rgvedic Aryans) and the Sauma Aryans (the Rgvedic Aryans) from Iran and South Central Asia to India. While doing so he identifies what he considers • The necessity of a somewhat similar study seems to have been felt by Asko Parpóla, who writes: "The relation of the Vedic citi to the Buddhist stüpa (which is round) and its predecessor, the yaksa caitya .. is a significant problem that deserves closer study.." ("The Pre-Vedic Indian Background of the Šrauta Rituals" in the Agni , edited by F. Staal, Vol. II, Asian Humanities Press, 1983, Vol. II, p. 55, hereinafter: Šrauta Rituals). Something along these lines has been attempted by Romila Thapar {ibid. p. 16). Her interesting, albeit ignorant, speculations are misleading since they betray an inadequate appreciation of the historical depth and philological complexity of cetiya on the one hand, and of caitya , citi and its synonyms in the Vedic literature and the epics on the other. 2 Cp. Asko Parpóla, "The Coming of the Aryans to Iran and India and the Cultural and Ethnic Identity of the Dãsas" in IJDL , XII: 2, pp. 85-229 (1968), hereainfter: Identity of Dãsas.</page><page sequence="2">92 Annals BORI , LXXXIII ( 2002 ) to be specific Dãsa and Sauma Aryan elements and notes the mutual assimilation, fusion or acculturation of the two peoples. The archaeological site Togolok-21 in ancient Margiana has revealed the cult of Soma associated with the Rgvedic Äryans and that of the fire-altar associated with the Dãsas in a fort with three concentric walls which is associated with the Dãsas as can be inferred from the similar ones in Bactria where the element of Soma is absent. He also sees evidence for the fusion of the Dãsas with the people of the southern Indus Valley in the Cemetery-H culture and concludes that the Dãsas must have enterc'J Sind through the southern passes. Further, Parpóla believes that because of the Indus influence (compare their brick-built cities) the Dãsa fire-altar which was a simple affair in Togolok, assumes the form which is later mentioned in the YV Samhitãs as agnicayana (piling up of layers upon layers of bricks to make an altar for fire). They also adopted from the Indus Valley people the star calendar which is so important to the Vedic tradition. What Parpóla calls the second fundamental acculturation took, place in Punjab when these assimilated Dãsas met the Sauma Ãryans who come to Punjab from the Swat Valley. This fusion is attested in the eldest YV Samhitãs which combine two different and originally separate regligious traditions: the Soma cult of the Rgvedic Ãryans, and the fire ritual of the Dãsas involving offerings of ghee and cakes made of gain. Further traces of the Dãsas are seen in the rituals of the Brãhmanas and the Sütras which Parpóla traces to the Vrãtyas of Magadha who constitute ïttw: of the SB (see fn. 19 for my view) and are supposed to be the Dãsas. I shall now proceed to state my case which supports Parpóla 's thesis and elaborate it with the help of detailed textual evidence from Vedic sources. n The earliest use of cetiya occurs in the Mahãparinibbãnasuttc i3 (MPS) which makes a distinction between thüpa and cetiya. While thüpa is "mound erected over the relics of one who is cremated", cetiya is a "tree with an altar as an abode of a devatã (like Y aksa, Näga, Gandharva, Apsaras , but especially Y aksa) . The MPS mentions cetiya-s like Udena, Gotamaka, Cãpãla, Bahuputta, 3 Mahãparinibbãnasutta , Sacred Books of the East , Vol .11, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi , 1 965 . The references to this sutta in the present paper are to its translation in this volume by Rhys Davids. Hereinafter I refer to both the sutta and this volume as MPS. See intr. p. xix for the view that this is the earliest of the sutta- s. The other volumes in the series "Sacred Books of the East" are referred to as SBE.</page><page sequence="3">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 93 Sãrandada, Sattambaka (p.40); Mukutabandhana (p. 124); Ãnanda (p.66). As the names indicate, these cetiya- s are shrines4 dedicated to devatã- s like the Yaksas,5 etc. whose worship was current even in pre-Buddhist times6. The study of the Sanskrit word caitya which occurs in the Vedic tradition reveals some interesting facts. This word was not known to the Rgveda. It is first mentioned in the AsGSu where it is used in two senses, one (1.10.1-8) as as in the MPS 7 and the other(3.5.8) in a remarkably different sense. I shall first discuss the MPS sense which is seen in the following quotation ÎW i Il ^ t fg&amp;WT II 3 Il WTST^faMIl m cHWd 3dd¿^í Ů fWt II V II fïï II mi 3PŤ fpiMï *fl fčM IK II ïlfrm « Il ÍTšRRRT dftd^fafd II ¿ II (The PGSü 3.12 describes a similar ritual without mentioning its name). Though called a yajña accompanied by a homa ,8 it is not a yajña in the Rgvedic sense. The general Rgvedic practice is this: (1) the object of worship, the devatã, is invited to come to the place of worship and asked to occupy a seat (on the barhis) which is close to that of the sacrificer. To that extent, 4 The popular belief is that cetiya is a synonym of thüpa. But its original meaning is a tree- shrine and it was only at a later stage that it became a synonym of stüpa. Childer's Dictionary of Pali Language mentions rukkha cetiya = tree-shrine p. 102. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary mentions the Pali word cetiya (p.625) and gives "sanctuary" or "temple" as its meaning, p.233. Also see Pâli Glossary by Dines Anderson, Vol. 2, p. 97 and Rhys Davids' Dictionary for vanacetya = a shrine in the wood, p. 600. s Malati J. Shendge gives shades of meaning of the Pali yakkha in the Buddhist texts: (a) The Pali commentators of Vimãnavatthu Atthakathã derive it as ¿mRi čftsj (b) rukkhadevatã , J. 3.309; Petavatthu 1 .9 and Petavatthu Atthakathã 5, and (c) the cult of Yakkhas seems to originate from the woods, thus in trees, Petavatthu 2.9 and 4.3 (The Civilized Demons: The Harappans in the Rgveda , Abhinava Publications, Delhi, 1 977 , p . 1 1 6) . The MahãmãyUrividyãrãjm (Journal Asiatique , Vol . V , 1 9 1 5) gives the names of the Yaksas as belonging to various geographical locations spread across the east, north and west India. It thus helps us to see that Yaksa-worship prevailed in these areas. 6 Encyclopaedia of Religion , edited by M. Eliade, hereinafter: ER. See Vol. 2, p. 359 and Vol.10, p. 294. Also see Rhys Davids' Dictionary , p. 272. 7 In her article "The caitya yajña " in JASB , 1974-76, Sindhu S. Dange observes that it is an obscure ritual. She takes the word caitya to refer to the rite of erecting a mound as a monument on the cremated remains of a person, the place of the caitya- rite being gradually taken by the libations offered at the srãddha performed in the house itself. Sindhu Dange 's thesis is fanciful. It is not substantiated by any evidence and lacks in historical perspective. If we look into the history of the word, it becomes clear that it acquired this meaning much later even in the Buddhist tradition. See Section III of this paper. s Compare Haradatta's commentary: ^Tïï WRÍTOhM fPRtS^Tïïïï</page><page sequence="4">94 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) a devatã is only imagined to be present at the place of worship, and (2) the offering is made into the fire located close to the sacrificer. Contrary to this, in the caitya-yajña,( 1) the object of worship, the caitya , is physically present at the place of worship, where the worshipper is required to go, and (2) the offering has thus to be carried ( haret ) to the caitya which is located away from the residence of the worshipper. The latter part of the text of the AsGSü expressly states that the caitya could even be located in another country , that the path could be dangerous (adding that in that case one should carry a weapon), and that one could even be required to cross a river (for which one should carry a raft). Moreover, the baliharana gets precedence over homa. Do not these points of difference indicate that the caitya in the AsGSü has the same connotation as the cetiya of the MPS and that like the latter it might be located anywhere in a town or country side or in a grove adjacent to the town or even beyond a river? Such caitya- s were a common feature of the tribal republics (janapada-s) , as for example, the Makutabandhana cetiya of the Mallas situated outside the city (MPS, p. 1240 or the cetiya- s of the Vajjis in town or country (ibid. p .4). That the caitya-yajña consists of the worship of a vrksadevatã becomes clear from the fact that the bali meant for it is offered through paläsadüta (that is, offered on a leaf) and that the hymn to be recited (V.5.10 =RFIŘ &lt;^h¡ iwiPi I çomPt tjïïFT II ) is addressed to Vanaspati, which primarily means a tree , though it is used secondarily of a sacrificial post in this hymn . The following discussion of the tree-worship in the Rgveda will further confirm the above conclusion that as in the Dãsa tradition, caitya worship in AsGSü too is worship of a tree as an abode of a devatã. For the Rgvedic Ãryans, on the other hand, the tree itself is a devatã. What I mean to say is that in the Dãsa tradition the tree and the devatã exist as separate entities, that there exists a separation, disjunction or dualism between the two. As against this, for the Rgvedic Ãryans there is no separation, disjunction or dualism between the tree and the devatã. Before analyzing the references to tree- worship in the Rgveda , let us be clear about the words used in it for a tree. These are Vrksa and Vanaspati.9 Of these two words, Vanaspati needs some explanation. The primary meaning of vana is "forest" (Vedic Index, Vol.2, p. 241). Vanaspati then means "lord 9 Vedic Index of Names and Subjects , by A . A . Macdonell and A . B . Keith in 2 Vols . , Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1958, hereinafter : Vedic Index. See Vol. 2, pp. 241 and 319.</page><page sequence="5">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography ofCaitya 95 of the forest", and refers to "a tree" (ibid. p. 241). As Griffith states, Vanaspati probably stands for a big or tall tree.10 This meaning is confirmed by III. 8.1 1 and IX .5. 10 which describes Vanaspati (from which a y üpa is fashioned) as having a hundred or a thousand branches and as being green in colour. It is thus to be distinguished from a Vrksa which seems to mean a smaller tree. The places where Vanaspati is referred to as a deified object are the Apri hymns. The word Vanaspati in these hymns stands for a yüpa, the sacrificial post, which only when consecreated becomes a deified object (cf. Griffith's fn . on III .8 . 1 ) . Besides being used in this sense , two of the Âprî hymns (II .37 .3 . and VI.47.27) use Vanaspati in the sense of a ratha which, too, is treated as a deified object. It is thus obvious that the references to Vanaspati in the Âprî hymns are neither to the worship of trees as such nor to trees as abodes of devatã- s as in the Dãsa belief. But there are other hymns which contain a clear reference to tree-worship. Thus at V.41.8 Vanaspati is extolled along with other gods for giving riches. The hymns VII. 34. 23 and VIII .54.4 extol Vanas- pati along with water, wind and mountains, asking them for protection. In VII.34.25 and 56.25 the singer asks irfïïïï: (trees) to accept his prayer and in VII.35.5 to be gracious. The tree worship in these references is quite different from the cult of caitya in the religion of the Dâsas (see fn. 18). The difference lies in the attitudes of the Dãsas and the Rgvedic Äryans towards trees. To the Dãsas, the trees are "abodes of the devatä- s" like the Gandharvas, the Apsarases , the Nãgas and the Y akças . On the other hand, to the Rgvedic Aryans , the Vanaspati and the Vanin themselves are the devatã- s which, like other natural phenomena (rivers, mountains, etc.), evoked awe in the minds of the poets with the result that they sought protection and favours from them.1 1 This attitude is reflected in the plural number in which shows that the poet is addressing "big trees" in general as opposed to a particular tree as an "abode of a devatã " as in the Dãsa tradition. Another point of distinction in the beliefs of the Dãsas and the Rgvedic Aryans is that in the former tradition the exclusiveness of the tree worshipped is marked by a platform of bricks or stones around it. The very word cetiya/ caitya used of such a tree helps one to infer that it is possessed of a platform. 'o The Hymns of the Rgveda, translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, rpt. 1958, hereinafter: Hymns. See foot-notes on RV. 1.13.11; III.4.10 and III.8.1. 1 " Ve die Mythology, A.A. Macdonell, Bombay Education Society's Press, Byculla, Bombay, 1898, p. 154.</page><page sequence="6">96 Annals BORI, LXXXlll ( 2002 ) (caitya is an adjective used as a noun. It is formed from the noun citi or city a, "a pile" which is derived from V ci, to pile up.) There is nothing in the Rgveda to suggest that the tree which was invoked had a platform around it. Moreover, constructing a platform involves knowledge of masonry, something which the Rgvedic Ãryans did not possess. If this view is challenged on the basis of the evidence of the ritual of agnicayana (construction of a brick-altar for fire), it may be pointed out that this ritual is not mentioned in the Rgveda, but appears only in later Vedic literature, beginning with the YV Samhitãs. The concept of an altar for fire as well as the ritual of cayana (piling layers of bricks) connected with it is a Dãsa legacy adopted into their religion by the Rgvedic Aryans (see Section I). A cursory glance at the agnicayana plates (Agni, Vol. I) reveals some Dãsa elements: ( 1 ) The sacrificer dons the "usnisa" only during the consecration. It is discarded during the purchase of Soma (plate 2, pp. 50- 51). (2) During consecration, the sacrificer holds a "stick", wears the "skin of a black antelope" folded over his right arm and wears the niska on his chest with a string round his neck (plate 46, p. 326). These are the items a Vrätya householder is known to don according to TB (17.1 .14). The Rgvedic Aryans were known to spread their offerings in a pit dug into the earth12 which is called vedi/vedi, the fire for oblation being located in a place nearby. This is quite different from the "altar for fire" of the later Vedic which is a platform. It might be argued on the basis of the TS 3. 4. 8 .4-5 (*ï ^ ftčRTT ïïT«ï: MTtfcT SJŠtícT OTTWí: Refait wtâ t 9T*rafcT I ) that caitya- worship existed in the &gt;2 We have the following information on Rgvedic vedi/vedi, "...the oblations, before being consigned to the fire to be conducted to the gods in heaven, are placed for sometime on a litter of sacred grass (barhis) which is spread on the vedi (an oblong shallow excavation somewhat narrowed in the middle" (The Cultural Heritage Of India, The Ramakrishna Mission, Institute of Culture, Calcutta, Rpt. 1982, Vol. I, p.244). For vedi as "an excavated ground under as an altar", also see Vedic Index , Vol.1 , p. 400 under dhisanã. We get the following information from Griffith's (cp. his Hymns) foot-notes on various hymns: barhis is spread on the vedi or altar after having cut off its roots. The libations of Soma juice or oblation of clarified butter is poured on it (1.3.3). The barhis is also spread on the floor of the hall of sacrifice, bedewed with ghee, to serve as a seat for the gods (II. 3 .4). The ground on which the sacrificers sit is also strewn with grass (1.3.3). The place where Agni is enkindled is called dhisnya. It is a lesser or side altar or a heap of earth covered with sand on which the fire is placed (IV .6.3). Also see Plate 4 (Agni, Vol. I, pp. 126-127) where a Rgvedic altar is described as a flat piece of ground demarcated ritually, being prepared by losing the soil, the oblations being offered into the fire installed on it.</page><page sequence="7">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 97 Rgvedic tradition also. No doubt it is similar to the Dãsa belief in a "tree as an abode of a devatã ."13 But, significantly, the TS is a YV Samhitã. And the YV Sarhhitãs are the compositions of those Aryans who had got fused with the Dãsas in the Punjab (see section I) . Therefore the reference in the TS, in fact, constitutes additional evidence supporting Parpóla 's thesis of the second acculturation of the Rgvedic Aryans in the Punjab. Thus, like the ritual of agnicayana, the cult of caitya- worship , too , finds a place in the compositions of the Dãsaised Rgvedic Aryans . It might be added that the non-mention of the word caitya in the TS does not go against this. We have a parallel instance in the ŠYV-MS which, in spite of its elaborate treatment of the Dãsa ritual of agnicayana (adhyãyas 11-18, 27) and its reference to the Dãsa practice of erecting a šmašana (adhyãya 35), does not have words for them. Nor does the reference to a sacrifice or to a Vanaspati in TS (5 .54 .3 and 2.1.5) disprove my thesis . In fact , these references to two types of tree- worship, namely , tree as an abode of a devatã and tree itself as a devatã, in a single text confirm the acculturation thesis! Coming back to the reference to caitya-yajña in the ÄsGSü, the latter quotes a hymn (V.5.10) addressed to Vanaspati in this context. But this does not prove that the caity-yajña described here originated in the Rgvedic tradition . The word Vanaspati in this hymn denotes a yüpa and not a tree. It should be remembered that it is a common practice in the later Vedic texts to quote the hymns which have only a verbal similarity with the subject they are discussing, perhaps to give the impression of authenticity to the practices mentioned. Rhys Davids, referring to the "...character of the verses given in the Grhyasütras which had to be repeated at the performance of the different ceremonies...", states that "...some of these verses indeed are old Vedic verses, but we have no proof that they were composed for the purpose of the Grhya ceremonies, and the connection in which we find them in the Rgveda proves rather the contrary" ( SBE , vol. 30, pt. 2, Introduction, p. x.). The conclusion is thus inevitable that the Rgvedic Äryans during their migration into India i3 The Dãsas, who came to the Indus Valley c. 2000 B.C., borrowed the practice of caitya- worship among others like Yoga, Šaivism, the cult of mother goddess, etc. from the Indus religion. Artefacts were discovered in the Indus Valley which suggest ta/fva-worship ( Identity of Dãsas, p. 92). They picture " ...goddess of Y aksinl type beside a Ficus religiosa or plants emerging from goddess's genital organ" (ER, vol. 15, p.245). Parpóla describes one of the Indus seals thus: " ...a human head has been placed upon a dais that stands beneath a sacred fig tree inhabited by an anthropomorphic deity... The presence of a kneeling priest..." ( Šrauta Rituals, p. 57). Also seé "Indus Script and Language" by S. R. Rao in ABORI, 61(1980): the veneration of a pippala tree is one of the elements of the Indus religion (p. 173).</page><page sequence="8">98 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) incorporated some of the practices of the Däsas (Asuras)14 amongst which caitya- worship is one . These Däsas , as mentioned earlier, were the pre-Rgvedic Aryans (see section I). This meaning of caitya in the AsGSü finds support from another direction. It is obvious that this text gets its name from Ašvala, the founder of the Asvalãyana school, who appears to have been the same as Ašvala, the hotr of king Janaka of V ideha (ŠB 1 4 .6 . 1 .4) 1 5 , and who seems to have migrated from Kosala to Videha. It is significant that an Ãávalãyana (a descendent of Ãávala) is mentioned in the PU (3.1) as a Kosalan, which shows that the progenitor, Ašvala, of this family originally hailed from Kosala and served as a hotr of king Janaka, who is called a "Vaideha" in SB (14.6.10.1 and 14.6.1 1 .6) which makes him a Däsa as the Videhas were a Dãsa tribe. That a Rgvedic Ašvala (the Šrauta- and the Grhya-sütras of this school are affiliated to the Rgveda ) was a priest of a Dãsa king, Janaka, is supported by SB 16.6.2.1 where we have other Rgvedic priests, Švetaketu, Yajñavalkya and Somašusma who encountered Janaka while travelling around. This proves the proximity of Ašvala to the east inhabited by the Dãsas , which further explains how the Dãsa practice of caitya- worship figures in the Grhyasütras of his school. As stated earlier, the ÃÉGSã at 3.5.8 (àîwfcïï w Trai ¿imRmi mRííJISÍ ïïfcPïH rfai ëffa^i) uses the word caitya in a sense remarkably different from that of "a tree shrine". A discussion of this passage is necessary in view of the fact that though some later variations of the ÁšGSíi understand it correctly as meaning "yüpa connected with a fire-altar (citi, citya or cit)", there are others ( BDSü and ST quoted in Bhattadeva's PrãPra) i* Besides caitya- worship, another Dãsa practice adopted in the school of Ašvala is that of throwing away the cremation fire of a Guru at the cross-roads ( ÃíGSú 4.7.3). This reminds us of a similar practice of erecting a mound at the cross-roads over the bones and ashes of a Cakravartin. It was followed in the case of the Buddha's remains also (MPS, p. 92). Also see ER: "The interment of the remains of kings and heroes in burial mounds was a well-established practice in pre-Buddhist India", Vol. 2 , p.325 . Thus what was true of kings and heroes of tribal communities was also true of religious teachers, first in the Vedic tradition (ÁšGSi Î) and later in Buddhist. Let me summarise Robert Knox: In Ceylon, persons of inferior quality are interred in some convenient places in the woods. But persons of greater quality are burned. The ordinary Bhikkhus or Upäsakas are buried and no stûpa is erected (Robert Knox quoted by Rhys Davids, MPS , Intr.pp. xxxix-x 1 ). (Also see Parpola's Identity of Dãsas for the other elements of the Dãsa religion in the Vedic religion.). is The reference to SB upto 14.3.2.31 are to its edition in Sacred Books of the East series. For the rest, see ŠB ed. By A. Weber, Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series no. 96, Varanasi, 1964.</page><page sequence="9">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 99 which, in addition to yüpa, mention a caitya-vrkša in the list of things which one is prohibited from touching.16 It needs to be understood that the latter cannot be confused with "a tree-shrine"17 as the context of expiation makes it clear that caitya vrkša herein is a tree "connected with citi or citya (a funeral pyre)" and thus means a tree connected with the place of cremation. Coming to the variations of the text on ÁšGSú, works like GGSi 7 (fà^qWwfa...etc, 3.3.34), KhGSü (Ri ^ ...3.5.35) and HGSü (ïï {¿M ¿I ¿¡M Mftiyo4ìd..etc.) correctly understand ÄsGSü as referring to the "sacrificial post connected with the fire-altar". This meaning becomes clear from the commentary of Haradatta and Nãrãyana (&lt;3IÍH^¿HWFr ^R) on the text of ÄsGSü. The HGSü alone explains why touching caitya-yupa is a sin. This is supported by what MS (3.9.4) says: ^ t WFT (for íjo41d=MI^&lt;¡IM see commentary on HGSü) d^HI^MÌ I But the MGSü (-3#^ ïïT RlidHI&lt;ì^ S^TTïï ïïT ïï^è^f ^qfwèïï...etc. 1 .3.4) has misunderstood the text of ÁšGSú. This lapse on its part was due to its misconstruing vã in ÄsGSü with the result that it took vã as laying down an option between and Of these two alternatives means -3#^ MçPT, which he connects with aTRtl^T supplied by him . This is supported by SB (9.2.1 .2-3) which states that a mantra is recited while climbing the altar. The recitation of a mantra suggests that adhirohana in itself is a rite and if one does not recite it, it would be a sin requiring expiation. The SB elsewhere (9.5.2.1) states: 3T«I 1 č|T RbRl^RdcbHNsllsfô êfòd14âl ïrt f «fr (Tr. "And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble or to stumble or what not", SBE, vol. 43 p.274), which means that stumbling inadvertently on to the altar is also a sin. The second alternative vi^^l is explained by MGSü as This shows that " caitya " means either a "fire-altar" or a "cemetrey where corpses are burnt" (equivalent to «ïn^prSïïSTFT of ÄsGSü 4.1.10). All this is unwarranted. It is likely that the rendering of caitya as smasãna in MGSü leads texts like BDSü and ST to include caitya-vrksa in the list of things touching which is WeisMHJ 5lléiu|«4«=ll I BDSü 1.6.9.5. -HÌHÌc|sb4ì I snSFïï: ^čIT I I ST quoted by PrãPra, p.l 10. i7 History of Dharmasãtra by Kane, (hereinafter : ti US).

Whatever the reason for this inclusion, the caitya-vrkša is something profane since the context is that of expiation for touching prohibited objects. This is confirmed by the other items in the list like Cándala and Somavikrayin or Vedavikraya. That it refers to "a tree connected with the place of cremation" is supported by the following: "Aparãrka (pp. 885-886) quotes a long passage from the BrahmaPu which states that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and water and that a puskaraka tree should be planted there or a structure should be built over it" (HDS, Vol. IV, p. 255). The BdP (3.7.405) mentions a caitya-vrksa and VP (3.12.13) a caitya-taru as associated with the Pisãcas, thereby suggesting their unholy character. The above discussion of the reference to caitya in the ÄsGSü proves that it has only a single reference to caitya-yajña and that the latter is not included in any of the subsequent Brahmanical texts (the Purãnas being an exception, see section IV). This is as it should be if one takes into consideration Asvala's proximity to the east which made him include in his Grhyasütras caitya- worship, an important element18 of the religion of the Prãcya Asuras.19 The •s That caitya- worship was an important element of the Prãcya-religion is proved by the fact that it prevailed even in historic times or the time of the Buddha. Let us remember that the Buddha tells Ananada that the Vajjis will survive the attack " ... so long as they honour and esteem, and revere and support the Vajjis shrines in town or country. ..." (MPS, p. 4). The Pali word here for "shrines" is cetiyãni cetiyãni , which Sum. Vil. explains as Yakkha- cetiyãni " (MPS, p. 4, fn. 4). is From the information given by B. C. Law regarding places like Kaší, Kosala, Videha and Magadha and the tribes of the Šaky as , V idehas , Mallas , Jñatrkas and Licchavís it is possible to infer that they were the Dãsas. They are known to have been caitya- worshippers, not only in pre-Buddhist times but even twenty eight years after Buddha's death. See his Tribes in Ancient india by R. Choudhary, Poona, Bhandarkar Oriental Series, No. 4, 1973. The tribes mentioned above are called Vrãtyas in the later Vedic texts and represent an earlier swarm of the Aryans. The regions mentioned above were a centre of Vrãtya culture (see The Vrãtyas in Ancient India by R. Choudhary Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, V aranasi , 1 964 , pp . 1 7 , 25-29 , (hereinafter: VAI ) . We may therefore conclude that the 3TRj4: îiïSïï: of the SB (13.8.1 .5) are the same as these tribes who were also called Vrãtyas, and the Prãcya country included the regions of Kaší (¿£.13.5.4.19), Kosala (ŠB. 13.5.4.4) and Videha (ŠB. 1 .4.1 .lOff) during the time of the ŠB. Magadha became part of the Prãcya in the post-Sütra period. Modern researches based on archaeology (Identity of Dãsas, p. 168), ethnography (Šrauta Rituals , pp. 46-55 and Identity of Dãsas, pp. 168-175), linguistics (Chatterji's The Origin and Development of the Bengali Language, pt. I, Rupa and Co., Calcutta, 1985, pp. 40-55, hereinafter: ODBL) and textual evidence (Identity of Dãsas, pp. 168-175) also identify the Vratyas with the pre-Rgvedic Äryans. The ŠYV-MS (30.8.34) states that a Vrãtya is dear to the Gandharvas and the Apsarases, who according to TS (3.4.8.4-5) have "trees as their abodes", which is a Dãsa belief. Also cf. AV. 14.2.9.</page><page sequence="11">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography ofCaitya 101 other Sutras, far removed from Ašvala in time and place, could have had an aversion to this Dãsa practice. Hence a cursory mention of it in some late works (for example, Yãjnavalkya Smrti, 1.133). Thus the inclusion in the AšGSú of caifya-worship that occupied a central position in the religion of the Dãsas, and the fact that Ašvala, a Rgvedic Aryan, was a Hotr of a Dãsa king Janaka prove what Parpóla describes as the third acculturation of the Rgvedic Aryans in the east after the second one in Punjab. Let me explain what "third acculturation" means. It is likely that when the Dãsas reached Punjab, some of them stayed back and later got assimilated with the Rgvedic Aryans when they reached there. Others migrated to the east. They took a route which ran along the northern mountains from Gandhãra to Assam. The adjective vipatha (fcrfcrsi ¡fföj TO 'l^ícl ffïï) used of their chariot (TB 1 7 . 1 . 1 4) suggests that they moved along rugged mountatious roads . Whereas the Madhyadeša was the centre of the orthodox cult, beyond it existed the outer circle of the Vrãtyas (the Dãsas) where the Dãsa religion flourished independently . According to Parpóla, the Dãsa region comprises the Vãhlikas and the Madras (N. Punjab), Uttaramadra and Uttarakuru (North of Punjab), Kãsí, Kosala (Oudh) associated with the Šakyas and the Mallas, Videha (N. Bihar) associated with the Licchavis, Videhas and Jñatrkas, Magadha (Bihar), Bengal and Assam.20 The Rgvedic Aryans, on the other hand, took the lower route, which is indicated by the following important elements in the legend of Videgha Mãthava (SB 1 .4.1 .10-19) concerning the eastward migration of the Rgvedic Aryans: (a) Mãthava was on the river Sarasvati. (b) Agni went burning along the earth towards the east, (c) He burnt all rivers but did not burn the Sadänira. (d) The Brahmins did not cross it in former times, (e) Agni asked Mãthava to reside to the east of the river Sadãníra. (f) The river forms a boundary between Kosala and Videha. (g) It did not dry even in summer. According to Weber "this legend distinguishes three successive stages of the eastward migration of the Brahmanical Hindus" (SBE, Vol. 12, p. 104, fn. 1). They were first on the Sarasvatï (East Punjab) and proceeded eastward till they reached the Sadãnírã. The references to the Gangã and the Y amunã (ŠB kãndas 1-5 and 11-13) suggest that the brahmins first reached the Kuru-Pañcála tract (Madhyadeša) between 2o Identity of Dãsas, p. 174. Also VAI, pp.2 1 ,23 and 25.</page><page sequence="12">102 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) these two rivers and then Kãsi-Kosala (SB 13.5.4.) where the Däsa tribes of the Šákyas and the Mallas already lived. (Kosala is bound by the Sadãnirã in the east). The eastward migration of the Aryans was stranded for quite some time as the Sadãnirã, "ever filled with water", did not dry even in summer. Finally, they managed to cross it and enter Videha. Thus the Prãcya of the SB includes Kãsí-Kosala-Videha but not Magadha. The remnants of the Dãsa element in Kosala are also noticed in the following peculiarities: (1) the phonetic peculiarity of the prefix Gotama added to the name Rahugana, (2) (PU 1.1) š instead of s in Kaušalya. One may therefore conclude that though they took different routes, the Rgvedic Aryans of the Madhyadeša did every now and then come in contact with the Dãsas. This is further confirmed by the fact that the latter found the Rgvedic Äryans deficient in certain details of sacrifice (SB 11.4.2.17-20). I may point out that the later Vedic texts furnish further evidence of the fusion of the Rgvedic Aryans and the Dãsas: (a) At 1 .4.1 .17 the SB reads ïïïsraT: The legend of Mãthava (ŠB 1 .4. 1 ), who originally came from the west (see point 'a' above), states that he entered Videgha from Kosala. Therefore both the people of Kosala to which he belonged before crossing the river Sadãnirã and those of Videha which he entered are called "JTTsraT:" after him. (b) Mãthava had Videgha, the name of the tribe of the Videghas , prefixed to his name after he entered Videha. Mãthava, therefore, seems to have come from the west as the legend indicates. (c) Similarly, the name Rãhugana of Mãthava 's priest seems to have Gotama prefixed to it after he came in contact with the Dãsas, whether in Kosala or Videha. Gotama appears to be a form of address employed by the Dãsas (cf. ŠB 1 1 .4.13-8. Also at BÃU 3.1 Gandharva, a spirit worshipped by the Dãsas, uses the term Gotama in the same manner.) (d) A portion of the genealogical table of priests and their pupils in SB (14.9.4.3 , the same at BÄU 6.5) runs as follows: Uddãlaka Aruni was a teacher of Yãjfiavalkya, the latter of Asuri, Asuri of Asurãyana, who in turn was a teacher of Prãsniputra Asurivãsin. At one point it mentions Yãjfiavalkya (a Rgvedic Brahmin of Madhyadesa-Kurupaficãla, cf. BÄU 3.1) as a teacher of Asuri, who as his name suggests, must have been a Prãcya. How did Yãjfiavalkya, a man from Kurupaficala, become the teacher of a Prãcya? (The point 'f below seeks to answer this question.)</page><page sequence="13">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 103 (e) The genealogical table also shows that the PU, so called after Prãsniputra Asurivãsin, is a document of the Asuras (Dãsas) composed in the east. It is therefore likely that the Atharaveda, to which it is assigned (VAI, pp.103 and 150) was also composed in the east (VAI, pp. 32 and 144), and later appropriated by the Rgvedic Aryans. (f) Yajñavalkya is described as learning the science of sacrifice from Janaka (a Dãsa) after coming to Videha (ŠB 11.6.2.4-10). He was taught adhyãtmayoga by Hiranyanãbha ( BhP 9.12.3-4), a Kausalyã (PU 6.1). This new "Dãsaised" Rgvedic Aryan, now belonging to Videha, was competent to teach Asuri, a Prãcya, the science of sacrifice (SB 14.9.4:3)! Uddãlaka of Kurupañcála, who went to the northern country (i.e. Uttarakuru, which was inhabited by the Dãsas, see above), was taught by a Dãsa named Svaidãyana (ŠB 1 1 .4.1). He was also taugh by a Gandharva named Kabandha Ãtharvana (BAU 3.7) in Madra (inhabited by the Dãsas, see above). That this Gandharva was a Dãsa is proved by the fact that Gandharva is a tree-devatã.whose worship , prevailing among the Dãsas, was taken over by the Rgvedic Aryans as the TS (3.4.8.4-5) shows. We have one more example of a Grhapati (head of the Vrãtyas i.e. the Dãsas, with priestly function) called Ayasthüna, who taught áaulvãyana (áaulbãyana in BAU 4.1), who must have been a Rgvedic Aryan (SB 1 1 .4 .2 . 1 7 -20) . The latter was later appointed as an Adhvaryu by the Dãsas . The SB also says that only one who has full knowledge of sacrifice should be made an Adhvaryu and not one who does not know it (11.4.2.17-20). In all these case the Dãsas found the Rgvedic Brãhmana priests deficient in their knowledge of yajña and taught them its finer details. T o come back to the caitya-yajña in ÃsGSã after the above unavoidable "digression". The mention of the word caitya for a tree-shrine in ÄsGSü, a term semantically and phonetically similar to the cetiya of the Dãsas, suggests the possibility that Ãsvala took the term from the language of the Dãsas21 and 2i S. K. Chatterji on the basis of the data on the language of the Prãcyas (Kãsi, Kosala and Videha) concludes that all the speakers of the Aryan language were not Vedic. The Dãsarãjfia war (/řV.VII.18) shows that there were non-Rgvedic Aryans and non-Aryans besides Rgvedic Ãryans. Some of the non-Rgvedic Ãryans preceded the Rgvedic Aryans in the east. It is among them that some distinct phonetic habits were manifested. As against this, the language of the Udîcya people was acknowledge to have the proper form of Aryan speech. Thus the Sãnkhãyana Brãhmana or the Kausitaki Brãhmana (7.6) states: (TWT^ÍTHTT ŘÍ9T MslldcKI cTPJIJÏÏ, čpí ßlf&amp;sj ^ ÎI3 ® TčSfrí ČW čIT ^fcT I . Contrasted with this purity of the language of the north-west was the "debased" speech of the east. The TB (17.4) thus speaks of the Vrãtyas, whom it admits to be speakers of an Aryan language: dtjOTtwiw and orétfeïï ítfíHd^m qçRt. (Continued on the next page)</page><page sequence="14">104 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) "Sanskritised it as caitya I shall explore this in the next section. It is clear so far from my analysis of the Rgvedic texts and also the later Sarhhitã texts, ( Continued from p. 103) Chatterji quotes Weber's explanation of the first statement from the TB: it "probably refers to Prakritic, dialectic differences, to the assimilation of groups of consonants and similar changes peculiar to Prakrit vernaculars", and concludes that as early as 800 B.C. we have the oldest contemporary notices of Prakrit habit of speech in the east in India noticed by the people of the mid-land or the north-west ( ODBL , pp . 40-55) . I would call this language " Vrãtya Prakrit". Compare the word slM4/sllt|¿ OTV9T for old Sindhi (On the Development of Middle Indo- Aryan, S. K.Chatterjee, Sanskrit College, 1983, p.49). The words ^jçiõrra": (jRV.l. 174.2; V.29 and 32.8, VII.6.3 and 18.13, and X.23.5), (X.23.5) and OTTO: (X.23.5) are useďin the Rgveda to refer to the speech of the Dasyus/Däsas. These Rgvedic Ãryan notices of the dialect of the Dãsas (who spoke an Aryan tongue related to that of the Rgvedic Aryans) indicate that even during tjie composition of the Rgveda , the different character of the Dãsa speech was noticeable. It does not appear that the language of the Dãsas was entirely different from that of the Rgvedic Aryans*. If it were, they would have used different expressions to describe it. gu, ftr and ^prefixed to ^ indicate distortion of their own language. Thus tjst to hurt) indicates that the Dãsa speech hurt the ears of the listener i.e. it was broken, fcf suggests that it was changed or improper, and 3T (which becomes 3R before vowels) shows that it was "depreciated". (For these meanings see The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Apte, hereinafter: Apte). This broken, changed and depreciated form of the Aryan language was the language of the Dãsas. Hence the above quoted statements of the TB. Parpóla states that "the dialectical features later characteristic of the Mâgadhï might have started already when the Dãsas were entering India" (Identity of Dãsas , p. 1 84) The SB (3 .2. 1 .24) describes the speech of the Asuras as viMÍ^çiiw and them as on the basis of their crying | when, with their speech gone towards (OTTrRTcRT:) the gods, they were vanquished. The word vinfaçliw indicates that the Devas (Rgvedic Aryans) found their speech "primitive" (see Apte for this meaning of Sïïfïï, i.e. unefined, substandard as in the case of that of the lower castes today. According to Patañjali (1.1.1) where his reading is , it is an Asura pronunciation of | . The is characteristic of Prãcya-speech. The same portion of the ŠB earlier (sec. 23) tells us that the Devas "having got speech over to their side, enveloped her in fire, destroyed her and then made her their own". Thjs may indicate the emergence of new "refined" forms of words borrowed by the Rgvedic Aryans from the Dãsas. The borrowed words were "destroyed", that is, replaced with new Sanskritised (refined as opposed to viMÍ^çtlw) forms , based , of course , on analogous 4. words in the language of the Rgvedic Aryans (thus cetiya^aitya , which was known to both the languages). Such words seem to follow certain phonetic regularities which later become the rules of conversion of Prakrit to Sanskrit and vice versa. The above data supports what Chatterjee says: The Dãsas spoke the source language of the later Old Magadhi and old Ardhamagadhi, both of which can be called Prãcya languages (ODBL, pp. 54-59). I may quote in support of my argument what Kenneth R. Norman says: "It is very likely that there was one dialect which turned all -r- and -/- sounds into -/-, and had the nominative singular of a-stem in - e - and also turned all three sibilants into š . The speakers of this dialect moved to the east of India, and there is evidence that by historical times this dialect was being used in Magadha" ("Dialect Variation in Old and Middle Indo-Aryan", in Indian Philology and South Asian Studies , ed. by G . Erdosy, Berline, De Gruyter, 1995, p. 280, hereinafter: Dialect Variation). The peculiarities noted here are noticed in Asoka's eastern inscription (Pâli Language by T. Y. Elizarenkova and V. N. Toporov, Nauka Publishing House, Moscow 1976, p. 19).</page><page sequence="15">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 105 and a close study of the relevant texts from the ŠB that the caitya- worship was derived from a non-Rgvedic source which can at present be traced as far back as the religion of the Dãsas and the Indus Valley. However, the different meanings of caitya and cetiya at various times in the Vedic and Buddhist traditions present a problem to which I shall try and address myself in the next section. m The word cetiya came to be used as a synonym of thüpa (sepulchral mound) in the later Buddhist tradition. Likewise, in the Vedic tradition the Sanskrit word caitya came to be used in the funerary context. Though we come across the word caitya in its original meaning of "a tree-shrine" in the Smrti works and the epics and the classical Sanskrit literature, the later ritualistic Vedic texts with the exception of the ÄsGSü, use it as an adjective meaning "connected with cit, citi, citya." The latter along with cayana are used in a variety of senses,22 though they were originally used of a fire altar (literally, "piling" of bricks) constructed around the ritualistic fire. Gradually these words came to be used of a sepulchral mound in the Vedic tradition which earlier had the word šmašana only for it. This latter word was used in it from the time of the YV Samhitãs. It was during the period of the Šrautasutras that the words citi, etc. were used frequently of a sepulchral mound though smasãna also was used. This happened, probably, because šmašana had acquired the new connotation of "cemetery," as is evident from the ÄsGSü (cf. 4.1.10), which specifies its use by prefixing "ãdahana" to it. The word šmašana, as will be shown later, seems to have been borrowed by the Rgvedic Aryans from the 22 The words citi, cit, cayana/caya, citya! city akal city ã, which are used in the senses of (1) fire altar, (2) sepulchral mound and (3) a funeral pyre, are derived from ci , to pile up. Thus the fire-altar is a pile of bricks , the mound is a pile of bricks or clods of earth , and the funeral pyre is a pile of fuel. The context helps us to determine in which of the above senses the word is used. The words used for fire-altar are: (a) citi in KKS, KãS, MS, SB, SäSü and ÄsGSü (b) citya / citya/agnicitya in KKS, TS, MS, SB and ÄsSSü (c) agni in ŠYV-MS in the section on agnicayana, agni-vedi in KKS, ŠB, ÄpSSü and ÄsGSü, (d) cit in MS. The words used for sepulchral mound are: (a) citi in SB and SSSü, (b) cityaka in SäSSü, (c) cayana in SSSü and, (d) cit : in BSSü , (e) BPSü , In addition to these, we have the word smasäna in TS, SS, Paithinasï Sarhhitã, ŠB and later in the Šrauta-Grhya-and Dharmasütras. The words used for funeral pyre are: (a) citi in SB, SäSSü, ÄsGSü and MGSü' (b) cayana in SSSü and BPSü. Besides, the word smasãna , cit is used of (a) a smasãna- shaped fire-altar in MS, TS, KãS and KKS and (b) a sepulchral mound in MS and BSSü. The word smasãna is used of a "site of cremation" in ÄsGSü and MGSü.</page><page sequence="16">106 Annals BORI, LKXXIII ( 2002 ) Dãsas along with the practice of erecting mounds on the site of post-cremation burial of bones. That this was a Däsa custom is proved by the fact that the Budhist practice of erecting thüpa-s, and the mode of worshipping them, according to the MPS (pp. 92-95) were based on the practice prevalent among the tribes,23 who were the Dãsas or the Asuras settled in the east (see fn. 19). It is significant that the Buddhist thüpa-s. like those of the Dãsas (Asura-s), were round (cp. SB 13.8.1 .5). The Rgvedic Ãryans did not have this practice before coming in contact with the Dãsas. The references to it in the Rgveda (X. 18.4, 12 and 18) are explicable in view of the Rgvedic Ãryans passing through the Swat Valley24 before entering India. The Rgvedic references are, then, to the practice prevalent there. The very fact that the Rgvedic poet uses a variety of words like parvata, prthivi, loga, sthünä and mitah but never the Dãsa term smasãna for mound indicates that the language of the Rgvedic Aryans did not have a definite term for it. This further suggests that the practice 23 The mode of "honouring" the mound drew upon an ancient formulation of worship, the Yaksa-cult of pre-Buddhist times. The pracitiöner offered flowers, incense, perfumes and sometimes music, buring lamps, decorative pieces of cloth, banners and umbrellas. (£7?, vol. 12, p. 85). SSSü (29.1 .26-29) and BPSü (1 .17.8) refer to playing music, beating drums, dancing and singing during the funeral as well as while erecting relic-mounds. Also cp. Chãndogya-up anisad (8.8.5) which refers to a similar practice of the Asuras: $T fŘ cW}hI&lt;M&gt;MÍCI *RT%. Thus both the Buddhists and the Rgvedic people seem to have adopted a Dãsa practice. 24 The hyms of the Rgveda record events that took place outside India also. Parpóla (see section I) refers to various regions where the two peoples encountered each other. The phonetic data prove that a part of the fights of the Rgvedic Aryans with the Dãsas took place in east Iran. See, for example, RV.1.93A and VI .61 .1-3 ( Identity of Dãsas, pp. 126- 127). Ancient Margiana (Kelleli, Taip, Gonur and Togolok) is another region where they met. The Togolok-21 fort with three concentric walls is associated with the Dãsas as is clear from south Bactrian forts (Dashly-3 level). The latter come close to the Dãsa forts described in the Rgveda (ibid. pp. 146-148). The fights between the Dãsas and the Rgvedic Ãryans took place in Southern Bactria (N. Afghanistan) also as is clear from the fact that the hymn (X.75.6) which described the fight mentions the tributaries of the Indus starting from north -Trstãmã, Susartu , Rasã (Amu Darya) , Š veti, Kubhã (Kabul) , Gomatî (Gomal) , Mehatnu and Krumu (Kurram). Also cp. RV. V.53.9. The Panis (Dãsas) lived on the far side of the Rasã as mentioned at RV. X. 108. 1-2. This is confirmed by JB 2.440-442. The Rasã is in the region of the Hindukush (Identity of Dãsas, pp. 1 14-1 15). The Rgveda also reflects the Swat Valley culture which is an assemblage of the cultures of the Indus Valley, the Dãsas, the Sauma Aryans, and the Iranians. This is confirmed by the fact that the cemeteries here display evidence of post-cremation, complete flexed inhumation, and fractional burials (after cremation) at the same time (ibid. pp. ' 52- 157). This should explain a variety of funeral practices in the "so-called" funeral hymns of the Rgveda , which seem to be a conglomeration of stray verses describing the various funeral practices seen by the Sauma Aryans in the Swat Valley (and revealed in the excavations there a few decades ago).</page><page sequence="17">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 107 did not prevail among the people to whom the poet belonged, and that the references to it are based on hearsay. It is later mentioned in the Samhitãs of the KYV (TS, MS, KãS, KKS and SS) and the word used in them is smasãna. Though the ŠYV-MS does not use it, the practice was recognized, for there the istãkã- s are desired to bring "sam" to the dead (35.8.1). Later the practice along with the word appears in the SB of the Mãdhyandina school where it is described elaborately. The ŠB (13.8.3.110 indicates that the practice was followed in the case of all the varnas, including women. In view of this, therefore, the directions regarding the erection of a mound given at SB 13. 8.1- 4 are by no means intended to apply only to one who has performed the Sarvamedha (discussed in the portion immediately preceding this) or to an Agnicit but also refer to others. The statement at 13.8.1.5. referring to the square burial mounds of godly people has to be interpreted in the light of 13.8.3-1 1 (mounds are built for all the varnas, including women) as well as 13.8.4-1 1 . The gist of the latter statement is that in the case of one who has not built the fire-altar, the procedure described at 13.8.1-4 for all is to be followed, except that the shape is not like that of a fire-altar, that is, it is not square. Thus there was no difference in the shape of the mounds among the Rgvedic and pre-Rgvedic Aryans (or the Asuras), the Agnicit along being an exception. The reason for the square shape of the mound of an Agnicit is mentioned at 13.8.1-17. The gist of this passage is: when an Agnicit dies, unless an altar-shaped tomb is built for him, the benefits of his performing the ritual of agnicayana are not secured by him. Therefore the shape of the mound must be that of the altar. The non-occurrence of a definite term smasãna for a mound in the Rgveda, and its occurrence in the later Vedic literature, that is, the Samhitãs of the KYV, indicate that not only the practice but even the word for it was borrowed by the Rgvedic Aryans from the Dãsas with whom, as we have seen, they got assimilated in the Punjab where the oldest YV Samhitãs were composed (see Section I). It is worth mentioning in this context that the Rgvedic tradition does not use the word stüpa for a mound (as did the Buddhists later, though both borrowed the practice from the Dãsas/tribes), inspite of the word being known in that tradition to mean "a dome-shaped mass."25 implying thereby . 25 The word stüpa occurring at RV. I.24.7ab and VII. 2. led is wrongly translated by western scholars as "stem" and "column" respectively. In the earlier reference the poet draws a contrast between the earthly vana with its innumerable trees and the sky with its innumerable heavenly bodies. The top expanse (3&gt;î4 of the forest looks like an open umbrella, (Continued on the next page)</page><page sequence="18">108 Annals BORI , LXXXIII ( 2002 ) a round shape. The reason for borrowing the term smasãna could be that while the word stupa indicated a "round shape" only, the word smasãna could be used of the mounds of the Rgvedic Aryans which were both square and round as stated earlier. Though the "word smasãna is not found in the Rgveda ", there is a "single reference to smasã in it" (X. 105.1) which means a "ridge."26 1 would suggest that the Rgvedic smasã is semantically congate with " sünV' which G. Morgenstierne27 states is the Kafir type of coffin raised above the ground (just like a ímaM=ridge). Now " sum " is etymologically related to Pâli susãna (cemetery) and Sindhi "son-a"28 since all the three are phonetically and semantically cognate. The word smasãnã appears to be a Sanskritisation of susãna and the latter could be a reflex of Kafir "sumT."29 That susãna like süni originally meant a "mound" is confirmed by the fact that a mound is called smasãna. Since susãna seems to derive from svini , the users of susãna could be related to the users of sum, who are Kafirs. And the latter are known (Continued from p. 107) i.e., it is "dome-shaped". Thus stüpa here means "a mass with a dome-shaped top". In RV. VII .2. led Agni is described as sending up his smoke. It is common knowledge that when clouds of smoke rise up they form "a dome-shaped mass" {stüpa). This meaning of the word is supported by the TB 13.4.4 where the word stüpa is explained by Say ana as ^§T: (a heaped portion) i.e. a dome-shaped mass. The Vinayapitaka (4.35) in ïï oíhí^i has thüpa as a common noun meaning "a mass with a dome-shaped top" referring to a heap of food as alms collected in a monk's bowl while begging from house to house. This food, consisting of layers of different kinds of food, forms a heap. The rule laid down here prohibits the monk from turning the heap up and down i .e . mixing . Also compare Pali $yÍMcb&lt;¿ = heaped up, Assami "thup" = heap, Nepali "thupro" ( A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo- Aryan Languages , by R. L.

That their ancestors were pre- Rgvedic Aryans can be inferred from (a) linguistic, (b) ethnological, and (c) theological evidence. (a) Linguistic evidence : Kafir/Nuristani languages have preserved certain phonetic Indo- Aryan features which are not found in Indo-Iranian languages. Proto-Indo-European *vespi is preserved in the Nuristani group of languages. Thus we have siplk in Ashkun, waspik in Waigali and wuspi in Kati (ibid. p. 162). Also the Indo-European instř. pl. inflection is .The Rgveda has besides , the latter borrowed from west Iranian. The Nuristani languages which too are influenced by west Iranians, have trpj: only which (as |ff/^f|/fft) is found in Pali and Prakrit languages. Thus xrft: is a pre-Rgvedic inflection (ibid. p. 161). (b) Ethnological evidence: The Kafirs have preserved such personal names as Janaka and Devakï (PL, vol.2,p.l54) which are not found in the Rgveda. The phonetic pattern of these names is Sanskritic, and the roots are Proto-Indo-European. Janaka re-appears as a king of Videha (SB 11.3.1.2; 11.4.3.20; 11.6.2.1 etc., the JB 1.19.2, the BÄU3. 1.1; 4.1.1; 4.2.1 etc. and Kausïtakï Upanisad 4.1) and is called "Vaideha" (SB 14.6.10.1 and 14.6.11.6) which makes him a Dãsa (see fn.19). Moreover, in the Upanisads, Janaka is a champion of heretical traditions. It is now common knowledge that the Upanisads represent such a tradition ( ODBL , p.32 and VA/,p.l36). Devakï, in the Purãnas, is the mother of Krsna, who opposed Indra- worship. The Kafirs were thus rooted in a non-Rgvedic tradition which was also pre-Rgvedic and which also makes its presence felt in the Brãhmanas, the Upanisads, and the Purãnas. Another ethnographical detail might help us to establish the identity of the Kafirs. The Kafir "utah" (The Kafirs ofHindukush by George Robertson (1896), Rpt, New Delhi: Motilal Banarasidass, hereinafter: KHy pp. 83,415) reminds one of Vedic Hotr. He wears, on ceremonial occasions, "a thick stumpy turban" which has in front a fringe of cowrie shells strung together with red glass beads and is furnished with a tail (ibid, pp.416, 424). One is reminded of the Vrãtya turban (usnisa) which, according to Kãtyãyana Srautasütra (22.4.1 1) was obliquely wound round the head with a long tail (also see p. 1 10 of VAI for more information). This important equipment of a Vrãtya Grhapati is not mentioned in the Rgveda. The AV. (XV .2); SB (3.3.2.3); TB (16.6.13; 1.14) and Aitareya Brãhmana (6.1) mention it in connection with the Vrãty as, who were the Dãsas (see fn. 19). (o Theological evidence : The chief deity of the Kafir pantheon, is Imra i.e. Yamarãjã. The people who brought the Bactrian and Hissar III culture to N-E Iran and N-W India were the Dãsas and they worshipped Ausra-s, especially Yama and Varuna. This proves that the Yama- worshippers, the Kafirs, are the Dãsas ("The Harappan Priest-king's Robe and the Vedic Tãrpya Garment" etc. by A. Parpóla in South Asian Archaeology , 1983, p.393). Marginalised like Yama in the Rgveda is the goddess Dhisanã. The cultic forts with fire at the centre, characteristic of the Dãsa religion (as in Margiana and Bactria), are associated with the worship of the ancestors and goddess Dhisanã in the pagan religion of the Kafirs (Continued on the next page )</page><page sequence="20">110 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) vogue among the Rgvedic Ãryans as early as the time of the composition of the YV Samhitãs. and as in the case of caitya- worship, the Rgvedic Aryans borrowed both - the practice of erecting mounds and the word for it. The process underlying the word smasãna is similar to that underlying the word caitya (see fn. 29). Thus the borrowed word susãna could have been Sanskritised as smasãna on the basis of an existing Sanskrit word smasã. The foregoing discussion of caitya and smasãna provides further linguistic evidence in support of Parpola's thesis regarding the acculturation of the Rgvedic Aryans in India - first in the Punjab and then in the east. Turning to the Buddhist tradition, the earliest text to use the word thüpa for a mound is the MPS . It may seem surprising that the Buddhists, whose laity was mostly recruited from the members of the tribes among whom the Buddha lived as a religious teacher (MPS, intr., p. xviii), did not use the Dãsa word (susãnazzmound originally and then a cemetery as stated above). It is likely that in the Buddist tradition too the process noticed above in the replacement of smasãna by citi etc. was at work with the result that by the time of the Buddhist Pali texts , or even long befor susãna had lost its original connotation ( Continued from p. 109) to the present day. The name of this goddess is kept alive in the Kafir languages. This goddess is associated with the Dhisnya fire-places in the later Vedic works (/¿&gt;/&lt;lp.393). For "Dhisanä in the Rgveda " see various views quoted in the Vedic Index (Vol. I, p. 399). Out of these views Pischel's view appears close to the Kafir connotation of "a goddess", though he does not connect her with fire. Šarva, an Indo-Iranian god, who does not appear in the Rgveda , was worshipped in Nuristan till the end of the 19th cent. (KH, p. 567). Šarvadatta Gãrgya is the name of a teacher in the Varhsa Brãhmana ( Vedic Index , Vol. II , p .365) . One suspects that the people (pre-Rgvedic Indo-Iranians) who worshipped Šarva were responsible for his appearance in the Brãhmana literature several centuries later and had a hand in its composition. Morgenstierne (PL, Vol. 2, p. 154) mentions Kafir gods and goddesses. Thus the Kafirs worshipped Indra (Inthra in KH , pp. 381 , 388, etc. and Indra in the Rgveda) by invoking him with libations of wine and was considered to be playing "polo" when it thundered. Another male god of the Kafirs is Mahãndev (Purãnic Mahãdeva) . He does good and harm and is invoked in illness. He, as a war god, reminds one of the war cry of the Marathas " hara hara mahãdeva ". He is also called Kušala, a name which could be responsible for his later name "Šaňkara" = The Kafir godde- sses are: KushumãÍ (Shumãí in KH, p. 616); Kumrãí (Krumãí in ibid, p.616), a female spirit connected with rain and ripening of grapes and fruits, and Jestak, the protector of homes. The popular Kafir- worship thus represents a vertical section of their ethnic history in which the Indo-Iranian element follows the aboriginal but precedes the Rgvedic. The above considerations help us to identity the Kafirs with the Dãsas. This justifies our explanation regarding the word smasãna as a Sanskritisation of susãna (which originally meant a mound), a later reflex of the pre-Rgvedic "sunî" in the language of the Kafirs.</page><page sequence="21">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 111 "mound", and like smasãna come to mean "a cemetery". It is this latter meaning of susãna that is found in the Buddhist Pali texts (all the Pali Dictionaries give susãna= cemetery). Therefore the word susãna was not appropriate for a mound. Similarly, Pâli renderings of cit, citi , citya, cayana (used in the sense of a mound in the Rgvedic tradition) could have been unacceptable because the attitudes toward the mound of the Rgvedic people on the one hand, and of the Buddhists and the Prâcyas on the other, were different. To the Rgvedic Aryans it was unholy and hence a source of fear.31 To the Buddhists and the Prâcyas, on the other hand, it was sacred, rousing feelings of joy and calmness in the heart {MPS, pp. 93-95). The foregoing discussion should make clear why the Buddhists (or even the pre-Buddhists, the Prâcyas for that matter) used a new word thüpa , a common noun, meaning "a dome-shaped mass" (see fn. 25). The earliest of the Pali canonical texts, the MPS , tells us that after his cremation, the Buddha's bones and ashes were kept in the Council Hall by the Mallas, who were honoured with conducting his funeral. Later, when the cremated bones were demanded by others , they were divided into eight portions which were given to eight different tribes, which in their respective territories erected mounds over them. Two more mounds were erected - one on the ashes and the other on the vessel in which the Buddha's body was cremated. The word thüpa was first used of these ten mounds only. The MPS (p. 90) refers to the four places - the sites of the Buddha's birth at Lumbini, his enlightenment at Bodhagaya, his first sermon at Sarnath, and his entering nirvãna at the säla-grove in Kushinagar - which served the same function as the thüpa- s since they too evoked feelings of reverence, calmness and joy in the hearts of the worshippers. The MPS means to refer to these sites as cetiya- s as can be inferred from the word cetiya-cärika used 3i In the Brahmanical tradition such monuments were a source of dread and impurity. The detailed rules given in the SB (13. 8. Iff) for erecting a sepulchral mound make this clear. Thus it is to be away from the village in a secluded place (13.8.12). It is not to be made on a path or in an open space 913.8.1.10). It should be encircled by stones (13.8.2.2). The pegs are to be fixed on four sides of the mound (13.8.4.1), furrows are to be dug up and filled with water (13.8.4.2), a clod of earth is to be placed mid- way between the mound and the village 913.8.4.12). These measures were adopted so that the dead did not cross over to the region of the living. Bath is prescribed on the way home (13.8.4.5). While a smasãna was encircled with stones to separate the dead and the living, a Buddhist stüpa had a railing to designate sacred territory. The earlier texts like the YV Samhitãs and the ones like the Š rauta- and Grhya-sütras have similar rules.</page><page sequence="22">112 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) of the pilgrims who visited these sites as sacred places. Though the pre- Buddhist cetiya worship was not part of the Buddhist belief, the Buddha honoured this institution current among the tribes (MPS, pp. 3-4). As these cetiya- s were sacred to the pre-Buddhist tribes, so were the four above sites to the Buddhists, and hence the MPS might have used the word cetiya to refer to them. The distinction so far maintained between a thüpa (mound) and cetiya (four sacred sites) in the Buddhist traditon was gradually lost and the mounds came to be called cetiya- s. This was probably the result of the fact that mounds were built at the "sites" on the objects associated with the Buddha and hence these sites were sacred. In ER it is stated that as time passed, the Buddha's relics became increasingly difficult to obtain. Hence the objects that helped the people remember him were enshrined in the thüpa-s (Vol. 14, p. 93). Thus a mound was built at the "site" on the three stones used by him-one for sitting, another for washing, and still another for drying clothes. The Buddhacarita of Ašvaghosa (SBE, vol. 49, part 1 , p. 197) refers to this mound as Šilagarbha caitya and not as a stüpa. Being a sacred site like the four sites mentioned above, it too is a caitya. Two more mounds called citya- s enshrined pieces of the Buddha's nails and his hair (ibid. p. 166). This shows that the word cetiya become a substitute for thüpa. Thus Milindapañha (140-110 B.C.) uses the word cetiya even for the original ten thüpa-s (see SBE, Vols., 35 and 36). The practice of calling a thüpa a cetiya must have existed even before the time of Milihdapañha. That an earlier text, Mahasmghikavinaya (the original core dates to 3rd cent. B.C.), felt the need to explain the difference between a thüpa and a cetiya shows that both had the same exterior shape of a mound as mounds were erected on a number of objects associated with the Buddha. The text thus felt the need to correct the usage by stating: If the Buddha's relics are enshrined, the site it called stüpa-, if not, it is called caitya (ER, vol. 14, p.93). Like the thüpa-s and the sacred sites, even the places where a single gãthã from the treatise of the Law was preached were called cetiya- (the Mahãyãna text, Vajracchedikã, SBE, vol. 49, part 2, p. 124). This suggests the sanctity attached to everything associated with the Buddha. IV Before we proceed to discuss the Purãnic reference to caitya, it is necessary to remember that the cult of the caitya is ancient in India and goes</page><page sequence="23">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caity a 113 as far back as the Indus Valley times. There are a couple of references to it in the Vedic tradition too (TS and ÄsGSü). However, when we come to the Purãnic times we find an efflorescence of it. How do we interpret these facts? If one follows the traditional view of the succession of the Vedas, the Brãhmanas , the Upanisads , the Sütras , the Epics and the Purãnas , one concludes that caity a- worship disappeared in Vedic times, but resurfaced in Purãnic times as a popular cult. But when an ancient cult "disappears" for some time and "reappears" millennia later, it does not mean that it was dead. Rather, it means that it was not recorded in the intervening period in the Vedic traditon. But it can be demonstrated that the Purãnic tradition is not a late phenomenon as is generally supposed. The texts like SB (11.5.6.8 and 13.4.3.13), ÄsGSü ( 1 0 .7 and 4 .6 .6) , SäSSü (16.1) and Äpastamba Dharmasütra (chapter 3), for instance, refer to the Purãnas. If these reference are not "interpolations," obviously this would suggest that the Purãnas existed contemporaneously with these Vedic works, though the Purãnas as we have them now are a very late redaction. It is possible, then, that caity a- worship was current even in Vedic times. Though not recorded in the purely Brahmanical texts like the Brãhmanas and the Sütras (except in ÄsGSü , the occurrence in which is already explained), it finds mention in the Purãnas which originated in the Dãsa tradition.32 Though later appropriated by the Brãhmanas,33 they 32 R. Chaudhari gives the following information: The Sütas, Mägadhas and Cãranas, who belong to the east, compiled the Purãnas. This connects the Purãnic tradition with the Dãsas or the Vrãtyas. The bards played an important part in the religious life and belief of the Vrãty as as their priests. Their function was to sing the praises of imperial dynasties, especially that of Prthu, and thus act as the bardic repositories of the annals and chronicles of the royal dynasties. The bardic tales of the Purãnas have thus preserved a historical tradition. The bards also chronicled the histories of the Devas, Asuras, Rsis and other important persons. The Vrãty a hymn ( AV 15.6.4) tells when the Ekavrãtya moved, the Itihãsa and the Purãnas followed him. Unlike cetiya and susäna , the Pali word mãgadha (literally, one who belongs to Magadha) in the sense of a "bard" is retained in Sanskrit in the same form and sense (VAI, pp.38, 46, 85-86, 104 and 106). 33 F. E. Pargiter ( Ancient Indian Historical Tradition , Motilal Banarsidass , Delhi , Rpt. 1 997) states that the original Purãnas which had been compiled by the end of the 7th cent. B.C. were characterized by pañcalaksana- s (^9^ I ŠQ ïïô^çtutitI I ). The extant Purãnas, however, contain large quantities of other matter, especially, brahmanical doctrine and ritual, dharma of all kinds, the merit of the tîrthas, etc. He quotes a long list of such matter from the MP and PP and concludes that it represents later additions made by the Purãnic Brahmins. The additions reflect a combination of Brahmanical rituals and practices, and popular/Dãsa cults and beliefs, a result of the fusion of the two traditions - Brahmanical and Däsaic. The Brãhmana appropriation of the original Purãnas happened during or after the age of the Brãhamnas (which ended approximately around 600 B.C.) and the Upanisads (pp. 5 ,36,37, 62 ,326).</page><page sequence="24">1 14 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) reflect the popular composite culture of the time which arose due to the fusion of two traditions - the Vedic and the Dãsaic. The possibility of the existence of caifya-worship in the Vedic times is confirmed by another interesting fact recorded in the Vedic tradition, namely, the Bhüta-yajña, the various details of which lead one to conclude that it was an attept to vedicise a non-Vedic practice. The Bhüta-yajña referred to in the Grhyasütras (like PGSü, KhGSü, and Äpastamba-grhya-sütra ) and the Dharmasütras comes closer to the ca/iya- worship of the Däsas. Thus there is baliharana (offering carried to the deity is placed on the ground) but no homa, a criterion that determines whether a yajña is a Deva-yajña or Bhüta-yajña (compare Taittirla Äranyaka 2.10 - orfq I Also compare Haradatta on ÄsGSü 1.10.1-8 črcw ¿KHÌ ^ i H The Bhüta-yajña involves worship of the bhüta- s in things like water, the middlepost, the door of the house, the house itself and trees. The use of the word bhüta suggests that these beings are not on par with the devatã- s, a term applied to Vedic gods in this traditon. Thus while to a Dàsa a being in a tree is a devatã ( cetiya= rukkha- devatã), to the Rgvedic Ãryans it is a bhüta. That the " bhüta-s " were degraded Dãsa devatã- s becomes clear from the inclusion of rãksasas, nisãcaras and divãcaras in the list of such beings. Surprisingly, however, Rgvedic gods like Indra, Varuna and Višvedevas too are included in the same list. Against this background, let us discuss the references to tree- worship in the Purãnas . Here we have ( 1 ) the Vrksotsavavidhi, (2) the ritual of Vatapüjä. In both these places there is no mention of the word caitya. Further, there are references to (3) caitya with sanctity attached to it, and finally also to (4) caitya with an unholy connotation. The MP (59.1-20) and the Padma Purãna (5.24.192 to 211) mention Vrksotsava and the vidhi to.be followed. The trees to be worshipped in this festival seem to have had platforms around them (as in the case of the caitya-s). What is important is that the mode of worship described here is like the one followed in the case of the cetiya- s (see fn. 23), with the addition of one element, the homa. The earliest reference to tree worship (TS 3.4.8.4, quoted earlier) also mentions homa to the Gandharvas and the Apsarases (who, like the Yaksas, reside in trees) and so does the</page><page sequence="25">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caity a 115 AsGSü (1.10.1-8). The requirement of homa in all these texts is an attempt to vedicise an original Dãsa ritual which does not involve homa (compare the Indus seal with the picture of a kneeling priest offering a human head on the altar round a Pippala tree, see fn. 13). Invoking gods like Indra and the Lokapãlas too along with the trees in the Vrksotsava is also part of the vedicisation of a Dãsa ritual. The ritual of Vatapüjä (compare &lt;3T«i ijyifaí =l¿*nfafacb šRŤ II «ÌMciitìi čré II ^ II *T9ldl&lt;*iM&lt;;fèPFT II ïïïï: yiňiíí ^MÍdsIdlM^II 9o || ^'1^^ ^FF^TTcf: Alfafa MÍd^drl II W íf čfS*«t à ^T: M II ^IT ^ïft ^Rjcdl II FRÍ ^TTčí Fïïïï II , Nãrada Purãna 124.9-12 and qóSRSqí çfift HSWcíÍH I fa&lt;MÌ»-Ì)fadl ïïift II H II SR#: cbuó^^i || čr^IWFí ^fT ^PM: II Ç II I ïïrïT fêvTTÏÏ FHT fa*)4¿ldj HlfrÉ ïffaïït ^HiJlfccbHl^ldJI ¿ II , Agni Purãna 104.5-8) performed by suvãsini-s on the full-moon day of the month of Jyestha reminds one of the ca/fya-worship of the Däsas in that it consists of items like dancing and singing and hanging threads smeared with kuñkuma, etc. from the trees. There exists a similarity between caitya-yajña (in ÁšGSu) and the Vatapüjä today. In the former the offering is carried to the deity on a Palaša-leaf and in the latter it is made on a Vata-leaf. It is noteworthy that Sãvitri is described here as vatasthã, a goddess whose abode is the Vata tree. These facts indicate that the Vatapüjä originated among the Däsas . This is confirmed by the fact that a forest dedicated to Sãvitri (Sãvitravana) is located in the Uttarakuru, a Dãsa region.34 It is interesting that in Bengal, which became part of the Prãcya country very late, women observe a vow called Sãvitricaturdasi on the 14th of the dark half of Jyestha to secure blessed wifehood in the next life (HDS, vol. V, pt.I, p.93.). A clear reference to caitya as a sacred tree-shrine comes only in the following passages from the Purãnas: (l)^n^ ^ cm ciò řf II xo II finfei) ter ^er: îRfwr im II (BP 221), (2) umK'üpu- 34 Compare 3rTCf?&gt;Ptô?TI?T ü I I PlrMHd: *tl I MP 83.34.Tr.

This verse is part of the description of the decorations of Ayodhyã.35 Besides these references, we have some more passages where the word caitya is used.

The very fact that the caitya- s mentioned in these three passages are forbidden places suggests that they could have been associated with cremation.36 I may add here that the catuspatha mentioned at BP 221.40 (quoted above) could be holy because it was possibly associated with Rudra,37 though the catvara and catuspatha mentioned at VP 3.1 1.120 were unholy because of their association with the sepulchral mounds of the Dãsas. The mention of caitya- worship in the Purãnas, after its inclusion in the domestic rituals of the school of Ašvala, shows that this practice was deep- rooted in the region of the compilation of the Purãnas- the eastern Dãsa country to which Ašvala had migrated from Kosalà (see p. 98). One may note that holy trees like Vata, Pippala, Udumbara with platforms around them are a common sight all over the country. It is equally remarkable that stones smeared with vermilion symbolising devatã- s are placed at the base of the trunks of these trees. Parallel to the caitya- s, the abodes of the devatã- s of the Dãsas, there are devâyatana- s, the abodes of the Vedic gods. The first mention of a devãyatana comes in the Dharmasütras. Thè distinction between a caitya and ss It is surprising that in complete disregard of the context, V. R. Ramacandra Dikshitar (The Purãna Index, Vol.I, University of Madras, 1951) takes caitya here to refer to "a tree connected with a funerary mound". 36 Compare in this regard: 1) ibid. p.61 1 and 2) my comments on the quotation from ST on p. 99 of this paper. 37 ca gives the following information: According to SB (2.6.2.8.) cross-roads are the favourite haunt of Rudra. GGSü (2.4.2) advises the bridegroom, travelling with his bride, to address the cross-roads by saying, "may no waylayers meet us". In doing so he calls Rudra for help but at the same time asks him not to harm them (Vol. 4, p. 166).</page><page sequence="27">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caitya 117 a devãyatana was maintained till the time of the Purãnas (see above for the various meaning of caitya in the Purãnas). But in the post-Purãna period, the period of the epics and later classical Sanskrit literature, the word caitya is used as a synonym of devãyatana, in addition to its Dãsa sense of a tree- shrine. The process which led to the use of this word for the four sacred Buddhist sites and then the Buddhist relic mounds (särira-stüpa- s), as we have seen in Section III, could also have led to its use as a synonym of devãyatana in as much as the sentiments of sanctity and reverence are attached both to caitya and devãyatana. If the acceptance of the Dãsa belief in caitya indicates the fusion of the Dãsas and the Rgvedic Äryans, the use of caitya and devãyatana as synonyms, perhaps, suggests the complete amalgamation of the two peoples resulting in a new composite culture. The first occurrence of caitya as a synonym of devãyatana comes in the epics, though this is not its exclusive meaning there. As a case in point, one can consider the references to caitya in the Rãmãyana ,38 The following renderings of the word caitya by the various commentators of the Rãmãyana, perhaps indicate the meanings the word had possibly acquired by their time. Thus caitya means: (1) Smartavya or sthalavišesa, perhaps a sepulchral mound (stüpa) as a memorial (cp. ŠB 13.8.1.1 for a smasãna as a monument). Erecting stupa- s for tribal heroes was a Dãsa practice, later taken over in the Vedic tradition and still later by the Buddhists. The latter erected them for their religious teachers. As stated in Section III, the use of the word caitya for stüpa is a later development in the Buddhist tradition. (2) catuspatha , a meaning derived from the first meaning because stüpa- s were erected at cross-roads both in the Dãsa and Buddhist traditions. (3) Buddhãlaya (Bauddhãlaya?), a Buddhist monastery? (For this meaning, compare Visvaprabhãsã quoted by Mallinãtha and Vallabhadeva on the Pürvamegha, verse 23.) (4) caitya-vrksa or gandharvãdisthãna, a shrine of vrksa-devatã, as in the Dãsa belief. (5) grãma-devatã-sthãna or devatãdhisthita-vrksa , somewhat like point number '4' but the Dãsa devatã- s are replaced by the local ones. (6) devãyatana, (7) rathyãvrksa, derived from meaning number '4', caitya being generalized into any roadside tree with a platform as a resting place for passersby. 38 The following are the references to caitya in the Ramãyana : Ayodhyã 3.18, 6.1 1, 17.16, 50.8, 56.33, 71.42; Yuddha 127.2, 39.24; Sundara 12.14 and 18.</page><page sequence="28">118 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) (8) gãnapatyãyatanam. caitya is the name of a Marut of the first gana (cp.

This meaning is far from acceptable in view of the context ( Ayodhyã 6.11) which states that the dhvaja- s are erected and patãkã- s are tied on the caitya- s.

These exceptions are: (1) caitya-yüpa mentioned at Ayodhyã 50.8. These are the yüpa-s connected with the fire altar (see p. 98), indicating the profuse sacrificial activity in Kosala. (2) a caitya-prãsãda mentioned in Sundara, Sarga 43. It is as tall as a mountain and has pillars covered with gold. Later Yuddha 39.23 describes a similar tall " prãsãda " of Rãvana and the next v. 24 refers to it as caitya. (3) Nikumbhilã-caitya at Yuddha 84.13 and 85.29. This is a reference to the temple of Nikumbhilã. To conclude, though on the whole the use of the word caitya as a synonym of devãyatana is less frequent than its use as "a tree with a platform," the present stduy shows that it was used in the sense of devãyatana, begining with the epics. To sum up the findings of this paper : The discussion of the relation of the Pâli word cetiya and its Sanskrit equivalent caitya in the Vedic tradition ( AšGSú ) leads to the conclusion that both refer to an important element in the religion of the Dãsas, namely , the worship of dèvatã- s residing in trees. This concept is alien to the Rgvedic tradition in which the tree itself was worshipped as a devatã. The Dãsa type of tree-worship is first mentioned in the TS ofthe KYV (composed in the Punjab), though without mentioning the word caitya. Later it is mentioned in the ÄsGSü, where the word caitya is used. The progenitor of this school of the Sütras, Ašvala, as we have seen, was an easterner. The facts adduced so far support Parpóla 's thesis of the acculturation of the Rgvedic Aryans in India, first in the Punjab and then in the east. The acculturation process is also reflected, as we have seen,</page><page sequence="29">Shruti Pradhan : The Biography of Caity a 119 on the linguistic level. A further inquiry into the use of cetiya and caitya in the Buddhist and Vedic traditions respectively, reveals that both started using these words in the funerary context, the former still as a noun and the latter as an adjective. The Vedic word cai'tya, besides being used in the Dãsa sense of a tree-shrine, acquired a new connotation, "related to cit, citi or citya". The latter words originally used of the fire altar (this too, incidentally, was a Dãsa practice borrowed by the Rgvedic Aryans) gradually replaced the original word smasãna for a mound. This was the result of the Vedic tradition establishing a connection between the fire- altar and the mound. A discussion of the word smasãna not only reveals that the erection of mounds was a Dãsa practice, but also that, as in the case of the word caitya, the word for it, too, was borrowed by the Rgvedic Aryans. The enquiry into words like citi, etc, thus brings out the fact supporting Parpola's acculturation thesis. A discussion of the word cetiya in the Buddhist tradition reveals that there also a similar process could have been at work, leading to the replacement of the Dãsa word susãna by thüpa first, and later by cetiya. The Buddhists skipped the Pali equivalent of Vedic cit, citi, citya and cayana and instead chose another Indo-Aryan word stupa (Pâli thüpa) for their mounds. The basis for this could be that while the Buddhist attitude towards the mounds was like that of the Dãsas, one of reverence, that of the Vedicists was one of fear. This shows that inspite of the amalgamation of the Dãsas and the Rgvedic Aryans, the Dãsa tradition, in its pure form, was preserved by the masses (tribes), some of whom embraced Buddhism. The Dãsa tradition of ca/řya-worship forms an important element of the popular Hinduism of the Purãnas. This is as it should be since, as we have seen, the Purãnas were a product of the Dãsas and composed in the east, though they were later appropriated by the Brahmanical tradition and vedicised, as we have seen time and again. The foregoing discussion shows that, as the Dãsas and the Sauma Aryans spread across the country , they accepted the existing practices, modified their own, and evolved a new composite culture, the elements of which can be distinguished, but the combination of which is a unique achievement of all the people of India.</page><page sequence="30">120 Annals BORI, LXXXIII ( 2002 ) List of Abbreviations ÃpáSu Ãpastamba Šrautasutra ÄsGSü Ãsvalayana Grhyasütra ÃsáSíi Ãsvalãyana Šrautasutra BAU Brhadãranyaka Upanisad BdP Brahmãnda Purãna BDSü Baudhãyana Dharmasütra BhP Bhãgavata Purãna BP Brahma Purãna BPSü Baudhãyana Pitrmedhasütra BŠSú Baudhãyana Šrautasůtra GGSü Gobhila Grhyasütra HGSü Hiranyakeši Grhyasütra JB Jaiminíya Brãhmana KãS Kãthaka Saiiihitã KhGSü Khãdira Grhyasütra KKS Kapisthala Katha Saiiihitã KYV Krsna Yajurveda MGSü Mãnava Grhyasütra MP Matsya Purãna MS Maitrãyaníya Samhirã PGSü Pãrskara Grhyasütra PrãPra Prãyascitta Prakarana PS Paithinasï Samhitã PU Prašna Upanisad ŠáŠSú Šánkháyana Šrautasůtra ŠB Šatapatha Brãhmana ŠS Šaunaka Samhitã SŠSů Satyãsãdha Šrautasůtra ST Sattrimšanmata ŠYV-MS Šukla Yajurveda Mãdhyandina Sariihitã TB Tãndya Mahãbrãhmana TS Taittirîya Sariihitã VP Visnu Purãna</page></plain_text>
