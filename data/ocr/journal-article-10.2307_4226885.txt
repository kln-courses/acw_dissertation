<plain_text><page sequence="1">J JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXVIII No. 4 December 1994 Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics: Veblen, Cultural Relativism, and Blind Drift Ann Jennings and William Waller The purpose of this essay is to reinterpret and partially refor- mulate Veblenian descriptions of evolutionary economics and cul- tural change from today's vantage point. This essay is not primarily an exercise in exegesis or the history of economic thought. Though we see its line of argument as faithful to Veblen's basic vision, we have also taken liberties with his original views and sometimes differed with him. We will use some of Veblen's criticisms of evolutionary concepts as used in neoclassical economics to outline, in detail, how evolutionary metaphors can be applied in the context of cultural theory. In doing so, we will inter- pret Veblen's concept of culture as an unfolding hermeneutic process. We will also connect Veblen's conception of "blind drift" to his anthropological method and to his critique of the standards of social "progress" that inform neoclassical economic Teleology (the use of big-T will be explained in the course of the article). Finally, we will discuss how Veblen's own standard of social progress, the reduction of invidious social distinctions, might be advanced. The authors are Assistant Professor of Urban and Regional Studies and Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, and Professor of Economics at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, Geneva, New York. This essay is dedicated to the memory of our teacher, Louis J. Junker. It has benefitted from suggestions by Anne Mayhew and an anonymous referee. 997</page><page sequence="2">998 Ann Jennings and William Waller For those familiar with Veblen's work on social evolution and subsequent institutionalist interpretations, some omissions from the present account will be particularly striking. Both "idle curiosity" and "instinct" conceptions of human behavioral motiva- tions, which ground many of the best-known institutionalist read- ings of Veblen on cultural evolution [Dowd 1958; Ayres 1958; Watkins 1958], are absent.1 We believe these terms lack clarity, are misleading, and are unnecessary. As described below, cultural complexity and cultural ambiguity provide an adequate context within which the small-t teleology of individual intentionality, as well as habit and nongoal-directed behaviors, can generate the open-ended processes of cumulative causation that Veblen em- phasized. Moreover, the tendency to link Veblen's "instincts" to various versions of the Veblenian dichotomy in some institu- tionalist arguments [e.g., Ayres 1958; Bush 1987] has sometimes produced confusion on the role of outdated instinct theories in Veblen's work2 and on the relationship between the dichotomy and possible progress in the course of cultural evolution. While Veblen did offer provisional standards against which "progress" in social evolution might be measured, he was not optimistic that the course of cultural evolution would overcome inherent tendencies toward blind drift. Reinterpreting blind drift, in terms of the various sour- ces of regularity and uncertainty in human cultural affairs, can help to illuminate the implications cultural evolution has for social 'progress." Moreover, causal efficacy-whether particular actions achieve expected results-is partly a matter of cultural regularities that cannot be neatly mapped onto the dichotomy. Metaphors, Hermeneutics, and Cultural Variation Evolution is a metaphor, an extended analogy regarding change, used by many economists to describe real processes of so- cial change but derived from studies in biology and the natural sciences.3 The use of analogies and metaphors from the sciences within economics is now well-traveled terrain [Mirowski 1988, 1989; McCloskey 1986; O'Connor 1988; Menard 1988]. Metaphors help structure theorizing by exploring similarities and differences in real phenomena across disciplines. The use of metaphors in analyses of real processes cannot be abandoned as linguistic mean- ing is constructed by metaphorical linkages among symbols. We</page><page sequence="3">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 999 must move beyond this level of generality, however, to explore the use of evolutionary metaphors in economics. Evolution, as a metaphor, has been transformed into a theoretical formulation of mechanisms for change in physical, biological, and social systems. Current understandings of the word "evolutionary" are strongly identified with Darwinian biological theories of change, often to the point of reification. That is, "evolu- tion" is no longer perceived as a metaphor for explaining or describing change in biological and other systems, but instead its frozen meaning becomes identified with all such changes. Distinc- tions are no longer made between the metaphor and the existen- tial change. When this occurs, metaphors become blunt instruments, substitutes rather than guides for theorizing. Reification of biological usages of the term "evolutionary" is significant in evolutionary social accounts. Its meaning can be- come identified more or less exclusively with the selection of "traits." Moreover, a crude analogy between social units and biological species, presuming direct correspondences between so- cial and biological systems, is usually made, often based on very naive understandings of biological theory.4 While some insight can be gained from these exercises, literal translations are not theorizing; instead, they curb the impulse to theorize. They may yield preliminary exploratory steps in the direction of theorizing [e.g., Nelson and Winter 1982] but can also supplant indigenous descriptions of evolutionary processes. When employed uncritical- ly, reified borrowings chiefly legitimize existing, nonevolutionary theories by appropriating the scientific status of biological evolu- tion [e.g., Alchian 1955; Friedman 1953]. Metaphorical borrowing can also take another form, which we call "heuristic" borrowing. In this case, indigenous theorizing is not displaced. Instead, evolutionary arguments about biological systems provide a guide and a source of insight for theorizing and research. Exploring the "fit" of the metaphor with the borrowing discipline is an essential task. Such "fitting" can itself yield in- sights for subsequent theory; specific attention to terms and relationships that are at odds with direct translations of the metaphor will be generated. Provisional explanations for observed phenomena, a list of relationships that will need to be explicated, appropriate theoretical structures, linkages, and modes of argu- ment, and directions for further research will be suggested as</page><page sequence="4">1000 Ann Jennings and William Waller well. It is this heuristic borrowing that we believe Veblen con- templated in his use of Darwinian imagery. Veblen's understanding of culture provides the context within which biological metaphors of evolution are used here. His cultural treatment of human beings, as both products and producers of cul- ture, is already implicitly evolutionary, but we reinterpret Veblen with a particular twist. Since we view culture as an interpretive integration of material objects, behavior, and their meanings- hardly new to institutionalists-we find it useful to think of Veblen's conception of cultural evolution as an evolving her- meneutic system; this is somewhat less conventional. The modifier "evolving" is crucial. It avoids the determinism of static hermeneutic systems; implies open-endedness rather than closure; allows cultural flexibility and the potential for human intent, dis- cretion, and problem solving; and grounds possibilities for cultural reinterpretation linked to multiple vantage points within culture, cross-cultural communication, and the development of critical reasoning. Without evolutionary open-endedness, human thought and action would be denied both processual purpose and any con- text for demonstrability, while Veblen's [1898] vehement opposi- tion to "natural law," "economic taxonomy," and "animistic" habits of mind would be unexplained and unsustainable.6 Veblen on Evolution Veblen's views of both culture and evolution are most extensive- ly described in his famous essay "Why Is Economics Not an Evolu- tionary Science?" [1898]. Much of what he wrote there is so well known by institutionalists that few introductory remarks about it are needed, but some things bear repeating. In particular, Veblen was concerned with "a genetic account of unfolding sequence" in contrast with the Historical School's "narrative survey" [1898, 72].7 Veblen's contrast of evolutionary approaches with historical narrative is crucial to understanding the cultural character of his approach. Narrative accounts of historical developments often fol- low a cause-effect sequence that appears similar to Veblen's view of cumulative causation, but narratives are necessarily constructed ex post. They can tell us where we are and the steps taken along the way, but they also structure our thinking about cultural cause and effect in unilinear ways. When we then contemplate our fu- ture, or address social policy, we tend to construct similar linear,</page><page sequence="5">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1001 unicausal sequences, thereby underestimating cultural com- plexity, the significance of human action, and the multiplicity of social consequences, but also overdetermining our story. History then appears as a meliorative trend (Big-T Teleology) leading up to all of the desirable circumstances of the present (and our cul- tural commitments will, indeed, often make the present seem desirable; see Veblen 1901, on Schmoller). Veblen expanded on his notion of the character of an evolution- ary science in a passage of "The Preconceptions of Economic Science III" [1900]. There he noted that "economists of the present day are commonly evolutionists, in a general way" but only to a "very uncertain degree." Taking Marshall's theories as his ex- ample, he states that the formulations are not arrived at by way of an inquiry into the developmental variations of economic institu- tions.... They say little, if anything, as to the order of suc- cession, as to the derivation and the outcome of any given phase, or as to the causal relation of one phase of any given economic convention or scheme of relations to others. In great part they formulate the normal inhibitory effect of economic exigencies rather than the cumulative modifica- tion and diversification of human activities through the eco- nomic interest, by initiating and guiding habits of life and thought.... it remains true that the laws which make up the framework of economic doctrine are, when construed as generalizations of causal relation, laws of conservation and selection, not of genesis and proliferation [1900, 176-77]. That is, Marshall neglects cumulative causation, the role of cul- tural habituation in behavior, and any discussion of variation and diversification. The last omission, of the sources of variation, is surely the most serious; it obscures the motive force for change, which Veblen identified in human intentionality (see endnote 7), and permits anachronistic beliefs in "a passive and substantially inert and immutably given human nature" [1898, 73]. Marshall's narrow focus on selection promotes Spencerian [1900, 167n] views of evolution as optimal accommodation to a given natural environ- ment (the status quo). As with the Historical School, a Big-T Teleological vision of change results.</page><page sequence="6">1002 Ann Jennings and William Waller Culture and Evolution The emphasis on selection mechanisms in many evolutionary accounts was clearly unacceptable for Veblen's vision of evolution- ary economics for fairly simple reasons. Such mechanisms are described in naturalistic terms that make them either constant or exogenous to the process of cultural evolution, whereas Veblen was interested in a theory of endogenous cumulative causation. All terms in the process are to be explained by, take their meaning from, and be "stated in terms of the process itself' [1898, 77]. Veblen's view of culture can be described as hermeneutic insofar as all meaning is self-reflexive and stems from the complex interre- latedness of the system itself.8 In hermeneutic systems, there are no disconnected terms, no exogenous constants, no supersystemic "selection mechanisms." This does not suggest that there are no "external terms" at all, or that novelty cannot enter hermeneutic systems "from outside." Rather, "external" influences must enter the system to matter and will have their "character" developed through the relationships of the hermeneutic system. It also does not suggest that hermeneutic relationships will seem similar from all locations within the system. Diverse experiences, vantage points, and visions can and do exist. Veblen's concern with variation over selection is an interest in processes of cumulative causation and endogenous motive forces, or initiation points, for action and change; external motive forces ("shocks") are momentary and trivial. For example, exogenous mo- tive forces might include environmental shifts. In Veblen's scheme, we must consider the consequences of such shifts: Do "adaptations" simply spring forth to recreate "equilibrium" in the "organism-en- vironment" relationship, or do such changes initiate new or broader, more complex processes of cumulative change? The former case does not initiate cumulative evolution and implies both exogenous selection and fortuitous variations. The latter yields a progression that rapidly outruns its initial cause, is governed by endogenous interrelationships, and becomes the mat- ter of interest to Veblen. Endogenous shifts in organism-environ- ment relationships, meanwhile, require an explanation for how they arise, unless they are merely serendipitous, and how they un- fold. Again, Veblen's interest is in ongoing, cumulative change, not serendipity. The individual intentional acts that produce en- dogenous shifts must also be located within larger sequences of systemic change.</page><page sequence="7">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1003 Evolutionary accounts focusing on selection mechanisms and fixed constraints typically presume that selection constitutes "im- provement." Veblen's personal ambivalence on the question of so- cial improvement is widely known. While he based his hopes for such improvement on idle curiosity as the foundation for human knowledge [1918, chap. 1], he believed as well that cultures often failed to replace obsolete understandings with newer, more ser- viceable ones. Indeed, "imbecile institutions" [1914] might them- selves be viewed as endogenous "fixed constraints" that inhibit improvement or reduce cultural viability; he also believed that en- dogenous changes could cause difficulties that might be unsuc- cessfully negotiated due to imbecile institutions. Such constraints as exist are largely cultural, and "selection" for improvement, if it can be called that, might fail. Veblen's hermeneutic view of cultural change does not allow separation (beyond the admission of presystemic "raw materials") of environment and human life. The meaningful articulation of "the environment" with human life is encompassed by the her- meneutic system. Veblen [1898, 74-5] describes "a cumulative process of adaptation of [cultural] means to [cultural] ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process."9 Veblen's principle of culture does not accommodate the mind- matter, culture-nature, organism-environment dualisms that adaptive selection implies. In this, he is consistent with some perspectives in more recent anthropology. Marshall Sahlins [1976a] has been very explicit on his views of the question: The anthropological concept of culture . . . leaves behind ... such antique dualisms as mind and matter, idealism and materialism. [It replaces them with] a tertium quid, [culture,] not merely mediating the human relationship to the world by a social logic of significance, but constituting by that scheme the relevant subjective and objective terms of the relationship. Cultures are meaningful orders of persons and things. Since these orders are systematic, they cannot be free inventions of the mind [p. ix-x]. Sahlins's account is highly evocative of Veblen. Cultural be- haviors are both deeply habituated and systematically complex.</page><page sequence="8">1004 Ann Jennings and William Waller Veblen clearly stated his belief in systematic complexity in that "there is . . . no neatly isolable range of cultural phenomena that can be rigorously set apart . . . [as] economic." Further, "the economic interest does not act in isolation, for it is but one of several vaguely isolable interests on which the complex of teleological activity carried out by the individual proceeds." And, "the base of [teleological] action . . . at any step in the process is the entire organic complex of habits that have been shaped by past process" [1898, 77].10 Evolutionary and cultural processes cannot be partitioned within Veblen's cultural view of evolutionary economics. This makes Veblen a very unusual economist: No prior, legitimately narrowed focus on what we, at best conventionally but more probably erroneously, label "economic institutions" is tenable. Markets, and outcomes "in them," are not the only or perhaps even the major "set" of phenomena that must be addressed."1 Even if we focus on a "subset" of social processes, we must recognize that market activity is predicated on the entire "complex of teleological activity" and not merely "vaguely isolable" economic interests. Veblen's perspective is uniquely complex and noncompartmental- istic, rooted as it is in cultural continuity. The principle of cultural continuity operates both as dynamic continuity over time (evolutionary cumulative causation) and as flexible continuity across the full array of human cultural and teleological behaviors (hermeneutics). We must be cautious in using expressions like "sets of working rules" or "cultural traits" to capture the meaning of culture in Veblenian institutionalism. Cul- ture is not a "set," but a complex of rules, an organized and or- ganizational hermeneutic network in which no "trait" or "rule" stands alone or derives any cultural force apart from its complex processual context. "Traits" or "rules" cannot evolve selectively in isolation from one another (see endnote 4). Nor, given the flexibility that we will describe below, does any trait or rule con- front different elements or agents in the system in necessarily uniform ways. So, what drives cultural evolution, as Veblen conceived it? The answer, simply stated, is individual teleological action guided by the cultural hermeneutic. Veblen rejected Big-T Teleological dimensions in culture as a whole and criticized neoclassical equi- librium propositions on precisely this point. Veblen's teleology is solely small-t teleology, the purposeful acts of cultural individuals.</page><page sequence="9">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1005 Clearly, cultural matrices must be flexible for Veblen's vision of cultural evolution to occur. The problems confronting individuals and most of the tools for their solution are posed by current cul- tural relationships, but some scope for novel individual responses to them must exist. Veblen originally framed the individual intentionality (human cultural behavior) on which his cultural evolution relies in terms of his theories of instincts and idle curiosity (see endnotes 1 and 2). We will express individual intentionality, below, in terms of human problem solving and the ambiguous flexibility of complex cultural matrices. Cultural matrices must accommodate novelty and, indeed, will generate it from human action even when change is not sought. A Sketch of Hermeneutical Cultural Evolution The sketch of cultural evolution that follows is a reformulation of Veblenian arguments and is not intended to settle historical questions of what Veblen originally thought. Veblen's own ac- counts of cultural evolution are relatively meager, were con- centrated in his early essays (collected in The Place of Science in Modern Civilization [1919]), and seem to have been methodologi- cal preparations for his later studies. Our main intent is also methodological; we offer a summary of the general arguments and parameters of cultural evolution that have been important in our applications of Veblenian insights to historical processes of in- vidious distinctions under pecuniary culture. Our further objective is to reconsider the prospects for evolutionary 'improvement" in light of recent (especially feminist) scholarship.12 To formulate a theory of endogenous, hermeneutic cultural change, we suggest that only a few basic propositions are needed. First is the multi- dimensionality of human behavior, which expresses Veblen's belief that all teleological acts are motivated by and have conse- quences for the entire complex of cultural processes as they exist at a point in time. Second is the principle of ubiquitous social con- flict. This is less dramatic than it sounds; it refers to the existence of ongoing and continually reemergent problems, of gaps between what is the case and what needs to be the case, resulting in ongo- ing flows of teleological behaviors by individuals.13 Third is the principle of cultural flexibility which, when combined with human action and ingenuity, creates the possibility of individual and cul-</page><page sequence="10">1006 Ann Jennings and William Waller tural novelty. It is also fundamental to the fact that individuals with different locations within the matrix can experience and in- terpret even identical processes in different ways without thereby rupturing the cultural web. A multidimensional understanding of human cultural behavior implies that evolutionary "selection" is part of, rather than sub- sequent to, novel variation. Teleological acts are rooted in the com- plex meanings of the cultural matrix in which actions occur. Hermeneutic complexity sets limits on the ranges of both the meanings of various acts and the actions that individuals are like- ly to consider as they pursue their objectives. The social logic precludes some possibilities while "selecting" others.14 The ubi- quity of social conflict requires a lengthier explanation. It is the basic "stuff' of cumulative variation and selection. Conflict sug- gests that cultures are continually in flux; no "equilibrium state" ever arises. Some conflicts that individuals encounter in their daily lives are routine and mundane; others are more novel and disturb- ing, though routine and disturbing properties are not fully separable. Routine conflicts have "tried and true," habituated solu- tions; disturbing conflicts require individuals to exercise ingenuity. Routine conflicts arise from the fact that human needs, as defined by the culture, are never met once and for all but recur. For example, upon arising in the morning, each of us confronts a gap between what is the case (an empty stomach) and what needs to be the case. Needs met yesterday must be met again today. Every culture has a habituated means of meeting recurrent basic needs [Waller 1988]. Routinized solutions remain complex, and food production, distribution, and preparation still have complex cultural consequences, but most are anticipated. The consequences of routinized problem-solving may not always be fully anticipated. Everyday behaviors sometimes produce dis- locations in the linkages of accepted practice (habit), either due to random shifts in routine or from simple "quantitative" repetition. Human beings are not automatons or machines; they are complex, creative, sometimes playful, frequently uncertain, and socially responsive. Minor variations in individual activity can yield tiny "pinpricks" of dislocation in the cultural matrix that, when summed across all individuals in society, sometimes cause larger, noticeable dislocations. Fluctuations or shifts in consumer pur- chases, or increases in birthrates nine months after major bliz- zards, are examples of this. Recent nationwide garbage problems</page><page sequence="11">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1007 are a stellar example of how quantitative repetition can also cause dislocations of routine. These dislocations may be in the patterns of habit and routine themselves or in the routine problems to which habits are linked. Given complexity, as well as the simultaneity of multiple in- dividual actions, such dislocations reverberate throughout the so- cial matrix, even if the ripples are modest. They give rise to minor shifts in the cultural medium, minutely alter the trajectory of in- dividual actions, and yield open-ended uncertainty. New problems emerge in new forms, requiring novelty and ingenuity in problem- solving behavior; these will have further complex consequences for relatively routinized cultural activities. Novelty requires adjust- ments to the cultural hermeneutic as "new terms" enter the social logic. Normally, cultural flexibility accommodates these disloca- tions fairly easily. Occasionally they compound, giving rise to larger social conflicts; habits that are out of sync with problems ("imbecile institutions") can amplify problems and dislocations, re- quiring more concerted and coordinated efforts than single in- dividuals can muster to induce novelty within the system. Legislative and judicial action by governments sometimes serve this end. Social movements can as well. Daniel Rodger's [1987] description of the transformation of social meanings of "the state" in relationship to "democracy" and "the people" during the Jack- sonian era is a good example. American cultural beliefs were al- tered by concerted attempts to exploit cultural flexibility and the necessary ambiguity of cultural meanings, to be explained shortly. The recent rise of "rights discourse," as in Martin Luther King's proclamation of the "right to protest for rights," is another excel- lent case. It also illustrates the close relationship between cultural flexibility and differences of experience and understanding due to social location. New knowledge also figures in both resolving and creating new cultural problems; it both stabilizes and destabilizes. The ap- pearance of new problems requires individuals or groups to create new, different, or more linkages in the system of recognized cause and effect relationships that form the cultural matrix. Even the creation of simply more linkages partially reintegrates systems of self-referential meaning, yielding cumulative changes in the cul- tural hermeneutic. Moreover, new knowledge, and all cultural in- novation (or diffusion), will yield some unanticipated conse- quences when used. The facts of the nuclear age are a spectacular</page><page sequence="12">1008 Ann Jennings and William Waller example.15 Cultural rearrangements needed to incorporate newly recognized cause and effect relationships frequently compel the search for further knowledge, explaining why "nontraditional" societies often establish social institutions expressly intended to seek new knowledge. The need to act to solve problems results, at least occasionally and in some societies frequently, in the need to act in new ways to rearrange or expand the cultural logic. Cultures that lack flexibility-that is, are too specific in their expression of the inter- relationships within the cultural system-will have difficulty sur- viving the social effects of novel problems and conflicts. Such inflexibility is mostly cultural. "Material conditions" impose only loose limits on how human needs can be met [Sahlins 1976a]; otherwise a cultural hermeneutic could not encompass "the en- vironment" at all (although relatively inflexible cultural systems may experience such limits as relatively absolute). The looseness of "material" limits on culture is shown by the degree of cultural variation actually observed around the world, while historical variation also supports a modest view of geographical inflexibility. Two main factors contribute to cultural flexibility: ambiguity and redundancy. Ambiguity is always present in systems of cul- tural meaning because all human understandings and knowledge are metaphorical in nature. Ambiguity permits systems of cultural meaning to be modified, through shifts in weightings of multiple cultural linkages, as novelty arises. It also allows many such shifts to pass unnoticed, since possible meanings are modestly rear- ranged rather than discontinuously created. As systems of ac- cepted practice (habit) and prescription, cultures experience some degree of trauma when discontinuous meanings are introduced, and their ability to function as legitimating systems can be threatened. This helps explain how nineteenth century middle- class women could expand assigned homemaking roles into reputable (though underpaid) "social homemaking" professions, but working-class women had much greater difficulty obtaining respect and rights in their less "feminine" occupations [Matthaei 1982; Yanagisako 1979]. It also illuminates the intense social divisiveness of race in American history: Both the historical ex- clusion of blacks from white social norms and access by blacks to an alternative African cultural heritage [Jennings and Champlin 1993] have seriously stressed the flexibility and integrative poten- tial of our cultural ambiguities.</page><page sequence="13">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1009 Cultures that recognize fewer hermeneutic linkages and mean- ings among cultural terms or have fewer terms will, in general, be less flexible than those with more, as will systems with extreme specialization of social tasks. Overspecialization may also cause insufficient cultural redundancy. Redundancy is the corollary of ambiguity: terms can "stand in" for one another, permitting one to take over the "role" of another as shifts permitted by ambiguity occur. In terms of social activity, ambiguity allows agents to shift to "new tasks" without threaten- ing the canons of social legitimacy, while redundancy ensures the continuing performance of the activities from which some in- dividuals are removed. Where such redundancy does not exist, as today in the gender specialization of domestic labor, serious social stresses can result when shifts in the tasks of individuals or groups occur. "Overflexibility" can also be a serious problem. It implies the disintegration of cultural habit and linkages among meanings and processes. Ambiguity widens, potentially into dissonance, conflict, and unpredictability, that undermine the foundations for in- dividual purposefulness and problem-solving. The efficacy of ac- tion becomes less certain as the complex of cultural standards becomes less orderly. Recent events in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union illustrate the violence, reaction, and paralysis that can ensue (see endnote 24). Rupture and in- coherence, rather than a "smooth transition," should have been predictable risks in such attempts to rapidly reorient cultural "habits." How much ambiguity, specialization, flexibility, etc., cultures must have or can accommodate is a historical question. Our cur- rent knowledge of cultural processes is a product of what we have observed within cultures we can visit or have some record of, com- bined with the limits placed on our understanding by our own cul- turally recognized relations of cause and effect. The latter are flexible, or we could not contemplate the logic of other cultural systems at all, but there are no universal laws of cultural her- meneutics except those we imagine or reify from our own cultural understandings. The generalizations we make here are abstrac- tions from what seems common across some cases; they are provisional understandings constrained by the reinterpretive potential within culture. Reinterpretation is an acquired skill, however. Without this scope for reinterpretation, transactions or</page><page sequence="14">1010 Ann Jennings and William Waller discourse across cultures, among locations within a culture, and even the reinterpretation of cultural ambiguities in normal cul- tural flows, would be unimaginable. Evolutionary Metaphors Revisited: Adaptation and Speciation Evolutionary theories usually focus on both mechanisms of change and on selection and transmission of some changes while others disappear. The source of change in a cultural context is variation in cultural behavior. It matters little whether the actions are intentional or accidental; variations will occur, though we can meaningfully discuss different categories of variation in problem- solving behavior: individual "pinpricks," centralized government action, social movements, and the pursuit of new knowledge. Ex- planations of when, how, and why some variations result in lasting change and some disappear within the general flux of culture are a more difficult problem. The conventional biological approach focuses on two types of change: adaptation and speciation. It might be suggested that these correspond to Veblen's terms "selection" and "variation," but this attempt at direct translation of biological metaphors into cul- tural evolution fails. First, for "selection mechanisms" to be legitimate terms within a Veblenian vision of cultural evolution, they must, like all other aspects of the cultural hermeneutic, be ex- plained in terms of the process itself. The basis of teleological acts in cultural complexity means that even novel acts are guided by a complex cultural logic. "Selection" refers, then, to the sorts of variations a culture is likely to engender and can be used inter- changeably with variation if its "Veblenian" meaning is clearly un- derstood. We will, therefore, translate the biological label "adaptation" into cultural terms as "selection/variation" (one term) and call it "cultural adaptation." Cultural adaptations are presorted (filtered) but not predetermined. It is also worth repeat- ing that cultural adaption does not refer to changes in singular be- haviors or habits, but to the complex of patterned habits and activities that constitute individual lives in a cultural setting. 16 Another related objection to direct translation from biological adaptation to (non-Veblenian) cultural selection concerns the Big-T Teleological and dualistic nature of the way that adaptation metaphors are sometimes used. Adaptation, even within biology</page><page sequence="15">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1011 but a fortiori within social theory, is commonly applied ex post to changes that have already appeared; most changes are then taken to have been "selected" as beneficial "adaptations." Moreover, without a concept of culture that encompasses the "environment," the context within which change occurs is also viewed, ex post, as static, natural and given. Veblen specifically opposed evolution- ary discussions adopting "given conditions that are presumed to be normal and invariable" [1909, 240]. Non-Veblenian views of "selection" as "progress" rest on dualistic constructions, such as dynamic-static and culture-nature, and are linked to maintaining existing master-servant relationships [see Jennings 1992, 1993]. Conventional notions of beneficial evolutionary "selection" ex- press both our dominant cultural habits of thought and our self- congratulatory cultural impulses. Interestingly, Sahlins [1976b] bases a further argument against reified borrowings of biological metaphors by social scientists on this: "Natural selection" metaphors in biology are themselves borrowed from modern Western cultural interpretations describing nonhuman nature in the competitive but progressive self-imagery of bourgeois society. Hofstadter, in his classic Social Darwinism in American Thought [1948], makes this argument as well.17 Hofstadter also links im- agery of social competition, originating in Malthus, borrowed by Darwin, and reinterpreted by Spencer, to complacent Big-T Teleological justifications for social hierarchy as the consumma- tion of social evolution-echoing portions of Veblen's [1901a] as- sessment of Schmoller. These critiques of facile translations from biological to social metaphors are consistent with Veblenian her- meneutics, accepting only small-t teleology, and with Veblenian critiques of invidious distinction. "Speciation" is less commonly discussed in either biology or so- cial theory in part because it tends to be seen tautologically as a "default category," containing those cases that do not seem to fit "adaptation." Because what is observed is so commonly seen as adaptive by virtue of its existence, no real consensus exists on the content of the category "speciation," except that it is "not adapta- tion." "Macroevolutionary" biological theories, used by some anthropologists, have discussed speciation as an event involving "regulatory" rather than "structural" genes; speciation then occurs by reintegrating the existing structural elements of an organism and recreating organism-environment relationships [Diener 1980]. Though suggestive, these accounts still fail. Both cultural</page><page sequence="16">1012 Ann Jennings and William Waller "reregulation" and the "environment" are already present in her- meneutic cultural adaptation. As joint variation/selection, cultural adaptation involves reinterpreting hermeneutic linkages to accom- modate the novelties arising from individual, and sometimes group, teleological behavior. We need not discard the concept of speciation in cultural analysis, however. In biology, speciation is often viewed as "discon- tinuous" change, in contrast to the "continuous" changes of adapta- tion. The notion of discontinuous cultural change is intriguing in part because it offers an explanation for why cultural speciation is difficult to contemplate as more than a default category. Discon- tinuous cultural change might involve more dramatic reintegra- tions of the cultural hermeneutic than those normally permitted by ambiguous flexibility. That is, it implies a cultural leap to inter- pretations that are highly counterintuitive from the standpoint of other or earlier understandings. The native culture of persons seeking to understand speciation will make explanations or predic- tions of the dimensions of another species of culture difficult. The concept of cultural speciation should also be retained be- cause discontinuous cultural change is a historical fact. The gap between medieval Western interpretations of human social relationships and modern Western interpretations is large enough to constitute discontinuity and speciation. Such discontinuities also exist cross-culturally and, through anthropology, probably in- formed Veblen's critiques of American society. Discontinuity across cultural species yields relativism in human knowledge. Human knowledge is the explicit meaning and understanding of the world as it is constructed through social prac- tice and language within the context of a cultural matrix. Neces- sarily such meaning is partial and contextual; thus communication across or between persons whose understanding (knowledge) comes from different cultural matrices is also necessarily partial. Neither relativism in human knowledge nor cultural discontinuity is absolute; ambiguous cultural flexibility accommodates the reinterpretive potential needed for cross-cultural communication and for evolutionary potential, though in variable amounts. Slightly altering this conception of cultural relativism, described above as an aspect of cultural discontinuity and specia- tion, may also shed some further light on relativism in processes of cultural adaptation. Cultural relativism of the species variety is not the sole, and probably not the most damaging, variety of</page><page sequence="17">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1013 relativism. Different groups within a cultural matrix may inter- pret meaning and understanding (knowledge) differently, depend- ing on their location within the social structure; ambiguity and partiality could lead to different systems of conflicting meaning within a single cultural matrix; hence knowledge is also relative to a person's or group's location within the cultural matrix. This is far more problematic than the basic (relativist) fact that all human knowledge is generated within cultural settings. As recent feminist scholars have argued [Harding 1986], and as Veblen im- plied in condemning the "captains of erudition" [1918], dominant cultural beliefs are themselves very partial accounts of available understandings within any cultural formation. The hegemony of elite interpretations yields a far narrower, more invidious and ex- clusionary mode of relativism than what might be constituted with the full participation of all viewpoints present within a cul- ture.18 Cultural relativism, per se, is thus not the most pressing problem that partial knowledge presents. Instead, that which pur- ports to be most universal-the narrow form of relativism from which it derives its bad name-rests in fact on a flagrant parochialism of power and privilege. Elitist relativism can reduce cultural flexibility by requiring cultural adaptations to comport with many fewer cause and effect relationships than those for which reasonable cultural warrants actually exist. 19 The most important implication of these discussions of cultural adaptation and speciation concerns their links to cultural relativism. Relativism, particularly in its narrower, elitist form that represents privilege as universal insight, limits evolutionary potential by restricting cultural vision and, thus devaluing and underutilizing non-elite understanding, disables cross-cultural communication and protects the cultural myths that sustain social hierarchy. Intra- and intercultural relativism are not fully separable, however. Three examples of the interconnections suf- fice. First, many of our most egregious impositions on other cul- tures involve drains of foreign resources to fuel waste and invidious distinctions at home. Second, the study of race and sub- cultures, particularly by black feminist scholars, has powerfully connected these relativisms as well [Hill Collins 1990; Malson et al. 1988]. Third, multicultural studies informed Veblen's im- plicit concern oni elitist relativism in American cultural beliefs. Greater inter- and intracultural communication can aid the reduc- tion of invidious distinctions that centered Veblen's view of social</page><page sequence="18">1014 Ann Jennings and William Waller progress. It might also diminish those aspects of Veblenian blind drift that are most ominous but possibly most amenable to human intervention. Culture and Blind Drift: Four Sources The study of cultural discontinuity, in the cross-cultural sense, is part of the subject matter of anthropology. Anthropological un- derstandings require cultural reorientations to translate alterna- tive systems of meaning as faithfully as possible and are useful in learning to reinterpret meanings in our own society. They have al- ways been important in institutional economics and probably in- spired Veblen's reconceptualizations of American social and economic relationships. The concept of "myth" that Veblen used is based on identifying misrepresentations of social cause and effect in the beliefs that social individuals hold. It is easier to identify myths in other societies than in our own because of unconscious cultural commitments that are normal parts of belonging to a culture. Veblen's studies of other cultural formations contributed to his theories on American society. By per- mitting him to see into species of culture and to view cultures as mutable and reinterpretable, they also abetted his evolutionary perspective. Reinterpretations undermine the static myths that sustain elitist relativism within a culture. Veblen's concern with myths is implicit in his critique of Marshall's quasi-evolutionary economics. In the latter, the absence of cultural understandings obscured real cause and effect. Cumula- tive causation occurs by virtue of cultural processes; without cul- tural awareness, including awareness of distinct cultural species, human beings appear to be "much the same at all times and places."20 Thus, Marshall was only the latest (Spencerian; see Veblen 1900, 167n) vintage of natural law philosophy, dressed up as "natural selection." For Veblen [1919; 1901b], "blindness" meant that myths, the artifacts of cultural lag and habits of thought more suited to past relationships and practices than present exigencies, will not be identified. Cherished cultural certainties and social hierarchy will not be questioned. Thus, cultural relativism-or rather, the lack of awareness of cultural species-supports the status quo and narrower, elitist forms of relativistic belief. Failure to explore the dimensions and channels of cultural evolution has negative implications for the course of cultural</page><page sequence="19">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1015 evolution. Veblenian conceptions of blind drift, and much of the unease they convey, are closely related to this proposition. At least four distinct meanings and causes of Veblenian blind drift can be identified.21 Two are benign, but two are not. The most conventional interpretation of blind drift among cur- rent institutionalists rests on the complexity of cumulative causa- tion. Given complexity, ongoing change generates novelty and results in imperfect foresight. A second interpretation is almost as straightforward. Veblen's evolution operates on the small-t teleol- ogy of individual intentionality guided (filtered), but not deter- mined, by the cultural matrix of the individual. Human beings are not passive homogeneous globules of desire, but active agents who manipulate and stretch the ambiguity of inherited cultural relationships to achieve various objectives. Novel acts, with uncer- tain consequences, will normally arise with little ado. Summed across all individuals, larger and sometimes troublesome shifts emerge. The first two meanings of blind drift imply ontological un- certainty in human cultural affairs, but they are also vital to human problem-solving processes. Veblen's concern with cultural myth yields two other sources of blind drift. The third meaning is misdirected intentionality stem- ming from restrictions placed on human foresight by the privileg- ing and maintenance of elite vantage points in cultural knowledge. Misdirected intentionality results when fictions that could be challenged with culturally available knowledge are nevertheless sustained by universalistic claims. Cultural adapta- tions always involve presorting human options to reduce uncer- tainty in social activities and to sustain order. To sustain hierarchical order, however, myths misrepresent cause and effect and sabotage reassessments of real possibilities. This is the cul- tural "choice" to run deliberately in blinders,22 excluding ex- periences from other cultural locations that conflict with dominant beliefs and ignoring correctives to partial knowledge when privilege is threatened. Misdirected effort and misjudged consequences are direct costs of maintaining social hierarchy. A fourth interpretation of blind drift is implied by complacent and elitist standards of progress. Human intentions are normally directed toward improvement, but improvement is also culturally defined. Dominant social theories resting on constancy in human nature and natural restorations of favorable equilibria legitimate the status quo through universal claims; they deny the prospect of</page><page sequence="20">1016 Ann Jennings and William Waller substantive evolutionary change. Improvement then becomes only a matter of more: more resources, more goods, more efficiency, as in conventional economics. "Different" violates the (sole) Paretian criterion and cannot be seriously discussed. That no real standard of human progress follows is seen in Marshall's focus on long run equilibrium. Veblen's critiques of Clark [1908] and Schmoller [1901a] also explicitly targeted the absence of any significant vision of progress for the future. In such cultural self-congratula- tion, ongoing change is misconceived as Teleology at the expense of foresight or vision. The blind lead the blind, complacently ignorant of real social inequities and wasted human potential. We have now suggested four causes of blind drift in Veblen's evolutionary accounts: (1) cultural complexity and cumulative causation always yield some cultural novelty; (2) individual acts exploit cultural ambiguity in a guided but nondeterministic fashion; (3) problem-solving for improvement is regularized by par- tially realistic, partly mythical beliefs, producing some misdirected intentionality; and (4) "standards of improvement" are informed by self-congratulatory commitments to the status quo. The first two aspects of Veblenian blind drift are unavoidable and necessary to the possibility of human progress. Open-ended- ness, ambiguity, and human discretion are the reasons why human beings are not the same at all times and places and can aspire to improvement. The third and fourth aspects of blind drift are connected to the hierarchies and hypocrisies of human history. The question arises, then, whether the second two aspects of blind drift are as inevitable as the first two. Uncertainty, Regularity, Partiality, and Progress Human intentionality, in Veblen's perspective, both derives from cultural processes and partially transforms them. Cultural "certainties," including myths, are real. They contribute, through the actions they more or less consistently recommend, to the regularity of social results from intentional acts. They also con- tribute to misunderstandings of actual social processes, unforeseen consequences, and continuing invidious distinctions. In confronting the dilemmas of blind drift that Veblen poses, the possibility of so- cial progress then depends on the ability to recognize gaps between the partial knowledge of privileged vantage points and actual channels of cultural cause and effect that appear in different light</page><page sequence="21">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1017 from other social locations and experiences. Uncertainty and change mean that cultural relations will always run a little ahead of cultural understandings, but they contain human potential. Myths, meanwhile, legitimate and enhance social stability but restrict cultural understanding. A vital tension exists in human cultural affairs between the forces contributing to cultural uncertainty and indeterminacy and those contributing to cultural certainty and regularity. Described in terms of the realism of cultural beliefs, neat parallels between certainty and realism or between uncertainty and unrealism can- not be found. Rather, ontological uncertainty (indeterminacy) is realistic, though realistic beliefs concerning cultural cause and ef- fect also increase certainty (regularity) [Lawson 1987]. On the other hand, unrealistic beliefs, including myths, produce uncer- tainty through misdirected intentionality but also prescribe regularized social behaviors and responses. That is, realistic beliefs and myths both abet cultural regularity and legitimation. Both realistic and mythical beliefs are similarly linked to cultural indeterminacy. Myths are invidious, however, and contribute to blind drift in ways that may be avoidable. Realism is conceived here in a provisional and contingent man- ner.23 The linkage between myths and elitist relativism suggests, however, that cultural knowledge can be improved and made more realistic through diminished partiality of vantage point. Two issues can launch the discussion of improved knowledge through lessened partiality. First, the links between cultural myth and social hierarchy are "structural" in the sense that reduc- ing the force of mythical understandings is not a matter of "chang- ing one's mind." The elements of identity, traits, and roles constituting the aspects of social hierarchy, such as race, gender, class, sexual orientation, etc., are continually reinforced through patterns of social response; they run deep in a culture's mode of life and restrict individual discretion [Harding 1987]. The ex- tenuation of social myth is then mutually contingent on processes of social change. The open-endedness of cultural evolution accom- modates both of these. Second, a question, is how Veblen's small-t teleology of in- dividual agency can permit processes of social change directed against social hierarchy and myth. Our answer has already been suggested by the historical role of social movements in modifying social belief and practice. The intensity, organization, and success</page><page sequence="22">1018 Ann Jennings and William Waller of social movements are highly variable because changes they bring about can erode their social base [e.g., see Degler 1980 on the 19th Amendment and American feminism] and because they in- crease social uncertainty and instability in cherished beliefs, often resulting in backlash.24 Movements for social change are usually constrained to stepwise processes of partial advance, backlash, and regrouping. A stepwise view of social change is also indicated by the nature of the knowledge recreation processes that must occur. Less elitist, less partial, and hence broader and more realistic knowledge evol- ves with social movements. Larger understandings require recon- ceptualizations of social relationships negotiated across differences of cultural location [Harding 1987; Longino 1992]. The partialities and errors that such a process would correct are identifiable only as the knowledge renegotiation process unfolds. While disagree- ments across vantage points may seem clear, their sources in un- conscious assumptions will be less evident. Nor will conflicts across assumptions have easy remedies, though this need not halt learning. Movement toward more inclusive knowledge involves tolerance of less universalistic knowledge and requires reassessment linked to the stepwise advance of social movements. Renegotiation is ar- duous and never complete, given ongoing cultural change. Still, it is a process by which the possibility of less invidious knowledge and less invidious social relationships-that is, social progress-can be seriously contemplated. The most invidious elements of blind drift might gradually be assuaged. Concluding Remarks Our discussion of social progress has proceeded here in cul- turally relative terms as a corrective, mainly, to elitist intracul- tural relativism. Elitist relativism confronts any cultural species more directly than the larger, more inclusive intercultural relativism that grounds all human knowledge; the latter can also be elitist (e.g., imperialism), but the materials for remedying in- tracultural elitism are fairly close to hand in the locational knowledge the culture already contains. Modes of relativistic dis- continuity are not a continuum, however; they exhibit complex feedbacks, and criticism of either can generate mutual insights and critiques of the other; this is shown by Veblen's own method.</page><page sequence="23">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1019 The present analysis of the potential for progress, as cir- cumscribed by Veblenian blind drift, is optimistic but very cautiously so. Cultural uncertainty and cultural regularity are the warp and weft of human life. Veblen's small-t teleology of in- dividual intent rests equally on both. There is no panacea for the invidiousness that abets both regularity and uncertainty. One final observation may be helpful. The grounds we offer for optimism about social progress are not the "technological process" or the community of disinterested scientists, scholars, or en- gineers sometimes associated with Ayres and Dewey. No one and no group possesses a cultural position of such "privilege." Instead, the mutual engagement of interested and culturally located per- sons and groups within a project of reeducation across the full range of cultural difference is advanced here.25 The elements of blind drift rooted in cultural complacency, self-congratulation, and hypocrisy achieve much of their obstructive effect through univer- salistic denials that social locations and relationships are impor- tant, can be positive, or are hermeneutically mutable. Difference must be embraced as a source of cumulative progress and under- standing, just as uncertainty is the precondition for human poten- tial. Notes Abandoning idle curiosity and the instinct of workmanship may seem, to some readers, a more substantial break with Veblen than we think it is. We have argued elsewhere [Jennings and Waller 1994] that Veblen used biologically based instinct psychol- ogy because (1) it was the most progressive psychol- ogy of his day, and (2) Veblen insisted on some biological foundation of human life as a rejection of mind/body dualisms. Since instinct theory has lapsed, since Veblen almost uniformly merged biological origins into cumulative cultural processes that outran biology, and since Veblen's antidualism is much bet- ter understood today, we prefer to replace idle curiosity and workmanship instincts with what we believe Veblen was most importantly connoting: human purposefulness (small-t teleology) and prob-</page><page sequence="24">1020 Ann Jennings and William Waller lem solving as the main impetus to open-ended evolu- tion and the value that Veblen placed on "efficacy."t 2. Veblen's use of instinct theories has been a ques- tionable part of his theorizing but was typical for his day [see Rutherford 1984; Jennings and Waller 1994]. Even so, Veblen consistently argued that human be- havior was not biologically determined and rejected tropismatic explanations in favor of cultural causality. The particular motivating instincts Veblen described were the parental bent (used in a gender-blind, progressive way for the era), the instinct of workman- ship, and idle curiosity. While other authors have focused on Veblen's instincts, we will largely dismiss them as artifacts of his contemporary intellectual climate. We feel he would have adopted alternative motivational theories had they been available. We find this consistent with Veblen's intent and supported in a report by C.E. Ayres on a conversation with Veblen. Ayres wrote: It was on this occasion that a conversational ex- change occurred which I have often repeated to students apropos V[eblen]'s conception of "in- stincts." He asked me point blank if I recalled exactly how he defined instincts. I was flabber- gasted, and after a long moment's soul-search- ing I replied that I couldn't recall any exact definition. He beamed, and said, "No, you can't, because I never did!" [July 18, 1966] This conversation took place by Ayres's estimation in 1920. From it we conclude that Veblen would have preferred a firmer foundation for his evolutionary theories than instincts and will therefore replace them here with an alternative conception of human motiva- tion that we believe is more fully consistent with his mainly cultural perspective on behavior. 3. Though, Sahlins [1976b] argues, evolutionary metaphors in the natural sciences were themselves originally borrowed from bourgeois cultural imagery. We will use this argument later in this essay. 4. Such reifications typically launch a search for the so- cial analogs of biological genes, or the basic units of</page><page sequence="25">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1021 "trait" inheritance, and produce debates over Dar- winian vs. Lamarckian inheritance mechanisms [Hodgson 1992]. We find both of these concerns mis- guided. Darwin vs. Lamarck is obviated in cultural analysis by the fact that cultural evolution is a con- tinuous process unlike the discrete generational process of biological evolution. Moreover, the small-t teleology of culturally motivated individuals does not converge on any Big-T Teleology in the evolution of cultural species. Nor, as we will argue later, are pro- cesses of variation and selection temporally separated in Veblenian cultural evolution. Both Lamarckian and Darwinian imagery are thus necessarily com- promised in the translation to cultural processes. The search for basic units of inheritance ("cultural genes"), on the other hand, rests partly on misunder- standings of biological evolution and on the limita- tions of technique heretofore present in studies of biological evolution. It is now widely recognized that one-to-one correspondences between genes and traits are far less frequent in biological evolution than the determination of traits by the complex interaction and codetermination of multiple genes [Falconer 1981]. Apparently studies of multiple gene-trait determination have been hampered in biology by the absence of computers large enough for the work [Per- sonal Communication with Cindy Williams, Research Biologist, U.S. Forest Service, Fairbanks, Alaska]. Thus, much genetic study still focuses on individual genes despite recognition of the importance of com- plex gene determination. Such complexity in biologi- cal evolution seems to parallel the complexity of cultural behavior and change we describe in this essay; "basic units" are misleading. 5. Cultural hermeneutic theories are described by Dies- ing [1991] and are implicit in Mirowski's [1988] in- stitutional economics. Mirowski also argues that pragmatist philosophy-the philosophical heritage of institutionalism-and hermeneutics are consistent (as does Diesing).</page><page sequence="26">1022 Ann Jennings and William Waller 6. See Bhaskar [1989] for an exceptionally intriguing critique of the potential for human knowledge within closed systems. Though he counts himself a Marxist, his critical concern with anthropomorphic thought strongly evokes Veblen's critiques of animism. 7. In Veblen's "genetic accounts," human action is paramount: ". . . it is the characteristic of man to do something.... He is a coherent structure of [cultural] propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity.... The activity it- self is the substantial fact of the process" [1898, 74]. While we will place greater weight on the continuing need of human beings to solve problems and the ex- tent to which social problems are widely recognized than on Veblen's concepts of idle curiosity and the in- stinct of workmanship in this essay, the emphasis remains on human action as the source of change in a complex cultural setting. 8. Warren Samuels [1991] has described the self- reflexive properties of Veblen's thought at some length. 9. Jim Swaney [1989] has recently reconsidered cultural understandings of the environment as "external." 10. Veblen offered his single best description of com- plexity in The Theory of the Leisure Class [1899]. Though it concerned individual complexity, the depic- tion applies equally to (and equally implies) complex cultural processes: That body of habits of thought which makes up the character of any individual is in some sense an organic whole. A marked variation in a given direction at any one point carries with it, as its correlative, a concomitant variation in the habitual expression of life in other directions or other groups of activities. These various habits of thought, or habitual expressions of life, are all phases of the single life sequence of the in- dividual; therefore a habit formed in response to a given stimulus will necessarily affect the char- acter of the response made to other stimuli. A modification of human nature at any one point</page><page sequence="27">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1023 is a modification of human nature as a whole [1899, 190]. 11. We have discussed this issue, in terms of modern dualistic cultural meanings that do prescribe the compartmentalization of "market" phenomena, at length elsewhere. See Jennings and Waller [1990a, 1990b] and Jennings [1992, 1993]. 12. Our essay emphasizes our own usages of Veblenian cultural concepts [see Jennings 1992, 1993; Jennings and Champlin 1993; Jennings and Waller 1990a, 1990b, 1994; Waller 1988] rather than specific points in Veblen or differences from Veblen. Veblen's own position and our major differences have already been noted. Our replacement of idle curiosity with human problem solving (ingenuity) and our displacement of instinct theories do imply a significant departure from the Veblenian dichotomy in discussions of evolu- tionary "improvement" however. We do not dismiss the possibility of warranted, corrigible knowledge, but link its development to increased inclusiveness in society and social knowledge-building processes and to open, engaged debate across differences of cultural location. 13. This is neither the class conflict of Marx nor Engels's dialectics of nature [see Tucker 1978, xix]. 14. While it is possible that other, culturally "inconsis- tent" variations-in the sense of seeming culturally "nonsensical" or "irrational"-could arise, they will be culturally identified as aberrant, and their agents are likely to suffer direct and immediate cultural penal- ties, as deemed fitting to the offense. It is only in this narrow sense, of eliminating some "random" varia- tions, that vestiges of Darwinian/Lamarckian distinc- tions might be retained. Such cases do reveal that cultures are a system of social control and may in general be understood as permeated by a political logic in addition to the economic logic that Veblen dis- cussed. But Darwinian/Lamarckian distinctions reveal little about "normal" (culturally explicable) processes of social evolution.</page><page sequence="28">1024 Ann Jennings and William Waller 15. Subtler examples, such the rise of the concept of "Europe" in the fifteenth century, which provided validation for imperialism at the very outset of the Age of Exploration [West 1992], and the concept of "history" in the nineteenth century [Ross 1991], also abound. The inventions of modern Western knowledge contributed to historical processes whose consequen- ces we currently confront. Third World poverty and nationalist movements, as well as notions of uncer- tainty that have entered virtually every field of academic study in the twentieth century, are among their products. 16. This usage departs from the emphasis in some in- stitutionalist accounts on "institutions" as basic social "structures" or "functional" loci [Dugger 1980; Hodgson 1992; Waller 1982]. The main justification for identifying structural/functional loci is the reduc- tionist pursuit of "basic terms" (gene analysis) in cul- tural evolution, which we reject (see endnote 4). Moreover, such compartmentalizations have often served invidious distinction [Jennings and Champlin 1993]. The only "basic terms" in our version of cultural evolution are the motive actions of individuals and their cultural context at a point in time. The context for action is not limited to a single structural/function- al domain, but includes the full range of cultural processes in which individuals are involved. Struc- tures of related habits do exist, and pressures within or between them can induce individual action, but it is whole individuals whose actions yield evolution (see the quote from Veblen in endnote 10); this also implies hermeneutic cultural holism. 17. The reification of Western cultural meanings in biological theory has not disappeared. The most dramatic recent example is Richard Dawkins's [1976] The Selfish Gene, in which individualism is "found" at the suborganism level. 18. A loose analogy for this assertion concerning partial knowledge that most economists would recognize is the case of omitted variables bias in regression.</page><page sequence="29">Evolutionary Economics and Cultural Hermeneutics 1025 19. In recent institutionalist parlance, this phenomenon is known as "ceremonial encapsulation" [Junker 1983; Bush 1986]. In Veblenian terms, such elitist relativism is supported by status emulation. As Junker [1982] noted, the antidote to such elitist relativism in knowledge is a process of open-ended and open-minded, democratic, and engaged "consen- sus building." His argument is consistent with feminist prescriptions for the reconciliation of diver- gent perspectives through a gradual and stepwise process of dialogic engagement across difference whose end in view is knowledge that is less partial and exclusionary [Harding 1987]. 20. The quote is of Hume, cited by the Marxist philosopher Bhaskar, who has also noted that "society provides the necessary conditions for intentional human activity (as well as, in any given case, to a greater or lesser extent circumscribing its form)" [1989, 77]. Veblen's reaction to this Humean conceit is recorded in his scathing depiction of neoclassical economic "agents" as "homogenous globules of desire" [1898, 73] without history or motivation. In many respects, Veblen's multiculturalism is analogous to Marx's starting point with the historical differentia specifica of social formations, although Marx's species were Western feudalism and Western capitalism. Marx lacked, however, a developed concept of culture [Kanth 1992]. 21. Many of Veblen's references to blind drift are scat- tered through Absentee Ownership: The Case of America [1923]; drift is also discussed in the final paragraph of The Theory of Business Enterprise [1904, 400]. 22. Or, in Tawney's [1926, xii] original words, "to run wil- fully in blinkers." 23. The provisional and contingent nature of "realism" has various possible philosophical groundings. Peirce's [1877, 1878] realism was, according to Mirowski [1987], the best philosophical foundation available to Veblen. Mirowski also suggests that Rorty might provide an improved foundation. We find</page><page sequence="30">1026 Ann Jennings and William Waller Bhaskar's [1989] criticisms of Rorty telling, however, and propose that Bhaskar's "critical realism" be seriously considered by institutionalists. 24. Backlash and reaction [Faludi 1991] are efforts to re- store social moorings damaged by change. Backlash benefits those whose privileges have been challenged by social movements, but its participatory base can be broader if the effects of lost moorings are widely felt or if redundancy and ambiguity do not fully accommo- date the stresses of social shifts. "Political" revolutions are usually disappointing for this reason; backlash repairs the trauma to social moorings when encom- passing new social habits and legitimate social com- mitments cannot be cut from whole cloth. As shown by recent events in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, very rapid social change can reach pro- portions that threaten social coherence and survival. 25. Perhaps the best single guide to such a process is presented in Hill Collins [1988]. Hill Collins describes knowledge building based on passionate advocacy from multiple perspectives in stark contrast to the dis- passion that passes for "objectivity" in dominant Western styles of inquiry and positivism. In the insti- tutionalist tradition, Junker's [1982] consensual re- medies for ceremonial encapsulation are closest to our views, but Junker retains elements of the Ayresian ceremonial/instrumental dichotomy, which we find more convincing as an instrument of hindsight than of foresight.
