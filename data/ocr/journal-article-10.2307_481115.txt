Cree and Inuit inter-ethnic relations are reviewed in the theoretical framework of cultural ecology, utilizing historical sources, including the archives of the Hudson's Bay Company. Three phases are analyzed: First, at time of initial contact relations were generally hostile but conflict limited by differing environmental adapta- tions that tended to keep populations apart. Second, the deliberate peacemaking efforts of the HBC were aided by unanticipated consequences of the fur trade. Third, social distance was maintained in the period of peaceful co-existence and trade. The com- plexities of the periods are noted and analyzed. The aboriginal and early contact relations between the Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit, the primary occupations of the forest and tundra west of Hudson Bay, have often been described as antagonistic, characterized by hostility and open warfare. The post journals of York Fort, the earliest historical documents relating to this period (HBC B 249/a/ 1-3), only parts of which have been published (Knight 1932), do indeed indicate that interethnic relations were characterized by animosity. Glover (1969:xlv), however, noted that the relationship changed through time and Janes (1973:39-54) recently reviewed the published literature, suggesing that hostility was but one aspect of a more complex relationship. Bishop and Ray (1976:116-144), in their paper developing a model chronology for the southerly Central Subarctic,' give emphasis to the "middle man" phase of indirect contact, and by implication suggest that the various Indian societies acted as middle men between themselves and the Inuit. It is periodically appropriate to reexamine old statements that may reflect a standardized ethnographic error, and to reinterpret on the basis of newly exposed data, of new concepts, or of reorganization of the data. In this paper I review the history of interethnic relations immediately to the west of Hudson Bay, based in part upon the published and unpublished literature, principally the archives of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and from the conceptual framework of cultural ecology. With the intrusion of the Europeans with limited colonial goals, subsequently enlarged as the Native Americans were drawn into the structure of the Canadian state, we see the gradual shift from autonomous bands and nations to dependent ethnic groups in the Canadian "vertical mosaic" (Porter 1965). ETHNOHISTORY 28/2 (Spring 1981) 133</page><page sequence="2">134 JAMES G. E. SMITH In this paper I suggest that there were four major rough historical periods in terms of international relations between Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit and note the relations of the Europeans with the native peoples. The first period was that of aboriginal-earliest direct contact, characterized by hostility and warfare. The second was one of peace making by the HBC, extending from about 1714 to roughly 1800, the exact time depending on local circumstances. The third was that of peaceful coexistence, during which some individuals and groups became middle men in the fur trade. The final period is the modem one, in which the Native peoples were resettled in multi-ethnic communities. Only brief reference is made in this paper to the modem period. Frontiers at the Time of Earliest European Contact A common view of Chipewyan-Cree boundaries holds that the Chipewyan moved from the Peace River valley region to the edge of the Barren Lands following the establishment of the HBC coastal forts in the late 17th century. First expressed by Petitot (1885:47), who ascribed it to Chipewyan legend, it was accepted by the authors of the original Handbook of North American Indians (Hodge 1907-1910), and uncritically accepted by numerous scholars since then. It has become a standardized ethnographic error. Why Chipewyan should move from the fur rich boreal forest to the fur deficient taiga-tundra ecotone was never explained. This position has been rebutted by Gillespie (1975a:352-358) and Smith (1975a:410-414). Recent archaeological surveys, excavations and reviews by Burch (1978), Gordon (1975, 1976), Minni (1976), Nash (1975), Noble (1970, 1975) and Wright (1975) support the interpretations of Chipewyan distributions indicated by Gillespie and Smith, indicated below. Briefly, the Chipewyan (including the Yellowknives) exploited the taiga-tundra ecotone from the Seal River (approximately 59? North Latitude) through the southern Keewatin (about 64? North), westward to Great Slave and Great Bear lakes, and north to the vicinity of the mouth of the Coppermine River. Beginning in the late 18th century, some Chipewyan moved as far south as the Churchill River. A similar standardized error holds that the Swampy Cree had been located east of Lake Winnipeg until the use of muskets obtained from the French and English after about 1670 permitted them to wage a Blitzkrieg against an unidentified enemy to the west, conquering their lands as far west as the Peace River. This error has been criticized by Smith (1976a), who found that aboriginal Western Woods Cree exploited the Churchill River drainage system within the full boreal forest. The Rocky Cree extended from near the mouth of the Churchill River, north and west of the Nelson River through what is now, roughly, north-central Saskatchewan. To the west were the Athabasca Cree, deriving their name from the lake that was their aboriginal northern boundary. Still further west were the Bois Fort or Strongwoods Cree extended somewhere to the east of the Peace River. Archaeologically, Selkirk pottery is diagnostic of Cree and is found at Southern Indian Lake (Wright 1968), Reindeer Lake (Downes 1938:48), and at Lac la Ronge and Cree Lake (Wright, personal communication); it is never found north of Lake Athabasca (Wright 1975). The Inuit, who came to be known as the Caribou Eskimo, did not occupy the tundra of the southern Keewatin in late prehistoric or early historic times. They appear to have</page><page sequence="3">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 135 had a maritime-inland adaptation along the Arctic Ocean and along the northwest coast of Hudson Bay, perhaps venturing as far south as the mouth of the Churchill on rare occasions. The Copper Inuit were in closest proximity to the Chipewyan (Yellowknives), as both exploited the raw copper resources that gave the Coppermine River its name. The movement of the Inuit into the caribou country of the southern Keewatin occurred principally in the 19th century as a result of factors involving the fur trade and its consequences (Burch 1978; Smith and Burch 1979). Ecological Adaptations and Subsistence Strategies Each of the societies involved in this study occupied distinctive econiches, the exploitation of which rarely brought them into contact except by accident or on the occasion of deliberate war parties. The Cree at the time of initial contact at York Fort, founded in 1682, occupied the full boreal forest in which the major big game animals were the moose (Alces alces) and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Larger fur bearers, such as the beaver (Castor canadensis), were probably used for food and for the fur, the bear (Ursus americanus) was used for food and fur but probably of greater importance ritually, and smaller fur bearers did not become significant until after the advent of the fur trade. The hunters then and now considered the snaring of hares to be the work of children and women done in the vicinity of the camp. Fishing was also allocated to the women, according to David Thompson (1916:122), who wrote of the 1790s: . . . nothing but sad necessity can compel a Nahathaway [Cree] hunter to carry away fish, and angle for them, this is too mean for a hunter; meat he carries with pleasure, but fish is degradation. A chief characteristic of the animal species that provided the basis of Cree subsistence was their relatively sedentary nature, with only the woodland caribou migrating moderate distances from winter to summer foraging ranges. The subsistence base consisted, then, of sedentary or moderately nomadic game and produced a Restricted Wandering exploita- tion pattern, although one subject to such variation as imposed by fluctuations or oscillations of the game populations that were the frequent cause of social realignments (cf. Rossignol 1939:61-70; Waisberg 1975:170-185). The annual cycle was one of summer concentration on the shores of lakes, to which both man and animal came to escape the hordes of black flies and mosquitoes and where fish were abundant. Winter was the time when human dispersion matched the dispersal of the game, with the small hunting group or local band as the primary social unit. (I have in preparation a manuscript that considers in detail Cree adaptive strategies through time.) The Chipewyan exploited the taiga-tundra ecotone, the zone being identical to the range of the migratory and nomadic barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groen- landicus L.) (Symington 1965; Kelsall 1968; Parker 1972), on which they were so completely dependent that those who remained in their traditional lands became known as the Caribou Eaters or et-en-eldili-dene. The eastern bands of Chipewyan who wintered in the forest north of Lake Wollaston, Reindeer Lake and Seal River were predators upon the three herds of the Kaminuriak Population of barren-ground caribou; those bands north of Stony Rapids and northwest to Great Slave Lake exploited the herds of the Beverly</page><page sequence="4">136 JAMES G. E. SMITH Population, while the Yellowknives to the north were dependent upon the herds of the Bathurst Population and utilized the raw copper found at the mouth of the Coppermine River. As the herds migrated from the tundra to the forest, the Chipewyan took them in great numbers near the migratory path in early winter, then dispersed into smaller groups as the herds dispersed in the winter foraging ranges. When the herds began their migration to the tundra, they were again killed in great numbers on the migratory path to the northern calving grounds where the lakes give them the names by which the major populations are known. Summers were spent on the Barrens, and in late summer (August-early September) caribou were killed in quantity for their hides, which were of maximum quality for making into clothing, lodge coverings and other items. Of primary concern here is the distribution of the caribou and the Chipewyan, which was primarily near the treeline during the winter. Only when the distribution of the caribou, and the size of the herds, was at maximum would the Chipewyan have reason to be on the southern margin of their zone of exploitation where they might accidentally encounter the Cree. The ecological basis of Chipewyan socio-territorial organization is considered elsewhere in greater detail (Smith 1975a, 1976b, 1978). It is not clear whether historically the ranges of the barren-ground and woodland varieties of caribou overlapped. Intensive studies have been made of the former sub- species, but not of the latter. In recent times at least, it appears that woodland caribou are not found in the environs of Reindeer Lake or north of Southern Indian Lake in northern Manitoba, which represent the normal southern extension of the barren-ground variety. Since the Cree did not normally hunt the barren-ground caribou and the Chipewyan did not pursue the woodland caribou, a natural barrier seems to have prevented regular contact between the two peoples until well into historic times. Only the Cree bands along the lower Churchill River were in reasonable proximity to the Chipewyan of the lower Seal River. The Inuit of the Central Arctic had the well known dual economy of winter adjustment to the sea mammals such as the various species of seal (Erignathus barbatus, Halichoerus grypus, Phoca vitulina L., P. hispida and P. groenlandicus) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and a summer pattern of exploitation of fish and caribou. The Inuit of concern in this paper are those known historically as the Copper Eskimo and those of the northwestern coast of Hudson Bay, including those who may have been in part ancestral to the Caribou Eskimo of later history. The maritime-inland adaptation of the Inuit has been analyzed in great depth recently by Damas (cf., 1972, 1973, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c), as well as by earlier writers. The important point here is that there were few areas across the Indian-Inuit interface where contact was likely to take place. For the Cree and Inuit the only reasonable possibility was on the coast north of Churchill where the Inuit might come to hunt the Churchill herd of caribou or if they came to the mouth of the Churchill in search of iron in the remains of Jens Munk's abandoned ships. Contact between Chipewyan and Inuit was likely only around the mouth of the Coppermine River, where both the Yellowknives and Inuit came to obtain the raw copper and where both might be hunting the scattered herds of the Bathurst Population during the summer. Another less probable area was again north of the Churchill River where both might have occasionally exploited the Churchill herd, which does not move into the forest during the winter and which was not customarily of interest to the Chipewyan. In any case, there is no substantial evidence that Inuit were regular occupants of the southern Keewatin at the dawn of recorded history.</page><page sequence="5">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 137 In general, the different adaptations to their environment precluded more than rare, chance encounters of Indians and Inuit. In the vast expanse of the barren lands, a potential enemy would be visible at a relatively great distance, with ample opportunity for evasion, while near the treeline the smoke of the Indian fires would be warning to the Inuit of potential trouble. International Relations in the Aboriginal and Early Contact Period This period, characterized by a Hobbesian state of "Warre" among the native peoples may be taken as extending from the 16th century to 1715, the latter date marking the first successful peacemaking expedition by the HBC. Historical data for the period are minimal, but sufficient to indicate the major quality of the relations. Aside from the early explorations of the west coast of Hudson Bay by Thomas Button in 1613, Jens Munk in 1619-20 and Luke Foxe in 1631, who did not encounter any people in the area, historical records begin with the establishment of York Fort by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1682. York was founded for trade with the Cree, near the mouths of the Nelson and Hayes rivers, but was also intended as a center for trade and exploration of a much larger region. Other peoples were known to the English from the Cree, particularly in this context the 'Northern Indians" or Chipewyan with whom no contacts were possible because of the state of hostility that prevailed. The Cree, according to Chipewyan legend, informed the English that the Chipewyan were subhuman and had tails and the English became aware of their human qualities only after a captured slave woman escaped and impressed them with her human qualities and beauty. Subsequently the English purchased slave women and boys from the Cree and gained at least some minimal knowledge of the direction in which the Chipewyan were to be found. Because of the hostilities, it was early planned to establish a fort at the mouth of Churchill River for this new trade, a project that was not accomplished until 1717. In 1689, the young Henry Kelsey (1929:25) was sent to locate and bring to trade the "northern Indians Inhabiting to ye Northward of Churchill River &amp; also ye dogside [Dogrib] Nation." Kelsey, guided by one of the captured and ransomed Chipewayan slave boys, proceeded north along the coast, probably in the area of Eskimo Point. There Kelsey was forced to return to York without encountering Chipewyan, for his guide was increasingly fearful of encountering hostile Eskimo. No further attempts were made to meet Chipewyan in their own land until 1715, although the English continued to learn of them from an apparently continuing supply of redeemed slaves. During the French occupation of York, which was rebuilt a short distance away and renamed Fort Bourbon (1694-96, 1697-1714), the French commandant N. Jeremie ( 1926:20-21) observed that the Chipewyan were located to the north of the Seal River and that the area to the south was occupied by the Cree. He noted also a state of hostility existed, and his knowledge of the Chipewyan was derived from Cree slaves. It is uncertain if he knew about the Inuit, who may have been far to the north. With the return of York to the British in 1714, following the Treaty of Utrecht ending the War of the Spanish Succession, Captain James Knight was named governor- in-chief in the Bay. He later wrote, in 1716, that he had discussed his intention of making</page><page sequence="6">138 JAMES G. E. SMITH peace in the region, but that Jeremie laughed and replied that when he had been governor he had done all in his power to prevent war and make peace, but had been completely unsuccessful (HBC B.42/b/ 1 1, fo. 29 d.). Knight examined several boys captured by Cree on the peacemaking expedition of 1715-16 (cf., infra) and wrote (HBC B.239/a/2, fo. 26 d.): . .. they tell me they have abundance of people still but the Indians [Creel as Destroyd a great many thousands of them and that there Country is Rich in Furrs and that they have a great deal of Copper in it.... The estimate of many thousands having been killed is undoubtedly a gross exaggeration, since the Chipewyan probably have never numbered more than 5,000 until the 1970s (Smith, in press). Nevertheless, it is clear that raids by Cree were common, and Knight wrote further (ibid.) yett this [peace] might have been done 20 or 30 Years ago ten times easier and with 40 times less Charge and 5 or 6 thousand Mens Lives might have been Savd as has been cutt of Since the English settld here before they came to Supply these Indians [Creel with Guns they kept at a Distance thse Northern Indians are 5 times as many but I cannot Understand there ever was peace betwixt them. A few days later, May 8, 1716, Knight talked with some Chipewyan who had returned with the peacemaking party. They asserted that the Chipewyan had made peace with other unnamed Indians, presumably Athapaskan speakers, to the west in the preceeding summer (HBC B.239/a/2, fo. 29 d.): to join all against thee common Enemy that Destroys them all wch is our [Creel Indians those Rogues that come to trade with us and getts guns, for they Poor people have none but are forced to to live by there bows and Arrows and they cannot live a great many together because they have nothing to Subsist on but what they hunt and our brutes follows them in Winter by there tracks in the Snow and kills a great many of them every Year.... Knight here probably grossly exaggerates the importance of the gun in this warfare, for the trade musket was not effective at more than short range, was prone to breakage, apt to misfire more often than not and difficult to keep supplied with ball and shot at any great distance from the fort. On May 12, 1716, Knight reported that twelve canoes of "Great Water Indians," i.e., Cree of the Missinippi or Churchill River, had arrived and that (HBC B.239/a/2, fo. 32) "These Indians had killed abt. 14 Tents of them [Copper or Yellowknife Indians] they lay abt WNWt...." Warfare was not apparently confined to the Cree and Chipewyan, for on May 30, 1716 Knight (HBC B.239/a/2, fo. 34 d.) wrote that the Northern Indians said there were twelve "nations" (bands?) that were their friends, four of which had copper, but there were three "nations" that bordered on them with which they were perpetually at war. The latter groups reportedly spoke three different languages, of which the Chipewyan could not understand a word. But hostile relations between culturally and linguistically distinct neighboring societies were not apparently an absolute rule. Thanadelther, the famous Slave Woman who guided the peacemaking expedition of 1715-16, told Knight after her return (HBC B.239/a/3, February 5, 1717)</page><page sequence="7">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 139 . . . but two years before she went to make the peace and that they [a group of Chipewyan] had seen them Indians as had hoops around there heads &amp; handcuffs of yellow Mettle that did not understand one another word but by Signs they made to each other they was very Good Friends when they parted and feasted one another. Since they could not understand one another's speech, the possibility that these strange "Indians" were Yellowknives is ruled out, and it is unlikely that they were Athapaskan speakers, it seems that they may have been the ancestors of the historic Copper Inuit. In the vast area from Churchill to the mouth of the Coppermine River it is not inconceivable that some individuals or local bands might have developed occasional non-hostile trade relations with one another. Relations of the Indian societies with the Inuit are largely known from later sources, although it is evident that they were primarily hostile. Kelsey had been forced to abandon his attempt to find the Chipewyan in 1689 because his Chipewyan guide feared their increasing proximity to Inuit lands, although it is not clear how familiar he was with the territory. J6remie's (1926) account of his twenty years in Hudson Bay is vague on the question of Inuit distribution on the west side of the Bay, but certainly they were not regularly in the immediate vicinity of the Churchill River. The Period of Peacemaking by the Hudson's Bay Company, 1715-1815 During the French regime J&amp;ermie had attempted without success to make peace in the region, and Knight had discussed with him his plans. He (Knight 1932:57) promptly set about this mission of "Endeavoring to make a peace in the whole Country Round, from N to SWt for 1000 miles," but it was a full century before that goal was realized. While peace was soon made between Cree bands near the coast and the Chipewyan, it was not until the 1750s that the Cree of the Athabasca district were persuaded to establish amicable relations. Hostilities continued between Yellowknives and Inuit in the distant hinterland until the early 19th century. British colonialism, as represented by the Hudson's Bay Company in the Territory granted in the Royal Charter of 1670, was of a very limited nature. In exchange for the furs that were highly valued in Europe the Native peoples were provided with valuable trade goods, particularly metal tools and other items of personal adornment. The British traders made little effort to alter the culture of the Indian societies that they encountered; on the contrary, their motives were restricted to providing equipment that would make subsistence easier so that more time was available for the pursuit of the fur bearing animals. Unlike the French, no effort was made to carry on missionary activities nor to impose British law and administration on the aboriginal populations. If the HBC were to profitably carry on the trade, peaceful relations among the Native peoples were essential. Time diverted from hunting fur bearers to war parties was time lost and fears of trading parties required to travel through enemy lands was inhibiting. Therefore, peace was the most desirable state of affairs but an otherwise only slightly altered culture was ideal. (a) Chipewyan and Cree York Fort or Factory was situated in the lands occupied by people later known as the Maskegan or Swampy Cree, and marginal to the Rocky Cree of the Churchill drainage.</page><page sequence="8">140 JAMES G. E. SMITH In order to bring the distant Chipewyan to trade it was essential that peace be made between them and the Cree and that a new fort be established in greater proximity to the Northern Indians where contact between the two nations would be minimal. The state of relations between the two groups is perhaps indicated by the names by which they still know one another: to the Chipewyan the Cree are still ena or enemy, to the Cree their northern neighbors are cipewayanuk or "pointed tails," the significance of which is uncertain but may refer to their belief, as purportedly stated to the Company staff, that the Chipewyan were subhuman.2 As far as the literature, including the Company archives, indicates, the only Chipewyan to visit York Fort were women and boys who had been captured, enslaved by the Cree and who escaped or were ransomed by the Company. In general, Chipewyan avoided areas in which Cree were likely to be present in substantial numbers. To remedy this situation, Knight determined to send one of his men, guided by a former Cree slave, and accompanied by a party of Cree to conclude a peace. There was some delay, as his chosen guide and emissary died, but he was fortunate in obtaining the services of the Thanadelther of Chipewyan legend and the Slave Woman of the Company records (cf. Johnson 1952; Davies 1969; Van Kirk 1974). In June, 1715, Knight sent William Stewart (or Stuart), guided by Thanadelther and accompanied by 150 Cree men to find the Chipewyan, make peace and persuade them to come to trade at the new fort to be established at the mouth of the Churchill River. While Stewart kept no journal of his remarkable expedition, he, Thanadelther, and various Chipewyan and Cree were interrogated at various times by Knight, who recorded their reports in the York Fort post journal (HBC B.239/a/2, passim). Stewart's party proceeded northwest from the Churchill River, apparently remaining near the forest. With the onset of winter, the party was forced to separate into smaller groups because of problems of subsisting by hunting when game was not plentiful. One such group returned a short time before the main body, and one member reported to Knight (HBC B.239/a/2, fo. 24): he was nere the Indians as they went to look after for Quickly he came upon a great many of the Northern Indians tracks and Quickly found a Tent wth Seven Men &amp; 6 Women besides Severall children &amp; some of them pretty bigg boys but they had discovered there Smoke it being very Cold Sharp Clear Weather and was fledd but they pursued them &amp; came up with them but was forced to kill some of them in there own Defence or they would have killed them wch they Endeavourd to do but when they found there was no coming at them but with the hazard there Lives rather then to kill more of them they left them go away and Contented themselves wth the women &amp; Children wch they stayd 2 Days at there Tent then Agreed to Return back again bringing with them four women and four boys 2 of them about 20 Years Old &amp; 2 younger and a Girl they left one Woman and a large Boy to go to there Countrymen and tell them they did not come to warr with them but as friends and to make peace with them wch they had no other way to Express then by throwing there bayyonets on the Ground flatways &amp; breaking there Arrows &amp; turning the Muzzell of there Guns from them for they could not Understand them a word. On May 6, 1716, Knight (ibid., fo. 26 d.) queried the Chipewyan boys: both of them told me they had been at Churchill River to look for Iron out of the Ship [Munk's abandoned vessel] as was broke up there but they did not come very often for fear of there Enemies they had been killd Sevll times by there going there. On May 7th, Stewart, Thanadelther and the Cree Captain returned with the main body of the expedition. They had encountered the Chipewyan, probably somewhere in</page><page sequence="9">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 141 the vicinity of the east arm of the Great Slave Lake, but only with great difficulty was Thanadelther (who had gone on ahead) able to bring her countrymen to Stewart and the Cree. She had found more than "400 and had brought with her about 160 Men the Cleverest as ever he [Stewart] see in his Life" (ibid., fo. 27). Later, Knight (ibid., fo. 28 d.) reported "the Woman told me she found above a 100 Tents of her Country Men in the time as she was Absent from the Capt &amp; Wm Stewart." She also said there is a great many People in them Country and that there are 2 or 3 Nations that they do not Understand some of them to the Norward and some to the SWt besides the Iskemays they live most to the Seaward on Whales Seals and Seahorse. The Chipewyan group that Thanadelther reported is remarkable in size, as 100 tents meant about 800 to 1000 individuals, since we know from other sources (Jenness 1956:16; Heame 1958:passim) that the typical lodge contained two hunters, wives, children and frequently superannuated kin. Such a population aggregation could occur at times when caribou aggregated in large numbers (Kelsall 1968:108 ff.). The peace which Stewart and Thanadelther negotiated between this large body of Chipewyan, undoubtedly representing a number of regional bands, and the Cree, representing some of the bands near the coast, was relatively binding on those groups. The peace was, however, tenuous for some years and the agreement not binding (or enforceable) among the Cree of the western interior, many of whom had no direct contact with the Company and were not represented in the peace party. A formal state of peace, perhaps better described as peaceful co-existence, did not necessarily mean that amicable interpersonal relations were established, only that the state of war was reduced. When Fort Churchill was founded at the mouth of the Churchill River it was with the intent to keep the traditional enemies separated. This proved impossible, since the Churchill River was the most convenient route to a trading center for the Cree of that region and the alternative Fort York required major detours. For example, in June, 1721, forty canoes of Churchill River Cree who came were told they should go to York, but they refused on grounds of convenience and that they had made peace (HBC B.42/a/2, fo. 133). Occasional hostilities continued in the hinterland. On June 13, 1725, 104 Chipewyan arrived at Churchill and "they accquainted me that the Southern Upland Indians [Cree] had been to Warrs in their Country Last winter &amp; had Destroyed a Vast quantity of their Countrey men and a great many of those Natives familys which Came here" (HBC B.42/a/5, fo. 24d.). The following year those "Upland Indians" came in and were severely chastised by the Chief Factor at Churchill (HBC B.42/a/6, June 20, 1726). There were other periods during which the Company feared that warfare might occur. In September 1723, the chief at Churchill sent the "Boy Norton" (HBC B.42/a/ 1, fo. 23): to winter with the Indians [Cree] to divert 'em from going to warr, &amp; to desire 'em to go to trade at York Fort and not to come here for they should not have any Encouragement. In this effort Norton was apparently successful, for there is no record of war in that period. However, on July 13th, Churchill received news (HBC B.42/a/4, fo. 32) "... of a Gang of home Indians Coming from York Fort," and two days later (ibid., fo. 32d.) they arrived with a letter from the Governor "... wch Acquainted me of their Intent wch is their Going to Warrs wth ye Eskimoes ..." (perhaps as an alternative to Chipewyan), which plan was thwarted by the Company. Detailed information on the interor is lacking for this period, as exploration of the western hinterland was limited. In 1690-1691, Kelsey (1929) made his celebrated trip</page><page sequence="10">142 JAMES G. E. SMITH from York Factory to the northern plains, but there is no pertinent information in his account of the journey. The same is true of the journeys of Hendry [or Henday] in 1754-55 (Burpee 1907) to the Blackfeet and Cocking's of 1772-73 (Burpee 1908), both were too far south to have occasion to note Cree relations to the Chipewyan, far to the north. Hearne (1958:222-228), however, discussed the life of his friend and guide to the lower Coppermine, Matonabbee, who in his youth had been sent by Governor Ferdinand Jacobs "as an Ambassador and Mediator between the Northern Indians and the Athapuscow Tribe, who till then had always been at war with each other" (ibid.:225). Matonabbee' s peacemaking efforts with the Athabasca Cree took several years, probably in the late 1750s and perhaps into the early 1760s, but were ultimately successful. The Athabasca Cree were first mentioned by name in a letter from Ferdinand Jacobs, Governor at Churchill, to James Isham, Governor at York, in 1755, when he wrote (HBC B.42/6/16) that "many of ye Athapuscow Indians not coming down to Trade. " A further reference was made by Jacobs (HBC B.42/b/l 1, fo. 3d., September 8, 1764) to the Athabasca Cree in a letter to Moses Norton, then Governor at Churchill: . . . am Sorry your Trade has Disapointed your Expectations but I have good reason to believe the Trade at both these Factorys will be more Next year being well informed that Several of yr A'thup'pis'caw Indians will come down to Trade, Next year Particularly to your Factory. The inference to be drawn from these quotations on the Athabasca Cree is that they had not been regular visitors, nor come in substantial numbers in earlier years. This in turn suggests that the Cree of the Churchill River drainage were probably acting as middle men in the fur trade, with the Company having little power of persuasion or coercion in peacemaking efforts. Indeed, we may question the extent to which the Company was responsible for peaceful coexistence, and other factors of greater importance. Various Indian nations were capable of making peace among themselves, for in, 1723 Richard Staunton wrote in the Churchill journal that he had interviewed the "leading Indian" of the Upland Cree that (HBC B.42/a/3, fo. 28d): . . . having been this Winter Makeing Peace with Strange Indians that Never see no Europeans &amp; brought one of the men here wth him wch wee Show'd our Goods to and Gave them some Small presents, telling them withall to bring Cannoes of those Strange Natives Next Spring, the Language of those Strangers being very Much like our Nothern Indians that come here to trade. But peace was apparently rather tenuous, and probably relatively binding only on the band for which the leader was spokesman, for the next year Staunton interviewed the same "leading Indian" who reported (HBC B.42/a/4, fo. 29): . . . He Acquainting mee he has Seen any thing of him since but was afraid he had fell into the hands of his Enemys who has killed in Going back into his own Country and he Could not goe into their Country without Blood Sheed wch he was not Willing to doe. The identity of these "Strange Indians" is unknown, other than that they were Athapaskan speakers. In 1789, Alexander Mackenzie explored the western Cree district as he began his journey to the north along the river that bears his name; he noted that the Peace River derives its name from a peace established without direct reference to European intervention:</page><page sequence="11">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 143 When this country was formerly invaded by the Knisteneaux [Cree], they found the Beaver Indians inhabiting the land about Portage la Loche; and the adjoining tribe were those whom they called Slaves. They drove both these tribes before them; when the latter proceeded down the river from the Lake of the Hills, in consequence of which that part of it obtained the name of the Slave River. The former proceeded up the river; and when the Knisteneaux made peace with them, this place was settled to be the boundary (Mackenzie 1927:240). While Mackenzie did not give a date to the peace established between the Cree and their Athapaskan neighbors, Peter Pond (Innis 1930:119-120), who wintered south of Lake Athabasca in 1778, indicates it was well within the forty years preceding his visit. Although the details of peacemaking in the west will never be known, some attention to the possible mechanisms will be considered in the conclusions of this paper. (b) Cree and Inuit Relations Contact between Cree and Inuit was possible only along the Bay coast north of Churchill, where they could encounter by chance when visiting the site of Jens Munk's abandoned vessel in search of iron or when the Cree deliberately went on war parties to the north. The traditional Cree term for the Inuit, in local dialect, is eskimir, meaning eaters of raw meat; their term for themselves is iiiniwuk, meaning true or real people. The Inuit term for themselves means, of course, people; their term for the Cree is unali't, having a root that refers to belligerency. Implied in the Cree terms is a Levi-Straussian opposition between the raw and the cooked, animal versus man and nature versus culture. Documentation of Cree and Inuit interaction is extremely limited. The Rocky Cree who exploit the lower Churchill drainage probably spent little time near the coast until after the establishment of the Company's Bayside forts. The Swampy Cree who sub- sequently traded at York Fort were a considerable distance from the area in which there was any likelihood that Inuit could be found. While few specific references to warfare are found, they do exist although those that mention "Indians," given the context, most probably designate Chipewyan. In 1724, a "gang" of Home Guard Indians from York Fort arrived at Churchill with the intention of "Going to warrs wth ye Eskimoes" (HBC B.42/a/4, fo. 33), but they were dissuaded by the Governor. With peace between the Cree and Chipewyan, and the establishment of Fort Churchill for trade with the latter, a barrier was interposed between the Cree and Inuit. We find no further references to outright conflict, although the hostile attitudes are reflected in numerous sources. For example, in the early 19th century Chappell ( 1817:166) wrote: The different [Indian] tribes have frequent wars with each other; and they appear to agree unanimously in one respect only, that is to say, in universal and eternal hatred of the Eskimaux. However, it fortunately happens, from the contrariety of their modes of life, that their parties seldom come into contact with each other and consequently the battles between them are very rare. By 1815 the district reports of Churchill (HBC B.42/e/5-8) indicate that the Inuit were coming annually to trade, without molestation by Chipewyan or Cree, although relations were reserved and continued to be so until the contemporary period. (c) Chipewyan and Inuit Relations The state of Chipewyan-Inuit relations at the dawn of history was apparently one of mutual fear and hostility. The Chipewyan term for the Inuit is otel'ena or enemy of the</page><page sequence="12">144 JAMES G. E. SMITH lowlands (i.e., the Barrens), while they refer to themselves as people, dene. Similarly the Inuit term for the Chipewyan is itqili-t or "louse eggs" (Birket-Smith 1929:155), and their word for themselves means people. In 1689, Kelsey's attempt to locate the Chipewyan had been aborted when his young guide became fearful of possible proximity to the Eskimo. In July 1717, Knight (1932:59) recorded a Chipewyan report that Inuit had ambushed a party of nine Chipewyan returning from trade and had killed six of them. In August he recorded that Chipewyan returning from trade at York (ibid.: 152) "had gott so far of their way as to Churchill River they met with a great number of Iskemays which fear hath cutt six of them."'' In 1720 Chipewyan reported at Churchill that they had been attacked and several killed byInuit (HBC B.42/a/1, fo. 81), but in 1721 some Chipewyan related that they had made peace with some "Esquimaux" and had traded knives and awls for copper lances and arrowheads. But peace was tenuous, for in 1724 the Churchill post journal (HBC B.42/a/5, fo. 25) recorded the arrival of 105 Chipewyan: They also telling me 'ye Esquemoys had been to warr with them &amp; had Murdered Severall of them.. .. then they askt me whether they must Stand Still &amp; be Knockt on the head Like Doggs or fight in their own Defence or now by Reason we had ordered them not to warr with any Natives. The Company found its peacemaking efforts relatively unsuccessful and in 1738 abandoned the policy of drawing the Inuit of the west coast of the Bay to Churchill to trade and thereafter trade was carried on by ship (Williams 1969:214, fn. 1). In 1748, on the basis of questionable knowledge, Swaine (1748,11:43-44) wrote perhaps optimistically that warfare had ended, and described the Chipewyan rationale for war against the Inuit: The Indians are inclineable to go to war; if there is a bad Season of hunting, or if any of their People is missing, or that they have a Sickness amongst them, they must prepare in Spring to go out and seek out the Eskemaux, and make a Carnage of them; for they attribute to them the Cause of their Misfortunes. It is the Eskemaux that have killed their Friend; it the Eskemaux have kept the Dear away; and the Sickness is occasion'd by a Charm or Witchery of the Eskemaux. Peaceful relations were, in fact, developing along the coast, however tenuously. The attack on Inuit by Chipewyan at Knapp's Bay in 1755 was an aberrancy precipitated by the outrage of the Chipewyan who had to travel great distances overland and on foot to reach Churchill, while the Company sent the sloop to trade with the Inuit in their own land (HBC B.42/a/47, fo. 2-3). In general by the mid- 18th century peace was characteristic of the coastal region. In the distant hinterland, however, the matter was still different, although more complex than has generally been recognized. On Samuel Hearne's monumental trip of exploration to find the source of the copper at the mouth of the Coppermine River, he was joined by many Chipewyan who had "no other intent than to murder the Esquimaux" (Hearne 1958:73-74). His graphic description of the massacre of Inuit at Bloody Falls, in 1771, to which he was an unwilling witness (ibid.:95-105) is largely the basis of European descriptions of Chipewyan-Inuit relations as perpetually hostile. But in an apparently ignored footnote, Hearne (ibid. :224) noted: I must here observe, that when we went to war with the Esquimaux at the Copper River in July 1771. it was by no means his [Matonabbee's] proposal: on the contrary, he was forced into it by his countrymen. For I have heard him say, that when he first visited that river, in company with I-dot-le-aza, they met with several Esquimaux; and so far from</page><page sequence="13">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 145 killing them, were very friendly to them, and made them small presents of such articles as they could best spare, and that would be of the most use to them. In other words, while hostility characterized the attitudes of Chipewyan and Cree, it was not impossible for individuals or small groups to interact in amity, or for war and peace to alternate. Akaitcho, the greater leader of the Yellowknives, told Captain Franklin (Gillespie 1975a:2 17) that the last Yellowknife raid on the Copper Inuit had occurred about 1811. The last hostile incident on record was reported in the Churchill post journal of 1818 (HBC B.42/a/ 144, fo. 2), noting that a Chipewyan had said his companions had been plundered by Inuit. The decline in hostilities at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th was due to factors other than direct efforts of the Company to make peace. The Yellowknives were no longer exploiting the region near the mouth of the Coppermine River, iLaving found a new and more profitable role as middle men in the fur trade, between Churchill and the subsequently established interior forts of the Company and the partnerships of Montreal that eventually formed the North West Company, and the Dogribs. This new role oriented the Yellowknives to the area between Great Slave and Great Bear lakes, rather than to the northeast of the latter lake, and left a substantial territory between them and the Copper Inuit (Gillespie 1975a:214-218). The Yellow- knive's domineering attitude toward the Dogribs eventually led to war, in which the Yellowknives were defeated and their reduced numbers afflicted by two epidemics, one of influenza, the other unidentified (ibid. :221-222). The Chipewyan, who had earlier occupied the middle man position between the Company and the Yellowknives, Dogribs and perhaps other Athapaskan peoples (Glover 1965:xxix-xxxvi), were developing a more southerly orientation that led to the gradual abandonment of the further reaches of the Barrens. A number of factors led to this. First was the establishment of inland forts by the Company and its competitors, beginning in the 1770s. These trading posts were often far more convenient for the Chipewyan than Churchill, but they were also in positions which the Chipewyan's erstwhile customers could reach, thus eliminating their lucrative middle man role. Related to this was the encouragement given them to move into the full boreal forest where fur bearers were more abundant. In 1781 the great smallpox epidemic struck the Chipewyan who had hitherto been spared the ravages of European introduced epidemic diseases. Heame (1958:115 fn.) estimated that ninety percent of the Chipewyan died from the smallpox, but his estimate probably refers to the bands closest to Churchill, for large numbers of them were subsequently moving into the forest (Gillespie 1975b:374). Equally significant, large numbers of Cree had been carried off by the same epidemic, David Thompson ( 1916:323) estimating that two-thirds had died. The northern ranges of Creelands were depopulated as the survivors concentrated in the Churchill River area. Their lands were gradually taken over for hunting fur bearers by the Chipewyan, and in many areas the Cree did not return until the late 19th or 20th centuries (Smith 1975b). Finally, in 1782 Fort Churchill (then known as Prince of Wales Fort) was captured by a French naval expedition under the Comte de La Perouse and destroyed, as was York. The forts were restored the following year, but the effect must have been catastrophic on the Native populations dependent upon them, at this particular time.</page><page sequence="14">146 JAMES G. E. SMITH The net effect of these events of the late 18th century was to establish a human vacuum in the northern portion of the southern Keewatin and in the region of the Coppermine River. By this time too, relations between the Inuit and Chipewyan were, on the whole, peaceful and it was possible for Inuit populations to move into the vacated territories without great fear. It is necessary to evaluate historical documents for this period, since they contain limited data and are undoubtedly biased in several directions. First, the Company's knowledge of Chipewyan-Inuit relations was based on information supplied by the Chipewyan, who invariably professed to be the innocent victims of Inuit attack. Given *the Company's intent to promote peace and the adverse reactions that would follow revelations of Chipewyan aggression, it follows then that the information supplied the Company was very likely distorted. The Company's trade was carried on by ship, with only brief stops made at various points along the coast, making it unlikely that the traders would - or could - obtain a significant amount of information from their Inuit customers. Another possible bias perhaps distorting our picture is the possibility that allegations of Inuit attack were used as an excuse when Chipewyan did not bring in enough furs to satisfy the Company traders, or if they failed to bring in specimens of the copper that so interested Knight and his successors at Churchill. The Chipewyan country was relatively deficient in fur bearing animals and the Chipewyan were largely dependent on other groups for fur, while the source of the raw copper was a great distance from their traditional hunting range. Second, Company officials were most likely to record in the daily journal the unusual events, particularly those adversely affecting the trade. If the trade was below the goals established for the particular post, the official in charge had to explain or justify the deficiency to the Governor and Committee in London. It is also perhaps a part of human nature to be interested in war, crime and the bizarre rather than peace or normal social relations, as witness any edition of any North American newspaper. The implication of this is that mutual avoidance was probably the general rule of Chipewyan-Inuit relations, that deliberate raids into hostile territory were probably rare and that peaceful relations were possible between individuals or small groups in localized areas from time to time. A general feeling of hostility and sporadic fighting does not necessarily preclude other types of relations, and there are hints in the records that relatively peaceful relations could and did occur. Some examples may be cited to illustrate this point. In the 1760s Matonabbee visited the mouth of the Coppermine River with his companion I-dot-le-aza and gave gifts to the Inuit whom they encountered there; in 1771 Matonabbee was the reluctant leader of the Chipewyan war party that massacred the Inuit at Bloody Falls, as recorded by Hearne. At the same time that the massacre occurred, however, both Chipewyan and Inuit were peacefully trading with the Company's vessels at their regular trading sites on the coast of the Bay. In the summer of 1747 Swaine (1748,11:266) described several people that he encountered in company with the Inuit at Wager Bay (far beyond what has hitherto been thought of as Chipewyan country) as being "in Complexion and Manner very different from the Eskemaux, although in the same Habits. ..." The only non-Eskimoid people possible in that vicinity were Chipewyan. During the summer of 1742 Captain Middleton explored the coast with two Chipewyan guides, whom he had agreed to put ashore within a few days travel from their</page><page sequence="15">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 147 home country (HBC B.42/a/23, dated June 17, 1742). This proved to be the mainland at Marble Island, in Inuit lands (Middleton 1742:105-106), when the Chipewyan returned to Churchill the following year there was no evidence that they had suffered at the hands of the Inuit (HBC B.42/a/24, May 3, 1743). Still earlier, some Chipewyan had made peace with some Inuit in 1721, as indicated previously in this paper (HBC B .42/a/1, fo. 127 d.) There are other indications in the records that individuals or small groups may have been on peaceful terms, but perhaps more significant are the many years of the early and mid- 18th century when no mention is made of hostility. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that hostility and warfare was not the sole characteristic of Chipewyan-Inuit relations in this early historical period, but the situation was significantly more complex than most authors have recognized. Peaceful Coexistence and Trade Generally peaceful relations had been established at least partly through the direct and indirect influence of the Hudson's Bay Company within about fifty years between the Chipewyan and Cree, although almost a century was required to achieve the same result along the Chipewyan-Inuit interface. Superficially it would appear that the effort made by the Company was the decisive factor, but there were at least three other critically important factors involved. One was the displacement of population brought about by a combination of population decline brought on by the great smallpox epidemic of 1781 and the search for better fur bearing territories. A second factor was the greater profit to be derived from acting as middle men in the fur trade with peoples far distant from the trading posts. Finally, there was the awkwardness created when two or more enemies were trading at the same post, and it was under this circumstance that the Company's efforts were most noticeable. Chipewyan and Cree relations near the coast altered at a relatively early stage. Cree were employed by the Hudson's Bay Company at York Factory as Home Guard Indians, i.e., to hunt and perform other services on behalf of the personnel, particularly in the geese hunting seasons of spring and autumn. When Churchill was established Cree, too, were the basis of the Home Guard establishment but as time went on they were substantially replaced by Chipewyan. In general they came together only at the fort when their arrivals to trade sometimes coincided. Both societies continued to exploit their particular traditional ecotones and only en route to the fort were they likely to meet and hostility would have been extremely awkward for the trading parties that were extremely vulnerable to attack. Thus peace in the coastal region had become a necessity. In'the far hinterland peace had been established between Chipewyan and Cree for reasons that are not altogether clear. Further to the west Cree continued to attack other Athapaskan speakers, although hostilities had ended with those of the Peace River region as noted above. In his travels of 1789, Mackenzie (1927:137) noted that the region north of Lake Athabasca to the south shore of Great Slave Lake had "recently" been conquered by the Cree, displacing the Slave. Some hostility apparently remained, for as late as July 12, 1825 the Cumberland House district report (HBC B.49/e/5) relates that: A War party which assembled with a view of joining the Cree against the Slave tribes. prevented upwards of twenty of my Indians from making any Spring hunt.</page><page sequence="16">148 JAMES G. E. SMITH It has been noted that after the smallpox epidemic of 1781 that the surviving Cree concentrated near the southern part of their formerly vast territory near the Churchill River, the abandoned territory then being utilized by some Chipewyan (Gillespie 1975b: 369-385). While no ethnographic or historical research has been done on the western Cree of the Churchill River and that on the southwestern Chipewyan very limited, there does not appear to have been any significant resurgence of hostility. Cree contact with the Inuit was minimal during the 19th century, for the only place where they could normally encounter was at Fort Churchill. In the 20th century some Cree were employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, Revillon Freres, and perhaps other free traders in bringing supplies to the posts and outposts that were established after World War I and the florescence of the fur trade. According to old informants who had been involved in this activity, friendly relations were established with specific families of Caribou Inuit with whom they stayed on the trips and by whom they were given hospitality. Chipewyan relations with the Inuit during the 19th and early 20th century were of a complex nature. No formal war parties apparently occurred after 1811, but peaceful coexistence did not necessarily mean friendly harmony. With peace, however, new or perhaps more regular intensive trading contacts were possible and did occur. Our sources are limited, for there were no trading posts or reports from the tundra itself until much later. The Chipewyan role as middle man in the fur trade with Athapaskan speakers had ended with the establishment of the inland forts of the trading companies. Their experience, however, must have served as a model for the new developing relationship with the Inuit, especially those in the far hinterland for whom the long overland trek to Churchill was extraordinarily difficult and time consuming. The Company's insistence on peace was doubtless reinforced by the prospects of the great profits to be made in exchanging metal objects such as axes, knives, awls and files for furs and other items; metal tools had a value proportionate to the distance from the trading posts. Trade between Chipewyan and Inuit sometime prior to 1823 is documented by West (1966:183), who wrote: . . . the object of the Esquimaux in meeting with different tribes at Chesterfield Inlet every year is to barter with those principally who trade at Churchill Factory, and also with some Northern [Chipewyan] Indians, who exchange what European articles they have for fish hooks made of bone, and sinew lines and skins [emphasis mine]. As of 1832, George Simpson (1843:71) wrote that some of the Athabasca region Chipewyan accompanied the Churchill Chipewyan to their annual meeting with the Inuit at Yath-kyed Lake. The trade for pelts was apparently great enough for it to have been forbidden by the Company, as indicated in the Churchill post journal of November 8, 1841 (HBC B.42/a/175, fo. 13 d.): The Chipewyans had previously been forbidden to trade with the Esquimaux nevertheless the first party brought 12 white foxes &amp; 9 wolves that we find procured from the Esquiaux and which was not known until they left here. the last party likewise brought 17 white foxes of the same kind and which were traded on the Esquimaux standard, as would be the rest if known in time. however we happen to know the parties and will hereafter make them pay the difference and which is considerable, same time give them a lecture for their roguerry and sly tricks.</page><page sequence="17">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 149 During the 19th century the Chipewyan shifted their hunting area toward the treeline, abandoning the far reaches of the Barrens which were then being occupied by the ancestors of the historic Caribou Inuit. Many additional records of contact and trade between Chipewyan and Inuit on the Barrens extend into the 20th century. Inuit were permitted to travel through Chipewyan lands to the Company post at the northeast bay of Reindeer Lake, Brochet, in 1906 when threatened with starvation (Turquetil 1907:332). In 1914 Buchanan (1920:156-157) reported that a small band of Inuit travelled to Brochet annually, trading arctic fox, bear, wolverine and a few musk ox for trade goods. In 1938 a band of starving Inuit reached Brochet and the Chipewyan gave them permission to camp and hunt on Reindeer Lake where caribou were abundant. Trading on the Barrens was further documented by the Roman Catholic missionaries wanting to meet the Inuit. Father Gaste in 1868, in company with the Chipewyan, encountered them on the Barrens. Interrelations were apparently frequent for Gaste's ( 1960:6-13) party was met with ritual greetings, Chipewyan offering tobacco as gifts and Inuit reciprocating with "musical entertainment" and offered sun dried meat, for they knew "very well that neither I nor my companions would relish the half rotten meats" (ibid.:9). In the early 20th century Father Turquetil also documented the trade that occurred in the Barrens (Turquetil 1904:51; 1907:332; 1912: 183). Still later Birket-Smith (1929:144, 165; 1930:36) wrote that the Chipewyan obtained highly prized Inuit dogs and soapstone for pipe bowls in return for mocassins and snowshoes. Intensely competitive fur trade resulted after World War I and booming fur prices brought new traders to the area. The Honourable Company found itself in intense competition with Revillon Freres and a number of free traders establishing posts and outposts in the northern forest fringe or on the tundra edge (Usher 1971:140-143). Both Chipewyan and Cree were employed by the traders, most frequently to freight supplies to the distant posts from the main centers of Churchill and Brochet. Some were employed as sub-clerk/interpreters at outposts such as Windy Lake or Lake Ennadai, and still others were sometimes used to visit Chipewyan or Inuit camps to-procure furs. Some Chipewyan and Cree gained some knowledge of the Inuit tongue, inuktitut, but no Inuit would lower themselves to learn Chipewyan (Birket-Smith 1929:165; 1930:9). Perhaps it behooves the trader to learn the language of his customers. In the relatively modem period, from about 1920 to about 1958, the data secured from Chipewyan and Cree informants indicates that the Indians engaged on trading missions developed special relations with particular Inuit men and their families that ensured hospitality when travelling through the Barrens. The relationships were apparently enduring, and the pattern adapted to hunting and trapping as well as trading. The partnership established may well have included wife sharing and the extension of kinship to the partners and their families, an interpretation consistent with the trading partnerships that were characteristic of other parts of the Eskimo-Indian interface across North America. On this basis, one may suggest that the pattern extends back into the 19th century, although lacking documentation. To summarize this period, the Hudson's Bay Company's efforts to make peace and to stabilize the fur trade had been successful, albeit by mechanisms over which it had no control, including depopulation and population relocation due to epidemics, and shifting for better fur country, the advantages to be derived from peaceful travel and, especially, the profits to be derived from acting as middle men in the fur trade. Peaceful coexistence</page><page sequence="18">150 JAMES G. E. SMITH and minor trade continued until the mid- 1950s. Then the decline in the size of the caribou herds and their erratic movements brought the resettlement of the Caribou Inuit at Baker Lake and other major settlements, and the Duck Lake band of Chipewyan was resettled in Churchill, along with Cree and Inuit, each in a separate part of the townsite. But the problems of resettlement and the haphazard policies of the Canadian government are beyond the scope of this paper. Summary and Conclusions At the onset of recorded history the limited evidence substantiates the view that a Hobbesian condition of "Warre" existed among the Native peoples in the hinterland west of Hudson Bay. The archaeological evidence (Dumond 1979) does not suggest borrowing or diffusion among these peoples and the genetic features indicate major differences (Szathmary 1979). The earliest historical documents, those referring to the period prior to 1714, lack the details - if they mention international relations at all - that would permit a comprehensive analysis of the entire region. Insofar as they exist, they note that hostility was characteristic between the separate "nations," the latter term referring to people of similar language, culture, history and sense of social identity, and not conveying any sense of political unity. Historical records become relatively abundant after 1714 at York Fort and after 1717 at Churchill, and confirm the general condition of widespread hostility. The Hudson's Bay Company began at this time to influence the Native bands to establish the peace necessary for a profitable fur trade. Peace was established at an early stage between the Chipewyan and Cree bands immediately to the west of the Bay in 1715-16, and between those of the Lake Athabasca region by about 1760. With the interposition of the Chipewyan trading at Churchill, the Cree no longer had a common frontier or easy access. to their traditional enemies, the Inuit. The Chipewyan and Inuit were apt to meet at only a few areas, such as the lower Coppermine River and near the Bay coast, and recorded relations were hostile. The intensity of actual warfare during the early and mid-18th century is questionable, for the inherent bias of the Company's records is that they record reported hostilities but there were many years in which no such events were noted. The records, however, increasingly indicate instances of mutual toleration as the century progressed. By the early 19th century peaceful coexistence or mutual toleration characterized the region. This resulted in part from efforts of the Company, but perhaps more importantly from the indirect consequences of the initiation of the fur trade. The Cree were able to travel unimpeded and without fear of attack to York and Churchill and very probably to carry on a profitable trade as middle men with the Cree and other Algonkian speakers of the western interior. There is no evidence available of Cree being middle men in trade with the Chipewyan or other Athapaskans at any time, although they may have done so as Home Guard Indians, employed by the fur companies at posts established after the late 18th century. The Chipewyan had early established themselves as middle men to the Yellowknives and to the Dogribs (and perhaps to other Athapaskans of the Mackenzie River drainage). With the curtailment of the middle man role following establishment of the interior forts</page><page sequence="19">Chipewyan, Cree and Inuit Relations West of Hudson Bay, 1714-1955 151 in the Athabasca and Mackenzie regions, the Chipewyan were diverted to trade with the Inuit: it was more profitable to trade than to kill. This desirable state of affairs had begun and was widespread at some undetermined period prior to 1823, and continued to post World War I years, when the middle man role was again curtailed by the establishment of trading posts and outposts in the boom period after 1920. Cree and Chipewyan were engaged by the traders to carry freight to these northern posts, to act as sub-clerks or interpreters, and to trade directly with the Inuit at their own camps. According to Cree and Chipewyan informants, they established close personal relations with specific Inuit families as "partners. " Trading partnerships were common between Indians and Eskimo in Alaska (as well as elsewhere), and it is within the realm of possibility that they occurred between Chipewyan and Inuit in the 19th century, if not earlier. The change from generalized hostility and, probably more frequently, mutual avoidance to one of mutual toleration proceded gradually and tenuously, and by means of individuals establishing personal relationships to one another. While .it is beyond the scope of this paper to deal with the contemporary situation, I will only briefly note that between Cree, Chipewyan and Inuit personal relationships tend to be restrained, sometimes tense and often characterized by avoidance. I must also note a further bias in the data considered here. The records primarily contain reports, first or second hand, from the Chipewyan and Cree, rarely from the Inuit. Further, while we have early ethnographic reports on the Indians, it was not until the 20th century that comparable information comes from the Inuit regions. My own ethnographic research has been with Chipewyan and Cree, and my knowledge of Inuit is limited to the literature and the most casual of observations of Inuit in Euro-Canadian settlements. This paper has been concerned with the change from a condition of hostility and occasions of war to one of peaceful coexistence. It may be well to examine, however negative the findings, the possible causes of the original hostility and the tenuousness of the peace. Economic factors may be discounted. Each of the three groups under consideration occupied distinctive econiches and had developed distinctive subsistence strategies that were not competitive. The Cree hunted primarily moose and woodland caribou, the ranges of which would only occasionally overlap with those of the barren-ground caribou hunted by the Chipewyan. The Inuit had a maritime-inland adaptation and only in summer would they rarely encounter near the lower Coppermine River, although it is possible that a similar situation obtained at times at areas near the coast of the Bay. Moreover, the beliefs of the Native peoples did not include recognition of the possibility of overkill or fluctuations of the numbers of the subsistence species. The Chipewyan, for example, believe that the number of caribou is a constant and that those killed are immediately replaced. Scarcity of caribou is attributed to maltreatment of the animals who will avoid the people responsible and the area where the maltreatment occurred. There is other evidence, cited in this paper, that scarcity of game was attributed to witchcraft of the enemy. These hunting peoples live in a personalized universe, in which illness, death, accident and scarcity of game is attributed to personal will or action. In the Subarctic and Arctic the environment and its bounty is frequently uncertain, dangerous accidents occur, sickness is not infrequent and people must inevitably die. Witchcraft among</page><page sequence="20">152 JAMES G. E. SMITH hunting and gathering societies is the common explanation, and among the hunters under consideration it was natural to ascribe the problem to this source. But since these were egalitarian societies with a pronounced emphasis on generosity and sharing, and communal hunts, an internal witch would suffer as much as his victims. Hence, the source of evil is externalized: the witch is to be found among the enemy for the most serious evils such as the death of a leader or the lack of caribou. In addition, the three soceities rarely encountered one another. They shared no common language and chance meetings were fraught with tension. There were no formal political institutions to prevent violence. Death by witchcraft or by homicide was a personal blow to the deceased's kin who were obligated to take vengeance. We may, therefore, see the sporadic outbreak of war as the manifestation of generalized feuds. In a wider sense we are reviewing a strong case of ethnocentrism, in which none of the societies had little need for the goods or services of the others. With the advent of the fur trade there were advantages to coexistence and there was a growing complexity in "international" relations. Finally, to return to the questions raised initially, I note that both Glover (1969:xlv) and Janes (1973:39-54) were in part correct in their interpretations of Chipewyan and Inuit relations. A generlaized state of hostility did exist between them at time of first significant European contact, although it probably did not preclude at times and places occasional peaceful relations. With the advent of the Hudson's Bay Company in the area after 1714, changes began to occur that made relationships more complex. The Company exerted its influence to make peace, but perhaps much more importantly the Chipewyan began to gradually find that it was more expedient and profitable to trade with the Inuit of the distant hinterland than to fight with them. The emergent period of peaceful coexistence was complicated by the traditions of enmity, feud and witchcraft sometimes compounded by resentment over differential treatment by the Company, as in the case of the Knapp's Bay massacre. With population displacements resulting from the fur trade and generally peaceful relations, open warfare or raiding ceased, but interpersonal relationships were limited and genuinely amicable only between men who established partnerships: avoidance and restraint were more characteristic. Between Cree and Chipewyan initial historical relations were hostile, although it is possible that hostility was intensified when the Cree obtained muskets and metal weapons and tools that gave them, perhaps, marginal superiority over the Chipewyan. Raids against the Chipewyan had little economic basis other than the capture of women and children who were enslaved; perhaps more important was the prestige that came from successful combat. In still another sense, the history of intersocietal relations west of Hudson Bay is a study of autonomous small nations unwittingly in the process of becoming ethnic groups within the context of the Canadian state structure.

I am also indebted to my colleagues, E. S. Burch, Jr., Beryl C. Gillespie and Dale Russell, for many informative conversations and correspondence. The views expressed here are my own, of course, although they reflect the influence of my colleagues. 1. Bishop and Ray purport to provide a model chronology for the Central Subarctic. It seems clear that while the model may apply for much of the southern Subarctic, it is of limited value in the more northerly areas away from the major trade routes or with poor communication and transport. 2. The term cipewayanuk is variously taken to refer to Eskimo-like parkas or to the method by which beaver pelts were prepared and stretched. Neither explanation seems acceptable, for no contemporary Chipewyan have ever heard of parkas other than those made by Inuit, nor are there representations by Europeans of this type of parka. The Chipewyan were taught by the Hudson's Bay Company personnel to prepare the pelts of fur bearers, so this explanation seems unlikely. REFERENCES Birket-Smith, Kaj 1929 The Caribou Eskimo.
