<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— I: Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization:  Letters of a Traveler  Figure 2 The situation of the post station (at Kazbek) has no beauty except when the great mountain  is unveiled. Then the picture seen from the windows will not easily be forgotten. Again and  again, it has been painted and photographed; it is met with in every book of travel, even  in the shop windows of St. Petersburg. It is the keepsake view—the Jungfrau from Inter- laken—of the Caucasus. (Freshfield 1896, 87) The Dariel pass through the Caucasus today, as in the nineteenth  century, provides the main viable route between Russia and Georgia, the  Georgian military road. The journey from Vladikavkaz in modern North  Ossetia into Georgia follows the Terek River, which flows north from  Mount Kazbek (Georgian Qaz[i]begi, also Mqinvari “glacier”) into Rus- sia, while the southern flanks of the route follow the Aragvi River, flow- ing south toward Tbilisi (see map 1). This journey from Vladikavkaz to  Tbilisi and vice versa is across some very well-traveled literary terrain for  European, Russian, and Georgian Romantics (see for example Greenleaf  1991, 1994; Layton 1994, Ram and Shatirishvili 2004, Manning 2008),  whose overlapping narratives in genres from fairy tale to travel account,  — 28 — </page> <page sequence="2"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  lyric verse to adventure tale, gave the landscape a peculiar ambivalence  where fact and fancy were intertwined, so much so that the Dariel gorge  itself has sometimes been called “a fairy tale in twelve versts” (Graham  1911, 164). It is in this rugged and well-traversed piece of literary and  geographical terrain that the noted Georgian writer Ilia Chavchavadze  (1837–1907) positioned his travelogue-cum-literary manifesto, Letters  of a Traveler (Mgzavris Cerilebi [composition begun in 1861, first pub- lished in 1871, and again in a fuller uncensored version in 1892]).1  Chavchavadze’s Letters of a Traveler is perhaps the single most impor- tant piece of political writing of the Georgian generation of the 1860s,  who called themselves Terg-daleulebi (“those who have drunk from the  Terek River”). This term has potentially ambiguous reference in this text,  denoting at once a member of the Russian-educated Georgian gentry  intelligentsia represented by the narrator, who is Terg-daleuli because he  has crossed (“drunk from”) the Terek, the boundary between Russia and  Georgia, in search of enlightenment, as well as denoting a member of  the Georgian people, Lelt Ghunia, who as a Moxevian peasant, dwells  beside the Terek River in Xevi, and could therefore implicitly be taken as  a true Terg-daleuli.2 The term Terg-daleuli itself undergoes a transforma- tion and revalorization in the course of the text from the first sense to  the second, as Chavchavadze becomes disenchanted with the promises  of Russian civilization and discovers authentic culture instead among  the Georgian folk. This transition is mirrored in the natural order in the  changes in the character of the Terek River itself from the placid, servile  Terek in the Russian plains at Vladikavkaz to the torrential, free Terek in  the Caucasus mountains. In this chapter, I am primarily interested in exploring the rhetorical  opposition between form and content of Lelt Ghunia’s speech, whose cor- rect realistic representation Chavchavadze presents, in his coda, as being  the only project of the text. I argue that Chavchavadze uses this opposi- tion both to naturalize his own relationship to the peasant Lelt Ghunia  as a member of the “intelligentsia” to the “people,” creating an organic  unity of language, a nation. At the same time, the lack of relationship  between form and content in the disjointed dialogue of a drunken Rus- sian officer he meets along the way has the opposite effect, emphasizing  the immense gap between the pretenses of Russian civilization (form)  and its actual effects in the lives of the Georgian people (content). In this  manner, as the partner in two very different dialogues, Chavchavadze  — 29 — </page> <page sequence="3"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— implicitly inserts himself between the Russian colonizing state and the  colonized Georgian people as a mediating figure, as a Terg-daleuli in both  the above senses, educated in Russia, Chavchavadze yet remains a Geor- gian, able to speak both languages and thus to bridge the gap between  Russian civilization and Georgian folk culture.  It may seem odd that a Georgian movement for political and cultural  reform would take its name (Terg-daleuli) from a river in the Caucasus  mountains on the very border of Georgia (the Terek, Georgian Tergi),  but here too Chavchavadze was locating himself in relation to an exist- ing “geopoetic” tradition in which the political order was construed in  terms of the natural order. In their discussion of the poetry of an earlier  generation of Georgian Romanticism, Ram and Shatirishvili (2004) ar- gue that Georgian gentry poets of an earlier generation used different  “geopoetic” strategies to reduce the triadic opposition between Russia,  Georgia, and the Caucasus into a dualist opposition expressive of their  newfound and ambivalent position as a relatively privileged colonial  class under Russian rule. A central tendency of such “geopoetics” is to  elide the opposition between Russia and Georgia over and against the  warlike and uncivilized tribes of the Caucasus (on which imaginings, see  Layton 1997). In the text examined here however, Ilia Chavchavadze  creates a defiant prose manifesto aimed at this earlier generation’s  geopoetics and geopolitics and proposes a new geopoetic strategy, elid- ing the opposition between Georgia and the Caucasus over and against  Russian domination.3 He does so first of all by appropriating the well- known image of the Terek River as a multivalent symbol of Caucasian  freedom and savagery (Layton 1994), translating its untamed roar into  a human voice expressing the woes of his motherland (thereby identify- ing the Caucasus with Georgia). Second, moving from nature to culture,  he finds his exemplary Georgian speaker from among the territorially  most marginal speakers of Georgian, the Moxevians, who dwell by the  Terek in the Caucasus between Russia and Georgia. It is in their appro- priated voice and dialect that the political ideology of Terg-daleuli gentry  nationalism is delivered by proxy. Terg-daleuli mountaineer dialect para- doxically becomes the vehicle for Terg-daleuli gentry ideology.  In this respect, the text to be discussed here represents a radical change  in the role of language and especially folk language as having an increas- ingly constitutive role in the imagining of larger social totalities, such as  “nations” and “peoples,” a change experienced both in Georgia and more  — 30 — </page> <page sequence="4"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  generally throughout Europe in the nineteenth century. In this century,  language increasingly came to be seen as a uniquely natural sign of social  membership; hence a common linguistic heritage—however dialectically  stratified—could suture together enlightened society and the unenlight- ened people. In contrast to older elites, in Georgia as elsewhere, these  new elites increasingly resorted to language-based forms of legitimacy of  social projects, seeing in these a kind of “authority of authenticity” (Gal  and Woolard 2001). Like the texts of an earlier generation of Georgian  Romantics (Ram and Shatirishvili 2004), this text places Georgia and the  elites who spoke for it in a “geopoetic” context in which the crucial terms  to which it is to be related are the Caucasus and Russia. Giving his read- ing of the aesthetics of this literary landscape, Chavchavadze engages his  Romantic literary forebears in an explicitly political dialogue and offers  a radical revision of the imaginative geography that separates Georgia  from the Caucasus. Unlike these texts, however, in which intertextual  relations are primarily with Russian antecedents, Ilia Chavchavadze en- gages both Georgian and Russian literary antecedents, as well as the  voice of the “people” of whose voice Chavchavadze is the mere tran- scriber. Whereas travel accounts through the Caucasus by Romantics,  Georgian and otherwise, represent it as a moving, but silent, landscape,  Chavchavadze populates this landscape, positing a close, almost organic  connection between the voice of nature in the form of the Terek River  and the voice of the people in the form of Lelt Ghunia, a peasant dwelling  by the Terek, thus at once humanizing the indigenous natural order (the  Terek) and naturalizing the human order (Lelt Ghunia).  Author, Text, Context  Before addressing the main issue of this chapter—language as the ba- sis for a national protest against Russian imperial civilization—a brief  introduction of Ilia Chavchavadze, perhaps the most prominent and  significant member of the generation of the 1860s, the Terg-dauleulebi,  in Georgia, is in order. His multiple activities as writer, publicist, editor,  and cultural reformer were instrumental in the development of Geor- gian print culture and the formulation of the ideological position of what  may be called “gentry nationalism” (the term is Suny’s [1988, 133–134])  in the late nineteenth century. His assassination in 1907 by parties  unknown provided this group with a martyr, bringing this somewhat  — 31 — </page> <page sequence="5"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— marginal nationalist ideology into closer alignment with more popular  movements for social justice, thus helping to transform and combine  the social and national movements in Georgia in the wake of the dis- appointment of failure of the “social movement” in Georgia during the  1905 revolution.4 Known to Georgians simply as “Ilia,” Chavchavadze  was made an Orthodox saint in the last years of Soviet power, and to this  day he remains the central authoritative figure for Georgian nationalism.  Chavchavadze was also a key figure in articulating the relations between  older nobility and the emergent intelligentsia in Georgia, for he belonged  to both classes. A noble by birth, he attended university in the Faculty of  Law in St. Petersburg from 1857 to 1861 and returned a member of the  nascent Georgian intelligentsia, that is, as a true terg-daleuli, in the sense  of one who crossed the Terek (the boundary of Russia and Georgia) to  receive an education (on this sense of the term, see Suny 1988). Writing  at a time when a Georgian print culture and a class of intelligentsia were  emerging from the manuscript culture and court sociability of the nobil- ity, he straddled both spheres as noble and writer of poetic manuscripts  and printed prose. He engaged in debates with representatives of the  older generation of the nobility like Grigol Orbeliani (1804–1883) on the  proper form of literary Georgian, arguing for a style closer to that of the  spoken norms of the folk (see below, chapter 4). Typical of the changes  and contradictions of the period, these debates concerning the modern- ization and popularization of a Georgian print language and print culture  were conducted in a typically classical and aristocratic form—a series  of traditional exchanges of poetry in traditional meters, disseminated  “domestically” by mouth or manuscript among members of the Georgian  urban gentry, and only later publicized in print. The text, Letters of a  Traveler, shares many of these ambiguities, since it circulated in various  manuscript forms through aristocratic urban networks, encountering a  face-to-face public over a period of ten years; it was eventually published  for a potentially popular readership of anonymous contemporaries in  full, uncensored and authoritative form thirty years later in 1892.  The text also witnesses other transformations as the Georgian ar- istocracy transformed itself into a Georgian intelligentsia. Just as the  generation-defining poetic debate on literary style between Orbeliani  and Chavchavadze revolved around the choice between an adherence to  classicism (Orbeliani) and the need for a language that was popular, folk  (Chavchavadze), so too we see in this text the first systematic attention  — 32 — </page> <page sequence="6"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  to the description of a folk dialect in Georgian, the first application of  the narodnik principles that were in the air in Russia (Chavchavadze had  met the well-known Russian reformer Chernyshevsky in Russia) and  now were applied to Georgia (with an extremely heavy admixture of  apologetics for the preexisting feudal order, it should be noted, hence  “gentry nationalism”). More generally, it was the first Georgian evi- dence of the trans-European turn to popular language-based forms of  legitimation for elites. This turn to the people or folk (xalxi), of course,  occurs on the eve of the Emancipation of the serfs in Georgia, and a  transformation in the role of the Georgian nobility. Originally a rural  agrarian estate depending on the serfs, the Georgian elite would be- come urban-educated class of bureaucrats, court officials, writers, and  nascent intelligenty who in different ways would constitute themselves  rhetorically as being in the service of “the people,” in whose voice, and  therefore, in whose language, they spoke. As a result, in this text, more  than in any other of the period, the question of linguistic form takes on  immediately political content. Synopsis of the Text  Chavchavadze’s Letters of a Traveler is a fairly short text divided into  eight passages, narrating his journey from Vladikavkaz in modern- day Ossetia into Georgia across the Dariel pass. In the first section (I),  which was heavily censored in the first printing of 1871, we encounter  Chavchavadze in Vladikavkaz, taking leave of his traveling companion, a  Frenchman. This authentic representative of Europe appears seemingly  only to marvel at the backwardness of the Russian (postal) transporta- tion system before he goes on his way. With a sideward glance at Russian  artists’ idealization of their own folk (“The reality is twice as repulsive  as their pictures are beautiful”), he gives us an unflattering and detailed  description of a Russian post cart driver (yamshchik), who is presented as  being coarse, ugly, and stupid. In the second passage (II), Chavchavadze leaves Vladikavkaz, and from  this point the Terek River becomes his constant traveling companion. As  he crosses a bridge over the Terek, he notes that it no longer resembles  the madly rushing, “heroic-demonic Terek” found in the Caucasus and  celebrated by Orbeliani, whose poem “Saghamo Gamosalmebisa” (“Night  of Farewell” [1959 (1841), 58–9]) he cites twice in this passage. In the  — 33 — </page> <page sequence="7"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— first of a series of allegorical meditations on the Terek, Chavchavadze  identifies this change in the nature of the Terek from mountains to plains  explicitly with both with the passivity of the Russian peasantry and co- optation of the Georgian gentry under Russian rule: “That destructive  Terek! How two-faced it has been! See how deathly it is. Whenever it  turns its back to us and its face to Russia, when it gets into the plains and  the flat country, somehow that demonic, heroic voice ceases. . . . There it  is as placid, as silent, as if it dwelt under the rod or had received a high  official post.” At the end of the section, he has reached the post station  at Lars, where he reflects on the value of his four years of education in  Petersburg, from which he is returning.  In the third section (III), Chavchavadze’s random and confused reflec- tions on what he has seen, suffered, and learned at home and abroad un- dergo what he describes as a “revolution,” and he wonders whether these  same four years away from his native land will make him a stranger to  his land, unable to speak or understand its language and its complaints.  His reverie is interrupted by a drunken Russian officer, who engages  him in an unintentional mockery of enlightened discourse, first as an  equal based on the fact that Chavchavadze is an emissary from civiliza- tion (Petersburg), and then when he finds that Chavchavadze is actually  a Georgian, as a subaltern Oriental “local” in need of enlightenment. In  the deranged conversation that ensues, Russia’s pretenses to a civiliz- ing mission are further deflated, as the drunken officer proves unable  to define the terminology of civilization except in the most vulgar and  debased terms.  The next two sections (IV–V) occur at the post station of Stepants- minda (also known as Kazbek), the first Georgian village along the  route. Chavchavadze polemically engages with Orbeliani once more (IV)  at sunset at Kazbek post station, citing another of Orbeliani’s poems  (Sadghegrdzelo “Toast” (1959 [1827–1870]), and covertly alluding to the  description of nature contained in Orbeliani’s “Night of Farewell,” which  takes place at the same spot. Here Chavchavadze makes another series of  polemical, allegorical ruminations, this time on the opposition between  Mount Kazbek and the rushing Terek River at its feet; he repudiates the  gleaming inaccessibility of the mountain for the muddy raging torrents  of the Terek, the former identified with idealism, death, and stasis, the  latter identified with materialism, life, and above all, motion and circula- tion. At nightfall in section V, Chavchavadze has an epiphany with the  — 34 — </page> <page sequence="8"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  Terek River at its center—an epiphany which causes him to understand  and identify with its voice. Here again, he allegorizes the silence and  darkness of night as ignorance and lack of enlightenment, while the “un- silenced complaint” of the Terek in the darkness embodies human life  awakened to the promise of a new day.  Departing Kazbek at dawn the next day, Ilia then has two conver- sations with Lelt Ghunia (VI–VII), who as a local mountaineer “Terek- drinker” peasant stands both in physical and mental counterpoint to  the Russian post cart driver at Vladikavkaz: “In the end it appeared that  he was an interested observer of that little land which fate had outlined  around him and which she had appointed to vary his colorless life” (VI).  Lelt Ghunia further clarifies the destruction actually wrought by Russian  colonization in counterpoint to its putative civilizing mission presented  in the dialogue at Lars (III), particularly dwelling on the corrosive effects  of Russian rule on the (allegedly) once harmonious relations within and  between estates. He concludes, This I want you to understand, that formerly if we gave  our lives in service there were rewards, there were great  gifts; we found our livelihood in glory and in bravery, a  man did not live in vain. Now we find our livelihood in  lying, immorality, breaking oaths, and in betraying one  another. (VII)  Lastly, in the coda of the text (VIII), Chavchavadze explains that his  sole purpose has been to dutifully record the ethnographic text found in  the two preceding sections realistically. That is, his focus has been only  on realistic verisimilitude to the form and not the factual veracity of  Ghunia’s speech: Whether my Moxevian spoke the truth or not I will not  now inquire. And what business is it of mine? I merely  mention in passing what I as a traveler heard from him.  My one endeavor in this has been to give to his thoughts  their own form and to his words his accent. If I have suc- ceeded in this I have fulfilled my intention. (VIII) For the remainder of this chapter, I will use roman numeral section  — 35 — </page> <page sequence="9"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— headings (I–VIII) uniquely to identify passages from Ilia’s text, whose  relative location in the Dariel pass is indicated on the map (see map). The Voice of the Intelligentsia and the Voice of the People  Chavchavadze presents Letters of a Traveler as a simple exercise in represen- tational “realism,” an absolutely neutral transcription of an ethnographic  and linguistic reality, characteristic of the generation of the 1860s. Part  of the central importance of the text then, is that it represents an impor- tant first systematic attempt at the faithful description of the dialect and  political institutions of the Georgian “people.”5 This serious attention to  correct representation of dialect form and ethnographic content is surely  motivated by a new literary taste for “realism” (Paperno 1988). However,  Chavchavadze’s realism was strongly influenced by Russian understand- ings of realism as a kind of “civic aesthetics” (affirming the social role of  literature) exemplified by writers like Chernyshevsky and shows a similar  appreciation of the critical potential afforded by the aesthetic (Paperno  1988, 7). Also, like Chernyshevsky’s realism, Chavchavadze’s realism  (like most other Russian and Georgian writers in the period) is a “social  realism,” an aesthetic of realism strongly tied to the “social question,” de- scribing the abject condition of the peasants in the Emancipation period  (Frierson 1993). As with Russian social realism, the apparently neutral  aesthetic perspective of realistic description becomes a rhetorical device  allowing Chavchavadze to covertly critique the Russian colonial state,  the obscurantism of whose civilizing pretenses is represented by a sys- tematic failure of the forms of words to match their content. At the same  time, while the form of Lelt Ghunia’s transcribed conversation is humble  terg-daleuli (Moxevian) dialect, the content of Lelt Ghunia’s conversation  is in effect the political program of the terg-daleuli intelligentsia. Hence,  the opposition between form and content thematically central to the text  becomes an organizing rhetorical opposition.  Presenting his work as an anonymous traveler’s simple act of tran- scription of the voice of Lelt Ghunia, Chavchavadze makes his text pivot  around this central identification—an elision which creates the “author- ity of authenticity” (Gal and Woolard 2001, 7) by which Chavchavadze  identifies his own voice with the authentic voice of the terg-daleuli peas- ant, Lelt Ghunia. The text was composed in the 1860s (from 1861 to  1871) at the same time as the term intelligentsia was beginning to be  — 36 — </page> <page sequence="10"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  used in Russian (and Georgian) society (Confino 1972, 117, Burbank  1996, 97). Not surprisingly, then, it replicates all the ambiguities  which characterized the position of the imperial intelligentsia during  the Great Reforms of the 1860s. This relation is made more complex,  moreover, by Chavchavadze’s position as a member of a colonized intel- ligentsia whose position reflects the peculiarities of the specificities of  Georgian gentry intelligentsia under Russian colonialism.6 As an intel- ligentsia manifesto, the text replicates the very “gulf between society  and the people” that it seeks to mediate—that between a small educated  reading public, mostly composed of gentry (the Georgian term sazoga- doeba can mean aristocratic “society” or intelligentsia “public,” compare  Russian obshchestvo) and an often illiterate people, mostly composed  of peasantry (Georgian xalxi, Russian narod) (Brooks 1978, 98, Todd  1986, 15ff; Gleason 1991, Frierson 1993). This “society” of the “fathers”  gave birth to a (still mostly gentry) “intelligentsia” of the “sons” in the  1860s in fierce intergenerational debates that characterized “the reality  of intelligentsia culture—an ongoing, hence self-contested, and self- refining culture based on personal and public statements about politics”  (Burbank 1996, 107). As this intelligentsia culture was founded on op- position to autocracy and a notion of service to the “people,” however  imagined (Confino 1972, Gleason 1991, 20–1, Burbank 1996), so this  text also opposes the discourses of the Russian colonizing state to those  of the colonized Georgian people, using the ethnographic descriptions  of the defunct political institutions of Georgian folk culture to critique  the civilizing pretenses of the Russian state.  The dialogism of the text replicates all these well-known antinomies.  In fact, the peculiarity of the text is the distinct form of the intertex- tual and intratextual strategies (Jenny 1976, 260; Bauman 2004) that  Chavchavadze uses to mediate them, as well as the distinct strategic  functions of these forms. An intertextual dialogue involving both overt  citation and covert structural imitation or prior Russian and Georgian  Romantic texts addresses the text to a purely literary public of Georgian  intelligentsia. Rather than address these forebears directly, he addresses  them indirectly through his own aesthetic discussion of the “already spo- ken about” landscape, largely through a radical rereading of the “voice”  of the Terek River itself.  His radical rereadings of the natural landscape produces a literary  filiation (Hubbard 1998), which locates this text within a retroactively  — 37 — </page> <page sequence="11"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— imagined “intelligentsia tradition” (Confino 1972, Burbank 1996),  thus performatively creating a literary genealogy for the text. Because  Chavchavadze is a member of a colonial intelligentsia, this literary kin- ship is reckoned bilaterally, with both Russian and Georgian Romantic  antecedents. At the same time, the text reports an actual dialogue with  the actually existing folk who are not, it should be remembered, part of  the audience of the text. The “people” are not yet a “public” (Gleason  1991).7 Juxtaposition of the differing dialects of intelligentsia and folk  in dialogue reveals the essential linguistic relatedness of intelligentsia  and folk, their fraternal membership in a speech (if not literary) com- munity of “Georgians.” If the intertextual relationship creates vertical,  generational, intertextual kinship of “fathers” and “sons” within Geor- gian gentry “society,” the textual dialogic relationship creates horizontal  linguistic kinship between educated Georgians and uneducated moun- taineers as “brothers” (VII). This dialogue of intelligentsia and people is  paired with and opposed to the dialogue with the drunken officer, who  represents the Russian state and Russian civilization, and who claims to  be a writer, an emissary from the world of Russian letters, and a notable  inventor—in other words, an agent of civilizational progress. While the  dialogue with the Georgian people associates high concepts of authentic  Georgian traditions with the low forms of folk dialect, this dialogue in- stead reveals Russian civilization to be a farcical rendition of its European  model, high concepts that are glossed with vulgar referents.  In all these dialogues, Chavchavadze’s mediating position as intel- ligent is constructed as the almost invisible authorizing viewpoint that  unites these dialogues into a single text, just as an intelligent is “entitled  to speak for the good of the social whole” (Burbank 1996, 101). Serving  both as a letter of introduction and a challenge to Georgian “society,” it at  once reproduces the pragmatic presuppositions of that discourse even as  it seeks to transform them. All of these dialogues, in other words, build  up a complex whole, an authorizing intelligentsia mythology, in which  Chavchavadze underwrites his ability as intelligent to “speak for the  people against the state” to an audience of other Georgian intelligenty.  The dialogue with Georgian Romanticism, in particular the figure of  Grigol Orbeliani (1804–1883), a noted Georgian Romantic poet, noble  and high-ranking tsarist official of the previous generation, is mostly  overt. Chavchavadze achieves it through a series of pointed citations  and barbed comments, but also by adopting the time and location (eve- — 38 — </page> <page sequence="12"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  ning at Mount Kazbek) of Orbeliani’s “Night of Farewell” for a series  of allegorical ruminations on nature that occupy Chavchavadze in the  middle of his text (IV–V). The intertextual dialogue with Russian Ro- manticism is by and large achieved covertly, by means of formal imita- tion.8 Chavchavadze’s title and genre recalls a much earlier account of  the same journey by the Russian Romantic Aleksander Griboyedov  (1795–1829), whose own “Travel Notes” about the same journey was  composed in 1818 as a set of jottings and travel notes not intended for  publication, but finally was published only a few years before in 1859,  making it oddly contemporary (though whether the parallelisms be- tween the texts reflect Chavchavadze’s awareness of this text, or simply  reflect the way the journey itself is divided into stages punctuated by  postal stations, cannot be determined conclusively). Whereas Griboye- dov, like many after him, is writing a private travel account of a journey  from home into a strange, foreign land, Chavchavadze inverts the ex- pectations produced by the title and genre, casting himself in the ironic  role of an estranged “traveler” seeking to rediscover his homeland. This  work is divided into eight separate “passages,” and thus Chavchavadze’s  later travelogue formally echoes the structure of Griboyedov’s work. He  also disposes the passages of his journey (roman numerals I–VIII on Fig- ure 3) spatially as a skewed icon of the passages of Griboyedov’s journey  (arabic numbers 1–8 on Figure 3). I note in passing that the divisions of  each text reflect the “stages” of a journey. The literary filiation with Griboyedov, a contemporary of Pushkin,  places Chavchavadze in a covert genealogy with Russian Romanticism,  just as his overt citation of Orbeliani places him in a genealogical re- lation to Georgian Romanticism. But more significantly, Griboyedov  himself married Nino Chavchavadze (a distant relation of Ilia Chavcha- vadze), daughter of the Georgian noble and Romantic poet Aleksan- dre Chavchavadze. In the small circle of Georgian gentry who made  up Georgian “society,” literary relations and kinship relations were  inseparable; if Orbeliani was addressed overtly as Chavchavadze’s con- sanguineal literary kin, then Griboyedov could be reckoned covertly as  his literary kin by marriage. By means of these intertextual allusions,  Chavchavadze constructs a literary filiation as a “son” to two groups of  wayward Romantic “fathers”—Georgian (Orbeliani) and Russian (Gri- boyedov). The dialogue with Russian and Georgian Romantics is done  primarily through intertextuality of the landscape itself, an aestheti- — 39 — </page> <page sequence="13"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— cized landscape which more than any other was fraught with the po- litical categories of colonial imaginative geography that Chavchavadze  wishes to engage and revise.

Nature,  then, assumes for Georgian discourse in this period a fundamentally  political role. In an essentially “totemic” moment (Levi-Strauss 1963),  expressive categories of aestheticized nature were mobilized as an Ae- sopian discourse of “talking politics.” Perhaps this “Aesopian discourse,”  used in a tsarist literary context for veiled speech in the presence of  the censor, was even more Aesopian than the ordinary Russian Aeso- pianism, for just as Aesop used tales of animals to speak in veiled terms  of human society and politics, here the expressive categories of sublime  nature, gloomy mountains, and raging rivers, are used totemically to  produce an Aesopian language for political engagement with the in- herited political-social-spatial imaginary of Romanticism. Russian and  Georgian Romantics had ensured that aesthetics of the landscape, liter- ary appropriations of nature, would be the point of departure for all  further discourse about Georgia and the Caucasus. And nowhere was  this imaginary found in such a concentrated and oft-described form as  the passage to Georgia across the Dariel in the Caucasus, which was fre- quently compared to crossing of the Alps into Italy for the Grand Tour  (Freshfield 1896, 87; on the Grand Tour which is the European object of  comparison for the Dariel Crossing, see Chard 1999).  The crossing of watersheds is a transition from the uncivilized Cau- casus to civilized, but Oriental, Georgia. In Russian Romantic Oriental- ist discourse, these two locales exhibit very different forms of alterity  and suggesting very different colonial projects. As Layton (1992, 1994)  argues, Georgia, though “civilized” and “Christian” was constructed  by Russian Orientalism as a languid Oriental female, indeed, Georgia  forms a classical Oriental counterpart to European Russia.9 By contrast,  the Caucasus was the exemplary locus of masculinity, full of masculine  tribesmen to be fought and emulated, and not a few lovely mountaineer  maids widely rumored “to be very well disposed toward travelers” (Push- kin [1835], 139; more generally see Layton 1994, 1997).  The two places, the Caucasus and Georgia are also opposed by being  associated very different aesthetic categories, the masculine aesthetics  — 41 — </page> <page sequence="15"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— of the sublime and the feminine aesthetics of the beautiful. Russian  Romanticism adopted and adapted the European aesthetic opposition  between the sublime and the beautiful as part of an imperial geopoetic  strategy to appropriate these regions and realize their own coevality  with Europeans (Layton 1994, Ram 2003). In Pan-European aesthetic  discourse, the qualities diagnostic of the sublime, emphasizing gran- deur, vastness, “wild, barren, savage and ‘frowning’ landscapes” are op- posed to the qualities of beauty emphasizing “cultivated, fertile, gentle,  and ‘smiling’ landscapes” (Chard 1999, 110). These aestheticized and  expressive spatial qualities are in turn aligned with gendered qualities  of person, “the sublime with the masculine and the beautiful with the  feminine” (Chard 1999, 117–18). Thus, Russian Romantics like Push- kin and Griboyedov saw the masculine sublime primarily in the gloomy  crags and defiles of the Caucasus Mountains (home of fierce, warlike  people like the Chechens), opposed to the feminized, Orientalized aes- thetics of the beautiful that typified the Georgian plains (Layton 1992).  Georgian Romantics, in turn, adopted the Russian aesthetics of the  sublime and the beautiful to establish their own coevality with their Rus- sian peers in the appropriation of this same terrain (Ram and Shatirishvili  2004, Manning 2008). With the generation of the 1860s, Chavchavadze  in turn adopts this same aestheticized discourse of nature to create an  Aesopian political engagement with both these groups of forebears, but  radically revises and reverses the aesthetics of the landscape. By elimi- nating the opposition between “beautiful” feminine Georgia and the  “sublime” masculine Caucasus, he erases this distinction and identifies  Georgia with the masculine sublime by laying claim to the roar of the  Terek and the landscape of Dariel, paving the way for a Georgian ethno- graphic and literary “turn to the mountains” in the 1880s (on which, see  Le Galcher Baron 1993, Manning 2007, 2008). Domesticating the Voice of the Terek  If earlier Georgian Romantics exulted over the natural beauty of the  Caucasus, it was as often as not a nature alien to humanity and devoid  of human voices. For example, Aleksandre Chavchavadze (1786–1846),  whose poem “The Caucasus” (published in 1852), while strongly indebted  to Russian Romantic antecedents (see Ram and Shatirishvili 2004 for an  extended treatment), nevertheless differs from them pointedly in factor- — 42 — </page> <page sequence="16"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  ing out all references to the human order often found in Russian render- ings of the same landscape (the same tendency is true of Chavchavadze’s  proximal interlocutor, Grigol Orbeliani): Absent in Ch’avch’avadze are any references to the hu- man inhabitants of the Northern Caucasus: we find  deer and goats, but none of the evocations of fierce  Circassians and Chechens that abound in the poems of  Zhukovskii, Pushkin, and Lermontov. In the absence of  ethnographic detail the Caucasus appears through most  of Ch’avch’avadze’s poem as a hypostasis of nature, both  a part of the created world and the theurgic force behind  its creation. Whether apocalyptic or occasionally pas- toral, the Caucasus are decidedly not human. (Ram and  Shatirishvili 2004, 11) It is very much as if Georgian Romantics had fully internalized Rus- sian Romanticism’s aesthetic appreciation for the landscape, but some- how balked at finding anything similar to appreciate in the people living  there.  Ilia Chavchavadze, in a sense reversing this tendency of earlier Geor- gian (but not Russian) Romanticism, humanizes this natural order (giv- ing a human voice to the roar of the Terek) as a prologue to naturalizing  the human order (by naturalizing the human voice of the Terek-dwelling  peasant, Lelt Ghunia). In so doing, Chavchavadze radically revises the  geopoetics characteristic of these earlier Romantics, which as often as  not sought to align Georgia with Russia against the Caucasus, by creating  a novel geopoetics in which the Caucasus, in the form of the Terek River,  is identified with Georgia as opposed to Russia. In Griboyedov’s text,  the frightening animal roar of the Terek in the first five passages marks  the terrain as being the uncivilized, dangerous, frightening Caucasus, a  land of war, strife, and uncivilized mountaineer tribes and bandits (see  in general, Layton 1994). The sixth passage marks the passage from the  uncivilized and frightening Caucasus symbolized by the roar of the Terek  to the pleasant and peaceful Georgia, symbolized by the Aragvi River,  “the morning song of the Georgians.”10 Chavchavadze radically revises this imaginative geography by dis- pensing with the Aragvi (which flows from these mountains into the  — 43 — </page> <page sequence="17"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— plains of Georgia) as a symbol of beautiful Georgia as opposed to the  sublime Caucasus symbolized by the Terek. The Terek can now stand  alone as a symbol of the Georgian Caucasus (the Xevi district beside the  mouth waters of the Terek). By eliminating the ever-present inherited  opposition between the Aragvi and the Terek—between the peaceful,  feminine, civilized, and subdued Georgia and the warlike, masculine and  free Caucasus—he brings Georgia into the Caucasus.11 Chavchavadze also proposes a radical rereading of the meaning of the  roar of the Terek that figures in the texts of Orbeliani, Griboyedov, and  others. The furious animal roar of the unbridled torrents of the Terek  in the Caucasus is a long-standing Romantic symbol of mountaineer  masculinity and freedom. The novelty of Chavchavadze’s reading lies in  how he appropriates the rebellious freedom of the Terek as part of the  Georgian national tradition, representing an authentic Georgian culture  which can be favorably compared to the pretended civilization of Russian  rule, represented by the subdued flow of the Terek in the plains of Russia:  “Happy Terek! You are at your best when you are restless. Stand still but  a little while and do you not turn into a stinking pool and does not this  fearsome roar of yours change to the croaking of frogs!” (IV)  The Terek is identified with freedom of motion and change, but not  necessarily modernity or progress, for Chavchavadze’s program cannot  easily be understood as a progressive one. Rather, it is a somewhat jar- ringly eclectic combination: a celebration of mountaineer freedom and  apologetic for the harmonious and mutually beneficial relations between  estates that once—it is claimed—characterized Georgian feudalism.  The motion and roar of the Terek in the mountains represents politi- cal self-determination and freedom of the (now defunct) autonomous  community-based institutions of the mountaineer polity (eroba, what  is more usually called the temoba by indigenous Moxevian writers like  Aleksandre Qazbegi [1880, 164, 2]). But at the same time as he mourns  the demise of the eroba, Lelt Ghunia extols the recognition of recipro- cal obligations of service and reward and general harmonious relations  between estates that once apparently existed between Georgian peas- ants and nobles. All this was lost, according to Lelt Ghunia, under the  “empty peace” of the Pax Russica, which places the people economically  at the mercy of usurious Armenian merchants and abrogates the system  of reciprocal service and rewards between estates that once apparently  made the Georgian people valorous. This changed social state of affairs,  — 44 — </page> <page sequence="18"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  brought by the subjection of the Georgian people to Russian rule and co- optation of Georgian nobles like Orbeliani into Russian service, is again  likened to the change of the natural order, witnessed in the domestica- tion of the animal fury of the Terek as it moves into Russia. Chavcha- vadze notes that at Vladikavkaz, in the plains, the Terek flows “as placid,  as silent, as if it dwelt under the rod or had received a high official post  (chini)” (II); or as Lelt Ghunia would have it, the stagnant water of empty  peace brought by Russia is for servile frogs, but free trout splash happily  in the torrential Terek (VII).  The prior Georgian and Russian Romantic descriptions of this land- scape with which Chavchavdze engages explicitly are notable for their  rapturous communion with sublime nature (and Chavchavadze’s is no  exception), but in them, the noisy natural order (the terrifying wild  animal roar of the Terek) is sometimes complemented by the complete  silence of cultural order (mountaineer “Terek-drinkers”). In the poetry of  Georgian Romantics like Aleksandre Chavchavadze or Grigol Oribeliani,  if local inhabitants appear, they are largely of a piece with the natural  order. For the Russian Romantic Griboyedov, the central and defining  feature of the landscape is the inhuman “noise of the Terek.” For Ilia  Chavchavadze, by contrast, the phusiomorphic noise of the Terek by slow  degrees is anthropomorphized into an articulate plaintive human voice  which is ultimately identified with the fully human voice of the Terek- drinker, Lelt Ghunia.12  Chavchavadze humanizes the natural order via a subjective revelation  that organizes the text, one which is mirrored in the natural order in  the changes in the flow of the Terek as he ascends from Russian plains  to Caucasian mountains. At first, a reluctant Terg-daleuli in the plains  at Vladikavkaz, where the Terek flows lifeless and silent, he refuses to  even look at, let alone drink from, the Terek, lest someone think him  a Terg-daleuli (II). Ascending into the mountains, the Terek, ever more  torrential, ever noisier, enters into communion with nature, finally  coming to feel “a secret bond—a concord—between my thoughts and  Terek’s complaint” (V). Chavchavadze transforms the inchoate noise of  the Terek into a human voice; first, the anthropomorphized voice of the  river, whose complaint, the complaint of his motherland, he comes to  understand (V); and then in the very real voice of the Georgian moun- taineer who dwells by the Terek, whose dialect-inflected voice Chavcha- vadze appropriates for his political message (VI–VII). The furious roar  — 45 — </page> <page sequence="19"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— of the Terek in the mountains now appears explicitly as the voice of the  free Caucasian mountaineers, who are, it needs to be added, also specifi- cally Georgian mountaineers. Having humanized the voice of nature, the  Terek, he now turns to naturalizing his relationship to the cultural order,  giving voice to the Terek-dweller.  Form and Content: Languages of Culture and Civilization  This revisionist geopoetics of the natural order is paralleled on the lin- guistic plane in two lengthy dialogues which Chavchavadze has en route  with representatives of the Russian state in the form of a drunken officer  (III) and of the Georgian people in the form of Lelt Ghunia (VI–VII), a  Georgian mountaineer peasant. The viability of a geopoetics that as- similates Georgia into Russia (characteristic of the older generation of  Georgian Romantics) is called into question when the Russian officer  reclassifies Chavchavadze from enlightened interlocutor to benighted  local when he finds out Chavchavadze is actually a Georgian. At the same  time, the parallel inherited geopoetic opposition between Caucasus and  Georgia is elided when the mountaineer Lelt Ghunia and plains-dwelling  Chavchavadze discover their common essential Georgianness underlying  their accidental differences of dress and dialect.  Further developing this revisionist geopoetics, Chavchavadze uses  the opposition between form and content in these two dialogues to show  that Russian civilization is a form with at best debased content, while the  traditional culture of the mountaineers, though expounded in the rather  homely garb of folk dialect, is revealed to be authentic. He thus reverses  the apparent value of form and content.  Chavchavadze continually defines and glosses terms to draw our at- tention to the opposition of form and content, but he works these de- vices differently in each dialogue, with different degrees of explicitness  of framing (Bauman 2004) and with important rhetorical effects. The  dialogue with Ghunia relies on implicit operations of glossing that allows  recognition of natural similarities within the heteroglossia of dialect,  and, moreover, recognition of Chavchavadze’s kinship with Ghunia as  Georgians. The linguistic relation is a fraternal kinship relation, there- fore Chavchavadze is truly an “organic” intellectual. Using dialectal dif- ferences as a basis for the recognition of natural similarities, meanwhile,  rhetorically resolves Chavchavadze’s anxieties about whether Chavcha- — 46 — </page> <page sequence="20"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  vadze will understand his country’s voice, the voice of Ghunia.  But what shall I do if my country tells me her complaint,  the secret causes of her sorrow, her hopes and despairs,  and I, unaccustomed to her language, cannot understand  her language, her speech? (III) But just as quickly, he concludes that there exists a natural kinship  connection between himself as patriot (mamulishvili lit. “child of the  fatherland”) and the fatherland (mamuli) itself, which would allow him  both to understand the complaint of his fatherland and to make himself  understood in turn: I decided that my country would receive me and acknowl- edge me because I am its blood and its flesh; I should  understand its words and speech because a patriot [mam- ulishvili] hearkens to his fatherland [mamuli] not only  with his ears, but with his heart too, which understands  even the unspoken words; I will make them hearken to  my words too, for a parent always listens to the words of  his child. (III)   The dialogue with the Russian officer, by contrast, works with radical  disjunctures between forms and meanings that are mediated only by his  own explicit fiat, by which he seeks to make the difficulty of “scientific dis- course” understandable to the unenlightened local, Chavchavadze. Again  the problem is one of failure of recognition. When first he learns that  Chavchavadze hails from St. Petersburg, he is full of great respect for an  enlightened visitor from the pinnacle of civilization in these benighted  parts. Upon learning that Chavchavadze is a local, “that is, a Georgian or  an Armenian” (III), he imputes a radically opposed identity to him; he  becomes full of contempt, and is merely glad that at least Chavchavadze  is a Georgian and not a despised Armenian (a topic on which both he,  Chavchavadze and Ghunia apparently all agree). Because it is revealed  that Chavchavadze is essentially a benighted (Oriental) local and only  accidentally resembles a (Western) visitor from a center of enlighten- ment, the Russian officer now assumes the role of an enlightener whose  task is to explain and gloss the complex terminology of civilization for  — 47 — </page> <page sequence="21"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— the backward Chavchavadze. Hence, where the first dialogue involves  implicit recognition of essential identity underlying apparent difference  of outward form, the second dialogue, premised on misrecognition of  essential underlying difference despite appearances, involves explicit  glossing operations that inadvertently reveal the obscurantism of the  civilizing pretenses of the Russian state.  At issue are two very different views of form and content in language.  One is a view of language, characteristic of Enlightenment thought  (Taylor 1975, 14), where signs and their objects, form and content, are  externally related (in that both sign and signified exist autonomously  of the sign relation, and are therefore brought together arbitrarily by  stipulative fiat), parodied by a reductio ad absurdum in the Russian of- ficer’s civilizing discourse (where French words are arbitrarily made  to stand for discordant Russian realities). The other (characteristic of  post-Enlightenment thought) is one where signifier and signified, form  and content, are internally related, mutually constituting, organically  interdependent, unable to exist apart. Here language is not merely an  arbitrarily chosen means of reference about independently existing,  objective states-of-affairs, but also expressive of, and therefore con- stitutive of interior, subjective essences (here, Georgianness). Such an  “expressivist” view of language is essential, as Taylor points out, to any  nationalism grounded in language (Taylor 1989, 415), and is certainly  central to the discussion of the relation of form and content in Chavcha- vadze’s dialogue with Lelt Ghunia. Hence, the two dialogues enact in  their implied theories of language Enlightenment discourses of “civili- zation” as opposed to post-Enlightenment discourses of authentic in- digenous “culture.” Just as Chavchavadze brings himself into an organic  relation with Lelt Ghunia on the basis of an expressive view of language  and authentic culture, he pries Russia apart from European civilization  by the arbitrariness and obscurantism by which Francophone civilizing  discourses are accommodated to Russian realia, leaving Russia in a no- man’s land between culture and civilization. In this process, he appears  to revalorize the received term Terg-daleuli itself, from a term meaning  “one who has received (false) enlightenment in Russia by crossing the  Terek” to one meaning “one who has found (authentic) culture among  the Georgians who dwell by the Terek.” — 48 — </page> <page sequence="22"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  Describing Dialect  Nowhere is the new concern for authenticity of representation of folk  language more clear than in the dialogue with Lelt Ghunia (VI–VII),  which resembles a folkloric text embedded within a larger prose narra- tive. The dialogue is a striking exercise in attempted literary realism: not  merely a sprinkling of dialectics for flavor, it is possibly the first system- atic, if distorted, representation of a nonstandard dialect of Georgian.13  Lelt Ghunia’s dialect is rendered in such a way that both its specificities  of form are highlighted, but also its essential Georgianness is at the very  same time retained. Dialectal difference within language is revealed to be  a kind of accidental difference within a framework of essential similarity,  differences of form of what are in effect the same words, so too differences  of dialect of what are the same language. So too, the differences between  the Moxevian peasant mountaineer Lelt Ghunia and the plains-dwelling  gentry Chavchavadze become matters of outward form of dialect or dress  that obscure an inner identity of Georgianness. Chavchavadze begins their first dialogue (VI) by a number of failed  gambits that make him resemble a Georgian noble of the previous  generation, failing to recognize Ghunia’s Georgianness underneath his  mountaineer garb, failing to recognize the human poverty writ large in  the entrancing natural beauty of the mountains. The remainder of the  dialogue in VI allows Ghunia to correct these misapprehensions. In the  following dialogues, the comparable terms of Chavchavadze and Ghu- nia’s dialect are emphasized in brackets. ‘Where [sadauri] do you come from?’ ‘Where [sadável]? From Gaibotani, here in the moun- tains on the banks of the Terek.’ ‘Are you Georgian or Ossetian [osi]?’ ‘Why would I be an Ossetian [ovsí]? I am a Georgian,  a Moxevian.’ ‘Your home is in a good place.’ ‘It’s not so bad [gonjái].* It suits our poverty.’ ‘Water and air like this are happiness itself.’ ‘Hm!’ laughed the Moxevian. ‘What are you laughing at [icini]?’ ‘I laugh [vicíni] at the laughable. An empty stomach  cannot be filled with those.’ — 49 — </page> <page sequence="23"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ———————————————————  -----------------  * Gonjai—cudi [gonjai –“bad”] (VI) If the first dialogue concerns Chavchavadze’s misrecognition of Ghu- nia as a possible non-Georgian mountaineer (an Ossetian), the second  dialogue (VII) involves Ghunia’s misrecognition of Chavchavadze as a  Russian, as if echoing Chavchavadze’s concern, that, as “one transplant- ed and reared in another soil” (III), he would not recognize his country,  and his country would not recognize him.  The substance of the dialogue deals with the defunct ethnographic  institutions of the Moxevians and the debasing effect of Russian po- litical domination and Armenian economic domination on the Georgian  people, both in the narrow sense (the eroba “(village) community,” the  traditional form of autonomous mountaineer polity) as well as broader  sense (the Georgian eri “nation, folk, people”).14 As Ghunia explains  the traditional ethnographic functions of an old monastery dedicated  to the Holy Trinity to Chavchavadze, Chavchavadze demands clarifica- tion about one of them, the people’s council (erta sabch’o), an important  institution of the eroba (here translated “community”), at which point it  is revealed that the institutions of the eroba no longer functions under  Russian rule:15 ‘What in the world is a council [sabch’o]?’ ‘A council [sabch’ói]? There is a cell there, where justice  was dispensed by judges. Whenever any serious affair  arose in Xevi it was judged there. . . .When there took  place in the community a great pursuit, any important  affair, a big election, the community went there, chose  as judges wise old men, men famed for their wisdom  [p’eit’róbit]*, set them up in that cell to judge. Whatever  these mediators then, in the name of the Trinity, having  asked grace from God, speak and decide, none breaks,  none infringes.’ ‘Have you been present at such a tribunal?’ ‘How should I have been present? I am telling you  tales of former days.’ ‘Why is it now [exla] no longer as it was?’ . . .  — 50 — </page> <page sequence="24"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  ‘Nowadays [ac’ína]? . . . Where is the community [eró- ba]? We are under Russia. Now everything is destroyed,  everything is changed.’ (VII)16 --------- *p’eit’robit—met’is gonebit saxelgantkmulni (p’eit’robit— “famed for great wisdom”) In both these dialogues, Chavchavadze uses the mechanisms of dia- logue itself, specifically questions, answers, and repetitions to establish  that differences of form overlay identities of content, an “outer clothing”  of different dialect forms of what are essentially the same words. Using  these devices, the translational equivalence of partially different dialectal  word forms as “different ways of saying the same thing” is established  implicitly in conversational question-and-answer pairs.  As can be seen from the examples above, Chavchavadze’s questions  are frequently met by a two-part reply from Ghunia. First, Ghunia  repeats a single word from Chavchavadze’s question as a question; for  example, Chavchavadze: sadauri? (“where from?”), Ghunia: sadável?  Chavchavadze: osi? (“Ossetian?”), Ghunia: ovsí? Chavchavadze: sabch’o?  (“council?”) Ghunia: sabch’ói? Chavchavadze: exla? (“now?”) Ghunia:  ac’ína? (“nowadays?”). This foregrounds the sundry differences of dia- lectal form (such as the pervasive marking of accentuation, for example)  between otherwise equivalent words, as if striving to ascertain whether  Ghunia’s words sadável or sabch’ói “mean the same thing” (or “are the  same words”) as Chavchavadze’s words sadauri or sabch’o. Then, Ghunia  answers Chavchavadze’s question in terms of its content, explaining  where he is from or what a sabch’o is. The organization of the dialogue  itself recursively divides off dialect form (the echo question) from  content (the answer). At the same time, the first part of the response  foregrounds differences of dialect form and acts as an implicit glossing  operation establishing the underlying equivalences of words.  Whereas this device allows the common Georgianness of words to  be recognized despite differences of “dialect,” Chavchavadze establishes  equivalence of meaning between different words through a separate  textual device, the philological footnote. The text has six philological  footnotes that offer glosses of Moxevian vocabulary (for example gonjái  “bad” in the dialogue above glossed as standard Georgian cudi “bad”).  These glosses are often presented denuded of other Moxevian formal pe- — 51 — </page> <page sequence="25"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— culiarities such as pervasive marking of accentuation, and thus as if they  are part of the standard Georgian vocabulary. Thus there are two stages  of “translation” of dialect into standard: a translation of form, by which  an unfamiliar word in the text (e.g., t’alávar) is glossed in the footnote in  a “citation form” denuded of distinctive dialectal features (e.g., t’alavari).  This is followed by a translation of content, where this word is glossed  by a standard Georgian word (t’anisamosi “clothing”). Thus, while the  dialogic system discussed above uses the same words to present differ- ent dialect forms, this system highlights the essential identity of words  across dialects, backgrounding accidental differences of dialectal form.  The footnotes present Ghunia as if he were himself an ethnographic or  philological text engaged in dialogue with his transcriber. If the dialogic  glossing discussed above produces a precarious equality between their  utterances and themselves as speakers of Georgian, the footnoting device  reestablishes Ghunia as a philological text (speaking a nonstandard dia- lect) and Chavchavadze as a philologist (speaking the standard dialect).  As “dialect” is the outer garb of words, so too do their different styles  of dress prevent Chavchavadze and Ghunia from recognizing their com- mon Georgianness. On their first meeting, Chavchavadze mistakes Ghu- nia for an Ossetian, for which he receives a testy rebuke (VI).17 In turn,  before he reveals his true opinion of Russian civilization, the peasant  Ghunia wants to know Chavchavadze’s mileti (derived from the Ottoman  term of ethno-religious classification, millet), assuming from his dress  that he is a Russian (VII). “I am a Georgian, can’t you recognize me?” is  Chavchavadze’s surprised response. “How would anyone recognize you?”  Ghunia replies, “You don’t dress like a Georgian. You resemble a Rus- sian.” Attempting to find a basis for mutual recognition that does not  depend on such outward forms, Chavchavadze makes special pleading  that Georgianness is not a matter of outward alienable form (dress), but  a more essential trait, represented perhaps by language. Ghunia objects  that “many speak the Georgian language, Armenians, Ossetians, Tatars,  other millets” (VII). Chavchavadze concludes that perhaps Georgianness  is not a matter of such relatively outward forms (dress, language), but  still more inner essence, a matter “of the heart.” Ghunia dubiously  agrees, noting merely that clothing, at least, has the advantage of being  visible. “Who can see into the heart?” he complains. For Chavchavadze,  Georgianness is an essential content whose recognizability is not im- paired by variation in outward form of dress or even language (though  — 52 — </page> <page sequence="26"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  perhaps it should be reflected or expressed in it). Ghunia, in turn, argues  that the outer form (dress) must express the inner content, or the outer  form becomes the inner reality. “In Russian dress, a Georgian becomes  a foreigner” (VII), just as the Terek changes its nature as it moves from  Caucasian mountains to Russian plains (II). Defining “Civilization”  The form of Lelt Ghunia’s speech is as humble as that of the Russian of- ficer’s is “scientific” and elevated. But in terms of content, the reverse is  the case. The historical predicament of Georgia is that the authentic cul- ture of the folk has been displaced historically by the empty forms that  Russian civilization has brought with it. Form and content are divorced  in reality as well as discourse, a chiasmus of high terminology and vulgar  referents of the Russian officer’s speech is mirrored in the realities of  Russian civilization.  The Russian officer is not the only representative of a civilized Europe  in this text. In fact, Chavchavadze’s first conversation at Vladikavkaz is  with a French traveler, who, mocking the notorious Russian postal carts,  appears merely to authoritatively demonstrate that Russians are not Eu- ropeans. “The whole of Russia travels like that? . . . Who in the world will  ever catch up with them?” is his snide observation (I). This rhetorical  separation of backward Russia from civilized Europe is continued in the  speech of the drunken Russian officer (III). This dialogue has the quality  of a “Through the Looking Glass” exposition of Russia’s civilizing mis- sion, presided over by a Russian analog of Humpty Dumpty, who glosses  over the gap between form and content by fiat. The officer condescend- ingly notes that Chavchavadze, like most locals (“that is, Georgians or  Armenians”), owing to his lack of enlightenment, does “not understand  logical, orderly reasoning” and probably does not even know the mean- ing of terms like civilizacia, associacia, arghumentacia, inteligencia, kassa- cia, and pilologia (III). Since, of course, it is soon revealed that the officer  himself does not know what these terms mean, it can be concluded that  he chose them on the basis of their purely formal properties, that is,  because they sound French and rhyme. Russian civilization is presented  as an empty form, a Francophone jargon consisting of words that rhyme  with civilizacia.  The scientific officer also engages in an explicit discourse of defini- — 53 — </page> <page sequence="27"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— tional glossing, which seeks to bridge the imputed gap between his po- sition as civilizing Russian and Chavchavadze’s position as uncivilized  local, conceived as a linguistic barrier between “scientific language”  and “vulgar language,” bridged by acts of “translation” that debase the  meanings of words. This glossing of “scientific” terminology (mostly of  European derivation) by “low” referents reveals the scientific officers  own lack of enlightenment, trading in high-minded abstractions for  low-minded vulgarities, revealing once again Russia’s claims to civiliza- tion as being a fundamental vulgarization of the real thing, the empty  form of civilization as opposed to its reality. For the drunken Russian  officer, the pinnacle of civilization is Izler’s Garden in St. Petersburg,  notable for its “fairies,” a scientific term he is certain Chavchavadze will  not understand: ‘Do you know what fairies are? That is a scientific word,  perhaps you don’t understand. If we translate it into  the vulgar tongue that means that the garden is full of  merry-eyed damsels. If you like you can take one by the  arm, and, if you like, a second. See what enlightenment  can do. Your women—as soon as they even see a man— they hide.’ (III) The scientific officer continues to help Chavchavadze understand  scientific discourse by this process of glossing, of translating scientific  language into the vulgar tongue: “It will be difficult for you to understand  scientific conversation, but I will translate scientific words here and there  into simple language and so thus make scientific conversation easy for  you” (III). He then proceeds, step by step, and numerous false starts,  tautologies, and asides, to gloss “enlightenment” for the unenlightened  Chavchavadze. In his asides, he inadvertently identifies the Russian im- perial metropoles of Moscow and Petersburg with the colonial outposts  of Stavropol and Vladikavkaz, that is, cities not larger than Chavcha- vadze’s own unenlightened Tbilisi, thereby undermining his assertions  of the self-evident superiority of metropole over colony. Let us follow the  culmination of his explanation: ‘Now when we begin by saying that your country is not  enlightened we must also say what enlightenment is. I  — 54 — </page> <page sequence="28"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  will explain this by an example; imagine a dark room— have you imagined it or not?’ ‘I have imagined it.’ ‘No, perhaps you have left a window open somewhere,  close it too.’ ‘I have closed it’, I said, and smiled. ‘Very good. When you fasten the window you must let  down the blind.’ ‘I have let it down.’ ‘When you have let down the blind the room is dark- ened, you can see nothing. Suddenly a candle is brought  and the room is illuminated. That is enlightenment. But  really, I tell you this cigarette is not bad. Is it from Peters- burg?’ ‘No, I bought them in Vladikavkaz.’ ‘It’s all the same. Now do you understand the meaning  of enlightenment?’ (III) Having defined enlightenment, the officer turns to measuring its prog- ress among the locals. “How does civilization go among you?” the officer  asks. Just as the unit of measurement of enlightenment turns out to be  lumens for the Russian officer, the dry measure of civilization turns out  to be “generals.” By “civilization” therefore, the scientific officer wishes  to know how many Georgian generals there are.18 When Chavchavadze  answers “about twenty,” the officer exclaims with disbelief, “This is great  civilization!” After considerable clarification of the “scientific” definition  of “general” (a matter ultimately having to do with mustaches and epau- lettes), he quickly determines the mathematical constant for the rate of  growth of civilization in Georgia, measured as a constant in generals per  year: twenty Georgian generals, seventy years since Georgia has become a  Russian colony, yielding a constant rate of two generals every seven years.  As the conversation becomes increasingly deranged, the officer re- veals an invention of his own devising that will give value to ordinary  flies (yes, flies), which will replace the complex and expensive machines  that are the engines of progress in European countries like France. As a  result of his invention, he cheerfully anticipates the beginnings of a bus- tling commerce in flies, with the result that soon there will be “fly shops”  all across the empire. Such inventions in the aggregate, products of en- — 55 — </page> <page sequence="29"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— lightened minds, which give value to worthless things, will lead to the  establishment, perhaps, of an Izler’s garden, symbol of enlightenment,  in Chavchavadze’s own backward town of Tbilisi, leading the elusive and  standoffish women of Georgia to promenade boldly. Hence, Tbilisi will be  transformed into a kind of paradise, the last term he tries to define for  the unenlightened Chavchavadze: “Then the people will see their para- dise, as the learned say, that is to put it simply . . . but what shall I say,  paradise in the vulgar tongue is also paradise.” (III)  Conclusion Chavchavadze represents the core of the Russian civilizing discourse as  a set of acts of translation and definition by which the officer attempts  to mediate the putative divide between himself as enlightener and  Chavchavadze as unenlightened local. The dialogue is the opposite of the  dialogue with Ghunia. It is a parodic lampoon of the empty pretenses of  the colonizing Russian state to a civilizing mission, confronted with a  “realistic” ethnographic account of the predicament of the peasantry. The  two dialogues, belonging to primary genres of parody and critical realism  respectively, are juxtaposed without authorial comment. The processes of  glossing found in each dialogue differ in degrees of explicitness of fram- ing, the dialogue with Ghunia leading to implicit recognition of kinship of  Georgians, the dialogue with the Russian a divorce of form and content  sutured together by explicit fiat. The dialogue with Ghunia reveals lowly  folk dialect to be a vehicle capable of bearing authentic culture, while the  dialogue with the officer reveals the “scientific” Francophone language of  the civilizer to be the empty jargon of a spurious civilization.19  By these various formal means, Chavchavadze constructs a complex  genealogy for himself as intelligent, establishing an overt literary gene- alogy that addresses his text as a son’s reply to a wayward generation  of Georgian fathers who have abandoned the Georgian people for the  Russian state (Orbeliani), and at the same time a covert sideward glance  is made to the affinal relations of these same Georgians among Russian  Romantics (Griboyedov). Distancing himself by opposing his kin within  the literary community of Russified Georgian society, Chavchavadze  turns to the people, establishing a naturalized fraternal kinship based on  shared language within the speech community of Georgians (Lelt Ghu- nia), which he can use as a foil for the empty claims of the Francophone  — 56 — </page> <page sequence="30"> ————————  Languages of Nature, Culture, and Civilization: Letters of a Traveler ————————  universe of discourse of Russian civilization represented by the Russian  state. At the same time, he revalorizes the term by which his own genera- tion of intelligentsia were already known, terg-daleuli, from a term which  implies a Russophile geopoetics of assimilation of Georgia to Russia via  enlightenment, to one which instead seeks to find authentic culture  among the Terek-dwelling mountaineers of the Georgian Caucasus. Chavchavadze’s Letters of a Traveler is in many ways a watershed mo- ment between the “Romanticism” of earlier generations and the “real- ism” of following ones. The “Romantic” allegorization of nature in this  work transforms the landscape into a series of intertexts through which  Chavchavadze can engage polemically with an entire series of Romantic  predecessors, just as the “realist” transcription of the human voice of Lelt  Ghunia makes this text the beginning of another intertextual series for  Georgian intelligentsia to write about Georgia. Russian Romanticism had  transformed the Dariel crossing into an intertextual space in which Rus- sians could constitute themselves as Europeans (Greenleaf 1991, 1994).  Georgian Romantics, in turn, by redescribing their own landscape in these  borrowed European-Russian categories, established their own coevality  with their Russian peers (Ram and Shatirishvili 2004, Manning 2008).  Chavchavadze’s appropriation of this Romantic discourse allows him to  contest all the major themes and presuppositions of the Russian and  Georgian Romantic imaginary of the Caucasus. In turn, Chavchavadze’s  Letters of a Traveler would spawn its own Georgian progeny. In the 1870s,  his Aesopian discourse of nature (indebted to Romanticism), figured by  the zoomorphic or theriomorphic, and then anthropomorphic Terek, and  his realistic transcription of the voice of the Terek-drinker Lelt Ghunia  on the northern boundaries of Georgia would provide a set of intertexts  that could be transferred to the southern boundaries of Georgia, allow- ing correspondents like S. Bavreli a discursive framework for an internal  Orientalist project of exploring the newly reconquered lands of “Ottoman  Georgia.” After the failure of this intelligentsia project of a rapproche- ment with the estranged “brothers” of Ottoman Georgia in the early  1880s, Chavchavadze’s thematic focus on the mountaineers of Georgia  as a privileged locality for pristine Georgianness of speech and custom  would bring a harvest in the immense explosion of realist ethnographic  and folkloric literature dealing with these regions Georgian press of the  1880s, beginning with the ethnographic and literary writings of the Mox- evian writer Aleksandre Qazbegi.20 While Bavreli’s writings continue the  — 57 — </page> <page sequence="31"> ——————————————————— CHAPTER ONE ——————————————————— hybrid aesthetics of Chavchavadze, continuing both the Romantic “Ae- sopian” discourse of nature (in the form of anthropomorphic rivers and  “expressive” landscape) and the “realist” transcription of the voices of its  people, the writings of later realists would firmly distinguish between the  natural (material) and human orders, “life” would become exclusively a  property of the people, and a realist description of “life” would turn reso- lutely away from even a fictional aesthetic anthropomorphism of nature.  While the bulk of this book will explore the former moment, the internal  Orientalist project of knowing the strange lands of first Western Georgia  (in the 1860s–1870s) and then Ottoman Georgia (in the 1870s), we will  skip ahead a moment in the narration to glance at the beginnings of this  second discourse of “our mountaineers,” a discourse which begins, once  again, with a revisionist reading of the Dariel crossing. — 58 — </page> </plain_text>
