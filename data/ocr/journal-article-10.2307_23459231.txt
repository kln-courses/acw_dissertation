Diehl's text) Probably these lines describe an actual encounter between the Parians of Thasos and a Thracian tribe- If we accept the comments which usually accompany them in ancient sources where they are quoted, they caused considérable shock by their frank disregard of the hoplite ethos,1 and made their author and his poetry unwelcome in Lacedaemon.2 It is a reasonable assumption that Archilochus was not the only Parian soldier to take to his heels on this occasion. Unless he was a con spicuous coward, an idea for which we have no evidence, his failure was part of the general collapse of his comrades' battle line. It is possible to regard the lines as a single epigram; they could certainly stand as such, since they make a well-rounded statement.3 It is equally possible that they are a section from a longer elegiac piece of the kind suggested by other elegiac fragments of Archilochus, in which the vicis situdes of fortune and warfare are discussed in the philosophical and consolatory tone that often characterizes this metrical form.4 The structural independence or otherwise of the four lines is not of absolute importance in discussing their effective interprétation. Nor is the variation in reading of line 3 of cardinal importance for this purpose, though it needs to be considered. I will state without prejudice that I intend to use the version xpvxT]v 8° êÇeoawaa ti [toi [xéÀei. aajtlç êxEÎvx] rather than the more solemnly Homeric expression printed above. The variations appear to go back to an early stage. The xp x&gt;xriv ô' ê^sadma version appears in our oldest reference to these lines in Aristophanes Pax 1298 ff. Another variant is avxòv §' êÇeoâmoa. The fine Homeric phrase involving ůavdxov xéloç5 would certainly be useful colouration for a 'parody' of Homer. It also neatly takes up the phrase ëvxoç d(icó)XT)xov — perhaps too neatly. The version quoted by Aristophanes was followed in the Neoplatonists' quotations, with the variation avxòv for ipupiv6 1 Aristoph Pax 1296 schol ad loc: Plut. Lac 34 239b; Sext Emp. Pyrr. Hyp. 3.216.

RANKIN It is not unreasonable to suppose that these had access to an Alexandrian version of the poeťs text, which possibly was influenced by the Alexan drian édition of Aristophanes.7 We cannot be sure of this; but the ver sion indicated by Aristophanes' text is certainly accessible to the sug gestion made by Platnauer: that Aristophanes may well have altered the words of Archilochus to suit his purpose.8 We can see probable indications of this in the comic exchange between Trygaeus and the son of Cleonymus. Lamachus' son is sent away by Trygaeus for singing only of war by means of a row of Homeric quotations; the son of Cleonymus is relied upon to sing a différent, unwarlike tune, which he does with the lineš: doiciSi pèv Eaťcov tiç and Trygaeus, ready for a jibe at the démagogue Cleonymus,9 a notorious coward, and a Qiijraajuç;10 says elite (xoi co itócr&amp;cov, êç xòv ctciutoC itocTÉQ' afieiç: (v. 1300). The son of Cleonymus attempts to continue his song: o|n&gt;xíiv §' êieCTcxcoffa, and is interrupted by Trygaeus brusquely with the phrase that complétés the hexameter metrically and at the same time dismisses the singer: xouiîctxuvuç ôè toxfjaç. The completion would not be available to Trygaeus if the elegant and more 'Homeric' version of the line were being employed. This is not in any respect conclusive, but it suggests the possibility that Aristophanes modified the text more drastically than by merely substituting Tvxf)v for aiitòv. The version which he gives us of the first part of the third line suits the Fifth Century's impression of Archilochus as being an especially rough and shamelessly individualist, almost indeed, a comic hero.11 If there were two versions available, there is no reason why the Athenian public, or Aristophanes, should choose the more dignified one- Both versions quoted have considérable similari ty: they begin with avxóq / avxóv for which Aristophanes substi tuted iJwxiW, and both end in the same phrase aairlc exsivri. The phrase p,oi is an easy completion of the ■xJníxV / avtòv §' elsaámaa version. Ultimate choice between the two is virtually impossible on the available evidence; but we may be permitted to suppose that différent readings of this poet's work could coexist at an early period, just as in the case 7 Aristophanes' plays were edited by Aristophanes of Byzantium: R. Pfeiffer, History of Classical Scholarship, Oxford (1968) 190. Archilochus was not fully edited, as far as we know, by Aristop. Byz. although admired and studied: Aristarchus provided his work with a commentary: Pfeiffer, 220. 8 Note 6 above. 9 Aristophanes attributes a whole spectrum of vices to him: K i r c h n e r, Prosop.

This was presumably the general reaction. From the run of his statement about Archilochus, Critias apparently thought that the act of throwing away the shield was the poeťs most disgraceful action.13 The advance and retreat associated with sea-raiding tactics are probably indicated by Archi lochus' words.14 The attitude of critics such as Critias and Plato is understandable in its social context. Also, in attempting to preserve their relatively recent crystallization of their ευνομία, the Spartane would react with horror both against his outspoken individualism and this particular example of jettisoning his shield, especially as it seemed to be accompanied with a notable absence of shame.15 Archilochus' point of view, however, was probably not unique among mercenary soldiers and prospecting colonists, types whom Archilochus studies in his poems, and whose characteristics he showed from the very nature of his wandering life. The επίκουρος, or mercenary, rather than the citizen patriot of the land-locked πόλις, provided the military paradigm which he could interpret, with his emphasis upon the advantage of being alive rather than dead, even if being dead means respectful memorialization in the πόλις.16 We have also the impression of men worked upon by varying experiences in their wandering lives so that 'are' what they do and feel.17 Certainly the idea that a shield can be replaced, whereas a man cannot, was unassailably correct, but it was not likely to confer military success upon a hoplite-line of its adher ents. Other ancient poets who assert their 'cowardice' in a similar vein, seem to recognize the anti-social character of Archilochus' view point and to rationalize it into a motif: námely that poets are special persons who cannot be expected to behave in battle like other men.18 Archilochus' words represent the practical view of the επίκουρος who stays in business by staying alive. In this fragment there is no claim to special bardic status.19 Modern critics, with generally more pacific viewpoints than their ancient counterparts, mostly have been sympathetic with Archilochus' point of view in these verses, and the putative action on his part which it describes. Our present concern is not so much with the biographical authenticity of the act itself as with the wider biographical problém 12 Index Hesychii operum Aristotelis, 144: 'Ajio(&gt;r|paTa 'Ag-yCkó-yov EùqijiîÔov êv {hfSXioiç y.

RANKIN of what the poet intended by this statement about losing the shield. The poet has been attributed with such varying attitudes in these lineš as: modest and humorous realism,20 or the sense of having fought so well that the mere shield can be disregarded,21 or determination to fight again.22 These are additional to the more obvious notions of comedy or satire of the epic. There is something incomplete about such explanations. Much more suggestive is the view that it is not his subjective attitude as such which is of interest, but its actual mode in its treatment of the epos.23 This mode is neither simple nor obvious· In some respects the poet seems to fit the modern character of 'anti hero'; but only, I suggest, in the sense that the 'anti-hero' is really heroic in his own individualist, non-conforming methods of meeting the problems of his world. His criticism of the Iliadic pattern of the conventional hero does not necessarily indicate disapprovai of the epic's emphasis upon individuai quality and achievement. It suggests more probably that he regarded many aspects of the paradigm as in appropriate to the real pressures and conditions of contemporary life. He was addressing himself to people who did not realize that the super ficial trappings of romanticized epos were not the reality either of epos' own world or the world in which they were living. The traditional image of the epic hero, since it was so conspicuously admirable in the eyes of such men as Glaucos24 also provided a good starting point for Archilochus' use of poetry as a means of persuasion as well as self expression: it enabled him to use the epic image as a rhetorical device for informing men's minds in a turbulent time of movement and colo nization. This aspect of his work was in the widest sense educational. In this he was following in the didactic tradition powerfully exempli fied in Hesiod, whose work had a distinct influence upon his poetry and ideas.25 Glaucus probably was never able to live down the parody of the first line of the Odyssey that Archilochus directed against him: τον κεροπλάστην οίειδε Γλαΰκον,26 but more than a merely mocking joke was intended. When Archilochus expresses his preference for a short bow-legged στρατηγός to a tali elegant one as a comrade in battle,27 he is criticizing standards of beauty which were admittedly of aris tocratic character and Homeric derivation, but he is doing so not with any necessary prejudice against beauty or Homericism in itself. The ap pearances that he appears to ridicule are represented as non-functional, and war was essentially functional. The bandy-limbed little στρατηγός whose shape enables him to stand firm in the hoplite line is, frcan an 'evolutionary' point of view better fitted for the activities of war than the tali Achillean type whose efficiency as an individuai champion 20 G.

There is also to be considered the fact that even epos on occasion separates warlike virtue from appearance: for instance, in the example of the unimpressively shaped but powerfully effective Tydeus;28 although we must balance against this the Iliaďs conventional identification of beauty-virtue in its criticism of Thersites' ugliness.29 In fg. 6D Archilochus is speaking about a military scenario which is technically différent from that of the epos. In the epos the question of being a qi^ccctjuç does not arise since the conditions of warfare made it unthinkable for a hero to throw away in retreat his only protection.30 The shape and size of the Homeric shield ensured protection for the fleeing warrior, and his position would be infinitely worsened if he were to discard it. It is the hoplite shield which is inconvénient in flight. Archilochus' military expertise was undoubtedly equal to dis cerning this différence in tactical science between the world of the epos and his own. On this hypothesis it would be reasonable to make the further inference that in using the vocabulary of epos to announce an incident that was alien to the ethic of the epic poetry, he was making an ironical challenge to those who believed themselves to be upholders of the heroic life-style of the older poetry However, his lines can be interpreted as having a more direct rele vance to the individuality of the soldier's life and experience. In using the phrase evxoç d[xcó|j,T|Tov to describe the weapon that was thrown away, he is not merely having a joke at the expense of epic pom posity;31 he is pointing out by means of the phrase the mere instru mentality, the detachedness of the shield and its irrelevance as a mere object to the notions of shame and honour that concern its owner. He draws a comparison between the condition of the soldier (especially the mercenary) as an instrument or merely functional element in the customary patterns of warfare, and the actually instrumentai status of the weapon which the soldier uses. Only the man himself makes a distinction between himself and the weapon which is 'blameless' and is beyond décision or failure; but the weapon is at the same time assimilated to the man by the anthropomorphic adjective which by an extrapolation of 'non-living' character on to him neutralizes the pressures of honour and prestige inherent in the archaic 'shame culture'. The word, which occurs once in Homer (M109), does not seem to reflect a regular Homeric formula. It is, however, used of a person, Poulydamas in the Homeric passage, and like aqiVcov,32 of related meaning, it most likely conveyed some overtone of moral judgement. Thus Archilochus criticizes the rigidity of Archaic Greek interpréta tions of the Homeric warrior's ethos. His words support the idea of the heroic man as a person who, if temporarily defeated, will yet fight again, and the frankness and apparent simplicity of their expression are strongly reminiscent of the open manner in which the heroes in Homer acknowledge without guilt their own failing and setbacks as 28 E. 801 f. 29 B 216 ff.; H.

RANKIN phenomena which are beyond their power to control and which ulti mately have to be accepted.33 Archilochus was no simple parodisi in these lines. They are parodie only in the sense that parody involves a parallel version to that of the original which it follows, a version which by the mere fact of its simi larity draws attention to the character of the original, and is not neces sarily 'absurď. By means of an 'alienateď représentation of the origi nal, parody can provide a new vision of the subject matter and art of the original.34 Archilochus was not primarily concerned with the paro dista comic intention of raising a laugh at the original, but rather with the current misunderstanding of the original epos. I suggest that he shows no desire here or elsewhere in his fragments to remove Homeric poetry from its pedestal of public respect. He is simply commenting on a wide-spread social attitude, using himself as prime example. The attitude in question is strongly flavoured by the tradition of heroic fighting derived from epos. His use of epic phraseology constitutes an associative symbolic shorthand, like the use of Biblical quotations in old fashioned Anglo-Saxon communities, and it is designed to con jure up in the minds of those who hear his lines images and assumptions appropriate to the argument which he intends. Without diluting the accepted general importance of epic as a source of vocabulary for the poetic diction of Archilochus and others of his time,35 it can be said that his adaptation of epic phrases in these lines serves the particular purpose of illuminating his theme and enables him to convey a large number of ideas and allusions in remarkably brief compass, having thus a special appropriateness. It represents a special adaptation of the general epic tradition in which he and other poets of his time were involved. 33 E. R. Dodáš, The Greeks and the Irrational, California (1951) Ch. I. 34 Cf.
