<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCED SPECIES Ecology of Biological Invasions. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1986. 166 pp., illus. $42.50 (cloth). Although recently there have been several texts that deal with intro- duced species, this volume will make a valuable addition to the libraries of both scientists who conduct research on introduced species and persons who are responsible for the manage- ment of a given geographical area. The title is somewhat misleading on three accounts: as stated in the pref- ace, the main focus of the book is on those species that have been intro- duced into Australia; several chapters present anecdotal information pub- lished elsewhere, as well as political, social, and economic considerations, and do not deal with the ecology of invasions; and the text assumes that all biological invasions are the result of anthropomorphic activities. The first consideration is not a ma- jor problem, because several chapters discuss how the Australian situation relates to similar situations through- out the world and provide extensive literature citations. For example, A. H. Arthington and D. S. Mitchell provide extensive lists of aquatic vas- cular plants and fishes that have been introduced into Australia, and pro- vide the reader with information on the impacts of these organisms on a worldwide basis. Conversely, A. E. Newsome and I. R. Noble concen- trate on those species that have invad- ed Australia, but provide a summary of those types of ecophysiological pa- rameters that contribute to the suc- cess of invading species. This list- which includes gap grabbers, compet- itors, survivors, swampers, habitat changes, gap filling, risk taking, com- petitive superiority, and predator re- lease-is applicable to many ecosys- tems, and thus is valuable to those individuals who study invading orga- nisms almost anywhere in the world. The second consideration may de- crease the number of individuals who will read and/or purchase the book. Although the first five chapters ad- dress the ecology of introduced spe- cies, the next four constitute a section on management of invasions. These chapters provide good information relative to the control and possible elimination of exotic species, but the information they provide tends to be parochial. Finally, the last three chap- ters are grouped together in an over- view section. A. Gibbs in his discus- sion of microbial invasions makes some generalizations, but for the most part provides anecdotal infor- mation. K. Myers discusses vertebrate introductions, but places great em- phasis on rabbits. R. H. Groves's chapter gives an excellent discussion of plant invasions and is one of the best, if not the best, paper in this collection. It provides information on species that have invaded Australia and also lists the characteristics of invading plants, including taxonomic position, homoclimes, ecological sta- tus, dispersal characteristics, seed dormacy, genetic systems, and modes of reproduction. Furthermore, areas of future research directions are given. Following the chapters are 12 sum- maries of posters presented at the symposium from which this text was generated. These summaries are of varying quality, and most, as might be expected in an abstract, raise inter- esting questions. Some, such as that presented by R. W. Robinson, G. W. Carr, and J. M. Robin, provide the reader with data and make some im- portant generalizations relative to or- ganisms that have become naturalized in Australia. I doubt that most of the information presented in these ab- stracts will be useful to readers. The title implies a broader scope than the one addressed-the text dis- cusses only introduced species and not other forms of biological inva- sions. Overall, I recommend this book to those involved in the study or management of introduced species. JAY R. STAUFFER, JR. School of Forestry The Pennsylvania State University University Park, PA 16802 Ecology of Biological Invasions of North America and Hawaii. H. A. Mooney and J. A. Drake, eds. Spring- er-Verlag, New York, 1986. 321 pp., illus. $59.00 (cloth). Introduced species have dramati- cally affected many ecological com- munities throughout the world and in some cases have replaced native taxa as the ecological dominants. These alien organisms and the processes by which they become established are the subjects of this book. The papers are from a symposium on biological invasions held in Asilomar, Califor- nia, in October 1984 and organized by the Scientific Committee on Prob- lems of the Environment. In a brief preface, the editors de- scribe a few of the dramatic effects of exotic species, such as their domi- nance in parts of Hawaii and south- ern Florida, their negative impact on agriculture and forestry, and their ef- fects on ecosystem properties. A ques- tion posed by the editors and ad- dressed in many of the chapters is, "What species will successfully in- vade?" An interest in exotic orga- nisms and a desire to accurately pre- dict which ones will successfully establish should make this book ap- pealing to a large audience. The high price is the one unfortunate feature. The book's 16 chapters are ar- ranged into six sections. The first section examines four groups that are common invaders: insects, fish, plants, and pathogens and parasites; the second section discusses attributes of invading species. Section three treats relationships between commu- nities and invading species, including community properties that favor in- vasions; the enormous economic losses in agriculture and forestry that are due to "pest" species, many of which are introduced; and the changes in ecosystem properties wrought by exotic animals and to a lesser degree by exotic plants. In the fourth section, J. Roughgarden pre- sents models of invasions, and in the fifth section four case histories are discussed. The final section consists of a chapter by D. L. Dahlsten on the control of exotic organisms. This book maintains a refreshing balance between animal and plant, microbial and macro-organismal, and theoretical and empirical, and even applied, studies. As is typical of many symposium volumes there is no sum- mary, synthesis, or analysis of con- cepts. Some interesting background information is also lacking. Ecology of Biological Invasions in many ways is an update of The Genetics of Colo- nizing Species (H. G. Baker and G. L. BioScience Vol. 38 No. 1 56</page><page sequence="2">Stebbins, eds., Academic Press, New York, 1965), where the papers were from a 1964 symposium in Asilomar, California. Despite the lack of a summary, readers will see several unifying themes despite the variety of orga- nisms and communities discussed. First, it seems unlikely that any gener- al theory will soon emerge. "Many ecologists have argued that the out- come of an introduction is unpredict- able... and I see little reason to think that the advances in ecological theory will change the situation in the next decade" (D. Simberloff, p. 24). "There does not seem to be any one biological feature that the successfully introduced species have in common ..." (P. B. Moyle, p. 32). "Further- more, it may be undesirable or even impossible to characterize a set of features common to most colonizing species" (F A. Bazzaz, p. 102). On the other hand, successful in- vaders are not a random sample of the species pool. Simberloff shows that certain orders of insects were more likely to invade than others. Mooney et al. conclude that birds are more likely to successfully invade than are mammals or reptiles. Several studies indicate that invaders typical- ly have high reproductive outputs, are easily dispersed, and are, phenotypi- cally plastic. Communities that are readily invaded also share some traits including frequent, anthropogenic disturbances. J. Ewel even cites ex- perimental evidence that demon- strates exotic species are more likely to become established in disturbed than in nondisturbed communities. In the summary of The Genetics of Colonizing Species, Ernst Mayr writes, "The one firm conclusion that I can draw is that it is quite impossi- ble to summarize this conference." The same still can be said particularly of the relationship between genetic variability and invasion success. Do levels of heterozygosity affect inva- sion success? Does the lag time be- tween introduction and rapid spread of exotics represent a requisite period of genetic readjustment, or is there simply a threshold "infection pres- sure" that must be achieved? The book's contributors have dem- onstrated the need for sound ecologi- cal, biogeographical, and historical approaches to the study of exotic organisms. Better understanding of genetic variability also is needed be- fore a comprehensive theory may be put forth. Even then, as some contrib- utors to this volume would conclude, there still may be a good deal of luck involved. BRADLEY C. BENNETT Department of Biology University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, NC 27514 THE NEW BIOMAGNETISM Magnetite Biomineralization and Magnetroreception in Organisms. A New Biomagnetism. Joseph L. Kirschvink, Douglas S. Jones, and Bruce J. MacFadden, eds. Plenum Press, New York, 1985. 682 pp., illus. $95.00 (cloth). The editors of this volume not only had the task of bringing together an extremely diverse group of specialists, but also of giving credibility to a subject that in the past has been looked upon with some suspicion. They succeeded very well in both endeavors. The volume is a compre- hensive compilation of works by 52 contributors, representing geological, physical, and biological disciplines. Such a broad approach will prove to be invaluable to researchers in many disciplines, especially biology. The 36 chapters of the book are organized into six major areas to pro- vide an excellent sourcebook for any- body interested in this subject. Each major area is introduced by a one- or two-page summary that provides co- hesion to the chapters and a rationale for their inclusion. Areas such as ex- perimental techniques and instrumen- tation, theoretical considerations of magnetoreception, magnetoreception and magnetic minerals in living orga- nisms, human magnetoreception, and biogenic magnetite in the fossil record provide biologists with excellent background material as well as good coverage of ongoing work in the bio- logical sciences and paleontology. As one reads this book, the signifi- cance of its subtitle becomes appar- ent. The growth and maturation of the study of the interaction of orga- nisms and magnetism is well docu- mented. Biomagnetism has come of age as a subject of research, facilitated by new or improved laboratory tech- niques (e.g., ultrasensitive supercon- ducting magnetometers and inexpen- sive magnetic shielding) and the discovery of magnetite in a variety of organisms. This book reflects the field's excitement. For example, it is now known not only that magnetite is found in many organisms, but also that many organisms display a re- sponse to magnetic fields. Although the linkage between these two facts has not yet been ascertained, various theories have been proposed. They are presented in this volume. In growing areas of research, there virtually always are problems of defi- nition; in the current volume, there is even ambiguity about the word bio- magnetism. The editors have chosen to confine the term to "studies which focus on the presence of magnetite." This relatively restrictive definition excludes all the works dealing with plants (e.g., germination studies and magnetotropism). Obviously, these additional large areas could not be included in a volume of this size, but perhaps a companion volume would be warranted. The editors confront head on the major disagreements that exist in the study of biomagnetism as they have strictly defined it. For example, the area of human research in R. R. Baker's chapter, "Magnetoreception by Man and Other Primates" is fol- lowed by T. Dayton's chapter, "Sta- tistical and Methodological Critiques of Baker's Chapter." These disagree- ments, however, do not detract from the book; indeed, they enrich it, be- cause it becomes obvious that there is considerable research currently tak- ing place. IRWIN R.
