The implicit contradic- tion between the view that Zeus is a symbol of all the forces in the universe and the central thesis that human reason is the ultimate moral force which triumphs over Zeus' unclear and self-contradictory authority is not confronted. Apparently Golden feels that the problems created for his inter- pretation by Aeschylus' picture of Zeus as the conventional anthro- pomorphic god of mythology are taken care of by the suggestion that the anthropomorphism is metaphorical. But his own meta- physical interpretation, no less than the rigid literalism which insists on a theological entity to correspond to every mythological figure, overlooks the nature of poetic language, which is to actualize not conceptualize. To call Aeschylus' actualization of Zeus as successor to Uranus and Cronus metaphorical does not do away with what the metaphor expresses, which is not a single supreme cause but a con- stantly unfolding relationship between several forces. The growth and evolution of Zeus can be denied because they are implied largely in the dimension of the plays not considered by Golden. Two among many possible instances are the language that assimilates Zeus' love for Io to Prometheus' creative fire, and the transformation of the instruments of Zeus' justice in Oresteia- bloodstained robe (net) of doom into red robe of celebration, hunt- ing animals into guarding animals (watch dogs), torches of destruc- tion into torches of consecration. This dimension, while it does not always confirm Golden's individual interpretations, strongly rein- forces his general thesis that Aeschylus' thought is both enlightened and profound. HELEN H.

Opinions as to what constitutes a good college text-book no doubt vary, but most teachers would probably agree that a student who is to see Roman history steadily and to see it whole should have a manual that is brightly written with its subject matter reasonably comprehensive and well ordered, free from heterodox viewpoints and above all factually accurate. The book under review, while un- doubtedly a serviceable companion piece to its author's volume on the Near East and Greece, does not everywhere conform to these standards. Too frequently its style tends to be "folksy" (" sybarite has come to mean a devotee of luxury " [p. 34]; "a detached joy that we should associate with head cataloguers in libraries " [p. 112]; "client nations, whom we now prefer to call satellites" [p. 221]; "a senator who is known as Pliny the Younger" [p. 459]).

Since the author as a rule very sensibly puts forward " the views generally held by scholars " [p. 44], his book is certainly neither wild nor unconventional: but it does ignore the First Sam- nite War completely, so that the Second emerges confusingly as "the first conflict" [p. 65]; and it does tend to belabour the thesis that Haywood propounded in his earlier Myth of Rome's Fall [see pp. 538, 566 f., 600]. Most serious is the presence of a certain number of positive errors. These may not be gross, but they can- not be ignored. Here are some examples: Plautus' Poenulus is not " the only good-sized text in the Phoenician language " [p. 16]; the Ager Gallicus was not " just below the Po" [p. 68; cf. p. 129] or Tarentum "in the instep" [p. 69; contrast p. 70]; Girgenti is no longer the "modern " name for Agrigentum [p. 120]; Tiberius did not return from Rhodes in A. D. 3 [p. 373]; the Roman army did not number between 150,000 and 200,000 in the first two centuries A. D. [p. 483]. And apart from the actual mistakes, there are some statements which, in their text-book brevity, will almost certainly mislead some readers: the uninitiated are likely to infer that the Salnite Wars were fought against the inhabitants of Campania [p. 25], that the native population of Sicily was Greek [p. 123], that Hadrian's villa is as close to Frascati as to Tivoli [p. 466], and that the Antonine Wall was of stone [p. 509]. The author's claim that his account is " necessarily short " [p. 621] is fully justi- fied; but for that very reason extreme care in the wording of sen- tences is essential. As a matter of fact he could have obtained more space by omitting extraneous material and the numerous repe- titions, and in that case his treatment at many points could have been less summary (the regime of Pupienus and Balbinus, for instance, is described without their names appearing [p. 532]; and the account of the fifth to the seventh centuries A. D. is compressed [pp. 573-594] almost to the point of incoherence). It is, of course, only too easy for a reviewer to damn a book by seizing on certain points, and it would be grossly unfair to dismiss Haywood's as a bad one (even though the above-cited examples of shortcomings could undoubtedly be multiplied). Actually the book is a useful and generally up-to-date compilation of material. It is not, in this reviewer's opinion, the best text-book of its kind, but it does contain some quite attractive features: it is of convenient format, contains fresh and unusual illustrative material, and gives good paragraphs on most of the important works of Latin literature. Many of its blemishes could be removed without undue difficulty should a second edition be called for. E. T. SALMON. MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, HAMILTON, ONTARIO. 377</page></plain_text>
