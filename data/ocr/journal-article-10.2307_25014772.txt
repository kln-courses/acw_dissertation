<plain_text><page sequence="1">Piety and Intellect at Amherst College, 1865-1912. By Thomas Le Duc. (New York: Columbia University Press. 1946. Pp. ix, 165. $2.00.) Based on a Yale doctoral thesis, this crisply written book is a good example of what can be done with a limited subject when it cuts across a broad field, and the author is alive to the importance of ideas and able to label them correctly and to discuss them objectively. Amherst is one of our smaller colleges but centrally significant in the history of American thought and education, because, in its stronghold of the Connecticut Valley, it was sired by and remained the heir of those who wanted to retain the New England Puritan-Congregational tradition and preserve it from the influence of "the apostasy of Harvard." Dr. Le Duc gets at the heart of the dramatic struggle for the survival in the United States of a Christian humanistic culture against the in roads of Unitarianism, higher criticism, post-Darwinian materialism, secularism, and the state-totalitarianism inherent in German idealism. He presents President Julius H. Seelye (1876-1890), and the Greek professor William S. Tyler (1836-1893), as heroic fighters in that losing battle, and Professor Charles E. Garman (1881-1906), as a teacher of philosophy who tried to save as much as possible of the great tradition while meeting the new conditions. The book should be of special interest to Catholic educators, both because they have had to face the same issues, and because they can point out that Catholicism is in a better position to solve them than was Calvinism. The principle was the relation of the natural to the supernatural, and of the abiding to the changing. Both the Catholic and Calvinist believe that the ultimate end of man is in the hereafter, and that a college should make Christians, but the Calvinist was convinced of the total helplessness of human nature, and of the possibility of salvation only through election. Moreover, while accepting only the authority of the Bible he called for its private interpretation. Dr. Le Duc does not</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 81 hide the consequences of such doctrines. If human nature is wholly corrupt, reason can at most help to establish the physical sciences, and religion must be the fruit of a grace-inspired intuition shared only by the elect. But such religious intuitions, unregulated by a guaranteed authority above them, inevitably lead to many interpretations, and at the same time the lack of authority above the text of the Bible may suggest too narrow interpretations, and leave it at the mercy of those who would attack its central truths because of the anthropomorphic terms in which they are expressed. An additional corollary of Calvinism was that the material prosperity of the individual could be taken as a sign of election, with a tendency to accept a rugged individualistic industrialism, while even naturalism could beget a humanit?rianism which called for more social justice. All this meant that the Calvinistic creed was fixed in ex treme positions which disparaged many worldly pursuits only to bless others, and limited the possibilities of reason in a growing rationalistic age which was to be followed by one which emphasized the changing. The nineteenth century's history of Amherst, therefore, exhibits at tempts to retreat from compromising positions, while retaining the Christian ideal. The primacy of personal salvation as an educational concern yielded before the study of science and social institutions; fra ternities and athletics featured the frank enjoyment of pleasure hitherto discouraged; gradually more emphasis was placed on scholarship and practical skills, and less on piety. Evangelical Christianity rebelled against the authentic spirit of Puritanism and conceived salvation as a blessing accessible to all. The early disparagement of the human intellect which had led to the authoritative textbook learning method was can celled by the importation of the German seminar and lecture system which stressed that all accepted knowledge was to be scrutinized as a preliminary to individual research. In consequence the liberal education tradition yielded before specialization. The library was increased and codified, incidentally by the inventor of the Dewey system. The study of the ancient classics which had been used for training in disciplined thinking and in formal writing, not to mention criticism on moral grounds, lost its prestige and primacy in the curriculum before the cry for facts, for new ideas, and for content expressed without undue emphasis on style. As Le Duc further expresses it: "The college gradually became a con federation of independent departments without apparent community of purpose or objective. In evolving from unity towards intellectual anarchy, it betrayed, it may be said, the plight of American civilization." Other close parallels to their own concerns should further interest Catholic educators, for instance, the gradual recognition by Seelye "of the obligation to practice goodwill beyond the point where it compassed the minimum of justice," and his growing sense of "the conflict between</page><page sequence="3">82 BOOK REVIEWS Christian principles and the prevailing social ethics." The author suggests at least another thesis that needs to be written, viz., the impact of the German universities on American education. But the many questions which his own thesis raises lead to the wish that like studies might be made for other colleges, as contributions to a better understanding of the devolution from Christian culture in American universities.
