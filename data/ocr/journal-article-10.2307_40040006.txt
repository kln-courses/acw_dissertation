<plain_text><page sequence="1">German Romanticism Goes to Hollywood: Heinrich von Kleist's "On the Puppet Theater" and Being John Malkovich Martin Kley, University of Texas, Austin In "Cyber-Kleist: The Virtual Actor as Uber-Marionette," Paul M. Malone draws an intriguing line from Heinrich von Kleist's essay "Uber das Marionettentheater" to digitally created "synthespians" such as Lara Croft. Malone states, "Despite the apparent novelty of the 'synthespian,' however, the substitution of actors by simulations was in fact anticipated two centuries ago."1 At several moments in his 1811 essay, Kleist re- verses the conventional argument of the puppet as poor replacement for the human actor.2 In a surprising move, Mr. C, one of the discussants in Kleist's essay, claims that gracefulness, not only in the puppet-theater but in the theater in general, can only be achieved after the removal of any human participation: But he believed that even this last fraction of mind, to which he had just now referred, could indeed be removed from the marionettes, their dance transposed wholly into the realm of mechanical forces, and, just as I had imagined produced by means of a crank.3 In my analysis of Spike Jonze's 1999 film Being John Malkovich, I will extend Malone 's line of thought and bend it backward.4 Whereas his argument connects Kleist's puppets with "new media" and the age of cyberspace, I will draw a parallel between the puppet theater and the movie theater, both of which are entangled with one another in the film. As a highly self-reflexive narrative about the cinema, I will argue, Being John Malkovich realizes Kleist's anticipation of the disappearance of the puppeteer by showing the frictions in the power relations of puppet versus puppeteer - actor versus spectator, respectively- in a struggle for identity and power. In this film, the actor and celebrity John Malkovich (played by John Malkovich himself) is used by the puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cu- sack) as a vessel, which he enters through a mysterious portal and which he learns to control like a regular puppet. The trajectory from passive reception through Malkovich's eyes to active control over Malkovich's Â© South Central Review 24.3 (Fall 2007): 23-35.</page><page sequence="2">24 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW life brings about two very different models of spectatorship. The latter model, rather than replacing the puppeteer with mechanics or the actor with an inanimate puppet, replaces the actor with the puppeteer himself. Highlighting intriguing correspondences between the two texts, I will then show how Being John Malkovich takes Kleist's ideas further and makes an intriguing allegory of cinema and spectatorship. This allegory reaches far beyond aesthetic concerns in showing that spectatorship and violence are inextricably bound together. From Being in John Malkovich to Being John Malkovich: Being John Malkovich as an Allegory of the Cinema The opening scene of Being John Malkovich conflates two characters of Kleist's essay into one image, the puppet and the young man from the episode that Mr. K. narrates. In this story, an adolescent loses his gracefulness while trying to consciously repeat a motion in order to imitate a well-known statue. In Being John Malkovich, both characters, the puppet and the adolescent, are unified in "Craig's dance of despair and disillusionment," which is performed by the wooden double instead of the puppeteer. The puppet recognizes himself in the mirror, shatters it, and starts to angrily destroy the rest of the room until he becomes entirely exhausted. Whereas the viewer is aware of the theatricality of the situation, the scene's imagery nevertheless switches from a conven- tional shooting of Craig's workshop performance to a digitized version that resembles a computer game. This sudden change of the filmic means in conveying the image illustrates Kleist's point of the disappearance of human agency in the puppet theater. Craig's hard work (we see him physically exhausted after the performance) is hidden by the film's digital technique for a few moments. Viewed in this light, film seems more capable than theater of hiding the devices with which it works, in other words, of hiding the strings. The crank of the film camera fulfills the task of Kleist's Kurbel (crank). But how could the puppet recognize himself in the mirror? Rather than considering it as an inconsistency, I view it as a blurring of lines between the human and the nonhuman, between real life and the stage insofar as it provides a kind of flash-forward to the human body that is used and abused by other human beings.5 The puppets are not just puppets but "action figures" (Cameron Diaz' Lotte) that all look exactly like the characters in the film. Craig kisses Maxeen first on the stage of the puppet theater then in real life. In the teatrum mundi of Being John</page><page sequence="3">GERMAN ROMANTICISM GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / KLEY 25 Malkovich, things originate in the theater and are only later enacted and performed in a theatrical reality. But what starts on Craig's harmless little private stage reaches a whole other dimension when he not only conducts his puppets but learns to toy with a real person using the famous actor John Malkovich in order to win Maxeen's heart (and mind) and launch his own puppeteering career. The film clearly raises the stakes: "See, it's not just playing with dolls," observes Craig after performing the same dance of despair and disil- lusionment again, this time employing Malkovich's slightly overweight body turned into a ballerina. Craig's lover Maxeen euphorically answers: "Oh, it's so much more, it's playing with people!" In repeating the same dance of the puppet from the opening scene, including the shattering of the mirror, Malkovich's body manages to unhinge the laws of gravity, as Mr. C. in Kleist's essay had wished. Interestingly enough, the film does not seek help from digital means in this scene. At this point, the human body is so deeply manipulated by the art of reason and is invested with desire that it has been turned into a sheer medium of performance. Malkovich has become his own body-double, a figure that is similarly absent from the cinema as Malkovich is now absent from his own life. Here we see a mode of spectatorship that varies dramatically from the first one, which was merely escapism. Being John Malkovich, for John Malkovich, means to be invaded and invented as a public persona. Ironically, it takes the unsuccessful puppeteer to turn the actor John Malkovich, who is not at all portrayed as a celebrity in the beginning, into a larger-than-life Protean figure, thus indicating how spectators literally make stars. And stars, even after several somersaults, never sweat. My point in comparing the two dance sequences is to show that the effort of the puppeteer, temporarily hidden in the beginning, is entirely absent during the second dance. Craig's perfection of the role as the puppeteer, the transformation of his profession from the puppeteer of the classical stage to that of digitally enhanced cinema, results in the naturalization or dissolution of the stage and allows him to "wear Malkovich's body like a very expensive suit" rather than "pounding it into submission." Or, as Andre Bazin has argued in comparing theater and cinema, the physical presence of the actor (or puppet) in the theater, causing a kind of rivalry between actor and spectator, makes way for a fundamental identification with the screen persona through the physical absence of the actor. The separation between puppet and puppeteer gets - temporarily, at least - dissolved. Another Craig, the poet Edward Gordon Craig, had also envisioned the vanishing of the imperfect human actor in his 1907 essay, "The Ac-</page><page sequence="4">26 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW tor and the Uber-Marionette," in which he picks up on Kleist's ideas. The poet argues: Do away with the actor, and you do away with the means by which a debased stage-realism is produced and flourishes. No longer would there be a living figure to confuse us into connecting actuality and art; no longer a living figure in which the weakness and tremors of the flesh were perceptible.6 But the namesakes' concepts of the disappearance of the actor could not be more opposed. Whereas Edward Gordon Craig sought utmost artificiality in order to do away with realism on the stage, Craig Schwartz seeks to merge reality with theater, a reality that is governed by the laws of the puppet theater with himself as the Uber-Puppenspieler. The portal through which to enter Malkovich's body and other "ripe vessels" turns Being John Malkovich into a kind of science-fiction film, however marked by the absence of science. Vanessa Pappas interprets the portal in "Conceptualising the Virtual and the Posthuman" as a metaphor for the internet: "Indeed, the word 'portal' has recently been appropriated to refer to those Internet sites that allow access to other sites in the virtual system by way of hyperlink."7 Borrowing a term from media theorist Stuart Moulthrop, Pappas calls the film an "interstitial fiction," a text that "maps the space between Internet culture and film as a representation of the real."8 From my perspective, however, the portal is more striking as a metaphor of the movie theater for several reasons. First, interpreting the portal as a movie theater is very much in tune with the film's overall self-reflexivity featuring a film star who stars as himself. The portal lets us peer through the eyes of a famous movie actor, linking the film from the outset to the cinema. Second, the dark corridor with the embodied screen-eye/camera-eye at its end and to which the spectator is driven with irresistible force illustrate the phenomenology of movie-going, albeit slightly exaggerated. The darkness of the movie theater and the isolation of the viewers from one another make the large and bright screen the only possible attraction. Moreover, Craig and Maxeen understand the portal's economic potential very quickly and transform it into an underground movie theater under the name of JM Inc. Customers pay two hundred dollars in order to be John Malkovich for ten minutes until they are spit out at the New Jersey turnpike. The first customer, in his own words a "fat man" who has the desire to be a celebrity if only for a short time, can represent a regular moviegoer who projects his desire onto a movie</page><page sequence="5">GERMAN ROMANTICISM GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / KLEY 27 star with whom he can feel identical for about two hours with the help of the illusionistic cinematic apparatus. At the same time, the portal on several occasions allows for a collective entering and therefore is more reminiscent of the movie theater than of the computer screen for individual use. Finally, with the exception of Craig, Dr. Lester, and his friends, the portal facilitates seeing, not acting. The customers do not become John Malkovich and are not themselves famous for ten minutes, but are reduced to their sense of vision - just as in the movie theater. Whereas the internet lets you actively navigate its space, film restricts you to the space of the diegesis as mapped by the camera. The passivity of the spectator is nicely illustrated by Dr. Lester's book on the right way to leap from one vessel to another. In the book, we see a depiction of a person who is imprisoned behind the eyes of the potential vessel. Inasmuch as the customers of JM Inc. fit this description, we can interpret the image as a viewer behind the iron bars of the star, as one model of spectatorship the film offers. This model links the cinema to Plato's cave, an often-drawn comparison, in which fettered human beings are unable to see the source of light except for indirectly through its reflections on the wall in front of them. This mapping of space by the camera-eye is thematized through its self-conscious usage of the point-of-view shots. Until Craig learns to control Malkovich's body, the film stresses the unnatural quality of looking through someone else's eyes by double framing, in other words, by adding a dark inner screen with fuzzy edges to the clearly delineated frame of the screen. This technique of the extreme point-of-view ques- tions the spectator's usual taking-for-granted of the camera as a perfect eye. As soon as Craig - in my view, as a stand-in for us as spectators of the film - has learned to dominate Malkovich, this baring of the device disappears from the edges of the screen. Craig's becoming John Mal- kovich corresponds to our becoming John Malkovich. At this point, we not only identify with the person on the screen as the passive model of spectatorship but also invent it. The puppet is taken over by the puppeteer with no strings attached to it. The disappearance of the self-conscious point-of-view shot (un)masks the merging of individual perspectives into a cinematic perspective. Unlike Mr. C.'s vision of the puppet, the role of the puppet in Being John Malkovich is not autonomous but is played by a director who is simultaneously a spectator. We do not need synthespians, the film seems to argue, in order to see how the movie star is constructed by his or her fans. Cinema as a phenomenon, especially the star system, is not only larger than life but also larger than just a role of film strip projected onto a wall. One of the things that make this film so</page><page sequence="6">28 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW extraordinary is to see how John Malkovich acts out the disappearance of his private life behind his sheer name, a change that is not noticed even by his close friend Charlie Sheen (played by Charlie Sheen). Ironically, Malkovich's life is not at all portrayed as that of a film star. John Malkovich would hardly be asked by the makers of the VH1 show Being to star in the show (which would be called Being John Malkovich then); in each of Being, a different glamorous star gives us insights into his or her daily life with a head-camera so as to create the illusion of us being them. We never see Malkovich during a shooting or at a public event, but we see him ordering bathroom rugs and check- ing on smelly food in the fridge. Here my interpretation of the film as a reflection on cinematic spectatorship seems to break down in that the movies are entirely absent from Malkovich's life to the extent that none of the characters in this film knows a single of his films. We have to ask: what is so exciting about being John Malkovich if we do not get what we expect of a star? Stars, not as real people but as a signification, are only significant insofar as they are stars. The star system depends less on the individual personality of an actor or actress than on the inaccessibility of the star as a phenomenon. Andrew Tudor makes a useful distinction with respect to cinematic identification. Tudor 's first two categories of star/audience relationship, emotional affinity and self-identification, take place during the viewing process. I would argue that the customers of JM Inc. are restricted to an extreme form of emotional affinity and self-identifica- tion by embodying the star. Craig's and Lester's taking possession of Malkovich, however, can hardly be grasped in those terms. Tudor's other two categories, imitation and projection, which take place outside the movie theater, are more apt to capture their relationships to their "ves- sel," although these categories still cannot explain why the parasites can fully take control over the host's body. I suggest adding a fifth category, "invention," in order to account for the constructedness of the star image off-screen, or, in Daniel Boorstin's terms, stars as "pseudo-events" devoid of content.9 For the customers of JM Inc., Malkovich simply provides the eyes through which they can watch reality TV and simultaneously identify with a star. For Dr. Lester and his friends, Malkovich is a random vessel that enables them to live forever. And for Craig, I would argue, it is only the name of John Malkovich that matters, including the social status that comes with it. In each of the three cases, the star is a blank that can be filled with any given purpose or desire.10 This also explains the choice of John Malkovich for the starring role: he is both a star and an anti-star, whose private life is relatively unknown to the public.</page><page sequence="7">GERMAN ROMANTICISM GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / KLEY 29 So far I have diagnosed two models of spectatorship and presented the film as an allegory of the cinema, claiming that the cinema, unlike theater, is particularly suited to realize the disappearance of the puppeteer. In my reading, the puppeteer can be found in front of the screen as the spectator who has a desire to merge with the screen persona. Being John Malkovich presents this paradigm shift of identification from passive consumption to active control - which raises a problem. In what follows, I will use the aforementioned more formal considerations and show why the protagonists of Being John Malkovich are caught in vicious circles of power, domination, and violence. Violence in Disguise of Aesthetics: Malkovich as Kleist's Mutilated Dancer I would argue that the key to the understanding of both Being John Malkovich and "Uber das Marionettentheater" is the issue of conscious- ness. Kleist's essay argues that it is exactly the lack of such that grants the puppet superiority over human beings. Human actors, Mr. C. argues, never find their natural center of gravity: Observe the young dancer F - when, as Paris, he stands with the three goddesses and extends the apple to Venus: his soul (in a manner fearful to behold!) actually settles in his elbow. "Such blunders," he added, interrupting himself, "are unavoidable, since we have eaten of the tree of knowledge. But paradise is locked and bolted and the Cherub is behind us. We must make a journey around the world, to see if a back door has perhaps been left open."11 A symbolic instance of the fall from grace (and gracefulness) is the above-mentioned episode of the ephebe who tries to imitate the statue of Narcissus. It is interesting that the adolescent's acquiring of consciousness is achieved visually, that is, by recognizing himself in the mirror. His identity formation, one can conclude, follows a social standard regarding how one is supposed to look; in other words, there exists a set of rules and conventions as to what is considered beautiful and graceful in soci- ety. Being aware of those conventions - in this case, the statue - throws the young man into the realm of the Symbolic. This belated instance of Lacan's mirror-stage, however, is presented here not as a purely psychic process. As Paul de Man rightly points out in his interpretation of Kleist's essay, the presence of the narrator makes it a triangular situation. Mr. K.,</page><page sequence="8">30 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW the narrator and educator of the young man, does not merely observe the scene but causes the young man's confusion by forcing him to repeat the motion.12 It would be hard to call it a coincidence that the essay's other episode dealing with consciousness, featuring a fencing bear that "reads" the opponents' souls with his eyes, also employs visual metaphors in order to expose the fallacies of consciousness. Here, the bear's lack of consciousness enhances his vision and unmasks the feigning of his human opponent. Kleist's romanticism, I conclude, harbors a strong aversion against the constructedness of consciousness and identity, striving toward a reintegrated version of the self as untainted by culture and reason. What is Being John Malkovich' s position with respect to the issue of consciousness and identity? The overarching and overwhelming importance of the gaze in the film suggests that there is no room for an authentic core of the self outside the realm of the spectacle; identity is essentially specular. At the same time, however, my reading of the film recognizes a social critique of the self's reduction to seeing and being seen - an unmasking in the form of Spiegelvorhalten - to stay within the metaphor, a confronting of the viewer by way of making him look in the mirror. When the wooden Craig of the opening scene recognizes himself in the mirror, he sees an unsuccessful puppeteer going through mid-life crisis. Hence the dance's name: "Craig's dance of despair and disillusionment." When Craig as Malkovich performs the same dance again later in the film, one would think that the despair is gone, since he has become one with his object of desire. But instead of the Lacanian symbolic empowerment, that is, the illusionary completeness with the mirror image often associated with the film image, Craig recognizes in the mirror the schizoid figure that he has become: again, plenty of reasons for despair and disillusion- ment. In spite of being Malkovich, Craig cannot entirely repress his old identity, which is expressed through his long hair and through the change of professions from actor to puppeteer. Moreover, the puppet with which he performs is not a mini-Malkovich but a life-size puppet of Craig. All of these clearly suggest that Craig, while pushing Malkovich into his own subconsciousness, is unable to repress his old self. The film's title "Being John Malkovich" is called into question because Craig does not succeed in being John Malkovich. On the contrary, Craig pays a high price for his image change, which is symbolized by the emotional scarcity of his life with Maxeen; she has herself all but forgotten Craig Schwartz and, even more so, his wife Lotte. Considering Craig's problems with his identity, it is quite understandable that Craig had called consciousness "a terrible curse" in the beginning of the film, an idea that is well in tune</page><page sequence="9">GERMAN ROMANTICISM GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / KLEY 3 1 with Kleist's main idea. Moreover, it is not by accident that he mentions this to his chimpanzee Aleisha. Kleist's Mr. C. states: "We see how, in the organic world, as reflection grows darker and weaker, grace emerges ever more radiant and supreme."13 While Being John Malkovich features puppets, animals, and human beings like "Uber das Marionettentheater," the film does not obey Kleist's romantic model of a circular as well as teleological movement from matter (puppets) to God, from absence of consciousness to total consciousness. Jonze's film, as I have shown thus far, blurs the lines between puppets and human beings, and even portrays Aleisha anthropomorphically in a flashback scene, including subtitles of the monkey's conversation with her parents. Even God cannot miss in the intertextual play in which the film engages Kleist's text, and, again, it is an anthropomorphic one. In a TV documentary about Malkovich, one of the commentators calls Malkovich a "God-like figure, who breathes life into inanimate objects and makes them live." Being John Malkovich makes an ironical comment on Kleist's speculation by reimagining God as yet another puppeteer and as a selfish God who toys with his own creation. The ventriloquist Craig, speaking through his puppet Malkovich, remarks in the documentary, "As the poet said, the puppeteer's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the pillars, the props to help him endure and prevail." The word "prevail" is well chosen here since it points to the aspect of power inherent in the puppeteer's profession. Craig's ability to prevail depends on the ability to deprive John Malkovich of his own life. I view the real Malkovich's entering into his own portal, probably the most remarkable and hilarious scene in the film, as a similarly ironic comment on Kleist and on the entire philosophical tradition of German Idealism invested in the Hegelian coming-to-itself of the spirit. Philoso- pher Fichte allegedly asked his students: "Think a wall! And now think the person who thinks the wall!" The dialectical progressive movement of the spirit is considered to be the driving force of history by German idealism. Kleist's speculation about absolute consciousness follows the same logic. Being John Malkovich shows the absurdity of this logic. When Malkovich enters his own portal, one could expect a coming-home of the self, a discovery of his soul. The portal, then, could be understood as Kleist's backdoor to paradise, in which nature and reason, subject and object, will be synthesized and reconciled. Instead, the door leads Malkovich into a restaurant full of Malkovichs in all shapes and sizes, into a grotesquely narcissistic or, better, solipsistic world of images of himself.14 More specifically, this scene is a reflection both on the human condition and on the cinematic condition. The uncanny proliferation of</page><page sequence="10">32 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW the Malkovich bodies, an invocation and exaggeration of the Romantic motif of the double, can only be achieved on the film strip in the sense that, due to the mirror image of the film, the actor is divorced from his bodily presence. As Walter Benjamin states: The representation of human beings by means of an apparatus has made possible a highly productive use of the human being's self-alienation. The nature of this use can be grasped through the fact that the film actor's estrangement in the face of the apparatus ... is basically of the same kind as the estrangement felt before one's appearance in a mirror - a favorite theme of the Romantics.15 It is as if for Malkovich the screen functions as a Spiegelkabinett where his image is at once reflected, distorted, and multiplied.16 This film, however, is less about introspection than about domination, less about aesthetics than about power. In becoming one with Malkovich as his object of desire and in realizing the Kleistian disappearance of at least the visibility of the puppeteer, Craig seems to be able to enjoy the gracefulness of his new life, which proves to be untrue. For once, Craig's old self comes back to haunt him. Even more importantly, the achieved unity does not satisfy him at all. Rather than flabbergasting the audience with performances of the kind of the aforementioned dance after having become the perfect actor, Craig starts a new career as a puppeteer. As the master needs a slave in the Hegelian system of thought, Craig has the need for puppets, the need for exerting his power over others. This film explores not so much the theme of unity as the theme of conflict. The positions of master and slave, puppeteer and puppet, and viewer and actor are not stable but remain the objects of constant negotiation and struggle. Craig's choice to redirect Malkovich's career, viewed in this light, shows his desire for a doubling of power: the power over Malkovich and the power over yet another puppet. Linking the issue of power back to the issue of consciousness, I view Craig's comment on consciousness as a "terrible curse" not only as a private burden but also (and mainly) as a social problem. Craig's personality connects consciousness with reason, more specifically, with the instrumental reason as is critiqued by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in The Dialectics of the Enlightenment. From this perspec- tive, consciousness distinguishes man from other beings but, at the same time, alienates him from nature and potentially from himself. Kleist was already well aware of this when he showed that the young man lost his natural beauty by acquiring consciousness, a consciousness that is socially</page><page sequence="11">GERMAN ROMANTICISM GOES TO HOLLYWOOD / KLEY 33 constructed and prescribed. By the same token, in another extradiegetic story in the essay, a bear, which embodies pure instinct, teaches a painful lesson on man's alienation from himself to the dancer, who embodies pure reason. Here, reason is the desperate aggressor whereas instinct is the sovereign defender. Rolf-Peter Janz convincingly argues that Kleist's essay does not strive to do away with reason altogether: Kleist refuses a model of reason only as proposed by the discourse of Enlightenment. It is in the context of this Enlightenment reason that Janz foregrounds the feigning of the fencer in the interpretation of the bear episode: The curious fencing match with the bear shows the lack of iden- tity on the part of Mr. Ð¡ ; it is precisely the rationality of the way he fights, the instrumentalization of reason for the sake of feign- ing, that demonstrates the alienation of reason from nature.17 In Being John Malkovich, it is art, more precisely, the art of pup- peteering, which is best suited to commit the perfect killing of Mal- kovich while preserving and abusing the simulacrum of his body: the perfect crime that, according to Jean Baudrillard, marks the victory of virtuality over actuality. Craig's wearing of Malkovich's body "like an expensive suit" allows me to make another connection to Kleist's essay, a brief narrative episode in which Englishmen fabricate artificial limbs that allow invalids to dance gracefully. Craig masks the violence done to Malkovich in a similar fashion as the artificial limbs and the dance mask the violence done to the war victims. In both cases, the violence is masked in disguise of aesthetics.18 Malkovich, in this interpretation, becomes Kleist's mutilated dancer. In Kleist, however, the relationship between consciousness and art is the focal point of his staged discourse on aesthetics, whereas the issues of violence and power are only hinted at. Kleist makes the actor and the puppeteer disappear from the stage and replaces them by value- neutral mechanics.19 The puppet is imagined as a counter-model of the Enlightenment's preoccupation with reason. In Being John Malkovich, the actor is also replaced by a puppet as the omnipresence and dominance of the puppeteer becomes all the more visible: not just in the theater and the cinema but in real life. If I say "real," I must add that reality must be understood not in opposition to virtuality but in combination with it. Virtuality is the medium or matrix in which the characters relate to each other; specularity is the way in which they relate to themselves. In German, I would call the film both an Inszenierung and a Selbst- Inszenierung, an updated staging of Kleist's essay and a self-portrayal</page><page sequence="12">34 SOUTH CENTRAL REVIEW of the actor John Malkovich as a puppet. I therefore propose to read the title "Being John Malkovich" also as a reflection on what it means to be John Malkovich for John Malkovich himself. As an actor, he plays roles by invading fictional characters, and in this film, he accidentally hap- pens to play himself and others who invade his body. As a star persona, Malkovich is imagined and invented by others, whether he likes it or not. In (n)either case, he has got the world on a string. NOTES 1 .
