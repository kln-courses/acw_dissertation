<plain_text><page sequence="1">PALLADIUSPALLADIUS OF HELENOPOLIS: A PARTY AND ITS SUPPORTERS IN THE CHURCH OF THE LATE FOURTH CENTURY1 τ1 I.I. Jerusalem ΤΗ Ε interest shown by the emperor Constantine and his family in promoting the holy places of Jerusalem and Palestine was calculated to make of the holy city the spiritual focus of the new Christian empire.2 The Golgotha of the Christians became the new 'centre of the world',3 while the Holy Land sites were the object of long journeys of devotion by pious travellers.4 This concentration of interest on the Holy Land had also its less desirable consequences, in that the church in that area of the Mediterranean had a ready audience before which to parade not only its splendour as the 'mother of all the churches' (the see of Jerusalem was so described by the bishops at Constantinople in 382)5 but also the squabbles and ravagings of ecclesiastical politics to which its position of prestige exposed it. This weakness became acutely apparent by the last decade of the fourth century, when the bishop of Jerusalem, under cover of the passions roused for and against the orthodoxy of Origen, found himself at the centre of a controversy which for a time placed him out of communion with an important and influential group of his parishioners in Bethlehem, and even drove him to the point of invoking the 'secular arm' to banish altogether his troublesome opponents from Palestine.6 The prestige of the church in the Holy Land in the Christian empire inevitably raised the dispute between bishop John of Jerusalem and the monks of Bethlehem far above the level of a local disagreement.7 1 This article is intended to accompany my 'St. Silvia of Aquitaine: The Role of a Theodosian Pilgrim in the Society of East and West', in J.T.S.

D. HUNT church were lifted out of a local context and presented to a much wider audience.1 This was achieved in no small measure by the continuing stream of pilgrims to the holy places, who would find it difficult to avoid becoming implicated, in some way or other, in the progress of the quarrel between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It is with one such visitor to the Holy Land that I am primarily concerned. In c. 3852 the young Galatian3 Palladius arrived in Jerusalem, at the beginning of a career as monk and bishop which was to bring him eventually to the forefront of the ecclesiastical politics of his day. In Palladius the themes of this paper converge: a stranger settled in the Holy Land, he found himself drawn into the enveloping controversy. The details of this involvement carry a special significance for the historian; for it is from Palladius' own record of the people with whom he was brought into contact that we are able to glean something of the pattern and extent of a powerful faction in the church at the end of the fourth century.4 This record is embodied in the so-called Historia Lausiaca, a compen dium of lives and anecdotes of ascetic saints, predominantly in Egypt, written by Palladius in 419-20 at the request of Lausus, then prae posituspositus sacri cubiculi at the court of Theodosius II.5 The authenticity of the historical framework of this document, which purports to be a per sonal record of Palladius' own encounters with holy men in Palestine, Egypt, and beyond,6 has in the past been hotly questioned—on the ground both that it is a literary compilation of earlier written 1 Augustine in North Africa observed the rift between Jerome and Rufinus, ep.ep.ep. 73. 6: . multum dolui inter tam caras familiaresque personas cunctis paene ecclesiis notissimo amicitiae vinculo copulatas tantum malum extitisse discordiae.' 2 Before his arrival in Alexandria, fixed as 388 (see below, p. 466 n. 4), Palladius had been some three years in the Holy Land: ILL. 44 (Butler, p. 131). I do not here enter into the problems of Palladian chronology: cf. J.T.S. N.S. 23 (1972), p. 355 n. 4. 3 Palladius as a Galatian: H.L. 35 (Butler, p. 102), Jer. ep. 51. 9. His family may have had estates there, cf. Dial, de vita S. Ioannis Chrysostomi (ed. P. R. Coleman-Norton, 1928), p. 127. יי Palladius' part in the 'personal jealousies and party passions which cloaked themselves under the mask of zeal for orthydoxy' was recognized by C. H. Turner, J.T.S. 6 (1904-5), pp. 345-6. 5 Still to be studied only in the magisterial edition of Cuthbert Butler, Texts Texts Texts and Studies, 6 (1898-1904); he reaffirmed the case for the Palladian authorship in 'Palladiana II', J.T.S. 22 (1920-1), pp. 144 ff.

It was the very fact that Palladius wrote from personal experience of the Egyptian desert, of arduous journeys across the empire in the quest of spiritual improve ment,6 which gave to his work its authority as a piece of edification. The importance lay, not in the chronological details of Palladius' autobiography (which are, in any case, likely to have been uncertainly recalled a generation after the event), but in his individual encounters as historical incidents. It is fundamental to the nature of the H.L., as I see it, that these encounters had actually occurred. This is by no means to deny that Palladius drew heavily on the popular tradition which surrounded the Egyptian fathers from a very early date;7 he shares many of his anecdotes, for instance, with the Historia Mona chorum, and a comparison of the two accounts of the famous Macarii 1 As (following Reitzenstein) W.

HUNT reveals an early confusion in the traditions.1 Significantly, the same element of tradition occurs in Rufinus of Aquileia's description of his meetings with the Egyptian monks: he has, for example, the familiar anecdote, which we find in H.M. and H.L., of Macarius' healing of the hyena cubs.2 Yet the historical reality of Rufinus' eight years in Egypt, and of his encounters with the desert fathers, cannot be called into question. Of Palladius the same must be said: the essential facts of his own experience were enriched with tales from the popular tradition3 to produce a work at once edifying and authentic. With his arrival in Jerusalem the young Palladius first emerges into history. He found there settled on the Mount of Olives an aged monk by the name of Innocent, with whom he was to spend most of the next three years.4 Innocent and his new colleague represent the first known 'international community' on the Mount of Olives.5 He himself was an Italian by birth,6 whom service at the court of Constantius had brought to the East, where his son became a member of the palace bodyguard. As a monk in Jerusalem he had witnessed the turmoil of the eastern church in the reign of Valens; Basil of Caesarea had written to him as one of his 'beloved brethen', affirming Nicene orthodoxy, and seeking Innocent's prayers for the peace of his soul.7 Innocent may well have owed his monasticism to the influence of Basil. The great Athanasius, too, could speak of 'our dear brother Innocent';8 and he may have supplied the remains of John the Baptist for Innocent's martyrium on the Mount of Olives.9 1 See A.-J. Festugiere, Les Moines d'Orient, 4. 1 (1964), p. 115 n. 1. 2 Ruf. H.E. xi. 4; cf. H.M. xxi. 15-16 (ed. A.-J. Festugifere, p. 127), H.L. 18 (Butler, p. 57). N.B. also Sulp. Sev.

Ep. ad Palladium presbyt., P.G. 26. 1168. It emerges that there was with Innocent in Jerusalem as early as 373 a Palladius, known not only to Athanasius, but also to Basil and Epiphanius (Basil, ep. 258. 2); he was assumed to be the author of H.L. by the D.C.B., but our Palladius cannot have been in Jerusalem as early as the 370s. The connection with Epiphanius may suggest the like-named magistrate of Suedra in Pamphylia, who became a monk and disciple of Epiphanius: Epiph. Ancoratus (ed. Κ. Holl, G.C.S. 25, 1915), pp. 3, 5. Cf. Butler, pp. 219-21. This identification does not, however, convince: Palladius of Suedra seems still to have been among the Christian community in that town when the Ancoratus was written, c. 374. י After the ravages of Julian's men at Sebaste, the remains had been re trieved and sent to Athanasius: Ruf. H.E. xi. 28.</page><page sequence="6">PALLADIUSPALLADIUS OF HELENOPOLIS 461 Nor was Innocent the only foreigner settled in the holy city by the early 370s. When Jerome had arrived at Antioch in 3741 he was able to write to another Italian monk living in Jerusalem, Florentinus;2 Jerome expected that Florentinus would make contact with his colleague Rufinus, whose projected arrival from Egypt was awaited—and ac claimed him for his hospitality to visitors, 'ceteros hospitio recipis, solacio foves, sumptibus iuvas' ;3 he would gladly have welcomed Jerome himself in Jerusalem,4 as he had in fact received another of Jerome's colleagues from the community at Aquileia, Heliodorus, who had recently been in the Holy Land on a pilgrimage.5 Already the holy places were beginning to serve as a centre of communication, and a focus of attention, for visitors to the East. It is possible to see in Florentinus a new point of contact for the scattered community from Aquileia: Rufinus, Jerome, Heliodorus, all found themselves linked together through his presence in Jerusalem. Alongside these developments at Jerusalem, the holy places of Bethlehem were also seeing the beginnings of foreign settlement. Perhaps as much as a year of Palladius' period in Palestine6 was spent in Bethlehem with an Egyptian monk, Posidonius, who had left the fastnesses of Mount Porphyrites for a cell near the Poemenion—the site to the east of Bethlehem where the shepherds were believed to have heard the message of the angels.7 We know, too, of another Egyptian, Pinuftus, who spent some time at the monastery near the 'cave of the Nativity' where John Cassian and his friend Germanus had come, as Palladius himself, to receive the rudiments of monastic life.8 1 For the circumstances of Jerome's first arrival in the East, see Cavallera, op. cit., pp. 25 ff. 2 Jer. epp. 4, 5; cf. Chron. an. 377 (ed. Helm, p. 248), Ruf. Apol. ii. 28 (ed. Simonetti, p. 105), with D.C.B. 2 (1880), p. 542, 'Florentius (47)'. (The manu scripts offer both 'Florentinus' and 'Florentius': cf. C.S.E.L. 54, p. 19, and G.C.S.G.C.S. 47, p. 248). 3 Jer. ep. 5. 2; cf. Chron. loc. cit., 'pater pauperum'. ♦ Idem, ep. 5. 1. 5 Idem, ep. 4. 1. 6 Pall. H.L. 36 (Butler, pp. 106 ff.). In placing this stay with Posidonius before before Palladius' departure for Egypt, I return to the view of Tillemont, re asserted by E. Schwartz in Zeitschrift fiir die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft, 36 (1937),(1937), pp. 162-3. If Palladius' stay in Bethlehem belonged after the troubles of the 390s, he could hardly have presented Posidonius' hostile remarks against Jerome as prophetic. Contrast Butler, p. 244. Moreover, the rapid events of 399-400 scarcely permit a period in Bethlehem (see below, pp. 471-4). 7 On this site, cf. Jer. Onomasticon (ed. E. Klostermann, G.C.S. 1904), p. 43; ep.ep. 46. 13, 108. to; Pet. Diac. Liber de Locis Sanctis (ed. P. Geyer, C.S.E.L. 39, 1898), p. 109; Epiphan. Hieros.

HUNT Such glimpses, which we owe to Palladius, of a former court official or an Egyptian anchorite settling in the vicinity of the holy places serve as an introduction to the era of western settlement in the last quarter of the fourth century associated with the famous names detailed above.1 It is to this era that Palladius' own links in the Holy Land belong, and we have now to survey the background to his involvement in the con troversy over Origenism' which dominated that period. Despite the amity which persisted between Jerome and Rufinus, at least at the level of polite cordiality, into the early 390s,2 the new monastic community in Bethlehem was beginning to look askance at what amounted to the formation of an ecclesiastical 'establishment' in Jerusalem. From their eminence on the Mount of Olives Melania and Rufinus extended their protection and patronage to the church of Jerusalem, lavishing their resources on buildings, church adornments, and all forms of charity.3 Perhaps more significantly, they had not held aloof from the church politics of the holy city. It is necessary to recall that by the time of Palladius' arrival the church in Jerusalem was only just emerging from the long period of turmoil during the Arian supremacy under Constantius and Valens; of this we have seen a glimpse in Basil's concern for the faith of Innocent and his colleagues. In 378 Cyril returned from the third exile of his turbulent episcopate to hold the see for the eight remaining years of his life,4 and his claims to be the legitimate bishop of Jerusalem were categorically stated by the eastern bishops at Constantinople in 382.5 But the church to which he had returned had been in a lamentable state of disunity: Gregory of Nyssa, who travelled to Jerusalem with a mission to mediate from the council of Antioch in 379,6 found his efforts frustrated, and returned appalled that the holy places which had witnessed Christ's earthly presence should be disfigured by such discord,7 especially at a time when the 1 Cf.

H.L. 46, 54 (Butler, pp. 136, 146). As an instance of Jerome's distaste for the material benefits enjoyed by the church in Jerusalem, note his jibe that bishop John was enriched by 'totius orbis religio', C. Ioh. Hier. 14 (P.L. 23. 366). 4 On Cyril's career, see, among others, W. Telfer (ed.), Cyril of Jerusalem and and Nemesius of Emesa (Library of Christian Classics, 4, 1954), pp. 19 ff.; G.

Where in all this do we find Melania and Rufinus ? Palladius points to an answer: 'they healed the schism of Paulinus involving 400 monks, and persuaded all the heretic pneumatomachi to return to the church'.4 Seen against the divisions outlined above, this seems to suggest that the westerners were actively involved in bolstering the position of the bishop of Jerusalem by bringing back his opponents into the Church Universal, a role which would accord with the reputations they had already gained in opposing the Arianism imposed in Egypt after the death of Athanasius.5 In particular, the 400 monks of the 'schism of Paulinus' surely belonged to the company of just those 'ultra-Nicenes' of whom Gregory complained: their champion was the schismatic bishop Paulinus of Antioch, who had no more convinced supporter than Jerome himself.6 In the knowledge that Melania and Rufinus had been instrumental in establishing Cyril in his see, the tensions with 1 Idem, ep. 3. 8 ff. 2 Idem, ep. 3. 10, 23. 3 Jer. Chron. an. 348 (ed. Helm, p. 237); Ruf. H.E. x. 24 speaks of Cyril's elevation 'confusa . . . ordinatione'. * * Pall. H.L. 46 (Butler, p. 136). 5 Rufinus was proud of his reputation as a fellow-sufferer in the cause of orthodoxy: Apol. ad Anastasium 2 (ed. Simonetti, p. 25), H.E. xi. 4—a claim repeatedly scoffed at by Jerome, e.g. Apol. ii. 3 (P.L. 23. 426). Melania's support of the orthodox monks was renowned: 'haec erat princeps vel particeps cunctis pro fide stantibus' (Paul. Nol. ep. 29. 11). 6 Jerome had himself been ordained by Paulinus, C. Ioh. Hier. 41 {P.L. 23. 393), whose resolute stand for orthodoxy earned him the title of 'confessor': Jer. ep. 108. 7, Apol. iii. 22 {P.L. 23. 473); cf. Chron. an. 362 (ed. Helm, p. 242), 'Paulinum . . . qui se numquam haereticorum communione polluerat'. The standard interpretation of this passage is to follow Tillemont, Mimoires, xii, p. 199 (e.g. Butler, p. 224; Cavallera, op. cit., p. 214 η. 4; Chitty, op. cit., p. 57) in supposing that for Paulinus should be read 'Paulinianus'; we are to understand this of the brother of Jerome, whose ordination by Epiphanius was a crucial incident in the 'Origenist' crisis. Could it be the case, however, that Melania and Rufinus should be mediators in a dispute where they were heavily committed to one side ?</page><page sequence="9">464 Ε. D. HUNT Jerome and his supporters emerge in a new light, their roots stretching back to the aftermath of the Arian period.1 The westerners' support of the church establishment reached its height under Cyril's successor, John. In addition to the continued material aid, Rufinus now served as a presbyter in John's clergy, and staunchly maintained the faith proclaimed by his bishop.2 John himself was in constant contact with the western community;3 and it is more than likely that the monks and nuns whom Egeria observed playing a leading role in the worship of Jerusalem included many from the monasteries on the Mount of Olives.4 The foreigner arriving in Jerusalem would thus be confronted by an ecclesiastical establishment dominated by the influence of the settlements on the Mount of Olives. When Jerome and Paula had returned from Egypt in 386 they had withdrawn to the comparative seclusion of Bethlehem, unable to rival the position of Melania and Rufinus in the holy city itself.5 Palladius, by contrast, settled (c. 385) on the Mount of Olives, and found himself drawn unmistakably into a circle of contacts which was to shape the course of his future career. His association with Melania is among the most pervasive to emerge from the pages of the H.L. :6 not only is she, 'the thrice-blessed Melania', the subject of three chapters in the work;7 she is also a principal verbal source for the stories of some of the Egyptian monks, especially Or and Pambo of Nitria, who had died by the time Palladius himself arrived in the desert.8 Melania and Palladius were neighbours on the Mount of Olives; there would be many opportunities for the young 1 Jerome did not forget the alleged Arianism of the bishops of Jerusalem: Υ.

Eg. 47. 4); cf.

Not long before, Jerome and Paula will have arrived and begun the establishment of their own monastic foundations. Palladius at least knew of Paula (even if he did not meet her), and spoke with admiration of her spiritual endeavours;4 but he averred that her aims were thwarted by the evil influence (βασκανία) of the Dalmatian presbyter Jerome, whose great command of Latin letters, allowed by Palladius, was vitiated by irredeemable faults of character.5 This harsh verdict on Jerome, written some thirty years after Palladius' own stay in Bethlehem, would hardly be surprising in the light of the 'Origenist' dispute and the crisis over John Chrysostom; yet it is striking that Palladius, who was eager not to rake over past controversies,6 even cared to mention Jerome at all, and then with so marked an air of aloofness and disdain ('a certain Jerome from Dalmatia'). He could not conceivably have adopted this tone had he succeeded in penetrating Jerome's circle in Bethlehem. The criticism of Jerome's influence over Paula echoes that which had surrounded his departure from Rome in the year before he settled in the East, when his standing in certain senatorial households had become the subject of scandal, no less in avowedly Christian circles than among traditional pagans.7 It is clear from the attitude of Palladius that similar charges continued to be levelled at Jerome even after the withdrawal to Bethlehem.

For him Jerome, besides being a man of incomparable learning,2 was a resolute fighter against heresy, a ceaseless critic of the faults of the clergy; his was a 'catholica scientia, sana doctrina', such that he was a proper object of admiration and affection by all right-thinking men.3 Postumianus was thus as committed to Jerome as was Palladius to Rufinus; both found themselves drawn inex tricably into the factions dividing the two communities in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, unable to remain outside the conflicts and hostilities of the world in which they had entered. II.II. Egypt After his 3-year period of 'training' in the Holy Land, Palladius moved on to the more fully-fledged asceticism of the Egyptian desert; in 388 he was met by the presbyter Isidore at Alexandria.4 This period was marked by frequent movement of pilgrims between the holy places of Palestine and the monks of Egypt.5 A visit to the desert was an indispen sable element in the western visitor's 'grand tour',6 while the Egyptian monks themselves did not neglect to make pilgrimages to the holy places—the brethren who recognized the monk Pinufius, for instance, staying incognito at Cassian's monastery in Bethlehem, were in Palestine on a pilgrimage: 'qui ad loca sancta de Aegypti partibus orationis causa convenerant'.7 Moreover Porphyry, the future bishop of Gaza, first arrived in the Holy Land as a young monk from Scetis on a pilgrimage to the holy places.8 Within the framework of these general contacts, however, we can isolate a more particular association which was maintained between the community on the Mount of Olives and the land of the desert fathers, stemming from the loyalties already demonstrated by Melania י For Postumianus see Sulp.

Palladius' removal to Egypt Egypt Egypt was paralleled by other such journeys during the period of Melania's presence in Jerusalem: most important of all was the with drawal of the monk Evagrius of Pontus from the Mount of Olives to the desert of Nitria c. 382.1 To this we can add the visit to Egypt in 394 by a group of seven monks, also from the Mount of Olives: having encountered the hermit John of Lycopolis in the Thebaid, they travelled down the Nile visiting other monastic settlements on the way, coming eventually to the monks of Nitria, and the Delta.2 It was to Nitria, on the edge of the desert,3 that Palladius withdrew after three years in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, thence retiring before long to the greater solitude of neighbouring Cellia, the 'Cells'.4 He was already familiar with a celebrated generation of monks of the Nitrian community from the reports of Melania, who had visited them all and testified to their ascetic virtues; she had even received from the hands of the great Pambo the basket he was weaving at his death.5 Melania could also lay claim to the sheepskin presented to her by the famous Macarius of Alexandria, alleged to be the very skin brought to Macarius by a grateful hyena after the curing of her blind cub.6 Macarius was still alive, as presbyter of Cellia, for the first three years of Palladius' stay there, and much of what he recounts of him in the H.L.H.L. stems from personal encounter.7 Palladius claims himself an eyewitness of the saint's healing-miracles;8 and the description of his appearance, 'slight and beardless, with hair only about his lips and the tip of his chin', indicates that he was a familiar figure among the monks of Cellia.5 The most significant influence on Palladius during his years in Egypt was undoubtedly exercised by Evagrius of Pontus, himself a 1 H.L. 38 (Butler, p. 120); see below. 2 The journey described in the Historia Monachorum, ed.

Having withdrawn to Jerusalem from an influential position as deacon in the church at Constantinople, he had been welcomed by Melania on the Mount of Olives; in order to prove to her his vocation to the ascetic life he had gone on from there to settle in the Egyptian desert.2 His may have been the precedent which encouraged Palladius in his withdrawal to Egypt. In his fourteen years at Cellia Evagrius gathered round him a particularly distinguished company of monks,3 among them the renowned 'Tall Brothers', the pupils of the Nitrian Pambo, who fled with Melania to Palestine under the Arian onslaught in the reign of Valens.4 One of these brothers, Ammonius, shared with Evagrius the acknowledged leadership of this community.5 It is beyond question that Palladius himself was a member of the circle around Evagrius: when visiting John of Lycopolis he announced that he came from 'the company of Evagrius',6 and the chapter devoted to him in the H.L. ('a man who lived as the apostles') is the principal source for his life, written, Palladius avows, 'for the edification of the reader and the glory of the goodness of our Saviour'.7 The influence of Evagrius, in both language and thought, has been detected throughout the pages of the H.L.% The intellectual ties which bound together this group of monks 1 For Evagrius, see A.

The last anecdote preserved under the name of Evagrius in the ApophthegmataApophthegmata recalls a conversation with the priest of Cellia, who is reported to have addressed Evagrius as follows: 'We know, Father, that if you were in your own country you would no doubt be a bishop and at the head of many; but now you are living here as a stranger.'4 That a great gulf existed between some of the local monks and Evagrius is made clear by an anecdote of another great outsider, Arsenius,5 and an unnamed interlocutor, widely taken to be Evagrius, where the two monks reflect on their inability, despite their education, to rival the ascetic virtues of the unlearned Egyptians.6 As in all else, the learning of Evagrius and his company was indicative of an interest not local, but 'international' in flavour, embracing also the community on the Mount of Olives; Melania, as well as Evagrius or Ammonius, knew her Origen.7 In describing the intellectual union which bound together this group in Egypt and the westerners in Jerusalem, Duchesne aptly concluded, 'Tout ce monde communiait en Origene.'8 The bond was cemented in the correspondence on spiritual matters which Evagrius exchanged with Melania in Jerusalem.9 Jerome, in 1 For Evagrian doctrine, add to A.

HUNT noting his translation of the Evagrian work 7repl anaOeias went so far as to label Rufinus, too, as a 'disciple' of Evagrius.1 In this context it is interesting to recall that in the prologue to his Praktikos Evagrius addresses an Anatolius, who had written to him in Egypt 'from the sacred mountain' with an inquiry about the significance of the monastic habit;2 we can surmise that Anatolius had in fact been writing from Jerusalem, the city of the sacred mountain of Sion.3 Thus contact was certainly maintained at a literary level between Jerusalem and Cellia. But we can go further. It is reported of Evagrius that Theophilus of Alexandria would have ordained him to a bishopric;4 indeed a Coptic version of the H.L. supplies the see in question, Thmuis, and the information that, to avoid this elevation, Evagrius fled to Palestine.5 As the Mount of Olives would be an obvious place of refuge, we cannot rule out the possibility that Evagrius returned to Jerusalem at some stage during his seclusion in Egypt. But our interest lies in the position of Palladius astride these links between Jerusalem and the Egyptian desert. The H.L. has nothing to say of any travels outside Egypt during his years with Evagrius; but we have learned not to look to this work for a complete autobiographical record.6 It is an attractive, but little substantiated, possibility that it was none other than Palladius who carried letters between Evagrius and Melania in Jerusalem; for among the letters of Evagrius is one referring to 'our brother Palladius' who had delivered some corre spondence—the name of the addressee, however, is unknown.7 Much more convincing evidence for a return to Jerusalem by Palladius resides in the letter written by Epiphanius in 394 to John of Jerusalem, as later translated by Jerome; this ends with a warning to the bishop of Jerusalem which, as I have discussed elsewhere, strongly implies that Palladius was on his way to Jerusalem at the time.8 The import of this passage may be summarized again here. Significantly, Palladius is for op. cit., pp. 613-19, and the material in A. van Lantschoot, 'Un opuscule inedit de Fr. C. Conybeare', Le Museon, 77 (1964), pp. 121-36. 1 Jer. 10c. cit. 2 P.G. 40. 1220 (cf. S.C. 171 (1971), p. 482). 3 For the possible identity of this Anatolius with a Spanish official, cf. Guillau mont, S.C. 171, p. 482 n. 1. Sion was the 'sacred mountain' par excellence for Evagrius, as the symbol of 'contemplation': e.g. Kephalaia Gnostica (ed. A. Guillaumont, P.O. 28. 1, 1958), v. 88, vi. 49. Thus this interpretation is to be preferred to the assumption of an allusion to the Mount of Olives. 4 Soc. H.E. iv. 23. 75■ 5 Cf.

This commitment was to be stressed again on two more occasions, at the 'Synod of the Oak' in 403,1 and by Jerome writing in 415, contrasting his own ruthless defence of orthodoxy with the heresy of his opponents: alongside Rufinus is named Palladius, 'Palladius servilis nequitiae eandem haeresim instaurare conatus est'.2 Palladius' alignment is emphasized by the conclusion, drawn from Epiphanius' letter, that his own arrival in Jerusalem was imminently expected; Epiphanius saw his presence there, at Rufinus' side, as a threat to the orthodoxy of John's con gregation. Palladius' identification with the party of Rufinus and Melania was thus complete, receiving its fullest expression in his being branded a heretic. A period in Jerusalem c. 394-5 would bring Palladius to the centre of the 'Origenist' controversy, precisely at a time when the ascendancy lay unmistakably with the community on the Mount of Olives: they were able to secure political support at court, in the person of the praetorian prefect Fl. Rufinus, against Jerome and his fellow-monks in Bethlehem; and (as I have argued)3 Palladius would find himself in Jerusalem in the company of no less a personage than Silvia, the sister-in-law of the praetorian prefect. Palladius' arrival at the holy places in the pursuit of a monastic vocation had thus led him inextricably into a political alliance; he had not remained aloof, and, in committing himself to Melania, Rufinus, and Evagrius, he was determining for his future a career for which he would be remembered, not so much as the aspirant to the spiritual life, but rather as a leading supporter of an ecclesiastical faction.

During the disputes of the 390s, the bishop of Jerusalem had found a welcome ally in the person of Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria:5 it was to him that he turned as patron and protector, and to him that he sent his own confession of faith.6 In the course of 399, however, a dramatic volte-face in the attitude of Theophilus led to the condemnation of the Origenism' of the Nitrian monks around Ammonius.7 Amid scenes of rioting and violence the 'Tall Brothers' were exiled from Egypt, and along with them Isidore, the ξενοδόχος of the church at Alexandria.8 Until only recently Isidore had been the trusted envoy and lieutenant of Theo philus, now to find himself branded as 'signifer hereticae factionis'.® Significantly, we should recall that it was this same Isidore who had first received Palladius in Alexandria, and set him on the road to ascetic devotion.10 The experience of the pilgrim Postumianus illustrates the effect of this new turn of events on a visitor to Egypt. Despite the offer of generous hospitality from Theophilus, he found himself unable to remain in Alexandria, 'ubi recens fraternae cladis fervebat invidia', and viewed with horror the treatment meted out to fellow-Christians by the bishops.11 In this atmosphere of bitterness the exiled monks fled first, and predictably, to Palestine—to Jerusalem, where they could expect to find a favourable reception from Melania on the Mount 1 H.L. 35 (Butler, p. 105). 2 Ibid.

One aspect of this offensive of Theophilus deserves to be stressed here. The bishop of Alexandria, we gather, complained to John of Jerusalem about his hospitable reception of supporters of the exiled monks;10 moreover, he pointedly emphasized that these supporters included certain 'foreigners' who had accompanied the monks to Palestine.11 Among such foreigners is likely to have been Palladius himself, who, I Pall.

We hear from Palladius of one monk who perished of thirst en route from Scetis to Cellia: H.L. 47 (Butler, p. 137). 4 Cassian, Coll. x. 2. 5 His writings, like the H.L., studiously preserve a diplomatic silence; indeed the impression left by the account, Coll. x. 3, of the conversion of Sarapion from his 'error' is one of success for the 'anti-anthropomorphist' side, the reverse of what in fact ensued—cf. Chadwick, op. cit. Despite the percolation of Evagrian doctrine through Cassian's works, the master is never mentioned, unless he be the monk from Pontus cited as 'erga puritatem sui cordis intenti et erga contem plationem divinam valde solliciti' in Inst. v. 32. 6 At p. 469. 7 That Theophilus may have felt it necessary to assert the authority of Alexandria over the monks of the desert can be deduced from the arrival in Paphnutius' community of one Photinus, described as a deacon from Cappa docia, and 'summae scientiae vir': Coll. x. 3. 2. The number of influential foreigners among the monks may thus have been much larger than just the group around Evagrius—Theophilus' fears of 'peregrini' would not be without founda tion (I owe this point to Philip Rousseau, in seminar discussion).</page><page sequence="20">PALLADIUSPALLADIUS OF HELENOPOLIS 475 see well within the ambit of the eastern capital,1 he could now openly assume that role of ecclesiastical politician which he had perhaps earlier disclaimed in his meeting with the hermit John at Lycopolis.2 The background will be familiar :3 Theophilus' battleground shifted to Constantinople, where the 'Tall Brothers' and their followers had arrived to be received cautiously, but with hospitality, by the bishop, John Chrysostom;4 with the death, however, of principal pro tagonists like Ammonius and bishop Dioscuros, the issue of Ori genism' was lost in the dominating rivalry between Theophilus and Chrysostom.5 Predictably, Chrysostom was able to find support among the exiles hounded by the bishop of Alexandria. Not only Palla dius, who saw his elevation to the see of Helenopolis as part of his 'sharing in the events concerning the blessed John',6 but also Cassian and Germanus, ordained by Chrysostom into the clergy of Constantinople,7 rallied to his cause. Palladius plunged straight into the fray at John's side: in the spring of 400, soon after he became bishop, he was present at a synod in Constantinople which heard charges against the bishop of Ephesus, and was himself a member of an abortive commission arising from these accusations; later he was present with John at Ephesus when another former disciple of Evagrius, Heraclides, was consecrated to the see.8 Like Cassian and Germanus, 1 In the reign of Constantine the town of Drepanum had been refounded in honour of the empress Helena, and named Helenopolis: Amm. Marc. xxvi. 8. 1; Soc. H.E. i. 17. 1, 18. 13; Philostorg. ii. 12; of. Ruge, Pauly-Wissowa R.E. 5 (1905), 1697, 'Drepanon (4)'. It was a 'court' city: Constantine, for instance, visited the hot baths there, Eus. V.C. iv. 61. 1, Soz. H.E. ii. 34. 2 H.L. 35 (Butler, p. 104). There is a hint in John's question 'Do you want to be a bishop?' that Palladius may have been pressed to assume the purple— as his colleagues Evagrius and Ammonius. Cf. D. J.

Along with this same Heraclides he was charged as an Origenist' at the 'Synod of the Oak' in 403;2 after John's exile and the order excluding his supporters from communion, he was among those bishops and members of John's clergy (among them Cassian and Germanus) who fled to the West to gain the ear of Pope Innocent.3 On setting foot again in the East, he was arrested and dispatched to exile at Syene in upper Egypt,4 where he remained at least until the death of Theophilus in 412; while there he will have put together his Dialogue on the Life of of John Chrysostom, pouring out his bitterness against the bishop of Alexandria.5 The extent of Palladius' involvement with Chrysostom can again be seen from a survey of the people with whom he is known to have been connected during this period. A number of 'holy women' whom Palladius had met, recorded in H.L. 41, and unfortunately dismissed by Butler as 'not otherwise known to history',6 can with great plausibility be identified with known supporters of Chrysostom. Adolia, a lady of Antioch, was an old friend of Chrysostom, who received several letters from him in exile: she was urged to make the short journey to visit him, or at least to write more frequently.7 Also at Antioch Palladius knew the deaconess Sabiniana, whom he describes as John's 'aunt'—it was surely the same Sabiniana who followed the bishop into exile and vowed that, were he banished even to Scythia, she would be at his side.8 1 He had been a deacon of Chrysostom for three years at the time of his consecration: Soc.

Sharing with Palladius this association with the Mount of Olives, she left no doubt of her sympathies by offering generous hospitality in the capital to the 'Tall Brothers' and their followers in flight from Theophilus.7 In 404-5,8 after the exile of Chrysostom, Palladius' support for the bishop took him to Italy.

HUNT the ascetic life, would not fall victim to the influence of Jerome's aristocratic friends in the capital.1 The tentacles of Melania's following in the West in the first decade of the fifth century can be seen to have embraced (beyond Italy itself) both Gaul and North Africa, effectively eclipsing the upper hand temporarily achieved by Jerome's supporters during the brief bishopric of Anastasius.2 On his diplomatic mission to rouse western consciences against the treatment of Chrysostom, Palladius found himself once again at the very centre of Melania's circle. In Rome he met Turcius Apronianus and his family, a new convert who owed his Christianity to Melania and Rufinus;3 he had been Rufinus' patron when he returned to Italy, and was the dedicatee of translations of Origen, Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzus;4 significantly for our theme, the partisan Apology against Jerome was also addressed to Apronianus, who, it emerges, was acting as Rufinus' 'scout' in Rome, forwarding to him the correspondence exchanged between Jerome and Pammachius.5 Apronianus' wife, Avita, who also received works of Rufinus, was a niece of Melania.6 In addition, Palladius and those who were with him were hospitably entertained by Melania's grand-daughter and namesake, and her husband Pinianus, at the villa on the Appian Way to which they had retired from the capital7—where we are informed that they lived out a life of practical virtue which, not least, included the reception of visitors.8 In meeting the Aproniani and Pinianus and his family, Palladius found himself in the company of precisely those two families who joined with Paulinus at Nola in a great reunion to celebrate the feast of St. Felix in 407.9 His affiliation with Melania had thus brought Palladius from a monastic cell on the Mount of Olives into the heart of an influential and close-knit group of the western aristocracy. 1 Cf.

Epilogue With Palladius' movements in Italy I leave my examination of the career of this diverse figure—traveller, monk, bishop, ecclesiastical politician, and diplomat. Throughout its varied phases it has been possible to trace a consistent and ever-deepening commitment to a distinct party within the church of the Theodosian age: a party which had its nucleus in Jerusalem, but which embraced too the Egyptian desert, and was eventually to include in its orbit both Constantinople and Rome, as it took on an explicitly political role in supporting John Chrysostom. It was a party which had incurred the antagonism of its opponents in the first place through local tensions in the Holy Land, but which soon found itself defending the heritage of Greek learning and of the Alexandrian Fathers against the onslaught of the 'heresy-hunters'. The varied aspects of Palladius' career point to a movement within the church at this period not unlike its exclusively pagan contemporary, that array of 'Wandering Poets' so well characterized by Professor Alan Cameron.1 Here, too, a group distinguished by a common cultural heritage found their way into prominent political positions, to become diplomats and men of influence in public life; from their homelands of the Thebaid their travels took them not only to the centres of power in Constantinople and Rome, but even on missions beyond the borders of empire. To set Palladius the bishop alongside his pagan coevals, Claudian of Alexandria or Olympiodorus of Thebes, is to emphasize that the regard for education and learning which all men shared was always there to overshadow the differences of religion; the pagan poet and the Christian bishop could both be the traveller-diplomats of the early Byzantine age. My presentation of Palladius has, admittedly, been a one-sided picture; there have been but occasional glimpses of the opposing faction which looked to Jerome at Bethlehem as its centre. This could command an influence no less widespread, reaching out even to the bishop of Rome;2 yet it must be concluded that, for most of the period that has been under discussion, it was a network of influence considerably less effective than that centred on the Mount of Olives. At the time when Palladius and Silvia were visiting Jerusalem c. 394-5, Bethlehem saw the arrival both of the aristocratic Fabiola from Rome and of the presbyter Vigilantius from Barcelona; but before long the one was hastily setting sail for home before the threat of 1 Alan Cameron, 'Wandering Poets: A Literary Movement in Byzantine Egypt,' Historia,Egypt,' Historia, 14(1965), pp. 470-509.1 owe this suggestion to John Matthews. 2 Anastasius: Jer. ep. 127. 10.</page><page sequence="25">480 Ε. D. HUNT barbarian invasion (and amid open hints from Jerome of the 'dissensio' prevailing at Bethlehem),1 while Vigilantius effected a sudden retreat to Egypt, having fallen foul of the Bethlehem monks2—he was to return to the West to fan the flames of opposition to Jerome.3 Perhaps Jerome's most singular lack of success was his inability to secure the 'loyalty' of of Paulinus of Nola, who, despite his initial appeal to Jerome as a master of the spiritual life, drifted into the camp of Melania (whose kinsman he was), and proudly welcomed her to Nola on her return to Italy.4 By the close of the fourth century the Holy Land was emerging as the effective centre of a Christian empire: traditional networks of aristocratic influence could now emanate from the holy places of Jeru salem and Bethlehem, and the rivalries and tensions which divided the two principal western settlements were transmitted along these channels through the Mediterranean world. Our study of the career of Palladius has enabled us to glimpse the significance for this process of pilgrims and visitors to the Holy Land, who, in themselves becoming implicated in these divisions and committed to a 'side', could not fail to accentuate this pattern on a wider scale, especially if, like Palladius, they moved into an active political role. It is a role which is submerged in the H.L.; for when Palladius, now settled in the Galatian see of Aspuna,5 presented this work to the praepositus Lausus c. 420, these tensions had subsided; the supporters of John Chrysostom were being restored to communion in the East,6 and in one of his last letters Jerome, writing to Augustine and Alypius in 419, could refer to the family of Melania's grand-daughter, recently arrived in Jerusalem, as 'sancti filii communes'.7 With the relaxation of the old divisions Palladius allowed himself but few allusions to the more turbulent aspects of his career: only in the dark predictions of John of Lycopolis8 and the mention of the anonymous 'exiled bishop' at Antinoe9 do we glimpse the fate of the partisan of Chrysostom.
