HARRIGAN Disease and Civilization amply demonstrates how vital it is to relate the history of medicine not only to political and socioeconomic factors but also to anthropological and intellectual questions. Those readers interested in the history of medical thought and the way popular beliefs influence medical and political opinion will find much to fascinate them. But urban historians concerned with institutional responses to epidemic disease and those interested primarily in the evolution and permeation of class attitudes might wish for a more fully documented and cautiously reasoned work. Anthony S. Wohl Vassar College The Superstitious Mind: French Peasants and the Supernatural in the Nine- teenth Century. By Judith Devlin (New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987) 316 pp. $30.00 The Superstitious Mind discusses popular beliefs in rural ninteenth-century France. Religion, witchcraft, demonology, prophecy, magic, and med- icine are the major themes, but werewolves, elves, and ghosts make cameo appearances. The book would make a fine reference point for any course in the history of popular culture or popular beliefs. Devlin draws abundantly from historical records and interprets them in the light of anthropology and psychology. She points out, for example, that both medical practices and certain religious rites are anal- ogous to modern psychological patterns of healing and treatment of hysteria. The book is stronger in its invocation of psychology than in its recourse to anthropology. It offers two major contributions and suffers one unfortunate weak- ness. It confirms prior scholarship in many areas. Popular religion was more anthropomorphic and utilitarian than spiritual. Healing was a mixture of religious and quasi-scientific practices. Ignorance and fear of nature led to a bestiary of threatening animals that existed only in the popular mind. Visions of elves and fairies were representations of con- flict, either internal or between human beings and nature. Devlin adds little to our knowledge of these topics, but demonstrates that traditional mindsets remained in rural France a century ago. The sense of continuity of belief is the second and more important contribution of this study. The author effectively uses documentation from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries to demonstrate the persistence of a variety of values and assumptions in rural France. She argues convincingly that the cosmology of the rural French changed little during those centuries. However much the Enlightenment, the Revolution, and gradual industrialization transformed some areas, su- perstition (I prefer traditional attitudes) continued. She argues, and I agree, that mass pilgrimages to Lourdes and less famous centers during</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS | 33 the nineteenth century should not be interpreted as a reaction to the tensions created by an urbanizing and industrializing society, but rather as a concentration of traditional belief and practice in a particular locale. Her persuasive argument for continuity is ultimately extended too far. She clearly demonstrates that there was continuity of belief over a number of centuries in some of the most isolated rural areas of France during the ancien regime and the nineteenth century. One cannot, how- ever, logically conclude from such a limited sample that superstition ruled nineteenth-century France, much less that it rules France today. The conclusion includes strident affirmations that the "superstitious mind" is basically the same today as it has always been. The author expresses her beliefs about the "behavior of the masses"-which she considers irrational-during the twentieth century, but provides no sources to support her assertions about contemporary behavior. "The contemporary fashion for obscure religious cults, the popularity of hor- oscopes and fortune tellers and the widespread receptivity to spurious medical theories" do not demonstrate that the influence of reason on twentieth-century man is tenuous (216). In any age some people think very differently from how the majority think, and some cling to tradi- tional beliefs. But collective mentalite is the issue, not the vestiges of mentalite among some. Mentalite in France, as elsewhere, did change from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. The reader should ignore the conclusion of this book; the rest of it is both informative and thoughtful.

By Jean- Pierre Goubert (Paris, Editions Robert Laffont, 1986) 302 pp. 92 F paper In my graduate school days a fellow student sardonically applied the label, "Victorian Sewers," to a seminar on nineteenth-century British social history. Goubert's new book, which examines the gradual ad- vances in water supply and sewage removal in modern French history, could conceivably persuade my friend of the subject's intrinsic interest. Goubert points out that basic features of modern civilization- running water, sinks, bathtubs, flush toilets, and sewers-are very recent innovations, the introduction of which required major cultural as well as economic changes. Nineteenth-century peasants associated manure with bountiful harvests and prosperity; why should they be concerned that the manure pile was next to their well? They believed that a good crust of dirt provided the body with a natural protection from harm, and that bathing should be associated with major rites of passage, such as birth, marriage, and death. Peasants were not alone in the notion that the stench of filth could help ward off disease; as late as I852 Alexandre-</page></plain_text>
