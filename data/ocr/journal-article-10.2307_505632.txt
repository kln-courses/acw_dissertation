ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT DOROTHY BURR THOMPSON Dorothy Burr Thompson, excavator, teacher, lecturer, writer, and preeminent authority on the coroplastic art of the Hellenistic period, has proven the value of patient and painstaking observation of the smallest details that mark the intricacies of the Hellenistic minor arts. Her work on the broken pieces of ancient terracottas affords fresh insights into that notoriously complex and ill-documented field, Hellenistic art. Her series of articles in Hesperia on "Three Centuries of Hellenistic Terracottas," and her books on the terracottas from Myrina (1934) and from Troy (1963) are indispensable guides to the complexities of the distribution and chronology of Hellenistic types. Whether she is dealing with the coiffures of Hellenistic queens, a coroplast's representation of a physical abnormality, or just a "miserable little head" of a "Graeculus who fawned upon the Romans," Dorothy Burr Thompson records a vivid picture of the tastes of the craftsmen and their public in the Hellenistic world, and-what marks her talent as extraordinary--places this picture in proper perspective to the major arts of the Hellenistic era. Dorothy Burr attended Bryn Mawr College and after earning her B.A. there (1923) attended the American School of Classical Studies at Athens where she began her career as an excavator by taking part in excavations at Phlius, Eutresis, and the Argive Heraion. She received her Master's degree (1926) from Bryn Mawr and after a year of graduate work at Radcliffe returned to Bryn Mawr for her Ph.D. (1931). She joined the Excavations of the Athenian Agora at their very beginnings, and continued after her marriage (1934) at the excavations until they were suspended during the war years. From 1948 on, she has served on the staff of the Excavations of the Athenian Agora, excavating and publishing. Now she is preparing the final publication of the Hellenistic figurines. After the outbreak of World War II, Thompson became a visiting lecturer at the University of Toronto and, for a year (1946-1947), was Acting Director of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology in Toronto, Canada. Her teaching did not stop when she moved with her husband, Prof. Homer A. Thompson, and three daughters to Princeton, New Jersey. She interwove with her career as an archaeologist visiting professorships or lectureships at the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, Oberlin College, The University of Sydney (Australia), and Princeton University. Her book Swans and Amber (1948), with its discriminating translations of lyric poetry and its well-chosen illustrations, reveals the sensitivity to literature that informs so much of her archaeological work. The right word, the apt saying, the relevant literary passage, enliven her lectures and her writings. She buries verbal nuggets hewn in her own inimitable style in the catalogues of artifacts where the niceties of precise observation bring life even to broken fragments. She uses her gifts not only to communicate with scholars, but also, through her lectures and writings such as those of the Picture Books Series, to illuminate for a more general public costumes, hair styles, gardens, shopping centers, and the details of the everyday lives of people who have left no names for history. 229 American Journal of Archaeology 92 (1988)</page><page sequence="2">230 THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING With pride in being able to honor a woman ahead of her time in balancing a career with being a wife and mother, with respect for her pioneering and exemplary work in understanding and interpreting the coroplast's art, with admiration for her contributions to our knowledge of the Hellenistic world, the Archaeological Institute of America awards its Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement to Dorothy Burr Thompson. POMERANCE AWARD OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA FOR SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHAEOLOGY GEORGE L. COWGILL George Cowgill has been for over two decades an international leader in the application of numerical techniques to the analysis of archaeological data. His specific contributions are manifold. In an age when archaeologists everywhere are grappling with enormous collections of artifacts, the advice Prof. Cowgill has given us and the examples he has set are more relevant than ever before. Already in 1964 he proposed a new approach to the extraction of meaningful information from large archaeological assemblages. Cowgill was an early member of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project, begun in 1962 by Rene Millon. The quanitities of data gathered at that metropolis were daunting and there were ample opportunities to apply statistical methods to the classification of artifacts, to the chronological seriation of ceramics, and to the construction of sampling strategies. Teotihuacan also supplied grist for the mill in many of his experiments with archaeological applications for computer technology. He described how he set up data storage banks and how he wrote programs to analyze the data; for example, maps of pottery distributions were generated for different phases of occupation at that great urban complex. Yet his interests have always extended far beyond strictly statistical or methodological concerns: he has investigated the factors behind the growth and decline of Teotihuacan, the extent of its trade connections, and its political relationships. The goal has always been to see not only the trees but also the forest. George Cowgill has contributed greatly to studies of prehistoric demography, offering thoughtful evaluations of the work of those scholars who have invoked population pressure as an important factor in culture change. At the same time he has refrained from harsh criticism of his colleagues, preferring instead to play the modest role of mediator and advocate. Prof. Cowgill holds advanced degrees both in Physics and in Anthropology. Since 1960 he has held posts at Brandeis University, currently as Chairman of the Department of Anthropology. In the Boston area he has played an active role in the Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology, and served the Boston Society of the Archaeological Institute of America as its first vice-president. For over two decades, George Cowgill has offered us levelheaded perspectives on the study of the past. A large proportion of archaeologists working around the world have benefited directly from his sound judgment and his clear prose. If it is true today that "the days of the innumerate in archaeology are numbered," that fact is in no small measure a result of the inspiration he has provided his peers, students, and a younger generation of scholars. It is with great pride that the Archaeological Institute of America presents to George L. Cowgill the Pomerance Award for Scientific Contributions to Archaeology.

SESSION I: PLENARY: SITE PRESERVATION MOSAICS: AN ENDANGERED SPECIES, Margaret A. Alexander, University of Iowa For many archaeologists, the preservation of mosaics in situ is a major and sometimes unwelcome problem. Whether mosaics are already exposed or are uncovered during exca- vation, certain decisions have to be made regarding respon- sibility for as well as methods to be used in their protection and preservation. Until recently, there was no forum for the discussion of policies, methods, and techniques for preserv- ing mosaics in situ. In 1977 the International Committee for the Conservation of Mosaics was founded. Well known in Europe, few American archaeologists seem to be aware of this organization and the wealth of valuable information it can provide. This paper is based on the committee's findings and recommendations as well as on personal experience as a mosaic specialist working with hundreds of long-exposed mosaics. Although few can afford to carry mosaic preservation as far as has been done at Piazza Armerina, certain steps can and must be taken to prevent the deterioration or destruction of mosaics left in place. This paper considers a number of major issues involved in advance survey and planning, and practical procedures. Issues relating to advance survey and planning include 1) thorough examination, recording and photographing of mosaics in their original context; 2) as- sessment of natural conditions (drainage, biology, vegeta- tion); 3) assessment of the condition of the mosaics; 4) how many and what mosaics can and should be preserved; 5) which mosaics are to remain in situ and which should be removed to a museum (geometric/floral vs. figural mosaics); 6) to lift or not to lift; 7) materials and procedures appro- priate to a particular site; and 8) availability of materials and trained personnel. Issues considered that relate to prac- tical procedures in the field include 1) repairs, restoration, reinforcement of foundations for mosaics left in situ; 2) lift- ing and returning mosaics to their original context (prepara- tion for and methods of lifting, types of bedding and prepa- ration for remounting, remounting, preparation of ground for relaying); 3) protection (temporary and permanent); and 4) maintenance. WALL-CAPPING AS A METHOD FOR CONSERVING Ex- CAVATED MASONRY STRUCTURES: Thomas C. Roby, International Center for the Study of the Preserva- tion and the Restoration of Cultural Property, Rome In recent decades we have witnessed an alarming rate of destruction of archaeological sites, destruction which could be avoided by planning ahead for site preservation prior to excavation. Such planning should prepare for the moment of excavation when uncovered materials are most vulnerable, and insure that long-term site preservation measures will be employed after the excavation process is finished. One of the most commonly used yet rarely discussed long- term preservation methods is wall-capping. By this method, a protective cap of mortar is applied to the tops of walls where mortar-bonded structural remains are most likely to deteriorate due to rainwater erosion. This method is gener- ally used when the excavated site remains are not conserved by means of backfilling or the construction of a protective roof. This paper reviews past and current wall-capping techniques at selected sites in Italy and England, and pro- poses more effective and aesthetically sensitive alternative techniques, such as "soft" wall-capping which employs lime mortars or controlled plant growth. These techniques re- quire regular maintenance for long-term protection yet pre- serve the irregular, ruined appearance of excavated struc- tures which hard wall-capping often radically alters. Wall- capping can also be a useful temporary site conservation measure when it is necessary to protect partially excavated walls between excavation seasons. With more careful atten- tion paid to this method, a major advance will be made in the preservation and authentic presentation of site remains. THE THREATENED DIALOGUE-SAVE OUR SOURCES: Carl Nylander, Istituto Svedese di Studi Classici, Rome Starting with an irreparably damaged dialogue scene be- tween the Emperor Trajan and a young officer, this paper, by showing a number of slides illustrating the serious deteri- oration of monuments due to air pollution in our cities, describes what is rapidly becoming a major threat to archae- ological evidence and thus to our primary source material for the study of the past. Reference is made to recent dis- cussions of the problem, to new research, and to new proj- ects inspired by this situation. The case is made that, while natural scientists delve ever more deeply into the causes of decay in stone, metal, and other materials, a major concern of archaeologists should now be to save our sources through the extensive and thorough documentation of important threatened remains. PROJECT FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE TEMPLE OF AUGUSTUS, ANKARA: Toni M. Cross, American Re- search Institute in Turkey, Emine Caner and Pam- ela French, Middle East Technical University The Temple of Augustus at Ankara was probably built during the first decades of the first century A.C. Constructed of marble on andesite foundations, it bears on its walls one of the most important inscriptions of the Roman Empire,</page><page sequence="4">232 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 the so-called Monumentum Ancyranum. Written in paral- lel texts, Latin and Greek, the inscription records the achievements of the Emperor Augustus, thus providing a key source for the early history of the Roman Empire. Over the last 30 years, air pollution has reached critical levels in Ankara. Examination of samples of marble from the temple by a team of scientists from the Middle East Technical University shows extensive gypsum crust forma- tion at the surface of the marble blocks. Exfoliation of the crust together with erosion of the surface by acid rainfall has already led to the loss of considerable areas of the inscription. The aim of the project initiated under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism is to ensure the long-term conservation of the monument. The work is planned in two stages. The first stage consists of 1) a full photogrammetric record of the building and inscription; 2) the construction of a temporary roof to protect the stone from the direct action of acid rainfall while further research into causes of deterio- ration is undertaken; and 3) a microclimatic survey of the building to identify sources of damp and the movement of moisture. The second stage involves 1) selection and appli- cation of a suitable long-term conservation treatment; 2) sta- bilization of the building as a whole; and 3) implementation of an environmental conservation scheme for the area around the Temple of Augustus and the Haci Bayram Mosque. It is hoped that the first stage of the project will be completed by the end of 1987. SESSION II A: MONUMENTA FATISCUNT: NEW INQUIRIES INTO FAMILIAR SITES, ITALIAN HISTORY, AND CLASSICAL AR- CHAEOLOGY IN ITALY LOST AND FOUND: DISCOVERY AND REDISCOVERY AT PAESTUM: J.G. Pedley, University of Michigan Paestum was lost to view in the Middle Ages to be redis- covered by Gazola and Soufflot in the 18th century, from which event the Doric Revival emerged, but not the ancient city which was forgotten again until this century. In the 1950s and 1960s came the great excavation programs of Ses- tieri and Napoli, the results of which, for a variety of rea- sons, have unfortunately gone largely unreported. It is only now that the situation has changed with the work of Greco and Theodorescu in the heart of the city and that of the Universities of Michigan and Perugia in the localiti Sta. Venera. Here an extramural sanctuary, briefly explored by Ses- tieri, has been rediscovered and its strange architectural forms identified, dated, and interpreted. What has been dis- covered as well as hitherto unknown architecture and asso- ciated assemblages-including important epigraphic testi- monia-is a geological history of the site going back to the fourth millennium that makes sense of the well-known Paestum croste or travertine deposits. The croste appear in four distinct chronological formations providing a geological profile interspersed with strata of datable volcanic debris from Vesuvius. These volcanic marker beds offer unex- pected possibilities for establishing stratigraphic correspon- dences with wide-ranging implications at large distances. EXCAVATIONS IN THE REGIA AND THE PRECINCT OF VESTA, 1987: R.T. Scott, American Academy in Rome The rediscovery by excavation of the Roman Forum at the turn of the last century and during the early decades of the current one is indissolubly linked to Giacomo Boni (1859-1925). From the area of his monument in the re- stored Farnese gardens atop the Palatine hill, the visitor to the city in the 1980s may conveniently view new work going on in places which Boni had disinterred-sometimes with remarkable speed-from 1899 to 1905, but which lan- guished in the sequel and had received no proper study or publication at the end of his life; the personality of the man, perhaps peculiarly suited to the temper of the times, is usu- ally considered the cause of their neglect. Among the areas being reexamined by the Archaeological Superintendency of Rome is that of the Regia and the old precinct of Vesta. The American Academy is working to trace the topographical and cultural relations of these sanc- tuaries to one another in the Republican period, and to elu- cidate their antecedents in the formative stages of the city's development which had eluded Boni in his day. THE FORUM OF TRAJAN AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CENTRO STORICO OF ROME: A LEGACY OF THREE EMPERORS: james E. Packer, Northwestern University Dedicated in A.D. 113, the Forum of Trajan has been witness to the contraction of Rome in the Middle Ages and its expansion after the beginning of the 19th century. The Forum collapsed in a ninth-century earthquake, was first systematically explored by the Napoleonic government of Rome in 1812-1813, and since then large-scale excavations by the Fascist regime of Mussolini in 1928-1933 have regu- larly been cited as the quintessential example of the massive urban planning of Imperial Rome. The plans and reports of these excavators, however, only hinted at the monument's architectural riches. This author, after a period of on-site measurement and study of the prin- cipal fragments of the main buildings (identified on the basis of archival evidence) extending over some 15 years, and the execution of the first accurate archaeological plan, believes that we can now comprehend for the first time the sophisti- cation and complexity of the Forum and suggest programs for its further study and its integration into the cultural ac- tivities of Rome's historic center. MORGANTINA: A MIDDLE HELLENISTIC CITY OF THE WEST: Malcolm Bell, University of Virginia American excavation at Morgantina began in 1955 and continued with a few pauses until 1971. Little had been pre-</page><page sequence="5">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 233 viously known about the site, the ancient name of which was not identified until 1957. Large-scale excavation on a tradi- tional model (Corinth, Olynthus) produced a wealth of in- formation on public and domestic architecture, cults, and the material life of the ancient city. Final publications, how- ever, were not completed. The University of Virginia-Princeton University project has concentrated on two objectives: gaining more informa- tion concerning the well-preserved Classical and Hellenistic agora, and assisting scholars in preparing final reports. In the agora we have attempted to establish a more accurate chronology, discovering that contrary to prior views the grandiose public buildings belong to the era of Hieron II of Syracuse. We believe that Morgantina was at this time the western bastion of royal Syracusan authority on the frontier of the Roman province of Sicily. Viewed as a city created by Syracusan patronage, Mor- gantina provides new evidence for the material life of the metropolis in the age of Hieron II-and of Theokritos. It bears a relationship to Syracuse analogous to that which Cosa bore to Rome. Yet, at the same time, as a market town it demonstrates aspects of provincial and rural life: the very extensive use of wood in public architecture, the availability of game in butcher shops, and the presence of large public granaries in the agora are among the aspects of the Hellen- istic city that have attracted our attention in recent excava- tion seasons. Our methods have to a large extent been shaped by history, in the form of the rather traditional exca- vation which we have inherited. While we have thus at- tempted to provide a full and accurate documentation of ear- lier results (with high standards of recording and drafting, and traditional study of material finds by categories), we have also subjected them to close historical, social, and eco- nomic analyses. THE CHORA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF METAPONTO AND CROTON: Joseph C. Carter, University of Texas, Austin Studies of the chora, or territory, of ancient settlement over large areas near major urban centers began in Italy in the 1950s with the Ager Veientanus project of the British School in Rome, and the work of Dinu Adamesteanu in Sicily (Gela) and Southern Italy (Metaponto and Hera- klea). These studies represent a shift in emphasis in Classi- cal archaeology away from object-oriented, large-scale exca- vations toward multifaceted investigations that focus on his- torical problems. They have been accompanied by techno- logical and methodological developments such as aerial pho- tography and surface survey. The results, once absorbed, cannot fail to alter the way the ancient world is perceived. The methods, in the meantime, have stirred lively debate within the profession. Since 1974, the University of Texas has been involved with the problem of the chora of Greek colonial Metaponto, and in 1983 it began a pioneering study of the chora of Cro- ton. The results of the Metaponto project-survey, excava- tion of various sites, and studies of organic remains-have been previously discussed. The purpose of this paper is to compare them with fresh results from Croton, where exca- vation began in 1987 at one of the ca. 500 sites identified by the survey. SESSION II B: ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY THE NEMEAN "XENON": COLUMN PLACEMENT AND THE ROOF: Lynn Kraynak, University of the Pacific Measuring 85.89 x 19.78 m., the "Xenon" at Nemea ex- tended along the southern border of the Sanctuary of Zeus in the last quarter of the fourth century B.C. A longitudinal east-west wall divided the building almost exactly in half; north-south walls at various points formed eight southern and seven northern rooms. Six of the seven northern rooms had a longitudinal row of reused, interior columns. In three of these rooms the columns ran along the longitudinal axis; those in three other rooms were south of the axis, 1.95-2.05 m. north of the southern wall. An explanation for the placement of these columns off the longitudinal axis may well lie in the ubiquity of reused blocks in the "Xenon" and in the builders' reluctance to re- cut blocks, seen in many places in the building. Faced with the task of cutting down a reused column drum or of carving a new one to make a reused column the proper height for placement along a room's axis, the builders avoided the problem by omitting a ceiling and placing the sets of col- umns according to their height in relation to that of the roof. This hypothesis is tested by using a Laconian ridge tile be- longing to the "Xenon" which gives a roof pitch of approxi- mately 11.39'. Assigning reasonable ratios of height to lower diameter in instances in which column diameters are known shows that the columns nearer to the ridgepole were taller than those running along the longitudinal axis and that the various column heights match the slope of the roof. "LARGE SITE" SURVEY, PHLIUS 1986: Susan E. Al- cock, University of Cambridge Archaeological survey, now firmly established as a source of information in its own right rather than merely a tech- nique of site prospection, generally has the archaeology of rural settlement as its central concern. A very recent innova- tion in Aegean archaeology, however, has been the extension of intensive survey techniques to large, even urban, sites. Examples of this type of field research on Keos and in Boeo- tia indicate clearly that survey can provide information about the higher levels of regional site hierarchies. In the summer of 1986, the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project extended its intensive archaeological survey over the inhabited area of the ancient polis of Phlius in the northeast- ern Peloponnese. The work involved a systematic recording and mapping of all remaining architectural features, fol- lowed by detailed fieldwalking of most of the site. Various levels of counting and collection of material were done for each of the site's 336 separate fields. The data collected in this way have informed us about the periods of occupation at</page><page sequence="6">234 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 Phlius, the history of the site's growth or decline, the shifting of functional areas, and the differing densities of occupation through time. An important feature of the methodology em- ployed at Phlius is its compatibility with that used through- out the rest of the 85-km.2 survey area, thus allowing the integrated study of a genuine urban-rural continuum. Phlius has been the focus of several excavation cam- paigns, most recently those of Prof. W.R. Biers (Hesperia 40 [1971]; 42 [1973]; 44 [1975]). The findings of such strict- ly localized investigations can now be related to the survey results, not only to amplify our understanding of past activ- ity at the site, but also to provide a partial test of the relation of surface and sub-surface material. It is argued that this methodology (properly managed and recorded) provides a new type of archaeological evidence-one not available through any other means. "OUTSIDE IN THE DISTANCE": SOME METHODOLOGI- CAL PROBLEMS IN UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY OF MYCENAEAN PALACE TERRITORIES: John Bennet, University of Wisconsin-Madison One of the key problems in the study of the Late Bronze Age Aegean palatial societies is how to develop our under- standing of the economic relationships between the palatial centers and their territories. This problem can only be usefully approached by combining archaeological and textual data available in order to maximize the amount of material for study. This paper takes a critical look at some aspects of the methodology which might underlie such an investigation. The methodological problems inherent in combining the two sets of data are twofold. First, the two data types are dissimilar in their chronological reference: archaeological data are refinable only to broad chronological limits (usually a generation at best), whereas the Linear B textual data refer to a single year's administrative activity at each palace. This problem is surmountable if regular features of the pa- latial records are chosen, which are likely to have been re- peated over a number of years and thus be reflected in the archaeological record. Second, we cannot simply "read off" textual against archaeological data: the one set must be "translated" into terms that are understandable in the other. Thus, we must devise archaeologically testable criteria for recognizing economic activities attested on the documents in the material record. If these problems are properly taken into consideration, the methodological advantages of combining the two sets of data are considerable. This point is briefly illustrated in three examples, which highlight aspects of the economic geography of the Mycenaean palatial systems. First, the ex- tent of the palaces' involvement with their surrounding areas is examined. The evidence-both archaeological and textual-suggests that such an involvement was selective, concentrating on a relatively small number of settlements through which commodities were moved. Second, the nature of the palaces' involvement is considered. Here the evidence indicates that the palaces were not managing the overall economy, but were simply exploiting settlements within their territories in order to access the goods and services they required. Careful archaeological analysis of sites away from the centers could test for the presence of strictly local eco- nomic patterns. Third, the question of changes in the role of the palaces through time can be examined by comparing antecedent organizations by means of the time-depth avail- able through archaeological evidence and comparing those with the period attested both in the documents and the ar- chaeology in the LH/LM III period. In this case, it is inter- esting that both the mainland and Crete show similar char- acteristics in the LH/LM III period, while their develop- mental histories differ considerably. THE VALUE OF MODELS IN MYCENAEAN ECONOMIC STUDIES: Holly Morris, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Although model building is a common research technique among archaeologists in many regions, it has had minimal use in the Aegean prehistoric periods. This paper examines the potential value of models in characterizing the Late Bronze Age (LH IIIB) economy in mainland Greece. After briefly describing the model approach and some of the benefits, pitfalls, and assumptions of model-building in archaeology, the paper goes on to outline the models of My- cenaean economy that implicitly exist in the literature: the Homeric feudal economy, the sacred economy, the redistrib- utive economy, and the "Asiatic," bureaucratic economy. Each of these models, or some combination of them, can be found in the bulk of the literature as unstated, sometimes unconscious assumptions. The paper shows how these un- derlying models have influenced the interpretation of ar- chaeological data. The third section of the paper proposes a new model of Mycenaean economy, called the prestige-goods state econ- omy. The model has been constructed to include an entire set of specific characteristics that can be tested and evaluated archaeologically. For example, one characteristic is a dra- matic growth in the elite industrial production of luxury goods to be used to insure loyalty among regional chiefs, and to exchange for non-local raw materials and other goods. The paper then provides examples of tests of this new model using selected archaeological data and then evaluates how well these data "fit" or account for predictions of the model. THE AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT OF DRY MASONRY DOMES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AREA: Barbro Santillo Frizell, Istituto Svedese di Studi Classici, Rome In the Mediterranean area, dry masonry domes were built from prehistoric times throughout history. The build- ing types of major archaeological interest are the Myce- naean tholos tombs, the Nuragic domes, and the Etruscan tholoi. In previous articles (Frizell and Santillo, OpAth XV [1984] 45-52 and Frizell in Sardininan Studies, in press), it</page><page sequence="7">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 235 has been demonstrated that these structures, contrary to common opinion, are not false cupolas but true domes, con- structed on the same statical principle and with the same intrinsic general characteristics as the commonly accepted true domes. On the basis of a documented process, I am arguing that monumental dry masonry domes are indigenous creations which develop autonomously from a previously acquired sense for stability in construction, which prehistoric man had gained through erecting kilns, granaries, and cisterns-- all members of the same structural family. The fact that dry masonry domes on a monumental scale are conspicuous in the Mediterranean area, where traffic and exchange were intense during the periods in question, has led some scholars to see them as a result of technological exchange. These ideas are based only on the structural typology without taking into consideration other factors, such as function and construction procedure. There are more similarities be- tween the Shetland brochs and the Sardinian nuragi than between the latter and the Mycenaean tholoi, and there are more similarities between the igloos of Greenland and the trulli of Apulia, although the distance in time and space pre- cludes a direct contact. Ancient peoples did not choose their natural environment but adapted themselves to it. Each culture found its particu- lar solution to a construction system, already matured in the preceding ages. The monumental domes must be seen against this background-not as isolated technological phe- nomena, imported fully developed from the outside, but as the maximum achievements in a long chain of minor efforts. CLASSICAL TEXTS AND CLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY: AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH: David B. Small, Lehigh University The basic approach to the use of texts in Classical ar- chaeology has centered on a "matching" process. Texts or analyses of texts are compared to the archaeological record (e.g., T. Judice Gamito, Archaeological Review from Cam- bridge 3 [1984] 90-98). While useful, this matching tech- nique is not as productive as integrative approaches, which use texts and archaeological material within a combined methodological framework. At present these integrative ap- proaches are limited to Minoan and Mycenaean studies (e.g., T.G. Palaima and J.C. Wright, AJA 89 [1985] 251-62). This paper argues that an integrative approach is also well suited to the later periods of Greek and Roman civiliza- tion. The methodology incorporates legalistic information from ancient sources into a preliminary cultural model of the people under study. The addition of this information en- hances the selection of ethnoarchaeological parallels by per- mitting the selection of cultures that are closer to the ar- chaeological culture than those chosen through similarity of archaeological material alone. An example is that of the Hellenistic royal community on Masada. An interpretation of legalistic sections from Jose- phus, Philo, and the Mishna is worked into a general model of social behavior for the community. This expanded model is used to pinpoint ethnoarchaeological parallels-here a community in Somalia-to explain further the archaeologi- cal patterning on Masada. The argument continues that the relatively good preser- vation of numerous ancient legal texts, both Greek and Ro- man, offers the Classical archaeologist an excellent opportu- nity to use integrative approaches in several other areas as well. THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF LOCAL SETTLEMENTS IN HELLENISTIC RHODES: E.E. Rice, Oxford University Although the well-known political history of the island of Rhodes was centered in the new federal city "Rhodos" after its foundation in 408 B.C., the old cities of Lindos, Kamiros, and Ialysos and their adjacent lands remained important places of habitation, local administration, and civic religion. Archaeological surveys alone can determine the location of the smaller geographical units of the island, namely the demes into which the population of the three old cities was divided, and even the individual habitation sites of which the demes were composed. The system of territorial division is largely based on the ravines which divide the island, and in the hinterland of Rhodes little-known remains on the ground show that a defensible position, available acropolis, arable land, and a water supply were important considera- tions for population centers. The situation is comparable in the mountainous Peraea, the area of southwest Turkey which belonged to Rhodes in antiquity. The substantial re- mains and surprising fortifications of sites which were smaller than deme centers indicate that the countryside re- mained inhabited throughout the Hellenistic period and supported a large population, a fact which has often been ignored. Although the rural population centers may have been both politically and culturally backward in comparison with the wealthy capital city, daily life in Rhodian territory was still based on the land, and gives a different picture of Rhodian history than what is known from the debates of the federal assembly reported in the pages of Polybius. KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THOUGHTS ON A METHODOLOGY: Seamus Ross, Ox- ford University This paper examines the ways in which research in arti- ficial intelligence, and, in particular, advances in expert sys- tem theory and knowledge representation will alter the manner in which archaeologists organize information, in- vestigate material culture, build models, and interpret the past. Expert systems can be applied across the spectrum of archaeological research; areas of application might include: artifact classification, iconographic analysis, the study of or- ganic remains (ranging from systems to assist in the identifi- cation of bones to those which aid pollen studies), and inter- pretation (e.g., systems for carrying out socioeconomic anal- ysis of settlements and cemeteries both internally and on the level of large-scale distributional analysis). The recent pro-</page><page sequence="8">236 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 liferation of adequate and easy-to-use expert system shells, combined with the simplicity of the underlying concepts, makes it reasonable to expect archaeologists to be capable of constructing highly portable domain-specific applications. This paper begins with a brief explanation of the basic concepts of expert systems and describes the process of building knowledge-based systems. This is followed by a short report on several promising archaeological applica- tions (one undertaken by the author and two by French spe- cialists). The paper concludes by arguing that in some areas expert system development will provide immediate avenues of research for archaeologists (classification and identifica- tion), but in other fields the influence of expert systems will be more long range (interpretation and explanation). Areas where knowledge is already well-defined and organized will benefit first. In general, knowledge-based system develop- ment work in archaeology will emphasize further the need for coherent theory, require a higher standard of argument and presentation of knowledge, and offer a better under- standing of the manner in which archaeologists organize and interpret information. AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE KRITIOS BOY: Jeffrey M. Hurwit, University of Oregon Although the Kritios Boy (Acropolis Museum 698) is one of the most familiar of all Greek statues and figures promi- nently (and properly) in most discussions of the transforma- tion of freestanding sculpture that occurred in the first quar- ter of the fifth century B.C., the statue has long been subject to a number of misconceptions and untested assumptions. Something as basic as the height of the statue, for instance, is almost without exception reported erroneously, even in offi- cial catalogues of the Acropolis collections (for the record, the preserved height is 1.17 m., not 0.86 m.). And while there is no dispute that the head of the figure was found in 1888, the year of the discovery of the torso is variously given as 1864 (J.A. Bundgaard, The Excavation of the Athenian Acropolis [Copenhagen 1974] 9 and 29 n. 1), 1865 (G. Dick- ins, Catalogue of the Acropolis Museum [Cambridge 1912] 264), and 1865/1866 (H. Schrader ed., Die archaischen Marmorbildwerke der Akropolis [Frankfurt am Main 1939] 191). The findspot of the torso is often misidentified as well, and so is its archaeological context. The confusion on these last counts is largely due to the existence of an old photo- graph that shows the torso of the Kritios Boy in the hap- hazard company of the Moschophoros, the head of Athena from the east pediment of the Archaios Naos, and Angeli- tos's Athena, three works that were certainly found together in 1864. It is as if all four sculptures had just been lifted out of the same trench (see Schrader 345, fig. 405). The photograph, now in a private collection in Boston, has in fact been used to argue that the torso of the Kritios Boy was found at the same time and the same place as the two Athenas and the Moschophoros, with the implications that the Kritios Boy's archaeological context was mixed (Angelitos's dedication is possibly early Classical) and that the statue could therefore be post-Persian (see B.S. Ridg- way, The Severe Style [Princeton 1970] 31). This paper es- tablishes that the torso of the statue was in reality discovered early in 1866 (two years later than the Moschophoros et al.) with a completely different (though still archaeologically mixed) set of sculptures, including the mid-fifth century head Acropolis 699-which also happens to have rested (awkwardly) upon the shoulders of the Kritios Boy from 1880 until the discovery of the correct head in 1888. There are, it is argued, no good archaeological grounds for a pre- Persian dating for the Kritios Boy, but the old photograph turns out to be less important as an archaeological document than as an elaborately posed, contrived, and even witty ex- ample of the new art form of photography in 19th-century Greece. EARLY STUDIES OF SICILIAN DORIC ARCHITECTURE: AN 18TH-CENTURY VIEW: Claire L. Lyons, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities An unpublished letter of the architect Jean-Baptiste Rondelet, conserved in the Getty Center's Archives of the History of Art, chronicles a voyage made by its author in 1784 to various sites in South Italy and Sicily. In the corre- spondence with his patron, Rondelet describes the Doric temples at Paestum, Segesta, Selinus, and Agrigento, where he made measured plans and elevations, and recorded de- tailed observations on construction techniques and building materials. Whereas the few earlier publications of Sicilian temples provided panoramic views of the ancient monu- ments in dramatic natural settings, Rondelet's research stands out as one of the first architectural studies of Western Greek Doric based on scientific principles of design and en- gineering, rather than on style and Vitruvian preconcep- tions. Although not mentioned in the literature on early travelers in Italy, the travels of Rondelet in Sicily at a time when few visitors ventured beyond the vicinity of Naples are especially interesting for the subsequent role which the Sicilian experience played in the French architect's career. The studies of Rondelet and other architects at the French Academy, carried out in the period when archaeo- logical excavations had begun to attract the attention of Eu- ropean scholars, established the rationalist approach to the study of Greek architecture, which focused on the effect of building techniques, materials, and function on form and style. Publication of the Western Greek temples had a strong influence on the interpretation of the Doric order on the Mainland, where temples such as the Parthenon were better known for their sculptures than for the building they decorated. This paper discusses the historiography of West- ern Greek temple architecture in the 18th century and the role of Rondelet in the development of modern criteria for the documentation of ancient architecture. SESSION II C: COLLOQUIUM: ATTIC VASE PAINTING-PHINTIAS WITH PHINTIAS: Michael M. Eisman, Temple Uni- versity</page><page sequence="9">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 237 As a prelude to the discussion of Phintias's painting, this paper explores what we know about him as a technos, and the artistic and economic conditions under which he worked. The primary evidence comes from the graffiti on vases at- tributed to him and from dipinti on vases assigned to him in one way or another. The use of "trademark" graffiti as well as the general shape of vases attributed to Phintias suggests that he and probably the entire Pioneer Group represent the red-figure painters in the large "Leagros Workshop." In this light Phintias and his companions can be paralleled by the Ando- kides Painter and Psiax in the Andokides Workshop, and the Nikosthenes Painter and Oltos in the Nikosthenic Workshop. Based on trademark associations we can note that there was heavy trade in the Sicilian market with less emphasis on local and Italian sales. The vases signed by Phintias (six egrapsen and three epoiesen) present some interesting and as yet unsolved prob- lems. I do not take it as at all certain that we can recognize the "signature" of Phintias himself. Vases with his name give four different forms: 1) Phintias (the most common), 2) Phintian (which I take as Phintias written by a different hand), 3) Phitias (a rushed misspelling), and 4) Philtias (the Attic form of Phintias). These forms suggest that Phintias was a Western Greek who migrated to Athens and, on the negative side, throw some doubt on who painted the signatures. The epoiesen dipinti raise questions about the meaning of epoiesen (see JHS 94 [1974] 172). The evidence suggests that the term may have multiple meanings, although it is still unlikely that Phintias himself was a potter. The famous "as never Euphronios" dipinto suggests that there was good- natured camaraderie within the workshop, and the variety of signatures suggests a large cooperative venture in which technikes who did not wish to work for someone else com- bined so that they might be competitive with the other large workshops of Athens. If this is so, we can note the higher degree of individuality and camaraderie in the Leagran workshop. THE ICONOGRAPHY OF PHINTIAS: Thomas H. Car- penter, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Euphronios, Phintias, and Euthymides were, as Beazley wrote, "pioneers of the new drawing," and the impact of their work can be observed not only on other red-figure vases, but also on contemporary black-figure vases-partic- ularly those of the Leagros Group, which, again according to Beazley, were "produced in the same workshop or work- shops" as were those of the Pioneers. The "new drawing" of the Pioneers is paralleled by inno- vations in iconography, both in subject and in detail, many of which became common in later red-figure painting, but these innovations on the small group of vases from the hands of the Pioneers are quite noticeably absent from the huge group of Leagran vases. For example, the thyrsos, which newly appears in Dionysian scenes on Pioneer vases and be- comes canonical in later red-figure, does not appear on vases from the Leagros Group, nor does the balding Satyr, a fa- vorite of Phintias and ubiquitous later. So too, the explicit eroticism of some Pioneer vases is absent from those of the Leagros Group. This new iconography, its absence from contemporary black-figure vases, and the comparatively small output of the Pioneers all raise questions about different markets at which these black- and red-figure vases may have been aimed, but more importantly, they hint at a different and perhaps expanded role these new painters may have played in the arts in Athens. Scenes on several of Phintias's vases clearly illustrate the changes in iconography and may point toward answers for the larger questions. THE STYLE OF PHINTIAS: Jenifer Neils, Case Western Reserve University Taking the seven signed vases as a point of departure, it is possible to reconstruct the artistic career of the Pioneer red- figure painter Phintias. Beginning with his earliest signed cup in Munich and proceeding to his latest vases, one can establish four stylistic phases within his extant oeuvre. Al- though better known as a pot painter, Phintias in recent years has emerged as an innovative decorator of cups. Hence, we are now better able to assess his relationship to various unattributed kylixes of the Pioneer Group, includ- ing the Gorgos cup in the Agora. Consideration is also given in this paper to Phintias's stylistic relationships with other Pioneers, contemporary black-figure painters, possible fol- lowers, and Archaic relief sculpture. SESSION II D: COLLOQUIUM: ARCHAEOLO- GY IN ANATOLIA I: PRE-CLASSICAL SITES NEW EVIDENCE ON THE PREHISTORY OF NORTHWEST- ERN TURKEY: Mehmet Ozdokan, Istanbul Univer- sity The northwestern part of Turkey, viz., the region around the Sea of Marmara and eastern parts of Thrace, is critically located at the meeting point of three culturally and geo- graphically distinct zones: Anatolia, the Aegean, and the Balkans. Although there was for a long time almost no ar- chaeological documentation in this contact zone, it always seemed evident that the region was crucial for the under- standing of the relationship between prehistoric Europe and the Near East. A large-scale research program was under- taken by the University of Istanbul, in the hope of determin- ing the cultural sequence of the region, and thus working toward firmer linkages between prehistoric Europe, the Near East, and the Aegean. Since the beginning of the proj- ect, some 400 prehistoric sites, yielding a vast spectrum of new material from Early Palaeolithic to the Iron Age, have been recovered; two rescue excavations were also conducted. One of the most striking results of the survey is the differ- ence of the cultural assemblages recovered on either side of</page><page sequence="10">238 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 the Sea of Marmara. The particular geomorphological structure of the region, leading to rather recent changes in the environmental conditions of the Sea of Marmara, seems to have had some impact on the cultural happenings in the region. Among other issues to be discussed is new evidence for the early beginnings of food-producing communities in the re- gion, the distribution of some Troadic cultures, and the sig- nificance of "megalithic" cultures. Rescue excavations conducted in the cave of Yarimbur- gaz, some 30 km. west of the Bosporus, have revealed new and rather unexpected data. The upper horizons of the cave have yielded a stratified sequence of fine decorated pottery, bearing some characteristic features of different Neolithic cultures of southeastern Europe, but as a whole a unique assemblage hitherto unknown elsewhere. The underlying series of Pleistocene layers, some with archaeological mate- rial, are indicative of major changes in the environmental conditions of the region. At the bottom of this sequence some habitation layers were recovered, yielding a fair amount of pebble tools and very coarse flakes. It seems possible that the lower horizon of the Yarimburgaz cave represents the ear- liest traces of human occupation outside Africa. HATTUSHA, CITY OF GODS AND TEMPLES: Peter Neve, Deutsches Archdiologisches Institut, Bogazk6y Ex- cavations For the last nine years the excavations of the German Ar- chaeological Institute at Bogazk6y have concentrated on the Upper City, the southern part of the Hittite capital. This area, covering more than 1,000,000 m.2, was only generally known through investigations conducted first by Otto Puch- stein and his team in 1907, with such landmarks as Yenice- kale and Sarikale, ruins on steep rock formations, the re- mains of four temples (Temples 2-5), and the city wall with its gateways and their sculptures. Excavations are now being conducted on a large scale to investigate both the city wall and the city itself. The present state of the evidence suggests that the entire Upper City was a sacred city, consisting of numerous temples and sanctu- aries, founded by Great King Tuthaliya IV (ca. 1250-1220 B.C.), the same king who enlarged the royal palace of the citadel Buikiikkale and arranged the famous rock sanctuary of Yazilikaya outside the capital in its final state. So far 30 more or less well-preserved temples and sanctu- aries have been unearthed in the Upper City. They are simi- lar in plan, but differ in size and quality. The largest one, Temple 5, proved to be a temple-palace connected with a large sacred precinct which contained three small chapels probably erected in honor of the royal ancestors of Tuthali- ya IV. Furthermore, Temple 5 marks the beginning of a proces- sional road leading outside the city wall directly to the pyra- mid-like bastion of the Sphinx Gate, which, set at the high- est point of the Hittite capital and flanked by symmetrically designed walls, embankments and stairways, must have been the sacred center of this road. The Sphinx Gate area also yielded a bronze cuneiform tablet bearing a treaty between the Great King Tuthaliya IV and King Kurunta of Tarhuntasha. Together with other documents from the newly reexcavated Temples 2 and 3, this text reveals new aspects of late Hittite history bearing upon the decline and fall of the Hittite Empire. PHRYGIAN ANKARA AND ITS TUMULI: Sevim Buluq, Middle East Technical University Ankara, Ancyra of the Classical era, was an important city from the Phrygian period on. Archaeological excava- tions so far have not provided sufficient evidence to deter- mine the exact location and structure of the Phrygian city. This city, however, may not be far from the 20 Phrygian royal tombs represented in tumuli found within the confines of modern Ankara itself. In the last decade of the 19th cen- tury these tumuli were noticed by travelers as well as ar- chaeologists. Various excavations of individual tumuli were undertaken in subsequent years, not all of them recorded, and several not published in detail. Three tumuli were excavated by the Middle East Tech- nical University, under the direction of Prof. Ekrem Akur- gal. The results of this work, completed in 1968-1969, are presented. A new interpretation of the Ankara tumuli as a group is proposed, in the light of new results obtained dur- ing an excavation of a tumulus in the summer of 1987.

THE NORTHERN "FRONTIER" OF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST: TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA COM- PARED: Philip L. Kohl, Wellesley College</page><page sequence="11">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 239 This paper briefly reviews the material culture of two areas, Transcaucasia and Soviet Central Asia (or, more broadly, Western Turkesten), from the Neolithic through Bronze Age periods. It compares and contrasts the environ- mental settings of these two areas and the cultural sequences assembled for them primarily by Soviet archaeologists. Both areas are viewed as "frontiers"-not "peripheries"-to the ancient Near East in the sense that during the time period of concern both Transcaucasia and Central Asia were neither politically nor economically dependent upon the high river- ine civilizations to the south with which they were in con- tact: Mesopotamia for Transcaucasia; and the Indo-Iranian borderlands and the Indus Valley for Soviet Central Asia. Both areas were creative centers in their own right, appar- ently expanding southward at specific points in time and fostering advances in metallurgy and means of transporta- tion associated with the domestication of the horse. A major thesis of the paper is that both areas-possibly for different reasons and under different conditions-experienced sig- nificant shifts in settlement patterns and ways of life at the end of the third and beginning of the second millennium B.C. These changes, clearly associated with the "second plant and animal revolution," ushered in new forms of adaptation that to a certain extent continued to characterize both areas well into the historic period. OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS OF EARLY STATE FORMA- TION IN ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA: Harvey Weiss, Yale University Three major problems of early state formation in ancient Mesopotamia await resolution: 1) the transformation of late Ubaid villages into late Uruk period states in southern Me- sopotamia in the period between ca. 4000 and 3500 B.C.; 2) the temporal gap between the late Uruk period, southern Mesopotamian colonies in northern Mesopotamia, Syria, Anatolia, and Iran, and the appearance of the first states in northern Mesopotamia, between 3300 and ca. 2500 B.C.; 3) the processes behind the appearance of the first states in northern Mesopotamia at ca. 2500 B.C. There is an abundance of explanatory frameworks which might be deployed to analyze these problems. Lacking are the precise and credible historical conditions which gener- ated and accompanied these processes and situations. The contrastive correlates of dry-farming and irrigation agricul- ture production, transport, and reproduction functions rein- force the impression that we have yet to define period-spe- cific values for basic social and economic variables. WORKSHOP: TELL LEILAN 1987 THE SECOND MILLENNIUM PALACE AND ITS ARCHIVE: Harvey Weiss, Yale University In September and October 1987 the Yale University Tell Leilan Project recovered an additional 700 m.2 of the Lower Town palace of which 200 m.2 were excavated in 1985. The excavated sample of this building now includes two baked- brick paved courtyards, measuring 175 and 270 m.2, and 21 rooms. The stratigraphic and architectural data, analyzed by Peter Akkermans, University of Amsterdam, suggest that the palace underwent three stages of rebuilding. In addition to two rooms excavated in 1985 which contained some cu- neiform archival materials, the 1987 excavations provided two rooms which contained approximately 1100 epigraphic objects: more than 200 inscribed seal impressions, more than 25 inscribed envelope fragments, and more than 800 tablets of which more than 550 are complete. A preliminary exami- nation of almost half the complete tablets by Jesper Eidem, University of Copenhagen, reveals that more than one-third are royal letters. A preliminary examination of the seal im- pressions by Dominique Parayre, University of Paris, indi- cates that approximately 100 are of the "Old Babylonian" style and about 25 of the "Old Syrian" style. The 1982 Acropolis Temple and 1985 Acropolis Build- ing Level X excavations at Tell Leilan generated the tablet and seal impression data with which it was possible to iden- tify conclusively Tell Leilan as both ancient Shubat Enlil and Shekhna, capital of the land of Apum. The names of the resident kings within the Lower Town Palace archive and the year names recorded on administrative texts within the archive suggest that the archive is the first epigraphic docu- mentation for the period 1739-1726 B.C. in northern Me- sopotamia. The topographic situation of the Palace within the Tell Leilan Lower Town suggests that more than 75% of the palace remains to be retrieved and that the palace may be as large as the "Palace of Zimri-Lim" at Mari. SESSION III A: JOINT SESSION OF THE AMERICAN PHILOLOGICAL ASSOCIA- TION AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTI- TUTE OF AMERICA PEISISTRATOS AND THE UNIFICATION OF ATTICA: Frank Frost, University of California, Santa Bar- bara The younger Perikles, responding to Sokrates, contrasted the unanimity of the Athenians with Boiotian resentment of selfish and grasping Theban leadership (Xen. Mem. 3.5.2). The question why the polis of the Athenians had developed in a more harmonious way was neither raised nor answered but it is a good question, one that this paper seeks to answer, at least in part. The synoikismos of Attica was attributed to Theseus according to Athenian tradition. But the stories of the disunity prevailing before the synoikismos reflect an ac- tual situation that existed perhaps as late as the eighth cen- tury; the annexation of Eleusis, also attributed to Theseus, probably did not occur until the later seventh century. Why then did old and distinguished enclaves like Thorikos or the Marathonian tetrapolis not resist the domination of the Athenian asty more vigorously? It is the thesis of this paper that the true unification of Attica took place during the rule of Peisistratos and that it was made possible by persuading the demes and cult centers</page><page sequence="12">240 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 of the countryside that, although law and leadership were centralized in the asty, they derived their authority from every district of Attica and not just from a handful of noble families in the asty. Before Peisistratos, rivalry for power and honor was between the followers of Lykourgos and those of Megakles, both from the region of the city. It is doubtful that the concept of an Athenian state at that time had penetrated the eastern half of Attica much beyond Pen- telikon and Hymettos. But Peisistratos drew his strength from the countryside and after his final return his goal was a reconciliation of asty and the country demes. There were both political and economic factors in this reconciliation; this paper focuses on Peisistratos's religious initiatives. The number and diversity of cult centers in the Attic countryside was demonstrated long ago by Solders (Ausserstadtischen Kulte [1931]) and archaeological survey and excavation have since expanded our knowledge. The families who held the hereditary priesthoods of these cults can be seen as equivalent to a network of local governments in rural Attica. When Peisistratos initiated a policy of honoring rural cults by building new cult centers in downtown Athens, he was demonstrating the interdependence of asty and countryside in what was the most meaningful way for the sixth century. An Eleusinion was constructed in the Agora (Travlos 198); Brauronian Artemis was celebrated on the Acropolis (L. Kahil, Hesperia 50 [1981] 253ff.); a cult of Athena was brought from Paiania (probably the meaning of Hdt. 1.60). But it was Dionysos who was most honored by Peisistratos, possibly because the god played such a central role in his Orphic beliefs (M. West, Orphic Poems, 15ff., 249ff.). Both Ikarian and Eleutherean Dionysos found new homes on the slopes of the Acropolis, adding a city Dionysia to the rural festival; the festivals were amplified by tragic performances before 536/535 (Mar. Par. A 43; in general, F. Kolb, Jdl 92 [1977] 124-33). By making powerful priestly families in the rural demes his clients, Peisistratos was creating an Attica-wide struc- ture of authority in which the heavy hand of his tyranny was virtually invisible, as all our sources suggest. That the cults were effective in enforcing Peisistratid authority seems dem- onstrated by the lengths to which Kleisthenes went to neu- tralize and isolate them in his new tribal system, as D.M. Lewis has shown (Historia 1963, 30-35). ELEUSIS AND ATHENS: THE CITY AND ITS Two GOD- DESSES: Kevin Clinton, Cornell University The Homeric Hymn to Demeter, probably not composed for an Attic audience, shows, by the absence of any reference to Athens, that the fame of the Mysteries at the end of the seventh century was independent of Athens, despite the fact that Eleusis was not politically independent. A century later, we find the cult and the polis inextricably linked, and the polis profiting from the cult's Panhellenic popularity. The popularity is reflected in the excavated remains, which show successively larger Telesteria and peribolos walls. Athenianization of the Mysteries was helped by associating with them a cult close to the center of Athens (at Agrai), now called the Lesser Mysteries, and by the creation of a sister sanctuary below the Acropolis, the Eleusinion. The process of centralization must have begun early. Centralization, however, did not occur without tension. Two gene, the Eumolpidai and the Kerykes, controlled most of the priesthoods, which were held for life, and the incum- bents would naturally become well known. The custom of spondophoria allowed the priests to deal directly with other Greek cities. The political use of trials concerning the pro- fanation of the Mysteries earned the gene friends but also bitter opponents. A reflection of bad feeling inspired by the Eumolpidai in some circles is perhaps to be seen in the myth that puts Eumolpus in command of a Thracian army attack- ing Athens. The Mysteries are linked to such great moments of Athenian history as the victory over the Persians at Salamis. And not long afterwards, the city began to build a much grander Telesterion, finally brought to completion under Pericles, probably at the same time as the Parthenon. This high point is reflected in a decree in which the Athenians call upon not only their allies but all Greek cities to contri- bute First Fruits of grain. The end of the 420s marks a reversal in the goddesses' fortunes, however, and the First Fruits decline to only a few drachmas. In 420, when Ascle- pius was introduced to the City for the first time, he was led straight to the Eleusinion, and his subsequent incorporation into the Mysteries was no doubt intended as a help to the Two Goddesses. A new fragment of the Late Fifth-Century Law Code gives us a fresh perspective on this interesting episode, involving the Eleusinian priests, Sophocles, offi- cials at Epidauros, and the enterprising Telemachos of Acharnae. DIONYSOS: Albert Henrichs, Harvard University The abstract for this paper was unavailable for publica- tion. ASPECTS OF CULT IN CLASSICAL ATHENS: John Board- man, Ashmolean Museum Two aspects of Classical cult are explored, both involving innovations in the treatment of familiar deities. The first is the worship of the Twelve Gods, a cult in which Athens had been prominent through the dedication of an altar to them in 522/521 B.C. Their identity is taken to be broadly "Olym- pian" even if their exact composition at that date is not known. In Periclean Athens this literary rather than ritual- inspired attitude to them was heavily exploited, especially on the Parthenon whose eastern aspect contains no less than four groups of them as a family. Their altar had been the most prominent of the long derelict but attended monuments in Athens after the Persian War, and its rebuilding late in the century might reflect the special role now given them by an Athens which regarded itself as leader of Greece and the Greeks.</page><page sequence="13">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 241 The second aspect concerns the cult of Herakles/Pan- krates/Palaimon, identified by excavation in Athens. Pan- krates, shown as a Herakles but also as a large head emerg- ing from the ground, has elements of an Earth-born giant, and appears as a Giant fought by Herakles in the sixth cen- tury. Herakles and Palaimon seem celebrated by a new story about them, figured on vases (where Plouton is usually seen rather than Palaimon). The apparently new cult and accompanying aition demonstrate the vigor with which in heroic, as in Olympian, cult Classical Athens could refur- bish its traditional religious practices. SESSION III B: BRONZE AGE THE GREVENA PROJECT, 1987: Nancy C. Wilkie, Carleton College The Grevena Project, sponsored jointly by Carleton Col- lege and the Center for Ancient Studies, University of Min- nesota, recently completed its first field season. Although the focus of our work is an interdisciplinary study of the entire nomos of Grevena, Southwest Macedonia, the archaeologi- cal survey is confined to the northwestern part of the nomos. Prior to our work little was known about the archaeo- logical potential of the area. Only scattered surface remains and a few burials were reported. Because much of the pre- historic pottery is local in character (see Romiopoulou, BSA 66 [1971] 353-62) and no stratified deposits have been excavated, dating of the surface remains has been difficult. Nonetheless, preliminary study indicates that sites of the Early Neolithic, Late Mycenaean, Early Iron Age, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Turkish periods can be identified. Geomorphological studies by M. Savina have revealed that large parts of the survey area have suffered from ero- sion. In many cases thin layers of sherds appear in the collu- vium on the steep slopes offering little hope for in situ depos- its on the hilltops. Geophysical surveys in the coming years, however, should aid in identifying the extent of this prob- lem. Recent changes in agricultural practices also have re- shaped the landscape considerably and they will be studied by S. Aschenbrenner. Study of the historical ecology of the region by O. Rackham and J. Moody will attempt to recon- struct past vegetation and physical environments while de- termining the impact of man's activities on them. In the course of their work, several potential sites for pollen coring were identified and samples were taken for further study. A study of the history of modern settlement and popu- lation distribution patterns, focusing on both current and abandoned villages, has been undertaken by M. Clark. One of the aims of this study is the determination of the re- sources, both natural and human, involved in the construc- tion and maintenance of local communities. Finally, a study of herding practices has been initiated by H. Koster. Wace and Thompson's classic study, Nomads of the Balkans, fo- cused on one type of herding practices in the nomos, i.e., long-distance transhumant pastoralism, yet other patterns have now been recognized that are of equal if not greater importance to the economic and social structure of the region. REGIONAL PREHISTORIC RESEARCH IN WEST MACE- DONIA, GREECE: THE FIRST SEASON: Michael Fotia- dis, Boston University Kitrini Limni (elevation 656-670 masl) is a former lake bottom, ca. 25 km. 2 in area, at the southern end of the basin of Ptolemaida, West Macedonia, Greece. Within and around the former lake 13 prehistoric sites are known, dat- able, on the basis of surface material, from the sixth to the third millennium B.C. The sites are all low, extensive mounds, rising up to 6 m. above their surroundings; the smallest occupies ca. 3 ha., the largest exceeds 10 ha. Some of the sites are threatened by the projected expansion of the lignite strip mines in the basin, and all are currently de- graded by deep plowing. In view of these circumstances, the Greek Archaeological Service initiated in the summer of 1987 a long-term project for the exploration of aspects of the region's prehistory. I report in this paper on the objectives and results of the season's fieldwork. The 1987 operations included the collection of back- ground information about the landscape of Kitrini Limni and its transformation in recent decades; systematic surface survey in two of the 13 sites, Nisi Pontokomis and Megalo Nisi Galanis; and a trial excavation at the latter site. At Megalo Nisi Galanis (occupied in the Middle and Late Neolithic and in the Early Bronze Age) it became pos- sible to investigate the effects of the fluctuating former lake and of recent deep plowing on the prehistoric deposits. The distribution of surface material was mapped, and its peri- meter determined. Excavation along the perimeter showed a close correspondence between the extents of surface material and subsurface deposits, and indicated that the settlement occupied an eroded surface of clay marl (today completely covered by recent lacustrine sediments). The formation of the lake postdates settlement at the site. Large samples of ground and chipped stone materials (tools, blanks, waste) were obtained from the survey and the excavation. They demonstrate local workmanship of a wide range of rocks (including obsidian). Preliminary matching with sources indicates that most materials originated in the mountains around the basin of Ptolemaida. The possible ex- ceptions to that pattern raise intricate questions. EXCAVATIONS AT PALAIKASTRO: J.A. MacGillivray, British School at Athens The excavations of the British School at Athens at Palai- kastro were resumed under the direction of L.H. Sackett and J.A. MacGillivray. Two six-week campaigns were completed in 1986 and 1987. Both were sponsored by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory, the British School at Athens, and the William and Mary Greve Foundation.</page><page sequence="14">242 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 Previous work on the site in 1902-1906 and 1962-1963 exposed parts of a large town with associated peak sanctuary, refuge settlement, burial grounds, and outlying habitations. The purpose of the new excavations is to locate the cen- tral building or administrative center of the Minoan town and to gather information about diet and local environmen- tal conditions. The area chosen was the fields north of the previously exposed town at Roussolakkos. Surface indica- tions and magnetic survey in 1983 had shown this area to contain coherent structures which included gypsum blocks and sandstone horns of consecration. The new excavation revealed four architectural units, which are temporarily called Buildings 1 to 4. The history of the buildings is as follows: Buildings 1 and 3 appear to have been built during LM IA and overlie traces of an ear- lier structure destroyed early in LM IA. Building 1 was faced with finely cut ashlar masonry on all four sides, and had a platform adorned with stone horns of consecration added during the LM I period. The corridor between the two buildings was partially paved with slabs covering a large, stone-built drain, presumably designed to evacuate rain water from an open area as yet undiscovered. The drain opens out into a walled passage leading from the buildings toward the sea. These buildings suffered a destruction by fire at the end of LM IB. The traces of this event come from outside the walls of Building 1 on the north side, from an area of mudbrick storerooms west of Building 3 where two pithoi and a few fine LM IB vases and chisels were found, and from an open area adjacent to 1 and 3 where the torso and arms of a superb ivory statuette with gold foil adhering and LM IB pottery had fallen under a collapse of building debris. The statuette is of a male figure in the same pose as the terracotta statuettes from nearby Petsophas and may represent the Minoan youthful God. Both buildings were reoccupied soon after the destruction, early in the LM IIIA period. Destruction deposits of the LM IIIA2/B1 period were cleared on the south side of Building 3 and in a small room in Building 4, which seems to have been erected at the west end of Building 1 during this period. There are ca. five successive LM IIIB floors in Building 1 and new walls were added both inside and outside the building during this peri- od. The latest material from the building comes from a small paved area with a bench at one side and comprises two LM IIIB2 coarse-ware stirrup jars from central Crete, two deep bowls also imported, conical cups found in inverted position, and seashells. Fragments of terracotta figurines, including the head of a Minoan goddess with upraised arms, and horns of consecration, suggest that part of the reoccupation, at least, was of a religious nature. EXCAVATIONS AT PSEIRA, 1987: Philip P. Betancourt, Temple University, and Costis Davaras, Archaeo- logical Institute of Crete Excavations were conducted at the Minoan site of Pseira, Crete, for four weeks in July and early August 1987 under the direction of Philip Betancourt and Costis Davaras. Ex- cavation concentrated on the area of the plateia, a large open court near the center of the town. Partial clearing of the court's western side showed that it was not rectangular, as setbacks in the buildings fronting on it created an irregular facade. Several rooms of a house at the plateia's northeast corner were excavated. The building had a paved vestibule, benches, and a well-built stone staircase. Pottery on the floors indicated a destruction in LM IB. Other finds includ- ed loom weights, waste pieces from stone vase manufacture, and a monumental stone lamp, one of the largest known from Minoan Crete. Fallen slabs from the second story showed that the upper floor had a paved floor with slabs over a meter in length. Finds from other LM I levels in the town contributed new evidence for foreign relations, includ- ing imported pottery from Cyprus and the Levant. At the edge of the town, the LM III house discovered in 1986 was cleared, revealing a new house type for this period in Crete. AYIA IRINI, KEOS: A TERMINAL REPORT: Elizabeth Schofield, University of Cincinnati Excavations on Keos, initiated by the University of Cin- cinnati in 1960, ended a decade ago. Annual study seasons have taken a group of scholars to the island each summer until 1987, when fieldwork was concluded. After 27 years, the Ayia Irini project has terminated. Recent work has focused particularly on architectural, stratigraphic, ceramic, and contextual study of all areas of the site in its major phases. The sequence of development throughout the Early and Middle Bronze Ages is well docu- mented, and has been published in part. The architectural evolution and history of the Late Bronze Age town is more complex than the picture presented in preliminary reports and differs from it in significant details; most notably, there was no gap in occupation after the Late Cycladic II "great earthquake," and the late Cycladic IIIA settlement was more extensive and important and lasted longer than previ- ously supposed. Special studies of certain classes of finds have included the wall paintings. Though very fragmentary, they have yielded to detailed analysis. It has now proved possible to reconstruct passages from the important miniature frescoes from the Northeast Bastion, and to view the Blue Bird fresco as decorating three walls of House A Room 31. These studies and discoveries, and others, will occupy the remaining dozen or more volumes in the Keos series, to be added over the next decade to the six which have already appeared. THE 1987 EXCAVATIONS AT KAVOUSI, CRETE: Wil- liam D.E. Coulson, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Geraldine C. Gesell, University of Tennessee, and Leslie P. Day, Wabash College Excavations at Kavousi took place in 1987 both at the lower site on Vronda and at the upper settlement on the Kastro. On Vronda, the objectives were to, identify the boun- daries of the settlement and its extent, to explore anomalies that were identified during the 1986 geophysical survey, and to recover more information on Dark Age burial practices.</page><page sequence="15">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 243 Trenches dug on the west side of the hill revealed the geo- morphology of the area, including a well-preserved pottery kiln of LM IIIC date. Portions of houses uncovered along the western side of the site were found to contain Late Geo- metric cist graves; in two of these, layers of cremations and inhumations had been deposited along with bronze and iron grave goods. It appears, therefore, that after the settlement had been abandoned sometime in the Protogeometric period, it was used as a cemetery in Late Geometric times. In the southwestern part of the settlement, to the south of a build- ing with massive walls, was uncovered a deposit of smashed cult equipment, including snake tubes and at least five fig- urines of goddesses with upraised arms. Work on the Kastro concentrated on clarifying the archi- tecture of previously excavated rooms and on opening new areas in an attempt to determine the extent of the settlement, its stratigraphy, and its relationship to Vronda. Trenches opened in the west and east revealed good stratified deposits with associated architecture of Middle to Late Geometric date. Of particular importance has been the discovery of a portion of a bench, possibly part of a shrine, on which were found a number of human figurines, presumably ex votos. To date, nothing earlier than Middle Geometric has been found on the Kastro, but the depth of deposit on the east provides the possibility for uncovering earlier material of similar date to that of Vronda. EXCAVATIONS AT THE COMPLEX SITE OF NURAGHE SANTA BARBARA, BAULADU: Lenore Gallin, Univer- sity of California, Los Angeles The University of California, in conjunction with the Italian Region of Sardinia, began the excavation of the mon- umental stone complex of Nuraghe Santa Barbara at Baula- du in 1986. Exploration of this exemplary site reveals con- tinuous occupation, periodic architectural elaboration, and fortification during the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age. The nuraghe consists of a central tower at least two stories high, with an intact dome rising 8 m. over the first-floor cen- tral chamber. (The difficulty of accurately measuring Nu- ragic domes was overcome during the 1986 season with the use of a specially adapted laser.) Attached to the bulwark are four subsidiary towers connected by a curtain wall and enclosing a courtyard in front of the main tower. Surround- ing the Nuragic bastion are remains of a large village which in turn is enclosed by a megalithic wall 500 m. in circumfer- ence with two additional towers built into its northern side. Absolute dating of the architectural phases of this site offers a temporal backdrop to the evolution of Nuragic settlements which is currently lacking. Preliminary excavations in the western section of the village suggest a tentative chronology: 1) recent agrarian and Mediaeval; 2) Punic-Roman and Roman-Republican, sixth-century B.C.-first century A.C.; 3) Nuragic collapse; and 4) Nuragic occupation, ca. 12th- ninth centuries B.C. Analysis of cultural material from the village suggests the communal nature of dwellings, fronting on a paved courtyard, and identified what may have been artisans' quarters. Interesting parallels with contemporary Nuragic villages in other parts of the island have been noted. JURISDICTION OVER LANDED PROPERTY IN DEIR EL- MEDINEH (EGYPT): Andrea G. McDowell, Rijks- universiteit, Leiden The royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings were cut and decorated by a gang of craftsmen permanently assigned to this task. These craftsmen lived in their own walled village in a small desert valley now known as Deir el-Medineh, a site unique in Egypt for its combination of extensive mate- rial and textual remains. Each workman was allocated a group of four buildings, including a house in the village, a hut near the Valley of the Kings, a grave, and a funerary chapel. In some cases, the ruins of a particular house can still be identified with an original inhabitant well known to us from the texts. These buildings were assigned to the workmen by the crown and remained state property under state control. As such, they, and perhaps by extension all real estate, appear to have formed a special legal category, a feature of the village legal system which has not been point- ed out before. It is noteworthy that not a single dispute about rights to landed property in Deir el-Medineh is heard by the local court, which was made up of members of the work crew. The legal status of immovable property in the work- men's village may be comparable to that of arable land else- where: the latter seems to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the office of the vizier rather than local officials, and in Deir el-Medineh we do in fact find that representatives of the vizier's office were called in when problems about build- ings arose. But it would hardly have been practicable for every squabble about a hut to be referred to the vizier. For this there was evidently a neat solution: disputes about property ownership could be submitted to the oracle of the deified Pharaoh Amenophis I, an ideal representative of the state. The local officials naturally did all the background work and executed the god's instructions; and if it is true that the oracle operated by auto-suggestion, then the god may in effect have done little more than ratify a decision already made by the locals. But the principle of state control was upheld. OLD BABYLONIAN HOUSE FORM AND CULTURE: Charles Pennington, Boston University If, as has been argued, the physical form of a house is determined primarily by cultural factors (A. Rapoport, House Form and Culture [New York 1969]), then we should be able to analyze the arrangement of space within the house in terms of these various cultural concepts. Rapoport identi- fies five factors that contribute to the concept of the house and determine house form. Three of these factors, the posi- tion of women in the society, the idea of privacy, and the degree of social intercourse, deal specifically with the place- ment of cultural and physical boundaries. Excavated remains of domestic architecture from Ur (areas AH and EM), Nippur (areas TA and TB), and other sites provide the physical evidence of boundaries. Bent axis entries, visibility of interior spaces, physical control of en- tries, the positioning of rooms, and the functional separation of space are observable clues that can indicate the separation</page><page sequence="16">244 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 of domains, public versus private, and male versus female, which allow this sort of explanatory study of house form. Supplementing the architectural study with ethnographic studies of the well-known Islamic attitude toward privacy and the seclusion of women, and examination of the ancient law codes and other texts give some further indication of the role of the house and privacy in Old Babylonian society. TELL EL-WAWIYAT EXCAVATION, ISRAEL: Beth Alpert Nakhai, Bonnie L. Wisthoff, and J.P. Dessel, Uni- versity of Arizona Excavations at Tell el-Wawiyat, on behalf of the Univer- sity of Arizona, in conjunction with the American Schools of Oriental Research, and the William F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, took place in 1986 and 1987. The excavation is codirected by Bonnie L. Wist- hoff, J.P. Dessel, and Beth Alpert Nakhai. William G. Dever is the project's Principal Investigator. Tell el-Wawiyat is a small mound, located in the Bet Netofah Valley in Israel's Lower Galilee. The objectives of the project are: 1) to investigate the Late Bronze Age-Iron Age I transitional horizon generally, and especially the question of cultural continuity and discontinuity; 2) to ex- amine urban-village relations in the Bet Netofah Valley by comparing Tell el-Wawiyat to the larger Tel Hannaton, and to smaller sites in the valley; and 3) to test the hypothe- sis that Tell el-Wawiyat was an early Israelite agricultural village, established in the Lower Galilee hinterland in the 12th century B.C., on a formerly Canaanite site. Small quantities of Middle Bronze Age IIA-IIC pottery have been found, along with two MB IIC infant jar burials, and fragments of walls at the base of a deep probe. Aside from several sherds, this was the earliest period in evidence at the site. The complete spectrum of Late Bionze Age I-Late Bronze Age II local and imported wares is attested, indi- cating the site's wealth throughout this period. Architectural continuity between Late Bronze II and the first phase of Iron Age I (12th century) occupation has been demon- strated. Evidence supplied by the two large buildings at Late Bronze II-Iron Age I Wawiyat, as well as by the wealth of ceramic finds, suggests that at this time the site fulfilled a specialized, possibly even religious, function. The second Iron Age I phase (11th century) represents a small squatter settlement. According to the biblical tradi- tion, this region fell under the control of the tribe of Zebu- lun. Its ancient name is unknown, although it may be re- flected in the Rimmon of the town lists of Joshua 19:13-14. After this occupational phase, the site went out of use. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the Tell el-Wa- wiyat excavation is contributing to the body of knowledge concerning Middle Bronze IA to Iron Age I village life in the relatively unexplored countryside of Israel's Lower Galilee. THE 1987 SEASON OF EXCAVATION AT KHIRBET IS- KANDER, JORDAN: Mary-Louise Mussell and Suzanne Richard, Drew University Work during the 1987 season at Khirbet Iskander was concentrated in the cemeteries, and Areas B and C. Excava- tion in the cemeteries confirmed the extensive nature of the EB IV burial grounds, as shaft tombs were identified on both sides of the Wadi Wala. For the first time, evidence of EB I occupation was found in the cemeteries. The remnants of an EB I charnel house were found on a slope to the north- east of the tell. Portions of two rooms, one containing pottery and the other skeletons, the heads of which had been placed in a row, have survived destruction by erosion. In Area C work continued on a gate-like structure, which had been identified in 1982. Further horizontal exposure served to confirm that this structure was indeed a pas- sageway to the upper city, during the latest phase of EB IV occupation. Further study of the unique EB IV fortification wall from the second phase of EB IV occupation and its asso- ciated structures was undertaken in Area B. It was deter- mined that not only did the perimeter wall possess a massive square tower or bastion with stairs, but that its builders made use of an earlier EB IV fortification wall to reinforce the new wall. The earlier wall had been capped by mud- brick which had toppled on to the associated structures. The two EB IV perimeter walls are predated by yet another phase of EB IV occupation, providing us with no less than four phases of EB IV. Beneath the earliest EB IV occupa- tion lies a substantial wall, which may be the perimeter wall of the EB I settlement. The extensive EB IV remains at Khirbet Iskander are forcing us to reevaluate this period which was once viewed as a "Dark Age" or a "Nomadic Interlude." At Khirbet Is- kander we have a multi-phased site which supported fortifi- cations during at least two of its phases. It becomes obvious, with only a cursory examination of the material from Khir- bet Iskander, that a reevaluation of the long-accepted theo- ries concerning the nature of the Early Bronze IV period (ca. 2350-2000 B.C.) is necessary. THE LATE BRONZE AGE SHIPWRECK AT ULU BURUN: 1987: Faith Hentschel, George Bass, and Cemal Pulak, Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas A&amp;M University The Institute of Nautical Archaeology completed its fourth excavation campaign at Ulu Burun, near Kay, Tur- key (G.F. Bass, AJA 90 [1986] 269-96; C. Pulak, AJA 92 [1988] 1-37). The ship carried a cargo of raw materials such as copper, tin, and glass in ingot form; logs of Egyptian ebony (Dalbergia melanoxylon); amphoras filled with Pista- cia terebinthus var. atlantica resin; and ivory in the form of a section of an elephant tusk and five hippopotamus teeth. Mycenaean pottery suggests the ship sank during the 14th century B.C., but no earlier than the time of Queen Neferti- ti, one of whose gold scarabs was found in the wreck. Seven distinct cultures are represented by artifacts on the wreck. Noteworthy finds in 1987 include an ostrich eggshell, two tortoise shells, a second pithos transporting Cypriot pottery, a third cylinder seal, Canaanite gold and silver jewelry, Ca-</page><page sequence="17">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 245 naanite weapons, and four more stone anchors (making a to- tal of 16). The site has now been mapped completely, to its deepest end (170 ft.). SESSION III C: ARCHAEOLOGY AND DEATH NEOLITHIC MORTUARY RITUAL AT FRANCHTHI CAVE, GREECE: Tracey Cullen, American Journal of Archaeology The human burials and scattered bones excavated in Neolithic levels at Franchthi Cave stand as a tenuous link to the symbolic and social world of the cave's inhabitants. The mortuary sample, too small to support generalization, nev- ertheless displays patterning that requires interpretation. The burials are examined in terms of 10 variables: location, date, grave form, type of interment (primary or secondary), orientation, position of the body, age, sex, grave goods, and associated features. Distinctions marked in death at Franch- thi are summarized and related to our current picture of Neolithic Greek society. Within the small sample, adults generally receive more attention (as marked materially) than children, and women more than men. The dead were apparently not segregated from the living: burial was intra- mural and human bone fragments were found scattered throughout habitation deposits at Franchthi. Bone scatter in Neolithic Greek contexts has been interpreted as evidence of disrespect or apathy toward the dead. Interpretations that relate the scatter to deliberate mortuary ritual find ethno- graphic support, however, and should be considered. In an attempt to define archaeologically the processes underlying bone scatter at Franchthi, attention is given to the strati- graphic contexts of the bones, the demographic structure of the sample, and the relative frequencies of different types of bones represented. Potential sources of bias, such as differ- ential preservation of bone according to relative bone den- sity, are also examined. LAMPS AND LIGHT IN MINOAN FUNERARY RITUAL: Ann C. Blasingham, University of Cincinnati Lamps and light are known to have played a role in Mi- noan religious practices. This paper presents evidence, drawn from a full study of Minoan lamps and their contexts now in progress, for two specific funerary rituals in which lamps and light held central importance and for the reli- gious beliefs informing them. Numerous lamps were recovered from those Mesara tombs which were in use during Middle Minoan I, espe- cially Koumasa B, Platanos B, Porti Pi, and Lebena II. Such factors as location in the tomb, size, shape, material, and traces of use indicate that lamps and lampstands were not simply grave goods. Rather, lamps were lit in the tomb in a funerary ritual analogous to the contemporaneous Egyptian rite in which a lighted lamp was left in the tomb at the time of burial, to comfort the dead. The clay model from Kamilari I, portraying a ceremony, is reinterpreted as the depiction of a Minoan rite similar to the Egyptian "kindling of the lights" at the festival of the dead. The "tables" placed between the small human figures and the towering spirits of the dead are actually lampstands surmounted by lamps such as those found in the tombs and paralleled by Warren's Minoan Stone Vases, Type 24.1 (P293, from Phaistos): the scene represents an offering of light to the ancestors. The surrounding architecture indi- cates that this ritual took place not within the tomb, but in a separate space. The lighted lamp left in the tomb at burial reinforces the suggestion by Branigan and others of a Minoan belief that the spirit remained with the body until decomposition. The ritual depicted in the Kamilari model indicates survival of the spirit after decomposition, and also veneration of the ancestors. DIMENSIONS OF A SOCIAL HIERARCHY IN LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS: AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOR- TUARY DATA FROM ENKOMI: Priscilla Schuster Kes- wani, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor The Late Bronze Age was a period of crucial cultural development in Cyprus, marked by the emergence of major urban centers, intensified copper production and metal- working, and a great expansion of trade, as well as other forms of interaction with the older civilizations of the east- ern Mediterranean. This paper examines the developments in social complexity accompanying these profound economic and political changes, focusing primarily on the mortuary evidence from Enkomi, the most extensively investigated urban center of the Late Cypriot Bronze Age. An analysis of variability in tomb construction, burial program, and grave goods reveals considerable elaboration in the expression of social hierarchy in mortuary practice, and the presence of a diversity of social statuses within as well as between social strata. The redundancy of artifact types and the extended periods of use apparent in some tombs further suggest that in many cases social status and wealth may have been closely associated with descent group affiliation. Changes in the types of goods interred with the dead between the different subphases of the LBA indicate important changes in the symbolism of status, while changes in tomb types and tomb demography may be linked with major redefinitions of the basis of status at the beginning and in the latter part of the Late Cypriot period. These phenomena can also be dis- cerned to some degree at less intensively excavated urban centers in other parts of the island. Developments in social structure and hierarchy evident in the mortuary remains from Enkomi and other sites offer critical insight into both the causes and the consequences of urbanization and ex- panding interregional trade during the LBA in Cyprus. ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE BURIAL PRACTICES OF PRE-CLASSICAL RHODES: Charles Gates, North Carolina Society When I first analyzed the cemeteries of Ialysos and Ka- meiros (Rhodes), I aimed only to clarify the chronology of</page><page sequence="18">246 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 the tomb groups and document the striking changes in bur- ial practices which occurred during the Archaic period (From Cremation to Inhumation: Burial Practices at lalysos and Kameiros during the Mid-Archaic Period, ca. 625-525 B.C. [Los Angeles 1983]). I deliberately postponed discus- sion of why these changes came about and what larger sig- nificance they might have in understanding the formation of Greek culture. Such questions, crucial though they are, prove difficult to formulate and even harder to answer. But Classical ar- chaeologists should not shy away from moving beyond tradi- tional historical-descriptive research if interesting insights can be achieved. Particularly helpful are the growing num- ber of studies on burials and burial practices written by an- thropologists and archaeologists trained in anthropology (see, e.g., the references cited by the contributors to S.C. Humphreys and H. King eds., Mortality and Immortality: The Anthropology and Archaeology of Death [London 1981] and by K. Maurer Trinkaus in "Mortuary Ritual and Mor- tuary Remains," Current Anthropology 25 [1984] 674-79). The many perspectives culled from a variety of prehistoric and historic cultures offer profitable lessons for the student of the early Greek world. This paper examines the applicability of these debates to the funerary remains from Geometric and Archaic Rhodes. The shifting patterns of burial rites and grave offerings re- ceive particular attention: the extent to which they reflect not only religious beliefs but also social organization, and, more importantly, how changes in social structure may help explain the rise of the Greek state. The theories and obser- vations of anthropologists can hardly be expected to solve such majestic problems. Yet despite their limitations, they do free the Rhodian cemeteries to speak with new, unimag- ined eloquence. ROCK-CUT TOMBS OF THE COPPER AGE IN THE TERRI- TORY OF RIBERA (AGRIGENTO, SICILY): Brian E. McConnell, Museo Regionale Archeologico di Agrigento Continuing research in the territory of Ribera by the So- printendenza ai Beni Culturali ed Ambientali di Agrigento is bringing to light two extensive necropoleis of rock-cut shaft tombs (tombe a pozzetto) at Cozzo Mastrogiovanni and Contrada Castello. This type of tomb, a characteristic feature of the Sicilian Copper Age, is found also in Malta, southern Italy, the Cyclades, and Cyprus, and it has been cited as a sign of westward cultural diffusion. Close exami- nation of the tomb structure itself, however, reveals its stages of development in a local context. Prototypic chambers dug into the soil with cumulative burial and pre-Copper Age ceramics discovered by Giu- seppe Castellana at Piano Vento di Palma di Montechiaro indicate that the tomba a pozzetto was created principally as an expression of family ties at the moment in which the necropolis came to be defined as a distinct geographic entity and social monument. The passage from the shaft-tomb dug into the soil to the shaft-tomb dug into the rock was the re- sult of technical improvements in carving tools and tech- niques. The rock chosen for the tombs at Cozzo Mastro- giovanni and Contrada Castello, a soft calcarenite similar to that at other Copper Age necropoleis in western Sicily, facil- itated the creation of the tomba a pozzetto, the earliest form in the long tradition of Sicilian rock-cut chamber tombs. Progressive improvements in carving may be observed in the choice of harder limestone formations for the larger, archi- tecturally more refined tombs of the Bronze Age. THE DIOSCURI AND OTHER TWINS ON ETRUSCAN MIRRORS: Nancy T. de Grummond, Florida State University P. Moscati has recently done a statistical analysis of the most popular figures represented on engraved bronze Etrus- can mirrors, concluding that the Dioscuri are first in the rankings. While their appearance is limited in other media (gems, vases, urns, wall paintings), they appear on dozens of mirrors, most often in a characteristic pattern showing them as twins in mirroring poses, wearing tunic, helmet, or pilos, and having a shield at their feet. It is the purpose of this paper to inquire into the reasons for the popularity of the Dioscuri. Five possible explanations are offered and it is concluded that the most compelling reason is that the Dioscuri are twins, one mortal and one immortal. The mirrors were reg- ularly taken to the grave by Etruscan ladies (in fact, no other type of findspot has been recorded) and, though used first in daily life, must have been decorated with themes appropri- ate for the afterlife. The Etruscan woman may have thought of her beauty instrument as containing her own twin, or soul, and thus would have been unwilling to leave it behind. It has not heretofore been observed that the Dioscuri are actually only one of the sets of twins that appear on mirrors. There are also mirrors with surprising twin images of Menrva (Athena), Turms (Hermes), and Lasa. Apulu and Artumes (Apollo and Artemis) provide another-more or- thodox-example of the theme. Especially similar to the Dioscuri is Hercle (Herakles), because he was one of a pair of twins of whom one was mortal and the other immortal. Hercle is frequently represented alone on Etruscan mirrors, but it is argued here that he does have a twin in Etruria, Vile (= Iolaus rather than Iphicles), who performs deeds similar to his. All these examples will have been chosen by Etrurian women because they alluded to their own double existence, mortal and immortal, in the upper world and in the lower world. MECHANISMS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE IN THE EIGHTH CENTURY B.C.: Barbara A. Fiedler, Franklin and Marshall College This paper explores the evidence for cultural regulation of population growth in the Late Geometric, especially with regard to female fertility. Particular attention is paid to He- siod's view of women and the potential demographic effects of his advice on marriage and child rearing. A connection is</page><page sequence="19">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 247 suggested between these attitudes and archaeologically ob- served changes in the body of mortuary data for the seventh century B.C. The significance of population growth in Greece in the second half of the eighth century B.C. has been debated for the last 10 years (A. Snodgrass, Archaeology and the Rise of the Greek State [Cambridge 1977]; J. Camp, Hesperia 48 [1979] 397-411; T. Gallant, BSA 77 [(1982] 111-24). Vari- ous connections between population increase and social and political changes such as the development of the polis, colo- nization, and the debt-bondage crisis in Attica have been suggested. All these suppositions are based on one of two models which posit a simple and direct relationship between popu- lation and subsistence base. Scholars have either followed Malthus, in requiring an increase in agricultural productiv- ity as a trigger of population growth, or Boserup, in seeing population as an independent factor which initiates change in technology and leads to economic expansion. Although seemingly diametrically opposed, both approaches assume that population increase will follow the potential natural rate of population increase. In fact, population growth is linked to cultural factors and cannot be viewed as an inde- pendent variable. The explanatory potential of demograph- ic changes for the archaeologist cannot be realized until we appreciate the full range of factors involved in a society's reproductive choices. SESSION III D: COLLOQUIUM: DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE IN ANCIENT TUNISIA PUNIC DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE: Mhamed Hassin Fantar, Institut National d'Archeologie et d'Art, Tunis In recent years Punic archaeology has made great pro- gress, thanks to the growing interest everywhere in the Phoenicians and Carthaginians. Sardinia, Sicily, southern Spain, and especially North Africa continue to enrich our knowledge of the Punic world and Carthage. Documenta- tion of Punic domestic architecture is more precise, provid- ing a glimpse into the needs and mentality of its occupants. Forty years ago when one spoke of Punic houses, one could only refer to certain elements recorded by Greek and Latin authors who had never seen a Punic city. Today, the remains at Monte Sirai in Sardinia, Motya in Sicily, Rach- goun and Mercha Medakh in Algeria, and, in Tunisia, Car- thage (Byrsa and Magon sectors) and at Kerkouane (where an entire walled city has been found), we can speak of mate- rials, techniques, shapes, volumes, disposition of spaces and their functions. A rich typology is developing, including houses built around a central court, as well as those with rooms on a single axis. Always there were certain constants, among them the court, principal source of light and air, and almost always a washroom with wardrobe and tub. Today, through the Punic house, the historian can partic- ipate in the daily life of the Punic people, particularly from the end of the fifth to the second half of the second century. HOUSES IN THE LANDSCAPE: TOWARD AN UNDER- STANDING OF RURAL ECONOMY, SOCIETY, AND CUL- TURE IN CENTRAL TUNISIA IN THE ROMANO-BYZAN- TINE PERIOD: R. Bruce Hitchner, University of Vir- ginia Our understanding of rural habitation in the hinterland of North Africa in the Romano-Byzantine period (first-sev- enth century) is minimal by comparison with that of the northwestern provinces. This is particularly unfortunate in view of the great importance of African agriculture to the Roman state throughout the late Republican and Imperial periods. What knowledge we do have is derived from the topographic work of the French Brigade Topographique and the solitary archaeological reconnaissance efforts of Cognat, Saladin, and others around the turn of the century. Accordingly, it has been one of the major objectives of the Kasserine Archaeological Survey, a joint Tuniso-American project, to identify, record, and analyze all types of ancient rural settlement in an area of Roman Africa (the Cillium- Thelepte region) generally believed to have been an impor- tant agricultural zone, particularly for olive cultivation. The results of the survey in this regard have proved significant. Five categories of settlement below the level of hamlet have been identified. These have been provisionally defined as major farm complex, major farm, courtyard farm group, courtyard farm, and small rectangular building. With the exception of the last category, these settlements have in com- mon a ground plan rooted in the concept of a set of rooms or building units set around a level, often enclosed yard. The purpose of this paper is to consider the origin, func- tion, and evolution of each of these settlement types and their relationship to one another, the landscape and field systems which surround them. I also attempt to place them within the context of Romano-African economy, society, and culture. THE HOUSE OF A ROMAN BAILIFF IN KASSERINE: Si- mon Ellis, Cambridge University Most of the buildings examined in the Kasserine survey are poorly preserved, but in 1987 one in which all the walls may be identified with certainty was recorded. Moreover, this was a building of some architectural pretension, whose exterior and many interior walls were contructed of dressed blocks. The structure fulfilled a role within a larger agricultural system, elements of which would have ranged from small farms of tenants or subtenants, to agricultural and adminis- trative buildings, to the residence of the landowner. The building contained four olive presses, demonstrating that part of its role was agricultural. The architectural preten- sion argues that the building was also residential. A rich es- tate owner or aristocrat would require a house with a more classical appearance and would demand such facilities as</page><page sequence="20">248 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 private baths. He would not have been content to live in close proximity to the noise and smell of olive works. Thus the owner of this building was probably a bailiff or local tribal chief dependent upon an absentee estate owner. The paper seeks parallels in domestic architecture to support these assertions. This is one of the first detailed surveys of the kind of es- tablishment that was probably the chief local administrative unit on a large African estate. It illustrates the pretensions of the bailiff or tenant, his private needs in the form of his apartment, and his more public duties in the provision of a large reception room and an olive refinery. The use of such centers for the collection of rents meant that the aristocratic owner could live in the town. His longings for the hunt, as attested in urban mosaics, show that he felt restricted by his urban life, and large villas may be rare in the African countryside. THE MULTIPURPOSE HOUSE OF BACCHUS AND ARIAD- NE AT THUBURBO MAIUS: Margaret A. Alexander, University of Iowa The House of Bacchus and Ariadne, one of the largest at Thuburbo, occupies the major part of an insula in the east- ern part of the city. It is an important example of houses that comprised juxtaposed but intercommunicating units: peri- style house, reception area, artisanal sector. It was certainly the domain of a wealthy and influential Thuburbitan. The disposition of its parts seems to have been planned from the beginning. Although the date of its construction is not yet determined, most of its mosaics were laid in the fourth century. Excavated in 1925, the house and its mosaics have re- ceived little attention. They will be published in the final fascicle of Volume II, on Thuburbo Maius, in the Corpus of the Mosaics of Tunisia. This report is based largely on field- work and researches of the CMT's American-Tunisian team. The paper concentrates on the plan, construction, and decoration of the house. It also draws comparisons with sim- ilar structures at Thuburbo and touches on the role of such large and lavishly decorated houses in the architecture, so- cial, and cultural life of the city. In conclusion, questions are raised about the ways in which separate "public," private, and artisanal areas were combined in Roman houses. Are there any standard princi- ples? Are these provincial or regional distinctions? Or is a house like that of Bacchus and Ariadne a response of a par- ticular client cum architect to the dictates of space, function, status, and wealth? ROMAN HOUSES IN BULLA REGIA: Roger Hanoune, Universit6 de Lille-III Some houses in Bulla Regia (northwest Tunisia, near the Medjerda River) are well known because of their subterra- nean floors. The paper discusses others, with and without such floors, as well as mosaics from the area. 1) Houses without a subterranean floor. Most of these (e.g., House 8) are related to the common Romano-African peristyle type, a residence of the rich urban elite. But some are poor, atypical houses, without peristyle (Houses 11-14). When present, the peristyles are not always rectangular (House 10 has a semicircular one). Usually we see a very late phase (fourth- fifth century) of these buildings, with private basilica (House 3), altered peristyle area (Houses 3, 8), barred por- ticoes, triclinia or large rooms divided into smaller ones (House 7), and new uses for some rooms (such as the Domus Dei in House 10). 2) Houses with a subterranean floor. The largest and richest houses (except House 2), these give evi- dence of a remarkable use of space, light, and water for com- fort and aesthetics. Subterranean floors are of two main types: either three rooms looking out on a straight passage ("Maison du tresor," House of Amphitrite), or a real subter- ranean peristye with four-winged portico ("Maison de la chasse," "Maison de la peche"). Among the reasons for such original planning, local climate and traditions have been emphasized, but reuse and extension of previous cisterns are not to be forgotten. It is not clear why subterranean floors on such a large scale were not, so far as we know, used else- where. For a better understanding of these houses, one has to take into consideration the different stages of their his- tory, as in the "Maison de la chasse": ancient allotment, suc- cessive rebuildings, digging of subterranean floor, further improvements (private basilica; stibadium-type triclinium in "Maison de la p&amp;che," cupola and use of vaulting tubes in "Maison de la chasse." 3) Mosaics. Minor rooms (yards, passages, even sleeping rooms) have geometrical, poorly col- ored mosaic pavements, whereas reception rooms (triclinia, oeci) are decorated with high quality polychrome pave- ments, representing mythological or realistic subjects (e.g., marine triumph of Venus, Perseus and Andromeda, hunting and fishing scenes). Motifs, themes, and style are closely related to those of pavements made in central Tunisian workshops in the fourth century (third- and fifth-century production is not so clearly evident in private houses). URBAN AND RURAL HOUSING IN ANCIENT TUNISIA: HOUSES OF THE THEODOSIAN PERIOD AT CAR- THAGE: Colin M. Wells and Joann Freed, University of Ottawa, and James Gallagher, Trinity University In the course of the University of Ottawa excavations at Carthage over the past 10 years, we have excavated the en- tire width of a city block occupying the south side of decu- manus VI north between cardines II and III east. Only the northern part of this block was accessible, however, because of modern construction to the south, so that we have no com- plete house plan. Nor were we able, for lack of time and money, to excavate below the floors which seem to represent the period immediately preceding the Theodosian Wall, constructed ca. 425 along the line of cardo II and decumanus VI, so that we discuss the Theodosian and succeeding Van- dalic periods. North of the decumanus, however, facing the houses in question, we discovered a massive and enigmatic building which was systematically demolished around the end of the second century A.C., so it is a reasonable pre-</page><page sequence="21">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 249 sumption that Roman construction activity in the area goes back to the second century, if not earlier. House 1, as we have called it, at the corner of decumanus VI and cardo III, had good quality mosaics and its destruc- tion levels had some fine architectural fragments, as well as quite extraordinary quantities of vaulting tubes. There is, however, not much of interest to say about the plan. The house was destroyed and the site remained vacant for much of the sixth and seventh centuries, before being reoccupied in the last generations before the Arab conquest. House 2, in the angle of the decumanus VI and cardo II, raises many more interesting questions, of which the first is whether it was originally one house, as we first supposed, or two, or a series of tenements. Much depends on whether we interpret a central passageway giving access from decu- manus VI as an internal corridor or an open lane. East of this passageway are several rooms with good mosaics, show- ing several periods of repair; there is a portico (only par- tially excavated); a deep cistern; and other interesting features. But in a later phase, no doubt after the construc- tion of the Theodosian Wall along decumanus VI had gross- ly affected the amenities of the property, doorways were blocked, rooms subdivided, and a general decline in the standard of living becomes apparent. A collapsed mudbrick wall yielded valuable ceramic and numismatic evidence, while the revolting eating habits of the occupants provided excellent faunal remains and evidence about their diet. To the west of the central passageway we have a large room which in its final phase was the site of a gristmill (the turning-circle was readily visible). Next to this room was one with a fine mosaic which again had been subdivided and used for artisanal purposes. Once more, one is inclined to blame the deleterious effect on the property of the Theodo- sian Wall. An unresolved question concerns the location of the entrance to the property once the original entrance from the decumanus was blocked. Questions of phasing, strati- graphy, and ceramic evidence are discussed. The ceramic evidence suggests that the structure collapsed in whole or in part early in the sixth century, and that the site was leveled, filled, and reused in the seventh. SESSION III E: COLLOQUIUM: PRESERVING FIELD RECORDS. ARCHIVAL TECH- NIQUES FOR ARCHAEOLOGISTS DIGGING FOR DATA: Shari Taylor, Princeton Univer- sity As Curator of Research Photographs for the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University, I am re- sponsible for the preservation and organization of the rec- ords from five excavations that have been sponsored by Princeton. Although this is only one of the characteristic duties of the position, it is one that has placed increased de- mands on a curator. Princeton's archives consist of various materials from the following: 1) Bruennow and Domazewski, 1897-1898, con- sisting of photographs of sites such as Amman, Bosra, and Petra on glass taken to provide illustrations for Die Provin- cia Arabia, 1904-1909. 2) American Archaeological Expe- ditions to Syria 1899-1900, Princeton Archaeological Expe- ditions to Syria 1904-1905, 1909, and American Society for the Excavation of Sardis 1910-1914, are collectively known as the Butler Collection, named for Howard Crosby Butler. The photographs are of secular buildings, fortifications, churches, and monasteries dating from the first through the seventh century. 3) Committee for the Excavation of An- tioch and its Vicinity, 1932-1939, are photographs of ob- jects from Antioch and Daphne, a suburb of the ancient cap- ital. The interest in Syria, initiated by Butler, resulted in Princeton's Antioch excavation assisted by the Baltimore Museum of Art, Worcester Museum of Art, and Musees Nationaux de France. 4) Princeton Archaeological Expedi- tion to Morgantina (serra Orlando), Sicily in 1955, docu- mented in slides and photographs the site and its objects as well as the development of the city from prehistoric to early Roman times. Begun by Princeton, the work continues under the direction of Malcolm Bell of the University of Virginia. 5) Princeton Archaeological Expedition to Polis (Cyprus), begun in 1983, is led by William Childs of Princeton, who is now exploring the Archaic and Classical city of Marion and the Hellenistic-Roman city of Arsinoe. Together the collections form an invaluable resource con- sisting of photographs, slides, negatives (35mm, 6 x 6cm, 4 x 5", Leica, glass), microfilms, drawings, inventories, field notebooks, and other secondary records. Each collection has its own system of organization and consequently its own set of problems. Collectively they share similar problems of preservation, storage, access, and organization. It is hoped that by addressing these problems, suggestions for future ex- cavations and solutions for current archivists may present themselves. THE COMPUTERIZED ARCHIVES OF THE NEMEA VAL- LEY ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: Mary K. Dabney, Columbia University The Nemea Valley Archaeological Project, a program of regional study of the Nemea Valley in the northeastern Peloponnesos, is composed of archaeological survey, envi- ronmental and anthropological studies, and excavation of prehistoric remains on the hill of Tsoungiza. Planned as a large, interdisciplinary project, we anticipated that all the records had to be accessible to scholars with various inter- ests. A recording system compatible with these various inter- ests and the limitations of a microcomputer was devised and employed from the beginning of the project in 1984. The system allowed constant checking on the quality of data col- lected in the field, and facilitated the coordination of prelim- inary analyses of the finds. Twenty-eight scholars from 20 different institutions in the United States, Great Britain, and Greece are currently taking part in the publication. The computerized archives, located in Nemea during the sum- mer field season and in the United States during the aca- demic year, make it possible for each scholar to obtain rec- ords without a laborious search through field notebooks, preliminary pottery study notes, photographs, and draw-</page><page sequence="22">250 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 ings. Moreover, the data for which statistical analyses and computer graphic displays are appropriate are already in a suitable format and can be transferred to other personal and mainframe computers for these purposes. THE PRESERVATION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC ARCHAEOLOG- ICAL RECORDS: Craig Mauzy, American School of Classical Studies at Athens The preservation of archaeological records has become an increasingly important concern for those who make use of the records and those who have been given the responsibility for their storage. Archaeology is essentially a destructive process which relies to a great extent on the strength of its record keeping. Photography, as used by archaeologists, has proven indispensible in quickly and accurately recording de- tails which may be difficult to describe verbally or to draw. Housed within the archives of the American School of Clas- sical Studies at Athens is a body of archaeological photo- graphic material that dates from the 1880s. These photo- graphic images document not only the investigations of ex- cavators and researchers, but also serve to illustrate the de- velopment of photographic processes during the past 100 years. I illustrate in this paper problems confronted while managing these photographic archives. Topics discussed include the identification of unstable materials and suggest- ed methods for copying and duplication, ideal photographic storage conditions, ways to salvage an archive which has suffered water damage, and precautions to prevent and pre- pare for a possible disaster. PRESERVING AND DISSEMINATING Low-ALTITUDE AE- RIAL PHOTOGRAPHS: J. Wilson Myers, Boston Uni- versity The specialty of low-altitude aerial photography of ar- chaeological sites has been developed to record relationships and patterns that are not always visible or comprehensible from the ground. Our collection, after 15 years in the field, consists of some 8000 frames in 60cm and 35mm formats recording over 100 Mediterranean sites. Negatives and prints are developed or enlarged to archival standards and stored in chemically neutral envelopes or mounted on acid- free boards with non-contaminating adhesive. Slides are protected in glass. Dissemination has taken several forms: prints and slides are given directly to excavators and rele- vant archaeological officials. These are used for study, for teaching purposes, for publication, and for the permanent record of the excavation or survey. Publication of our Aerial Atlas of Ancient Crete will soon present color photographs of 43 major sites in 10 x 10" format. A third form of dissemi- nation, made possible through a recent National Endow- ment for the Humanities grant, will permit us to place an archive of 500 mounted aerial prints for study by scholars at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, with a similar set to be housed at the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University. But for more permanent storage and bet- ter access we plan ultimately to record all our images on a single small optical disc. As soon as both the hardware and software, including indexing methods, become standardized for libraries and archives, we hope to scan the images and reduce them to digitized signals on one 4.7" CD ROM disc. Read by a frictionless light beam and capable of holding as many as 3000 images, the disc allows computer index search for individual images or classes of images and presents the image in color on a computer screen. At moderate resolution the computer disc offers an ideal finding device for a photo- graphic archive; at resolutions which may approach those of the original photograph, the system can distribute virtually permanent copies of huge archives at extremely low cost to the user. CONTEMPORARY ARCHAEOLOGY IN ROME: THE AR- CHIVAL EVIDENCE: James E. Packer, Northwestern University Although archaeology is inextricably woven into the fab- ric of daily life in Rome-a city nearly three millennia old- there, as elsewhere, it is synonymous with digging below the levels of the modern city. And yet, for the archaeologist in Rome, research in the archives of the excavations of the 19th and 20th centuries is an indispensible tool. The Forum of Trajan, which I have studied over the last 15 years, is an excellent example of the kinds of material available. Now preserved in the library of the Accademia di S. Luca, drawings by the early 19th-century architect Anto- nia De Romanis record the earliest scientific excavation of the site by the imperial regime of Napoleon. Fragments of sculpture and architecture found in the small excavations of the later 19th century appear in the slightly later renderings executed by the fellows of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. For the large-scale excavations of Mussolini, there are two major archives: the photographs in Palazzo Braschi and some of the excavators' notes and drawings in a small Mediaeval house near the ancient Portico of Octavia and the Theater of Marcellus. Yet, while extraordinarily varied and numerous, the ma- terials on the Forum of Trajan typify those which record many of the ancient monuments. In addition, photographers and architects employed by the Superintendency of Latium and the City of Rome annually document the results of new excavations; and, as aids to repair and consolidation, both the Superintendency and the City commission measured drawings of standing monuments. Little of this invaluable visual information is ever published: filed in the appropriate archive, most is simply forgotten. It is hoped that archaeo- logists of the future will no longer make that mistake. SUGGESTIONS FOR MAKING THE RESULTS OF FIELD- WORK MORE ACCESSIBLE: Gene Waddell, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities Resolutions are recommended to help ensure the preser- vation of information about sites and to help make this in- formation more accessible: 1) Sponsors of archaeological work should require decisions in advance of funding about where artifacts and field notes are to be stored and when they will be opened to outside researchers. Field notes and</page><page sequence="23">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 251 artifacts should be kept together in a repository, and entrust- ed to a staff competent to care for the material and to make it accessible. Access to artifacts and notes should be restricted no longer than five years. 2) Microform security copies of field notes (including photographs) should be stored in a location a safe distance from the originals. 3) Sponsors should require and fund the preparation of an informal, preliminary publication on each season's work (produced by photocopy, microform, etc.) before funding another season's work. All major artifacts should be illustrated, with their original locations specified. Copies should be available at nominal cost. 4) A higher priority should be given to obtain- ing grants a) for preparing guides to the location of field notes, for inventorying field notes, for microfilming notes for security purposes and to reassemble scattered notes, and for preparing microform publications of notes on major sites; b) for funding translations of notes not in English; and c) for encouraging archaeologists to complete descriptions of their own fieldwork or to write about the fieldwork of their predecessors. SESSION III F: POSTER SESSION I EARLY BRONZE AGE LITHARES, AS ILLUSTRATED THROUGH A MODEL: Dorothy Dvorsky Rohner, University of Colorado, Boulder I have constructed a scaled model of the site of Lithares, an Early Bronze Age site, in consultation with the excavator (H. Tzavella-Evjen, Lithares [Athens 1985]). The poster presentation consists of multi-viewed photographs of this model which illustrate the preservation of the ruins (at foun- dation level) and reconstruction of the dwellings, with em- phasis placed on techniques and materials employed by EBA builders (A. Sampson, Manika [Athens 1985]). The model has significant educational value in the description of the earliest pre-planned architectural development in city organization of an EBA site along with replicas of pottery and tools in scale. Lithares was a pre-planned community organized along a main street with connecting alleys. The pottery and other artifacts found there shed new light upon EBA life. The model photographs are supplemented with topographical maps, plans of the site, and photographs of the excavation and characteristic artifacts, some of which are unique. The finds are classified in context of religion, art, industry, and trade. This is a first attempt in the reconstruction of an EBA settlement based on materials from the excavation and other contemporary sites. As such it invites comment and discus- sion on building techniques, environment, and community interaction. WESTERN COURTYARDS AND WESTERN FACADES IN MINOAN ARCHITECTURE: Carol Hershenson, Uni- versity of Cincinnati Monumental western facades, often associated with western courtyards, have a long history in Minoan architec- ture. Obvious examples are the Neo-Palatial western walls of the palaces at Phaistos, Knossos, and Mallia, each facing a large western courtyard. Well-built ashlar western fa- cades are also found at the so-called Palace at Gournia and the Little Palace at Knossos, both fronting onto small west- ern courts. In the Proto-Palatial period, the palaces again provide the best-preserved examples of monumental west- ern exteriors. At Phaistos there were two different western facades of krepidoma and orthostate construction, each over- looking a paved western courtyard. The Early Minoan IIA West Court House at Knossos has the earliest marked west- ern facade, predating the use of cut-block masonry on Crete. Its western exterior wall is of different construction from the other walls of the building, and it faces a yard to the west. The actual construction of these western walls varies ac- cording to the techniques known and fashionable in each pe- riod. Some features of these monumental facades served to strengthen the walls structurally, but other aspects appear largely aesthetic. While other exterior walls might also be monumentally treated, the special prominence of visually distinguished western facades is striking, as is their repeated association with western courtyards throughout the history of Minoan architecture. Standing in such a courtyard and facing the associated building, one faces east, toward the ris- ing sun; this, together with the apparent ceremonial trap- pings of the western courts of the palaces, suggests that these fine western facades formed a visual backdrop for some dawn ritual. THE LIVING SUBJECTS OF MINOAN MARINE-STYLE ART: Ray Porter, New York Society Color photographs are presented to illustrate the natural equivalents of the animals and elements of the settings that make up Minoan Marine-style art. Close attention to the natural history data allows specific conclusions to be made about the nature of the Minoan artists' translations of ma- rine life in their art and of its meaning for them. Specific animals to be presented include the flying fish, the dolphin, the argonaut, and the octopus. Comparison of Minoan depictions of the behavior of animals with ethno- logical evidence reveals a number of new instances of sensi- tive obvervation of nature on the part of the Minoans. The Minoan flying fish are a species of gurnard that actually has blue butterfly-shaped "wings." The Minoans based their art on two different species of dolphin but altered the natural striping of the body to suggest speed, reflected sunlight, and wet bodies. The Minoan portrayal of argonauts includes ac- curate observations of the large eyes, natural coloration, and the function of the shell as an egg nest, identifying them as female. The octopuses on the Dendra cup can also be identi- fied as females protecting the eggs in their nests. These sug- gest new interpretations for the role these animals played in the Minoan cosmology. The "coral" and "rockwork" can actually be identified as soft coral incrustations, sponges, sea fans, and sea anemone. No hard coral exists in the Mediterranean. The star motif finds its origin in the feeding polyps of the soft corals.</page><page sequence="24">252 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 A number of new phenomena can be identified: life in tidal pools, waves breaking on rocks with sea life, and beaches with washed-up seashells. A 120-TON LINTEL BLOCK AT MYCENAE: TRANSPOR- TATION AND POSITIONING: Raffaele Santillo, Lund Institute of Technology This study is part of a joint research program on Myce- naean tholoi construction (B.S. Frizell and R. Santillo, OpAth 15 [1984] 45-52, and R. Santillo, Edilizia militare 17-18). The slabs were transported on sleds. The power was supplied by relatively few men with simple machines and mechanisms of the cam type, which could generate great force. The inward inclination of the stomion walls is due to the Mycenaeans' understanding of the laws of elementary physics. This inclination is necessary to mount the self-lock- ing devices, enabling the lowering of the slab after the launching and to avoid mutual displacement of the lateral blocks during maneuvering. The launching was executed in the same fashion as a modern Bailey military bridge. The quarry has been located 7 km. from Mycenae. The ancient route followed the modern road from the village of Mycenae to the ancient site. The slope has been verified and no other road was possible. I have found that the experimental de- vices for the determination of the friction value were of the same type as those used by C.A. Coulomb in the 18th cen- tury. Apart from figures and drawings, I also present models in scale. The same means of transportation and positioning are still in use today, especially in shipyards. The results suggest that it is possible to set back the dates of the development of science (as Van der Vaerden, Geometry and Algebra in An- cient Civilisations [New York 1981] has done in the field of mathematics). Some particular features suggest that the Mycenaean people intentionally left signs and messages in the masonry walls for the following generations. The logical rigor expressed in a sentence attributed to Demokritos, "No one surpasses me in the construction of lines with proofs," was already part of the Mycenaean Greek mentality. Their procedure was strictly rational, and did not rely on the con- cept commonly called "rule of thumb." SESSION IV A: PREHISTORIC AEGEAN THE EARLIER PHASES OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE AT TSOUNGIZA HILL, ANCIENT NEMEA, GREECE: Dan- iel J. Pullen, Sardis Expedition, Harvard Univer- sity J.P. Harland's unpublished 1926-1927 excavations on Tsoungiza Hill, ancient Nemea, revealed evidence for all three periods of the Early Bronze Age. The 1984-1986 ex- cavations by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project un- covered stratified remains from earlier phases of the EBA. Additional evidence comes from 1984 salvage excavations. Study of the stratigraphic and ceramic evidence indicates that Tsoungiza was occupied in the earlier part of the EBA. After an apparent hiatus, reoccupation took place in Early Helladic III. Especially important for our understanding of the EBA in southern Greece are several stratified deposits of ceramics from EH I and the early phases of EH II which al- low the first detailed characterization of ceramics from these phases. Also important are architectural remains which doc- ument the settlement's growth in these early phases. Architectural remains have not yet been assigned with any certainty to EH I. A number of pits and a deep cistern provide closed contexts for EH I ceramics. A variety of open and closed shapes are found in both plain and slipped and burnished wares. A small structure yielded large quantities of pottery from the very beginning of EH II. Red Urfirnis paint appears, but sauceboats remain to be identified. A series of stratified buildings and surfaces allows the con- struction of an EH II ceramic sequence. The latest EH II at Tsoungiza, well before the end of the period, is represented by a burnt room with a number of small carinated bowls. EARLY BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT IN SOUTHERN GREECE: NEW DATA FROM THE NEMEA VALLEY: Laurie Roberts, Boston University Recent investigations conducted in 1984-1986 by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project (NVAP) provide new insight with regard to the extent and nature of settlement within the Nemea Valley and its neighboring regions during the Early Bronze Age. Substantial quantities of EH I material have been identi- fied at only one location and traces at more than half a dozen. These locations are outside the Nemea Valley prop- er. Apart from the site at Tsoungiza, there is no evidence for EH I activity within the Valley. These data continue the pattern evident in the Neolithic pottery collected within the main Nemea Valley in which there was very little Middle Neolithic and nothing that could be confidently called Final Neolithic. In contrast, EH II pottery was found in quantity at half a dozen sites and occurred at more than two dozen other locations within and without the Nemea Valley. Tsoungiza was also occupied in the earlier part of this period and again in EH III. The Survey collected very little evidence of EH III activity within the Valley. In combina- tion with geomorphological information, the settlement pat- tern revealed by the Survey data may shed light on social and economic development both within and without the Nemea Valley. These results differ from those of surveys in other areas of the Peloponnesos where higher population densities seem to have been characteristic already in the Final Neolithic and EH I periods. The difficulty of dividing material col- lected through surface survey into subphases may account in part for the apparent differential in development in other regions of the Peloponnesos. The careful dating of EH ma- terial collected by NVAP allows discussion of development over time within the EH period and will contribute to our understanding of the social and economic changes within this period.</page><page sequence="25">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 253 BRONZE AGE AGRICULTURE IN THE NEMEA VALLEY: Julie Hansen, Boston University One of the primary questions being addressed by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project (NVAP) concerns the level at which basic subsistence was maintained. The struc- ture of the subsistence system is examined in order to under- stand how it must have been supported. Plant remains from the Bronze Age site of Tsoungiza were recovered through a systematic watersieving process. The results of the analysis of these remains offer a preliminary assessment of the level of basic subsistence at this site. Emmer wheat, six-row barley, lentils, vetch, and peas provided the basic botanical resources cultivated by the Ear- ly Bronze Age inhabitants of Tsoungiza. In addition, acorns provided a valuable source of protein and fat in the diet. The contexts and composition of the botanical assemblage sug- gest that the site was not a major surplus producer at this time, but rather a subsistence-level farmstead. In the late Middle Helladic and early Late Helladic, viti- culture expanded the agricultural base of the site, and chick peas were also added to the diet. Acorns appear to have been abandoned by this time as a food source. The composition of the primary grape seed deposit suggests that the grapes were used in the production of wine. In order to determine wheth- er the wine was exclusively consumed locally or produced in sufficient quantities for distribution to neighboring regions, thus raising the level of subsistence above that of the small farmstead, the history of wine production in the Nemea re- gion and the possible land use pattern in the Bronze Age are examined. The available data suggest that Tsoungiza was never a wine-production center during the Bronze Age, but rather that it remained throughout its occupation a small farming community of subsistence-level farmers. BUREAUCRACY AND PACKAGING AT LERNA: EVIDENCE FROM THE CLAY SEALINGS IN THE HOUSE OF TILES: Sarah Tyrrell Stewart, University of Toronto Some 140 clay sealing fragments representing 70 distinct seals have been found in a single deposit in Room XI of the House of the Tiles at Lerna (Heath, Hesperia 27 [1958] 81-121). This interesting deposit presents two problems, namely how the sealings were used and how they came to be deposited in this location. I propose that the patterns of use of these sealings indi- cate their function, the number of containers to which they were affixed, and their manner of storage. It would appear that this large number of sealings was attached to only a small number of containers, which could easily have been stored either within or above Room XI. This hypothesis is tested through a detailed examination of the seal types and the distinctive patterns of use of specific examples. Heath has initially catalogued the sealings by the type of containers upon which the sealings were applied. The container types were determined by the types of mark- ings left on the underside of the moist clay sealings as they were applied to the container. My reconstruction of sealing and container use at Lerna is based both on Heath's cata- logue of container types and on my own identification of four distinct groupings indicating seal use, the groups being isolated by their patterns of occurrence. The seals probably indicate ownership, inventory, con- tents, or origin, and their patterns of use show that a logical system of packaging, processing, and storage of goods was in operation at the House of the Tiles. SNAKES AND LIONS: A NEW READING OF THE WEST HOUSE FRESCOES FROM THERA: Karen Polinger Foster, Wesleyan University The paintings from Rooms 4 and 5 of the West House at Thera have been the most extensively studied of the frescoes thus far discovered at that site. This paper is based on a reassessment of the many theories already proposed about the West House frescoes. These theories have yet to account satisfactorily for all aspects of the iconographical and ar- chaeological evidence available. It is suggested that the West House paintings commemo- rate and describe a Cycladic jubilee, showing strong influ- ence of the Egyptian Sed Festival in both structure and sub- stance. Seen in this light, the diverse and seemingly unre- lated elements in the frescoes coalesce into a meaningful program for the first time. Crucial for this new reading are the eight structures painted at full-scale in Room 4 and repeated in miniature on the sterns of the boats in Room 5. These, together with their stern totems of snakes and lions, attest to a fundamental geo- cultic duality: a Cycladic league with two groups of three or four members each, for which Egyptian and other Bronze Age parallels can be adduced. In the absence of texts, some features of the Cycladic jubilee may never be fully under- stood, but we seem here in the West House frescoes to glimpse an actual enactment of such a festival. RooM D2 AND THE SWALLOWS OF AKROTIRI, THERA: Mary B. Hollinshead, Brown University The fresco covering three walls of Room 2 of Building Delta (the "Room of the Lilies" or the "Spring Fresco") is a lyrical scene of swallows flying among red lilies in a rocky landscape. Specific details of the plants and birds are ren- dered with such accuracy that the setting can be identified as summer, rather than spring. The lilies of D2 were painted after the swallows, proba- bly by a different artist. The painter of the D2 swallows was undoubtedly responsible for the nearly identical swallows amid crocuses on a fresco fragment from Room 2 of Xeste 3. Collaboration based on subcontracting specific jobs, such as plants, to specialist painters is proposed. Specialization in birds is not documented. Although swallows are frequent subjects of Theran vase decoration, there is no evidence of crossover between mural and ceramic artists. On the other hand, parallels of technique and composition suggest that the antelopes of Room 1, Building Beta, should be attrib- uted to the painter of the D2 swallows, an association sup- ported by the archaeological context of the respective paint- ings. The walls of D2 were rearranged and rebuilt before</page><page sequence="26">254 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 the swallows and lilies were painted, and the antelopes of B1 were painted over an earlier fresco. Our painter is thus active in restoration work in three buildings after the pre- liminary earthquake, and before the volcanic eruption of the island. A MYCENAEAN PERFUMED OIL WORKSHOP AT ZY- GOURIES? Patrick M. Thomas, University of North Carolina In his excavations at Zygouries in 1921-1922, Carl Ble- gen excavated a group of rooms forming the basement of a large Mycenaean house which contained more than 1300 unused pots. Blegen concluded that the complex represented storerooms for a potter's shop (Blegen, Zygouries [1928] 38; 221-22). Although the existence of a ceramic workshop at Zygouries is possible, the lack of a kiln and water supply, the basement location, and the site of the building on the side of a hill, with little exterior working space, do not suggest any direct connection between these rooms and such an establishment. Comparison of the pottery with contemporary LH IIIB: I settlement deposits shows that the "Potter's Shop" had an extremely restricted range of decorated vessels, and a high proportion of relatively uncommon plain types. A function can be suggested for at least some of these vessels. Rooms 13 and 33 together contain a group of vessels possibly used in the manufacture of perfumed oil. Recent investigations of the Mycenaean perfumed oil industry have shown that its manufacturing process probably closely resembled the later practices described by Theophrastus (De odoribus 7-59) and Dioscorides (De materia medica 1.42-63). The vessels from Rooms 13 and 33 correspond generally in form to those types said to have been used in the process, and the presence of large stirrup jars of the type associated with the transport and storage of bulk liquids, particularly oil, is itself sugges- tive. The actual manufacture of perfumed oil undoubtedly took place elsewhere at the site, but the necessary equipment was grouped together, ready for use, in these rooms. This interpretation, if accepted, markedly alters and extends the conventional understanding of the "Potter's Shop." FIGS AND VINES IN MYCENAEAN AGRICULTURE: Ruth Palmer, University of Cincinnati The cultivation and collection of tree crops was of impor- tance to the centralized Mycenaean economy. Once pro- cessed, fruits such as figs, grapes, and olives have a long stor- age life. In Linear A and B tablets recording these commodi- ties, figs and wine frequently occur together, as if the scribes consider these a natural pair. The titles o-pi-su-ko and o-pi- ka-pe-e-we appearing together in PY Jn829 probably signi- fy overseers of figs and vines, respectively. KN Gv863 specifically lists vines and figs together. The word for vines is we-je-we, *huiewes, which is found in Hesychius as a synonym for anadendras, a vine trained up a tree. Both Greek and Roman agricultural writers mention this practice. The syntax of KN Gv863 indicates that the vines grew upon the fig trees listed in the same line. Here the ratio of vines to fig trees is four to one, the number recom- mended by Columella (Rust. 5.6.11). Training vines up a tree may represent the oldest form of viticulture, since it reproduces the natural habitat of the wild vine. Theophrastus mentions fig trees carrying vines (Caus. P1. 3.10.8, 5.5.4), so in Greece the fig tree may have been the favored support of anadendrades. Even though the presence of vines would reduce the yield of the fig tree, the planting of anadendrades represents the most productive use of a limited space. KN Gv863 may have been specifically drafted to show that these vines grew upon fig trees, in order to adjust the projected yield of the grapes and figs. AN UNPUBLISHED EGYPTIAN PLAQUE FROM MYCE- NAE: THE KEY TO A PROPER RECONSTRUCTION: Eric Cline, University of Pennsylvania In 1968, a large fragment of a faience plaque with the cartouche of Amenhotep III was uncovered within the Cult Center at Mycenae. Although a brief mention appeared in Antiquity 43 (1969) 95-96, the plaque has never been fully published. Despite the lack of information concerning the appearance of the plaque, it has been cited on a number of occasions and is recognized as an important artifact for Egypto-Aegean studies. A total of 10 such plaque fragments have been found at Mycenae by Tsountas, Mylonas, and Taylour. During the past decade a few scholars, most not- ably Hankey and Helck, have addressed the problem of a proper reconstruction of the original plaques, both as to their number and the cartouches inscribed upon them. Careful study of Taylour's partial plaque, combined with fresh observations of Tsountas's and Mylonas's fragments, indicates that the plaques are identically inscribed on both obverse and reverse faces with the pre-nomen and nomen of Amenhotep III, that there were originally at least six-and possibly as many as nine-plaques rather than four as pre- viously thought, and that their original votive nature ap- pears to have been understood by the Mycenaeans. The proper reconstruction of these plaques and an understand- ing of their function and use at Mycenae will help to shed additional light on the relations between the Aegean and Egypt during the latter part of the second millennium B.C. AN ANALYSIS OF THE LH IIIC POTTERY FROM TROY VIIA: A REEXAMINATION OF FIND CONTEXTS AND DECORATION: Roy Curtis Green, University of Pennsylvania The LH IIIB date proposed by Carl Blegen for the de- struction of Troy VIIa has lately come under increased criti- cism largely due to two analyses of Mycenaean pottery from the site, the first carried out by Carl Nylander in the early 1960s, the second more recently by C.B. Mee. Both scholars have argued that a number of sherds, from what Mee called uncontaminated VIIa deposits, should be attributed to LH IIIC, and thus that the fall of Troy VIIa could not have taken place until some point after the beginning of the LH IIIC phase. The conclusions of Nylander and Mee have been accepted by a number of scholars and popularized by</page><page sequence="27">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 255 Michael Wood's BBC series, and have helped fuel the fires of the long-standing controversy over the identity of the Troy of Homer. This paper reexamines the find contexts of the sherds at- tributed to LH IIIC by Mee and Nylander, and shows that the majority came either from deposits which Blegen clearly stated were greatly disturbed and useless for purposes of dating, or from areas showing signs of a high probability of disturbance. Furthermore, this paper also reexamines the decorative motifs on these "LH IIIC" sherds themselves, and argues that many of them fit far better into the LH IIIB repertoire. Thus, the author concludes that there is no firm evidence to place the date of the destruction of Troy VIIa outside the span of the LH IIIB period.

SESSION IV B: ICONOGRAPHY AND RELI- GION THE ELEUSINIAN DADOUCHOS AND THE ORIGIN OF "PRIESTLY GARB": Margaret C. Miller, McMaster University Despite E. Simon's work (Festivals of Attica [Wisconsin 1983] 64), there is no evidence for the existence of special sacerdotal clothing in Classical Attic cult, except in the case of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Literary testimony refers to the distinctive garb of the hierophantes and dadouchos; late red- figure vase-paintings indicate that a tunic-like garment, the ependytes, was part of the recognized insignia of the da- douchos. Yet even this example of formalized religious dress appears to have been a recent innovation. The earliest evi- dence for the ependytes in Eleusinian cult is a stamnos of ca. 435 (Eleusis 636); on a skyphos some 30 years earlier the dadouchos appears in chiton and himation only (Brussels A10). The adoption of the ependytes should be dated to the intervening period (Plutarch's anecdote, Arist. 5.7-8, is hardly creditable evidence to the contrary). Our knowledge of contemporary Athenian fashion is in harmony with a mid-fifth century date for the adoption of this Eastern garment, and so, indeed, is the evidence of the history of the Eleusinian priesthood itself. Kallias (II) Hip- ponikou, erstwhile ambassador to Susa and the wealthiest Greek of his day, served as dadouchos from ca. 490 until after 445. It was he who introduced this luxurious and dis- tinctive dress to the cult; by the end of his long term of office the ependytes had become an institution. This study provides evidence of a trend of increasing "for- mality" in Attic cult. There is danger in viewing cult prac- tice in Classical Athens holus bolus as homogeneous, or indi- vidual cults as static. For this period it is methodologically unsound to assume the concept of sacred vestments when a person engaged in religious activities is depicted wearing a distinctive garment. No symbolic significance can be at- tached to such garments worn by priests in the fifth century. THE MYSTERIES OF ARTEMIS AT EPHESOS: Guy M. Rogers, Wellesley College We can glimpse the annual celebration of the mysteries of Artemis at Ephesos from the time of Lysimachus until Com- modus. Recent studies of the site (D. Knibbe, "Ursprung, Begriff und Wesen der ephesischen Kureten," Forschungen in Ephesos IX [Vienna 1981] 70-92) and publication of in- scriptions (Die Inschriften von Ephesos Ia [Bonn 1979] 26, 27) clarify how reenactment of the birth of Artemis helped articulate the relationship between the ruling power and the city. During the Hellenistic period Lysimachus "arranged all the other things concerning the mysteries" (IvE 26). His careful direction of the Gerousia's sacrifice and banquet at the festival reflected the facts of power in the city: the Ge- rousia and the epikletoi "administered all the affairs of the city" (Strab. Geography 14.1.21). At the time of Strabo, the prytanis, attached to the new Augustan prytaneion, man- aged the festival and recorded the ritual practices of the Ku- retes during the mysteries. The increasingly self-conscious role of the Kuretes in the festival followed construction of the Augustan prytaneion. In A.D. 104, C. Vibius Salutaris's endowment of lotteries and distributions at the festival (IvE 27) created a civic hier- archy which validated the tribes, the Boule, and the Gerou- sia above all. Under Commodus the Gerousia sacrificed to Artemis and the Emperor (IvE 26). Artemis now shared her birthday with the Emperor. From Lysimachus to Commo- dus, Ephesians adapted their festival to a changing world and a changing world to their festival. THE LAKONIAN DIOSKOUROI RELIEFS: Jan Motyka Sanders, University of Missouri-Columbia Kastor and Polydeukes, the Lakonian Dioskouroi, are represented by a group of nearly 50 votive reliefs from Spar- ta and Lakonia, now in the Archaeological Museum in Sparta. The Lakonian reliefs form the largest corpus of vo- tive material dedicated to the twins from a single area and are, moreover, one of the most significant groups of extant sculpture produced in Lakonian workshops. Stylistically, the earliest reliefs are roughly contemporary with the Second Messenian War, fought toward the close of the seventh century. Prevailing opinion regards the Lakoni- an Dioskouroi as local chthonic heroes. It seems likely, how- ever, that the Dioskouroi were worshipped in Archaic La- konia as the embodiment of the military and ethical stan- dards recorded by the contemporary Spartan poet Tyrtaios. As the divine counterparts of the Spartan hereditary dual kingship, the Dioskouroi legitimized the aggressive action of Sparta against Messenia. The results of the subjective stylistic analysis were tested against the results of an objective content analysis completed with the aid of a computer. A pattern indicated two later peaks in the production of the Dioskouroi reliefs in Lakonia.</page><page sequence="28">256 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 It is significant that these, occurring in the third century B.C. and again in the second century A.C., coincide with two conscious revivals of the Archaic traditions associated with the Spartan lawmaker Lykourgos and current at the time of the Second Messenian War. No CONSTELLATIONS FOR ISRAEL? Lucille A. Roussin, Yeshiva University The prominence in ancient synagogue decoration of the representation of the 12 signs of the zodiac in a radial ar- rangment around the chariot of the sun with the person- ifications of the four seasons surrounding it has long posed a problem for scholars of Late Antique art and religion. The frequency and persistence of this composition in Palestinian synagogue decoration indicates that it cannot have been an unconscious copying of a pagan model; it is rather a delib- erate adoption of the composition. Avi Yonah sought to explain the presence of the zodiac in the synagogue mosaics as a kind of liturgical calendar, bas- ing his argument on the relationship of stone inscriptions of the 24 priestly courses of I Chronicles XXIV:1-9 to He- brew liturgical poetry. A number of factors militate against acceptance of this theory. The Jewish festival calendar is a lunar calendar, and the priestly courses were related to that calendar and not to the solar zodiacal calendar. The fact that in most of the preserved zodiac pavements the seasons and months do not correspond also makes calendrical interpre- tation unlikely. Despite the statement of Rabbi Johanan that "there are no constellations for Israel" (Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat, 156a), there seems to be abundant evidence for the practice of magic, astrology, and angel worship among the Jews in the Late Antique period. The Sefer Harazim (Book of Se- crets), a text of the late third or early fourth century, is par- ticularly important because it was widely influential even among the Orthodox Jews and shows that the worship of angels was accepted as compatible with worship of Yahweh as the sole, supreme God. All the elements of the Sefer Hara- zim have their counterparts in the Helios-in-zodiac compo- sitions depicted in the synagogue pavements. In all cases the radial zodiac composition forms the middle field of decora- tion, while above it is a representation of the Torah Shrine and Jewish liturgical implements and below it is a biblical scene or an inscription. When the overall compositions of the synagogue pavements are analyzed in terms of the struc- ture of the Sefer Harazim, the symbolism becomes clear. The lowest level represents the earthly realm, the Helios-in- zodiac panel in the center represents the celestial sphere, and in the highest sphere is the Torah Shrine panel, sym- bolic of the seventh firmament where Yahweh resides. THREE MANTLED LADIES: AN ICONOGRAPHICAL RAR- ITY: John H. Oakley, College of William and Mary in Virginia In 1971 D. Adamesteanu published an Attic red-figure column-krater from Pisticci with the flight of Perseus from the Gorgons on the obverse. The figures on the reverse were described as three females in conversation, but they can now be identified as the Graiai, sisters of the Gorgons. There are two versions of the encounter between the Graiai and Perseus. In the first, Perseus took the one eye and tooth which they shared and refused to give them back, until they told him the way to the nymphs who had the equipment he needed to face the Gorgons. In the second, which is connected with Aeschylus's lost play, the Phorkides, Perseus had already been outfitted by Hermes when he approached the Graiai who were guarding the Gorgons. He sneaked up, stole the eye, and cast it in a lake. Having blinded the guards, he proceeded on to the Gorgons. The four previously known depictions of this myth have been associated with the second version: a fourth-century Etruscan mirror, a Hellenistic relief bowl, and two Attic red-figure vases of 430-424 B.C. The sudden appearance around 460 B.C. of scenes from Perseus's life other than the slaying of Medusa or flight from the Gorgons has been thought to be due to a tetralogy on the Perseus story by Aes- chylus. The Pisticci krater dates to ca. 460 B.C. and, there- fore, is not only our earliest depiction of this rare myth, but it dates from the lifetime of Aeschylus. It is likely, therefore, that the scene on it, which follows the second or Aeschylean version of the story, may be due to the Phorkides, one of the plays of Aeschylus's lost tetralogy. THE SILENS OF NAXOS: Guy Michael Hedreen, Bryn Mawr College In the ancient sources and in art, some Silens were fol- lowers of Dionysos, but others were not. Scholars have thought that the Silens as a whole had nothing to do with Dionysos originally, and that at some point in the sixth century B.C. they entered into the following of Dionysos (F. Brommer, Satyroi [Wdirzburg 1937] 26). My research on Silens in Archaic Attic vase-painting has led to a different explanation of the relationship between Dionysos and Silens. One particular tribe of Silens appears to have been originally associated with Dionysos in myth, and this tribe was indigenous to the island of Naxos. It is not possible to specify when these Silens were attached to Dionysos, but it is very likely that the association is earlier than the sixth century. The evidence for a Naxian tribe of Silens is: 1) Silens are associated in Attic black-figure with the myths of Dionysos which were connected with Naxos: the return of Hephais- tos, a journey at sea, and the union of Dionysos and Ariadne. Prior to the period of satyr-play, the Silens do not accom- pany the god in other myths, such as the gigantomachy, or in gatherings of the gods. 2) Several cities issued coins with Silens in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., but the most im- portant series depicting Dionysos's Silens are the coins of Si- cilian Naxos. The island of Naxos may have produced an early sixth-century issue featuring the head of a Silen. One literary source refers to a spring of Silenos on Naxos. 3) A number of aspects of Dionysiac iconography in Attic black- figure, including the depiction of Silens making wine, have parallels in the festival of the Oschophoria. This festival was</page><page sequence="29">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 257 connected, in the etiological legend, with the myth of The- seus, Dionysos, and Ariadne on Naxos. The festival was founded or reorganized at some point after the first quarter of the sixth century. It is curious that Dionysiac imagery begins to appear after the first quarter of the sixth century in Attic black-figure, and it is not impossible that the festival was partly responsible for the rise and popularity of this imagery. DIONYSUS AND SEMELE: A NARRATIVE OF DRAMATIC CONTRASTS IN EARLY IMPERIAL SILVER: Jon Van de Grift, New York Society See AJA 90 (1986) 210. THE SILVER VESSELS FROM ROGOZEN: NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT THRACIAN RELIGION IN THE FOURTH CEN- TURY B.C.: Cornelia Ewigleben, Jesus College, Ox- ford University; University at Trier The Rogozen hoard was discovered in January 1986, in northwestern Bulgaria, formerly part of central Thrace (The New Thracian Treasure from Rogozen, Bulgaria [London 1986]). The hoard consists of 165 silver vessels, some gilded, dating from the beginning of the fourth century to the beginning of the third century B.C. Except for one beaker, one skyphos, and one plate, the vessels are all phia- lai, kalyx cups, and jugs. Unlike vessels previously found in this area, several of the objects from the Rogozen hoard are decorated with mythological scenes. These depictions repre- sent the largest amount of archaeological evidence to date about Thracian religious beliefs in pre-Roman times. The only written evidence consists of a few remarks by Greek authors (primarily Herodotus), made obscure by substitu- tion of Greek concepts for those that are uniquely Thracian. Six jugs, the plate, and the beaker are decorated with mythological reliefs. An analysis of the reliefs is given: they fall naturally into three distinct categories. The first has only one example, the relief on the plate. Its theme, the Heracles-Auge myth, as well as its stylistic execution, has no parallel in this region; it was probably made outside Thrace. The four examples comprising the second group demon- strate that the Thracians adapted Greek prototypes of an- thropomorphic gods, modified according to local belief. The three examples of the third group are hunting scenes and fantastic animals. These representations were locally devel- oped and are closely related to those depicted on objects al- ready found in central Thrace. PENTETERIS AND THE THREE HORAI IN THE POMPE OF PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS: Maria Teresa Marabini Moevs, Rutgers University The description of the Pompe, or great procession of Ptol- emy Philadelphus in the stadium of Alexandria, given by Callixenus of Rhodes (third century B.C.) and transmitted in Athenaeus's Deipnosophistai, is considered a major docu- ment for the reconstruction of the life of the city, particularly religious and artistic life, during its "Golden Age." No ex- tant representations of it have been recorded so far. Now, however, the head figures of the Dionysiac section of the procession, precisely three Horai, Penteteris (the "Five- Year Span" of the Ptolemaia Festival) and possibly Eniautos (the Year Cycle) have been identified on the basis of extant copies, mostly of the first century B.C., derived from lost graphic documentations of the event. The iconography of these figures testifies to the encounter of three identifiable traditions and ultimately to the amal- gamation of three religious conceptions: Pharaonic, Greek (Archaic and Classical), and Ptolemaic. In the Horai, the sixth century B.C. Greek mythological tradition of the gift- bearing divinities encounters a comparable Egyptian visual- ization of the Seasons bringing gifts to the solar deity. The providential character of the Egyptian Seasons suggests in turn an influence of indigenous beliefs on the evolution of the significance of the Horai in the early Hellenistic period. The attributes of the Horai, representing with faithful ad- herence to reality the major economic resources of Ptolemaic Egypt, emphasize the political aspect of their cult in Alex- andria, and ultimately its relation to the Archaic conception of the Horai as Eunomia (Good Government), Dike (Right), and Eirene (Peace), daughters of Zeus and Themis. Penteteris, in her iconographic fidelity to the ritual of the great Panhellenic festivals, confirms the isolympic character of the Ptolemaia. SESSION IV C: COLLOQUIUM: THE PHRY- GIANS THE KINGDOM OF PHRYGIA: AN OVERVIEW: Machteld J. Mellink, Bryn Mawr College The kingdom of Phrygia is the first to take leadership in Western Anatolia after the Dark Ages. King Midas-Mita can be associated with a dynastic center in Gordion at a stra- tegic crossing of the Sangarios River. Alphabetic inscriptions in the Phrygian language indicate the range of Phrygian expansion. The language shows the Phrygians to be Iron Age newcomers from the Balkans (Thrace). Gordion is the type-site for the blending of old Western Anatolian traditions with new European features. The citadel and megara are of Western Anatolian type; the timber graves and tumuli are newly introduced from Europe. The organization of the new kingdom must have been based on an old road system along which fortresses were rebuilt by the Phrygians, e.g., Yenidogan ca. 20 km. east of Gordion and the citadel of the former Hittite capital Hattusha. Political and economic ties were developed with the Lu- vian kings of Tabal, Tyana (Warpalawas), Carchemish, and with the kings of Urartu. Midas-Mita is presumably concerned with the mineral wealth of the Taurus Moun- tains in his attempts to enter Cilicia in rivalry with Sargon of Assyria.</page><page sequence="30">258 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 DENDROCHRONOLOGY AND CARBON DATING OF PHRYGIAN SITES: Peter Kuniholm, Cornell Univer- sity The 806-year tree-ring sequence from the Midas Mound Tumulus at Gordion, although still not connected to an ab- solutely dated dendrochronological curve, has now been suc- cessfully wiggle-matched with the European high-precision calibration curve. All 18 out of 18 14C determinations fit the calibration curve. The last preserved ring, which we also think is the terminal ring, which grew before the wood was cut is 776?20 B.C. The innermost ring is thus 1582?20 B.C. The Gordion ring-sequence will therefore be a chrono- logical pin, not only for Iron Age structures but also for Late Bronze Age structures elsewhere in Anatolia. A number of pieces of wood from the City Mound at Gordion that have been matched with the Midas Mound Tumulus chronology yield the relative dates for those struc- tures. In some cases wood was demonstrably reused as much as 400 or 500 years after it was cut. THE EARLY PHRYGIAN PERIOD AT GORDION: TO- WARD A CULTURAL IDENTITY: G. Kenneth Sams, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill The Early Phrygian period at Gordion is a multi-phased unit of time that spans from obscure beginnings in the Ana- tolian Dark Age to the destruction of an impressive citadel, presumably that of Midas, ca. 700 B.C. By the end of the period, Phrygian culture had entered what might be con- sidered its mature or classical stage, as witnessed primarily by the contents of tombs and the rich material record of the destroyed citadel. At least a degree of literacy had been at- tained, while Midas himself had become an international figure. Like most complex societies, that of the Phrygians during this period seems to have incorporated a variety of strains and components that together created a unique cultural sig- nature, and Gordion stands as the key site for analyzing the Phrygian ethnogenesis. The southeast European back- ground of the Phrygians, as stated by Classical authors and implied by linguistic affinities, finds archaeological support at Gordion, and the evidence, largely ceramic, points to more than a single influx from the Balkan world. The rela- tionship, if any, between the earliest European immigrants, recognized by handmade pottery with general Thracian connections, and the local, Late Bronze Age population is unclear; but the evidence of pottery, and perhaps building techniques, could point to a process of acculturation from which Phrygian civilization in Anatolia arose. Although the Phrygians appear to have maintained a European identity, they also came to be active participants in the Syro-Ana- tolian community of the ninth and eighth centuries, as re- flected by a variety of material goods and by certain archi- tectural practices, including the use of relief orthostates. The nature of Phrygia's relations with the Greek world is diffi- cult to ascertain, and it is possible that a cultural dialogue did not begin until relatively late in the period. The tradi- tion of Midas's activities in the West and the likely Phrygian modification of the Greek alphabet suggest more than casual contact, while the Phrygian fondness for the meander prob- ably reflects a degree of artistic influence from Greece. As naturalized Anatolians, the Phrygians themselves ap- pear to have contributed much, either inherited or locally formulated, to their own cultural profile. The Phrygian character is particularly apparent in the forms and decora- tion of pottery and other materials, and in architecture, where a refined tradition of building in soft limestone may be as old as the ninth century. PHRYGIAN ORTHOSTAT RELIEFS FOUND IN ANKARA: Sevim Buluq, Middle East Technical University Since the end of the 19th century, 10 orthostat reliefs de- picting lions, sphinxes, griffins, a horse, and a bull, as well as two Kybele reliefs, have been discovered. The reliefs were found at different times in various unrelated locations with- in the city of Ankara. Although the style of these reliefs has received much at- tention since their discovery, their architectural nature has not yet been convincingly analyzed. These reliefs are the best examples of the little-known Phrygian architectural sculpture. If these 12 reliefs are reexamined with a new ap- proach, some suggestions can be made about their use. Despite their different findspots, the animal figures on the 10 orthostat reliefs show stylistic similarities. Several scholars have suggested that they might be orthostats be- longing to a single building. H. Giiterbock proposed that the animal reliefs, as well as the two Kybele reliefs, may all have belonged to a single shrine of Kybele. The reliefs were found over a large area, however, and instead of belonging to one shrine, they may have belonged to a number of Kybele shrines or monuments. Their findspots suggest that most f the reliefs may have been associated with the Phrygian tu- muli in the Ankara necropolis, while others seem to belong to shrines built within the Phrygian city. THE PHRYGIAN ARTISTIC INTELLECT: Elizabeth Simp- son, Metropolitan Museum of Art Phrygian art of the eighth century B.C., represented by the finds excavated at Gordion, is distinguished by its in- novative design, lively figural style, and careful execution- with meticulous attention to detail. These characteristics are evident in works in all media, including bronze vessels, belts, and fibulas, as well as fine painted pottery and small- scale sculpture. Different styles apparent within each medi- um seem related to chronological progression, although this is often difficult to determine with certainty. Despite stylistic differences, however, the art of Gordion remains recogniz- ably Phrygian. The wooden furniture from the city mound and three early tumuli at Gordion, with its ingenious design, unusual forms, and dazzling inlay, seems the perfect embodiment of Phrygian taste as we know it. A closer look, however, tells us more about Phrygian art than we could ever learn from</page><page sequence="31">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 259 works in other media. Symmetry and sequential coinci- dence, basic to Phrygian design, receive surprising treat- ment on the wooden furniture. Symmetry and sequence are used and then broken up. Designs are consciously con- structed using very specific types of symmetry, and these de- signs may be rotated and flipped to form new designs de- rived from the originals. Underlying patterns can be found for groups of designs that appear random; these seem to con- stitute puzzles, of varying degrees of complexity. Certain de- signs are real puzzles in themselves-carefully constructed mazes of several types. Many of the furniture's forms can be identified as ab- stractions of natural forms, extending even into the realm of what seems to be religious symbolism. And an amazing af- finity for spatial geometry is reflected by the representation of three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. The Gor- dion furniture, then, by the luck of its preservation, gives us a special look at the artistic intellect of some very unusual ancient artists. And the intellect of these artists certainly, to some extent, must reflect that of the members of the Phry- gian aristocracy who commissioned and appreciated the art- ists' work. PHRYGIAN MYTH AND CULT: Lynn E. Roller, Univer- sity of California, Davis Phrygian religious tradition was among the most endur- ing legacies of the Phrygians to the Greek and Roman world, and thus repays careful investigation. When, how- ever, we try to determine what the Phrygians' cult practices actually were, we find ourselves on very shadowy ground. The few Phrygian epigraphical texts which can be read in- dicate the existence of a female divinity whose name was simply matar, or Mother, occasionally qualified by the epi- thet kubileya. Many Phrygian representations of this divin- ity are known. They display striking regional characteris- tics, suggesting that the goddess's cult was not uniform throughout central Anatolia. Through their frequency and variety, they testify to the enormous popularity of the Ana- tolian Mother goddess, the Greek Kybele, a divinity whose worship precedes the advent of the Phrygians into Anatolia and, in Hellenized form, outlives their existence as a distinct people. No other Phrygian divinity is known. Phrygian myth is even more difficult to pinpoint. No works of Phrygian art depict mythological narrative, a cir- cumstance which probably reflects the lack of interest in narrative art rather than a lack of myth. Several Greek leg- ends purport to record Phrygian mythical tradition, such as the story of the Gordian knot or the legend of Attis. If read from an Anatolian perspective, such legends show that close ties existed between the Mother goddess and individual Phrygian rulers. After the end of Phrygian political inde- pendence, the role of these human rulers, such as Midas and Attis, was subsumed in Greek accounts into the position of mythical consorts of the Mother. GORDION AND PHRYGIA IN THE SIXTH CENTURY B.C.: Keith DeVries, University of Pennsylvania Phrygian culture of the sixth century was marked on the one hand by a reverent looking back to the age of Midas. The citadel of Gordion was painstakingly rebuilt to have nearly the same layout as that of ca. 700 B.C., and inscrip- tions on the "Midas Monument" in the Phrygian highlands indicate that Midas had become a figure of worship. On the other hand, the culture was in a dynamic, flour- ishing phase. Literacy was far more widespread than it had been in the Midas period; economically, there may have been a shift to an increased use of gold, silver, and electrum; and the sculpture, painting, and architecture of the time are impressive and are far from being locked into past modes. PHRYGIAN GORDION IN THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD: Frederick A. Winter, Brooklyn College The large-scale excavations conducted by the University of Pennsylvania at Gordion between 1950 and 1974 provide extensive data to illustrate developments in Phrygia during the early Hellenistic era. In a period marked by historically documented foreign political conquests, the archaeological remains from Gordion indicate the presence of a persistent native tradition that was, despite its strong native base, open to foreign imports and influences. Historically, the period begins with Alexander's famous visit in 334/333 B.C. and the change in Phrygia from Per- sian to Graeco-Macedonian domination. Then, in ca. 275 B.C., control of Phrygia shifted to new military occupiers, the Celtic Galatians. In 189 B.C., when a Roman punitive expedition marched through Phrygia against the Celts, Gor- dion was abandoned and not reoccupied until Roman Im- perial times. There is little reason to suppose that the forementioned changes in Gordion's political affiliations were accompanied by similarly drastic shifts in its actual human population. Despite the adoption at Gordion of the Greek language and the presence in the archaeological record of other possible indications of Greeks living at the site, as well as the exis- tence of one locally produced bowl that has been found in- scribed with a Celtic name, possibly an owner's signature, the archaeological remains from Gordion demonstrate that there was strong continuity between pre-Hellenistic and Hellenistic times. Tumulus burials continue to be used by the site's elite and Gordion's ceramic assemblage reflects the long-established Phrygian preference for reduction-fired gray wares. Foreign influences, as contrasted to foreign residents, are clearly present and trade with the Greek West appears to have been continuous throughout the period, except during a relatively brief time immediately following the Celtic ar- rival (ca. 275 to 240 B.C.). The trade goods, however, seem to have been selected with traditional Phrygian tastes in mind (Greek black glazed wares corresponding to local gray pottery, Greek terracotta figurines depicting the Phrygian deity Cybele), and thus the imports found at Gordion join other evidence in reflecting a vigorous and active traditional Phrygian population during the early Hellenistic era.</page><page sequence="32">260 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 SESSION IV D: COLLOQUIUM: FUTURE CUR- RENTS IN AQUEDUCT STUDIES MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS IN ANCIENT AQUEDUCTS: Henning Fahlbusch, Ltibeck Aqueducts are damaged either from outside (willful de- struction, roots, etc.) or from inside (sediments, calcareous fall-outs). Willful destruction has occurred at all times. To prevent damage from tree roots, planting trees along the aqueducts has sometimes been prohibited. Damage resulting from sediments inside the aqueducts could often be repaired by flushing them. In cases where cal- careous water was carried in the aqueducts (especially to Roman cities), deposits of lime carbonate formed a firm crust of sinter on the walls. In time the increasing crust narrowed the discharge cross-sections. However, the crust only caused an increase in the water level as long as the duct was a free-flow channel with a clearance much larger than the discharge section. The discharge capacity of the aqueduct was not diminished, especially when the crust was removed from time to time. Frontinus reports on such repairs to the aqueducts of Rome. At least five phases of sinter-removal have been documented for the Roman aqueduct for Aspendos. The crusts caused trouble in pressure-pipelines, how- ever, as the discharge capacity of the aqueducts was con- tinuously reduced by the narrowing clearance and the in- creasing roughness. If a city was supplied via a pressure- pipeline, regular control of the calcareous crust was neces- sary. This could be done mechanically. Yet the duct had to be disassembled to chisel out the firm deposits, thus causing a long interruption in the supply. The other possibility was the chemical prevention of a thick crust by means of acid. In Roman times, hot vinegar was probably used to maintain the pressurized stone-pipelines against sinter. THE ROLE OF AQUEDUCTS IN NEAR EASTERN WATER- SUPPLY SYSTEMS: John P. Oleson, University of Victoria Large-scale aqueduct systems are a feature of most Rom- an arrangements for urban water-supply. In the West these systems often seem to have filled virtually the entire demand of the population they served. In the eastern Mediterranean, however, pre-Roman and non-Roman aqueduct systems of- ten were only subsidiary in character. Greek and Nabataean settlements, for example, in addition to open-channel and pressurized water conduits, relied on cisterns, wells, and seepages for much of their water. The survey and excavation of Humayma, a Nabataean habitation center in southern Jordan, have provided data illustrating the multifarious character of the water system serving a modest population of farmers, herders, and tradesmen in a very arid environment (less than 80 mm. of rain a year). A combination of local and imported techniques allowed a community to flourish des- pite apparently hostile surroundings. Although many of the water-harvesting techniques at the site are the result of cen- turies of local experience, the scale of the aqueduct and the design of vaulted cistern roofs reveal the effect of Graeco- Roman technology. Appropriate social mechanisms evolved to distribute the different types of water collected. Local water sources may also have played a significant role in smaller Roman communities in the Roman West. MODERN INSIGHTS FROM THE STUDY OF ANCIENT GREEK WATER MANAGEMENT: Dora P. Crouch, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Until now, no one has studied ancient Greek water sup- ply as a coherent system. Indeed, the concept is unheard of. An urban system is a regularly interacting or interdepen- dent group of items forming a unified whole in an urban setting, such as school system or park system. (A system need not be planned as a whole in order to function as a whole.) This study questions the water arrangements that made urbanization possible in the Greek world; suggests what knowledge can be extracted from a particular site; and points to further investigations. Using Morgantina as a case study, this paper examines Greek water management in terms of the traditional evalua- tion of a site for water potential; utilization of particular wa- ter resources; distribution of water resources in the city plan; and supply and usage as interactive variables. The study draws on Classical archaeology, urban history, geology, hy- draulic engineering, and sociology. In conclusion, the sophistication of Greek water know- ledge is compared with the oblivion of our response to water issues. Because of their constraints the Greeks seem to have worked out a cost-benefit analysis that led to ecological bal- ance (water was returned to as well as extracted from the immediate environment). Without these skills in water management, Greek urbanization could not have flourished as it did during the eighth to first centuries B.C. A number of lessons are implicit: closer attention to society-wide cost- benefit analysis, awareness of resource constraints, and al- location of the appropriate quality water to each usage. Investigation is needed into the hydrogeological base for water supply and hence for the development of urbanization. My study incorporates much of this information, but would benefit from parallel interdisciplinary studies investigating urban location and water use in other times and places. AN ADMINISTRATOR'S HYDRAULICS: FRONTINUS AQ. 35-36.2: R.H. Rodgers, New Haven Frontinus's handbook on the aqueducts of Rome has been alternately overrated and underrated as a source for understanding Roman hydraulic science. His focus was on administrative rather than technical matters, and his com- ments on the latter must therefore be examined with special care. Silence is by no means to be equated with ignorance, and vagueness need represent neither Frontinus's per- sonal uncertainty nor the limits of contemporary scientific understanding. Chapters 35-36 of the De Aquae Ductu illustrate this problem. The passage appears as part of Frontinus's ex- planatory comments on the standardized series of lead pipes.</page><page sequence="33">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 261 Under certain circumstances, Frontinus states, pipe-size will not suffice accurately to indicate the amount (modus) of water conveyed. He mentions the two factors of head (pres- sura) and resistance (segnitia ductus) as well as the position of the pipe relative to the flow of current in the main aque- duct channel. Does he recognize the specific hydraulic prin- ciples at work here, or is his understanding loose and em- pirical? He mentions the possibility of making adjustments to compensate for special conditions. As to how such adjust- ments were made he is vague and tantalizing: what does he mean by "burdening" or "relieving"? He is equally unclear on reasons for adjustment: was it intended to ensure uni- formity in delivery? Answers (mine at least) can be no more than speculative. Context, however, makes plain Frontinus's real point. Underlings on the staff were alert to every opportunity for personal profit, and the chief administrator must be no less alert to those areas where fraudulent behavior might be expected. In some respects, it would seem, the hydraulics of the system invited fraud-a fact Frontinus wishes to call to his readers' attention precisely because it would be anything but apparent to non-specialists. WATER DISTRIBUTION: QUORSUM ET CUI BONo? Harry B. Evans, Fordham University Rome's aqueducts provide testimony to the engineering genius and organizational skills which met vital needs of the citizenry. Even more valuable is the evidence they furnish for the growth and development of the city itself. We will never replace the studies of Ashby and Van Deman on the conduits outside the city, nor can we recon- struct Rome's delivery system with the detail possible in simpler systems like that at Pompeii. Nevertheless our evi- dence from different sources (physical remains, Frontinus, and recent advances in Roman topographical study) permits us to understand in good part how Rome's water system de- veloped and how individual lines served particular needs. Two aqueducts, one early and one late, illustrate these points. Rome's first line, the Aqua Appia of 312 B.C., was introduced to supply the area of the Republican port near the Tiber and Circus Maximus. Its delivery as recorded by Frontinus was relatively small because of its low level, but it met the needs for which it was introduced and remained in use well into the Empire. Quite different was the Aqua Traiana, introduced in A.D. 109, when Rome had acquired much greater hydraulic expertise. Because this line was built a decade after Fron- tinus, we know little about its capacity and distribution. Its height at its entry made possible its delivery into all 14 ur- ban regions, a fact confirmed by inscriptional evidence. The Aqua Traiana is an example of much more sophisticated planning, introduced both to meet the needs of the Trans- tiber, into which it was brought, and to provide backup sup- plies throughout the city. By the time Rome had reached its greatest size, its water commissioners had developed sys- tematic planning to make most efficient use of an essential resource. SESSION IV E: POSTER SESSION II DISCOVERING ETRURIA IN THE 20TH CENTURY: Gen- naro F. Pasquariello, Narragansett Society The Etruscans were an ancient civilization whose history reveals that they inhabited the Italian peninsula from 1000 B.C. to 100 B.C. They settled and developed villages and cities in the territory of Italy that is referred to as Etruria. There are 20 modern geographical regions in Italy. The regions that contain the majority of Etruscan sites are: Lom- bardia, Emilia-Romagna, Toscana, Umbria, Lazio, and Campania. In this poster session, I present computerized multicolor drawings of these regions. These drawings will demonstrate the geographical relationships of the regions to their sur- rounding boundaries; the location of major Etruscan cities, sites, and museums within the areas involved; demonstrate the relative position of the access routes and measured dis- tances to the various locations from the major city in the re- gion; and list the artifacts available for viewing. MICROANALYSIS OF LATE ROMAN PERIOD MOSAIC GLASS BEADS: Ann M. Stout, Macalester College For the first time, to the author's knowledge, exceedingly small fragments of glass from late Roman mosaic glass-face beads have been successfully analyzed by plasma emission spectrometry. The archaeological context and iconograph- ical subject matter of these mosaic glass beads with faces were previously presented at the 85th General Meeting of the AIA (AJA 88 [1984] 261-62). Glass fragments including red, blue, white, yellow, and turquoise colors were first analyzed by electron microprobe. Results showed heterogeneity from reading to reading, es- pecially for lead. Next, a technique allowing individual grains of glass as small as 0.2 micrograms to be analyzed was followed for direct current, plasma emission spectrometry. The accuracy of the technique is documented by analyses of three Corning Glass standards. The combined analyses show that the mosaic glass beads have Na20-Si02-CaO compositions within the range of Roman glasses in the first four centuries A.C. The red glasses are particularly interesting with MgO and K20 over 2 weight % and P205 over 1% suggesting that plant ash was added to the glass batch for one of the alkalies. CuO above 2 weight % was responsible for the red color. PbO and SnO were probably added as opacifiers. DIAMONDS FOR DRILLING AND ENGRAVING IN THE AN- CIENT WORLD: Leonard Gorelick and A. John Gwinnett, State University of New York at Stony Brook Evidence is presented that quartz beads excavated in Mantai, Sri Lanka, by Carswell, dated ca. A.D. 700-1000, and beads from Arikamedu in Southeast India, ca. 250 B.C.-</page><page sequence="34">262 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 A.D. 300, were drilled with natural diamond splinters. Our proof is based on a comparison of the pattern found in the drill holes of quartz beads from present-day Cambay, India where it is known that diamond drills are used. In addition, we were able to produce experimentally an identical drilling pattern. All the examples cited were analyzed by means of silicone impressions and scanning electron microscopy. Evi- dence for the use of diamond drills in the ancient world has not been previously reported. Further evidence is given that Roman gem engravers used diamonds from India for gem engraving. In part this conclusion is based on the Periplus and on the writings of Pliny the Elder, Solinus, and the Arthra-Sastra. ON THE VALUE OF SILICONE IMPRESSIONS TO THE FIELD ARCHAEOLOGIST: A. John Gwinnett and Leo- nard Gorelick, State University of New York at Stony Brook The purpose of this exhibit is to explain and demonstrate the value of silicone impressions for the study of ancient lapidary. It is complementary to our presentation showing that diamonds were used in the ancient world for drilling and engraving. The ability to use silicone impressions may be of particular value to field archaeologists, who more and more are prohibited from taking lapidary artifacts from museums and from foreign excavations back to the labora- tory for study. Original findings based on the use of silicone impressions on artifacts of several ancient cultures are shown. SESSION V A: ROMAN PROVINCES ROMAN AND ISLAMIC AKHMIM: EVIDENCE OF POTTERY STATISTICS: Sheila McNally, University of Minne- sota, Minneapolis The pottery from Akhmim in Upper Egypt (recovered in two excavations financed by the Graduate School of the University of Minnesota and the National Endowment for the Humanities) ranges from Pharaonic to 19th century, but this report concentrates on its contribution to our under- standing of the transition from Late Roman (i.e., Coptic or Byzantine) to the Islamic periods, approximately from the sixth to the 10th century. The excavations have indicated a general continuity in material culture, a continuity demon- strated particularly strikingly by the pottery statistics. More than 5000 kg. of pottery have been typed, weighed, and counted, and more than 800 kg. have been catalogued (a continuing process). The percentages of imported fine wares indicate that, except for a brief decline just at the time of the Islamic conquest, the level of prosperity remained high. The studies indicate a change in trade patterns. Trade with Lower Egypt declined, while pottery imports from Upper Egypt, apparently from Aswan, increased in both percen- tage and variety. Aswan continued to produce its traditional fine slipped products, and also introduced new painted wares. These wares appear shortly after the Islamic con- quest. They do not reflect specifically Islamic forms or tech- niques, but a new spirit of adventure and innovation. This Aswan production is discussed in greater detail by Ivantica Schrunk. My concern is with the relative place of these wares in the statistical picture of the Akhmim pottery inven- tory. A strikingly new and specifically Islamic pottery type, the glazed ware from Fustat, makes its first appearance in the ninth century, in the Tulamid period. Although this ware again contributes to a changed picture of trade rela- tionships, it does not drive out the traditional imports from Aswan. Those fine slipped products have generally been classified as variants of "Late Roman Red," having been studied pri- marily at cities or monastic sites that came to an end at or before the Islamic conquest, presenting what now appears to be a seriously incomplete picture of the production. The introduction of Islamic glazed wares has been traced most clearly by George Scanlon's work at the new Muslim site of Fustat. His work first showed that the so-called Roman wares continued to be produced. In Akhmim they appear for a still longer period, and in greater variety. Our results can now be placed into a broader context due to the monumental publicaton by William Y. Adams in 1986 of pottery found in Nubia. Adams discusses all the major Egyptian types, pro- posing an overall system of production centers. Akhmim also yielded these major wares, although in a different chrono- logical framework, and supplemented by some presumably local variants. It is the only Egyptian site at which the whole transitional process can be traced. THE ASWAN WARE AT AKHMIM, EGYPT: Ivancica Dvorz'ak Schrunk, Macalester College Fine red-slipped pottery made at Aswan is the most com- mon find in Upper Egypt throughout the whole of the post- pharaonic period. It stemmed from the Roman terra sigil- lata traditions and was mass-produced in the late Roman period, when it closely followed the developments of the con- temporary red-slipped pottery of North Africa. While Ro- man traditons of red-slipped pottery died out soon after the end of the Roman period in the Mediterranean countries, the Aswan wares showed a remarkable longevity in Upper Egypt and Nubia. Akhmim is the only site in Upper Egypt where the total recovery of late Roman and Islamic pottery from two 4-m.2 trenches offered a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the Aswan wares. The two seasons of excavations in 1978 and 1981 were directed by Sheila McNally of the University of Minnesota and supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The only comprehensive study of the Aswan wares to date is that by William Y. Adams on the material from Nubia. While we can distin- guish at Akhmim the same ware groups as in Nubia and can follow their technical and stylistic changes, the chronology and persi.tence of some types at Akhmim differs. Smoothly polished red-slipped ware (Adams's Group AII) continues well into the Mamluke period and coexists from the early Islamic period on with a coarser version of this ware</page><page sequence="35">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 263 (Adams's Groups AIII and AIV). The white-slipped Aswan ware appears in the seventh-century levels and is common until about the 11 th century. The painted Aswan ware was less popular at Akhmim than in Nubia, although cream- slipped examples occurred earlier. Several other non-Aswan red- and cream-slipped wares, imitating Aswan vessel shapes, occurred in most periods. ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT MYOs HORMOS, EGYPT, CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF DELA- WARE: Steven E. Sidebotham, University of Dela- ware Surveying, planning, mapping, and excavation at 'Abu Sha'ar/Deir Umm Deheis/Bir 'Abu Sha'ar shed new light on the archaeology and history of this region of Egypt's Eastern Desert-Red Sea littoral. Long considered the loca- tion of Myos Hormos-one of the the cities engaged in com- merce with South Arabia and India-investigations here re- vealed no ancient port city, but, rather (according to numis- matic and ceramic evidence) a fifth-seventh century A.C. fort in excellent condition. Inside the ca. 77.5 x 64 m. en- ceinte dotted by 12 to 13 square or rectangular towers and pierced by two arched gateways were barracks, storage magazines, an administrative building, and an apsed edifice, which may have served as the praetoria. The fort-only ca. 30 m. from the Red Sea-was visited by Wilkinson, Wellsted, and Burton in the 19th century, described and, in one instance, imprecisely mapped. Addi- tional visits to the region have been made and recorded in this century by Murray, Scaife, Meredith, Kraus, and others. Until the present work, however, no detailed map of the area nor accurate plan of the fort had been drawn, no scientific excavations conducted, nor a date established for the fort. A putative bath complex lay outside the north gate and this, together with other subsidiary structures of contempo- rary date, but unknown function, north, west, and south- west of the fort were also plotted and/or planned. The survey also planned a smaller hydreuma (fortified water station) near a natural well about 5 km. west of the fort. Analysis of the pottery showed the hydreuma to be con- temporary with the fort, viz., fifth to seventh century A.C. THE JOINT EXCAVATIONS AT MT. KOSMAJ, YUGOSLA- VIA: PRELIMINARY REPORT ON 1986, 1987 SEASONS: Michael R. Werner, The University of Albany, State University of New York The purpose of the Mt. Kosmaj Project is the examina- tion of the processes of Roman occupation of this part of Moesia Superior during the Empire. Because of the intense exploitation of its mineral resources, this was an exceptional province, and significant among the results of this research is a clearer understanding of the methods by which the min- ing industry was organized and maintained. The region oc- cupies an area of approximately 5 km.2 and is located 40 km. to the south of Belgrade. The sites investigated include a major civilian settlement (Gradiite), a peripheral cemetery (Reka), and a series of mining and ore-processing locations (Pruten valley). Roman occupation runs through the Em- pire and is represented by a pattern of dispersed settlement and burial sites loosely grouped around a cohort base and larger settlement. On the basis of two newly discovered altar dedications, there were both Greek- and Latin-speaking ele- ments among the population. Activity centered around min- ing, where lead-silver and iron ores were extracted, and pro- cessing locations, where with the use of an iron flux a lead- silver product was produced in the primary smelting stage. Ore extraction consisted of a basic system of surface ore identification and subterranean excavation of ore veins. The author and the project director, Vladimir Kondia (Archaeo- logical Institute, Belgrade) gratefully acknowledge the col- laboration of John Merkel, project archaeometallurgist, and funding from Earthwatch and the Center for Field Re- search, the Yugoslav-American Joint Fund under the aus- pices of the Smithsonian Institution, and the SUNY-Albany Research Foundation. EXCAVATIONS AT GORSIUM-HERCULIA IN HUNGARY: Janos Fedak, University of Toronto The establishment of Gorsium near the eastern limes of the Roman Empire dates back to the time of Emperor Claudius between A.D. 46-49. The earliest settlement was a military camp and its canabae. From this initial outpost situated at an important strategic position, a wealthy city developed which flourished for four centuries of Roman rule. Organized fieldwork at Gorsium-Herculia (modern Tac) started in 1958 under the direction of Fitz Jen6 and has so far uncovered about 28% of the Roman town within the city walls. Our team began excavation in July 1987 in the northeast section of the city, in a location determined by a 1959 son- dage which had located a paved floor and a series of bronze bells about 2.20 m. below the present surface. The stratification of the site was disturbed by World War II trenches and by roots. The first undisturbed layer yielded numerous fallen tile fragments below which an Avar ceme- tery was discovered. Four skeletons and two more skulls came to light in the process of the excavation. One skeleton of a male (1.70 m. tall) was found with grave offerings in- tact: a 17.5 cm. high clay jug decorated with geometric pat- terns on its exterior, an iron dagger next to the right hand, and an iron belt buckle over the middle of the pelvis. A series of late Roman walls and sections of pavements emerged in the last days of the excavation. The largest wall in Trench 250/735 is 0.80 m. thick and has a plastered and painted surface on its inner side. The small finds include a bronze bell, probably belonging to a set of four similar but larger bells found in 1959, and a series of four pebbles of different sizes. Each pebble was split in half and the cut sur- faces were smoothed for some as yet unknown reason. The trenches also yielded numerous imported and locally made terra sigillata pieces, broken glass fragments, and a partially preserved stamped Roman building brick.</page><page sequence="36">264 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME EXCAVATIONS AT OPPI- DO MAMERTINA (CALABRIA), 1987: Paolo Visonar, University of Notre Dame In 1984-1986 an electro-magnetic resistivity survey and test excavations conducted by the Archaeological Superin- tendency of Calabria in an olive grove at contrada Mella, near Oppido Mamertina (ca. 80 km. north of Reggio Cala- bria) revealed substantial remains of a settlement of the Hellenistic period. The discovery of several brickstamps bearing the Oscan ethnic TAYRIANOYM in Greek letters identified the settlers as the Taurianoi, an Italic people known to Classical authors. The 1987 season focused on the central area of the site. Excavation uncovered extensive portions of a large urban complex laid out in an orthogonal pattern along a north- east-southwest axis and intersected by a pebble road. On its northern side, two rooms belonging to a rectangular build- ing of as yet undetermined dimensions and functions were partially exposed. Their unmortared walls consisted of river cobbles and sandstone blocks laid in regular fashion and framed with tile fragments. The structures on the southern side represent the foundation walls of at least seven rectan- gular rooms, which may have served utilitarian as well as domestic functions, as the presence of storage pithoi would indicate. A debris layer from the room located directly to the south of the pebble road yielded two terracotta revetment plaques, each decorated with a star in relief within a border of dots, which may be unprecedented. A preliminary study of both the pottery and the coins re- covered thus far would suggest that the site had a relatively short life span, and may have been abandoned toward the end of the second century B.C. The coins, in particular, consist mainly of Mamertine bronze issues. Their concen- tration and numbers are unparalleled at other sites in the Calabria region, and may attest to a relationship between Mamertines and Taurianoi which will have to be clarified by future work. The limited period of occupation of the site makes the archaeological record especially significant for the reconstruction of the development of an Italic commu- nity before and after the Romanization of this area of an- cient Bruttium. CONTINUITY IN PRE-ROMAN TO ROMAN SARDINIAN SETTLEMENT: THE 1987 MARYLAND-WESLEYAN SURVEY: Stephen Dyson, Wesleyan University, and Robert Rowland, University of Maryland The transition from the pre-Roman to the Roman period in rural Sardinia is important to students of Romanization. Sardinia was a major supplier of grain and pastoral prod- ucts. Its population offered a prolonged resistance, however, and Roman control in the interior areas was always tenu- ous. This combination of strong Roman needs and limited control makes a detailed understanding of rural settlement during Romanization important. Information, however, is very limited. Literary sources are few and rural archaeo- logical remains have not been systematically reported or studied. Detailed Roman period surveys do not exist. To provide such information, the University of Mary- land and Wesleyan University conducted the 1987 survey in the territory of Baulado in west-central Sardinia. Baulado is located at the juncture of coastal plain and interior hill coun- try near the modern city of Oristano and the ancient city of Tharros. The territory is rich in nuragic remains, but few Roman finds had been reported. Our survey centered on nu- ragic sites to investigate evidence for Roman continuity and on selected lowland areas to find villa settlements. Over 40 sites from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Early Mediaeval period were investigated. Nearly all sites that produced nu- ragic pottery also produced Roman material, suggesting strong settlement continuity. In contrast, extensive field walking in the lowlands produced no villa sites. This sug- gests that Romanization around Baulado meant incorpora- tion into the Roman market system, but little shift in rural settlement pattern and social organization. This contrasts with other western provinces where a strong villa economy emerged. The survey not only provided new insight into the Romanization process but also demonstrated the potential of survey in areas with heavy ground cover. THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA EXCAVATIONS AT CAR- THAGE, THE 1987 SEASON: Naomi J. Norman, Uni- versity of Georgia The University of Georgia Excavations at Carthage con- tinued for the fourth season in the Roman circus. In 1987, we focused on three areas: the circus arena, the cavea, and the area immediately outside the circus. Excavation in the cavea suggests that the seating was built in two phases. The second phase lengthened and deepened the cavea, thus sub- stantially increasing the seating capacity; this phase belongs to the Severan period. Excavation outside the circus uncov- ered a large and important dump of third-century pottery, which is perhaps to be associated with leveling outside the circus for the Severan enlargement of the cavea. Also in 1987, new work in the arena proper confirmed a relatively long period of use for the arena surfaces. It also revealed two massive robber trenches running at an oblique angle to the 'podium wall of the cavea. The placement and orientation of the two trenches suggest that the walls robbed by these trenches may belong to the carceres of an earlier phase of the circus. At least one of the walls was robbed in the Severan period, suggesting that the carceres may have been disman- tled and the arena then lengthened as part of the Severan rebuilding of the circus. A LATE ROMAN WELL AT SARDIS: Marcus Rautman, University of Missouri-Columbia Recent exploration of Late Roman Sardis has revealed in the western city a residential quarter with colonnaded streets and densely built peristyle houses. A deep well set in the court of one such residence was identified by the Har- vard-Cornell Expedition in 1982 and excavated in 1985. The well's installation required cutting through the paved Roman floor as well as 6.0 m. of Archaic Lydian monumen- tal architecture to a total depth of 22.5 m. Modest quantities</page><page sequence="37">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 265 of stratified material recovered from its shaft provide a date in the mid-sixth century for the undertaking. Despite the great effort involved in its construction, the new well was used only briefly before being filled with dumped building debris toward the end of the century. The appearance of this well in its domestic context sig- nals important changes in the urban history of the site. At the time of their development, the western neighborhoods were equipped with an elaborate network of pipes and con- duits that supplied baths, fountains, and domestic basins. The polis maintained and expanded this system throughout the fifth century, but later years saw a shift from the city's centralized water supply to scattered wells and cisterns. Similar changes in the availability and use of water have been observed in both public and private contexts in other excavated sectors of the site. Whether these problems origi- nated in its Claudian-era aqueduct or its urban distribution network, the city apparently lacked the resources and per- haps the need to attend its repair. When considered in its larger setting, the evidence at Sardis reflects serious struc- tural problems that undermined the prosperity of the Late Roman city several generations before its supposed destruc- tion in the seventh century. INVESTIGATIONS AT ANEMURIUM, 1982-1987: James Russell, University of British Columbia Since 1982 there have been three short seasons of work at Anemurium (Eski Anamur) where Canadian excavations have been in progress since the mid-sixties. Two of these seasons (1982 and 1985) have been devoted largely to the exploration of the largest of the city's four early Christian churches. Erected probably in the second quarter of the fifth century, the church shares the same basilican plan as the other churches at the site. In the sanctuary were found the steps of the synthronus, cuttings for the altar, and fragments of the chancel screen, including a substantial portion of a figured scene. Much of the floor mosaic survives intact. Noteworthy is a cable motif of oval and circular frames containing an animal or bird that formed the outer edge of the nave mosaic. The pastophoria have been exposed in their entirety. The southeast chamber was a baptistery with cruciform basin originally roofed by a vaulted ciborium. Fragments of mosaic fallen from the inner face of the vault suggest a figured scene of saints' heads. The function of the northeast pastophorion remains uncertain, but it differs from the rest of the building in being paved in opus sectile instead of mosaic. Apart from the building, the most striking discovery was a large grave constructed on the mosaic floor of the south aisle. This contained the poorly preserved remains of 24 bodies buried on two separate occasions. Associated with one of the lower group was a collection of 35 items of jewelry, including open-work crosses and plaques with punched decoration of dolphins and grapes. Fragments of fabric woven from gold thread may be the remains of a small purse. In the 1987 season the major objective was the lifting of several of the more vulnerable mosaic pavements exposed in previous seasons and their transfer to a new museum nearing completion in the town of Anamur. One of these was a portion of the fragmentary Peaceful Kingdom preserved in the sanctuary of the Necropolis Church. Its removal has exposed the entire surface of its predecessor, including an inscribed dedication in addition to the two previously known. UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA EXCAVATIONS AT KOURION, CYPRUS: David Soren, University of Arizona From 1984 to 1987, excavations at Kourion in southwest- ern Cyprus have focused on a Roman house of the later first or early second century A.C. severely damaged in an earth- quake believed to be that of 21 July 365. The house was abandoned and never resettled, leaving the contents of its 14 rooms trapped in situ. To date, seven human skeletons and one mule skeleton have been found trapped within as multiple seismic pulses struck from the epicenter to the southwest. The form of the house is unparalleled in the Roman world, but it strongly resembles that of certain Cypriot vil- lage houses. Hundreds of objects of daily life have been re- covered and provide an invaluable typology for the period. These include copper alloy proportional dividers, domestic and imported amphorae, Late Roman C Ware, Cypriot Si- gillata, and even apparent heirlooms such as copper alloy lamps of the first century and a Hellenistic lampstand. Sev- eral coin hoards have produced over 400 coins. In 1987 the discovery of an adjoining building, which ap- pears to be a market area, yielded two more skeletons and a wealth of copper alloy vessels, including an elegant hanging lamp in the shape of a duck. SESSION V B: COLLOQUIUM: MATERIALS AS TEXTS: PERSPECTIVES ON ARCHAEO- METRY WHY BOTHER WITH ARCHAEOMETRY? Ursula M. Franklin, University of Toronto After several decades of increasing use of technical studies as part of archaeological projects, one may ask what this ex- tension of the tools and information sources has added to the substance of the discipline. Such questioning occurs often in situations where rich written sources are available to the in- vestigator. This paper illustrates-on the basis of case histories- that the information obtained from the artifact is in most instances complementary to the written sources, i.e., the ob- jects speak about aspects of society that written records rare- ly touch upon. Beyond the traditional questions of "when, where, and how," technical studies can provide evidence of production activities, their scale, and often their technological origins. From such studies the notion of a "technological style" emerges: a style that is as discernible as an artistic style. It can exist within a single category of materials of a culture</page><page sequence="38">266 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 (e.g., metals) but also between different categories, such as metals, ceramics, and textiles. Thus, archaeometry can not only provide additional in- formation on artifacts and their context but technical studies and their interpretation can raise questions-such as the origin and nature of a technological style-that have not been asked or addressed before. ENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM MATERI- ALS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD: John A. Gif- ford, University of Miami In 1881, the British Quaternary geologist James Geike published Prehistoric Europe: A Geological Sketch, which considered the effects of late-glacial climatic changes on the evolution of post-Paleolithic European cultures. From that time until the 1972 publication of K.W. Butzer's Environ- ment and Archaeology, the contribution of the natural sciences to environmental reconstructions for archaeological purposes has evolved haphazardly either in response to the development of new analytical techniques (e.g., palynology, dendrochronology, oxygen istope analysis), or the individual efforts of natural scientists motivated to address archaeologi- cal questions. Nevertheless, the evolution has been impressive, and this paper attempts a review of the available techniques in envi- ronmental archaeology. Successful applications of these tech- niques are presented, as well as several fundamental limita- tions of the material record in environmental reconstructions. Although environmental reconstruction is a subfield gen- erally recognized within archaeometry, it extends beyond that discipline if one defines archaeometry as "the quantita- tive analysis of objects modified by human action in the past" (Cyril Stanley Smith). Much of the material record of past environments that we analyze has not been affected by hu- man activity, which is its precise utility in the reconstruction of the natural environment. But the artificial environmental record of an archaeological site contains information regard- ing its kind and degree of human modification that may complement the unaltered record. An environment in the present context is defined as a seg- ment of the earth's surface geographically circumscribed by some set of biological or physical criteria; palaeoenviron- ments often are defined not by identical criteria but by indi- rect tokens of the biophysical environment preserved in the archaeological record. Charcoal fragments, sediment grains, and the composition of oxygen isotopes in mollusc shell are three examples of such "proxy records" used to reconstruct past environments. PROVENANCE STUDIES OF CERAMIC AND METAL ARTI- FACTS, AND DATA ANALYSIS: Vanda Vitali, Univer- sity of Toronto The elemental chemical composition of minerals and ores, particularly their pattern of minor and trace elements, is usually strongly influenced by geochemical conditions of the origin of these substances. In principle this offers an op- portunity to use the detailed chemical analysis of artifacts as a means of tracing their provenance. It will be shown that such an approach is fruitful in terms of grouping and char- acterizing ceramics and that such work can lead to answers of significant archaeological questions. A similar approach to ascertaining the provenance of metal objects meets with much greater difficulties. At present, chemical finger- printing is only possible for native metals, such as copper and gold. However, Pb isotope differentiation shows promise for determining the provenance of other metals and alloys containing Pb. An integral part of any provenance study has to be the analysis of the chemical information based on multivariate statistical procedures. This paper critically assesses the central issues related to provenance studies, and illustrates the strengths and limita- tions of technical procedures using selected case studies from the Classical period in the Mediterranean. DATING TECHNIQUES: Gary W. Carriveau, National Gallery of Art The basic question addressed is: How well can we rely on past and future dating methods in archaeometry? A wide variety of methods have been proposed and developed, in- cluding both absolute (requiring no standardization) and comparative approaches. There has been a history of uncrit- ical acceptance of some methods, simply because they were considered "scientific," followed by corrections and improve- ment as the archaeological community pointed out discrep- ancies between "dates" and well-accepted chronologies. Continued evolution of technology will most probably pro- vide further examples. Case histories are presented, and recommendations are proposed for a more critical evaluation by both the archaeo- logist and archaeometrist. METALS AS TEXT: Pieter Meyers, Los Angeles County Museum of Art In antiquity the most common metals were copper and its alloys, silver, gold, lead and, somewhat later, iron. Techni- cal examinations and/or scientific analyses applied to metal objects and associated materials have made significant con- tributions to the understanding of the societies that produced those metals. The technology of mining, smelting, and alloying has been reconstructed largely based upon technical studies and laboratory experiments. Methods of manufacture have been deduced mostly from metal objects in our art museums. The methods and practices of the craftsman in a society are often as important and informative as his products. Archaeomet- ric studies have as yet contributed little to the distribution systems of metal, including trade. The abundance of metal objects without reliable prove- nance, i.e., not excavated under controlled excavations, en- hances the need for dating, authentication, and determina- tion of provenance. Among those, dating by archaeometric methods is limited to incidental cases and authentication requires special expertise. Provenance studies have been performed using lead isotope ratios and elemental composi-</page><page sequence="39">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 267 tions. The potential of lead isotopic ratios is reasonably well understood. On the other hand, the use of elemental compo- sitions for provenance studies has both been overestimated and underestimated. In the presentation, the above-mentioned issues are brief- ly discussed. The usefulness of archaeometric methods ap- plied to metals is demonstrated by reference to case histories that include general studies of ancient Chinese bronzes and Near Eastern silver, as well as specific studies on individual objects. CERAMIC ENQUIRIES-A RANDOM WALK IN TIME: Robert B. Heimann, Alberta Research Council Investigation into ancient ceramics with modern methods of materials science provides the archaeologist with a frame- work within which the technical competence of the individ- ual potter as well as the state of the technological develop- ment of a particular society can be assessed. Ceramics are the product of the desire of man to recreate nature, i.e., to turn clayey weathering products of rocks back into artificial rock-like material by appropriate heat treat- ment. Firing of clay results in a product with "frozen-in" mineralogical phase transitions that deviate from true (ther- modynamic) equilibrium. It is this non-equilibrium state that furnishes the analyst with important clues as to how, when, and where the pot was made. Chemically speaking, almost all ancient ceramics can be contained in the compositional space of the quaternary oxide system CaO-MgO-A1203-SiO2. Composition of the raw clay, grain size resulting from processing of the raw mate- rial, firing temperature, firing atmosphere, use and burial conditions: all may influence the "composition" of the ce- ramic sherd. Moreover, the composition of pottery can change with time in response to technological development in a well-defined geographical area. In Crete, for example, pottery from Neolithic times with- out a recognizable ceramic tradition was made from lime- poor clays. A more calcareous composition with relatively narrow distribution of the alumina content was favored in the Early Minoan period (EM I Pyrgos style, 2600 B.C.; EM II Vasilike Ware, 2000 B.C.). The Middle Minoan Kamares ware (2000-1700 B.C.) exhibited much better CaO control, and finally Late Minoan (1700-1400 B.C.) ware, with very small variation of the Al/Si ratio, attests to the increasing sophistication of the established technology. Much can be gained from investigation of the mineralogi- cal composition of the fired sherds by optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Decomposition of primary clay and temper minerals, and neoformation of minerals in response to firing give valuable information on the degree of control of temperature and firing atmosphere exercised by the potter. Clay types most frequently used by ancient pot- ters were illitic non-calcareous, illitic-calcareous, and kao- linitic, whose overall compositions are situated in the phase spaces quartz-anorthite-diopside-wollastonite, anorthite- gehlenite (melitite)-wollastonite-diopside, and quartz-an- orthite-mullite-spinel, respectively. The presentation centers on these three phase spaces, and petrographic studies of ancient pottery are discussed. This sample of pottery is diverse in space and time: Minoan ware; Corinthian pottery; a little jug from Olympia, Greece thought to have been the personal property of Phidias; Ro- man terra sigillata ware and molds; Spanish-colonial majol- ica from Mexico; and shell-tempered Indian pottery from the Mississippi Valley. SUMMARY OF ISSUES: George Rapp, Jr., University of Minnesota, Duluth Archaeometry shares with other archaeological scholar- ship the responsibility of expanding our knowledge of an- cient lifeways through the study of material remains. As pointed out in this colloquium, archaeometry is complemen- tary to textual studies; it is a component of analytical and environmental archaeology; and it is a unique discipline in its own right. The value of archaeometry in any archaeological context depends upon the problem addressed and upon the resources available. There are few material remains that cannot be better understood, in the human context, with the aid of some form of archaeometric analysis. Yet with limited re- sources one cannot afford to spend $10,000 in attempting to solve a "$1,000 problem." It is a question of cost/benefit analysis. Many analytical techniques used by natural scientists and engineers are not utilized in archaeology because of the lack of archaeometrists to do the fundamental experimental and exploratory work to assess the benefits an analytical technique may offer to archaeology. Working together to identify the most pressing problems and possible sources of support, archaeometrists and archaeologists can move their overlapping scholarship toward greater returns. SESSION V C: RELIGION AND ARCHAEOL- OGY I PURIFICATION IN MINOAN RELIGION: A.A.D. Peatfield, British School at Athens Archaeology and the study of religion are apparently two opposed disciplines: archaeology is concerned with the re- covery of material objects, whereas religion deals with the abstractions of belief and practice. Like oil and water they do not mix. Yet the separation is only apparent: archaeology records the relationships of objects to learn their levels of interaction, and interpret the social systems that led to their creation and deposition. In turn religious practices involve the manipulation of objects in ritualized ways, and beliefs may be embodied in symbols. Purification is an abstract concept meaningful in many religions, yet its expression may require the use of objects: architectural forms and/or vessels. As an example, the evi- dence from Minoan Crete is examined: spring sanctuaries, lustral basins, rhyta, and vessel-figurines. Each class has re- ceived much individual attention, but nowhere has the evi-</page><page sequence="40">268 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 dence been synoptically considered to produce a coherent picture of interactive use and underlying meaning. The existence of spring sanctuaries, and the interpreta- tion of vessel-figurines as "guardian of the water-supply" suggest a sacred importance of water. The use of rhyta for libations, and lustral basins associated with shrines like the Knossos Throne Room suggest ceremonies where liquids were manipulated; this is confirmed by iconographic cult scenes. Minoan religion was concerned with the natural world, where water is a medium of fertility. In similarly focused religions, water symbolizes the life-affirming qualities of both fertility and purification, and both meanings operate in rituals. The archaeological evidence suggests that such a be- lief system was also significant to Minoan religion. ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR DARK AGE CULT AT ISTHMIA: Catherine Morgan, Trinity Hall, Cam- bridge This paper summarizes the ceramic and contextual evi- dence for cult activity at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isth- mia from ca. 1050-700 B.C. Reexamination of material ex- cavated by Oscar Broneer in the 1950s has revealed a pot- tery sequence dating from early Protogeometric through Ar- chaic (primarily Corinthian with some Attic imports). This sequence includes a limited range of forms, mainly cups, best associated with such ritual activity as toasting or dining. Finds are concentrated in an ash layer in an area east of the temple which was subsequently terraced late in the eighth century. We may therefore postulate a sacrificial area, possibly with an ash altar, in continuous use from early Protogeometric. Evidence for pre-eighth century cult is rare on the Greek mainland. I discuss the significance of this find for the gen- eral understanding of early Greek cult, and also examine specific issues relating to the development of the early Co- rinthian state and its relations with areas east of the Isth- mus. Isthmian data are compared with evidence from neigh- boring sanctuaries, including Perachora and Epidauros, in order to establish the pattern of activity on the borders of the emergent Corinthian state. In conclusion, the chronology and varying intensity of activity at Isthmia are compared with developments at Corinth itself, and Dark Age activity is discussed as a foundation for later developments at the Sanctuary of Poseidon. PRIVATE AND CIVIC CULT AT CORINTH: Ann Steiner, Franklin and Marshall College Few ancient sites yield a full picture of the religious activ- ity of a polis, whether from literary sources or archaeologi- cal remains. Written records and physical evidence from an- cient Corinth, however, provide us with evidence of worship of Olympian deities and heroes as well as private worship in the form of funerary practice. This paper presents the re- sults of a recent study and suggests a previously unrecog- nized relationship between the spheres of private funerary ritual and civic religion. Despite the apparent similarity between the death of a mortal and the death of a hero or nymph, the rituals con- nected with private funerals and public worship of heroes or nymphs are in certain respects explicitly separate from one another. The pollution acquired through a death in the fam- ily or through connection with a funeral often prohibits its entrance into a sanctuary (see R. Parker, Miasma [Oxford 1983] 32-38). Ordinarily we do not see overlap between offerings in mortal graves and offerings at civic shrines. Other ancient evidence suggests, however, that the similar- ities did not go unrecognized. At least one scholar interprets the legislative suppression of ostentation in private Athenian funerals as intended to diminish competition with the treat- ment of heroes by the state (S. Humphreys, The Family, Women, and Death [Oxford 1983] 89). The pottery from the Sacred Spring, one of the largest and most architecturally complex sanctuaries of the Classi- cal period at Corinth, was studied by the author in 1985 and 1986. The results form the basis for several conclusions hav- ing applications to our general understanding of the con- junction of public and private religion and our view of civic religion as a whole. The pottery presents new evidence for relating archaeologically attested cult elements at the Sacred Spring to local funerary custom: the proportion of oil-con- taining vessels, including Athenian white-ground funerary lekythoi and local Corinthian imitations, is virtually unpar- alleled at other Corinthian sanctuaries and corresponds to what is found in contemporary graves. Comparison of the pottery to that found at nymph sanctuaries outside Corinth buttresses the identification of the divinity worshipped at the site as a nymph, possibly the daughter of the pre-Dorian Timandrus, Kotyto. The unique presence of funerary ves- sels, together with provisions for purification through lus- tration and propitiation through animal sacrifice, helps to classify the cult practiced at the Sacred Spring as the type of worship where collective guilt-possibly for the death of the nymph-is expiated (see W. Furley, Studies in the Use of Fire in Ancient Greek Religion [New York 1981] 161-72). CULT AND INDUSTRY OF ISTHMIA: A SHRINE ON THE RACHI: Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovid, Wilson College During excavations at the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Isth- mia under the direction of Oscar Broneer of the University of Chicago, investigations on the ridge known as Rachi lo- cated just to the south of the sanctuary revealed the remains of a weaving and dyeing establishment of the early Hellenis- tic period (C. Kardara, AJA 65 [1961] 261-66). Discovered on the highest part of the hill, at the western edge of the Rachi excavation, were the remains of a small shrine estab- lished prior to the industrial settlement. Little is known about the cult places of deities at Isthmia outside the pre- cincts of Poseidon and Palaimon. Study of the shrine has been undertaken in order to clarify the nature of the cult, its role in the industrial settlement, and its connection, if any, with the sanctuary of Poseidon below. Although no struc- ture remains, two pairs of circular depressions and cuttings in the bedrock suggest a temenos of some sort. Roof tiles and</page><page sequence="41">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 269 other architectural fragments from the area may also be con- nected with the shrine. Additional evidence for the existence of the cult is provided by the deposits of miniature votive vases, fragments of marble sculpture, and terracotta plaques. Preliminary study of the datable material indicates that the shrine was in existence by the fifth century B.C. and that it, like the industrial establishment, was abandoned be- fore the last quarter of the third century B.C. Is it possible to determine the deity to whom the shrine was dedicated? Demeter, Kore, Artemis, Dionysus, and Eu- teria are known to have been honored at the Isthmus (IG IV, 203 at Verona). The presence of numerous hydriae among the votives, and the nature of the figurines, lamps, and other objects suggest a tentative identification with the cult of Demeter. What goddess more appropriate for weav- ers and dyers of textiles than Demeter Malophorus, the pa- troness of wool, the raw material essential for their craft? THE INTERIOR ARRANGEMENT OF THE TEMPLE OF As- KLEPIOS AT ATHENS: Sara B. Aleshire, University of California, Berkeley IG II2, 1534A is the earlier of two large third-century inventories of the Athenian Asklepieion. All previous schol- arship on this inscription (J. Sundwall, Epigraphische Bei- trdge [Leipzig 1906] 78; W.B. Dinsmoor, The Archons of Athens in the Hellenistic Age [Cambridge, Mass. 1931] 160-62; W.S. Ferguson, Athenian Tribal Cycles [Cam- bridge, Mass. 1932] 54-60; W.K. Pritchett and B.D. Mer- itt, The Chronology of Hellenistic Athens [Cambridge, Mass. 1940] 47-60; C. Habicht, Hypomnemata [G6ttingen 1982] 67-68) has focused almost exclusively on chronologi- cal problems. What has heretofore escaped notice is the fact that the inventory itself, which records dedications present in the temple by location, is arranged in the following systematic fashion: 1) Dedications on the wall near the cult statue; 2) dedications on the woodwork of the roof; 3) dedications on the side walls; 4) dedications on the wall in which the en- trance was located; 5) dedications kept in special places for safekeeping or because of discrepancies in the record about them; and 6) dedications placed on the cult statue. It is fur- ther notable that certain priests seem to have collected the dedications of their priesthoods in specific spots, while other locations were devoted to the display of dedications of specif- ic types (anatomical ex votos, typoi, or coins). The informa- tion gathered from this inventory can be correlated with in- formation from excavations in the Asklepieion to allow a much more detailed reconstruction of the interior of the tem- ple than has previously been attempted. The purpose of this paper is to bring the information offered by IG II2, 1534A to the attention of students of Greek architectural history and of Greek votives. VOTIVE OFFERINGS FROM HELLENISTIC FAILAKA: EAST MEETS WEST: Joan Breton Connelly, New York University Little is known of Hellenistic art outside the thoroughly Hellenized centers of the Greek East. Thus, the new evi- dence from the Seleucid fortress on ancient Ikaros (Failaka, Kuwait) is welcome in recording artistic developments in a distant outpost. New interpretations of votive offering from the middle of the third to the first century B.C. have resulted in increased understanding of the local artistic production and the worship of both eastern and western cults. Contrary to the view maintained in an earlier study (H.E. Mathiesen, Ikaros, The Hellenistic Settlements 1: The Terracotta Figu- rines [Copenhagen 1982]), terracotta figurines can be matched with local molds, thus attesting to their local manu- facture. The sequence clearly illustrates the dilemma of pro- vincial coroplasts attempting to maximize a repertoire of vo- tives based on a limited number of molds. Not only are mul- tiple issues from a single mold common, but the same mold was used to produce very different types, altered by the changing of attributes and costume. The female head of a Greek "Tanagra" type figurine is duplicated on a statuette of a Parthian king, disguised behind an added beard and crown. The economy and enterprise with which the coro- plasts served the diverse demands of local Oriental cults as well as newly introduced Hellenized cults resulted in a rich local production. Toreutic molds, probably taken from relief decoration on military paraphernalia, further illustrate an attempt to maximize available prototypes. Three rough stone sculptures of an Oriental Herakles- Melquart type and two Greek terracottas of Herakles, one of a young athletic type and the other related to the Farnese type, attest to the local worship of the hero in his eastern and western forms. As generations of Greek soldiers far from home attempted to honor old heroes and new potentates and to serve old cults and Hellenize unfamiliar ones, a rich and hybrid character for local worship was born in the blending of eastern and western traditions. Isis IN NUBIA: Nettie K. Adams, University of Ken- tucky Isis in Nubia is well known from the several temples ded- icated to her as well as from numerous historical and epi- graphic records. Although these materials are valuable, they present only an outline picture of the cult of Isis. The recent discovery at Qasr Ibrim of a small temple to- gether with its furnishings and sacred objects provides some of the detail which was previously missing from our know- ledge of Isis in Nubia. For the first time we have the perish- able organic paraphernalia which was part of this cult. Cur- tains and other fine textiles, containers of leather and bas- ketry, bodies of mummified birds together with their linen wrappings, and numerous wooden objects were found well preserved. In addition were found stone statuary, altars, and offering tables; vessels of pottery, faience, and glass; statu- ettes and other small metal objects; and necklaces of stone and glass beads with their cotton strings still intact. Since this material was found in situ on the temple floor, its solid provenience has allowed for the reinterpretation of similar objects found out of context or from unknown loca- tions in Nubia. Our knowledge of the Isis cult is a great deal</page><page sequence="42">270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 richer when the historical descriptions, the architectural re- mains, and the furnishings and ritual objects are brought together. Now we lack only the ancient participants to com- plete the picture. EVIDENCE FOR AN IMPERIAL CULT AT COSA: Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton, Finger Lakes Society Recently, scholars (especially Saladino, Epigraphica 39 [1977] 148-51) have posited the existence of an Imperial cult housed on the arx at Cosa at least from the time of Tibe- rius. This assertion is based on an inscribed table dedicated to Drusus the Younger, who died in A.D. 23, and discovered near the Capitolium during excavations conducted by the American Academy in Rome and directed by Frank Brown. The excavators have long believed that an Imperial cult was installed somewhere on the arx at Cosa. Unpublished dis- sertations concerning the marble sculptures and inscriptions from Cosa (Collins, Columbia 1970, and Bace, Michigan 1983) have connected with this cult several fragmentary portraits, primarily of Julio-Claudians, with which can be associated pieces of two altars of Tiberian date and an in- scription mentioning Lucius Caesar as a patron of Cosa, dated between 2 B.C. and A.D. 2. All but the last were found on the arx during the Academy's excavations and are in the Antiquarium on the site. The last (Saladino, 143-45) is said to have been found on the arx of Cosa and is now in the Antiquarium at Orbetello. One purpose of this paper is to present the statues public- ly for the first time, since the portraits have never been formally published. Among the three heads, one is Hadrian, another possibly Claudius. Two over life-sized partially draped males and one cuirassed statue, all headless, complete the group. The installation of an Imperial cult in post-Augustan Cosa follows a period of extensive repairs to the town under Augustus. The attention given to the upkeep of the Capitolium through the time of Hadrian points to it as the seat of the cult. Thus, Cosa further documents the spread of the Imperial cult through central Italy in the first century A.C. SESSION V D: ROMAN SCULPTURE AND AR- CHITECTURE AUGUSTAN PORTRAITURE AND THE PTOLEMAIC TRA- DITION: Mark D. Fullerton, Ohio State University, Columbus When Octavian was entitled "Augustus" in 27 B.C., he developed an official portrait image appropriate to his new position. At this time, the "Actium" type, basically a Hellen- istic "personality portrait," gave way to far more idealized types intended to embody the princeps' status-a delicate balance between mortal and divine. Conventionally the de- velopment in portraiture is viewed as another manifestation of that same Augustan "neo-Classicism" seen in such monu- ments as the Ara Pacis and the Augustan Forum; indeed, the famous portrait from Primaporta assumes the pose of Poly- kleitos's Doryphoros. However, the use of Classical body types for Roman portraits had been commonplace for about a century, and the allegedly neo-Classical Augustan portrait head does not closely resemble anything Classical, portrait or otherwise. The Augustan image is quite simply an idealized version of a Hellenistic type, and for this there existed a parallel far closer in time and similar in temperament than the art of Periklean Athens. In an attempt to blend Alexander icono- graphy with an indigenous tradition of abstract formalism, the Ptolemaic kings and queens of Egypt were represented by portraits sometimes startlingly similar to those of the Au- gustan principate. Ptolemaic and Augustan policies also shared a propagandistic emphasis on the ruler's family and highly conventionalized ways of representing all its mem- bers-male and female, young and old. In Egypt, this means of establishing a stable and peaceful dynastic continuity had prevailed for millennia. It is, of course, possible that the similarities between Au- gustan and Ptolemaic portraiture simply reflect a parallel concern with presenting a quasi-divine image. If, however, Octavian was influenced by any precedent in creating the Augustan image, several factors suggest that it was more probably the tangible Ptolemaic portrait tradition than some abstract conception of Classical idealism: 1) Augustan por- traits look far more like Ptolemaic portraits than like any- thing Classical. In fact, Strocka has recently shown that a portrait in Cairo long identified as Ptolemaic actually repre- sents Augustus himself. 2) The transformation of portrait type occurred during the years following Octavian's return from Egypt in 29 B.C. 3) Egypt was considered the very epitome of stability and prosperity. These conditions were at the heart of Augustan propaganda and are concepts vividly embodied in Egyptian portraiture. 4) The important role of Egyptian imagery in Augustan art and architecture has re- cently been demonstrated by E. Buchner's discovery of the Solarium Augusti and D. Thompson's convincing reinter- pretation of the Tazza Farnese. THE SORRENTO APOLLO: A REATTRIBUTION: Linda Jones Roccos, Rutgers University Since the 19th century the Apollo on the Sorrento Base, which wears a peplos with shoulder-pinned back mantle and holds a kithara, has been identified as a reflection of an Apollo by Skopas mentioned by Pliny (HN 36.25). This type of Apollo is known also from five statues and statuettes. Yet, a stylistic and iconographic analysis of these Apollos suggests an Augustan creation rather than a Classical prototype. Distinctive elements that point to a Roman origin for the type are: the peplos with belted kolpos and drapery knot, the opening on the left side of the peplos, the mixture of fifth- century and Hellenistic styles in the drapery, and the tied- up hair. The size and proportion of the extant versions vary so greatly that a cult statue, not available for direct copying, must have been the source. The cult statue most appropriate for this image would have been the one depicted on Roman coins as "Apollo Pala- tinus." It was seen by Propertius (2.31.15-16) in Augustus's Temple of Apollo on the Palatine, "and last between his</page><page sequence="43">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 271 mother and his sister stood the Pythian god himself, clad in long raiment, his voice uplifted in song." THE DANCING MAENADS RELIEFS: GREEK OR Ro- MAN? L.-A. Touchette, St. John's College, Oxford University After more than 200 years of Classical scholarship, ar- chaeologists are still debating what is or is not Roman about Roman art. Recent scholarship has attempted to bring copies of Greek sculpture into the orbit of Roman art by reassessing these works within their Roman context as indi- cators of Roman taste and culture rather than solely as aids to the reconstruction of lost Greek originals. P. Zanker's Klassizistische Statuen (Mainz 1974) set the standard for the consideration of freestanding copies in this light. My work is concerned with examining the repertoire of copies of Classical relief sculpture using the criteria established by Zanker and others. The Dancing Maenads reliefs provide the fullest docu- mentation of the changes in form, function, and meaning which distinguish relief copies from their Greek originals. The individual Maenads were copied from a major public monument in fifth-century Athens dedicated to Dionysos. As copies, however, they were stripped of their original function and served as ars in the strictest sense of the word- to adorn and embellish the public and private spheres of the Roman world. Study of them reveals the broad spectrum from exact reproduction to new creation available to the Ro- man patron of the arts. Maenads are represented singly, with other Maenads, or amongst Dionysiac revelers on pieces as diverse as sarcophagi and gems, Arretine ware and marble panels, fountains and Campana reliefs. A survey of more than 300 years of production demonstrates the place of the Dancing Maenads reliefs within the mainstream of Roman art. THE CULT OF APPEARANCES AND THE FUNERARY RE- LIEF OF ULPIA EPIGONE: Eve D'Ambra, Yale Uni- versity The focus of this paper is a funerary relief from the Tomb of the Volusii in Rome, now in the Museo Gregoriano Profano, Musei Vaticani (inv. no. 9856). The late Flavian or early Trajanic marble relief depicts Ulpia Epigone reclining half-nude on a kline (CIL VI, 7394). Previous scholarship on the relief has been purely descriptive or concerned with the social milieu (H. Wrede, AA 92 [1977] 395-431). The work merits a more thorough analysis, however, because of its eclectic iconography as well as its composition and style, which reflect the translation of the kline type from freestanding to relief sculpture. The significance of the relief lies in the iconography which combines the motifs of mythological portraiture and emblems of the traditional virtues. The figure's partial nud- ity and gesture recall portraits of women in the guise of Ve- nus which were becoming popular during the Flavian peri- od. Yet the attributes of the dog and the workbasket attest to Ulpia's fulfillment of the domestic ideal. A similar juxtapo- sition of venustas and castitas is found in the epitaph of Allia Potestas (CIL VI, 37965), and this text sheds light on the standards by which Ulpia is commemorated. Furthermore, Ulpia's display of jewelry and her coiffure in the Flavian court style suggest either her social position or aspirations. The diverse motifs and their sources reflect the patronage of Imperial freedmen or their descendants as well as the changing ideals of this class. THE BETH SHEAN HADRIAN RECONSIDERED: Richard A. Gergel, Central Michigan University On 25 July 1975, an amateur archaeologist discovered fragments of a bronze cuirassed statue of Hadrian at the site of a Roman military fort near Beth Shean (Scythopolis). Subsequent excavations by the Israel Department of Anti- quities and Museums yielded additional fragments and a bronze head of a youth. Gideon Foerster ("A Cuirassed Bronze Statue of Hadrian," 'Atiqot Eng. Ser. 17 [1985] 139-60) dates the statue to the reign of Hadrian and inter- prets an unusual representation of six nude warriors on the breastplate as the duel between Aeneas and Turnus (Verg. Aen. 12.698-952). The cuirass, however, displays several anomalies. The absence of a Medusa, Gorgoneion, or other talismanic de- vice on the chest of the figure; the presence of a sash rather than a military cloak over the shoulders; the purely mytho- logical nature of the figural decoration; and the presence of the figured frieze across the chest rather than across the ab- domen find no counterpart in cuirassed statues of the Ha- drianic period. A possible explanation exists for these unusual features. Portrait statues in the Roman world were often restored, renewed, rejuvenated, and given new heads. In the legionary camps, in particular, it was more economical to change the head of a statue than to commission a completely new work. I believe that the troops stationed at the Roman fort near Beth Shean combined an imported head of Hadrian with a reused cuirassed statue of local origin, creating a military pastiche showing the Emperor in the armor of a Hellenistic ruler with a second-century child captive at his side. SCULPTURAL REUSE AMONG LATE ANTIQUE MARBLE EMPEROR PORTRAITS: Patricia Erhart Mottahedeh, Harvard University Architectural reuse is well documented in the Late An- tique period, but sculptural reuse-and portrait reuse spe- cifically-is not, although the latter was in fact an equally common economy of the time. Sculptural reuse offers a long unrecognized key to the character and evolution of the Late Antique portrait-one much needed as there is no scholarly consensus about the identification and/or date of almost every Late Antique emperor portrait, and it is emperor por- traits that provide the criteria for identifying and dating the rest of Roman portraiture. Reuse among Late Antique em- peror portraits, demonstrated here by a broad selection of examples, is especially significant because it proves how pervasive the practice must have been in Late Antique so-</page><page sequence="44">272 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 ciety. Two particular categories of Late Antique emperor portraits, those which are colossal and those which portray emperors officially condemned by their successors (damnatio memoriae), naturally reveal a higher incidence of reuse than do either the whole body of Late Antique emperor portraits or the whole body of Late Antique portrait sculpture in gen- eral. Even so, reuse is so predominant among Late Antique emperor portraits as to suggest that creation ex novo was more anomalous than reuse in Late Antique portrait sculp- ture. Only reuse can explain the manifold problems asso- ciated with the Late Antique portrait: the formal incongru- ities within individual portraits, the existence of different physiognomies for one and the same person and of identical physiognomies for different individuals, the numerous in- consistencies of style and technique among portraits of the same time and same place, and-most important-the ob- vious lack of a recognizable stylistic evolution in portraiture between the third and seventh centuries A.C. THE ROMAN ARCHES OF ASIA MINOR: Suna Giiven, Middle East Technical University Among monumental arches in Asia Minor, the specifi- cally triumphal arch is rare, its place being taken by the ceremonial and honorific arch, in conjunction not only with city gates but public squares, streets, and buildings. The ar- chaeological record is not always clear but enough exists to suggest useful general conclusions. Surprisingly, a general interpretive assessment of the role of these arches in the field of architectural history is lacking. Rather, they are treated in piecemeal factual surveys or as strictly archaeological documents. This study aims to elucidate the meaning and significance of this class of building with particular reference to the spe- cial contribution of Graeco-Roman traditions in Asia Mi- nor. Hence, the arches are treated as a corpus. A statistical approach is taken to analyze the formal elements of archi- tectural design and the location of the arches, a distinction being made between Roman colonies and other conservative or progressive centers, depending on geographical and demographic considerations. The results show that due to the nature of Romanization in Asia Minor, a new type of ostentatious and scenographic building evolved to fit the new requirements for civic propa- ganda. The specific contribution of Asia Minor in the evolu- tion of the bath-gymnasium complex has recently been dem- onstrated. This study suggests the importance of another such contribution, or synthesis, and strengthens the premise of Asia Minor as a viable source for the new type of ceremo- nial and commemorative arch, the triple arch in particular. OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMED ROTUNDA MAUSOLEUM: Mark J. Johnson, Brigham Young University The domed rotunda as a mausoleum type found its great- est expression in the imperial mausolea constructed in the Late Antique period. A recent theory (J. Rasch, Das Max- entius-Mausoleum an der Via Appia [Mainz 1984]) derives a subtype ("podium rotundas") directly from the Pantheon of Hadrian. While it is true that the exterior form of some Late Antique imperial mausolea is closely related to the form of the Pantheon, other sources are evident. This paper looks at one of the more obvious of these sources, that of Roman funerary architecture, in particular, earlier domed circular tombs. Three basic steps in the development of the domed rotun- da mausoleum are identified with examples given of each. The first step, occurring during the first century A.C., was to cover the cella with a dome. The dome is not externally visible and the plan of the building itself is not necessarily circular. In the second stage, the tomb is circular with a large interior cella. The cella is domed but the dome is still not expressed externally. The third stage, the mature domed rotunda mausoleum, is characterized by a circular or poly- gonal plan, a large interior space with relatively thin exte- rior walls, and a dome which is externally visible. Evidence suggests that it first appeared during the Severan period. Embellishments such as exterior porticoes and clerestory lighting followed during the course of the third and fourth centuries. The evidence suggests, therefore, that the Late Antique imperial mausoleum owed its form not only to the influence of temple architecture but also to the general de- velopment of Roman funerary architecture. SESSION VI A: GREEK SCULPTURE AND THE MINOR ARTS FROM MONKEY TO MAN: THE EVOLUTION OF A GEO- METRIC SCULPTURAL TYPE: Susan Langdon, Uni- versity of Missouri-Columbia This paper examines the origins and iconography of a seated type of bronze figurine which appears in eighth-cen- tury Peloponnesian sanctuaries. The figure, of indetermi- nate gender, sits on a stool with elbows on knees and hands to mouth. Variations may give the figure facial features and a small rounded object to hold, or place the figure in a squat- ting position. It variously appears to be thinking, eating, even making music. The most striking feature is the figure's inherent ambiguity. Not only genderless, the sitters are re- markably quasi-human. The curving limbs have an exag- gerated wiriness unusual even for Geometric sculpture, and heads taper to a long muzzle-like jaw. Most telling are the scooped-out hollows along the heads of certain examples, which complete the effect suggested in others of an inten- tionally simian character. These bronzes subsequently in- spired a smaller, portable version which adorned pendants. These apparently amuletic versions, found in graves as well as sanctuaries, had a distribution throughout Macedonia and Thessaly lasting into the sixth century. The origin of this little apelike figure with its various anthropomorphic poses is to be found in the baboon of Egyptian religious iconography. Although the motif had al- ready enjoyed a long popularity in other Mediterranean lands, its occurrence in Greece tracks a unique passage of mainstream Geometric sanctuary art into the ranks of local or folk art. Its iconographical and artistic associations add a</page><page sequence="45">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 273 new dimension to the emerging picture of the sources of Geometric sculpture. THE BEGINNING OF GREEK POLYCHROME PAINTING: Gerald P. Schaus, Wilfrid Laurier University Polychrome vase painting (including the use of light brown for male flesh) appeared suddenly in five Greek wares about the mid-seventh century. The significance of this has so far been missed. Among these vases are two whose scenes seem to reflect "free" painting. The sudden ap- pearance of polychrome vase painting in so many wares, and the oft-noted similarities in development between vase and "free" painting, suggest that polychrome "free" painting must have appeared in Greece just at this time. The frag- ments of wall painting from the seventh-century temples of Apollo at Corinth and Poseidon at Isthmia support this idea. There is further support to be found in Pliny (HN 7.126, 7.205, 35.15-16, 35.55-56), who provides the most detailed information we have about the development of early paint- ing. In two places we may infer from Pliny that painting in color began about the time of the Bacchiad overthrow in Corinth (657 B.C.). Similarly, the development of vase painting, parallel to Pliny's stages of progress in "free" painting, suggests the same time for the introduction of color. Pliny (HN 7.205, 35.15) acknowledges the priority of Egypt in "free" painting, and since the first large-scale Greek presence in Egypt can be dated ca. 660 B.C., we might suggest ca. 660-655 B.C. for the beginning of poly- chrome "free" painting in Greece. There is one contrary piece of dating evidence in Pliny. We are told that King Kandaules of Lydia, who died ca. 680 B.C., bought a large painting (tabula) by Boularchos depicting either a battle (HN 35.55) or a destruction (HN 7.126) of the Magnesians. There are, however, strong reasons to believe that Kandau- les was not the purchaser and that this painting (presum- ably polychrome) should be connected with the proverbial destruction of the Magnesians, ca. 652 B.C. (Strab. 14.647), by the Treres. THE FOREHEAD SNAIL CURL IN GREEK SCULPTURE: A CHRONOLOGICAL STUDY: Glenn E. Markoe, Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute The purpose of this paper is to explore the chronology of a specific hairstyle feature in Greek sculpture: the treatment of tightly woven snail curls which adorn the brows of late Archaic heads. Worn by both male and female figures alike, this feature occurs on a great variety of works in relief (on stelai and architectural sculpture) and in the round (on stone, terracotta, and bronze statuary). In The Archaic Style (pp. 107-108), Ridgway suggested that the snail curl fore- head treatment may owe its inspiration to Oriental, specifi- cally Achaemenid, prototypes. In fact, this hairstyle feature occurs regularly at Persepolis, where it appears on the Treasury reliefs and on the Palace of Darius, which are generally dated to the first decade of the fifth century (Far- kas, Achaemenid Sculpture 53). Important chronological evidence for the introduction of this feature in Achaemenid art is provided by the Behistun Monument of Darius I, which is securely dated to 522-518 B.C. On it, a single row of forehead snail curls is worn by the two rear attendants of Darius, who retains the traditional forehead treatment of semicircular swags characteristic of the Neo-Assyrian style. The incipient nature of this feature on the Behistun relief is suggested by its flat treatment and by its juxtaposition with the large semicircular hair swag on the temple which is re- tained from the earlier Neo-Assyrian hairstyle. The snail curl forehead treatment is a characteristic feature of Cypriot male votive statues of the late Archaic and sub-Archaic styles. A head from one such statue with elaborately ren- dered forehead curls was found in the Persian siege mound at Palaepaphos, which can be dated on historical grounds to 498 B.C. The head's lack of surface wear indicates that it was a recent dedication at the time of its confiscation by the Persians, thus suggesting a date of manufacture in the last decade of the sixth century. The Greek evidence points equally to an incipient date at the end of the sixth century. The snail curl forehead treatment is conspicuously absent on the reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury, datable to 525 B.C. On the other hand, it figures prominently on architec- tural sculpture from the Aphaia Temple at Aegina, the Apollo Daphnaephoros Temple at Eretria, and the Athe- nian Treasury at Delphi, all of which are dated on stylistic grounds to the early decades of the fifth century. Supporting evidence may be found on depictions in contemporary Attic red-figured vase painting of the early fifth century B.C. In summary, the evidence of the Behistun Monument and Cypriot sculpture suggests that the snail curl forehead treat- ment was introduced to Greece from the East, where it orig- inated in the final decades of the sixth century. A date at the very end of the sixth century is thus indicated for its appear- ance in Greek art, where it enjoyed a brief but widespread vogue in the early decades of the fifth century. THE STYLE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPREAD IN- CUSE COINAGE OF SYBARIS: Martha K. Risser, Uni- versity of Pennsylvania Ancient sources describe Archaic Sybaris as a city of im- mense wealth and luxury. Numismatic evidence indicates that Sybaris minted more coins than any other contempo- rary South Italian city; about as many Sybarite dies have been identified as are known from all other spread incuse mints together. Moreover, the rate of die linkage found in the Sybarite material is very low-many dies are repre- sented by single coins-so the sample, already large, is un- likely to include examples of every original die (cf. Thomp- son, NS 10 [1961] 711). Knud Fabricius's classification of Sybarite coins into four groups (CIN II [1957] 65-76) is expanded in this paper. Classes A and B, much larger than Classes C and D, are subdivided into further groups in order to illustrate the sty- listic development of the coin types within the classes. The stylistic sequence, as well as the large number of dies, indi- cates that the spread incuse coins of Sybaris must have been struck over a relatively long period of time compared to the other spread incuse mints.</page><page sequence="46">274 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 This paper argues that the spread incuse series began shortly after the introduction of coinage to the Greek main- land (for earliest Greek coinage, see J.H. Kroll and N.M. Waggoner, AJA 88 [1984] 325-40), while the latest spread incuse coins of Sybaris date to the time of the city's 510 B.C. destruction, contra Michael Vickers (NC 145 [1985] 1-44). PRIZE CROWNS AND GREEK IMPERIAL COINAGE: Ste- phen A. Brunet, University of Texas, Austin The most popular athletic motif in the period from Com- modus to Diocletian was probably the prize crown, which differed greatly in appearance from and largely replaced the wreath as the symbol of athletic victory. Its identification as a crown was in part due to studies of Greek Imperial coins (Dressel, ZfN 24 [1904]; Imhoof-Blumer, Nomisma 5 [1910]), but subsequent study has concentrated on the prize crowns shown in other media, especially mosaics (Meisch- ner, JdI 89 [1974]; Duval, BAC N.S. 12-148 [1980]). The coins showing prize crowns deserve reexamination since they are the best evidence for the origin of the prize crown. Coins from Nicaea and Tarsus show that the prize crown was well established as a coin type in the time of Commodus and that its use in the festivals of these cities must predate A.D. 180. In the next two centuries 59 cities in an area stretching from Thrace through Asia Minor to Syria de- picted prize crowns on their coins, but the motif was never used in mainland Greece. It was especially favored in Asia Minor to promote the festivals of those cities, such as Caesa- rea Cappadociae, which had not been prominent in the Classical and Hellenistic periods. The numismatic evidence suggests that the prize crown was developed not in mainland Greece but in Asia Minor, possibly at Nicaea. It then spread throughout the Greek East and quickly reached North Afri- ca and Sicily. LEGENDARY FAMILIAL DESCENT ON THE COINS OF RE- PUBLICAN ROME: Jane DeRose Evans, Philadelphia Society The interpretation of coin types often ends with the pro- nouncement that the types reflect the moneyer's desire to claim descent from the kings and early heroes of Rome, without determining if such claims were actually made. Claims of descent can be traced in the literary sources; the coin types should be examined in the light of such claims to determine the moneyer's intent. Only three families claimed descent from legendary fig- ures in the third century; the numbers swell through the sec- ond and first centuries, so that by the 40s, 19 or 20 more families claimed figures from Rome's early history as ancestors. The earliest depiction of a legendary ancestor appears on a bronze coin of the first decades of the second century; the precious metal coins followed suit after a lag of 55 years, and the type could be disguised as a normal chariot type. Not until the Social War did another such type appear on three coins. There was a lapse of another generation before the types reappeared, on the coins of Brutus; he was swiftly fol- lowed by three other moneyers. Of 69 moneyers who had the opportunity to boast of their ancestry on coins from the mid- second century on, only nine, or 13%, took advantage of the opportunity to do so. Of these, four minted during the Civil Wars. Thus we must be careful not to confer genealogies on moneyers who used figures from legends of early Rome, but to examine the types in light of the political and social cir- cumstances at the time of minting. GREEK ATHLETIC RECORDS AND THE QUESTION OF SPECIALIZATION: David C. Young, University of California, Santa Barbara All scholars now follow E.N. Gardiner and believe "there was a constantly increasing degree of specialization" in Greek athletics (H.A. Harris, Greek Athletes and Athletics [London 1964] 75). This paper argues that this belief is groundless, that inscriptions and Pausanias prove the oppo- site: as time went on, athletes developed a versatility unpar- alleled in the Archaic period or modern times. This surpris- ing history of "despecialization" results from the ancient sys- tem of record-keeping (M.N. Tod, "Greek Record-Keep- ing," CQ 43 [1949] 105-12), based not on marks of time and distance, but on unprecedented multiple victories in the same or different events (Pindar, 01. 13.29-30). An athlete could set a new record only by extending a successful career longer than anyone before him, or by being more versatile. Running records soon became difficult to set. Astylos (fifth century) set a new record only by matching the long career of Chionis (three Olympiads: seventh century) and the versatility of Phanas (stade, diaulos, hoplites: sixth cen- tury). The sixth-century record-holder Milo competed in only one event (wrestling). But in the fifth century, Theo- genes set a new Olympic record, the first to win both boxing and pancration; he did the same at Isthmia (SIG3, 36). In 212 B.C. Kapros set an Olympic record by winning both wrestling and pancration, while Kleitomachos tied Theoge- nes' boxing-pancration double (Paus. 6.15). Kleitomachos then broke Theogenes' Isthmian record with a versatile "first ever" triple in boxing, pancration, and wrestling (Anth. Pal. 9.588). Leonidas (second century) topped Asty- los's running record by winning the same three races in four consecutive Olympiads. But Polites in A.D. 69 could still post a new record by diversifying, winning the stade, diau- los, and dolichos (distance race)-an amazing feat of versa- tility (Paus. 6.13.3). We must revise our views of Greek athletic training, and become more wary of Gardiner's facile assumptions that an- cient sport followed the 19th-century British pattern. A GROUP OF ATTIC RELIEF-DECORATED DECREE-STE- LAI: Michael B. Walbank, University of Calgary</page><page sequence="47">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 275 During a period of about 70 years, from the end of the Peloponnesian War, a number of decree-stelai were created in Athens that bear reliefs of a distinctive type. A stele of this kind does not have a relief-panel at the top, above a crown- ing molding and vertical fascia, but, rather, the relief is placed in a recessed panel in the face of the stele, its sides carved to resemble pillars, which in turn support the pedi- mental top of the stele. The earliest dated example occurs in 403/402 B.C., the latest in 340/339 B.C. Virtually all these stelai, of which there are 22 published and about half a dozen unpublished examples, bear decrees of the Athenian state that are concerned with foreign affairs, or Athenian dealings with foreigners, usually proxenoi. The peculiar form of these stelai seems to derive from a similar type of grave stele that first appears ca. 410 B.C. It may be signifi- cant that neither grave stelai nor decree-stelai of this type seem to have been produced after the administration of Ly- kourgos at Athens, a period during which sumptuary legis- lation was introduced, the effect of which was to prohibit the creation of finely decorated tombstones. This development, in turn, may have led to the demise of the workshop that specialized in such stelai. RHODIAN SCULPTURAL WORKSHOPS: Virginia C. Goodlett, New York University Attempts to define a Rhodian "school" of sculpture dur- ing the Hellenistic period have focused on stylistic affinities between the statues excavated on Rhodes and the works at- tributed to Rhodian sculptors in the ancient literature on art. While these studies have uncovered common themes and stylistic traits, they have not examined the evidence for workshop structure, evidence which may elucidate the mechanisms by which a common sculptural style develops. It is well known that sculptors on Rhodes came from many parts of the Hellenistic world. An examination of the epigraphical and literary evidence shows that production of bronze sculpture was dominated by a small number of fam- ily workshops which survived over several generations. Immigrant sculptors were brought into the workshops as collaborators; their continued presence on the island, presumably within their original workshops, can frequently be documented. Immigrant sculptors did not necessarily enter workshops run by sculptors from their home cities. In the first century B.C., a sculptor from Laodicea entered a workshop which had been operated for several generations by sculptors from Tyre; there, he encountered sculptors from the Rhodian Pe- raea and Soloi. Each of the major workshops experienced a similar development. For most of the Hellenistic period foreign sculptors great- ly outnumbered sculptors from Rhodes and the Peraea. In the fourth and third centuries the majority came from Athens; later, most sculptors came from the cities of Asia Minor. Only in the first century B.C., when Rome weak- ened Rhodian commercial power, did foreign sculptors cease hunting employment on the island. By the first century A.C., only native sculptors remained. Ex UTRoQUE SEXu: THE SLEEPING HERMAPHRODITE AND THE MYTH OF AGDISTIS: Aileen Ajootian, Bryn Mawr College The famous Hellenistic sculptural t)ype of the sleeping hermaphrodite is known in at least 10 Roman replicas; most familiar of these is one in the Louvre that rests upon a tufted marble cushion sculpted for it by Bernini, but several other replicas preserve the rocky ledge covered by animal skin or drapery on which the hermaphrodite slept in antiquity. A smaller version found on the island of Kos clearly preserves, as most others do not, the erect phallus. Traditionally, the type is associated with a bronze hermaphrodite nobile possi- bly created by the Greek sculptor Polykles, but this attribu- tion is tentative at best. Scholars have long noted an appar- ent tension and restlessness in pose. The legs, even in sleep, twist and stretch the drapery falling across them. Although the type is generally considered part of the group of generic Hellenistic sleepers-Satyrs, Maenads, Erotes-and has not been identified with a specific mythological figure, the meaning of the hermaphrodite asleep is less clear. Should the sleeping hermaphrodite type, like the sleeping Maenads and Satyrs, be considered part of an undifferentiated group of Dionysiac figures, or can we identify this type more pre- cisely with some specific figure in mythology? An aetiological myth of the Phrygian divinity Attis, re- corded in fullest form by Arnobius, may provide the answer. According to Arnobius (Adv. Nat. 5.5-7), Jupiter tries to seduce the Phrygian mountain Agdus when she is asleep in the form of the Magna Mater. Unsuccessful in the attempt, Jupiter lets sperm fall on the mountain itself, and the result- ing offspring is a wild, androgynous creature called Agdistis (insana et furialis libido et ex utroque sexu). Because Agdistis is so destructive, the gods decide to take action, but hesitate until Liber fills with wine the spring from which Agdistis always drinks. The drunken hermaphrodite falls asleep and Liber attaches his genitals to a tree. Awaking, Agdistis emasculates himself, and from his blood grows the tree producing the fruit from which Attis eventually is born. But Agdistis assumes a female persona akin to that of Cybele herself. Of chief concern here is the earlier phase of the story. Having drunk too much wine, the hermaphrodite Agdistis falls asleep. It is this scene, before the emasculation, that the sculptural type of the sleeping hermaphrodite may represent. That some version of the story would have been known several centuries earlier is supported by the fact that Arnobius drew on the work of Timotheus, a Eumolpid exe- gete and priest at Eleusis (ca. 300 B.C.), for his discussion of Phrygian myths. Several earlier ancient sources also attest to Timotheus as an authority on religions and oracles. Agdistis in the female aspect is represented on an inscribed relief found at Piraeus (ca. 300 B.C.), and an inscription found near the Roman Agora in Athens and dated to 82 B.C. dis- cusses a cult of Agdistis at Rhamnous. At Sardis, the Roman copy of a Greek inscription of the fourth century B.C. also mentions an Agdistis cult. From the sculptures themselves more clues can be gleaned: the often-noted restless pose, the</page><page sequence="48">276 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 erect phallus, and rocky landscape setting all support an identification of the sleeping hermaphrodite with the sleep- ing Agdistis. SESSION VI B: MATERIALS STUDIES IRON AGE BONEWORKING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN: David S. Reese, Field Museum of Natural History Recent analysis of the preliminary stages of boneworking at Iron Age sites in Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Greece indicates the rather limited range of boneworking methods employed. In the past, evidence of boneworking was mis- takenly thought to represent food butchery debris. Depending on the item to be made, the straighter and longer limb bones (metapodial, humerus, radius, ulna, fe- mur), generally of cattle or equids (but sometimes deer, sheep/goat, camel, and even ostrich), were employed for making pins, handles, cylindrical hinges, rings, mounts, inlays, gaming pieces, and buttons. Scapula and pelvis, generally of cattle, were used to make combs and buttons. Horncores, generally of cattle, were utilized, and deer antlers were also worked. The stages of working blanks in the shapes of wedges, bars, and rods into pins and inlays have been identified, as well as the waste debris from lathe-turning; some pins, han- dles, hinges, rings, gaming pieces, and buttons were defi- nitely made on a lathe. Based on the working debris and unfinished pieces, as well as some preserved implements, it is evident that saws, chisels, rasps, files, draw-knives, and rubbing stones were all used. Holes were made with a bow-drill and brace, and a compass was frequently used to make small circle-decoration. ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS OF GRAY MARBLE PERIRRHANTE- RIA: Jane B. Carter, Tulane University, and S.E. Whitney, University of Georgia Late seventh-century perirrhanteria carved from gray marble have been found at Sparta, Olympia, Isthmia, Samos, Rhodes, and Thebes. The apparent homogeneity of the marble and close stylistic similarities have occasioned the hypothesis that these perirrhanteria were made at a single location in Greece during a relatively short period. That this location was Lakonia was suggested by the availability of gray marble in Lakonia, as well as the several examples of perirrhanteria found near Sparta (F.W. Hamdorf, "Lako- nische Perirrhanterien," AM 89 [1974] 47-64). The wide distribution of the perirrhanteria, however, and a general agreement that the perirrhanterion from Samos (now in Berlin) is the earliest in the series raise the possibility that more than one center produced these large lustral basins. In order to test the hypothesis that all the gray marble perirrhanteria came from a single source, Carter took sam- ples of perirrhanteria from Sparta, Olympia, Samos, and Berlin and from possible quarry sites near Sparta. Carter and Whitney then used the mass spectrometer at the Uni- versity of Georgia to measure the quantities of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in the samples. The results show that the perirrhanteria from Olympia, Samos, and Sparta could be from the same quarry. The data for these perirrhanteria are close to those for an ancient quarry at Goranoi near Sparta. The analysis therefore con- firms the possibility that the perirrhanteria from Sparta, Olympia, and Samos were carved from marble quarried near Sparta. A new stylistic evaluation, moreover, identifies a perirrhanterion from Mistra, near Sparta, as the earliest marble perirrhanterion in Greece. ELEMENTS OF HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY: TRACE CHEMICAL ARCHIVING OF CERAMICS AND CLAYS FROM NEW NETHERLANDS/NEW YORK: Allan S. Gilbert, Fordham University The paper reports initial results of trace chemical data archiving for New Netherlands/New York ceramics and clays. Begun in 1985, the project is providing a basis for pro- venience analysis and studies of technological change in the ceramic industries of the Hudson River Valley, Long Is- land, and the New York metropolitan area. Several hundred chemical determinations have been obtained to date from pottery, bricks, and tiles ranging in age from the 17th-cen- tury Dutch colonial outpost of Fort Orange in Albany to the last major mid-20th century brickworks of the Hudson Val- ley. Some prehistoric wares are included, but Amerindian representation is still quite limited at this point. Exposures of natural clays have also been sampled and analyzed, but decline in industrial use of local clays and the expansion of urban settlement into mining localities have obliterated or rendered inaccessible many formerly worked clay deposits. This problem of accessibility, often encoun- tered in urbanized regions, has been circumvented to some extent with the innovative use of branded bricks to represent clays dug at the brickyards. Common red brick was gener- ally tempered only with sand and coal dust before burning, so that little chemical adulteration of the base clays oc- curred. With brick chemistry data in addition to available natural clays furnishing geographic markers for characteris- tic elemental distributions, origins are being traced for un- branded bricks going back into colonial times and for early redwares potentially deriving from these sources. Problems inherent in such a project, aspects of plan- ning, and some preliminary results of first-stage analyses are discussed. SELECTIVE USE OF CLAYS IN RED POLISHED WARE FABRICS AT MIDDLE CYPRIOT SITES: Jane A. Bar- low, Cornell University A study of some 200 Red Polished sherds from Middle Cypriot sites at Dhenia, Margi, Kalavasos-Laroumena, Ka- lavasos-Mitsingites, Episkopi-Phaneromeni, and Psematis- menos-Trelloukas has revealed a pattern of selective use of both calcareous and non-calcareous clays. Variations in pastes correlate with certain decorative techniques and, more unexpectedly, with some shapes. This suggests that</page><page sequence="49">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 277 the pattern revealed in an intensive survey of the Middle Cypriot site of Alambra (Barlow and Idziak, "Selective Use of Clays at a Middle Bronze Age Site in Cyprus," forthcom- ing) is widespread within Cyprus during this period. Red Polished pottery decorated with a lustrous red slip and lime-filled incision can be shown uniformly to have a calcareous paste and a slip made from an iron-bearing non- calcareous clay. In other fabrics within Red Polished ware, while surface finish remains non-calcareous, the coarser pastes show marked variation between closed and open shapes. Between 75% and 94% of most closed shapes have a calcareous com- ponent, and 65% to 100% of most open shapes are non-cal- careous. This pattern holds whether the sites are examined collectively or individually. The results of the hydrochloric acid test used for this sur- vey (validated in the Alambra study by petrographic anal- ysis and electron microprobe) suggest that by understanding the basic technology as it was perceived by the ancient pot- ters, it may be possible to refine and make more objective the numerous and confusing RP fabric subdivisions and to dis- cern chronological development and regional variations. ROMAN PROVINCIAL ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAEO- METRY: ETHNIC CONTINUITY IN DACIAN CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY: Linda Ellis, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, and Marius Tiberius Alexia- nu, Muzeul de Istorie, Piatra Neamt, Romania In Roman provincial archaeology, archaeometry can be used in studies of ancient technology to identify Roman cul- tural influences on autochthonous populations. Microscopic analyses of Dacian ceramics (first century B.C.-fourth cen- tury A.C.) have been conducted to document local and Grae- co-Roman elements which infiltrated technological operations and to understand any subsequent sociocultural implications. Pottery was chosen from over 30 sites in "Free Dacia," which was located between Roman Dacia, Moesia, and the populations to the east. Petrographic analyses have shown two distinct pyrotechnologies: Graeco-Roman- influenced pottery consisted of micaceous clays without temper, manufactured on a fast wheel, fired in complex kilns to over 1000' C, and produced in Free Dacia by experienced specialists at the regional level. The older, authochthonous technological tradition used similar clays but with up to 40% (volume) gravel temper; the pots were formed on a slow wheel or by hand, fired in a pit to 600-8000 C, and produced at the town or household level. Despite powerful Roman and eastern influences, the two wares coexisted on Dacian settlements and even in burials; graves dating to the second-fourth centuries A.C. contained eight to 15 high-fired vessels-which were unused and thus represented prestige items-together with one or two low- fired pots, which may have contained food. Moreover, vessel shapes and pottery-making techniques remained distinct and the low-fired ware was never replaced by the more advanced ceramic technology. These conclusions attest to the strength and perseverance of older, ethnic traditions under Roman colonial influence. TYPES OF SILK TEXTILES IN EARLY CHINA: Jean M. James, University of Iowa What did the Chinese silks so admired and coveted by the Romans look like? Some recent discoveries of early Chinese silks provide an answer. Two of these finds, made in 1972 and 1982, include intact garments and bolts of cloth in a wide range of fabric types. From a ca. 300 B.C. tomb in Hubei come quilts and various garments, some of them embroid- ered, others woven in complex patterns. From Tomb 1, Ma- wangdui (ca. 165 B.C.) in Hunan, come bales of silk, mittens, socks, and a large number of garments in a variety of weaves and surface treatments including embroideries, prints, gauzes, tabbies, brocades, and complex warp-patterned pieces probably woven on an early form of the drawloom. In addition to its obvious use for clothing, silk was also used as a form of currency given to officials as one of their emoluments. Furthermore, thousands of bales of silk were handed over as "gifts" to the Hsiung Nu, who were Central Asian nomads, as bribes to keep the peace on China's west- ern and northern frontiers. Silk was sent westward not as part of a commercial exchange but as tribute. Much of this tribute silk was treated by the nomads as a medium of ex- change which they traded for goods more useful to them. In this way Han silk reached merchants who sold it to those merchants dealing with the Romans. CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN ARACHNE AND LEI Zu: IN- TERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF SILK-WEAVING TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE: Penelope B. Drooker, Harvard University As early as 1500 B.C., complex silk fabrics were being produced in China; excavations in south-central China have yielded hundreds of examples of intricate loom-controlled float weaves, polychrome warp compound weaves, pile weaves, and gauzes from the fifth-second centuries B.C. which confirm the use of a highly advanced weaving tech- nology. Although Chinese cultivated silk (yarn and woven fabric from the bombyx mori silkworm) made its appearance in the West at least as early as the eighth cen- tury B.C., it was many centuries before looms were devel- oped there which could take advantage of all of the unique properties of this luxury fiber, particularly its extreme fine- ness and length. Traditional Egyptian, Greek, and Roman looms were warp-weighted or two-bar frames, suitable for relatively short warps of spun yarns (wool, linen, or wild silk), woven in simple structures such as plain weave or twill. But by the third-fourth centuries A.C., probably due to the technical challenge of imported Chinese examples, weavers within the boundaries of the Roman Empire were utilizing significantly more complex looms to produce silk fabrics in new structures (previously unknown, but with roots in both China and the West) such as damasks and weft compound weaves. In their turn, these textiles traveled east- ward, contributing to a revolution in Chinese silk-weaving technology and design within the following three centuries. Using as primary examples recently excavated silk tex- tiles (second century B.C.-seventh century A.C.) from Silk</page><page sequence="50">278 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 Road trade route sites such as Turfan in northwestern Chi- na, compared with the older silks from south-central China and with silk (and partially silk) fabrics woven within the Classical world and its periphery (sixth century B.C.- fourth century A.C.), this paper traces the interactions over time between Eastern and Western weaving technology and how they led, by the fourth-seventh centuries A.C., to an en- tirely new range of woven structures and design elements in silk textiles. CENTRAL ASIAN TEXTILES: Carol Altman Bromberg, Wayne State University In his 10th-century history of Bukhara, Narshaki noted that Central Asian merchants traded the famous cloth first woven in Zandana, one of the villages of Bukhara, "to Sog- dia, Egypt, and the cities of Rum." But not one of these tex- tiles has been found in Sogdia. Like Sassanian textiles, they have come to light only in areas far from their place of man- ufacture, where they were used to wrap precious relics in European church treasuries or Buddhist manuscripts in a walled-up cave near Tun-huang, or as burial goods of nomad tribesmen in the Caucasus along a northern trade route. The seventh-ninth century weavers of Zandaniji silks often adapted Sassanian designs that were au courant, add- ing to their repertoire of lions, rams, peacocks, eagles, horse- men, dogs, ibexes, elephants, and geometric and vegetal mo- tifs the Sassanian split palmette and bell flower, the berib- boned winged horse, the bird carrying a branch in its beak. Curiously, Zandaniji designs are not the textile patterns re- produced on wall paintings of Sogdian palaces in this period. At sites near Bukhara and Samarkand, courtiers may well wear garments fashioned of Persian imports, so closely do representations of the senmurv, boars' heads in pearl medal- lions, and birds, rams, and winged horses with imperial diadem ribbons resemble those documented at Taq-i Bustan and on Sassanian seals, stucco work, and silver. Silks with very similar motifs that have been found in Chinese Turkestan pose another question. Astana tombs yielded silks ornamented with pearl medallions enclosing winged horses wearing ribbons, beribboned birds holding foliage in their beaks, boars' heads, stags, and a royal hunter. One or two may be Sassanian-are the rest local copies, products of a second great Central Asian weaving center yet to be distinguished? SILK IN RARE COPTIC AND LATE ANTIQUE TEXTILES: Deborah Thompson, University of Maine Coptic textiles constitute one of the largest groups of ex- cavated materials (public and private collections probably contain over 200,000), but with few exceptions they derive from unscientific late 19th- and early 20th-century digs con- ducted as treasure hunts, or from anonymous commercial excavations. My work since the 1960s with Coptic textiles in museum collections has shown that despite their large numbers and lack of archaeological context, it is possible to classify Coptic textiles by technical and art historical criteria and to differentiate between the rare primary examples of motifs and scenes and their myriad replicas of poorer quality and later date. This paper briefly demonstrates how such distinctions are made and then presents some rare Coptic and eastern Mediterranean textiles containing silk. In all cases they are found to be primary examples of their type, with an accurate grasp of Late Antique iconography and style seen in other datable media, or else, in the case of two silk twills, they are seen as experimental silk weavings of the period before silk weaving was established in Western Asia. The only excep- tion to this rule, a tapestry fragment of secondary quality with a figure from the common Dionysian iconography, proves the point that imported silk in Coptic textiles is a sign of the highest quality or luxury. It contains tussah (wild silk, native to the Mediterranean) rather than true (imported) silk; thus is it one of the numerous secondary examples of such textiles in which, however, an unusual fiber is intro- duced, quite possibly in imitation of a fine primary weaving which contained Chinese silk. SESSION VI C: RELIGION AND ARCHAEOL- OGY II MIDDLE BRONZE AGE TEMPLES AT TELL EL-HAYYAT, JORDAN: THE SOCIOCULTURAL CONDITIONS OF CULT IN A VILLAGE SETTING: Bonnie S. Magness- Gardiner, University of Arizona Excavations carried out in the 1985 season at Tell el- Hayyat on the east bank of the Jordan River revealed a series of four superimposed temples dating from ca. 2000 B.C. (Middle Bronze IIA) to ca. 1550 B.C. (Middle Bronze IIC). The temples are built of mudbrick and consist of a single room almost square in plan, with an opening flanked by two projecting wall stubs. The entrance "in antis" is an important typological feature of Syrian temples as early as the third millennium B.C. and temples of this type can be found in both Syria and Palestine throughout the second millennium B.C. The Tell el-Hayyat temples provide im- portant new information on the typological and temporal antecedents to the "migdal" or "fortress" temples at Shechem and Megiddo. However, the very presence of temples on a small (0.5 ha.) unfortified agricultural site is crucial to our understanding of the sociocultural conditions of cult. The Middle Bronze Age cultures of Syria and Palestine have been characterized as "urban," and large fortified tell sites have been identified as politically dominant regional centers. Most temples have been found on fortified tells, which suggests that a temple in a small village might have been an implanted "urban" institution from which the re- gional center controlled the village population. But was this indeed the case? Contemporary texts from the archives at Mari reveal a more complex relationship between political centers and village cult, while the texts from similar temples at Late Bronze Age Emar provide further information on the participation of priests, citizens, and ruler in cult activities.</page><page sequence="51">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 279 FOREIGNERS, GREEK WOMEN, AND THE USE OF AR- CHAIC IONIAN SHRINES: Christopher G. Simon, Uni- versity of California, Davis Analysis of the excavated sacred shrines in Ionia enables investigation of important questions about the function of early Greek sanctuaries, whether, for example, different shrines were important to different sections of the commu- nity and whether the function of each shrine was closely linked to its geographical position within the city or the sur- rounding territory. The pattern of sanctuary placement in Ionia may be compared with other well-documented areas, such as Sparta, Corinth and Attica. Ionia, like Athens, gives a major role to Athena Polias on the acropolis and, in both areas, there is evidence for possible political manipulation of the goddess. A contrast can be observed between those Ionian shrines placed inside and those outside the city. The former are sacred to deities familiar from the Greek mainland, in particular Athena Polias and Apollo Delphinios. The extramural sanctuaries, on the other hand, belong to deities more closely linked by their cult-titles to their controlling city, e.g., Samian Hera and Ephesian Artemis. The documented rituals and excavated votives of the extramural shrines point to considerable foreign influence and involvement. Comparison of the votives with those found in shrines within the city suggests that the extramural sanctuaries were also particularly popular with Greek women. The placement of these large shrines outside the city may be seen to serve several functions, on the one hand displaying the city's control of its territory but, at the same time, also mirroring the lack of status within the community of those most active in the cults. Both temple and worshippers, therefore, can in different ways be interpreted as being "outside" the city. RELIGIOUS PRACTICES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZA- TION IN PRE-ROMAN LUCANIA: H. Fracchia and M. Gualtieri, University of Alberta The archaeological record so far available points to the emergence of sanctuaries in the hinterland of Magna Grae- cia as a characteristic phenomenon of the second half of the fourth century B.C. This phenomenon may be placed in the context of a process of rapid evolution in social and political structures which the Oscan populations of Magna Graecia underwent in a response to close contact with the Italiote Greek settlements. The two types of sanctuaries so far documented reflect the influence of the Italiote cities in the plan and construc- tion of the buildings as well as in the ex-votos. Rossano di Vaglio is an outstanding example of the most monumental type of sanctuary which served as a religious center for a number of communities in a large surrounding territory. Serra Lustrante (Armento) provides an example of a smaller rural sanctuary at a crossroads. Both examples be- long to the category of hinterland sanctuaries in which the religious area would serve as a point of exchange as well as a political and administrative center for communities in the territory. More recent evidence from cult places within fortified settlements, such as at Roccaglorioso, presents clear docu- mentation of religious practices and structures embedded in the context of aristocratic oikoi in which the community or- ganization and cult practices have different characteristics than those associated with the regional or territorial sanc- tuaries studied to date. THE RURAL RELIGIOUS SANCTUARY IN EARLY CHRIS- TIAN IBERIA: Stephanie J. Maloney, University of Louisville From 1983 to 1986, the Early Christian church asso- ciated with the very large Roman villa of Torre de Palma, Portugal was excavated. The original form of the building was found to have been a large double-apsed basilica with a narthex. In form, it resembles three other double-apsed churches in Iberia: Vega del Mar, dating from the late fourth or fifth century; Casa Herrera, ca. 500; and El Ger- mo, ca. 600. On the basis of numismatic evidence, supported by ceramic evidence and the type of construction employed, the original structure is dated to the late fourth century. An elaborate baptistry and a second double-apsed chapel were added to the complex in the sixth century, after the villa had been abandoned. The Torre de Palma church, large and elaborate enough to have served as a cathedral in most parts of the Early Christian world, differs from the usual pattern of small, simple villa churches. Even as large a villa as that at Torre de Palma can scarcely have provided the congrega- tion for such a large and complex church. A serious discrep- ancy thus exists between the church, on the one hand, and its apparent social context-the villa-on the other. Two of the related churches are also rural. In pre-Roman Iberia there is a very strong tradition of rural religious sanctuaries of varying sizes. In fact, relatively few of the known sanctuaries or temples were associated with pre-Roman settlements. Examples of early rural sanc- tuaries are easily found in the region around Torre de Pal- ma. No more than 50 km. away, for example, a rural temple and sanctuary dedicated to "Endovelico" has been found. At Torre de Palma, foundations of a small Roman temple were found beneath the floor and walls of the east end of the church. The propensity for rural temples and sanctuaries seems not to have been lost even after Roman dominance was firmly established. The rural locations of the church of Torre de Palma and others of its type appear, therefore, to be representative of a carryover of the pre-Roman tradition into Romanized and even Christianized Iberia. GREEK "HEARTH-TEMPLES": AN ALTERNATIVE IN- TERPRETATION: Ewa Samuelsson, University of Stockholm The aim of this paper is to challenge the view of the Greek "hearth-temple" as the forerunner of the Greek tem- ple proper. In my opinion the "hearth-temples" are prede- cessors to official buildings for gatherings of a more profane nature, i.e., bouleuteria and perhaps more specifically pry- taneia. Without denying the religious significance of the</page><page sequence="52">280 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 "hearth-temples," the architectural features and the nature of associated finds share more with later prytaneia than with canonical temples. The architectural development during the Greek period at Kommos, Crete, provides a good illus- tration; for example, the interior hearth retains its fixed po- sition throughout the ages (essential for the hearth in pryta- neia), while the exterior altars not only change position but multiply as well, unlike the altars outside canonical temples. Moreover, the focus of activities is inside the building (hearth, benches, and other furnishings), whereas in a tem- ple proper the main religious activities are performed at the external altar. The addition of rooms is also uncommon in true temples-at Kommos (and Dreros) the "hearth-tem- ple" developed into a complex building more like later pry- taneia. The close link between the political and the religious aspects of Greek society is further reflected in the attribu- tions and character of certain deities, as seen in the cults of Zeus and Athena, and especially in that of Apollo, which has many striking functional similarities with the prytaneia. The architectural expression of the early Greek temple is more clearly illustrated at the Heraion at Samos with its fixed external altars, rather than in the so-called "hearth- temples." THE TETRASTYLON IN GREEK ARCHITECTURE: Fred- erick A. Cooper, University of Minnesota, Minnea- polis As an appurtenance to a cult statue, altar, hero, or vener- ated object, a tetrastylon became a form of sacred architec- ture in ancient Greece having an iconography of its own. Representations of tetrastyla appear in vase paintings and reliefs; they are attested epigraphically (often by the alterna- tive terms peristasis or ikira) and archaeologically (usually by no more than a set of column bases). The ancient name tetrastylon provides a crisp image of the architectural form: four columns standing in a quadrangle occasionally bearing an entablature but often freestanding. The ubiquity of tetrastyla in Greek sanctuaries has been overlooked by scholars except for a preliminary corpus by D. Rupp (in Appendix in Greek Altars of the Northeastern Peloponnese, ca. 750/725 B.C. to 300/275 B.C. [Ann Arbor 1975]). In modern literature the tetrastylon is often called a baldachin (M. Weber, Diss. Univ. of Frankfort 1982), a misleading term because the latter supports a canopy which belies the essential characteristics of the former, namely that it is principally a roofless structure which can hold on top sculpture or votive dedications. In this latter role, the tetra- stylon approximates the function of a votive column. This paper looks at unfamiliar examples of tetrastyla-the one which marks the sanctum sanctorum of Zeus Lykaios in Ar- kadia; a pair of tetrastyla in the sanctuary of Aphaia on Ai- gina-and, using pictorial sources, discusses the probable existence of a tetrastylon over the altar of Athena Polias on the Athenian Acropolis. The first of the pair of tetrastyla in the sanctuary of Aphaia existed in the temple, attested not only by a set of sinkings into the cella floor but also by a reference in IG IV, 39. The second tetrastylon at Aphaia encased the great altar where two bases remain in situ and a third has become dis- lodged (A. Furtwangler, Aigina [1906] 70-74, pl. 2, figs. 19-20). The three surviving bases share a number of dis- tinctive characteristics and allow for the identification of the fourth of the Aphaia quadruplets. It is "Base A" in the early sanctuary of Athena Nike, which underlies the Classical temple on the Athenian Acropolis (Travlos, fig. 201 and pace I. Mark, in Resumes. XIIe congres international d'ar- cheologie classique, p. 126). Historical circumstances place the arrival in Athens of "Base A" in the early 450s B.C. and I assume that the super- incumbent column came along with it from Aigina. But why did the Athenians choose a base and column to a tetrastylon as symbolic booty for their triumph over their long-standing rival? Herodotus (2.86-87) gives an insight into their cus- tom of capturing such columns and then converting them into commemorative monuments. ADYTA IN WESTERN GREEK TEMPLE DESIGN: CULT AND CONSEQUENCE: Susan Kallemeyn Thalmann, Hobart and William Smith Colleges A conspicuous feature of several Greek temples in South Italy and Sicily is the adyton, a room entered only from the cella and distinguished from an opisthodomos, which is ac- cessible from the peristyle. More than two dozen Western Greek temples of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. include adyta in their designs. Nineteenth-century scholars recog- nized the functional diversity of adyta, and the fullest study was made by Koldewey and Puchstein in 1899 (Die griechi- schen Tempel in Unteritalien und Sizilien [Berlin 1899]). Excavations in this century, however, have uncovered evi- dence which makes possible more firmly founded conclu- sions regarding the forms and functions of adyta. A comprehensive study of temples with adyta reveals a pattern of regional differentiation of form and function. In South Italian temples, adyta were used primarily for the storage of votives and ritual equipment and were not em- phasized in the total architectural design. Sicilian adyta were used primarily for the accommodation of cult images and were designed as the culmination of carefully arranged and articulated sequences of spaces and forms. These cham- bers provided impressive settings for images, and rituals in- volving significant numbers of people may have taken place in the temples. This pattern of regional differentiation is probably due to divergent sources of architectural influence, which encour- aged conservative and traditional forms in South Italian temples and innovative forms in Sicilian design. Differences in cults and cult practices were also an important factor in determining the form and function of individual adyta. SESSION VI D: CAMPANIA THE GARDENS ADJOINING THE SWIMMING POOL IN THE VILLA OF POPPAEA AT OPLONTIS: Wilhelmina F. Jashemski, University of Maryland</page><page sequence="53">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 281 The rooms of the east wing of the Villa of Poppaea at Oplontis looked out on an Olympic-size swimming pool (17 m. wide and 60 m. long) and two handsome gardens. To the south of the pool was a formal garden which could be en- joyed through the open windows of a beautiful diaeta. A unique garden painting, in which flowering shrubs and birds could be seen beyond a lattice fence, decorated the lower part of the exterior wall of the diaeta, extending the actual plantings of the garden. In the center of the garden, and on the longitudinal axis of the swimming pool, there was a shallow square marble pool in which stood a large crater fountain of white Pentelic marble, similar to those pictured in the garden paintings which decorated the walls of the small courtyard garden on each side of the large cen- tral hall in the east wing. At the south edge of the swimming pool was a sculptured marble group of a hermaphrodite and a Satyr. Along the east side of the swimming pool and on a slightly lower level than the preceding garden was a large and im- pressive sculpture garden in which an avenue of 13 trees has thus far been found. In front of each tree was a statue base; six of the almost life-size marble statues and herms which stood on them were found. We carefully emptied the tree root and other cavities of lapilli, studied the cavities, and then filled them with cement, making casts of the ancient roots. The sizes and shapes of the cavities, the soil contours of the individual beds, along with the identification of the carbonized roots, branches, and pollen now make it possible to identify the plantings of this beautiful garden, the first formal garden for which we have such plentiful evidence. The ornamental plantings of citrus and oleander trees be- hind the four statue bases directly opposite the large open hall in the middle of the east wing were carefully planned to provide a colorful and dramatic picture when viewed across the water from this room. Large platan trees on each side framed this beautiful picture. THE PRAEDIA OF JULIA FELIX IN POMPEII: A HISTORY OF THE EXCAVATIONS: Christopher Charles Pars- low, Duke University Few buildings in Pompeii bear the distinction of having been excavated as often and being as little understood as the Praedia of Julia Felix. The Bourbons first excavated this complex of tabernae, luxurious baths, and richly decorated garden dining rooms from 1755 to 1757. Before reburying the site, they drew up a numbered plan keyed to a list of the significant finds similar to the plan of the Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum. The paintings and statues removed at that time are now primarily housed in the Naples Archaeological Museum. Excavations in 1912 uncovered a previously unknown compital shrine, and the entire facade along the Via dell'Abbondanza was brought to light once again between 1933 and 1935. It was not until 1951 to 1952, however, that the building as a whole was reexcavated and reconstructed. Despite a relatively complete body of archaeological, artistic, and epigraphical material produced by these excavations, little of this has been carefully synthesized and published. As part of a complete study of the Praedia, this paper presents several architectural and artistic aspects of the excavations and the results of an initial examination of the site. Particular emphasis is placed on the value of the existing Bourbon documents as well as the unpublished finds of the later excavations in reconstructing the original appearance of the Praedia. OLD AND NEW EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL VILLA AT BOSCOTRECASE: Maxwell L. Anderson, Emory University Museum of Art and Archaeology The primary source for our knowledge of the Imperial Villa at Boscotrecase, near Torre Annunziata, is the excava- tion report by M. Della Corte (NSc 1922, 459-78); the monograph by Blanckenhagen and Alexander remains the standard reference work (P.H. von Blanckenhagen and C. Alexander, The Paintings from Boscotrecase [RM-EH 6, Heidelberg 1962]). Della Corte's floor plan and description of the villa are here translated into five new reconstruction drawings, which include views of individual walls extant at the time of the villa's discovery in 1903, and an overall axo- nometric view of the entire villa-based in approach on that illustrated in the recent publication of the Farnesina complex in Rome (I. Bragantini and M. de Vos, Le decorazioni della villa romana della Farnesina [Museo Nazionale Romano, Le pitture, II.1, Rome 1982]). The axonometric view incorporates most of the architectural and decorative features of the villa described or mentioned by Della Corte, including mosaics and the Second and Fourth Style walls in Peristyle B and Room 14 respectively. Reconstructions of the walls in Cubicula 15 and 19 illus- trate four previously unpublished sections of fresco in the storerooms of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. New reconstructions of the east and west walls of Cubicu- lum 19 differ substantially from Alexander's 1959 draw- ings, and are based on other Third Style interiors, such as that of the Casa dei Cubicoli Floreali (I.9.5) at Pompeii. The new reconstruction drawings thus draw upon the ex- ample of recent publications of Roman interiors, and in- clude previously unpublished material in an attempt at a systematic recreation of this important villa's original deco- rative program. Two TYPES OF BALNEA AND CAMPANIAN ORIGINS: THE EVIDENCE IN LATIN TEXTS AND ROMAN TOWNS: Ann O. Koloski-Ostrow, Brandeis Univer- sity Balnea, or small city baths, were for the most part pri- vately owned and run for profit. According to Agrippa's cen- sus in 33 B.C., there were 170 balnea in Rome (although none has survived), and their numbers increased dramati- cally in subsequent centuries. At Ostia, by contrast, about 20 small baths have been partly or fully excavated or are docu- mented by inscriptions. One curious feature of the balnea is an often close architectural association with apartments which surround them. First, our examination shows that there are two distinct types of balnea with apartments, a distinction which is new</page><page sequence="54">282 ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA [AJA 92 to bath studies. In the first type (exemplified in Ostia by the Baths of the Seven Sages [111.10.2] and Baths of Buticosus [1.14.8] and in Rome by the Baths of Stephanus [Mart. Epig. 12.52.4, sic quam sint Stephani balnea iuncta mihil), the baths are subordinate to the architecture which sur- rounds them. In the second type, the balneum is fully inte- grated within the residential building in which it sits (best demonstrated by the so-called Sarno complex at Pompeii [VIII.2.17-21], a six-story building of elegant apartments atop a bathing establishment, and by a bath referred to by Seneca [Ep. 56.1, supra ipsum balneum habito]). In general terms, the Campanian origin for bath archi- tecture has been well established. In the light of the Sarno complex, however, we reopen discussion of the much dis- puted location of Seneca's apartment "over a bath." Various details have suggested that the property must be in Rome, but the Bay of Naples cannot be ruled out. Although Sene- ca's apartment can never be located precisely, given a graffi- to, LVCIVS ANNAEVS SENECA (sic), which appears on a wall in Pompeii (CIL IV, 4418), it is tempting to suppose that Seneca's apartment, such an obvious parallel for the Sarno complex, may have been in or near Pompeii. Since we do not have physical evidence in Rome or Ostia for apart- ments directly over balnea, it seems reasonable to conclude that this second type of balneum with apartments clearly found its first architectural expression in Campania. THE FUNCTION OF THE THERMO-MINERAL BATHING COMPLEX AT BAIAE: Fikret K. Yegul, University of California, Santa Barbara The most extensive and important center of thermo-min- eral bathing in antiquity was Baiae. Located immediately northeast of the Bay of Naples, in the Gulf of Pozzuoli, Baiae and its environs, known as the Phlaegrean Fields, was once the staging ground of intense volcanic activity. Vitru- vius (2.6.2) gives a general idea of the bathing facilities that developed in this region: "In the hills near Baiae . . . there are places excavated to serve as sweating rooms. In these, hot vapors rising from below perforate the earth.. . and produce remarkably good sweating rooms." During the late Republic and early Empire, Baiae en- joyed great popularity with the Roman aristocracy. The ver- dant hills circling the beautiful bay were refulgent with lux- urious villas belonging to noteworthy Romans and the roy- alty. The first scientific excavations at Baiae, 1941-1943 and 1950-1951, under the direction of A. Maiuri, uncov- ered a veritable "thermal city." From the apparent confusion of the vast built-up hillside, it is possible to disentangle three major zones composed of terraces, colonnaded enclosures, pools, fountains, exedrae, and domed units connected to each other by stairs, ramps, and underground passages. The nature and the function of the hillside development at Baiae have generated considerable debate among scholars but have never been properly settled. The central question is whether these interconnected complexes are private resi- dences and villas, or curative public baths, hospitals, and hostels. A clearer understanding of Baiae will also elucidate questions on the origins of Roman baths and thermo-miner- al bathing. Based on archaeological and architectural con- siderations, I suggest that the hillside complex at Baiae was predominantly public in nature, combining the facilities of a medicinal center with those of a recreational one-not un- like some of the traditionally popular spas and thermal cen- ters of modern Europe. A WINE-MAKING PLANT IN POMPEII, INSULA 11.5: Jerome J. Rossiter, University of Alberta In 1954 C. Giordano's excavations in Insula 11.5 at Pom- peii brought to light the well-preserved remains of a small winepress (torcularium) and fermentation room (cella vina- ria), located in the southwest corner of the insula. Although Giordano's findings were briefly reported by W. Jashemski in connection with her subsequent investigations into the landscaping of the adjacent vineyard (AJA 74 [1970] 62-67), a detailed study of the press and its method of oper- ation has never been undertaken. With this aim, the torcula- rium was recently reexamined by the author as part of a broader study of Roman wine-processing facilities in Italy. The press itself is a good example of the type of platform press which was in wide use in the villas of the Ager Pom- peianus during the first century A.C. A close parallel is pro- vided by the larger winepress, now restored, in the Villa of the Mysteries (A. Maiuri, La Villa dei Misteri [1947] 96-104). A theoretical model of the mechanics of the press, based on the evidence of sockets and postholes built into the floor of the pressroom, calls into question the reconstruction of the presses in the Villa of the Mysteries, as proposed by Maiuri. The torcularium in Insula 11.5 is of particular in- terest in that the complete system of decantation is pre- served. This includes an unusual double collection reservoir, which can perhaps be seen as a forerunner of the system later described by the agronomist Palladius (Op. Ag. 1.18). Multiple outflow pipes allowed for the rapid distribution of the extracted must into dolia embedded in the floor of the fermentation room. Thus the building provides a rare illus- tration of Roman wine-making technology, where the entire process can be traced within a single, compact structure.</page><page sequence="55">1988] THE 89TH GENERAL MEETING 283 INDEX OF AUTHORS Each author's name is followed by reference to the page(s) in this issue on which his or her abstract is printed.
