<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH MANUSCRIPT ILLUSTRATION AND THE UTRECHT PSALTER* DIMITRI TSELOS HE uncertainty of our knowledge concerning the actual relation of the Utrecht Psalter to its English descendants is illustrated by the fact that the Psalter in Paris (Bib. Nat. MS Lat. 8846) which is usually attributed to Canterbury and about 1200oo has been called a copy of the Utrecht manuscript by one group of scholars or a copy of the Eadwine (or Canterbury) Psalter by another group.' Both these attributions are strictly inaccurate as I shall show later. This bold statement is meant more to dramatize the problem than to detract from the importance of the contributions of various scholars who have dealt with the larger subject of English manuscript illustration or with works whose relevance to the English schools is perhaps incidental.2 The purpose of this study is to analyze in some detail the relation of the Utrecht Psalter miniatures to their accepted English relatives and others less well known, in the hope of throwing additional light on the origin and development of English illustration during the Romanesque and Gothic periods without recapitulating unnecessarily the work already well performed by the scholars who have written on related problems in recent years. From previous studies of the problem one concludes that Anglo-Saxon manuscript illustration, which developed after the Danish invasion, seems to depend largely upon Continental models and especially Carolingian. It appears further that all the Carolingian schools-Ada, Metz, Tours, Reims, and St.-Denis---contributed something to the chief Anglo-Saxon schools or styles. The contribution of the school of Tours, however, would seem to have been made indirectly through the school of St.-Denis, which had made an eclectic synthesis of the most characteristic features of all the other Carolingian schools.3 It is through this intermediate channel that the stocky figures of Tours came into such works as the Charter of King Edgar.' Their short cropped hair and square jaws seem to have come from the same source. But the nervous activity of the figures, their linearized "impressionist" surfaces and the wrinkled sleeves and leggings represent the more distinctive contributions of the Reims manner by way of St.-Denis.5 From the latter school and that of Metz, best represented by the historiated initials of the Sacramentary of Drogo, comes the open framework with luxuriant decorative plants which appears earliest in the dedication miniature of the Charter of King Edgar and which was to become the most distinctive feature of the "Win- chester" style.' * This article is dedicated with respect and gratitude to Dr. Walter W. S. Cook on his seventieth birthday. Its preparation was assisted by a grant from the Graduate School Research Fund of the University of Minnesota.

The connection was first established by</page><page sequence="2">138 THE ART BULLETIN Similarly the miniatures of the Benedictional of St. Aethelwold also contain certain constituent elements of the various Carolingian schools.7 But there are at the same time some distinctive features in the drawing which suggest that its miniatures might have come also under the direct influence of the school of Reims. These are the sketchy undulating sky and ground lines and the more emphatic linearism of the figures, which are unlike the typical St.-Denis works or the products of other Carolingian schools that had undergone the influence of Reims. As has been pointed out earlier by other scholars, one cannot avoid the conclusion that works of some of these Carolingian schools were probably imported into England as gifts in official or social reciprocities between the English and Continental courts that were related by marriage. An alternative or complementary conclusion would be that they were imported in connection with the monastic reforms conducted by Aethelwold, Dunstan, and other important churchmen with the assistance of Continental monastic personnel and ecclesiastical tools among which manuscripts were undoubtedly the most important.8 Since the only Reims manuscript in the linear manner-which had much to do with condi- tioning the character of Anglo-Saxon illustration-known to have been in England is the Utrecht Psalter, it is tempting to attribute all the Reims features mentioned to that manuscript. The temptation is the greater when one looks at the Continental and English versions of the manu- scripts of Prudentius and Terrence whose reflection of the Reims manner is sufficiently unlike both the Utrecht Psalter and the Benedictional as to rule out the former works as possible carriers of the characteristics in question. But in the absence of more positive evidence of the existence of the Utrecht Psalter in England as early as the middle of the tenth century one cannot follow the temptation with cogent argument. There is of course no question about the presence of the Utrecht Psalter in England from about Iooo until 12oo and probably later, for it was used there as model for a number of illustrated manuscripts.! The earliest and indisputable instance of its direct influence appears in a "literally" illustrated psalter (Brit. Mus. Harley MS 603) which for convenience in this study I shall call the Harley Psalter. A brief analysis of the manuscript was made by Wormald, who classified the different hands that took part in its inscription and illustration."' I should like, however, to add a few observations concerning this work and its relation to the Utrecht Psalter which would help us in turn to understand their relation to other Anglo-Saxon works. In examining the miniatures of the Harley Psalter one is struck by the different interpretations which were made of the miniatures of its model. Hand D is obviously the most scrupulously imitative so that one who is not very familiar with the model and the copy could mistake the miniatures of one manuscript for those of the other. By the same token this hand is the least inter- esting although very informative on the capacity of some artists to copy with remarkable fidelity to the original. The most interesting for our problem is hand A, who is neither strictly imitative nor radically deviative. As may be observed from Figs. 3 and I I, he has the remarkable ability to alter the style of his model by subtly emphasizing or distorting certain features so as to translate the model's dynamic impressionism into an expressionist manner. His work brings to mind the turbulent landscapes of Van Gogh where the heaving ground acts as if the earth were in labor or The Scream O. Homburger, Die Anfdnge der Malschule von Winchester imn X Jahrhundert, Leipzig, 1912. Modern English scholars think that the "Winchester" style may not have originated at Winchester since it is characteristic of several other contempo- rary centers.

His expressionism is accompanied occasionally by some remark- able iconographic innovations that suggest an unusual imagination-unless these changes were suggested by a superior." We get some idea of this phase of his work by comparing the miniatures of the Utrecht and Harley Psalters illustrating Psalm 6. They are especially important because of their differences in illustrating verse 5, "In death there is no remembrance of thee." As seen in the Utrecht miniature the reference to death-like similar allusions elsewhere to the "fiery pit" or the "pit of Hell"-evoked a burning pit inhabited by snakes. Four winged demons at the rim of the pit are busy pushing the bodies of sinners deeper into the flames. Like the representations of other demons and of Hades in other illustrations of the Utrecht Psalter these are fundamentally anthropomorphic, despite their "flaming" skirts and hair, and in accordance with the classical tradi- tion out of which these infernal motifs grew." The corresponding scene in the Harley Psalter appears at first to follow closely its model except for the expressionist transformation of the style. But upon closer observation one seems to be witnessing the very birth of a new demonology. The Harley demons appear to be in the process of changing from anthropomorphic to zoomorphic types. The two on the left have one human and one bird foot with enormous claws. The other two have similar talons for feet, noses like elephant trunks, and large, pendant breasts and genitalia. There is something tentative about these transfor- mations which suggests that the illustrator's imagination was fired by the drama of the underworld and wished to realize its terrors more completely and explicitly. His demons were to be made more fearful to behold and more terrible to suffer under. The fact that these figures are fundamentally like those found in the Utrecht Psalter but changed only in the details mentioned, would suggest that the changes were the result of spontaneous individual inspiration. But the ubiquitous presence of zoomorphic hybrids in Anglo-Celtic and Anglo-Saxon initials may have paved the way for such transformation. I like to think that in looking upon the Harley demons we see the fountain- head of a new demonology which was developed in England and which spread to the Continent to affect the art of the later Middle Ages and eventually to influence even the demonology of Schongauer as Goldschmidt pointed out.3 There are a few other manuscripts-roughly contemporary with the earlier drawings of the Harley Psalter-in which the miniatures seem sufficiently similar to the style and iconography of the Utrecht Psalter to invite speculation on the possible derivation in part from this manuscript. One is the Liber Vitae and the other a Church Offices, both dating between 1020 and 1035 and apparently written for Newminster of Winchester."1 Their illustrations contain enough of the soft impressionist modeling of the Utrecht Psalter style in the figures and other peculiarities-such as the hunched backs, the forward-thrusting heads, contortions of the bodies and fluttering of draperies-as to suggest that their source was fairly close to the Utrecht Psalter. The scene of the contraposed demon trying to wrest a poor soul from the hands of St. Peter and receiving for his effort a blow with the key of paradise finds a remarkable counterpart in a similarly contorted and similarly occupied demon in the Reims Psalter (Figs. 5, 7). Since this latter motif was never copied ii. Unfortunately hand A illustrated only fols. I'-II V, 16 and 16v. 12. See the descendants of this tradition in the Vatican Greek Psalter (Bib. vat. cod.

Photos reproduced here, courtesy British Museum.</page><page sequence="4">140 THE ART BULLETIN in the Harley Psalter or any other manuscript antedating the Liber Vitae the uniqueness of the analogy with the Reims manuscript points strongly to a possible direct connection.1" The foregoing inference is strengthened considerably by the "Quinity" miniature of the Church Offices. This unusual iconographic complex whose synthesis was made from two different represen- tations of the Trinity in the Utrecht Psalter and whose iconological significance was first published by Kantorowicz, is very intriguing." The fact that all of its iconographic elements are found only in the Reims manuscript before I I50 raises once more the question whether the Winchester miniature was not inspired directly by the Utrecht miniatures. The same miniatures of the Liber Vitae and the Church Offices contain also an important iconographic element which does not appear in the Reims manuscript but which does appear in the earlier set of drawings of the Harley Psalter made, according to Wormald, "in the early years of the second quarter of the eleventh century" and therefore contemporary with the Winchester works (Figs. 7, IO)."1 This is the Hell Mouth in the form of a huge animal mouth opening upwards to receive the damned. As far as I know, there is no precedent for this animalized Mouth of Hell either in English or Continental works. In the Utrecht Psalter, as might be expected from its classical legacy, Hades, who occupies the pit of Hell, is always represented as a giant cannibalistic bust or head."* Iconologically the giant animal mouth could have been inspired by the many references of the Psalmist to the lion or mouth of the lion which is frequently equated with Hell.9 But it is not clear whether the head depicted is meant to be that of a lion or a whale. It is there- fore possible that the equation of the whale with Hell, as found in the Exeter Book and other similar texts, which developed further the early Christian symbolism of Jonah and the Whale, could also have played a part.20 Stylistically, however, the motif seems to have occurred earlier in an initial B in a Franco-Saxon Psalter of the ninth century now at Wolfenbiittel.21 The wide open jaws of the two heads which terminate the inner ends of the volutes of the initial and their sweeping contours and curved fangs are more suggestive of the jaws of a snake than those of any other animal. Nevertheless, except for the fangs, the abnormal distention of the jaws and the sweeping contours which enclose them reappear at their closest on folio 71 of the Harley Psalter, one of the pages contemporary with the Winchester works under discussion (Fig. io).22 The somewhat tentative and decorative quality in the Harley detail leads me to believe that it might have been the first instance of the transfer of the motif from a purely decorative function in an initial to an iconographic one, and that the more realistic representations of the same motif in the two Winchester works were later develop- ments.23 I5. The possibility that the Liber Vitae miniature of Heaven and Hell was in part inspired by the Utrecht Psalter is also supported by the analogies found in the illustration for Psalm 81 (82). Compare St. Peter at the gate of Heaven with the militant figure in the center of the miniature and the inverted figure in Hell with a similarly falling figure at the lower right of the Psalm miniature.

On the Exeter Book see F. J. Snell, The Age of Alfred, London, 1912, pp. i73f. On the prefiguration loc.cit. and Matthew 12:40. The possibility that the "whale mouth" may have played a part in the formation of the English Mouth of Hell is also suggested by the open and upturned mouth of the "whales" in the lower corners of the Utrecht miniature il- lustrating the Canticle of the Three Hebrews. See De Wald, op.cit., pl. 137. In this connection we must always remember the traditional inclination of Anglo-Celtic and Anglo-Saxon artists for fantastic heads in the monstrous hybrids which decorate many initials of the ninth and tenth century.

The former manu- script had been assigned to Winchester or to the "Winchester School" but it was, like the Bene- dictional itself, probably written at Ely as shown by Tollhurst." But its similarity to the Utrecht miniatures as seen by comparing the angel, from one of its miniatures illustrating the warning of the Magi not to return to Herod, with a similarly disposed figure and trailing scarf in the Utrecht Psalter is very suggestive (Figs. 8, 9). As in the case of the various elements that made up the Quinity of the Winchester Church Offices, the only existing model for the warning angel appears in the Utrecht miniatures. It was never copied or adapted in the Harley Psalter. If we add to this sample analogy the sketchier and more linear character of the Sacramentary miniatures as a whole- as against the Benedictional-the more violent activation of the figures and the angular sketchiness of the sky and ground areas, the possibility of its having been influenced by the Utrecht and/or the Harley Psalter should not be excluded. The earlier alternative attribution of the Sacramentary to "Winchester or Canterbury" by Kendrick may well have been based on similar considerations.26 Several other works in which the relation to the style or iconography of the Utrecht Psalter seems intimate enough to permit a speculation on a direct connection might be cited in the Appendix with only one pair of comparative illustrations. The citations, however, will be made to specific motifs and their analogues, which the interested reader may locate and examine himself. The apparently intermittent use of the Utrecht Psalter in one or more manuscripts over more than a century testifies to its importance and popularity as a model. Wormald, who classified the different hands of the illustrations in the Harley Psalter, assigned the second group of drawings, which seems to have been selectively adapted from the Utrecht miniatures, to the second half of the eleventh century which experienced a sort of "revival" of the Utrecht Psalter manner.27 The last or third major group of drawings seems to be iconographically related to the Utrecht miniatures. But stylistically they reveal a proto-Romanesque character, which appears to be not far removed from that of the Eadwine Psalter of which the miniatures constitute the only complete copy of the Utrecht Psalter cycle.28 Despite its completeness, which gives the manuscript some distinction, the Eadwine Psalter is the least original or creative of the progeny of the Utrecht codex. As has been pointed out by other scholars, the miniaturist attempted some important iconographic innovations in the first few illus- trations (Figs. I, 2) and some changes in details throughout. But for the most part he abandoned himself to a direct "copying" of his model in a much less distinguished style. In general, his other changes are characterized more by omissions than innovations. His style is rather dry and tight and monotonously stylized, with none of the masterful and imaginative changes that characterize some of the hands of the Harley Psalter. Among the few iconographic changes in details, the Eadwine illustrator introduced two versions of the Mouth of Hell, one of which is shown in the illustration for Psalm 6 where Hell was evoked by the text. In this version the inverted monstrous "lion" head is shown "full-face" (Fig. 2) and thus it is completely different from the profile type we saw in the Harley Psalter, feet of Christ in the Quinity, whose incipient claw-like feet, long nose, and flaming hair ally him to the devil in the Liber Vitae and to the Harley demons around the pit (Fig. i ). 24. The Evangelist Matthew and his Angel in the Besangon Gospels (Bib. de la ville, Ms 14. fol. 58v) were undoubtedly adapted from the "Blessed man" who meditates the law of the Lord according to Psalm i:i, as shown in the Utrecht and Harley Psalters. See Homburger, op.cit., pl. x5 De Wald, op.cit., pl. I, and Harley Psalter fol. iv. Wormald, op.cit., p. 49, quite properly associates the Gospel miniature with the Winchester works under discussion and dates it in the first half of the eleventh century. 25. Tollhurst, loc.cit. 26.

Dodwell traced the stylistic origin of the frontal animal head with distended mouth-and by implication also of its infernal form-to Greek coins repre- senting the head of a Gorgon." But I suspect that its immediate ancestry is more closely related to late Roman or early Christian representations of lion-headed waterspouts or masks as seen in architecture, sculpture and in mosaic decorations-even in Roman art in England.30 Its earliest appearance in Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination known to me is in an initial of an Anglo-Saxon Psalter of about 800 (Brit. Mus., Cotton MS Tib. c II) attributed to Canterbury.31 The presence of similar forms in Ottonian art would suggest its earlier decorative use on the continent.32 In a modified form, it is shown four times as a rapacious lion biting the corners of the frame in one of the miniatures of the Athelstan Psalter (925-940), whose English additions reflect more than a hint of proto-Ottonian style." Its most common version, however, appears in the center of a large illuminated initial B in the suggestive act of swallowing or disgorging the two vegetable loops that join with the vertical stem to make the letter. It is difficult to say whether this motif was invented in England or borrowed from the Continent. Both the earliest English example (Brit. Mus., Harley MS 2904) and the earliest Continental type (Gotha, Landesbib. I.Io) are dated in the last quarter of the tenth century and it is impossible to assign priority to one or the other." During the eleventh and twelfth century it becomes common in both areas but does not help us in determining its place of origin."5 There is, however, more certainty about the English origin or transformation of the detail to an important demonological function as the Mouth of Hell. It seems to appear about the same time as the similar use of the profile type discussed earlier in connection with Harley 603, the Liber Vitae, and the Church Offices of Winchester. The earliest approximation of the frontal type is found in what appears to be a "transitional" or compromised form-neither completely in profile nor frontally represented-in an Anglo-Saxon Psalter of unknown provenance or date (Brit. Mus., Cotton MS Tib. c vi) but probably dating in the second or third quarter of the eleventh century." Judging from the iconography of the scene of the Harrowing of Hell in which this Hell Mouth appears and from the linear drawing of the manuscript it seems certain that this work was made in an area in England that was influenced by the Utrecht Psalter directly or indirectly." The two types of Hell Mouth discussed became very characteristic features of English illumination in the eleventh and later centuries. Consequently they serve as the most important tracers of English influence upon later Continental painting and sculpture in themes of the Harrowing of Hell, the Last Judgment, or similar apocalyptic iconography." The last of the important descendants of the Utrecht Psalter in England was produced more than fifty years after the Eadwine Codex. It is now kept in Paris and I shall call it the "Parisian" Psalter to avoid the confusing infringement of the name of the more famous Paris Psalter of Byzantine origin that is also kept there." 29.

But a further comparative and detailed examination of some sample cases shows that the painter of the Parisian depended not only on the Eadwine but also on the Harley and Utrecht Psalters. He even made some important innovations of his own. The best demonstration of the eclectic creation of the Parisian may be made on the basis of the parallel illustrations for Psalm 51 (52) in the Utrecht, Eadwine, and Parisian Psalters and those for Psalm 6 in the Utrecht, Harley, and Parisian manuscripts. But the problem must be first stated in terms of two Reims works where the earliest extant illustrations for Psalm 51 were made. In an earlier publication on the origin of the Utrecht Psalter, I pointed out that the painted version of the illustration for Psalm 51 in the Troyes Psalter is more accurate than the corre- sponding picture in the Utrecht Psalter which used the same model.'4 The Psalmist in the center of the Troyes miniature (Fig. 18) holds in one hand an ancient razor and raises the other upward to the Lord and the "Righteous" about his feet, in order to protest the malicious act of Doeg, who went to tell Saul, that David had taken refuge in the house of Ahimelech. The razor is a simile for the sharp tongue of Doeg, which according to verse 2 "deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor working deceitfully." The mischievous act of Doeg is represented in the lower center, show- ing him stumbling with excitement, as he comes to tell his story to Saul, who sits at the entrance of his palace and is flanked by three guards. In complete accord with the illustration the Psalmist speaks as if the culprit were present. He pours his maledictions upon him and warns him saying that "God shall . . . destroy thee forever; He shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living." In the manner proper to the literal mode of illustration the threat is realized in a visual metaphor represented by a broken and up- rooted tree to the right of the Psalmist. Then speaking to the Lord and the Righteous he says: "Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness. But I am like a green olive tree in the house of the Lord; I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever." The metaphorical reference of the Psalmist to himself as a green olive tree is illustrated in the Troyes miniatures by a small living tree in the upper left corner of the illustration. The Utrecht Psalter miniature for the same Psalm, however (Fig. 12), contains two living trees, one on either side of the Psalmist on the same slope on which he stands, but there is no broken or uprooted tree to illustrate the maledictory threat of the Psalmist. The more logical differentia- tion of the two trees in the Troyes miniatures indicates that they were so differentiated in the model. But one of the clumsier hands in the Utrecht Psalter, the one that illustrated Psalm 5I and a few other adjacent Psalms, misunderstood completely the significance of the differentiation and rendered both trees as living. His incompetence is further revealed in the smudgy and less decisive drawing and above all by his careless conversion of Doeg into another guard, armed with a spear and standing in front of Saul. As a result of these errors the Utrecht miniature becomes an illustration of a dramatic trial in which the defendant is spoken to but he is nowhere to be found-not even metaphorically. For the same reason the presence of Saul and his guards becomes completely irrelevant. Yet the same errors are a blessing in disguise for the present problem, for the faithful descent of a defect is often the most reliable tracer of a family tree. If the reader will compare the Eadwine and Utrecht miniatures for Psalm 51 (Figs. 12, 13) he will note that the Canterbury illustrator omitted all the small vegetation and the small tree which was represented in the upper right of 40.

The omission of the tree must have seemed logical enough, since the text calls for only one living tree and the Canterbury illustrator chose the larger one at the lower level to serve as a simile for the Psalmist's goodness and faith in the Lord. But the choice of that tree, which has been erroneously rendered as a living form by the Utrecht illustrator, is in a sense a repetition of that error and confirms other evidence showing that the Carolingian manuscript was the model for the Eadwine Psalter. Further and stronger confirmation of this relation appears in the repetition of the erroneous transformation of Doeg into a guard, as originally made by the Utrecht illustrator. The same errors in the Eadwine and Utrecht Psalter will reveal the sources of the Parisian work. The juxtaposition of the illustrations for Psalm 51 as rendered in the Eadwine and the Parisian Psalter (Figs. 13, 14) shows their general resemblance in the location of the principal persons in the "trial" and condemnation of Doeg by the Psalmist. Doeg, of course, is still represented as a "guard" in the two miniatures-his real identity unknown to both miniaturists. But this similarity is not enough to prove a direct relation between the two miniatures since the same error appears in the Utrecht Psalter. In fact, a detailed comparison between the Eadwine and the Parisian miniatures shows that the latter could not have been copied from the former. In the Eadwine, Doeg overlaps the first column, whereas in the Parisian he stands clearly between the columns. The Eadwine shows only one tree, while the Parisian represents two of them planted closely to- gether near the Psalmist. The differences between the two Canterbury miniatures can be reconciled only by reference to the corresponding picture in the Utrecht Psalter which must have served as model for both the Eadwine and Parisian miniatures (Figs. 12, 13, 14). There we find the figure of Doeg between the first two columns in front of Saul, as in the Parisian miniature. There too are the two olive trees whose branches and undulating trunks are much more like those of the Utrecht Psalter than the unique and highly stylized tree in the Eadwine miniature. Thus the closer correspondence between the Parisian and the Utrecht miniature in two crucial errors is a clear indication that in this miniature, at least, the chief model was not the Eadwine but the Utrecht Psalter.4` But there are some significant differences too between the Utrecht and Parisian miniatures which indicate that the latter was modified by a partly new interpretation of the text of the Psalm. The change is illustrated in the lower right side of the Parisian miniature where we see a heavily draped and crowned figure tumbling headlong from a throne set in front of a monumental struc- ture somewhat smaller than the palace of Saul. This figure and building do not appear in any of the psalters we have discussed or any others similarly illustrated. They seem to be interpolations which an illustrator or editor might invent in order to supplement or rectify the incomplete or unintelligent illustration of which the deficiencies were caused first by the erroneous illustration of the Utrecht Psalter discussed above. The Parisian illustrator or editor might have wondered about the extra living tree in the Utrecht miniature and-in the absence of Doeg-the apparently irrelevant and unidentified King Saul and his guards. But he must have felt that he had to do something about that invisible villain on whom the Psalmist poured his maledictions. So he intro- duced the tumbling figure and his "dwelling place" out of which he is "uprooted" or "plucked" by the mysterious power of the Lord in accordance with the prophetic or wishful malediction of verse 5. But whether this figure is meant to be the historical Doeg or not is a question. Practically all that is known of Doeg appears in I Samuel 21-22. He apparently was an Edomite in the service of King Saul as chief herdsman, muleteer or "runner." It was he who betrayed Ahimelech, the 41. Several other details, e.g., the angels flanking the figure of Christ in the Mandorla, the leafy capitals of the palace of Saul, etc., suggest that the Utrecht Psalter was the preferred model. One notes also how the Eadwine omitted a small build- ing of the right side of the miniature for Psalm 3, but the Parisian reintroduced it by referring to the Utrecht Psalter.</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH MS ILLUSTRATION AND THE UTRECHT PSALTER 145 chief priest, to Saul, for having met secretly with David. It was he who at the command of Saul killed Ahimelech and his fellow priests and then destroyed their city Nob. It is possible that these deeds earned him the titles in the Psalm as "mighty" and "rich" but it is most unlikely that a patristic commentary on the Psalm could have elevated him to royal rank. The royal attributes such as the crown, robe, throne, and "palace" can be explained more easily by the analogous practice in some Utrecht miniatures where evocations of the "mighty," "rich," and "wicked" are rendered as crowned and enthroned figures in front of a palace.4" The interpolation of this figure then is clearly indicative of a new and supplementary illustra- tion of the text of the Psalm and thus a departure from the Psalter models. The departure of the Parisian from the style of the Utrecht Psalter is even greater. It is evident that the lyric and impressionist drawing of the Utrecht miniatures was not congenial to the massive and monumental objectives of the later Romanesque or early Gothic style, which was trying to realize its monu- mental forms by boldly converting the relative two-dimensionality of the earlier Romanesque and by fresh borrowings from the middle Byzantine style towards a new three-dimensionality. The Pantocrator type of Christ, which appears frequently in circular or semicircular enclosures, the physiognomy of this Christ and of that of most figures in the miniatures, the ornamented collars and hems of their drapery, the gored domes on drums and the gold background of the Parisian miniatures present incontrovertible evidences of such Byzantine influence." Additional light on the eclectic creation of the Parisian manuscript may be thrown by the com- parison of its miniature for Psalm 6 with the corresponding illustration in the Harley, Utrecht, and Eadwine Psalters (Figs. I, 2, 3, 4, I I). Although the zoomorphic character of the Parisian demons who push sinners into the Mouth of Hell is further developed through the acquisition of other fantastic appendages to their anatomy, their long noses, claw feet, and contrapposto move- ments suggest that the Parisian illustrator may have had also the Harley 603 Psalter before him (Figs. 4, I I). This belief is confirmed by the use in the Parisian miniature of certain other features the nearest counterparts of which are found only in the Harley miniature and not in the other two psalters under discussion which seem to have served elsewhere as models. These features consist of the scalloped or wavy skyline of the hill which frames the demons, the intertwining of the branches of the tree in the upper left hand corner of the miniature, and the nature of the beds on which two figures lie. The beds in the Utrecht miniature are an open framework with the mattress on top (Fig. I). Very similar in character are those in the Eadwine, which had been adapted from the Utrecht Codex (Fig. 2). But the beds in the Parisian are boxed in and the sides were decorated by some perforated or painted "border" design as in the Harley manuscript (Figs. 3, 4). The details of the border, however, are somewhat different in the two manuscripts as might be expected, for the Parisian illustrator never seems to copy exactly his models. Further comparisons of the parallel miniatures of the manuscripts in question will show that, in general, treatment of the ground line, mountain range, location of the trees and architecture the Parisian seems to follow the Harley manuscript rather than the other works. Still, as it is in the case with the illustration for Psalm 51, the Parisian illustrator always checked with the Utrecht Psalter miniatures and supplied from them buildings or trees which he thought necessary even though the corresponding miniatures of the Harley and Eadwine had eliminated them (Figs. 1-4).i 42. De Wald, op.cit., pls. 1, 12, 49, etc. 43. Most of the parallels point strongly to the Byzantine mosaics in Sicily but other areas may have played a part. Even if one were to judge from the only surviving portion of the murals of the Chapel of St. Anselm, it appears that Canterbury was not a stranger to high level Byzantine art around the end of the twelfth century. See the figure of St. Paul and the viper in E. W. Tristram, English Medieval Painting, of the Twelfth Century, i, Oxford, 1944, pl. 23; D. Talbot Rice, "The By- zantine Element in Late Saxon Art," London, 1947, pp. I6f.; L. Stone, Sculpture in Britain: The Middle Ages, Baltimore, I955, PP. 94f. 44. A case in point is found in Psalm 3 in which the Parisian seems to have depended strongly on the Eadwine for some in- terpolated iconography. But the Parisian reintroduced the building on the right side which had been eliminated by the Eadwine when it adapted the Utrecht Psalter miniature.</page><page sequence="10">146 THE ART BULLETIN There is another iconographic element in the miniature for Psalm 6 that distinguishes the Parisian from those of the other psalters we have been discussing. It is the giant Hell Mouth that fills the fiery pit and serves as a receptacle for the infernal churning operations of the demons we have seen earlier. Its profile appearance recalls the type represented in the Liber Vitae and the Church Offices of Winchester. But in specific details such as the sweeping calligraphic lines, the abnormal distention of the jaws and the continuous lines that run along the lips and from the eyes to the lower lip, it resembles the type illustrated in fol. 71 of the Harley Psalter (Figs. 4, io), which has already been discussed and which was dated by Wormald in the early years of the second quarter of the eleventh century. Although the Parisian uses elsewhere also the frontal type of Hell Mouth often found in the Eadwine, it seems to prefer the profile type probably because it is more effective stylistically and more expressive iconographically. From the foregoing discussion then, it appears that the Parisian is not a simple copy or adapta- tion from one model but depends on several sources and on occasion it departs from all to assert its own individuality and the spirit or style of its time.4" Consequently, the opportunity it presents- together with its various models-for detailed analysis of its miniatures to determine the degree of its dependence on, or independence from, its models is practically unique in the history of art and would throw considerable light upon the process of artistic creation in the early Middle Ages. The striking stylistic and iconographic analogies that were established between the Utrecht Psalter and a number of Anglo-Saxon works attributed to different centers, or as yet unassigned, raise an important question. Was it possible for the Reims manuscript to have influenced all these works directly or must one assume in each case a lost intermediary? The latter alternative-really several alternatives-strikes me as possible but unlikely because of the apparently remarkable consistency of fate in eliminating all such intermediate models and leaving only the "originals" and copies as unique testimonials in each case. In the absence, therefore, of such intermediaries, I would propose the theory that either the Utrecht Psalter was passed as temporary loan from one English monastery to another or that the illustrators of the derivative manuscripts went from their home base to the abbey that possessed the Utrecht Psalter to make sketches from its miniatures for immediate or later use. I did not say "owned," for, according to James, the manuscript was never recorded in the library catalogue of Christ's Church Priory as belonging to Canterbury because it was probably "a loan from some foreign house."4" The "foreign house" was presumably Continental and suggests that inter- library loans were probably more common than surviving records tell us.47 Similarly, if manu- scripts could be written at Canterbury for Rochester or for "some foreign purchaser,"48 there is no cogent reason why they could not also be illustrated for another abbey. It is even conceivable that a manuscript was written in one center and illustrated at another.49 We do not know how, when, or why the Utrecht Psalter was imported to England. But in view of its indisputable connection with the Harley Psalter which was begun in the early eleventh century, we may infer that it was brought to England at least as early as Iooo.50 The Harley Psalter was assigned to Canterbury by James1 on palaeographical grounds-"the round hand characteristic of St. Augustine's"-and on iconographical grounds to Christ's Church Priory by 45. In the light of the foregoing demonstration it is im- possible for me to entertain seriously the suggestion by Gold- schmidt (Der Albanipsalter, Berlin, 1895, p. I5) that an inter- mediate model might explain the differences between the Parisian and the other existing psalters that are proposed as models. 46. M. James, Ancient Libraries of Canterbury and Dover, Cambridge, Mass., 1903, p. lxxxiii. 47. We do not know how common such lending was among "foreign houses" but James (ibid., pp. xxvi f and xxix) infers that some books went from Winchester to Canterbury to assist in the rebuilding of the Canterbury library after the fire of Io67. For evidence on similar mobility of manuscripts see ibid., p. xxx, and his Canterbury Psalter, p. 4. Also Tselos, "Unique Portraits," p. z6z. 48. On works written at Canterbury for Rochester and even for a "foreign" house see James, Ancient Libraries, pp. xxx, lxxxii. 49.

James, op.cit., p. 532.</page><page sequence="11">ENGLISH MS ILLUSTRATION AND THE UTRECHT PSALTER 147 Wormald." The repeated use of the Utrecht miniatures as models during the remainder of the eleventh century and even in the early twelfth by the Harley Psalter would confirm both the Canterbury provenance of the latter and the continued existence of the Reims model at Canter- bury. The same facts might also lead to the deduction that the Utrecht codex went first to Canter- bury from its last Continental domicile. At the same time there is no reason to suppose that this venerable storehouse of rich iconography and expressive drawing would not be lent to Winchester, Ely, or other unknown centers that made the Calendars and the Marvels and thus account for the striking similarities I have pointed out between the Utrecht miniatures and those of those centers. Conversely, the strong similarity between the Quinity of Winchester and the corresponding motifs in the Utrecht and Harley Psalters would suggest that the illustrator of the Church Offices went to Canterbury where he could find both his models." The same alternative means of getting the Utrecht elements into the Ely (Jumieges) Sacramentary and in the miniatures of the Hymnal and the Marvels would also seem possible. Confirmation of the continued presence of the Utrecht Psalter at Canterbury-even if we allow for periodical loans to other centers-is clearly indicated not only by the intermittent use of its miniatures by several generations of the Harley Psalter illustrators but especially by its use in the Eadwine Psalter whose Canterbury provenance cannot be challenged. Finally the use in the Parisian of iconographic motifs which exist only in the Utrecht, Harley, and Eadwine Psalters would add strong weight to the generally accepted attribution of the Harley and the Parisian to the same center. From the partial adaptation and rejuvenation of the Utrecht cycle of illustrations in the Parisian Psalter around 1200 it might seem that the literal type of psalter illustration was destined for a longer career. But in reality the Parisian was the last important example of the type and even that was left incomplete. It was largely succeeded by other types dealing with the life of David or other events of the Old Testament. Yet one familiar with the multitude of striking motifs in the Utrecht Psalter miniatures can trace the dispersion of their motifs for another two centuries as noted in some details in the Queen Mary's Psalter (Figs. 17, 19)." The reader is invited to observe the grouping of the figures in front of a pavilion or tent and the two sanguinary scenes in the lower right of the Utrecht Psalter detail, which are virtually duplicated in the Queen's Psalter miniature: two men, one stabbing the other in the neck and receiving in return a thrust of the sword in the groin; and the murderous chain composed of three men on the right disposed in a similar manner except for the position of the lowest figure and the nature of the weapons used. Other motifs could be traced in other works in England and the Continent in the wake of the diffusion of the Utrecht Psalter iconography through English and continental works.55 But that 52. Wormald, op.cit., p. 69, on the basis of an initial on fol. 2, which shows an Archbishop wearing a pallium and lying prostrate at the feet of Christ, the patron of Christ's Church Priory. 53. The transferring of cycles of illustrations by means of sketching the elements of the miniatures in spaces reserved for them and finishing them later may be inferred from the in- complete or un-inked miniatures of the Harley Psalter and the inferred existence of such sketches under the miniatures of the Parisian, which were painted in Catalonia more than a hundred years after the first group was done at Canterbury. The group of seven miniatures painted in Italian-Catalonian style over the Canterbury sketches is clearly distinguished from the rest, which have no connection with the literal psalter cycle but which were painted at the same time and place. This, then, would seem to suggest that it was even possible for an illustrator to "borrow" motifs or miniatures from another scriptorium by sketching them in a sketchbook or in the manu- script for which they were intended and to finish them at his home base. 54. G. Warner, Queen Mary's Psalter, London, I912. The decapitation motif in pl. 87 would seem to be a confirmation of the suggestion that the double stabbing scene illustrated here was probably inspired by the Utrecht cycle. The pose of the executioner in the decapitation scene is more dramatic than efficient and had the same ambiguous significance from the time that it first appeared in the Septuagint illustrations and subsequently passed to the Utrecht Psalter. (See Benson and Tselos, op.cit., figs. 102, 104, or Tselos, The Sources of the Utrecht Psalter Miniatures, figs. 285, 287.) Because of its more dramatic and aesthetic character, the motif was often substituted for other decapitations in the miniatures of the Parisian (Omont, op.cit., pls. I8, 42) and appears in many other mediaeval works on both sides of the English Channel. 55. See the summary of the diffusion of the Reims style and striking demonstration of it in Morey, "Evolution of Mediaeval Style," ART BULLETIN, VII, 1924, pp. 35-50.</page><page sequence="12">148 THE ART BULLETIN task would be outside the scope of the present study and might be epitomized by a concluding statement by the late Adolph Goldschmidt: "Thus the Utrecht Psalter through its copies alone continued to exert its influence through five hundred years of artistic experience in the West and showed that the understanding of its conception by the Carolingians was not lost until the be- ginning of the Italian Renaissance."56 APPENDIX Some Problematic English Relatives of the Utrecht Psalter Among the less well-known relatives of the Utrecht Psalter are a number of interesting manuscripts. Two of them contain a series of calendar scenes or the Labors of the Months (Brit. Mus. Cot. Jul. A. vI, Hymnal; and Tib. B. v, "Marvels of the East"). As pointed out by others, their elaborate repertory of activities is unique in the art of the early Middle Ages. J. C. Webster, who has examined the illustrations at length (The Labors of the Months in Antique and Medieval Art, Princeton, 1938, pp. 53f., pls. 17-20), concluded that their faulty relation to the cycle of actual labors in Anglo-Saxon life indicates that the series must have originated outside of England. The similarity of several figures and ac- tivities to the illustrations of the Utrecht Psalter led him further to suggest that the prototype was probably a Reims manuscript. Moreover, on the basis of a com- parative examination of the two English series he inferred that the painted miniatures of the Calendar prefacing the Marvels of the East were copied from those of the Hymnal. Regretfully, I find it necessary to disagree to some extent with my former colleague. The fact that the labors do not correspond to the actual monthly labors in England need not be used as a basis for rejecting their possible origin in England. There is no place in northwestern Europe where plowing and sowing might take place in January-not even in Reims. As we can see by the parallel listing of the various activities in different countries and at different times, the monthly activities differ enough to suggest that individual varia- tions could be produced by accident or error in copying or moderate indifference to the local agricultural calen- dar-even in the English works in question as seen below. The possibility that there was a Reims prototype for the two English works is, of course, supported by the stylistic and pictorial conventions of the Calendars and their analogies with the Utrecht miniatures. But these analogies could be just as readily explained by the adaptation of the calendar motifs from the Utrecht Psalter after it came to England. In any case here are the most striking parallels: fol. 6 of the Psalter for the man swinging an axe at a tree (Hymnal, June); an- other with an axe overhead (Marvels, July); fol. 21, men with scythes, especially one sharpening his (Hymnal, July; Marvels, August); scenes of mowing, with the man blowing trumpet fol. 48 (Hymnal, August; Marvels, June); men working in vineyard and one "wrestling with vine" fol. 62v (Hymnal, Feb- ruary; Marvels, February); reaping with sickles and vintage scenes with coiling vines and two men with basket, fol. 73 (Hymnal, February and December; Marvels, February and December); another reaping scene with men carrying scythes and two others gather- ing grain, fol. 74 (Hymnal, March; Marvels, June). The same Psalter miniature provides another motif whose adaptation in both calendar miniatures is even more revealing of the process of creative adaptation (Figs. 15, 16). The man with a mattock or sledge- hammer who is attacking the personification of Israel standing on a mound, has been removed from his homicidal context by the creator of the calendar minia- tures and put in a more constructive agricultural job, that of reducing the spiraling mound of earth or hillock which has been borrowed from the left side of the Utrecht miniature and cut down to the size of the ambitious man now armed with a hoe. This process of adaptation, more than any other instance, tells us how the mediaeval artist selected his motifs, modified them, and placed them in a new context to serve a different purpose. Not every figure in the two calendars can be exactly duplicated in the Utrecht miniatures but they can be more readily approximated there than in any other manuscript. Two miniatures, one in the Calendar of the Marvels of the East and the other in the body of that book, are revealing in another way. The miniature for May represents a sheep-tending scene. There is a correspond- ing scene in the Hymnal for the same month. The gen- eral similarity of the corresponding scenes, the figure of the left shepherd, the sheep in the middle and the group of men to the right suggest that one miniature might have been adapted from the other or that both were adapted from the same model. But upon closer observation it appears that in this scene, the calendar of the Marvels is closer to the Utrecht Psalter than that of the Hymnal. The shepherd scene should be com- pared with the miniature on fol. 29 (Psalm 50 [ 51]) illustrating Nathan's accusation of David for having killed Uriah and taken Bathsheba and the related parable of the "ewe-lamb" (II Samuel 12) repre- sented at the lower level. I believe that the shepherd on the left of the Marvels miniature was adapted from the Utrecht cross-legged man leaning on a staff and that the man holding the lamb was adapted from the "poor man" holding on his lap the "ewe-lamb" in 56.

This motif of the holding of the lamb is com- pletely absent from the corresponding miniature in the Hymnal. Also, the arms and legs of the shepherd on the left in the Hymnal are not as close to the Utrecht Psalter as those of the Marvels figure. Before drawing any conclusions from the similarities and differences among the three works I should like to call the reader's attention to the miniature of the Marvels (fol. 87v) which represents Mambres at the edge of the Mouth of Hell occupied by a cannibal giant (presumably Hades) who is eating two figures and who is assisted in his infernal task by snakes and demons. There is nothing in the text to evoke these particular details in the scene. It merely warns that "in Hell there is nought of good, but great burning and the lake of perdition and darkness." It appears then, that the in- fernal beings were interpolated and, like the items in the sheep-tending miniature of the calendar, they point to the Utrecht Psalter as the immediate or ultimate source. The giant Hades and his lair seem to have been adapted from Utrecht miniatures containing personifi- cations of Hades and fiery pits with sinners and snakes. Specifically, the setting seems a modification of the left end of the miniature for Psalm I 15 (I16) and Hades after the figure of the Utrecht Hades consuming a sinner in fol. 78 illustrating Psalm 138 (139). In the same Psalter miniature we find also the tunic-dressed and book-carrying men who could have inspired Mam- bres holding his brother's book of magic which revealed the nature of the underworld to him. The rest of the details in the Mambres miniature find their best an- alogies in the Utrecht Psalter: fol. 33 for the sinners tortured by snakes and especially fol. 59 where the sinners are clearly drawn. In the same miniature we find the same type of demon in contrapposto intensify- ing the fiery torment of the sinners with his trident. One is tempted, like Webster (loc.cit.), to see in the Marvels calendar a copy of the Hymnal miniatures in view of their parallelism and the "earlier" character of the drawings of the Hymnal. But from the evidence of the sheep-tending scene it would seem that either the painter of the Marvels calendar copied the same model more accurately than the Hymnal draughtsman or he adapted his scenes from the Hymnal while having re- course also to the Utrecht Psalter for those motifs in the sheep-tending miniature that seem much closer to the Psalter than to the Hymnal. Direct access to the Utrecht Psalter is especially suggested by the Mambres miniature which could not have been inspired by some other source unless we presuppose still another inter- mediary between the Marvels and the Psalter. (Cf. James, Marvels of the East, Oxford, 1928, p. 3; Herbert, Illuminated Manuscripts, pp. 113-114; Millar, English Illuminated Manuscripts, I, p. 20.) Another work which seems to be directly or in- directly related to the Utrecht Psalter is the Psalter formerly owned by Jean, Duc de Berry (Paris, Bib. Nat. MS Lat. 8824). Its illustration consists of a series of vignettes incorporated in the text. Only a few have been completed. As noted already by WVormald their iconography is closely related to the Utrecht cycle. But their interpretation of the style suggests a period later than the first group of miniatures of the Harley Psalter. In fact, I find their closest relation with Hand E, dated by Wormald in the second quarter of the eleventh century. Some of the illustrations of this hand are in the same kind of vignettes consisting of two or three figures (Harley MS 603, fols. 53, 61, 70). The affiliation with the second group of Harley drawings is also suggested by the similar calligraphic drawing of the Mouth of Hell which is found in fol. 71 of the Harley work and which was drawn by Hand F. Similar affiliations be- tween the Berry and the Harley manuscript were noted also by Wormald (op.cit., p. 70). But on page 79 he suggests a more difficult stylistic position for the former by saying that it stands between the Winchester Quinity and the Psalter in the Vatican (Reg. Ms Lat. 12). The Berry vignettes are almost emblematic of the growing practice of isolating motifs from the larger collective illustrations of the Utrecht cycle and dispers- ing them within or about the text. One can trace the path of their dispersion by following certain striking details such as the Harrowing of Hell of Psalm 15 (16) in which Christ appears in a posture suggestive of an inverted U as he bends to rescue Adam and Eve. This motif appears in a Psalter of unknown provenance (Brit. Mus. Cotton Ms Tiberius c vI; Rice, op.cit., fig. 83a) and in a Psalter in the Boulogne City Library (J. O. Westwood, Facsimiles of the Miniatures and Ornaments of Anglo-Saxon and Irish Manuscripts, London, 1868, pl. 39). A Canterbury Gospel Book at the Morgan Library (Ms 777) seems to have appro- priated more directly some features from the Utrecht Psalter as I have tried to show ("Unique Portraits of the Evangelists in an English Gospel-Book of the Twelfth Century," ART BULLETIN, XXXIV, 1952, pp. 268f.). In these as in many other instances it seems reasonable to believe that even contemporary illustrators could draw their iconographic motifs from a common model yet remain stylistically more or less independent of the model and of one another.
