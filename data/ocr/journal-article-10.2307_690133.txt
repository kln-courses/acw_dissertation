New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1999. If you are going to a cocktail party and need a quick orientation in the Science Wars, consider this book. It is not for everyone. Norman Levitt's audience comprises those already positioned in the defensive trenches: no well-balanced, thoughtful, and subtle presentation here. Instead, Levitt will provide you with the ammunition of the. besieged: the factoid (what appears to be a fact, but isn't), a blunderbuss of rhetoric, the swagger of the bully, and a defensive line full of holes, non sequiturs, and double reverses. This is not to say that Levitt is unintelligent, nor that his position is indefensi- ble, but the intensity of his commitment to his idea of science does not mitigate the superficiality of his treatment of the issues or his flawed understanding of the concep- tual questions at stake. In short, count Prometheus Bedeviled itself as another casualty of the Science Wars, where reasoned dialogue has ceded to hyperbole and hysteria. The book's faults are of interest nevertheless, and it is worth a few words to explain how we have come to what appears to be a stalemate in discussions concerning the role and place of science in Western society. Prometheus Bedeviled, as virtually all similar diatribes, opens with an exaggerated assessment of the adversary position. Invoking science as the bulwark against the bar- barians, Levitt enjoins us to defend against all those attacking its sanctity. Fearful of a mob that neither comprehends nor appreciates the central role of the scientific world view in our society, Levitt draws a line in the sand and allows no crossover. Never mind that the critical discussions are highly varied in their intellectual and ideological commitments; Levitt assumes a defensive posture against all comers without acknowledging qualitative differences in the literature of science and technology studies. As in any field, there are crucial distinctions to be drawn, and by lumping together virtually all critics who question the image of the stalwart scientist as a</page><page sequence="2">386 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values disinterested seeker after objective truth, Levitt prevents a major intellectual contribu- tion from receiving a fair hearing. The fundamental issue in the Science Wars is the degree to which scientific find- ings-from theory to elemental fact-are "constructed." The issue goes back, at least in its modem formulation, to Kant, who in proposing that we know the world only in so far as our mental faculties allow, offered a philosophical constructivist theory of cognition. Our manner of perceiving the world and acting in it depend on the particu- lar character of our minds, and that world exists for us (i.e., can be known) as defined by those faculties of knowing. (Metaphysical realism was thus challenged, if not replaced, by the noumena-phenomena distinction.) We might concur that the degree of epistemological agreement between individual knowers must be very high (because of adaptive evolution, the commonality of language, and the overwhelming evidence of practice); yet, because of the "other minds" problem and the uncertainty of noumena, doors to skepticism and relativism have been opened. Science has, of course, always made a privileged claim on objectivity, but if one extrapolates the Kantian position from individual perceptions to instruments, on one hand, and social factors (including language, cultural values, political organization, etc.) on the other, then "constructivism" in science becomes a problem of degree. In short, the argument hinges on to what degree science's privileged epistemological position protects its cognitive content from contamination by confounding elements not factored into the calculus of ideal objective knowing. The constructivist quandary entered science studies through each of its three branches: history, philosophy, and sociology of science. When a logical structure for scientific discovery and verification seemed elusive at best (philosophy), and the his- tory of science seemed similarly marked by nonprogressive, nonrational models of growth, students of science paid closer attention to the social variables that might account for scientific practice. While a comprehensive description was hardly forth- coming, one major result from these studies was that science exhibited a construction of its knowledge in a fashion analogous to other forms of knowledge formation. While the natural sciences enjoyed a privileged epistemological standing, it was different in degree, not kind. Simply, science is in a trivial sense "social"; that is, it is a human activity, which draws on all those elements of our culture that support its enterprise. This is hardly contentious in itself, but the argument commences about the degree of construction that would be allowed for scientific practice and discourse. Into the fray, Levitt mounts a two-pronged attack against those whom he believes have burdened science too heavily with constructivist baggage. The first is philosoph- ical: scientific method confers some ideal objectivity, and thus the conceptual content of science is autonomous. The second is political: science must, at all costs, be pro- tected-and promoted-as the exclusive domain of those who fully (too often uncriti- cally) appreciate its apical standing. The two issues are deeply connected, but any dis- cussion that attempts to understand what science is and how it functions must first attempt to tease apart the interconnections and then see how they support each other, on what they stand, and how they might fail. Despite these interconnections, Levitt's primary concerns are pragmatic, not philosophical. On his view, society is the beneficiary of scientific advance, but any</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 387 assaults on its august position weaken science's ability to function. Evidently, Levitt cannot understand how science might indeed benefit from critical comment. Here, I believe, is the crux of the matter. Levitt apparently views any criticism that would dis- lodge his vision of a bona fide science as detrimental. While one might consider some critical comments as stupid, others as irrelevant, and still others as insightful, Levitt seemingly cannot differentiate between them to glean insight into the complexity of scientific practice and the basis of its hold on reality. If one is satisfied with the scien- tific product without understanding its formation, then one is forfeiting a crucial part of science itself. Students of science by and large share the same general goals and attributes as natural scientists; the trick is to engage those who deserve attention. At another level of discussion, many different activities that Levitt conflates under the rubric of science must be disentangled: technology, medicine, application to the law, and, even more immediate, research as opposed to science. If we take science as some platonic ideal of human inquiry, detached and objective, then research is "uncer- tain; open-ended; immersed in many lowly problems of money, instruments, and know-how; unable to differentiate as yet between hot and cold, subjective and objec- tive, human and nonhuman" (Latour 1999, 20). Science studies has shown us this dis- tinction between science and research and has coupled its findings to those from the philosophy of science that has disabused us of any notion that science functions according to some positivist, normative epistemological ideal. Simply put, the fortress Levitt defends is a mythic construction. Science is highly heterodox in its methods and objects of inquiry, employing different logical and meth- odological strategies, and endlessly complex as a social institution, beholden to a vast array of economic and political interests. Levitt assumes an insularity and normativity of scientific practice that is naive in the extreme. He might better have discussed defin- ing the epistemological parameters of knowledge and asking why scientific inquiry cannot be formalized and how scientific change might be better understood. For instance, even though I might disagree with the arguments of Susan Haack (1998), at least in her work, despite the same passionate embrace of a position close to Levitt's, she engages the debate with a sophisticated understanding of the philosophical issues at stake. Levitt does not. For example (I have had to choose only one of a myriad), when he laments the lax use of Thomas Kuhn's notion of "paradigm shift" (p. 201) by science critics, no corrected version is offered. Instead, Levitt simply refers the reader to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions for its elucidation, which those with any knowledge about the history and philosophy of science in the past thirty years would regard as an ironic joke. Levitt is apparently oblivious to the accepted plasticity of the concept and its elusive meaning. Long ago, Margaret Masterman (1970) showed that paradigm was used in no less than twenty-one different senses in The Structure, and Kuhn himself lamented, in the writing of the postscript of The Structure's second edi- tion, the nebulousness and circularity of the term. Both within the discipline of philos- ophy of science and in the wider culture, "paradigm" has assumed multifarious mean- ings and significance, which simply points to the power of this terminology to tap into a wellspring of complex and as yet unresolved questions about the nature of science. Levitt makes no contribution to understanding the issues raised by Kuhn, the reaction</page><page sequence="4">388 Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values to them, or the challenge offered by the various concepts that emerged from the ensu- ing debate. Perhaps one should not judge Levitt as a philosopher, but it is not too much to demand that he at least be thoughtful and not dispense with philosophical questions with a ready reference that evidently he himself does not understand. If we generously consider Prometheus Bedeviled as a wider commentary, let us review a typical chapter, "Health," to examine how Levitt proceeds. He asserts that scientific medicine is under siege by proponents of alternative medicine. Never mind that Levitt does not (probably cannot) define "alternative medicine," he sees the ascendancy of public support for clinical nonorthodoxy not only as a sign of science in retreat but also as an alarming public health menace. The "argument" is tortured, but it goes like this: charlatans, like Deepak Chopra, are selling the public a bill of goods that are a mixture of religious and folk beliefs, with some pseudoscientific buzz words, so that the gullible seek in such approaches a reconstitution of their spiritual and material selves. Sidestepping the reasonable allure of such a goal, Levitt again ignores the complexity of the issues he is raising-the nature of healing as both a physiological and psychological/cultural process-and places illness solely within the province of scientific medicine. Levitt sees this as an (exaggerated) opportunity for the forces of antiscience to gain momentum and sweep aside the standing of con- ventional medicine. This is myopic in the extreme. There are, to be sure, potentially dangerous outcomes in alternative clinical approaches, and we must be alert to them. Despite Levitt's dismissal of the federal investigation of alternative medicine as spurious and wasteful, it is a fact that such options are actively being pursued by the public. It does no service to ignore the ques- tion. Not only should the safety of alternative approaches be assessed, we must also understand the extent to which such therapies are effective and, if so, why. If any effi- cacy is demonstrated, the scientifically curious should undertake the effort to decipher such anomalies. Simply denying the legitimacy of such practices is hardly consistent with the open-mindedness supposedly characteristic of the scientific mentality. That being said, by and large, the efficacy, if any, of such therapies is most likely achieved through the placebo effect, and from this perspective, the entire issue raised by this poorly understood phenomenon deserves serious attention on its own merits. Physi- cians have long recognized placebo effects in the conventional setting, and thus this is a legitimate scientific problem. In short, in contrast to Levitt's torch and burn strategy, I would advocate sorting out the social issues and focusing on the interesting ques- tions clinical scientists should address as part of their own concerns. Levitt goes on to the second stage of his analysis of medicine by reviewing its sociopolitical history in the United States, specifically the political-economic struc- ture of medicine's ruling elite, the recent loss of public trust, and the black-box char- acter of the clinician's technical tools, locating in all of these factors elements that conspire and aggregate to work against the scientific ethos of medical practice. Cou- pled to these forces, the public's awareness of scientific uncertainty conjoins to under- mine the legitimacy of the scientific approach. Levitt views all of this as playing out on some basic irrationality. Here, the structure of his thought is revealed, one focused on combating what he perceives as a deeply embedded counterforce to science, not because of any weakness in the philosophical strength of the scientific outlook but</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 389 rather because he would "acknowledge that some law of intellectual entropy may be a given of the human condition" (p. 206). Medicine is in particular danger, because times of pain and fear of death "seem to call forth aspects of our mental proclivities that work at cross-purposes to logical and systematic thought" (p. 209). According to Levitt, this is but the most dramatic consequence of our intrinsic irrational, antiscientific characters. On this view, science is indeed precious and precariously holding the forces of darkness at bay. I very much doubt that Levitt can be converted from his worldview, one that I regard as leaving little room for free play of ideas and conflicting points of view. I would simply opine in this regard that science is far more robust than Levitt allows, for the very testimony he gathers for science, its undeniable successes and future prom- ise, denies his pessimistic thesis. But I will not further argue this perspective, nor defend my ultimate optimism. I will instead close by pleading for the democratic credo Levitt himself espouses. He correctly begins his essay by joining science with democracy as the mainstays of Western civilization he would champion. Science indeed grows from the same liberal tradition that spawned democracy, and the pre- cepts holding them together are the fundamental and tenacious grip of open and free discourse, an uncompromising requisite for both arenas. The untoward consequences of the Science Wars is that the rhetoric has too often become virulent, reflecting how the emotions of the disputants hold sway over their putatively rational arguments. De-escalation is in order. We require less noise and better articulation to combat the deafness that has ensued as defensive walls have grown too high and too thick. Prome- theus, bedeviled or otherwise, cannot be freed without honest brokering. Levitt might well have applied his effort to these better ends, placing himself within the discussion, not outside it.
