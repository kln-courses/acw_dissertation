<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradigm Shift in Plot Models: An Outline of the History of Narratology Ruth Ronen Poetics and Comparative Literature, Tel Aviv The short history of narratology (i.e., narrative theory inspired by classical structuralism) has proven to be long enough for the disci- pline to undergo some substantial paradigmatic changes. Further- more, although on the surface narratology manifests a relatively co- herent and almost monolithic theoretical project, it includes in fact diverse methods and orientations. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of a paradigm change in narratological models of plot and to describe it in terms of shifts within the range of con- ceptualizations available in the formalist-structuralist tradition. More specifically, this paradigmatic change consists of a shift from structural descriptions of action-structures in classical structuralism to semantic descriptions of narrative modalities in recent developments in narra- tology. Yet this shift should not be described as a punctual transition but as a dialectical development, leading from the earlier ideology of classical structuralism to the gradual domination of semantics in nar- rative theory. To delineate this paradigm shift, a twofold argument will be put forward: (1) In theory, the concept of plot appears in classical structural- ism as part of the attempt to describe the action-scheme in narrative texts. In practice, however, structuralist plot models address a more comprehensive object and much broader questions.

It shows that semantic considerations have permeated struc- turalist models from an early stage and that these models have aimed at attaining a different explanatory power than was officially claimed. Structuralism has thus expressed a range of problems and questions signalling the inevitable need for changes in paradigm. (2) Plot models constructed within the framework of a narrative semantics seem to reflect a conceptual shift in narratology, yet they actually revolve around old problems which traditional plot models addressed but failed to solve. When the constraints of classical struc- turalist ideology were lifted from narrative theory, the shift to seman- tic systems became an inevitable sequel. As a point of departure for defining the conceptual framework in which narratological models of plot can be considered, I will first refer to Genette's insights on the matter: There is room for two narratologies, one thematic in the broad sense (analy- sis of the story or the narrative content), the other formal or, rather, modal (analysis of narrative as a mode of "representation" of stories, in contrast to the nonnarrative modes like the dramatic ... ). But it turns out that analyses of narrative contents, grammars, logics, and semiotics have hardly, so far, laid claim to the term narratology, which thus remains (provisionally?) the property solely of the analysts of narrative mode. (1988: 16)1 Genette's distinction between a narratology that studies narrative contents, grammars, logics, and semiotics and a narratology that studies the narrative mode (indications of the presence of a narrator) is linked in his conception to the attributes "thematic" and "formal- modal," respectively. Genette's words, first, reflect uncertainty about what "narratology" as a field-name within narrative theory is all about (one would intuitively assume that narratology has more to do with grammars and logic than with narrative modes). This uncertainty partly explains why drawing a conceptual line linking structuralism and recent developments in narrative semantics might be of use in delineating the boundaries of this field. Second, Genette might have chosen to refer here to two possible narratologies only heuristically (to back up his view that the term "narrative" should be saved for "mode" only); in any case this methodological partition does not really hold. A glance at theoretical works as distinct as Barthes's "Introduc- tion" (1966a) and Pavel's move grammar (1985) clearly shows that narrative semantics, logics, and grammars are preoccupied with modal categories and that narrative modes are necessarily being incorpo- rated into formal story-grammars.2 Narratology, therefore, has to be 1. The claim to the term "narratology" is more widespread than Genette here argues, as attested, for instance, by Todorov's Grammaire du Decameron. 2. Barthes's level of actions, for instance (which is basically similar to the concept</page><page sequence="3">Ronen * Plot Models 819 considered as a field covering both narrative contents and narrative modes, and the possibility for mapping the various concerns and inner branchings of narratology must be located elsewhere. Every narrative text (transmitted through a narration) represents a sequence of events. It is commonly agreed that only events tied together by chronology and causality can form the basis for a narrative text (chronology is probably enough for narrative but not for story). Some causally connected event-sequences create an action-structure (they form a functional whole), while other event-sequences do not obey a functional principle. Among events that create an action- structure, some have a point and some do not.3 I will claim in what follows that plot models in theory describe how events constitute an action-structure (a functional pattern of events), while in practice these models incessantly express the need for investigating and explicating the narrativity of the action-structure or, in other words, what turns an action-structure into a story (that is, an action-structure with a point). Below, I will describe three types of problems that emerge fromn classical structuralism and from plot models in general, problems fcor which the semantics of narrative texts has in recent years outlined possible solutions. (1) The problem of defining the object of investigatio ofo narrative theory: Does narrative theory pretend to supply the sufficient condi- tions for producing a narrative text, or does it address only one aspect of narrativity (the necessary level of events-scheme or of an action- structure)? The isolation of the action-stratum in the narrative text necessarily raises some doubts regarding the status of plot models. In section A, the prevailing ambivalence in narrative theory regarding its object of investigation will be described. This ambivalence seems, in principle, less problematic for narratology based on narrative seman- tics, where semantic concepts and laws are combined with syntactic categories, thus circumventing the isolation of the action-stratum. (2) The problem of segmentation and of defining the narrative unit provoked critiques of the structuralist paradigm. Within narrative semantics, the narrative segment is presented as an intersection or as a complex of syntactic and semantic rules. Regarding the narrative seg- of narrative domains further elaborated and developed in Pavel), is closely tied with modal notions (although semiconsciously), which are thus being incorporated into the grammar of a narrative. (enette is thinking, of course, of mode (there is a narrator) and not of modali- ties in the semantic sense, yet narrative domains are surely one possible result of narrating a chain of events and are hence pertinent to Genette's narratology of modes. 3. The point of a narrative is a notion similar to the evaluative Junction in Labov (1972); it refers to the way a story indicates its aim, purpose, meaning, etc. See also Shen (1985) and Prince (1982).</page><page sequence="4">820 Poetics Today 11:4 ment not as an autonomous syntactic category but as a locus where all narrative levels intersect solves in some senses the problem of defining narrative units. (3) The problem of describing the principle dominating narrative organizations is demonstrated in the structuralist attempt to define a narrative logic based on a unique principle of organization connecting thefacts of the narrative world (events). This conception is replaced in narrative semantics with one whereby narrative structure is presented as a structure of alternative courses of actualization. This theoretical reorientation creates a more flexible and dynamic view of the structure of plot. Sections A and B, therefore, will observe a dual point of view: on the one hand, it will be claimed, narrative semantics solves some of the problems raised in the heyday of structuralism by introducing a new paradigm into narrative theory; on the other hand, narrative seman- tics will be presented as a direct continuation of the conceptual line and of the type of questions expressed in the early structuralist phase. A. Plot Models and Their Object of Investigation Plot has always been a central concept in narrative theory. This trivial observation actually reflects a complicated state of affairs in narra- tology. Narratology interprets the centrality of plot in two different ways: First, plot can be considered central to any description of narra- tive texts because it is assumed that the action-core of narrative texts can be isolated and analyzed.4 Such an interpretation orients narrative theory toward isolating the narrative core or scheme from other, nar- rative or non-narrative components. In a typical phrasing, the minimal definition of a narrative is "the representation of at least two real or fictive events or situations in a time sequence, neither of which pre- supposes or entails the other" (Prince 1982: 4). This definition ties the concept of narrative to the presence of an event-sequence or to the representation of a process of change. In this respect action, or plot in the restricted sense, forms the minimal and necessary condi- tion for producing a narrative text. The second interpretation of the centrality of plot manifests the dominance of an Aristotelian orienta- tion in narrative theory. Here, plot, as the domain of action in narra- tive texts, is situated as a superordinate of character and of thought. When plot is tantamount to an action-structure, it points not only to action's centrality in the definition of narrativity, but to the role of the action-domain in organizing the narrative text as a whole. Plot 4. TFhis interpretation is one that meets Genette's notion of narrative contents: story considered in itself regardless of medium of transmission. Yet, as shown below, narrative models are never concerned just with an event-scheme.</page><page sequence="5">Ronen * Plot Models 821 is perceived as an overall organizing principle, and it is assigned the dominant organizing function and the power of narrativizing other textual components. These two interpretations of plot's centrality in narrative theory produce a gap between minimal definitions of narrative, as an abstrac- tion and reconstruction of causally arranged events, and the structur- ing functions attributed to that narrative core whereby plot is defined as a principle of organization, "the intelligible whole that governs a succession of events in any story" (Ricoeur 1981: 167). This discrep- ancy reflects the problematic place assigned to the concept of plot in narrative studies, and it is, in turn, reflected in the actual use to which the concept of plot is put in narrative theory.5 This discrepancy is well demonstrated in Prince's recently published dictionary of narra- tology (1987), where the concept of plot is defined both as "the main incidents of narrative" and as "the global dynamic (goal-oriented and forward-moving) organization of narrative constituents which is re- sponsible for the thematic interest (indeed, the very intelligibility) of a narrative and for its emotional effect" (Prince 1987: 71-72). The apparent disjunction between these two interpretations of the concept of plot is, however, reconciled in the object of investigation of plot models. Plot models claim to describe the movement from event- sequences to action-structures; in practice they attempt to address the question of how a sequence of events turns into a story. To put it dif- ferently, the question that structuralist plot models have addressed is that of the value added to a set of narrative microunits which trans- forms this set into a narrative whole-a story.t6 In this respect the object of investigation of plot models merges the two interpretations of the concept of plot. Even when plot is identified with a scheme of events reconstructed from the narrative text, such a reconstruction already presupposes a preprocessing and an overall view of the narrative. Plot, even in its minimal sense, is the outcome of narrative understanding. Thus, defi- nitions of plot, ranging from the Aristotelian tradition, which situates action above other story components, through formalist dealings with narrative organization, to structuralist attempts to grasp the logic of narrative, all reflect a belief in the cohering power of plots. As it turns out, plot models make a distinction between the minimal occur- rence of an event-sequence in a narrative and the sufficient conditions 5. It is clear that a theorist like Ricoeur does not identify himself with the narra- tological project, quite the opposite. Yet his writings also manifest the same symp- tomatic unclarity about whether narrative theory should account for necessary or sufficient conditions forI narrativity. 6. Note, again, that many (quasi-)structuralists would agree that the (zero-)trans- formation of an event (or set of events) would yield a story.</page><page sequence="6">822 Poetics Today 1 :4 for narrativity. They attempt to accommodate, through the concept of plot, a much wider range of narrative phenomena: (1) the type of organization by virtue of which the narrative, in its totality, is given a form, that is, narrative organization should account for the genera- tion of events and for the dynamics of narrative progress from the beginning through the middle to an ending; (2) the way in which the narrative text incorporates into its structure elements which are not connected or not subordinated to the event-sequence (descriptions, non-narrative propositions, nonactualized events). Plot as the object of narratology is actually treated as a conceptual equivalent to narrative logic and to the outcome of narrative under- standing. This has been noticed by Ricoeur, who uses his observation to subvert structural narratology: The term "plot" does not appear in the technical vocabulary of narrative semiotics. In truth, it could not find a place there, since it stems from the narrative understanding which semiotic rationality tries to provide an equivalent for or, better, a simulation of. (Ricoeur 1985: 52) The discrepancy between necessary and sufficient conditions for nar- rativity is consequently motivated in terms of the intended object of plot models. Note that despite an almost compulsive tendency to set up and define elaborate terminologies in narrative theory, the concept of plot (and also of story and narrative) is often used obscurely enough to camouflage that discrepancy.7 In any case, the notion of minimal story has to be distinguished from those features in terms of which the quality of stories as stories is judged (Rimmon-Kenan 1983: 18). Prince, who in many ways represents the mainstream of narratology, claims that the narrativity of stories does not derive only from the existence of a minimal sequence of events. The latter is a necessary condition, but there are degrees of narrativity and, by itself, the fulfill- ment of the necessary condition does not yield a high degree of narra- tivity. Narratives of high narrativity "will not merely describe change and its results but fundamental changes and results. They will take us from the origin to the conclusion . . . from the onset of heterogeneity and difference back to homogeneity and indifference" (1982: 153). Beyond what narratives have in common (a minimal action-structure), and even beyond features which account for the specificity of any given narrative, there are, according to Prince, degrees of narrativity; there is the distinctiveness of narrative determined by nonformal criteria, such as wholeness, the point of the narrative, orientation, etc. Prince's full exploration of the concept of narrativity implies that narratology 7. Typical examples to this effect are Culler (1975) and Foolan (1988), where plot structure is undefined, and where the concept of "plot" seems to be used in referring to a narrative logic or rationale of an intuitive nature.</page><page sequence="7">Ronen * Plot Models 823 has to cope with the narrativity of texts defined on a wider scale than what classical structuralism indicated as its formal object of analysis. "Plot" is used to refer to more than just a representation of a process of change in narrative texts. Indeed, if one considers the kind of theoretical problems that plot models claim to solve, one finds that concepts like "plot," "fabula," and "narrative macrostructure" are ways in which narrative theory attempts to explain how plot structure is responsible for imposing order and for organizing meanings in narrative texts.8 Moreover, plot is perceived as an organizing principle in terms of which the aes- thetic organization of a narrative text is differentiated from reality. Plot turns an agglomeration of materials into a closed and signifi- cant narrative structure. This presupposition, reconstructed from plot models, that plot is a pivotal concept to which all narrative compo- nents are subordinated is a curious one, implying that it is not the nature of event-sequences with which plot models are preoccupied; this presupposition is also incommensurable with explicit statements of purpose expressed in structuralist models. Thus Bremond (1980) concerns himself with and dedicates his model of narrative logic to "the logical constraint that any series of events, organized as narrative, must respect in order to be intelligible." Yet, the status of his central objective is put in doubt when he claims: All narrative consists of a discourse which integrates a sequence of events of human interest into the unity of a single plot. Without succession there is no narrative. . . . Neither does narrative exist without integration into the unity of a plot, but only chronology, an enunciation of a succession of uncoordinated facts. Finally, where there is no implied human interest (narrated events neither being produced by agents nor experienced by anthropomorphic beings), there can be no narrative, for it is only it relation to a plan conceived by manI that events gain meaning and can be organized into a structured temporal sequence. (Bremond 1980: 390 [my emphases]) This conception of plot as an order-imposing principle, a principle of coherence in the face of a variety of meanings and a patternless world, is a conception that recurs, in diverse phrasings, in all attempts to cope with narrative structures in general and with plot structure in particular. Malmgren (1988) claims that a fictional world is com- posed of two fictional systems: world and story. The relation between these two components is analogous, according to Malmgren, to the 8. "Plot . . . is the organizing line and intention of narrative, thus perhaps best conceived as an activity, a structuring operation elicited in the reader trying to make sense of those meanings that develop only through textual and temporal succession" (Brooks 1984: 37). Here, Brooks almost puts plot in the reader (though he also wants to keep it in the narrative).</page><page sequence="8">824 Poetics Today 11 :4 one holding between the lexicon and the syntax of a language system. In the same way that syntax, as a systematic set of rules, governs the order and arrangement of lexical items in language, so story "connects and combines the various entities that make up the world" (ibid.: 27). Malmgren here attributes to the notion of story the type of functions associated with plot structures. It is the systematic set of rules deter- mining the links and the types of interactions among the constitutive parts of a world repertoire. The notion of "unified action" clearly goes back to Aristotle's Poetics, where plot is defined as the source of unity and order for all other components of the narrative: "So the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed. For the thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference is not an organic part of the whole." Such claims indicate that narrative theory in general and narra- tology in particular create a gap between the practical results drawn from narrative models and the ultimate cohering function attributed to the narrative. Furthermore, it seems that narratologists do not con- tent themselves with that abstract object of observation (story, fabula, histoire): the reconstructed sequence of events forming the nucleus of narrative texts; it is rather the all-embracing pattern which, through the principles of organization it reflects, provides the necessary coher- ence to the narrative text in its totality. It is therefore no accident that plot, which often appears as the term covering the latter function, is so central to the definitions of narrative texts, and that it takes prece- dence over other components of the mythos. Without plot, sequences of events, which are also part of our actual world, could not have been transformed into the hermetic and unified structure of a narrative, the world mass could not have been turned into a narrative world: "Plot is the principle of interconnectedness and intention which we cannot do without in moving through the discrete elements-incidents, episodes, actions-of a narrative" (Brooks 1984: 5). This view of plot, as an aesthetic structure that turns a random sequence of events into a significant structure, explains plot's fore- grounded place in narrative theories, and it serves as a convenient point of departure for understanding the rationale of plot models.9 9. "Narrative is not limited to making use of our familiarity with the conceptual network of action. It adds to it discursive features that distinguish it from a simple sequence of action sentences" (Ricoeur 1985: 56). And also, "[plot] is a mediation between the individual events or incidents and a story taken as a whole. In this respect, we may say equivalently that it draws a meaningful story from a diversity of events or incidents . . . or that it transforms the events or incidents into a story" (ibid.: 65).</page><page sequence="9">Ronen * Plot Models 825 The myth of plot unity is an effective and far-reaching presupposition. It motivates the type of problems with which plot models are engaged and also the dynamics delineating the history of narratology. The broad definition of plot and the range of narrative phenomena that narratology attempts to account for in terms of plot characteristics constitute the necessary conditions for understanding the way narra- tology has evolved since the late sixties. I will examine, in what follows, a development in narrative theory described as a move from syntactic to semantic models. To this move corresponds a replacement of action concepts with world (modal) concepts in theorizing about plots. B. Plot Models and Structuralist Ideology Narrative models identify plot with the comprehensive unity of a nar- rative structure, a theoretical conviction which orients narrative theory towards dealing with two problems: one central problem concerns principles of organization unique to narrative; the other has to do with a definition of narrative units. These problems enfold the wide range of questions pertinent to the study of narrative, and they constitute the main criteria for testing the explanatory power of narrative models. Structuralist descriptions of narrative units and structuralist invest- ment in the attempt to isolate a principle which dominates narrative organization both reflect a concern with "narrativity" (i.e., the defini- tion of plot as a principle of overall unity) and hence an interest in the concept of plot which transcends the official object of description of narrative grammars and semiotics. This concern necessarily results in an incompatibility between the practice of structuralism and the ex- plicit antireferential ideology characteristic of this school of thought. This incompatibility will prove to be a sufficient explanation for the shift from syntactic to semantic plot models in narratology. B. 1. Plot models can be classified according to the way in which they delimit the narrative unit and to the level at which narrative units are defined. A narrative unit is expressed through language: "Raskolnikov lifted the axe." Such sentences can be grouped around a generaliz- ing proposition that describes an event forming the surface narrative unit: "Raskolnikov murders the old lady." The move from a linguistic unit to a surface narrative unit should be describable through various procedures of semantic integration. Such an integration could ex- plain how a linguistic sequence is turned into a narrative one. Barthes (1966a), for instance, describes a procedure of naming a sequence. In a further process of abstraction, surface narrative structures are re- placed by a narrative unit, such as "crime" or "murder," abstracted from the semantic content of the narrative text under consideration. This and the next level of description require not just abstraction but also a consideration of distributional relations between an event and</page><page sequence="10">826 Poetics Today 11 :4 its results at a later stage of the narrative sequence. The definition of the narrative unit is grounded on functional considerations which delimit a narrative unit in terms of a deep narrative structure. At this stage, we are already dealing with categories of a universal narrative grammar. Raskolnikov's crime is represented on this level of abstrac- tion, not according to its place in a chronological sequence of events, but according to the function it fulfills in a schematic narrative struc- ture. Categories composing a narrative grammar are variously termed and articulated. In a simplified manner one can say that the nar- rative sequence dealing with the old lady's murder fulfills the func- tion of "complication" or "problem." The difference between the two levels of abstraction is roughly the difference between Propp's para- digmatic functions and story grammars like Pavel's, Bremond's, and others.10 Propp defines the unit of function as "the act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action" (1968: 21), which assumes both the unit's semantic con- tent and its functional relations with other plot constituents. Pavel, on the other hand, employs the categorial vocabulary of Move, Prob- lem, Solution, Auxiliary, Tribulation, etc., which may be understood as abstract categories, covering a great number of concrete situations. The notion of narrative grammar-that narrative units are delim- ited and described according to their function in a deep narrative scheme-implies that events of the narrative are defined as syntac- tic units forwarding the narrative process. The content of a narra- tive unit is nothing but a contingent filling of a functional category. The dragon's kidnapping of the princess can constitute a problem in one story and a solution (for the persecuted grooms) in another. The nonreferential approach has indeed dominated narratological gram- mars, both of the type descending from Propp or Bremond and of the type descending from the abstract semantic categories narrativized by Greimas (1977). The moratorium on referential questions is appar- ent in definitions of narrative units, as it is in attempts to describe narrative-specific principles of organization. Both concepts manifest a similar interest in constructing a logical narrative mechanism free from semantic considerations. 10. A narrative unit can also be represented in an abstract semantic deep structure and not necessarily in a narrative deep structure. According to this structuralist view, initiated in the works of Levi-Strauss and continuing in Greimas's structural semantics, a story is constructed on the basis of an abstract semantic scheme, com- posed of abstract semantic categories of the form \x\ \non-x\, representing relations of opposition and negation. Such a semantic pattern constitutes a deep structure generating narrative structures. See Jefferson (1977) for an exploration of Greimas's case study of Maupassant's narrative "Deux amis."</page><page sequence="11">Ronen * Plot Models 827 Note that "semantic" carries two distinct meanings in this paper: It refers to "bottom-top" models that arrive at categories of narra- tive grammar through the contents of specific units of text (which is the case in Barthes's [1966a] sequence-naming operation, for in- stance). "Semantic" also refers to grammars that make use of abstract semantic categories (a la Fillmore) as their central concepts (as in the case of Greimas, but also in Pavel's move grammar [1985], and in Dolezel's [1976] narrative semantics). Early structuralism claimed to have neutralized semantic considerations in the first sense: "Literature had long enough been regarded as a message without a code for it to become necessary to regard it for a time as a code without a message" (Genette 1982 [1964]: 7). To locate the structuralist orientation in plot models, it might be productive to note that definitions of narrative units may be aligned with one of two possible perspectives on narrative structures. Doleiel (1978) proposes to distinguish between narrative models of a thematic type, an orientation best represented by Tomashevski's (1965) con- cept of the motif, and narrative models with a syntactic orientation, represented by Propp's (1968) concept of a function. Dolezel grounds this theoretical and methodological distinction on the difference be- tween grounding narrative structures on a given text's thematic seg- mentations (through the story motifs) and viewing narrative structure through the prism of a deep level of abstraction in relation to which a story unit's function is decided. Whereas the motif is delimited ac- cording to its position within a concrete narrative sequence (in Crime and Punishment, the hero's penitence is a bound motif), the function is a syntactic category relatively autonomous in relation to a specific unit's semantic content. What characterizes the syntactic approach is both the mapping of concrete semantic units (i.e., murder) by abstract semantic categories (i.e., complication) and the fact that a semantic unit's syntactic value is determined by its overall functional relations with same-level units of action (its effect on the total structure of events). Both orientations face a similar problem regarding the way one moves from narrative surface structures to narrative deep structures, yet it is clear that a syntactic type of model has to account for a sub- stantially different abstraction procedure than does a theme-oriented motif description. One of the most problematic aspects of structuralist studies of narrative is the lack of an account of the formal procedures describing the passage from surface linguistic units to deep-structure units of the narrative langue (see Pavel 1988). Dolezel points here to one of the substantial differences between the formalist concepts of fabula and sjuzet and the narratological concept of a narrative grammar. Whereas the formalist orientation is mainly thematic (in the above sense), the narratological framework, character-</page><page sequence="12">828 Poetics Today 1 :4 ized by a strong antireferentiality and a functionalist approach, treats the narrative text as a sign system whose signified is a narrative abstract grammar. The signified of a narrative text is not described in semantic terms, nor in terms of the world constructed by textual signs, but in terms of a deep narrative structure which maps every new act of nar- rative production. Thus, whereas Tomashevski's thematics operates as a model for describing compositional and combinational procedures in concrete stories, the structuralist trend, at least in its explicit pro- nouncements of purpose, aims toward a definition of the syntactic rules which constitute a narrative grammar, and toward a description of narrative paradigms regardless of specific semantic contents.1 In the work of Propp (1968), for instance, specific units in the folk tales under examination are perceived as variables of constant functions, that is, as contingent contents of an abstract sequence of functions that form the narrative backbone of the entire corpus. The problem of recovery procedures for arriving at syntactic narra- tive units is coupled with the problem of attempting to divorce a unit's syntactic function from its semantic content, both leading to the need for a different type of narrative segmentation. B.2. Plot models differ in the type of principle isolated in order to define plot structure. Since, as claimed above, plot should assign order to the narrative totality, the question of the means through which plot can organize its discrete elements, thereby differentiating the exter- nal world from the world in its narrative-aesthetic guise, becomes of central concern. The question thus formulated does not necessarily appear in structuralist plot models; yet, as I will suggest, attempts to isolate a formal principle of functional organization (defined in terms of causality, chronology, or equivalence) reflect the need to answer this question. In other words, attempts to isolate a singular organizing principle prevalent in the narrative are actually means for explaining how plot turns event-sequences into a structured, closed, and complete whole. Furthermore, I would claim that the attempt to isolate organiz- ing principles specific to narrative reflects the antireferential inclina- tion of structuralist poetics; the totality of a story should be described while disregarding the semantics of a given narrative and its specific world structure. The incompatibility between the attempt to describe the total order of plot and the attempt to reduce this totality to one dominant principle of organization is typical of structuralist descrip- tions of plot structure, and it reflects the gap between action-oriented 11. "[La science de la litterature] ne pourra etre une science des contenus ... mais une science des conditions du contenu, c'est-a-dire des formes: ce qui l'int6ressera, ce seront les variations de sens engendr6es, et, si l'on peut dire, engendrables, par les oeuvres ... son objet ne sera plus les sens pleins de l'oeuvre, mais au contraire le sens vide qui les supporte tous" (Barthes 1966b: 57).</page><page sequence="13">Ronen * Plot Models 829 definitions and story- (narrativity-)oriented definitions of plot, a gap deeply rooted in structuralist poetics from its very beginning. One of the characteristics of structuralist narrative models is the at- tempt to isolate and define the logic of narrative. The question is: What types of relations hold among the narrative's elements and determine the narrative's overall structure? Plot organization is described, within both semantic (Greimassian) models and syntactic models, according to various principles: causality, chronology, and equivalence. These are apparently three qualitatively different principles. Whereas chro- nology is a mimetic organizing principle, causality is a logical principle, and equivalence can be described as a semantic type of organization. Chronology means that a temporal relation exists among events re- constructed from the text since the ordering of events follows a lifelike (and hence extratextual) pattern of temporal order. Causality, on the other hand, means that plot structure reveals a pattern of solidarity among its parts and that plot forms a closed system of interconnect- edness between events.12 I will concentrate on the concept of causality, since in narratological studies time and chronology are often perceived as part of a surface structure and not as immanent to deep narrative schemata.'3 Brooks (1984) and Ricoeur (1985) both draw our attention to the fact that nar- ratological studies miss the dynamics of temporality in plot as part of their ideology. As Ricoeur expresses it, narratological rationality "re- quires for its models of the deep grammar of narrative an achronologi- cal status as a matter of principle, in relation to which the diachrony of transformations, displayed on the surface of a narrative, appears derived and inessential" (1985: 159). The principle of causality, as theoretically formulated, is presumed to be a part of the deep structure of narrative grammar. Follow- ing Aristotle, who compares history to dramatic plot and attributes a precedence to the logic of action over chronology, Barthes (1966a: 8) argues that temporality is not a logical principle and therefore cannot form the ground for a narrative grammar. He claims that the temporal connection between events is no more than a referential illusion. The 12. Functionality and the distributional relations which tie together plot compo- nents and create a plot dynamics seem to me to lead in narratology to a type of determinism where beginning, middle, and end phases of the narrative are per- ceived as equally present and as given. To prove this point, it is enough to examine the way Popper describes the intuitive idea of determinism: "The future co-exists with the past; and the future is fixed, in exactly the same sense as the past. Though the spectator [in motion-picture film] may not know the future, every future event, without exception, might in principle be known with certainty, exactly like the past, since it exists in the same sense in which the past exists" (1982: 5). 13. In classical structuralism, this is true mainly of Greimas, less so of Bremond and Todorov.</page><page sequence="14">830 Poetics Today 1 1 :4 only temporality that exists in a narrative text is not the reality-like temporality but a semiotic time of the narrative system requiring the introduction of elements one after the other. Consequently, Barthes's view requires that chronology be replaced by logic.14 Pavel (1985), whose plot model was proposed twenty years later, pro- vides the formal explanation for rejecting chronology as a principle of plot organization. Pavel shows that deep narrative structures include a level of abstraction at which the order of presenting plot components (events) in the narrative tree differs from the temporal order of their occurrence (ibid.: 33ff.). Pavel concludes that chronology is not part of the deep level of plot but of the surface structure of the narrative. That is to say, chronological links exist only on a surface narrative level, whereas the deep narrative structure is autonomous in relation to the chronological order of events. Such claims motivate the focal position of causal-functional relations in structuralist models; causality is conceived as the immanent principle of narrative structuration.15 Narratological studies of plot make a direct connection between plot structure and causality. The more hermetic the causal connection be- tween events, the more apparent is the way in which plot imposes order on narrative elements. From Forster to Prince, precedence is given to causality as the central principle of narrative structuring. Forster (1927) distinguishes plot from story by differentiating tempo- ral connections from causal ones. Prince (1982), who relates causality to degrees of narrativity, likewise underscores its centrality to plot structure. The principle of causality is of special interest since it re- flects the structuralists' attempt to isolate a logical principle unique to narrative. First, if events of the plot obey a logical causality, it will be possible to understand in what sense a narrative manifests a unified, complete structure, whereas reality is just an accidental aggregate of materials. Second, the connection between problem and solution in the action-structure is a logical one between cause and effect, and this causal pattern can be actualized in endless possibilities and contents. As shown above, the logical connection between cause and effect does not require a chronological contiguity, and it is therefore appropriate for defining a narrative scheme which can be semantically and sequen- tially actualized in endless ways. Causality is welcomed by narratologi- cal models since it is possible to deal in terms of causality with organi- 14. Note, however, that time, as an essential principle of narrative, can be consid- ered part of the deep structure because at the very least a narrative includes one event, one change of state from anterior to posterior. 15. It should, however, be noted that in practice it is rather difficult to discon- nect causality from chronology. Not only does causality imply chronology, but also both principles are present in narratological plot models. Barthes (1966a), for in- stance, after expressing the theoretical ground for distinguishing between the two, proceeds to describe a plot model which makes use of mimetic chronology.</page><page sequence="15">Ronen * Plot Models 831 zations immanent to narrative while disregarding their meaning. The attractiveness of causality also derives from its being, in principle, an objective kind of relation which does not depend on interpretation or on the subjective reconstructions of one reader or another. Such a logical principle can also explain various aspects of plot structure: it can explain turning points in the plot, the centrality of events to nar- rative structures, and why a plot has a beginning, middle, and end. In other words, the functionalist orientation in structuralist poetics substantially depends on the prevalence of causal links between the story's events. Is causality indeed a consistent, unique, and objective principle of organizing events in a narrative text? Causality implies a link between the glass's falling off the table and its being broken. The two events are causally linked (although the latter is not a necessary effect of the cause: the glass can fall without being broken). Yet it is sufficient to examine any plot to see that causality, as a principle for organizing the narrative, includes causal relations of various kinds: causal relations proper to which are added functional relations among aims, prob- lems, and results decided retrospectively on the grounds of a narrative understanding. Causality in the strict sense rarely explains the move from one event of the plot to the next. The eclectic type of arrangement implied in the principle of cau- sality can be illustrated by the case of Oedipus Rex. The following events are all part of the Oedipus story (not all, though, are in the drama): 1. Predictions about Oedipus's fate. 2. Oedipus is expelled and then is adopted by the king of Corinth. 3. Upon discovering the prophecies, Oedipus runs away from the palace of his adoptive parents. 4. Oedipus kills a nobleman on the road. 5. Oedipus solves the Sphinx's riddle. 6. Oedipus is crowned and marries Jocasta. 7. The plague. 8. Revelation of the truth about Oedipus's identity. 9. Revelation of the truth about the identity of Laius's murderer. Structuralist attempts to account for plot structure, to isolate a syn- tactic narrative principle of organization, raise many problems. The plot of Oedipus Rex includes various types of links which are causal in different senses. Some events stand in relations of psychological motivation (hearing the Sphinx's prophecy motivates Oedipus's escape from Corinth), some are based on direct causality (6 causes 7), some just (remotely) enable other events (5 enables 6; 4 enables 6),16 and 16. See Shen (forthcoming) for an analysis of types of causality and the logical relations each type entails.</page><page sequence="16">832 Poetics Today 1 :4 some causal links depend on conventional assumptions. Moreover, since we deal here with a case where the entire sequence unfolds within a deterministic teleology (the gods will all events and so are the final cause of all effects), specific events, like the marriage of Oedipus to Jocasta, cause the plague only according to the thematic rationaliza- tion characteristic of the drama, where such a sin brings about the gods' rage. The remote dependence of the plague on the marriage between mother and son can be demonstrated by the fact that these are events brought about by two different agents. The plague, which is the gods' doing, is an outcome of Oedipus's sin only in a world where it is conventionally assumed that divine and human deeds are correlated. Yet, likewise, events linked by direct causality in nondeter- ministic worlds always assume a conventionally based causality (cancer is an effect of tobacco use only in a world where smokers convention- ally assume a causal relation between the two; with no such convention, cancer cannot be said to be caused by tobacco use). In accounting for the relations among events, and for the interaction between action domains of different agents, a strict logical principle of causality is evidently insufficient. Causality turns out to provide a problematic explanation for the plot structure of this narrative. While the structuralist "syntactic" method- ology strives to isolate and abstract the narrative langue and the logic of the narrative system, the structure of events does not seem to follow a strict causal principle; events are subjected to an action-structure in which the constituent parts are functionally linked, which means that causal links originate from a prior integration or from a narra- tive understanding. Narratology's attempt to elucidate the concept of plot in terms of a logical principle of organization (causality) should be seen, partly, as reflecting a presupposed characteristic of all plot models: the presupposition that plot is a central and dominant struc- turing principle of narrative texts. By tracing the way structuralist plot models transgress the theoretical principles they set for themselves, it is possible both to follow the move from traditional narratology to what is commonly termed "narrative semantics" and to explain from whence the fallacies of the narratological conceptions of plot emerge. Plot models attempt to isolate the principles ordering narrative texts (causal chronology or psychological causality linking events, spatial relations between descriptive components, oppositional relations be- tween characters, etc.) when, as it turns out, plot structure is no more than an eclectic set of ordering rules, which only together, and from a functional perspective, can explain plot dynamics and the relations among components of the narrative. In the foregoing discussion, various difficulties emerging from the suppositions and practice of classical narratology have been enumer-</page><page sequence="17">Ronen * Plot Models 833 ated: (1) that segmentation into narrative units cannot but combine thematic (bottom-top) and syntactic (top-bottom) procedures; (2) that narrative organization cannot be based solely on logical relations of functional causality. Narrative structure derives from an aggregate of possible semantic relations (equivalence, chronology, causality, moti- vation, etc.). Structuralist models have been concerned with constructing a nar- rative logic, within a syntactic model and in view of an antireferential ideology, which has led to an impasse since causality and functionality presuppose a prior semantic integration. It is in response to structural- ism that more recent narrative theories propose to replace the above with a comprehensive model of narrative semantics. C. Narrative Semantics: From Syntactic to Semantic Plot Models In view of various difficulties posed by structuralist plot models, at- tempts have been made to situate narrative logic elsewhere, to re- late the logic of narrative to a more general grammar of texts where semantic notions (e.g., coherence, semantic axioms and maxims active in fiction, modalities, etc.) are conceived of as "the base, formative component" (Dole2el 1976: 129). Indeed, one of the main claims against structuralist poetics was that its descriptions of narrative lan- guage could not account for the semiological specificity of narrative texts, that its definitions of narrative units were arbitrary, that its prin- ciples of narrative organization were definable only in view of a spe- cific text's meaning-structure, etc. The connection between narrative events is almost never a priori causal. Structuralist studies of narrative structures, being basically teleological and functional, cannot isolate an autonomous logic of narrative which is describable outside of a spe- cific plot. As Peter Brooks claims, in justifying the association he makes between the Freudian psychoanalytic concept of desire for death and the narrative notion of an ending, "The narrative must tend toward its end, seek illumination in its own death. Yet this must be the right death, the correct end" (1984: 103). An ending is not autonomously correct outside the meaning-structure of a specific life, of a specific narrative. The antireferential ideology that explains the persistent attempt to talk about a syntactic logic of narrative dominated structuralist thought for some time, until it started to give way to what Pavel de- scribes as a "reconsideration of the moratorium on referential issues" (1986: 10). The structuralist program, from its initial formulations (in the works of Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Greimas, and Todorov) to its later manifestations (in the narratology of Prince, Bal, Rimmon-Kenan, and others), situates at the center of its project paradigmatic structures of a narrative syntax or of a narrative langue. Ideologically, the pre-</page><page sequence="18">834 Poetics Today 1 :4 occupation with narrative paradigms excludes any dealings with the level of meaning and with specific semantic organizations. No won- der that one of the main arguments against structuralism pointed to the fact that, in view of the notion of empty forms, structuralist poetics was not really capable of addressing the semiology of narrative texts and, therefore, that its concentration on the abstract level of common narrative structures was doomed to failure. The shift from the structuralist belief in a narrative logic to a nar- rative semantics is a natural outcome of the difficulties and dead ends encountered by classical narratology. As mentioned above, conceptual and procedural problems emerging from classical structuralism cre- ated the need for alternative, or rather rectified, models that would incorporate what was learned from the earlier phase of structuralism. In the last section of this paper, I will particularly concentrate on that branch of narrative semantics which emphasizes narrative modalities and world structure and on its relevance to some of the queries clas- sical structuralism has left unresolved (as demonstrated in the works of Eco, Pavel, Doleiel, van Dijk, Ryan, Prince, and others). In this sec- tion, however, I will briefly demonstrate signs of a growing awareness that a text semantics should be the basis for any text grammar and that, in the case of narrative, abstract narrative structures should be tied to semantic constructions. This theoretical orientation is illumi- nating in the account it provides of the semantics inherent to narrative grammars, in this way carrying the structuralist project toward more fruitful directions. It is already evident in Barthes's early work (1966a) that the con- tents of story-units are taken into account in constructing models of narrative structures. The procedures for moving from units of text to narrative categories and functions are implemented through pro- cesses of semantic integration, as reflected in the titles or headings given to narrative sequences. The need for relating narrative gram- mar to a semantic domain is already apparent in early structuralist plot models, and it has become more pronounced in later develop- ments in narrative theory where a semantics of narrative is assigned various places of prominence. Culler (1980), for instance, expresses some profound doubts about the possibility of reconstructing a logic of narrative, and he can hence serve as a handy example in tracking down these developments. Culler investigates the concepts of fabula and sjuzet with a skepticism which undermines any attempt to divorce narrative syntax from semantics. He argues that fabula and sjuzet do not represent a certain logic of plot organization (organization by the chronology of narrated events, as opposed to a chronologically de- viant organization); rather, they represent a thematic order applied to a given text. The fabula is not a pattern of story materials abstracted</page><page sequence="19">Ronen * Plot Models 835 from modes of narration but a structure which derives from narra- tive modes of signification. Hence, the relations between fabula and sjuzet in Oedipus Rex are not the outcome of chronological deforma- tion (e.g., Laius's murder by his son is recounted at the end of the narrative chain but belongs to the initial moves of the fabula). Culler suggests considering the place of the event in the sjuzet as indicative of its function; it is the outcome of the narrative meaning-structure, an outcome necessitated by everything which precedes it. Laius's death is not caused by circumstances or fatal prophecies but by the demands of a plot structure to which Laius's murder by Oedipus is indispensable. In Culler's view every narrative is articulated in terms of a dual logic: the logic of chronology and causality and the logic of signification (the order of events in the fabula of Oedipus Rex corresponds to a thematic structure of truth revelation and exposure to one's true identity). Although Culler's proposal here constitutes more of a provocation than it propounds alternative formal procedures for activating a nar- rative semantics, he does raise an important doubt regarding narra- tology's ability to explain plot dynamics in terms of a narrative gram- mar. Note also that Culler points here to the need to make room for text semantics within the narratological paradigm itself.'7 D. Plot as a Constellation of Possible Worlds The orientation of narrative is a substantial problem which many plot models succeed in evading. Most plot models describe the structure of the narrative as a given. This is possible because the functional principle immanent to structuralism dictates that plot and plot dynam- ics are always viewed retrospectively. Both syntactic and thematic- semantic models express the view that only the narrative ending can determine plot structure: "By simply retelling the story we immedi- ately discover what may be omitted without destroying the coherence of the narrative and what may not be omitted without disturbing the connection among events" (Tomashevski 1965: 68). Such plot models often acknowledge the functional dependence of the narrative struc- ture on its ending: "Many narratives can be viewed as teleologically determined. . . . Narrative often displays itself in terms of an end which functions as its (partial) condition, its magnetizing force, its organizing principle" (Prince 1982: 157). For the very reason that plot 17. Culler, to be more specific, shows that the plot structure obeys both a syntactic type of logic and a semantic logic. Beginning, middle, and end are therefore not just units in a causal chain but also functions in a structure of signification. The identity of Laius's murderer not only constitutes the last unit in a causal chain, but it also opens up the complication around which the plot is structured. Events re- corded as deviant, in terms of natural chronology, can be regarded as thematically essential and natural.</page><page sequence="20">836 Poetics Today 11 :4 is viewed from a functional-retrospective point, such plot models will tend to describe narrative structure on the basis of factually presented events.18 Possibilities which remain unactualized are divorced from plot structures. One of the claims against such views has to do with their inability to account for plot orientation and direction. It was this very problem which Bremond addressed in his writings, describing plot structure as a mechanism of choices among alternative narrative sequences. Every point in a narrative chain opens up alternative options for actualiza- tion. Likewise, Barthes refers to cardinal functions in plot as being "the risky moments of a narrative" (1966a: 95). Note that modal categories have also entered classical structuralism, yet have clearly remained at the fringes of narrative models. One can refer in this context to Todorov's grammar (1977), where mood (the relation which a char- acter sustains with a narrative proposition) is among the secondary categories of the grammar. The same is true of Greimas's grammar (1977), where modal utterances form one class in the typology of nar- rative utterances, a class determined by the specific semantic restric- tions imposed by modal classemes (e.g., "savoir"). The presence of modal categories even in early structuralist models points, however, to the link between these early models and models of narrative semantics that officially place the play among alternative actualizations at their center. Within narrative semantics, Eco (1979) describes plot structure as a process of activating some semantic possibilities while narcotizing others. The fabula is eventually structured as a process of choosing among alternative courses or possibilities of actualization, and the nar- rative structure is the outcome of this process. The options opened up by the text, the fact that the narrative is a structure of diverging alternatives, are reflected in the reader's active participation, which includes inferences, forward anticipations, gap-filling, etc. Plot models describing plot structure as a process of selection among alternative courses of events and states show how the narrative cre- ates its structure through linear dynamics, yet they too cannot explain the orientation of a narrative because of their forward-oriented per- spective, and because they lack modal concepts which could account for narrative change. In a Bremondian approach the narrativity of narrative is dependent on the particular course selected to be actual- ized, whereas in more or less teleological approaches the narrativity of narratives depends on a satisfying ending. 18. "If narrativity is a function of the discreteness and specificity of the (sequences of) events presented, it is also a function of the extent to which their occurrence is given as a fact (in a certain world) rather than a possibility or probability. The hallmark of narrative is assurance" (Prince 1982: 149).</page><page sequence="21">Ronen * Plot Models 837 Plot dynamics can be approached retrospectively or linearly. The ar- ticulation of modally oriented plot models in recent years derives from some of the narratological conceptions of narrative structure. In what follows, I will briefly present the solutions proposed by models of plot within the framework of a possible-worlds semantics, in a natural con- tinuation to structuralist models of plot. It is a system which answers some of the substantial objections to structuralist studies of plot. The theory of possible worlds as developed in modal logic reflects an attempt to assign concrete ontological content to modal concepts. Possible-worlds theory has produced several metaphors which have proven to be useful working hypotheses for the study of narrative. The metaphor of possibility adopted by narrative semiotics refers to procedures of actualization and inference which concern individuals and properties belonging to different possible worlds imagined by the reader as possible outcomes of the fabula (see Eco 1979: 217ff.). The other metaphor related to possible worlds, and which bears on de- velopments in modes of theorizing about plots, emerges from the idea of a plurality of worlds. The idea here is that possible worlds enable us to describe the universe not as a single, determinate, and determined set of facts but as a constellation of possible and impossible situations. Along the same line is the proposal to describe narrative texts (and narrative worlds) as composed of a constellation of states of affairs that are modally different. The plurality of worlds enables us to de- scribe the inner semantic structure of a fictional narrative in terms of a modal system: "Le texte narratif se repr6sente comme un ensemble ordonne de CP-mondes [un 'monde textualise' qui 6tablit la relation entre les systemes modaux de la logique et le texte narratif]" (Vaina 1977: 4). The idea that a narrative text is composed of a constellation of possible worlds, that each narrative situation is modally indexed, and that a selective actualization of narrative possibilities produces an action-structure has opened up a new direction in narrative theory. One of the forerunners in the study of plot within the conceptual system of possible worlds is Vaina (1977), who describes the possible worlds of the narrative text from the strict perspective of a logician- semantician and who, in this respect, stays very close to concepts of logical semantics and modality. Since an orientation toward logic is prevalent in linguistic semantics, narrative semantics can also benefit by orienting itself in a similar direction. Once the text has been seg- mented into its worlds (each world or subworld consists of a set of truth-valued propositions that form a state of affairs), one can con- tinue identifying the entities that compose the textual world. The properties of these entities are then specified (that is, an inventory of individuals and properties is elaborated), and the relations between individuals' properties are established. At the next stage changes of state are described, and the concept of event is introduced into the</page><page sequence="22">838 Poetics Today 11:4 model through the notion of a change of state. The history of the tex- tual world is composed of transitions from one total state of the world to another. The logic of change and action is therefore a derivative of the logic of state as a set of propositions. We can easily see how action vocabulary is directly connected and even derived from the vocabulary of semantic logic. The last part of the model aims to describe not just the structure of change but the structure of the fabula. For that purpose modal concepts are employed: It seems reasonable to us to pose the problem of the attitude of individu- als vis-a-vis a sequence of events in which they participate, or even vis- a-vis certain "states of affairs" determining the choice of a future action. One operates on this level with a (modal) logic of propositional attitudes. (Ibid.: 7) Propositional attitudes (e.g., recall, dream, perceive, hope, desire, be- lieve, know, ignore, etc.) divide the possible worlds of the text into those compatible with the particular attitude of an individual and those incompatible with it. This basic model proposed by Vaina was later succeeded by modi- fied versions which created a more articulated integration of nar- ratological concepts with the semantic concepts emerging from the possible-worlds framework. Paradigmatic examples are Pavel (1980) and Ryan (1985). Ryan appropriates Pavel's main supposition that "a plot is split into more than one narrative domain, and is accord- ingly divided into several distinct sets of propositions. The nature of these propositions is heterogeneous. A domain contains ontologi- cal, epistemological, axiological and action propositions" (Pavel 1980: 106). Ryan indeed starts with the supposition that narrative worlds are modally stratified, thus adding a dimension to the basic seman- tic model of narrative logic proposed by Vaina. According to her claim, "the worlds of the modal system of narration fall into two main categories: (1) those with an absolute or autonomous existence; and (2) those whose existence is relative to somebody, i.e., which exist through a mental act of a character" (Ryan 1985: 720). In other words, the analogy between the inner structure of a narrative world and the inner structure of the universe is grounded on the fundamental dis- tinction between factual and modalized propositions. The narrative universe has an actual world of its own, free of specific propositional attitudes: the domain regarded as actual and real by the characters of the narrative universe. Other domains of the narrative universe are subjected to propositional attitudes and are therefore relative to the world-representing acts of individuals, their beliefs and wishes, predictions and inventions. Modal differentiations added to narrative logic produce a hierarchi-</page><page sequence="23">Ronen * Plot Models 839 cal dimension which privileges one domain of events and states as the factual domain of the narrative universe; the other domains are viewed as relative worlds of the narrative universe (epistemic or knowledge worlds, hypothetical worlds, intention worlds, wish worlds, worlds of moral values, obligation worlds, and alternate universes). Ryan adds a dynamic dimension to the modal conception of world structure by integrating it with narrative concepts of plot construction. The rela- tions built up between worlds can result in productive conflicts when the individual experiencing the conflict "is in a position, and is willing to take steps toward its resolution" (ibid.: 733). Note that the metaphor of "possible worlds" not only allows for an account of semantic prin- ciples that modally structure the narrative universe, but also serves as a conceptual instrument for describing the structure of plot and its movement.19 The description of a fictional world as a constellation of possible worlds (including a factual domain) is combined with a narrative logic.20 The advantages of such a model for describing the narrative structure of plot over more traditional narrative semantics are significant. (1) The semantic procedures for describing narrative worlds and their interrelations are at the same time paradigmatic rules describ- ing the components and logic of the narrative system and operational rules for describing plot movement. In this respect, the description of plot as a modal structure overcomes the theoretical discrepancy, so typical of structuralist poetics, between paradigmatic rules and syn- tagmatic operations. (2) The emergence of a narrative semantics from modal conceptu- alizations produces plot models which elude one of the most serious problems in structuralist studies of plot. It was shown above how struc- turalism concerned itself with definitions of narrative units, which raised numerous problems of methodology and practice. Within the conceptual framework of modal semantics, the narrative unit is per- ceived as a relational situation holding between a set of possible worlds. Such a semantics of narrative generates a segmentation which has the following advantages: (a) the narrative "unit" takes into account, at the same time, the over- all narrative structure and its linear build up; that is, a given narrative situation necessarily reflects its position in the total plot structure, and 19. Note that in all these models, from Vaina's to Pavel's, one can detect a slide from narrative to fiction. The narrativity of worlds is tackled through modal con- cepts of actuality and possibility, concepts which were primarily adopted by literary theory to account for the fictionality of worlds. 20. "Le recit ne comporte pas qu-un seul etat d'affaires mais plut6t une succession de mondes inscrite dans une temporalite representee par la structure narrative elle-mbme" (Chateau 1976: 214).</page><page sequence="24">840 Poetics Today 1 1:4 it incorporates situations which constitute alternative options for plot development; (b) the dynamics of plot and the concept of change are inherent to the delineation of any narrative situation; (c) a narrative state of affairs contains syntactic and semantic infor- mation which derives from a general logic of narrative, but it also dem- onstrates the particular laws established by a given narrative world; thus, in a psychological novel the relations among events mostly de- pend on mental causality and motivation (types of causation are only classifiable within a general semantics of narrative); the specific type of mental motivation dominating the narrative has to do with the con- crete semantic rules operative in a given text. In addition to those axioms that every narrative postulates, there are ramifying variants that are world-specific. (3) The relations implied in such concepts as state of affairs, pro- ductive conflicts, and constellations of possible worlds are such that they enable narrative semantics to exit the boundaries of the actual. Eco (1979) has shown the need for describing all the shared factors and knowledge frames involved in the semiotic process of narrative understanding. He has insisted that narrative structure cannot be ac- counted for unless the totality of knowledge a narrative text activates is taken into consideration. It is apparent that within such a concep- tual framework it is possible to describe the way in which the narrative text incorporates elements that are not connected or not subordinated to the event-sequence (descriptions, non-narrative propositions, non- actualized events). Plot structure includes both factual domains and nonactual domains of a narrative or non-narrative nature. (4) The concept of productive conflict is both comprehensive (a con- flict can be activated by any principle of narrative organization) and takes into account the specific semantic and syntactic laws operative in a given narrative world. For this very reason, describing the dynam- ics of plot in terms of productive conflicts certainly provides a more fruitful mode for describing the logic of plot advancement. In this paper changes in narratological studies, from classical struc- turalism to current semantics of possible worlds, have been described as stages located along one continuous line of theorizing about plot structures. These stages indicate a paradigm shift in narratology where some of the suppositions made by classical structuralism have been replaced. This paradigm shift has been described on three comple- mentary levels: (1) syntactic functionalism has been replaced by a narrative semantics; (2) attempts to describe a logic of narrative by isolating a unique principle of organization have been replaced by a more dynamic and eclectic view of narrative organization; (3) the anti-</page><page sequence="25">Ronen * Plot Models 841 referential conception of narrative has been replaced by a renewed interest in the referent and in the structure of the narrative universe.
