<plain_text><page sequence="1">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW which might be less obvious, be reconciled with the Michigan model of the social psychology of voting, which would see mature party systems as more likely to foster the strong party attachments needed for political stability. A weakness in the study, especially since so much stress is put on explaining the impact of the class cleavage on volatility, is the failure to establish an independent measure of socio-economic class. While there is much to be said for constructing a measure that taps changes in support for the political parties on the Left, it is clearly not valid to see this as a direct reflection of the strength of the socio-economic class cleavage. Ola Listhaug Department of Sociology, University of Trondheim, Norway and Department of Political Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Stephen Horigan: Nature and Culture in Western Discourses. London: Routledge. 1988. 129pp. Stephen Horigan argues that the human sciences (e.g. anthropology, sociology) have inherited from the Enlightenment two metaphysically-based assumptions concerning the relationship between Homo sapiens and the rest of nature. The first is a conception of humans as being qualitatively differentiated from and superior to animals. The second concerns the belief that culture is superordinate to nature. These oppositions legitimate the human sciences as autonomous disciplines by providing their subject matter, namely, culture. Practitioners within the human sciences have defended the autonomy of culture by declaring it, unquestionably, a uniquely human phenomenon. Culture depends, allegedly, upon humans' ability to impose a superorganic reality upon their empirical worlds by using symbols, most notably, language. In other words, 'culture defines the human and language becomes the sign, par excellence, of culture' (p. 4). Horigan examines how the aforementioned distinctions are developed in the works of A. L. Kroeber, Leslie White, and Marshall Sahlins-all influential figures in the development of North American anthropology. Each was influenced, at least to some degree, by Franz Boas. When Boas entered anthropology in the early 1880s, the discipline was dominated by a perspective termed 'evolutionary naturalism'. It rested upon two fundamental tenets: (1) all human cultures develop in a uniform pattern according to the same evolutionary principles and (2) culture is determined by the same laws of nature as is material life. Cultural development is therefore a natural process that can be explained in terms of the same biological principles used to account for other natural phenomena. Boas rejected these propositions and their seeming implication that anthropology be seen as a branch of biology. He argued instead that the development of specific cultures depends upon the particular historical and social experiences of the societies. There is no uniform pattern of cultural evolution. Culture must be therefore studied 'in its own terms', free from any influence of 'natural biological processes'. The modern concept of culture first becomes explicit in the work of A. L. Kroeber, who was one of Boas' students. Writing around 1917, Kroeber defined culture as a 'self-enclosed and unified realm of phenomena, a distinct level, or order, of society rigidly differentiated from biological or psychological phenomena' (p. 18). It can therefore be explained only in terms of itself. This manner of viewing culture gained wide acceptance in both anthropology and sociology. For Kroeber, the opposition between nature and culture rested upon a qualitative separation of humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. This latter distinction inheres in the alleged fact that only humans possess culture. Kroeber, thus, engaged in circular reasoning. His claim that only humans possess culture was grounded in the assumption that only humans have the ability to construct and use languages. Moreover, language is divorced from a person's biological makeup. It is 'external to the individual'. Leslie White and Marshall Sahlins developed the closely related proposition that culture is a realm of signification, dependent upon the ability to construct and use symbols. White argued that this ability is unique to humans and is a prerequisite for cultural development. Animals, including other primates, lack the intelligence to create and use symbols. They live only in the present and are unable to transfer socially acquired information across generations. Sahlins criticized those scholars who explained culture in terms of people's efforts to satisfy basic biological needs or personal interests. He argued that humans are unique in their ability to live according 101</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS to symbolic schemes of their own creation. Culture must therefore be explained in terms the logic of these symbolic systems of meaning. The opposition between humans and animals and between nature and culture is also found in the writings of Claude Levi-Strauss. He argued that the human brain classifies and categorizes experiences according to a set of binary oppositions. The distinction between nature and culture is but one example. Nature is characterized by its universality. Culture features the existence of rules, and only humans have the ability to make rules. Levi-Strauss argued that universal incest prohibitions are neither natural, cultural, nor a combination of the two. Rather, the prohibition of incest constitutes the fundamental step through which the transition from nature to culture is accomplished. 'By prohibiting possible natural sexual relationships, the taboo on incest constitutes the founding of culture. It is a necessary condition for society, the condition that allows for the very possibility of culture' (p. 44). Moreover, culture is unique to humans because they are the only species that has the capacity for language. Along with the existence of rule governed behavior, it is language that defines culture. These anthropologists require that qualitative oppositions be maintained between nature and culture and between humans and other species. The former distinction is always bound up, at least to some degree, in the latter. Horigan argues that there are conceptual problems associated with using such oppositions. Most notably, 'the distinction between nature and culture is evoked as the means by which culture is constituted as a legitimate field of study. But the distinction itself is not the product of enquiry; it is, rather, the condition of enquiry' (p. 6-emphasis provided). In other words, if it's not cultural, it isn't considered to be a legitimate area of intellectual concern for social scientists. And, that which is cultural is, by definition, that which separates humans from animals. Since this distinction is not based upon empirical findings, it 'functions as the means whereby a certain metaphysical argument is smuggled in. So the object of the investigation of the human sciences is still itself caught up in a certain metaphysics' (p. 6). Horigan traces the metaphysics of the distinction by providing a lively chronological account of the manner in which the themes of 'primitivism', 'wildness', and 'feral children' have been treated in Western discourses. Boundaries differentiating human (i.e. cultural) and animal (i.e. natural) phenomena have always been problematic, but the lines of demarcation gain scientific importance in the eighteenth century with the rise of classification schemes and natural history. The human sciences are born, and the terms of the opposition come to define their legitimate subject matter. 'Here the qualities and attributes specific to 'man' become the object of empirical dispute, and 'policing' of the boundary between nature and culture becomes a decisive issue for the human sciences . . .' (p. 7). Attempts to teach chimpanzees a human language are allegedly the most recent efforts to scientifically differentiate humans from other animals. After presenting the findings to some of the better-known studies, Horigan argues that the experiments themselves and the debates that they generate continue to use humanity as the yardstick against which the rest of the animal kingdom is measured. Humanity is still seen as the pinnacle of biological evolution. This anthropomorphic assumption is contrasted with modern Darwinian theory. The latter recognizes that traits characterizing the various species, including humans, are adaptations to their habitual environments. It makes little sense, from an evolutionary calculus, to claim that one species is inherently superior to the rest. The question of whether chimpanzees can learn a human language is essentially a misguided one that obscures the real value of such experiments, namely, what they can teach us about primate intelligence and communication skills. In the concluding chapter, Horigan evaluates the empirical validity of the various criteria that have been used uncritically to draw qualitative distinctions between humans and other animals. The first of these criteria center around two closely related propositions: (1) only humans can learn a language and (2) language is totally divorced from biology. Focusing upon the 'only humans can' argument, Horigan notes the circular reasoning involved when language is defined as a uniquely human phenomenon. In evaluating the second proposition, he presents some of Noam Chomsky's work demonstrating that all known human languages possess the same 'deep structure'. These findings strongly suggest that our ability to produce and learn languages, though their specific content varies cross- culturally, is itself a product of the complex bio- programming of the human brain. 'Critical periods' of learning also appear to exist, after which language acquisition becomes especially difficult. These periods of fertile learning are analogous to those found in other species, most notably, white-crowned sparrows. The evidence suggests, then, that language is not 'external to the individual'; it is soundly rooted in our biology. 102</page><page sequence="3">EUROPEAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW The ability to make and use tools has long been considered a trait that differentiates humans from other animals. Horigan dispels this myth by presenting some of Jane Goodall's observations of tool construction and use among the chimpanzees inhabiting the Gombe Stream Reserve. Among other things, the animals were observed to strip the leaves off selected twigs and insert the bare twigs carefully into termite nests. Creating and using these simple tools enabled the chimps to catch and eat more termites than they could by using their fingers alone. Adults taught the technique to their youngsters, thereby transmitting it intergenerationally. The belief that only humans possess 'self- awareness' has been a cornerstone of much sociological theorizing. This assumption was called into question in the mid 1970s. Psychologist Gordon Gallup devised a series of experiments demonstrating that, over time, chimpanzees and orangutans came to recognize their own images in mirrors. Horigan presents the details of one experiment in which Gallup used red, odorless dye to paint spots on the foreheads of anaesthetized animals who had previously been exposed to mirrors. When the awakened animals were reintroduced to the mirrors, they began immediately to rub the red spots. Gallup reasoned that this behavior made little sense if they perceived the mirror images to be other animals. They had apparently developed a rudimentary sense of self-awareness. Finally, Horigan addresses the common mis- conception that only human behavior is learned. The behavior of other animals is allegedly 'instinctive' and requires no learning. Ethologists have known for a long time now that learning is critical to the development of behavior in other social species. An interesting example of learned innovative behavior was observed by researchers who were studying foraging patterns of Japanese macaques. The observers buried potatoes in and scattered rice upon a sandy beach that the animals Trequented. They were surprised when Imo, a female, used sand and water to scrub dirt from the potatoes that she was preparing to eat. Moreover, instead of laboriously separating each grain of rice from the sand, she tossed handfuls of both into the ocean. The sand sank, but the rice floated. Imo then scooped the rice off the water's surface. Other troop members began to imitate her innovative behavior, and within several months, washing and scooping were common occurrences. The significance of Horigan's book lies in its critical examination of the basic assumptions upon which the human sciences rest. His overall conclusion is that arguments 'for human uniqueness and the autonomy of culture are becoming increasingly difficult to maintain as our knowledge of other animal species [especially the higher primates] increases' (p. 109). There is an implict message in the book: If the human sciences are to continue to enjoy legitimacy within the scientific community, it is essential that their practitioners reevaluate these assumptions in light of two growing bodies of literature: (1) behavioral studies of other social species, especially the higher primates and (2) studies strongly suggesting a genetic component to human behavior. There is an irony in the behavior of those social scientists who are the most adamant in staking out and defending their 'intellectual territory'. Their efforts are analogous, if not altogether homologous, to the territorial behavior observed in other species. If there is a qualitative difference, and there may be, it apparently involves the fact that humans are capable of creating various kinds of territories, including symbolic ones. But staking out and defending one's 'turf' is a class of behavior that we share with much of the animal kingdom. I have only reservation concerning this otherwise insightful and timely book. Horigan takes several unnecessary 'jabs' at sociobiology (pp. 105, 109-11). The attacks are unwarranted and demonstrate a lack of knowledge concerning some very complex issues that are currently subject to considerable debate. I do not criticize Horigan for his lack of knowledge, but it is best to avoid making general statements out of ignorance, especially when the claims are erroneous. This minor objection notwithstanding, I would highly recommend Nature and Culture in Western Discourses to sociologists and other social scientists who are concerned about the future of their disciplines.
