<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 569 poststructuralist hero to do. Again, Berger is quite clear about what his Rembrandt is up to: Rembrandt's paintings "perform a cri- tique, a sometimes bumptious and hilarious parody" (p. 11), of what we might call today the painterly Establishment but what Berger refers to, more precisely, as the "scopic re- gime of mimetic idealism" (p. 77). By this latter phrase he means that system of flattery and idealization, embodied in the pose, that characterizes portrait painting as a represen- tational technology and a class strategy in the early modern period. Under a rubric of truth to nature and homage to the ideal type, paint- ers connived with their patrons to produce on canvas what God or the feudal lord had failed to achieve in real life. "Mimetic idealism," then, is really one of the great red herrings of art history. It natu- ralizes the pose by erasing its contrived char- acter. It replaces class-mediated gestures with universalistic rhetorics: the "eye as a window to the soul," the "inner self' as hidden and private. These truisms surround the act of portraiture with an ideology of exposure, as if the goal of the painter were to reveal on canvas what the sitter, by himself or herself, could or would not admit. The result is not only-and perhaps curiously-to shift the at- tention away from the sitter to the painter, whose techniques now hold the key to char- acter and its perception, and whose style now stands as a sign of insight and truth, but also to beget a form of art history that inadver- tently buys into portraiture's own game. The art historian, like the painter, engages in a characterological game of hide-and-seek (are those hints of kindness or arrogance or cru- elty that we see there, in the sitter's stare?). In the process, the critic forgets or-worse- buries the constructed and historically con- tingent nature of the pose. To draw attention, then, to the fictiveness of the pose is really a way of recovering history. Berger's goal is not to dabble in theory for its own sake but to demythologize history, to dig archaeologi- cally beneath the rhetorics of character and inner life in order to find the historical pres- sures that produced them as rhetorics. Berger's ambition, then, is not to remythologize Rem- brandt but to reinterpret him as a master of historical conventions. But, to put the matter baldly, Rembrandt's oppositional stance, his willful desire to decon- struct the "scopic regime" that surrounds and defines him, invokes a type of countercultural narrative that progressive scholarship has been producing for a long time now. Berger's Rembrandt, almost against his (Berger's) will, resembles nothing so much as the hero (or antihero) that critics from the 1960s forward have most liked to admire. He is the Hero as Demythologizer, if not a truth teller, then a convention smasher. And-truth be told-it is this very tension in Berger's book that I most admire. Like most critics of the past twenty years, Berger is sensitive to the sins of the centered self. He reaches with extraordi- nary success toward a form of historical anal- ysis defined by structures, regimes, dis- courses. He understands the power of representation not as a "reflection" of cul- ture, a fortunate but adventitious overlay to the realms of political economy, but as the central player in the shaping of the modern world. That is what it means to define the interior life as an "effect of representation," a marker of bourgeois class identity, rather than as an essential and ahistorical fact. Despite his attentiveness to the Intentional Fallacy, Berger most wonderfully and richly falls victim to it. He winds up creating a Rem- brandt who, even if only an "effect," and even if only in his works, charms and delights us with his wisdom, his agency, and, of course, his folly. Berger reproduces, in other words, the sin that most distresses him about Nor- bert Elias. In the name of discourse and rep- resentation, he produces an individual of ec- centric and outsize proportions. Perhaps this is because, deep down, Berger is himself a diehard, post-1960s cultural critic. Or per- haps this is because any study of culture, when mediated through the language of art history and the career of an individual artist, will necessarily drag along with it the dis- courses of self and identity. What it suggests to me, at least, is that Fictions of the Pose is really a wonderful salvo from within the Culture Wars. Berger has taken his stand with the discourse folk, the people who brought us the death of the author and the birth of the asylum. He reads early modern painters through the lens of postmodern theory, and he does so not because he assents to "pres- entism" or believes all history to be a narcis- sistic and self-referencing enterprise, but be- cause he takes seriously the "modernity" of early modern studies. For Berger, the Renais- sance and post-Renaissance worlds are inter- esting less for their alterity, their difference from us today, than for the remarkable gene- alogy they provide us, the way they beget the world we incorrectly believe ourselves to have invented on our own. And yet-despite his refusal to traffic in the remnants of human- ism, his unhappiness with unseemly dollops of individual "agency" and "will"-Berger has managed to reinvent if not the author proper, then the Painter, not only as an effect of representation but also as a manipulator of it. He has given us a series of incisive inter- pretations of individual paintings, an intellec- tual and cultural history of astonishing scope, a revisionary account of cultural theory that seeks to ground it in early modern history, and, above all, a Rembrandt for the Postmod- ern Age. If the King, as Berger defines him, is dead, then long live the King. BRYAN J. WOLF American Studies Program and English Department Yale University PO Box 208236 New Haven, Conn. 06520-8236 Notes 1.

LEE Object to Be Destroyed: The Work of Gordon Matta-Clark Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1999. 280 pp.; 99 ills. $35 The intentions of Object to be Destroyed are extremely ambitious. The author, Pamela Lee, characterizes as "essayistic" and "com- memorative" the contributions that up until this point have been dedicated to the site- specific projects of American artist Gordon Matta-Clark. Lee promises to remedy this state of affairs. How? In three ways, substan- tially: first, by discussing the work of this artist against the background of the artistic prac- tices of the 1960s and 1970s, including site- specific art, process art, minimalism, and con- ceptual art; second, by analyzing the work in its multiple articulations, specifically, build- ing cuts, fragments, photographs, perfor- mances, and culinary experiments; and, fi- nally, by presenting the work as an alternative to the Hegelian model of progress. The two catalogues that were published on this artist (from the retrospectives at the Mu- seum of Contemporary Art in Chicago in 1985 and at the IVAM in Valencia in 1992) analyze the individual works in all their inflec- tions and contain a remarkable number of the most significant interviews and essays writ- ten on the artist, several of which, such as the contributions by Judith Russi Kirshner and Dan Graham, are excellent. The catalogues are furnished with magnificent illustrations both in color and in black-and-white. These publications, in short, fulfill the task of a cat- alogue and should not be faulted for lacking a unified thematic approach. Lee, by contrast, organizes her monograph around six themes, which she develops in the introduction and five chapters and supple- ments with black-and-white reproductions of a few works. Through these means, together with long historical and theoretical digres- sions, the author attempts to demonstrate her thesis. While the book enriches the reader from the perspective of information and stim- ulates reflections on places, characters, move- ments, and poetics, the impression that re- mains in the end is of a rift between the theoretical apparatus and the work. The di- gressions, often too drawn out and self-indul- gent, do not in fact seem to foster our com- prehension of the work but rather almost take us further away from it. "How does one approach an artist whose mode of production is bound up with the work's destruction?" (p. xiii). The question posed by Lee at the opening of the text re- mains largely unanswered. Maintaining a bal- ance between the reading of the artist's work and the thematic openings suggested by it is,</page><page sequence="2">570 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 3 to be sure, extremely difficult. As a compari- son, one may think of Rosalind Krauss's 1993 essay dedicated to Sol LeWitt, "The LeWitt Matrix." Krauss's point of departure is a work entitled Autobiography and the way in which LeWitt employs the grid as a container of the image. She leads us back to this same theme at the essay's conclusion. Her central discus- sion, articulated through a series of points, enlarges the general scope without ever de- taching itself from the work. The only excep- tion to this accomplishment occurs in her fourth point, where LeWitt's sketches of 1958, inspired by Piero della Francesca's cycle on the Legend of the Cross, become a pretext for an overly long dissertation on the master of Arezzo. Let us now follow Matta-Clark along the path that Lee has mapped out for us. The theme of the introduction is "Gordon Matta- Clark and the question of 'work."' Lee main- tains that to speak of "work" in relation to Matta-Clark is a paradox: the artist in fact preaches an "unbuilding"; he offers us not a "total, finished and whole" product, accord- ing to the rules of Western aesthetics, but only residues, fragments, films, documents. He compels us, finally, toward a dynamic and temporalized fruition, "radically destabilizing the terms of aesthetic experience through their dramatic shifts in scale and vertiginous mode of address" (p. xiv). And she concludes, "Matta-Clark's art forcefully registers its work- less character ... in contrast to an artistic 'work' he offered instead a kind of artistic play-an idea of art as practice or use" (pp. xiii, xiv). While his projects with buildings in the process of destruction could lead us to assimilate Matta-Clark's work with perfor- mance, and despite the fact that the posthu- mous photographic testimony might position his work within the realm of conceptual "de- materialization," Lee points out to us, "His practice frustrates the conventions of 'work' without reifying absence as popular concep- tualist accounts were wont to do" (p. xv). I believe, rather, that the work of Matta- Clark remains absolutely rooted in its time, and in the contradictory events that charac- terize that time. Already in 1965, for example, when Matta-Clark was still a student at Cor- nell University, the philosopher Richard Wollheim introduced for the first time the term minimal art, by which he meant a "min- imal artistic content. I suspect that the prin- cipal cause of our resistance derives from the fact that those objects do not present that which for centuries has been considered a fundamental ingredient: work, that is, a man- ifest effort."' According to Wollheim, we need to reconsider the significance of "mak- ing a work of art" and to introduce a new category, one that would be simultaneously "destructive and creative, consisting in the demolition of that which the artist deems in excess."2 The "workless" aspect, then, is al- ready inherent in the three-dimensional minimalist object. In regard to the destabili- zation produced by the dramatic shift in scale, Robert Morris explains to us in his "Notes on Sculpture" (1966) that, despite its geometric and assertive appearance, the form of minimalist objects is not constant but varies according to the movements of the viewer and according to the conditions of the sur- rounding environment. And he explains that "there are two distinct factors: the known con- stant and the experienced variable. Only the apprehension of the gestalt is immediate while the experience of the work remains necessarily in time."3 Richard Serra echoes Morris in discussing his work Shift from 1970: "I was searching for the dialectic between the perception of place in its totality and the relationship established with it while one walks."4 Finally, regarding the "not finished, not total, not whole" character of Matta- Clark's work, the manifesto "Anti Form," writ- ten by Morris in 1968, had established the primacy of process over result and the choice of organic refuse as materials, organized in open, precarious, reversible, and perishable configurations. As for the refusal of the logic of progress and of growth, already in 1962, in The Shape of Time, George Kubler distinguished between the biological model and the scientific one, opting for the second. "Biological time," he explains, "consists in uninterrupted periods of statistically predictable duration. Historical time, instead, is intermittent and variable."5 It is like the light emitted from Dan Flavin's Diagonal of May 25, 1963: a floating, insistent image which, by its luster, betrays its physical presence in a near invisibility, an image that can be assumed as an emblem of "historical time." Kubler's book, which gave theoretical support to the serial option, the impersonal and industrial characteristic of "specific ob- jects," enjoyed great success among the mini- malist coterie. In 1966, reviewing for Artforum the show entitled Primary Structures hosted by the Jewish Museum (which represented the first public appearance of minimalism), Rob- ert Smithson speaks of "Entropy and the New Monuments." He explains, The work of many of these artists celebrate what Flavin calls "inactive history" and what the physicists define as "entropy" or "loss of energy." . . . Rather than inducing us to remember the past, like the old mon- uments, these new ones push us to forget the future. They are not constructed for the years but rather against them. The past and the future are placed in the objective present. This kind of time has little or no space. It is stationary and immobile, it is against the hands of the clock.6 This, then, is the soil in which Matta-Clark took his first steps, precisely between 1966 and 1968, at the height of the minimalist movement and in the most creative phase of the process art movement. Matta-Clark's piece entitled Museum (1970), where heterogeneous waste materials are sus- pended from ropes, evokes in a surprising way Rope Piece by Eva Hesse from the same year. Photo-Fry, a Polaroid of Christmas trees fried in a pan, and Incendiary Wafers, where mixtures of organic and inorganic materials undergo the same fate, concem the chemical conversion of material from one state to another. As will be confirmed in the successive works involving ar- chitecture, the problem that concems Matta- Clark is not at all the refusal or destruction of the object but, rather, its transformation, the violent, traumatic, theatrical passage from one state to another: from architecture to object, from object to fragment and to photographic reproduction. Cut, eviscerated, sliced: the buildings on which Matta-Clark operates lose their status as functioning organisms as they become transformed into sculpture and image. In other words, Matta-Clark accomplishes with architecture an operation analogous to what the minimalists and the process artists accom- plish with sculpture when they deprive it of its anthropomorphic and immortal aspects. Let us take a step back, to Matta-Clark's "The First Place," which serves as the title and subject of Lee's first chapter. There are two key places and figures: Matta-Clark's home and his father, Surrealist painter Roberto Matta, and Cornell Univer- sity and the artist Robert Smithson. In treat- ing the first pair, Lee uses as a point of de- parture a photograph taken in 1942 in the father's home, showing the newborn Gordon next to Alberto Giacometti's sculpture Invisi- ble Object. From this photograph she draws various arguments, which extend over six pages: the anticonformist climate cultivated in the father's house, owing to the presence of the Surrealists in exile; the father's aban- donment of the family when Gordon and his twin brother were only a few months old; the resulting ambivalent attitude of the son to- ward his father, at once rejecting and desiring approval. Lee also forges poetic analogies be- tween father and son, as when she compares Matta's disagreement with the rationalism of Le Corbusier to Matta-Clark's disagreement with architectonic functionalism, and again when she marks the transition of both men from the role of architect to that of artist. Already this chapter reveals a few method- ological vices. To dwell on considerations of a psychological character, for example, partic- ularly the conflicted relationship (and one that is, frankly, obvious) that every male child enters into with an omnipotent father, dis- tracts us from the crucial point of defunction- alization. Matta-Clark declared in 1973 that the home is "a machine for not living" and then announced A W-Hole House in the same year and Splitting the following year. Lee touches on the problem but does not develop it deeply. In fact, she does not even mention that Sol LeWitt, in "Paragraphs on Concep- tual Art" (1967), paraphrased Le Corbusier in his statement that "the idea is a machine which realizes art."7 In this way LeWitt distin- guishes between architecture and three-di- mensional art: "The first concerns itself with creating areas for a specific function. In order not to fail in its purpose, architecture-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 571 whether or not it be a work of art-must be functional. Art is not functional."8 The chal- lenge and the originality of Matta-Clark con- sist precisely in his transformation of architec- ture into an artistic object by means of a spectacular deconstructive action that de- prives it of all functionality. To return to A W-Hole House: in the rigidly symmetrical structure of a warehouse in Genoa, Matta-Clark removed the center of the roof and made two parallel incisions along the walls. The operation radically un- dermined the building's functional organiza- tion, which was based on the existence of small, isolated, and self-sufficient spaces. But the work also had an ethical and social di- mension, which Lee characterizes as remov- ing "the architectural barriers between own- ers and workers" (p. 12). Moving on to Splitting, a suburban house in NewJersey that Matta-Clark literally cut in half, Lee goes off on a tangent, this time too brief, on the ty- pology of the suburban house. She traces its itinerary from the colonial epoch to the 19th century, the period in which the suburban house comes to represent an alternative to the cities for the well-to-do classes in search of privacy. After World War II there was a boom of this very type, offered on a large scale at affordable prices and in obsessively homoge- neous prototypes, easily transportable and erectable. Lee fails to mention that "splitting" is the response to the "American dream" of the suburban house, the same response that in those turbulent years was expressed by slo- gans such as "the personal is political" and "the private is public." In fact, Matta-Clark declares: Buildings are fixed entities in the minds of most people. The notion of mutable space is taboo, especially in one's own house. People live in their space with a temerity that is frightening. Homeowners generally do little more than maintain their prop- erty. Once an institution like the home is objectified in such a way, it does under- standably raise moral issues [such as] to open a state of enclosure which had been preconditioned not only by physical neces- sity but by the industry that profligates suburban and urban boxes as a context for ensuring a passive, isolated consumer-a virtually captive audience. (p. 26) This omission leaves Lee silent on so central a figure as Dan Graham. With the publication of Homes for America in 1966, Graham under- took a strenuous battle against conformism and privacy, both architecturally and socially.9 While Homes for America is a conceptual work, in 1978 Graham translated that polemic into architectonic reality: in Alteration of a Subur- ban House, he knocks down the facade of a suburban house and puts a huge window in its place. In this way, Graham shatters the dream of privacy and places private space at the mercy of the public-exactly what we see happening in Splitting. However, the affinities between the two artists end here: where Gra- ham leaves the photography of Homes for America in order to approach architecture with the construction of his pavilions, Matta- Clark follows the opposite course, from archi- tectonic reality to photographic testimony. The second "first place" indicated by Lee is Cornell University, where Matta-Clark studied from 1962 to 1968, taking several undergrad- uate courses in architecture and urban plan- ning. Lee refers in detail to the School of Architecture's internal debate between the "socio-populist platform," supported by the German Oswald Matthias Ungers (later a pro- tagonist of postmodernism), and the "contex- tualism" of Colin Rowe, with whom Matta- Clark studied. This second view set itself against the utopian and "placeless" project of rationalism and vindicated the mutual rela- tion between building and context. Peter Eisenman was also among the faculty. (His relationship with Matta-Clark will be dis- cussed further on.) There were many artists studying at Cornell, from Alan Saret to Joan Simon to Will Insley. Above all, however, it was there that in 1969 the decisive meeting with Robert Smithson took place, on the oc- casion of the Earth Show. At Cornell, then, process art, in which Saret played a leading role, was as alive as the "entropic" thought of Smithson. We have spoken about Photo-Fry and Museum; Rope Bridge, created at Cornell in 1968, is considered by Matta-Clark to be "the" first work. An environmental piece, it consists of a bridge of rope stretched to link the two slopes of a deep valley. What is its novelty? It is to resort to rope, process material par ex- cellence, as constructive material, means to render that structure unstable and precari- ous, and thus impracticable-exactly like the long inflated tube that in the same year crossed the Cornell campus as an alternative and labyrinthine path. In short, then, Matta- Clark already envisions these first projects more as objects than as functional structures. Lee does not grasp this aspect because she is too caught up in the entropic character of the Cornell landscape, the work of Frederick Law Olmsted, who also created New York's Cen- tral Park. The second chapter, "Improper Objects of Modernity," explores "Matta-Clark's early in- vestigations into buildings and architecture, works that are deeply inscribed in the history of property in lower Manhattan, and the larger 'problem' of the city in the sixties and seventies" (p. 58). The story begins in 1970, when Matta-Clark moves to Manhattan and earns a living by restructuring decayed build- ings: "I was living in the basement at 112 Greene Street and doing things in different corners. Initially, they weren't at all related to the structure, I was just working in a place, but eventually I started treating the place as a whole, as an object" (p. 59). This declaration confirms the lack of interest in an architec- tonic (that is, constructive and functional) problematic: the difference between "struc- ture" and "object" is central. Indeed, it is the same difference as that suggested by Matta- Clark between "architecture" and "building" when he explains he works not on architec- ture but on buildings. At this point Lee em- barks on a long parenthesis on the history of 112 Greene Street, inaugurated in 1970 by Jeffrey Lew, and the most important of the alternative spaces that proliferated in Soho as a counterpoint to the midtown galleries. Cherry Tree, Time Well, and Winter Garden, works created by Matta-Clark in that place in 1971, presented two apparently antagonistic aspects: through excavation and removal, they revealed neglected spaces, such as foun- dations. At the same time, they built struc- tures utilizing refuse. In the first case, we witness a tree planted in the building's foun- dation; in the second, some remains of that same tree are planted in the flue of the fire- place that sinks into the same hole. "What I wanted to do I didn't accomplish at all, which was digging deep enough so that a person could see the actual foundations, the 're- moved' spaces under the foundation, and lib- erate the building's enormous compressive, confining forces simply by making a hole," explains Matta-Clark (p. 67). Winter Garden, instead, consists of the construction, in the same underground space, of a wall made of used bottles. Winter Garden is from the year after Garbage Wall, a wall erected with refuse in the course of a performance at St. Mark's Church in New York. The use of waste mate- rial, cheap and entropic, is certainly not the perquisite of Matta-Clark; one need think only of the contemporary Threadwaste or Dirt of Morris or of the disseminations of Barry LeVa. However, while these last examples look "Beyond the Object," as Morris entitles the final installment of "Notes on Sculpture," Matta-Clark molds objects, however transitory and perishable. In Bronx Floors and Wall Paper of 1972, the two modes-removal and con- struction-find their synthesis in architec- ture. Slices of floor and walls are pulled out of their original sites in order to be exhibited at 112 Greene Street. Matta-Clark had pointed out: "Why hang things on a wall when the wall itself is so much more a challenging medium? It is the rigid mentality that architects install the walls and artists decorate them that of- fends my sense of either profession" (p. 67). Matta-Clark's maxim significantly evokes the pronouncement of Sol LeWitt regarding wall drawings. But while LeWitt's conclusion is to paint directly on the wall, fully respecting the two dimensionality of the architectonic sup- port, Matta-Clark literally takes a piece of the wall and exhibits it as if it were a sculpture. Lee's reference to minimalism is pertinent in this regard: "In this expansion or rather ex- tension into a new social space, the fragments provided an incisive recoding of minimalist sculpture. They literalized the quotidian di- mensions of architectural space by submitting its ground to artistic appraisal" (p. 77). If the minimalist objects, in their asceticism, echo the architectonic box, Bronx Floors provides a strong contrast between an architecture- sculpture that is experienced, lacerated, and butchered and a neutral, expository con- tainer. Wall Paper, which consists of photo- graphs of wallpaper taken from poor and de-</page><page sequence="4">572 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 3 caying contexts, occupies an entire wall. Both Bronx Floors and Wall Paper are prophetic works: they introduce sculptural fragment and photographic evidence as unique proofs of projects that have disappeared. In the final two paragraphs of the chapter, Lee confronts the theme of the relation be- tween art and property. Focusing on Fake Es- tates (1973) she takes off on a long digression on the history of Soho. Beginning at the end of the 18th century, when it was a "posh res- idential neighborhood" (p. 90), Lee follows its history through the 19th century, when the zone was transformed into a "commercial hub" with the construction of cast-iron build- ings, and concludes with the decay that fol- lowed World War II, the exodus of the pop- ulation, and the destruction of more than six hundred of its cast-iron buildings between 1959 and 1962. The recovery of the district was part of the general process of urban re- newal that took place in the 1960s, accompa- nied by what Lee defines as the "push-pull dynamic among industry, land speculators and city inhabitants" (p. 92). Thus, around 1955, when the City Planning Commission of New York wanted to transform Soho from an "industrial slum to an expanding corporate and financial center," its plan met with stren- uous resistance from the inhabitants and art- ists who had illegally occupied the lofts. In 1961 two events took place simultaneously. While Jane Jacobs published The Death and Life of Great American Cities, postulating the recuperation of obsolete areas, a group of artists created the Artists Tenants Association to obtain the right to live legally in the occu- pied lofts. Article 7B of the New York State Multiple Dwelling Law, approved in 1964, granted artists a special status allowing them to live in those places. The artists here be- came a sort of privileged class, acquiring res- idential rights denied to other inhabitants of the district. Matta-Clark's artistic life and po- litical consciousness find their roots in this soil: vindicating abandoned areas and struc- tures meant standing against the appetites of urban and land speculation. "Work with abandoned structures began with my concern for the life of the city of which a major side effect is the metabolization of old buildings. The availability of empty and neglected struc- tures was a prime textual reminder of the ongoing fallacy of renewal through modern- ization," declared Matta-Clark (p. 94) with an attitude analogous to that of Smithson when he reclaimed entropic territory for his gran- diose projects of earth art. After the long discussion of the history of Soho, Lee points out to us that Fake Estates "moves beyond the historical and spatial con- ditions of early SoHo to think more broadly about the question of property altogether" (p. 98). In this work, Matta-Clark delved into "gutterspace," that is, spaces that lie outside the "lot" as defined by architects and city planners. Matta-Clark acquired about fifteen of these spaces in Queens and Staten Island. The work, anything but alluring, consists of the written and photographic documentation of those "false" properties, complete with ac- counts of their size, location, and even the kind of vegetation that grows in them. Its significance lies in the fact that Matta-Clark becomes the owner of land with no value, impractical because it runs along the borders of other properties, and thus cannot be made functional. An additional possible reading suggests the desecration of another "Ameri- can dream": the possession of land. "On Matta-Clark's 'Violence'; or, What Is a 'Phenomenology of the Sublime'?" is the her- metic title of the third chapter. The works focused on here include Day's End of 1975 and Circus of 1978. Up until this moment I have indicated architectonic defunctionaliza- tion as the heart of Matta-Clark's work, a pro- cess understood as the passage from architec- tonic organism to artistic object. Day's End and above all Circus, in adopting for the first time the curve rather than the cut, offer an extraordinary lesson in spatial richness and complexity. Matta-Clark proclaims: "There are certain kinds of pieces that can be sum- marized from a single view. And then there are other ones which interest me more, fi- nally, which have a kind of internal complex- ity which doesn't allow for a single or overall view.... I like it for a number of reasons, one of which is that it does defy that category of a 'snapshot' project or a sort of snapshot scenic work" (p. 137). And again: "I think that the projects are all different versions of some kind of preoccupation with a dynamic. The thing I would really like to express is the idea of transforming the static, enclosed condition of architecture on a very mundane level into this kind of architecture which incorporates ... this sort of animated geometry or this animated tenuous relationship between void and surface" (p. 153). Circus, the last work, and the only one commissioned, realizes those principles: dynamism, multiple points of view, animated geometry, dialectic be- tween empty and full. In the plan and in section, the project shows three circles aligned along the diagonal of a box-shaped building: an elementary geometry, then, in a basic construction. But when this design be- comes three dimensional, its simplicity is transformed into a dizzying complexity: empty and full continually exchange roles, translating the dialectic of "figure-ground" into that of "figure-figure." And that is not all. The relationship between the clarity of the design and the spatial complexity confirms the postminimalist nature of Matta-Clark's work. As John Baldessari explains, "Gordon was a second-generation Minimalist in that some of the dissatisfaction and restlessness, not with the ideas but with the execution of Minimalist art, are evident in his work. He made the transition between Minimalist con- cept and a kind of expressionist execution. You could say he was a messy Minimalist: he liked big rough edges" (pp. 134-35). Baldes- sari's analysis appears reductive; it is not merely a question of rough as opposed to sharp edges or of wrinkled as opposed to flat and smooth surfaces. Rather, the issue at stake is the impossibility of leading spatial experience back to rational and verifiable ma- trices. The sense of the fourth chapter, dedicated to "The Holes of History," is found in its concluding remarks: From "Conical Intersect" to "Descending Steps for Batan," Matta-Clark's Parisian work assumes no productive relationship to changes in a site; engages no ideal of progress for its own sake, and thus little of the "work" that site-specific art is often alleged to perform. Nihilistic, perhaps, but "revolutionary" in their nihilism, these "workless" projects offer a cogent political critique framed repeatedly through the form of the hole.... Challenging any claims to an essentialized community of spectators, his work produces a viewership founded on loss, not the fullness of pro- ductive or performative experience. (pp. 207-9) Lee, then, returns to the "workless" character of Matta-Clark's art, this time applying the description to the relation between places and the communities that inhabit them. That is, Matta-Clark does not create "political" work in the strict sense; he does not share in "objectives" or in the struggle to obtain them. Instead, he shares with the community, by means of the metaphor of the hole, a sense of loss. According to Lee, this would explain the failure of initiatives extended to help weak sectors of the population, such as the Re- source Center and Environmental Youth Pro- gram for Loisada of 1977 and the Arc de Triomphe for Workers of 1975. The first was a center on the Lower East Side where young people were taught how to restore aban- doned buildings. The second was an attempt to create a social center out of a building occupied by young Communists in Sesto S. Giovanni in Milan. Lee's writing here, unlike in the other chap- ters, is fluid and balanced. The digressions do not interrupt the main thread of the discussion but rather enrich it, providing useful back- ground to the works she examines. In this chap- ter, Lee focuses on the Parisian works, from Conical Intersect to those set underground. Con- ical Intersect, "more than any of his other works, neatly illustrated the tension between narratives of historical progress-embodied in the con- struction of the Centre Pompidou-and the destruction of historical site that is a prerequi- site for progress" (p. 171). The author proceeds along both these tracks. On the one hand, she traces the history of Beaubourg from 1968, when it was conceived as a center for contem- porary art. She goes on to look at the interna- tional competition won by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, the construction of the enor- mous transparent and flexible technological machine, and, finally, the heated polemics that it elicited. On the other hand, she reviews the vicissitudes of Les Halles, the market district in which the museum complex is located, from its origins in 1137 to the 19th century, when iron and glass pavilions lent the market a modem and permanent aspect. She continues to trace</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 573 its history through its decay in the 20th century, concluding with the relocation of the market in 1961 and the destruction of the pavilions two years later. Given the centrality of its position, "Le trou des Halles" represented a serious tear in the urban fabric, comparable for the Pari- sians to the slaughter carried out by Baron Haussmann's resolute demolitions. The wound remained untreated until 1976, when the much debated Forum des Halles project was realized. Even if Lee points out that Matta-Clark "did not consciously employ the hole as an icon of the situation," the peculiar form of Conical Intersect "appeared to touch some collective psychic nerve, of which the artist had limited under- standing. Its audience reacted to Matta-Clark's work in a manner that can be considered both site-specific and community-less, as if gathered around the passing of its own communal hori- zon" (pp. 189-91). A telescopic view from the outside and a periscopic view from the inside permit, as expressed by Walter Benjamin, "tele- scoping the past with the present" (p. 184), allowing the viewer to peer at the old buildings through that spyglass. The hole, in short, be- comes "a cipher of the area's destruction and modernization," the emblem of the joint be- tween history and current events. "The next area that interests me is an ex- pedition into the underground: a search for the forgotten spaces left buried under the city as historical reserve or as surviving reminders of lost projects and fantasies" (p. 198), de- clares Matta-Clark in relation to his environ- mental works in the underground spaces of Paris. Anticipated by Cherry Tree and Time Well, which investigated the foundations of 112 Greene Street, Underground Paris and Sous-sol de Paris are, respectively, a sequence of pho- tographs of the underground spaces of Les Halles, Notre-Dame, the Paris Opera, and St- Michel and a film in black-and-white about the sewer system. Descending Steps for Batan, in memory of his twin brother who had killed himself from Gordon's studio, consists of a deep hole dug out in the foundations of the Yvonne Lambert gallery in Paris. The hole once again displays a lack, a loss, and ap- proaches the deep, unexplored spaces, in contrast to the new, immaculate spaces of the exhibition rooms. The concluding chapter, entitled "To Be Contemporary," confronts the crucial theme, already the object of Hans Belting's very im- portant contribution, of the relation between history and contemporaneity. Lee declares: "Matta-Clark's death solicits a range of ques- tions about the nature of contemporaneity and contemporary history. It calls up the seeming paradox of writing a history, an ac- count of pastness, of things that are of the relative present" (p. 214). In other words, the problem arises when history is made of events that have just transpired, whose temporal proximity do not allow us to acquire that indispensable detachment from them. Lee approaches this question from the point of view of the legitimacy of contemporary artists and architects calling themselves inheritors of Matta-Clark. In her opinion, such an appro- priation is not only illegitimate but actually betrays the original intentions of the artist: There is a supreme irony in thinking about recent architecture in terms of Matta-Clark's practice-one need only re- call Matta-Clark's behavior at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in 1976 to gauge his attitude toward the field. Nonetheless, names ranging from Frank Gehry to SITE are routinely invoked in the same breath as Matta-Clark. Likewise, the word "deconstruction" is erroneously linked to his work, as if to appeal to literal disassembling of buildings as well as the theoretically acute notion of "deconstruc- tivist" architecture. No doubt many archi- tects genuinely respect the artist's work on its own terms, but a gross pseudomor- phism takes place when Matta-Clark and these figures are leveled to the same visual field. The affinities suggested by writers on the subject represent a failure to acknowl- edge the critical and historical motivations of the artist's project. (p. 215) Lee, in fact, is espousing the opinion ex- pressed by Yve-Alain Bois in "Threshole" of 1997: "Matta-Clark considers architecture to be a clownish and pretentious undertaking, and he would indeed be quite furious to see himself taken as a model, to see his provi- sional demolitions codified under the label of deconstructionism."10 How is it possible-this is the heart of the issue-that architects suc- cessful in their profession can proclaim them- selves to be followers of a rebellious, nihilistic artist, an artist who hates architecture to the point of torturing it as it awaits its demolition, who scorns the profession to such a point as to open fire at the windows of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York when Peter Eisenman invited him to the show Idea as a Model? In exact opposition to Lee, I consider the phenomenon of Matta-Clark's reception by architects historically legitimate and poeti- cally vital. I am supported in this view by Alois Riegl, whose essay "The Modern Cult of Mon- uments" (1903) is mentioned by Lee in her first chapter. As Kurt W. Forster explains, the concept of Kunstwollen introduced by Riegl removes artistic values and aesthetic judg- ments from an idealistic realm and anchors them in the contingencies of particular ep- ochs. That is, neither values nor model ep- ochs exist with which one could judge preced- ing or successive epochs. Thus, Forster concludes: When Riegl argued for the historical con- tingency of all aesthetic values, he did not by the same token advocate eclecticism. On the contrary, he recognized that con- temporary concerns, the Kunstwollen of our epoch, profoundly determine our per- ceptions of the past: there is no objective past, constant over time, but only a con- tinual refraction of the absent in the mem- ory of the present.1l The Kunstwollen with which we read the work of Matta-Clark today is decisively distant from that with which the same work was read in the 1970s. I have said that the climate in which Matta-Clark worked was characterized by an irrepressible urge toward rebellion and pro- test. This protest was aimed at the traditional exhibition circuits, at the well-packaged artis- tic object, at the market, and above all, at the progressivist optimism that subtended the modernist idiom and ideology. I have re- ferred to the way in which Matta-Clark viewed his decision to work on abandoned and de- caying buildings as "a prime textual reminder of the ongoing fallacy of renewal through modernization" (p. 90). That sense of failure is shared by Dan Graham, who, in "Art in Relation to Architecture/Architecture in Re- lation to Art," denounces the betrayal of the perspectives of progress and social justice im- plicit in the modern project. It is also shared by Sol LeWitt when he shows a preference for the ziggurat over the slab typology of the skyscraper, emblem of the International Style. In so protesting the sclerosis of the modern-protests that have nothing to do with postmodern cynicism and roguery-art- ists and architects proceed in concert. In this regard I have mentioned Colin Rowe; it is necessary in addition to remember Robert Venturi's Complexity and Contradictions in Ar- chitecture, where the author augurs a complex and contradictory architecture based on the richness and the ambiguity of modern expe- rience. And we must recall Peter Eisenman himself, when he formulates the hypothesis of conceptual architecture. Judith Kirshner con- firms this in "Non-uments" when she de- clares, "The hybrid art of Matta-Clark is inex- tricable from architecture and the work which it reflects most directly is that of Robert Venturi, the Venturi of Complexity and Con- tradiction in Architecture."12 Matta-Clark's poetics, then, is perfectly rooted in its time. Today, art and architecture exist in a completely changed condition. The ill-omened page of postmodern historicism has been definitively turned. The generation of architects exhibited in the show Deconstruc- tivist Architecture (curated in 1988 by a "repen- tant" Philip Johnson at the Museum of Mod- ern Art in New York), to which must be added the effusive and brilliant personality of Frank Gehry vindicate again the primacy of space over style, a complex and disarticulated space, dynamic and pluralistic, like that pro- claimed by Matta-Clark: "From the line to the plane, and to the multiplicity of planes, and up to the volume or to something beyond volume, a sort of dynamic volume. And that dynamic volume is what in the final analysis interests me the most" (p. 92). The mission of the "anarchitect" is to oper- ate in a precarious and provisional way on buildings destined for demolition, thus shar- ing their fate. This mission might be realized by the removal of walls and floors, the de- struction of the caesuras between planes and between internal and external, the multipli- cation and complication of points of view and of perspectives, or the unveiling of founda- tions or of the stratification of walls. Such a mission constitutes a great lesson in architec-</page><page sequence="6">574 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2001 VOLUME LXXXIII NUMBER 3 tonic and spatial terms, a warning for who- ever opts instead for the profession. Anarchi- tecture is not simply a great ethical warning against capitalistic exploitation, against a merely utilitarian conception of habitation. Its extraordinary aesthetic value consists pre- cisely in its pointing to architecture as ac- tion-as opposed to abstractly and geometri- cally conceived containers-as a continual metamorphosis of our own space and the space that surrounds us. I am convinced that Matta-Clark would not be at all angry to see himself taken as a model of the extraordinary rebirth of architecture; rather, he would be proud to see the spatial richness of his "objects to be destroyed" living again in the astonishing sculptural spaces of Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum or in the re- bellious and angry spaces of the Jewish Mu- seum in Berlin. In the 1983 essay on Matta- Clark, did not Dan Graham place the photograph of Conical Intersect next to that of the Gehry house in Santa Monica?
