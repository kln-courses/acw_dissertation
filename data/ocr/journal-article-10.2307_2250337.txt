<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. BY CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON. I. A " PERSUASIVE" definition is one which gives a new conceptual meaning to a familar word without substantially changing its emotive meaning, and which is used with the conscious or un- conscious purpose of changing, by this means, the direction of people's interests. The object of this paper is to show that persuasive definitions are often used in philosophy, and that the widespread failure to recognise them for what they are-the temptation to consider them as definitions which merely abbreviate, or which analyse, common concepts-has led to important philosophical confusions. Before considering philosophical examples, however, it will be helpful to consider some simpler ones, which will serve to make clearer what persuasive definitions are. As an initial example let us take a definition of the word " culture ". It will be convenient to invent pure fictions about the linguistic habits of the people to whom the definition is ad- dressed; for this will typify the actual situation in a way that is free from complicating irrelevancies. Let us consider, then, a hypothetical community in which " culture " began by having an almost purely conceptual meaning. Let us sketch the de- velopment of its emotive meaning, show why the emotive mean- ing led certain people to redefine the word, and examine the way in which this redefinition achieved its purpose. There was once a community in which "cultured " meant widely read and acquainted with the arts. In the course of time these qualities came into high favour. If one man wanted to pay another a compliment, he would dwell at length upon his culture. It became unnatural to use " cul- ture " in any but a laudatory tone of voice. Those who lacked culture used the word with awe, and those who possessed it used the word with self-satisfaction, or perhaps with careful modesty. In this way the word acquired a strong emotive</page><page sequence="2">332 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: meaning. It awakened feelings not only because of its conceptual meaning, but more directly, in its own right; for it recalled the gestures, smiles, and tone of voice which so habitually accom- panied it. A public speaker, for instance, was never introduced as " a man widely read and acquainted with the arts ". He was described, rather, as " a man of culture ". The latter phrase had no different conceptual meaning than the former, but was more suitable for awakening in the audience a favourable attitude. As the emotive meaning of the word grew more pronounced, the conceptual meaning grew more vague. This was inevitable, for the emotive meaning made the word suitable for use in meta- phors. Men who were not cultured, literally, were often called so, particularly when they were admired for having some of the defining qualities of " culture ". At first people readily dis- tinguished these metaphorical compliments from literal state- ments; but as the metaphors grew more frequent, the distinction became less clear. People weren't quite sure whether a person must know about the arts in order to be literally cultured. Per- haps some other kind of knowledge would serve as a substitute. Let us now suppose that one member of the community had no wholehearted regard for mere reading, or mere acquaintance with the arts, but valued them only to the extent that they served to develop imaginative sensitivity. He felt that they were not always a reliable means to that end, and on no account the only means. It was his constant source of regret that such mechanical procedures as reading, or visiting museums, should win instant praise, and that sensitivity should scarcely be noticed. For this reason he proceeded to give " culture " a new meaning. " I know ", le insisted, " that so and so is widely read, and acquainted with the arts; but what has that to do with culture ? The real meaning of ' culture ', the true meaning of ' culture ', is imaginative sensitivity." He persisted in this statement, in spite of the fact that " culture " had never before been used in exactly this sense. It will now be obvious that this definition was no mere ab- breviation; nor was it intended as an analysis of a common concept. Its purpose, rather, was to redirectpeople's interests. " Culture " had and would continue to have a laudatory emotive meaning. The definition urged people to stop using the lauda- tory term to refer to reading and the arts, and to use it, instead, to mean imaginative sensitivity. In this manner it sought to place the former qualities in a poor light, and the latter in a fine one, and thus to redirect people's admiration. When people learn to call something by a name rich in pleasant associations,</page><page sequence="3">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 333 they more readily admire it; and when they learn not to call it by such a name, they less readily admire it. The definition made use of this fact. It changed interests by changing names. The past history of " culture " facilitated the change. The emotive meaning of the word, it is true, had grown up because of the old conceptual meaning; but it was now so firmly estab- lished that it would persist even though the conceptual meaning were somewhat altered. The old conceptual meaning was easily altered, since it had been made vague by metaphorical usage. The definition could effect a change in conceptual meaning, then, which left the emotive meaning unaltered. Thanks again to vagueness, the change seemed a " natural " one, which, by escaping the attention of the hearers, did not remind them that they were being influenced, and so did not stultify them by making them self-conscious. The effectiveness of the definition lay partly in this, and partly in the fact that it made its results permanent by embedding them in people's very linguistic habits. The definition may be called " persuasive ", then, in a quite conventional sense. Like most persuasive definitions, it was in fact doubly persuasive. It at once dissuaded people from in- discriminately admiring one set of qualities (wide reading and acquaintance with the arts) and induced them to admire another (imaginative sensitivity). The speaker wished to attain both of these ends, and was enabled, by his definition, to work for both at the same time. There are hundreds of words which, like " culture ", have both a vague conceptual meaning and a rich emotive meaning. The conceptual meaning of them all is subject to constant re- definition. The words are prizes which each man seeks to bestow on the qualities of his own choice. In the nineteenth century, for instance, critics sometimes remarked that Alexander Pope was " not a poet ". The foolish reply would be, " It's a mere matter of definition ". It is indeed a matter of definition, but not a" mere "one. The word" poet" was used in an extremely narrow sense. This, so far from being idle, had important consequences; it enabled the critics to deny to Pope a laudatory name, and so to induce people to disregard him. A persuasive definition, tacitly employed, was at work in redirecting interests. Those who wish to decide whether Pope was a poet must decide whether they will yield to the critics' influence-whether they will come to dislike Pope enough to allow him to be deprived of an honorary title. This decision will require a knowledge of Pope's works and a knowledge of</page><page sequence="4">334 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: their own minds. Such are the important matters which lie behind the acceptance of the tacitly proposed, narrow definition of " poet ". It is not a matter of " merely arbitrary " definition, then, nor is any persuasive definition " merely arbitrary ", if this phrase is taken to imply " suitably decided by the flip of a coin ". Persuasive definitions are often recognisable from the words " real " or " true ", employed in a metaphorical sense. The speaker in our first example, for instance, was telling us what " real " culture was, as distinct from the " shell" of culture. The following are additional examples: " Charity ", in the true sense of the word, means the giving not merely of gold, but of understanding; true love is the communion between minds alone; " Courage ", in the true sense, is strength against adverse public opinion. Each of these statements is a way of redirecting in- terests, by leaving the emotive meaning of the words unchanged, and wedding it to a new conceptual one. Similarly we may speak of the true meaning of " sportsmanship ", " genius ", " beauty ", and so on. Or we may speak of the true meaning of " selfishness " or " hypocrisy ", using persuasive definitions of these derogatory terms to blame, rather than to praise. " True ", in such contexts, is obviously not used literally. Since people usually accept what they consider true, " true " comes to have the persuasive force of " to be accepted ". This force is utilised in the metaphorical expression " true meaning ". The hearer is induced to accept the new meaning which the speaker intro- duces. Outside the confinements of philosophical theory the im- portance of persuasive definitions has often been recognised. In philology they receive occasional stress. Or rather, although little attention is given to persuasive definitions, much is said about the broad heading under which a study of them would fall: the interplay between emotive and conceptual meanings in determining linguistic change, and its correlation with in- terests. Leonard Bloomfield1 presents us with a particularly clear example: " The speculative builder has learned to appeal to every weakness, including the sentimentality, of the prospec- tive buyer; he uses the speech forms whose content will turn the hearer in the right direction. In many locutions ' house ' is the colorless, and ' home ' the sentimental word. Thus the salesman comes to use the word ' home ' for an empty shell I Language (Henry Holt, N.Y., 1933), p. 442.</page><page sequence="5">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 335 that has never been inhabited, and the rest of us follow his style." Hanns Oertel, having stated that " the emotional element greatly influences the fate of some words ", points out that "amica " came to have one sense which was synonymous with "concubina "2 To be sure there are several reasons for this. "Concubina" had become slightly profane, too strong for delicate ears. And " amica " permitted a convenient ambiguity. Any shocking thoughts could always be ascribed to those who chose to understand the word in its less innocent sense. But a persuasive factor must also have been involved. Tact often required people to refer to concubines without expressing con- tempt. The word " amica ", which retained part of its old laudatory emotive meaning in spite of its new sense, was useful in making concubines appear less contemptible. Persuasive definitions are too frequently encountered, however, to have been noticed solely by the philologists. An extremely penetrating account, in spite of its cynical turn, is given by Aldous Huxley, in his Eyeless in Gaza: " But if you want to be free, you've got to be a prisoner. It's the condition of freedom-true freedom." " True freedom ! " Anthony repeated in the parody of a clerical voice. "I always love that kind of argument. The contrary of a thing isn't the contrary; oh, dear me, no ! It's the thing itself, but as it truly is. Ask any die-hard what conservatism is; he'll tell you it's true socialism. And the brewer's trade papers; they're full of articles about the beauty of true temperance. Ordinary temperance is just gross refusal to drink; but true temperance, true temperance is something much more refined. True temperance is a bottle of claret with each meal and three double whiskies after dinner . " What's in a name ? " Anthony went on. "The answer is, practically everything, if the name's a good one. Freedom's a marvellous name. That's why you're so anxious to make use of it. You think that, if you call imprisonment true freedom, people will be attracted to the prison. And the worst of it is you're quite right." II. As has been intimated, the study of persuasive definitions falls under a much broader heading: the correlation between termin- ology and interests. This correlation is highly complicated. A few observations will serve to show that our account of per- suasive definitions deals with a severely limited aspect of it. A change in meaning may be either a cause or an effect of a change in interest; and persuasive definitions figure only when the change in meaning is a cause. When it is an eflect, as when 1 Lectuires on the Study of Language (Scribner's, N.Y., 1902), pp. 304, 305.</page><page sequence="6">336 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: our growing disapproval of present conditions in Germany causes us to use " fascist " as an epithet, there is not in this situation itself any element of persuasion; although once the word has acquired its derogatory associations, it may be used in persuasion later on. Our subject is still more limited in scope than this. We are concerned with definitions which change interests. And it is important to note that we are concerned only with some of these definitions. Many definitions which redirect interests are not persuasive. Interests tend to be redirected by any definition, so long as it at all changes the meaning of a term, or selects some one sense to the exclusion of others. When a scientist intro- duces a technical term, in no matter how detached a manner, he indicates his interest in what he names-his estimation of the importance of talking about it, or of predicting its occurrence- and he often leads his readers to have a similar interest. It would be quite misleading to call such definitions " persuasive ". How, then, are they to be distinguished from persuasive defi- nitions ? The distinction depends upon whether the term defined has a strong emotive meaning, and upon whether the speaker em- ploys the emotively laden word with dynamic purposes-with the predominating intention of changing people's interests. Men sometimes say, " I do not care what word you use, so long as you make my distinction; " and again, " If you are not interested in my distinction, well and good; I shall confine my remarks to the limited set of people who are ". Definitions given in such a spirit are not persuasive; for although they indicate the speaker's interests, and may happen to influence the hearer's interests, they do not utilise emotive meaning in a deliberate efiort to sway interests. Such a distinction is inconveniently stringent, however, and must be slightly qualified. When a definition is given mainly for the purposes of distinction or classification, when it is used to guide only those interests which (like curiosity) are involved in making the classification understood, and when it in no way suggests that this is -the one legitimate sort of classification, then the definition will not be called persuasive. (This is not meant to imply that persuasive definitions are never used in scientific writings, nor that non-persuasive definitions are based on some rock foundation, nor that persuasive definitions are less respect- able than others.) We must now proceed to a further point. Persuasive defi- nitions redirect interests by changing only the conceptual meaning</page><page sequence="7">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 337 of an emotively laden term, allowing the emotive meaning to remain roughly constant. Clearly, the opposite change is equally important and prevalent: the emotive meaning may be altered, the conceptual meaning remaining constant. This latter device is no less persuasive. In fact, the same persuasive force can often be obtained either by the one linguistic change or by the other. In our initial example of " culture ", for instance, the speaker used a persuasive definition. He might equally well have re- iterated statements such as this: " Culture is only fool's gold; the true metal is imaginative sensitivity ". This procedure would have permitted " culture " to retain its old conceptual meaning, but would have tended to make its emotive meaning derogatory; and it would have added to the laudatory emotive meaning of " imaginative sensitivity ". The same purpose would have been served in this way that was served by the persuasive definition. The qualities commonly referred to by " culture " would still be placed in a poor light, and imaginative sensitivity in a fine one; but this would have been effected by a change in emotive meaning, rather than in conceptual meaning. Cases of this last sort must be excluded from our account of persuasive definitions. Although persuasive, they are not secured through definition, but rather by, one's gestures and tone of voice, or by rhetorical devices such as similes and metaphors. It is expedient to restrict the word " definition " to cases where conceptual meaning alone is being determined, or where, at least, this aspect predominates. We must not forget, however, that many statements which change mainly the emotive meaning of words may, in a wider sense, be called " definitions "; and that they, no less than persuasive definitions in our strict sense, may easily be confused with statements that are not persuasive. (For example: "By ' conscience ' is meant the voice of destiny.") The remarks of the last several pages may be summarised as follows: Persuasive definitions, so far from explaining the whole interrelationship between terminology and interests, deal only with the cases where change in terminology causes change in interest, where emotive meaning and dynamic usage are involved, and where the terminological change is in conceptual meaning only. There is one further clarifying remark that deserves mention. The redirection of people's interests obviously depends upon much more than emotive meaning. It depends as well upon dynamic usage: upon the vigour of the speaker, his gestures, his tone of voice, the cadence of his accompanying sentences, his figures of speech, and so on. It is further conditioned by the</page><page sequence="8">338 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: temperament of the hearers, their respect for the speaker, their susceptibility to suggestion, their latent prejudices and ideals- and indeed, by their factual beliefs, for a sudden change in men's beliefs prepares the way (though often with a " lag ") for a redirection of interests. Persuasion is seldom effective unless the hearers are already on the point of changing their interests. A persuasive definition may then be important as a final impetus to the change, and as a mnemonic device, imbedded in language, for keeping the change permanent. In dwelling upon definitions, then, and upon the function of emotive meaning, we have stressed but one aspect of persuasive situations. There are excellent reasons for this stress, however. Emotive meaning is a fairly stable element amid the widely varying set of factors upon which effective persuasion depends, and although a partial factor, is often essential. When a man redefines an emotively laden term, moreover, he is very frequently endeavouring to persuade, and takes care that the other factors necessary to successful persuasion are fulfilled. Emotive meaning is a re- liable sign of persuasion-permits it to be noticed. This is important in the case of definitions, where persuasion, however legitimate and vital in itself, can so easily acquire a spurious appeal by masking itself in the guise of a logical analysis. III. SHaving explained what persuasive definitions are, let us now see how they are important to philosophy. We can readily begin by considering philosophic definitions of the word " philosophy " itself. Ramsey defines it as a system of definitions. Van der Leeuw defines it as an attempt to pene- trate behind appearances. Their divergence is no terminological accident. " Philosophy " is a dignified term, and each man reserves it for the inquiry he most wishes to dignify. Consider the word " Reality ". Philosophers often seek not reality, but Reality, or rather, true Reality. But " true Reality ", like " true culture ", is easily defined in many different ways, with many different persuasive effects. Were the shadows in Plato's cave Cc real " shadows ? Were there " real " shadows of horses and men, as distinct from the imaginary shadows of centaurs ? It will not do to express it so. "Real " is too im- pressive a term to be used in describing shadows and flux; so it must be given a restricted sense which makes it predicable only of the eternal patterns. (When " Reality " is used by the</page><page sequence="9">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 339 mystics, the effects of a tacit persuasive definition become even more obvious.) Why did Spinoza, so anxious to free thinking from anthropo- morphism, nevertheless tempt his readers to anthropomorphism by using the word " God " ? Why did he not speak always of " The One Substance " ? One points, of course, to the political and social forces of the times, which made a semblance of ortho- doxy imperative. But assuredly this is not all. The word " God " arouses, as if by magic, the very deepest of feelings. By giving the word a new conceptual meaning, Spinoza was enabled to direct its emotional force away from the old anthro- pomorphic fictions, and centre it upon Substance, which he so earnestly thought would be a more rewarding object for all our wonder and humility. Had he said, " There is no God; nothing but Substance and its Modes ", he would have spoken what he believed, provided " God " was used in the popular sense. But this would have been poor economy of the emotions. It would have taken away the object of men's wonder and humility, pro- viding no substitute; and so these feelings would have died, to the great impoverishment of emotional life. The persuasive definition of a word was needed to preserve emotional vitality. The change in the meaning of " God " was too abrupt, however, to escape notice. Spinoza " the atheist " was long in giving place to Spinoza " the God-intoxicated man "; for the supporters of orthodoxy were not slow to see that his God was God in emotive meaning only. These remarks are not to be misconstrued as cynical. To point out persuasion is not necessarily to condemn it, nor to identify all persuasion with that of a mob-orator. It is impera- tive, however, to distinguish between persuasion and rational demonstration. Let us now proceed to a more recent issue. Positivism achieved its wide appeal before Carnap's " principle of tolerance ", and achieved it largely through the statement, " Metaphysics is without meaning ". But isn't this remark surprisingly like that of the nineteenth-century critics, who said that Pope was " not a poet " ? The Positivists were stating an unquestionable truth, in their sense of " meaning ", just as the nineteenth-century critics were, in their sense of " poet ". The truth of such state- ments, however, is utterly beside the point. Controversy hinges on the emotive words that are used. Shall we define " meaning " narrowly, so that science alone will receive this laudatory title, and metaphysics the correspondingly derogatory one of " non- sense " ? Shall our terminology show science in a fine light,</page><page sequence="10">340 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: and metaphysics in a poor one ? Shall we, in short, accept this persuasive definition of "meaning " 2 This is the question, though well concealed by the dictum that definitions are " merely arbitrary ". But this conclusion deserves careful qualification. We must remember that the nineteenth-century critics, to return to the analogy, were not condemning Pope with sheer bombast. They were also making a distinction. Their narrow sense of " poet " had the function of stressing, in the reader's attention, certain features common to most poetry, but lacking in Pope's. Per- haps they meant to say this: "We have long been blind to fundamental differences between Pope's work and that of a Shakespeare or Milton. It is because of this blindness alone that we have been content to give Pope a laudatory title. Let us note the difference, thien, and deprive him of the title." The contention of the Positivists will easily bear the same interpre- tation. Perhaps they meant to say: " We have long been blind to the fundamental differences between the use of sentences in science and their use in metaphysics. It is because of this blindness alone that we have been content to dignify metaphysics with such titles as 'meaningful'. Let us define 'meaning', then, in a way that will at once stress these fundamental differ- ences, and deprive metaphysics of its title." When thus stated the Positivistic thesis has not only heat, but light, and is not to be scorned. And yet, perhaps there is still too much heat for the amount of light. It is of no little service to stress the ways in which metaphysics has been confused with science; and to the extent that Positivists have done this, their " conquest of metaphysics " has not depended upon exhortation. But do their distinctions take us more than half way to a full rejection of metaphysics ? Are we led to go the other half by the word "nonsense ", defined so that it may cast its objectionable emotive meaning upon metaphysics, without being predicated of it untruthfully ? The same question arises even when metaphysics is denied " cognitive " meaning only. " Cognitive " is used to mean " em- pirically verifiable or else analytic ", and with exclusive lauda- tory import. Hence the Positivistic contention reduces to this: " Metaphysical statements are neither empirically verifiable nor analytic; hence they are not respectable." If metaphysicians answer, " Our statements, even though neither empirically veri- fiable nor analytic, are still respectable ", they are scarcely to be led away from their position by mere exhortation. Metaphysical impulses are too strong for hortatory treatment;</page><page sequence="11">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 341 they are inhibited by it without being removed. If metaphysics is wholly to give place to science in our- esteem, this can come only from a closer scrutiny of both metaphysics and science. Inquiries into verification and syntax make a good beginning, but they are not the only points for study. It would be well to consider how words which suggest graphic images and meta- phors are used in the sciences, and contrast their function there with their function in metaphysics; or to examine the psycho- logical needs and specific confusions which lead people to think that metaphysics is necessary. Such inquiries would direct our attitudes toward metaphysics in a more permanent and illuminat- ing fashion; they would shape our attitudes by clarifying and augmenting our beliefs. If an adverse attitude to metaphysics were prepared for in this manner, the word " nonsense ", per- suasively defined, would be helpful in crystallising the attitude. Such a programme seems more promising than that of the meta- physicians. It is a pity, then, to hide its real complexity by using a persuasive definition prematurely. IV. Let us now turn to ethics, with particular attention to the word "justice ", as defined in Plato's Republic. The first book of the Republic, it will be remembered, is largely taken up with an argument between Socrates and Thrasymachus. Socrates is the victor, and yet he is not content. " I have gone from one subject to another ", he says, " without having dis- covered what I sought first, the nature of justice. I left that inquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and folly." (354, Jowett.) Was this argument about the " virtue or evil " of justice really an unwarranted digression ? In the light of our previous dis- cussion, we cannot agree that it was. The argument had the important function of determining whether or not " justice " was to retain its laudatory emotive meaning; and this was essential to the subsequent developments of the dialogue. When a man is about to give a persuasive definition (and we shall see in a moment that Socrates was) he must make sure that the emotive meaning of the term defined is well established. Other- wise a definition which was intended to illuminate a conceptual meaning under a laudatory title will end by obscuring it under a derogatory one. The word " justice ", which is a little too stern to be wholly pleasing, is in danger of becoming derogatory, and particularly so when men like Thrasymachus (with a</page><page sequence="12">342 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: persuasive technique like that mentioned on page 337 above) are using their oratoripal ability to make the word derogatory. Socrates must praise justice, then, before he defines " justice ". The question about the meaning of " justice " reappears in the fourth book. The two intervening books have redirected our interests by a moving description of the ideal state. These new interests must be rendered permanent. This can be done by dignifying the more significant aspects of the state under laudatory titles. Of the four laudatory terms which Socrates mentions, " wisdom ", " courage ", " temperance ", and " justice ", the first three are readily made to serve this purpose, without great change in their conceptual meaning. The remaining term must be reserved for whatever else needs dignity. And so the defi- nition of " justice " is found. "Justice of the state consists of each of the three classes doing the work of its own class." (441). The persuasive character of this definition-the fact that it forms a part of a spirited plea for a new class system, a beautiful and inspired kind of aristocratic propaganda-can scarcely be denied. The usual meanings of " justice" must give place to the " true " one, to the meaning which needs the dignity of a laudatory name. This account would strike Plato as decidedly unfamiliar. Yet he would disagree with it much less fundamentally than may at first appear. Let us follow his own account, stressing such points as bear analogy to the present one. Plato would have agreed that the usual meaning of " justice" was only a point for departure. We must fashion our definition not after the common conception of justice, but after justice itself -after the eternal Idea of justice, which we have beheld in a life before birth, and can now- know only through careful recollection. A definition based on common usage would disclose merely the imperfect recollection of the Idea, as grasped by men bound to the world of opinion. This point of agreement seems slight, and outweighed by the theory of recollection. But let us look more closely~. How did Plato decide whether his recollection was correct ? Did he consider it correct when he reached a conception which satisfied his deepest, inmost aspirations ? Did the dialectical method serve only to clarify his mind, so that his aspirations could be directed to something articulate ? It is difficult to think of any other answer. Plato aspired to the Ideas; but this was not a consequence of some miraculous power of attraction which 'the Ideas possessed. It was a matter of analytic necessity. Any-</page><page sequence="13">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 343 thing which was not an object of his aspirations was not called an Idea. If this is so, then our account is again close to his. If he had consciously been making a persuasive definition, he would still have selected, as the conceptual meaning of " justice ", the object of these same aspirations. Nothing else would have been granted the laudatory name. We have retained the factors which led Plato to make his definition, without retaining the poetic realm of the Ideas, whose function, indeed, was only to adorn his procedure, not to alter its outcome. If Plato's work had been less Utopian, more satirical, he would have had recollections not from one realm of Ideas, but from two. The first realm would have been the dwelling-place of the gods, as described in the Phaedrus; and the second the dwelling-place of the " author of evil " who makes his unexpected appearance in the tenth book of the Laws. Just as aspirations would be the criteria for correct recollection from the first realm, so aversions would be the criteria for correct recollection from the second. The theory of definition would then be less closely confined to the laudatory terms. Recollection could function likewise for the derogatory ones. But it would be of vital importance, in defining the derogatory terms, to confine the recollection to the second realm. The most serious philosophical errors would come from a failure to recollect from the " correct " realm, where the correctness of the realm would depend on the emotive meaning of the term defined. We must return, however, to the definition of " justice " Plato's definition was persuasive; but this is far from being exceptional. Later definitions of " justice ", with but few ex- ceptions, are equally persuasive. They exert a different, kind of influence, of course. Not all philosophers are aristocrats. But they do exert an influence. Let us consider Bentham's definition. " 'Justice', in the only sense which has meaning [!], is an imaginary personage, feigned for the convenience of discourse, whose dictates are the dictates of utility, applied to certain particular cases." 1 More simply stated, " This is a just law " is a hypostatic way of say- ing, " This law contributes to the greatest happiness of the greatest number ". Such a definition may not immediately strike us as being persuasive, since so many of us are willing to be led in its direction. Yet its stress on mere numbers, its stress on counting the poor man's happiness side by side with the rich man's, clearly marks a plea for greater democracy. The definition propagated the ideals of a great Liberal. 1 Principles of Morals and Legislation, 1789, ch. x, sect. xl, n. 2.</page><page sequence="14">344 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: By a " just " wage for labourers, it may be suggested, is meant the wage that anticipates what labourers would get eventually, through operation of the laws of supply and demand, if only there were a perfect market in the economic sense. This defi- nition conceals its persuasion quite well, making it seem to have the detachment of a purely scientific economics. But it is a plea, though slightly compromised, for the operation not of economic laws, but of " natural " economic laws-that is to say, for the operation of economic laws as they could be stated if the purely competitive, " devil take the hindermost ", aspects of industry were guaranteed. So you will find this definition more pleasing to those who thrive under the present industrial con- ditions than to those who do not. " Justice " can be defined in a great many, ways, always with- out shocking the lexicographers. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth ? The keeping of contracts, merely ? The king's will ? The distribution of social wealth in accordance with the amount of labour that each man does ? We have a wide choice of meanings, and freedom, within wide conventional limits, to invent new ones. Which meaning we choose, however, is no trivial matter; for we shall dignify that meaning by a laudatory title. To choose a meaning is to take sides in a social struggle. It is curious to note that theorists have all been perturbed by the uncertainty of ethics, and have caught glimpses, even in moments of philosophical calm, of the element of persuasion involved. They sought to avoid this by defining their terms, hoping to give greater rigour and rationality to their inquiries. Yet, ironically enough, these very definitions involved the same persuasion; and in a way that veiled and confused it, by making it appear to be purely intellectual analysis; V. The examples we have considered, whether from metaphysics, theology, epistemology, or ethics, indicate that persuasive defi- nitions are far from rare in philosophy, and that failure to recog- nise their persuasive character has been responsible for much confusion. But what, essentially, is the nature of this con- fusion ? Largely this: Blindness to persuasion has fostered a misunderstanding of the kind of disagreement that motivates many disputes; and in consequence has led people to support their contentions by far too simple a method, or to seek a definitive method of proof where none is possible.</page><page sequence="15">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 345 These methodological confusions have so far been evident only by implication, and must now be treated more explicitly. Let us proceed by indicating the actual complexity in methodology which persuasive definitions introduce; for the extent to which this complexity has been overlooked will then become obvious, without further mention. It will be convenient to confine our attention to the example of " justice "; but it must be remem- bered, of course, that the same considerations arise for any case which involves a term that is subject to persuasive definition. The summary of methodology will be parallel to that given in a previous paper.' The pattern of analysis there exemplified by " good ", however, is slightly difierent from the one here exemplified by c" justice ". The same methodological considera- tions reappear, but we must recognise them in their new guise, and amid additional complications. Two men disagree about whether a certain law is just. Let us examine the several forms which their argument may take. (1) Suppose that both men use " just " with the same con- ceptual meaning, namely: leading to consequences A and B. The argument may then be resolved by use of the empirical method. The disputants have only to see whether the law in question leads to these consequences. This simple case is seldom found, however. We have seen that " justice " is constantly subject to persuasive definition, with the result that different people come to use it in different senses. (2) Suppose, then, that the first man uses " just " to refer to A and B, and the second man uses it to refer to B and C. Sup- pose further that B is the only point of disagreement. In this case the disputants will probably proceed without noticing the discrepancy in their terminology, and will again find the em- pirical method adequate. The outcome of the argument will depend upon whether the law is or is not found to lead to B. (3) Let us next make the same supposition as immediately above, save that C, rather than B, is the sole point of disagreement. The discrepancy in terminology will then probably be realised. Yet the argument may proceed, and in some cases may be settled empirically. If the second man, who uses " just " to refer to B and C, is the one who denies the justice of the law, his opponent may refute him by showing empirically that the law does lead to C. (B is already agreed upon, by hypothesis.)

This case raises a point which demands particular attention. The first disputant did not refer to C, in his initial statement, and the second disputant denied the justice of the law on account of C alone. Hence the initial statement of the first man was at no time contradicted by his opponent. Yet the first man will feel, even after the discrepancy in terminology is clearly realised, that he has been opposed from the very beginning. He will feel the need of refuting his opponent's statement, as though this were necessary to support his own. Why is this the case ? This question seems puzzling only because we have attended exclusively to conceptual meaning. We have been tacitly as- suming that the disputants were pure scientists, motivated by a detached curiosity. If our example is to be typical of the majority of actual ones, this assumption is wholly unwarranted. The use of " just " and " unjust " clearly indicated that one disputant wasfor the law, and the other against it. They argued for this reason, not because they were statistically minded. They were disagreeing in interest. Each had a different kind of interest in the law, and neither was content to let the other's interest remain unchanged.' This kind of disagreement is evident more from emotive meaning than from conceptual mean- ing. The fact, then, that the conceptual meaning of the first disputant was not contradicted did not lead him to feel that his position was unchallenged. He wanted his opponent not merely to acknowledge certain consequences of the law, but likewise to praise it; and his opponent would not be praising it if he called it " unjust ", no matter what conceptual meaning he assigned to the term. The disagreement in interest is most easily seen in cases like (3), but a moment's consideration will show that it is equally present in cases (1) and (2). The use of the laudatory term " just" in the earlier cases indicated that they too were concerned with whether or not the law was to be favoured. A, B, and C were involved, of course, but no more so than in the third case, and they were relevant for the same reason-relevant because the disagreement in interest, which motivated the argument, was rooted in a disagreement in belief. In other words, the dis- putants would have the same kind of interest in the law if only they resolved their opposing beliefs about these consequences of it. In the first cases these opposing beliefs were about conse- 1 For a fuller analysis of disagreement in interest, see MIND, vol. xlvi, N.S., No. 181, p. 27.</page><page sequence="17">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 347 quences which both disputants referred to conceptually by the word " just ". In the third case they were about something which only one referred to by " just ". This is the main point of difference between the 'cases, and it is unimportant. The disagreement was of a sort that would terminate only when both disputants had the same kind of interest in the law. Beliefs were relevant only to the extent that they redirected interests. Which beliefs did so, and whether they were expressed in the initial statements of both opponents, determined merely the complexity of the argument, and not its fundamental character. These remarks prepare us for a further case: (4) Suppose, as before, that the first man uses " just " to refer to A and B, and the second man (who denies the justice of the law) uses " just " to refer to B and C. Suppose further that both have fully established that the law does lead to A and B, and that it does not lead to C. Conceptually speaking, of course, they have as yet located no point of disagreement, nor is there the possibility, as in (3), of one man's refuting the other " even according to the opponent's faulty conception of justice ". Yet they may still argue about the justice of the law. The laudatory force of " just ", and the derogatory force of " unjust ", are still indicative of a disagreement in interest. With regard to methodology this case is of particular impor- tance. It represents a disagreement which the empirical method may be wholly incapable of resolving. This will be clear if we again consider, at the expense of partial repetition, why the empirical method was decisive in the first three cases. In each of the earlier cases the initial judgment of one disputant was false. This was guaranteed either by the law of contradiction or by explicit hypothesis. Each disputant, moreover, would have had a favourable interest in the law only so long as he believed that " just ", in his sense, was truthfully predicable of it; for otherwise he would have used the laudatory term in a different conceptual sense. For these reasons the disputants had only to look to the truth of their initial statements, and this would lead them to have the same kind of interest in the law. In short, the disagreement in interest, which was the mainspring of the argument, was rooted in a disagreement in belief-in some belief which at least one of the opponents had falsely expressed in his initial statement. The empirical method, by upsetting this belief, would likewise resolve the disagreement in interest. In case (4), however, the initial statements of the opponents are both true. The men are disposed, as above, to favour or</page><page sequence="18">348 CHARLES LESLIE STEVENSON: disfavour the law in accordance with whether " just " and," un- just ", in the disparate senses which they employ, are truthfully predicable of it; but an empirical inquiry will serve ,to support both of their statements. Hence the first man will continue to call the law " just ", with favour; and the second " unjust ", with disfavour. Their disagreement is not rooted in some belief which either is expressing, and may be due solely to their different temperaments. Since the empirical method alters interests only through altering beliefs, how can it be used to resolve this disagreement ? It is immediately clear that the empirical method has not the same direct application, in (4), that it had in the earlier cases. Yet we shall conclude too hastily if we say that there is no room for it here at all. Let us examine further. If case (4) continues to be disputed, persuasive definitions, which hitherto have been responsible only for the ambiguity of " just ", will come to play a more overt and important role. Each man, in order to influence the other's interests, will insist upon his own definition. They will argue about whether the law is just in the true sense of " just ". Until they agree upon the sense of the word they will not agree upon their fundamental issue, namely: whether the law is to be described by a name that indicates their praise. The empirical method, however unavailing it may be in alter- ing the truth of the conceptual predications which the disputants first made, may reappear as a means of supporting their persuasive definitions. The second disputant, for instance, may be led to discover that C, to which he refers by " just ", has the further consequences, F, G, and H. If he has an unfavourable interest in these consequences, he may no longer wish to define " just " in terms of C. If he is led to discover that A has the further consequences I, J, and K, in which he has a favourable interest, he may decide to use " just " to refer to A. In other words, he may accept the definition upon which his opponent has been insisting. Both men will then come to agree that the law is just in a mutually accepted sense of "just ". This sense will be a product of their wider empirical knowledge, and it will terminate their argument not merely because they both believe that it is trulthfully predicable, of the law, but because their mutual ac- ceptance of it indicates that they no longer disagree in interest, but both favour the law. The argument in case (4) may be resolved, then, in an empirical fashion; but we must remember that it also may not. Even if the disputants know all the relevant consequences of the law,</page><page sequence="19">PERSUASIVE DEFINITIONS. 349 one of them may still wish to praise it, and the other to condemn it. They will be led to no common conceptual sense of " just ", and although neither man need be stating anything false about the law, they will continue to disagree about its justice'. The disagreement will be one in interest, not rooted in any sort of disagreement in belief. If resolved at all it will be resolved only by exhortation. It is a general truth that the empirical method can resolve ethical disagreement, or any other kind of disagreement in in- terest, only when this is rooted in a disagreement in belief. The present outline of methodology has become complicated only with regard to which beliefs are at the root of the disagree- ment in interest-whether there are any, and if so, to what extent they are expressed in the initial judgments. Such con- siderations are essential in clarifying the nature of the argument, but they are of no additional importance. This is obvious from the fact that arguments of this sort spring from the emotive meaning of the initial judgments, more than from the conceptual meaning. It is evident from a further consideration: In actual practice " just " is used so vaguely that neither disputant will be sure which consequences are included in the definition of " just ", and which psychologically guide him to make this definition. The present pattern of analysis is conveniently applicable to all of the more specific ethical terms, and likewise to "beautiful ". The pattern of analysis exemplified elsewhere by "good" 1 is conveniently applicable only to the more generic ethical terms. (It does not provide any ready means of indicating differentiae.) But which of these patterns of analysis we select for any ethical term is largely a matter of technical convenience. "Just" could perhaps be treated after the manner of " good ", and distinguished from " good " by the kind of interest involved- though present psychological terminology does not provide a means of making the distinction accurately. "Good " could doubtless be treated after the manner of " just ". Moritz Schlick made a beginning of this,2 but his failure to stress disagreement in interest, and all that it implies, largely vitiates his account. The same may be said, although with several qualifications, of the original account given by Ogden and Richards,3 and of the account given by C. D.

The ethical terms are used so vaguely that many different patterns of analysis are relevant to the conventional usage. It is idle to select some one of these as the pattern of analysis. All that is required is that the analysis clarify, whether in one way or another, the essential features of ethical arguments. These are emotive meaning, dynamic usage, disagreement in interest, and an important but not definitive role for the em- pirical method.</page></plain_text>
