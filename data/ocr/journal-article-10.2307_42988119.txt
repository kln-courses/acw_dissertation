PHYSICAL SCIENCE: A Dynamic Approach Robert T. Dixon - Riverside City College, California Reveals the spirit of the physical sciences and interweaves the history and philosophy of the various disciplines, without trying to teach the total content of physics, chemistry, astronomy, and geology. The text is selective in discussing key concepts. This provides a natural flow of ideas and conveys the spirit of science to students with little or no math or science background. Emphasis is placed on the verbalization of concepts prior to expressing them mathematically. Contains the latest information and illustrations (the text was even updated during produc- tion). Examples include discussion of the rings of Uranus, the moon of Pluto, and photo- graphs from the latest Viking probe of Mars. Exercises are selected to emphasize key points and to support the natural 'flow" from one idea to another. A comprehensive Teacher's Manual is also available. 1979 528 pp. (est.) Cloth $15.95 PHYSICS WITHOUT MATH: A Descriptive Introduction to Modern Physics Gilbert Shapiro - University of California, Berkeley Text is designed to acquaint non-science students with the scope, power and beauty of physics without solving problems. Using verbal explanations and qualitative reasoning, this one-semester, or one-quarter text explains how scientists operate, and what they can and can't do. Attempts to establish a lasting appreciation of the power and limits of science with the student who may never take another science course. Students gain an insight into how scientific explanations arise, are modified and are accepted - by means of fascinating historical examples. The latest frontiers of modern research are also reviewed to establish relevancy and motivate further study. Text uses simple language, short sentences, and a completely non-mathematical approach.
