<plain_text><page sequence="1">DARWIN, NATURAL THEOLOGY, AND SLAVERY: A JUSTIFICATION OF BROWNINGS CALIBAN BY JONATHAN LOESBERG If I were a lawyer and Robert Brownings Caliban were not fictional, I would advise him to sue for libel. Because he recognizes the presence of unjustifiable suffering in his world?even if only his own suffering? he posits a deity whose motives for creation could explain the presence ofthat suffering. And his critics therefore accuse him of projecting his own motives of selfishness, envy, and spite onto the god he creates.1 Recognizing his own state of enslavement, he responds with somewhat less than cheery goodwill. And so his critics depict him as subhuman, infantile or simply paranoid and disposed toward violence.2 The prob lem with this stance is its assumption that the purpose of the poem is to corroborate by indirection Brownings religious beliefs about the necessity of accepting the Christian revelation of a god of love. By this criterion, Caliban s theology must certainly be found wanting. But I do not think the poem has any direct reference to Browning s Christianity nor does it mean to measure Caliban by the adequacy of his cosmogony. Instead, I point to the two seemingly separate issues in the poem that this inquiry into Caliban s cosmogony brings together: first, the absolute adequacy of Caliban s natural theology as a response to William Paley and Bishop Joseph Butler in the wake of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, and, second, the poem's revelation of the effects of Caliban s enslavement, a fact overlooked by most critics, on his sense of his own choices. The reader is thus confronted with the problem of whether to read Setebos as an actual god Caliban posits or as a way of talking about Prosper. The contradiction between Caliban's motive for his meditation on the nature of god?to vex Setebos?and the lesson he draws from it?to keep a low profile?as well as the poem's conflicting pictures of the range of Setebos's power both indicate and derive from this problem. In depicting a god as a slave-master, while wondering whether his actual slave-master has a special connection to god, Caliban wonders about his choices as a slave. Not ambiguity nor irony but a doubleness of meaning has become one of the key claims about what constitutes Victorian poetry in general and Browning's dramatic monologues in particular. Isobel Armstrong's ELH 75 (2008) 871-897 ? 2008 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 871</page><page sequence="2">stunning Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Poetics and Politics offers at once the most general and the most trenchant definition of this double ness. Starting with a reading of "Love Among the Ruins" as both the expression of a myth of passion and an analysis of that myth, she sees Victorian poetry as simultaneously a lyric expression and an analysis of that expression.3 With regard to Browning, she specifies that "[i]f the dramatic text requires the reader to formulate a problem beyond the limits of the speaker, the text hands back the unfinished problem of redefinition to the reader with its circularity understood, but with the possibility of an enriched understanding of what the problem is."4 In the case of "Caliban," one may describe the simultaneous expres sion and analysis in this way: as an explanation of the way his world works, the god Caliban posits is impressively comprehensive and in every way more apt not only to the world the poem depicts but to the world Darwin presented to the Victorians than the god of love Caliban's critics fault him for not recognizing. The problem is imagining actually believing in a deity like Setebos. While critics of natural theology, as we will see, have contended that it would allow capricious deities, the point of such arguments was to cast doubt on natural theology's claim to offer an empirical and reasoned argument for the existence of a meaningful deity and not to propose a positive argument for a new form of Cartesian evil genius. Caliban's assent to Setebos becomes comprehensible when we recognize that Setebos does not result from Caliban's self-projections but from his attempt to chart the best way to live in his condition as Prospers slave (the Victorian response to Caliban as a figure of a slave?evoking fellow-feeling as much as antagonism? was, as we will see, as frequent as the one that saw him as a missing link and, indeed, sometimes connected with it). But the simultaneous deification of Prosper and debasement of Setebos into a slave-master who may be deceived, Caliban's simultaneous rage against his posi tion and claim to be analyzing it, presents the central contradiction: can Caliban imagine a resistance that gains its justice from the same theology that disallows the possibility of that resistance? The connection between the god of natural theology in the wake of Darwin and Caliban's meditation on his own enslavement raises ques tions of power and justice that the world of natural selection?from which Caliban logically adduces his god?cannot explain. A natural theology that confronts, rather than trying to explain away, the systemic violence in nature that Darwin highlighted can easily produce a capri cious and arbitrarily violent deity. Weighing the question of whether 872 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban</page><page sequence="3">the world is in the grip of an unjust deity, or simply works as it does without justification, gives Caliban the opportunity to meditate on the status of his enslavement as natural or unjust, as a thing to be resisted or an inescapable natural condition. Moreover, as we will see, the drama of Calibans enslavement is precisely his meditation on his own position and displays the Hegelian double-consciousness of the slave, in which the slave-consciousness's mediated awareness of itself as instrumental leads to a recognition of its own awareness as independent.5 This is precisely the conflict of the dramatic text that Armstrong defines since the reader becomes aware of the significance of the fact of Caliban's consciousness in away that cannot resolve either for Caliban or for the reader its inevitable duality: an awareness of self as instrumental that leads to a recogni tion of self-awareness that must always, nevertheless, be troubled by its own origin in instrumentality. In this light, the poem becomes a model dramatic monologue since its point is not Caliban's revelation of some aspect of his consciousness (say the psychological flaws he projects onto Setebos) but the revelation of the pure significance of his coming to awareness. I. Given the poem's subtitle, "Natural Theology in the Island," critics have, of course, looked at the poem's relationship with the two theolo gians most prominently taken in the nineteenth century as exemplary of the theory, Paley and Butler. Because of the near universal belief that Caliban constructs his god from self-projection, however, they have neither adequately charted the parallels between the argument from design, most prominently articulated by Paley, and Caliban's reasoning nor the parallels between Butler's argument that the nature of the world makes probable the existence of the deity depicted by Christian revelation and Caliban's extrapolation of his god's moral qualities from the workings of the world. And though some critics refer more or less explicitly to Paley and Butler, and one even references the effect of Darwin's depiction of nature on Caliban s logic, none refer to the way in which Caliban reproduces precisely the objections of thinkers such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant to the empirical claims of natural theology and the way these objections were given new force by Darwin.6 But Paley and Butler claimed to be arguing empirically from the evidence of the world in front of them. And one can show fairly readily that Caliban reproduces their logic, with the Jonathan Loesberg 873</page><page sequence="4">difference being largely what Darwin at least seemed to show was a more accurate description of the working of nature. If the resulting deity, Setebos, is not one that commands assent, the fault may lie less in Caliban than in the natural theology he practices. Thinking of the poem as merely a satire of natural theology might seem a narrow read ing, though given the current revival of natural theology as intelligent design, one should perhaps not write off too quickly the critique in this poetic embodiment of its consequences: Setebos is a far more telling satire of the current intellectual pretences of intelligent design, than, for instance, the Flying Spaghetti Monster. But further, by seeing the strength of Caliban s theology as a description of the terms of his world, we can further see why he credits the existence of such a deity and the connection between his theology and his thinking about his state of enslavement. Most critics who deal with the issue rightly accuse natural theology of anthropomorphism, depicting god in terms of human features, but they miss the way that anthropomorphism works, taking it for a projec tion onto god of the features of the individual speaker rather than a judgment of the workings of god according to the general features of human intelligence. To see the anthropomorphism of natural theology, we may start with Paley s most famous argument. Comparing a watch to a stone, he argues that we know from the features of a watch that it has been intentionally designed by an intelligence to achieve a distinct end, telling time: "when we come to inspect the watch, we perceive . . . that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose, e.g. that they are so formed and adjusted as to produce motion, and that motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day."7 In other words, the watch shows complexity of contrivance directed toward achieving a purpose and, Paley claims, these things are evidence of intelligence having been at work. Paley then turns to the mammalian eye, comparing it to a telescope. Like a watch, a telescope is a humanly designed instrument whose various features all work to achieve the end of improving vision. But as compared to the telescope, the eye not only has the same complexity directed toward the same end? vision?but in terms of its design, it is in every way superior to the telescope. If we judge watches and telescopes to be designed, then it follows that the eye must also have been designed by an intelligence. In other words, Paley looks at organic objects of complex contriv ance, compares them to objects known to be humanly contrived and argues for an identity of cause. The anthropomorphism here is not that Paley thinks he personally is intelligent and has purposes and so 874 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban"</page><page sequence="5">he projects a deity with intelligence and purpose. Rather the anthro pomorphism is already present in the claim that he can read natural objects and adduce the deity in the way we can read artificial objects and adduce the human being who made them. Nor does Paley think that this anthropomorphism is a weakness in his argument since he thinks it allows him to conclude not merely that an intelligence exists but that design proves that the deity is a personality: "[c]ontrivance, if established, appears to me to prove everything we wish to prove. Among other things, it proves the personality of the Deity . . . that which can contrive, which can design, must be a person."8 Indeed, in Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, both Cleanthes, who supports what we will anachronistically call Paley s position (since the Dialogues was written well before Paley), and Philo, who opposes it, agree that the theory is anthropomorphic, depicting a deity whose intelligence is comprehensible because it is human. Caliban, of course, does not argue for the existence of a god. Like Butler, he presumes the existence of god and he proposes to explain the features ofthat god from the world around him. Butler's aim was not to show that natural theology made revelation needless or redundant but rather that natural theology showed us that the evidence of the natural world made antecedently more likely the information Christian revelation added. He wanted to give Christianity a basis in empirical evidence. He thus starts, after a discussion of the natural evidence for immortality, with an argument that the world has all the features of a place that operates under the rules of a moral governor, not that the world will necessarily make us happy but that, in the way it appor tions pain and pleasure, it generally shows moral purpose.9 This part of Butler's argument is most relevant to Caliban s theology. But it may be pertinent to note that Butler does not think that Christian revela tion does not give us important new information regarding Christ's sacrifice for us but only that the moral government of the world makes it likely that that governor would give us additional information if we needed it and that the information offered by Christian revelation, while not indicated by the world, was fully in accord with the moral world we live in. So while Browning, who was skeptical that there was any strong historical or natural evidence for the Incarnation, had a number of reasons to find both Butler and Paley wanting, their denial of the centrality of revelation's depiction of an anthropomorphically good and loving god was not one of them.10 Consequently, in positing a harsh god, Caliban may be satirizing what Browning thinks should have been the conclusions of natural theology given its methods, but Jonathan Loesberg 875</page><page sequence="6">he cannot have been meant to satirize the picture of the deity Paley and Butler thought they could offer from empirical evidence. Because Caliban does not argue for the existence of god but pur ports to explain by analogy god's motives for creation, and because, in contrast to Paley and Butler, the explicit logic of his analogies always begins by positing his own motivation rather than beginning with any element in nature and extrapolating the kind of deity who would create that, the poem seems to offer grounds for explaining Caliban s theology as an externalized projection of his own motives and impulses. But in following Caliban too literally, we miss the Darwinian context in which he reproduces classic objections to Paley and Butler. Once we see that context, we can also see the way in which what look like projections of his own motives are actually phenomenological claims about human beings selected to explain the pain and suffering he sees in the world. It is, of course, a truism of intellectual history that Darwin changed the Victorian view of nature, damaging the argument from design more by questioning what kind of deity would design such an insidious system than by offering an alternative explanation for design. But it is a truism oddly absent in Browning criticism.11 And so it may not be amiss to start with a quotation from a letter from Darwin to Asa Gray on his view of design: But I own I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I slid, wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the bodies of living caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice.12 Darwin cites system and design of a sort here. Ichneumonidae and caterpillars form a working ecology. But the god one would extrapo late, if one were to guess who would design such an ecology, would certainly not be a Christian one. Darwin's most recent biographer speculates on the effects of Darwinism on Browning: "Many of Brown ing's realignments of faith during this period came out in his 'Caliban Upon Setebos' ... in which God constructed the world merely as a plaything, devoid of any meaning."13 This may not be a particularly accurate interpretation of the poem, much less of Browning's religious views, but it is the view of how the poem's god might be a reflection of Darwin as much as of Caliban. While Caliban frequently seems to explain Setebos's violence in relation to his own motivation, in the Darwinian context, we can see 876 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban"</page><page sequence="7">the way in which the method of his arguments, if not their conclusions, accords more nearly with Paley s and Butler's empiricism: His dam held that the Quiet made all things Which Setebos vexed only: 'holds not so, Who made them weak, meant weakness He might vex. Had he meant other while His hand was in, Why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick, Or plate my scalp with bone against the snow, Or overscale my flesh 'neath joint and joint, Like an ores armour? Ay, ?so spoil his Sport!14 Caliban's mother answered the problem of pain and suffering with a common Christian alibi: the devil did it. But like Paley, Caliban insists on reading the world as telling us about the intelligence who designed it. And his logic follows Paley s: if Setebos made weakness, he intended weakness, he designed it. And attributing to the deity the motive of wanting to vex his creatures for sport explains weakness more directly than the various rationalizations offered by apologists for natural theol ogy. Unlike those apologists, Caliban is not hampered by an a priori need to justify a benevolent deity and so extrapolates directly from weakness a designer who intended the weakness to be there. From this perspective, one can reformulate much of the logic of Calibans meditation, to show him hypothesizing rather than acting violently and attributing his violence to Setebos. Let us start with his drinking pumpkin hooch and tormenting his clay bird: "Were this no pleasure, lying in the thyme / Drinking the mash, with brain become alive, / Making and marring clay at will? So He" (96-98). Since we know that Caliban cannot animate a clay bird and, despite the claims of some critics, Caliban probably does not get drunk since fermenta tion generally doesn't occur instantaneously, we need to ask: what is he trying to explain to himself in this scene?15 Since he is not judging by what he in fact does, or is even capable of doing, what evidence does he have that Setebos does in fact make and mar at will? What Caliban imagines doing to the bird breaks the laws of nature, but a version of what he imagines occurring to the bird occurs regularly to human beings in pain: ... if his leg snapped, brittle clay, And he lay stupid-like,?why I should laugh; And if he spying me, should fall to weep, Beseech me to be good, repair his wrong, Bid his poor leg smart less or grow again, Jonathan Loesberg 877</page><page sequence="8">Well, as the chance were, this might take or else Not take my fancy[.] (85-91) Caliban has certainly never seen Setebos laughing at his pain or seen a damaged animal grow a new leg. But human beings in pain have asked their deities for aid, as in all probability has he, and the results are notoriously variable. A relaxing deity who relates to his creations as merely creations and not as other inherently valuable lives could well act capriciously out of pleasure. Caliban can imagine a human being enjoying making and marring in such a situation (he asks, rhetorically, "were this no pleasure?" expecting, and at least to an extent rightly expecting, a general assent) and explains the seeming capriciousness of natural events accordingly. Caliban's thinking becomes far easier to understand in many of these cases where he imagines doing something pointlessly cruel if we imagine him trying to account for something he sees in the external world. He may well let twenty crabs pass and stone the twenty-first. But, if we guess that he has seen one animal from among many die for no evident reason, we might imagine him confronting the seemingly random, inexplicable death, the recognition of which led to Darwin's nature replacing Paley s. (None of what I am saying should be taken to show that Caliban does not experience anger, envy, and spite and is really a sensitive, loving soul, just that there is a logic to his specu lation far more telling than random projection.) Giving a deity the characteristics of Setebos is, in this Darwinian context, a perfectly good guess at what kind of deity might cause, or even merely allow, such an event. In this context, Calibans claim that "Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him, / Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord" (98-99) makes perfect sense, at least as a description of nature. Indeed it echoes Matthew Arnold's declaration in "In Harmony With Nature" that human beings cannot "be like Nature strong, like Nature cool."16 Whether or not Caliban stones a crab, he explains to himself the mystery of one crab dying rather than another by supposing a god who acts capriciously out of strength, without fellow feeling. And many Victorians agreed with Caliban that such a god better explained the random violence of nature than a benevolent deity. Finally, although Caliban certainly does not seem to hypothesize for Setebos any motive he feels himself incapable of, one can see him searching in himself for different motives to fit the different problems of explaining different natural manifestations. For instance, he starts, at one point, by claiming that Setebos only creates what profits him 878 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban</page><page sequence="9">because that is, after all, a standard human motivation for doing things. And certainly that is how he, Caliban, acts: "'Gets no good otherwise" (181). But he finds that this motive will not do for Setebos because it depicts him as reacting to a higher force in the manner of the sea beast Caliban keeps as a pet whereas, as a deity, Setebos cannot be thought to act in this way. Nor can his creations be explained in any obvious way as profiting him. So Caliban projects another motive to explain random creativeness: Also it pleaseth Setebos to work, Use all His hands, and exercise much craft, By no means for the love of what is worked. Tasteth, himself, no finer good i' the world When all goes right, in this safe summer-time, And he wants little, hungers, aches not much, Than trying what to do with wit and strength. (185-91) Caliban here describes himself as having an intrinsic pleasure in work, an aesthetic satisfaction in the task with a Kantian indifference to the thing produced, so he evidently has more features than the negative ones critics target. But, more importantly, he asserts this aspect of himself not because he is really an artist at heart but because only such a motive explains again why Setebos might create and destroy for no obvious reason. He no more projects his aestheticism onto Setebos than he projects his spite. He tries to explain why Setebos creates the nature he sees by imagining what kinds of human motivations would produce such acts. He is doing what Paley and Butler did before him: hypothesizing what kind of human intention accounts for the kind of creation he sees. In the way the results of his empirical inductions and a priori de ductions differ from those of Paley and Butler, Caliban not only reacts to a more obviously Darwinian world, he also reflects the attacks of Kant and Hume on the argument from design (though probably not by Browning's design since I know of no evidence that he had read either). These attacks are of two kinds. First, Kant in his classic for mulation notes that the argument from design can only prove a limited figure who works instrumentally, not an absolute deity who created ex nihilo. And second, Hume argued that once one treats the deity as having a human intelligence, one is forced to question, as Caliban does, not merely how design occurs but what kind of intention or failure led to awkward designs and failures of design, and the result of such suppositions look very much like Setebos. Let us start with Jonathan Loesberg 879</page><page sequence="10">Kant's highly abstract formulation since, as we will see, the ostensibly primitive and animalistic Caliban comes very close to reproducing it. In The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues: On this method of argument [the argument from design], the purposiveness and harmonious adaptation of so much in nature can suffice to prove the contingency of the form merely, not of the matter, that is, not of the substance of the world. To prove the latter we should have to demonstrate that the things in the world would not of themselves be capable of such order and harmony, in accordance with universal laws, if they were not in their substance the produce of supreme wisdom. But to prove this we should require quite other grounds of proof than those which are derived from the analogy with human art. The utmost, therefore, that the argument can prove is an architect of the world who is always very much hampered by the adaptability of the material in which he works, not a creator of the world to whose idea everything is subject. This, however, is inadequate to the lofty purpose which we have before our eyes, namely the proof of an all-sufficient primordial being.17 Although less clearly than he might, Kant attacks the very center of Paley s argument: what does the appearance of contrivance in purpose serving organisms indicate? Since one can only contrive with matter that is already at hand, it cannot prove the creation of all matter but only a secondary creation using existing matter. Thus the forms of things may be contingent, but the primary creation of substance can bear no analogy to human art. Consequently, the argument from design can prove a demiurge circumventing resistance with contrivance, an architect. But it cannot prove a primary creator. We should also note that Kant thinks that this argument ends the matter since no one would be satisfied with proving the existence of a limited entity differing from the human in force but not in kind, and we will have to wonder why Caliban does not follow Kant in this argument, but that will be for a later moment in my argument. There has been considerable discussion of why, in the middle of his meditation on Setebos, Caliban introduces a new deity, the Quiet, and of what kind of god the Quiet is meant to represent, whether an ap proximation of a higher, better deity than Setebos or an approximation of what Browning thinks of as the God of power, to which he contrasts the more anthropomorphic God of love. Given Calibans declared in difference to the Quiet, though, it is worth considering the logic that drives him to posit this second deity. He starts by asking why Setebos is rough and ill at ease and considers who might have made him that 880 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban"</page><page sequence="11">way. But he does not, as he does with Setebos's creations, judge the Quiet by what it has made: There may be something quiet o'er His head, Out of his reach, that feels nor joy nor grief, Since both derive from weakness in some way. I joy because the quails come; would not joy Could I bring quails here when I have a mind: This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth. (133-38) Not having been schooled in metaphysical terminology, Caliban does not, as Kant does, distinguish between substance and form and deter mine to which element contingency belongs. But his contrast between obstructed wishes and their connection to emotion and the impassiv ity that must lie behind unobstructed wishes achieves the same end. He notes that it is a condition of an absolute ability, of omnipotence, that one cannot judge what it does in terms of what it might want to achieve or might want to avoid. Those forms of grief, desire, and intention can only exist when one might fail at one's end and has to contrive to achieve it. Consequently, Caliban recognizes that he has not really explained where his world comes from. But unlike Kant, he sees that question of ultimate origin out of nothing as precisely the one in which has no interest: "'Careth but for Setebos" (141). If Kant objects to natural theology on rather abstract principles, Hume, through what Kant condemns as "far-fetched subtleties so elaborately thought out," in proposing deities that accord with the bare evidence of design, and better accord with their imperfections than do the conclusion of a unitary, moral designer, shows a fertility of imagination that rivals Caliban's.18 Early in the dialogues, Philo (the skeptical voice) notes that the anthropomorphic analogy by which one evaluates natural coherences as being like the designs of human intel ligence does not preclude a number of unsettling conclusions about the nature of that designer: This world for aught he knows, is very faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior standard, and was only the first rude essay of some infant deity who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his lame performance; it is the work only of some dependent, inferior deity and is the object of derision to his superiors; it is the production of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity, and ever since his death has run on at adventures, from the first impulses and active force which it receives from him.19 Jonathan Loesberg 881</page><page sequence="12">At this point in the Dialogues, Hume merely wants to produce alterna tive hypotheses that fit the state of the empirical evidence as well as, if not better than, the hypothesis of a unitary, benevolent entity. Still, all these hypotheses share with Caliban's the explanation of imperfec tion by attributing design to a force with human-like weaknesses and motivations. When Hume explicitly asks how one would extrapolate from the evidence of the world if one dealt with the imperfections in its de sign?both the pain and suffering among all forms of life and the simple awkwardness of some of the contrivances for the ends they produce?he gets us much closer to Caliban's Setebos. Philo starts by disallowing a presumption that the deity is benevolent. Nor will he capitulate to the claim that human beings may not understand what greater end the deity has in allowing pain and imperfection. That conclusion, he argues, may be correct but it is not a direct argument from inference, which is what natural theology claims to be. It explains the evidence by arguing why it may not counter one s conclusion rather than draw ing a conclusion directly from the evidence: "Did I show you a house or palace where there was not one apartment convenient or agree able, where the windows, doors, fires, passages, stairs, and the whole economy of the building were the source of noise, confusion, fatigue, darkness, and the extremes of heat and cold, you would certainly blame the contrivance, without any further examination. ... If you find in conveniences and deformities in the building, you will always, without entering into any detail, condemn the architect."20 Caliban follows Philo s logic quite directly. He extrapolates a designer who accounts for the kinds of things he sees in his world. But?and this is where the Darwinian world of natural selection has intervened?he does not merely see a world that has some pain and random imperfection mixed in with evidence of highly effective design and some evidence of moral governance, ? la Butler. He sees a world that, while it might have been created by an entity who is "good i' the main" (109), has also been marked by inexplicable and capricious suffering and unjust hierarchies of power: one crab that has died unaccountably while others have not (again, not one that he has stoned, but one that Setebos has stoned), a broken-legged bird, a Prosper who lives at ease and takes noon siestas while intending Caliban to "drudge at his task" (21). The deity he creates, Setebos, does not merely accord with this world. It accounts for it. He cares only for Setebos, because accounting for his world is part of what he means to do.21 882 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban</page><page sequence="13">The similarities between Caliban's theology and those offered by Kant and Hume as critiques of natural theology do not matter as an indication that Browning read these authors (the similarities could have arisen from the essential strength of Hume's and Kant's and thus Caliban's logic about what one should construe from the evidence of the world). Rather, in the light of these similarities, the key difference between Caliban and those two philosophers delineates the problem at the heart of the poem. Kant means merely to show that the classic proofs for the existence of an ultimate deity are insufficient and dog matic. Hume surely means to suggest a more thoroughgoing skepticism, though the argument from design is the only target of the Dialogues. In any case, the limited deities they propose, the second-order architects, incompetent infants, and superannuated maladroits, are not offered to us for our assent but to get us to give up natural theology because it leads to such unacceptable conclusions. But Caliban posits an actual deity, Setebos, rather than positing an hypothesis to undercut belief, and I doubt that any reader follows him in thinking Setebos a better explanation for the state of the world than Humean skepticism, Dar winian doubt, or Hardyean atheism (the usual ends of arguments that take the course of Caliban's). And although one can imagine Thomas Hardy imagining Caliban as a poetic embodiment of his critique on those who believe in "Nature's Holy Plan," such a speculation does not really lead naturally to a desire for the anthropomorphic god of love that readers want Browning to be arguing for here.22 And neither a Hardyean argument nor the one usually attributed to Browning gets anywhere near to the question of why anyone would believe in such a god. Imagining Caliban as sufficiently psychologically crippled or sufficiently primitive to find such a belief likely (the positions of those who see the poem as a satire and those who see it as about the theolo gies of primitive human beings) not only ignores both the sympathy he evokes and the intelligence he displays but makes the poem's purposes either obscure or aesthetically misdirected. To answer the question of why Caliban wants a Setebos rather than either accepting a world without a god or positing the existence of a god of love against the evidence of the world, one has to look not at his psyche but at the condition in which he exists and how he thinks he should deal with or perhaps improve it. Jonathan Loesberg 883</page><page sequence="14">II. I have been arguing that Caliban constructs Setebos out of the evidence of his world, and one central element of that evidence is his own condition as Prospers slave and his recognition of it. As I alluded to above, the dramatic situation of the poem occurs when Caliban escapes his responsibility to work in the noonday sun for Prosper and Miranda, who sensibly allow themselves a siesta. Thus the poem opens by reminding us of Caliban's enslavement. And when he compares Setebos's ostensible pleasure in creating representations to his own pleasure in doing so, the representation he creates of himself speaks eloquently. While he playacts at being Prosper, he casts an imprisoned beast as himself: [Keeps] Also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he snared, Blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat tame, And splits its toe-webs, and now pens the drudge In a hole o' the rock and calls him Caliban; A bitter heart that bides its time and bites. (163-67) This passage certainly provides ample fodder for those who want to point to Caliban's insensitivity, violence, and spite. And as I have said, I hardly want to contest the fact that he displays such traits. But he displays cruelty here in a rather telling context. He maims the sea beast to mime his own condition of entrapment. In attributing to the sea-beast "a bitter heart that bides its time and bites," he describes himself explicitly. If we think the sea-beast has a reason to be bitter toward Caliban, we should at least consider that Caliban might have reason to be bitter toward the Prosper who keeps him as a drudge. As the sea-beast: so Caliban. Rather than condemning Caliban, the poem sets up a scene of doubled reflection on his condition that, it seems to me, forces us, as we sympathize with the animal, to sympathize with the figure who maims it to express his condition. To connect this condi tion to my discussion of Caliban's theologizing, I will first try to give it some further verification with a short discussion of the Victorian view of the figure of Caliban, then discuss how Caliban both reflects his condition of his enslavement in his theology and how he errantly uses his theology to try to construct a way of thinking about how to escape from it. Ultimately, the contradiction in his thinking, embodied in the contradictions that occur in his simultaneous definition of Setebos as both slave master and deity, creates the final pathos of the poem. 884 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban</page><page sequence="15">There has been considerable discussion of Caliban as embodying nineteenth-century ideas about the missing link. There has been much less discussion of Caliban as a figure of enslavement, though that was at least as usual an association at the time. Construing Caliban as a Darwinian missing link may make him either a sympathetic portrait of primitive human intelligence moving in the right direction or a satire of undeveloped, animalistic materialism.23 Aside from the a priori as sumption that Caliban's theology is woefully lacking, the best evidence for his primitiveness is his famous tendency to refer to himself in the third person, thus indicating a lack of sense of self.24 The main argument against identifying Caliban as a missing link is that his theologizing, regarded not in contrast to Browning s Christianity but in the context of natural theology, does not seem primitive at all. Given the mixed evidence, Gillian Beer's conclusion that Caliban is a "non-descript," may be the safest.25 The other Victorian symbolization of Caliban as a slave is (with a couple of exceptions noted earlier) not nearly as well recognized, but its implications are much clearer. The poem may have been written after the Jamaican slave rebellion, though certainly before Governor Eyre's brutal handling of it became a Victorian controversy. And while Browning's views on slavery are, to my knowledge, not documented, it is hard to imagine that they differed from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's well-known opposition. Moreover, even the discussions of Caliban's primitiveness can quickly become discussions of his enslavement. In an attempt to show that Browning would not find missing-link depictions as sympathetic and therefore did not intend a depiction of Caliban as a missing link to be sympathetic, Terrell L. Tebbetts produces an argument that it seems to me leads to just the opposite conclusion: "in Browning's time, Caliban was a stock figure associated with figures of Africans, apes and Yahoos and was always used abusively. This context, though certainly associating Caliban with evolution, makes him a figure of satire rather than sympathy."26 As evidence for this conclusion, Teb betts cites a stunningly racist Punch cartoon in which Caliban is an American slave telling Lincoln to beat his master until he, Caliban, gets a chance. Although Tebbetts finds it hard to imagine how Victorians might have sympathized with the Caliban figure in this cartoon, I do not find such an antithetical reading of the cartoon hard to imagine at all. And neither did Victorians, inasmuch as one sees it in Daniel Deronda's response to Grandcourt s reproduction of Punch's racism: "Grandcourt held that the Jamaican negro was a beastly sort of baptist Caliban; Deronda said he had always felt a little with Caliban, who Jonathan Loesberg 885</page><page sequence="16">naturally had his own point of view and could sing a good song."2' Indeed, whether Caliban has a primitive consciousness or not, he is undeniably a slave; seeing him as a primitive human only raises the question of his enslaved state more pointedly since it asks whether the state of his consciousness might justify his enslavement, a question that Victorians at least had two minds about.28 The real reason to see the poem as concerned with Caliban's enslave ment, though, is that it resolves the questions both of what motivates his theological meditation and of why he, unlike Hume and Kant, thinks that the objections to Christian natural theology entail assenting to the existence of a capricious and whimsically cruel deity. The poem virtually works out the slave side of the famous Hegelian master-slave dialectic, as Caliban tries to determine whether his slavery is something unnatural that may be resisted or something that must be accepted as fact. He does this by thinking of Setebos both as simply a more power ful force who may be evaded or vexed, a superhuman Prosper and, at the same time, thinking of him as an omnipresent deity whose power may not be avoided, and thus as a force that may be "vexed," but one who responds so overwhelmingly to that vexation that the practice of vexing him is foolish at best. In other words, unclear about whether Prosper is a human whose enslavement of him may be resisted or whether his slavery is a condition as natural as it is undesirable and Prosper is connected to an untouchable higher force, Caliban depicts a deity who is simultaneously and contradictorily a figure one might contend with and a deity one must attempt to appease. His evidence that his consciousness is naturally free and has its own rights is his own detestation of its mediated state as structured by his relationship to Prosper but that evidence is hardly conclusive since it comes precisely from a mediated reaction and not in and of itself. He investigates this contradiction by imagining a god he both analyzes skeptically and accepts unwillingly, thus producing the doubled and self-conscious reading that, as I noted at the outset, critics find so characteristic of Victorian poetry generally and of Browning's middle and late poems in particular. The poem is about enslavement because it is about Caliban's recognition of his own consciousness, both as mediated and as independent. His ability to construct this meditation, displayed in his monologue, thus is the point of the poem. And it matters that he no more projects a slave master god than he projects a god from his own psychological flaws. He can use the contradictions and caprices he attributes to Setebos only because they convincingly explain the features of his world. A god that was not a persuasive extrapolation 886 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban</page><page sequence="17">could not work that way. But, moreover, because he is aware of him self as instrumental, his awareness must express itself in terms of the otherness of a world whose violence presses upon him. Caliban associates Setebos with his attempt to understand his con nection to Prosper from the beginning of the poem when he explains why he wants to spend a stolen lunch hour theologizing instead of napping, as Prosper and Miranda do. He states his motive clearly enough: he talks to himself about Setebos in what he thinks may be the safety of his hiding place "Because to talk about Him vexes" (17), and he quite clearly connects this motive with his pleasure in cheating Prosper and Miranda out of some required labor, "[a]nd it is good to cheat the pair" (22). Critics have not wanted to accept this motive, considering it so obviously insufficient and illogical.29 Caliban, for example, does precisely what he thinks he should not do if he wants to avoid Setebos's wrath. Instead of staying out of his way or miming enviousness, he intentionally risks angering him. And the poem s conclu sion, in which he guesses he has been discovered, indicates how risky he takes the act to be. Moreover, Setebos obviously cannot actually be vexed as long as he does not know what Caliban is thinking, and Caliban pointedly wishes to keep his theologizing secret. So the motive is self-contradictory. But it is quite coherent for a slave to want to be able to avenge himself against his master and, realizing the danger of actual resistance, to take part in an imaginary resistance in which by doing a forbidden thing covertly, he can imagine the reaction that would occur if he were discovered. Indeed, by wanting to vex, by having a motive that indicates a reactive consciousness, while also wanting to keep that motive internal, Caliban thus establishes how he constructs a self-sufficient consciousness from the wherewithal of his requirement to think of himself as merely an extension of Prospers will. If Caliban meditates to obtain the small pleasure of an imagined revenge upon his master, his depiction of Setebos's motives with regard to him indicate that at times he imagines Setebos as a very powerful overseer rather than a deity. He no more understands why Setebos treats him badly than he understand why Prosper demands that he labor in a way that Prosper clearly does not. But he has a workable explanation. Setebos treats others better than he treats Caliban because, Caliban thinks, for reasons he does not understand, Setebos must have something against him: "He hath a spite against me, that I know, / Just as He favours Prosper, who knows why?" (202-3). Moreover, Caliban expects that one can avoid Setebos's wrath first by placating him? doing what he wants?and second by not seeming too happy. These Jonathan Loesberg 887</page><page sequence="18">are odd motives to attribute to a deity but entirely understandable as an attempt to understand the mysterious ways of slave-owners who only notice their slaves to demand more work and who can attribute too much happiness to a lack of sufficient labor to occupy one's time. My point is not that Prosper actually acts this way. For all we know (if we forget his treatment of Caliban in The Tempest), he is the model benevolent slaveholder of slaveholding ideology, cheerful, kind, and less interested in Caliban's labors than in what is best for poor, be nighted Caliban. But Caliban explicitly does not see things this way, as we know by the way he represents himself in his mimed version of himself as a maimed sea-beast. And he has at least the instrinsic fact of his enslavement?whatever Prosper does, he does not consult Caliban's will in the matter?in favor of his speculations. Experienc ing himself as the target of unreasonable demands, he imagines what might motivate those demands. Because natural theology can lead to a deity who looks limited and capricious, then, Caliban can think about the significance of his being placed in an unjust subject position by considering Setebos as in the role of slave-master. If this all seems too speculative, Caliban makes the equivalence between Prosper and Setebos all but explicit: Dug up a newt He may have envied once And turned to stone, shut up inside a stone. Please Him and hinder this??What Prosper does? Aha, if He would tell me how! Not He! There is the sport; discover how or die! (214-18) Caliban attributes to Prosper not only the power to please Setebos but the knowledge to hinder death. He thinks he needs to discover not the rules by which Setebos's world works (he knows those well enough) but Prospers means of evading those rules. Just as Prosper knows the rules of Setebos's world and how to evade them, Setebos knows how Prosper operates. For Caliban, both of them have god-like powers and both of them cooperate with each other. To understand the motives of one then may be to understand the motives of the other. The ma jor difference is that since Setebos created the world, while Prosper merely has divine powers within it, by extrapolating from Prosper to Setebos, Caliban makes sense of his place in the world. It is clear then why Caliban, unlike Butler or Paley, extrapolates his god from the pain and whimsy of the world rather than from evidence of its purposive organization and then, unlike Hume, Kant, and Darwin, 888 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban</page><page sequence="19">assents to the existence of a whimsical and occasionally cruel deity. That god allows him both to understand the motives of his oppressor and explains his situation to himself. Even a godless world, though it would explain Caliban's situation, would simply abandon the question of motive. A world created by a Christian god is fairly clearly out of the question if one is to judge of god from the workings of one's world. Setebos accords not only with a Darwinian world but also with a view of that world as created by one who oppresses. The problem with Setebos as a logical construct and, finally, the problem psychologically for Caliban as well, is that he has rather contradictory features for a deity. But these contradictions also tell us about the problems Caliban faces in determining what to do in his world. Put briefly, Setebos acts both as the limited demiurge that Kant and Hume contended was all the argument from design could, at best, give evidence for, and despite Caliban's entertaining the logical necessity of a Quiet, as the omnipotent and omnipresent god of his world. On the one hand, Caliban puts clear limits on Setebos, some of them surprisingly narrow in their constraint. Following the logic by which Kant and Hume limit the accuracy of deducing a deity from the workings of the world, he insists that Setebos's power extends only over his world. He made the sun, the moon, and the natural world and what seem to Caliban its associated meteorological features: clouds, winds, meteors. But he did not make the stars and by extension was not a first cause of all things. Moreover, his power extends only over this world. Caliban insists that there is no afterlife and that Setebos's rule ends with life (though it is unclear whether this is a natural limit to his power or a limit he gives himself; Caliban describes him ambigu ously as "Saving last pain for worst?with which an end" [255], leaving unclear whether Setebos allows the end or merely must tolerate it). Most importantly, Caliban constructs Setebos as a god he can both hide from and irritate. It is absurd to fault Caliban for not creating Brownings God of love. Even David, in "Saul," has a human basis for his intuition of God as love. Nothing in Caliban's world evidences love as even a feature of it. His relationship with all other intelligences on the island is as a slave. But he is capable of imagining a distanced, all-powerful creator unlimited by anthropomorphic intelligence or desire. That god, though, neither explains the world nor his place in it. To resist his situation in the world, he must imagine a god he can also resist, at least sotto voce and behind that god's back. He must be able to hide from the god's view and think of the god, as like human Jonathan Loesberg 889</page><page sequence="20">beings in resenting attempts to understand them in a purely analytical fashion (since, of course, such an analysis gives a form of power). But an ability to vex suggests a possibility to resist. Obviously, rebel ling against Setebos would not be the wisest of courses. His power is immense: '"Saith he is terrible: watch his fears in proof / One hurricane will spoil six good month's hope" (200-1). A god who brings hurricanes at will and without regard for what he destroys and who may kill as easily as Caliban imagines himself killing crabs demands a certain prudent respect. One can hardly blame Caliban for saving his angry theologizing for stolen hours in hidden places. But, at times, Caliban implies that resistance is not merely imprudent but ontologically im possible. He insists both that the range of Setebos's power knows no earthly limits and insists on the otherness of him with regard to what he creates. Caliban does posit the ability to escape Setebos's notice. Indeed only that ability encourages his project of acting in the one way that it is most dangerous for one of Setebos's creatures to act. "You must not know his ways and play him off," Caliban insists, even as this is precisely what he means to do in this meditation (224). But despite imagining the theoretical possibility of being somewhere that might escape Setebos's notice, the poem never actually succeeds in finding such a place. Most obviously, it ends with the storm that Caliban takes as a sign of Setebos's wrath at having overheard his meditation. But Caliban also makes remarks, such as "He is the One now: only He doth all" (178), that suggest that, with regard to this world, there really are no limits to what Setebos knows or does. Even the project of irritating is ambiguous, since, as we can see in lines quoted previ ously, Caliban insists that it is pointless to attempt to judge Setebos's actions by human moral codes: "Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him, / Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord" (98-99). Arnold attributed to nature an indifference to human morality since nature, after all, has no human consciousness with which to experience moral purpose. Caliban extrapolates from natural indifference to an indifferent deity, and he explains that indifference by imagining the deity as having an ontologically other order of intelligence. Caliban, himself, has notions of justice or he would not have to set them aside in this remark. But he does not think those notions apply to a deity who is a different order of being, not merely strong, but also Lord. One wonders not merely how Caliban thought he could get away with vexing Setebos, but also why he thought Setebos would even bother to be vexed by or even remotely interested in the maunderings of a being so ontologically separate from and lesser than himself. 890 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban</page><page sequence="21">But this contradiction between seeing Setebos as a stronger but limited power and seeing Setebos as the ultimate god of the world embodies precisely the problem that Caliban is trying to work out in the course of the poem. Setebos in the poem stands in for two forces: the order of nature and the order of Prosper. Caliban understands only too well how each of these orders works. What he needs to know is whether they are the same order. We have seen how closely he as sociates the two of them. There is one pointed difference, however. Although Caliban tries to understand the workings of the world by looking into himself and speculating on which of his motives would produce what kind of effect if he were a creator, for the most part, while he would like Setebos's power and ease, he shows no particular desire to be Setebos. But he actively plays at being Prosper. While Prosper may be god-like, Caliban is unsure about whether he is a different order of being. He never explicitly accuses Prosper of injustice, but neither does he exempt him from moral principles, as he does Setebos. For Caliban, there are two orders of power, but three figures that may occupy the seat of power, and his task is to place them. The two orders are the limits of reality and his state of enslavement to Prosper. The seat of power, though, may belong to Setebos the all-powerful, Setebos who may be resisted, or Setebos as an enhanced Prosper, who may also be one or the other. If nature is what it is, capricious, cruel, but also inhuman, then Prospers enslavement becomes iden tifiably artificial and unjust. If, however, the order of reality includes within it slave-masters and slaves, then Prospers order is the natural one and there is nowhere for Caliban to turn. He will be left, as he is at the end of the poem, in fear of Setebos's storm (which, if it is the storm Prospero creates at the beginning of The Tempest, makes the situation ironic at numbers of levels), abasing himself before a force he simultaneously rails against and yet cannot see around.30 More problematically, neither the view of Setebos as limited nor the view of Setebos as absolute really answers the question of what to make of Prosper. If Setebos is limited, one can at least imagine vexing him, if not escaping his rule. But the limited Setebos is the one who looks most like Prosper, making their orders identical. If Setebos is abso lute, "like Nature strong, like Nature cool," then perhaps Prosper is merely a human power. On the other hand, whether or not the order is separate, it is not differentiable in terms of its effects on Caliban. Whether the storm is Setebos's or Prospers, it has still found Caliban out. Caliban could extricate himself from this problem by following Kant and Hume's skepticism either to Hume's atheism or, with less Jonathan Loesberg 891</page><page sequence="22">psychological verisimilitude, into Brownings anti-natural god of love. But to accept either of these paths assumes knowledge of an answer he does not have and we have no reason to expect him to have. The sympathy readers have felt for Caliban over the years, the sullen resistance to the harsh literary critical judgment of him, I think witnesses a fellow-feeling with his situation. But the sympathy has a hard time finding an explicit critical outlet because the poem resolutely refuses to answer, at least for Caliban, the question it poses for him. We have seen Armstrong note of Victorian poetry generally and Browning specifically that the poems offer competing readings that hand the reader an experience and an analysis of the experience, resulting in an understanding of the problem but no resolution of it. Caliban's two readings of his god are each of them equally an analy sis and an experience of his problem. The poem's refusal to answer Caliban's question is so complete that most readers think that a morally elevated Caliban would recognize the world as governed by a loving God, since Browning does, and that his resistance is a manifestation of psychologically flawed spite, even though this argument implicitly contends that Caliban should resign himself to his slavery as part of the natural order of things. But equally, the poem does not offer any easy way for imagining Brownings Caliban to exit from the situation. William Shakespeare's Caliban is saved by the entrance of a new world of humans and Caliban's consequent ability to see himself as finding a new master and more importantly becoming a new man. But Browning's Caliban remains in the constrained world of the Hegelian double consciousness before it is saved by sublation. He recognizes himself as having a consciousness that is his own, a standard of judg ing that is separate from any he can extrapolate either from Prosper or from Setebos, but he also recognizes the reactive and mediatory sources of his self-awareness. Let us imagine for a moment that in addition to knowing Brown ing's religious convictions?if we are sure we do?we knew him to be a racist sympathizer with the south in the U.S. Civil war, in the manner of the Punch cartoon, and a confirmed believer in there being natural slaves. This Browning would surely hold with his critics that Caliban s religious beliefs show his own psychological flaws and further that his cheating and gibing at the napping Prosper and Miranda self-evidently showed characteristics in need of the strong control of a Carlylean master. But even if all this were true of Browning, he would still be the poet whose most characteristic power is to depict the ambiguities of alternative awarenesses in full. As long as that poet remains, I would 892 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban</page><page sequence="23">argue that the reading of the poem presented here remains. It is hardly anti-intentional to suggest that it is odd to think of the Browning who insisted on writing in voices not his own as intending by animating otherness merely to bring his readers to his own beliefs, just a little more indirectly than usual. Brownings religious beliefs thus do not matter to "Caliban upon Setebos," I would argue, because Calibans religious beliefs reveal to us the full end of the poem, the problem he faces in determining the meaning of his enslavement. And that prob lem remains unresolved in the poem, whatever Brownings solution might be. Darwin's challenge to natural theology allowed Browning a way to embody that problem within a cultural crisis?nature after Darwin?that gave the meditation its force. Once the problem, in all its modes of analysis and passion, in all its inability to be resolved on any terms internal to the consciousness whose problem the poem is, exists, the reading that here exists also follows. And, with the blithe assertiveness that only concluding sentences allow, I would like to sug gest that the case is the same for most of Browning's other ostensibly religious monologues: their situations are so specifically imagined (meeting someone who has come back from death or at least has had an awareness so strange as to support that conclusion; a poet at the edge of both his own death and the death of the civilization whose glories he has significantly played a role in trying to come to terms with limits) that about the least interesting thing one would note about the speakers is that they do not share Browning's particular religious convictions. American University NOTES 1 Although there is a longstanding disagreement among critics about whether "Caliban upon Setebos" means to satirize Caliban's theologizing or means to depict Caliban as a sympathetic primitive, there is near unanimity that the god he creates is spiteful, violent, and envious because Caliban explains Setebos's motives for creation by projecting his own motives onto a deity. By far the majority of critics fall into the first camp: E. D. H. Johnson, The Alien Vision of Victorian Poetry: Sources of the Poetic Imagination in Tennyson, Browning and Arnold (Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1963), 97-98; Michael Timko, "Browning Upon Butler; or Natural Theology in the English Isle," Criticism, 7 (1965): 141-50; Arnold Sharpiro, "Brownings Psalm of Hate: 'Caliban Upon Setebos,' Psalm 50 and The Tempest," Papers on Language and Literature 8 (1972): 53-62; E.

Tebbetts, "The Question of Satire in "Caliban upon Setebos;" Victorian Poetry 22 (1984): 365-81; Lee Erickson, Robert Browning: His Poetry and His Audiences (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1984), 217-20; and Stuart Peterfreund, "Robert Browning's De coding of Natural Theology in 'Caliban upon Setebos,'" Victorian Poetry 43 (2005): 317-31. The major cases for Caliban as a sympathetic primitive groping toward god are C. R. Tracy, "'Caliban Upon Setebos;'" Studies in Philology 35 (1938): 487-99; and John Howard, "Calibans Mind," Victorian Poetry 1 (1963): 249-257. Perhaps the most sympathetic view is, famously, Robert Langbaum's in The Poetry of Experience: The Dranmtic Monologue in Modern Literary Tradition (New York: WW Norton, 1957), 206-7, but only because he thinks that the work of the poem is to give the reader the internal sense of Caliban's being. Timko, Wendell Harris ("Browning's Caliban, Plato's Cosmogony, and Bentham on Natural Religion," SBHC 3 [1975]: 95-104), and Karr see the connection between Caliban and natural theology that I will be arguing below, but they do not quite capture the logic of Paley and Butler that I argue results in Caliban's production of Setebos. 2 Gillian Beer (Forging the Missing Link: Interdisciplinary Stones [Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993], 32) and Isobel Armstrong ("Browning's 'Caliban' and Primitive Language," in Robert Browning in Contexts, ed. John Woolford [Winfield, KS: Wedgestone Press, 1988], 76-84), are the only critics I have found who recog nize that Caliban s status as Prospers slave may have something to do with the poem. Neither connects that analysis with the cosmogony Caliban develops and so their views of the situation differ from mine. Still, their shift in context has helped me in my own formulation. 3 See Armstrong, Victorian Poetry: Poetry, Poetics and Politics (New York: Routledge, 1993), 12-20. 4 Armstrong, Victorian Poetry, 299. One of the first important definitions of Brown ing s doubleness was J. Hillis Miller's contention in The Disappearance of God: Five Nineteenth-Century Writers (New York: Schocken Books, 1965) that the particularity of Browning's consciousness was its self-expression through voicing other subjectivi ties. Slinn's deconstructive argument that Browning depicts the self as multiple and fictional and Loy Martin's Marxist claim in Browning's Dramatic Monologues and the Post-Romantic Subject (Baltimore: John Hopkins Univ. Press, 1985) that the dramatic monologue, growing out of contradictions in nineteenth-century ideas of selfhood and agency, concentrates on transactions between different voices, both participate in this identification of a constitutive and sometimes contradictory doubleness in Browning. Likewise in Browning's Beginnings: The Art of Disclosure (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1980), Herbert Tucker defines the difference between early and later Browning as one involving Browning giving his characters a greater degree of "reflective self-consciousness" (195). 5 See G. W F. Hegel, The Phenomenology of Mind, trans. J. B. Baillie (New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1967), 229-40. There is no evidence that Browning read Hegel, and it seems unlikely, to say the least, that he did. But the force of Hegel's discussion of the Lord and the Bondsman renders it absolutely appropriate for discussing the phenomenological issue of free and mediated consciousness. We will see below that Caliban did not need German metaphysics to reproduce certain of its local insights. Neither did Browning. I compare the poem's analogy between slavery and a specific kind of awareness to Hegel's because it makes the form of Brownings achievement emerge more clearly. 894 A Justification of Browning's "Caliban"</page><page sequence="25">6 Timko traces the relationship of the poem to both Paley and Butler but argues that the problem with natural theology is that it leads to a utilitarian-hedonist view of the world as justified by the pleasure it produces. See Timko, 145. This is unfair to Paley, who merely argues that the general happiness of the world proves benevolent design; he does not argue that this is all there is to divinity. It is even more unfair to Butler who argues that the arrangement of the world shows that it operates morally, not merely benevolently. But it allows Timko to argue that the poem satirizes Caliban's materialist theology. Karr goes a step further in noting the pertinence of Darwin in the view of nature Caliban has, but he doesn't seem to think that that makes that view any more likely. He thinks the problem with all natural theology, Caliban's included, is that it is ultimately a projection of one's own view of the world. See Karr, 39. The most recent article, Peterfreund's, denies the relevance of Paley and Butler, defining natural theol ogy as also including any view of the world that sees human beings as connected with the animal world. Consequently, he references Bobert Chambers s Vestiges of Creation (and really Darwin, though he doesn't say so) and in effect, his article is more nearly in the tradition of those who see the poem as satirizing Caliban's animalistic nature. 'William Paley, Natural Theology: or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity Collected from the Appearances of Nature (Boston: Gould, Kendall and Lin coln, 1850), 5. Given David Hume's attack in Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion on the weakness of analogy as an argument in this case, various critics have tried to reformulate Paley to take the analogy and the resulting anthropomorphism out of it. Elliott Sober, in The Philosophy of Biology (Boulder: Westview Press, 2000), denies that Paley's argument is really an analogy. See Sober, 24-35. He argues that the analogy to the watch was merely an aid to noting the features of contrivance and purpose and thinks that Paley really meant, or ought to have meant, that the mostly likely hypothesis to account for the existence of contrivance and purpose is their having resulted from intelligence rather than accident. From the perspective of intellectual history, Neal C. Gillespie, in "Divine Design and the Industrial Revolution: William Paley s Abor tive Reform of Natural Theology" (ISIS, 2 [1990]: 214-29), argues that Paley's point is that organic features weren't just like designed things, they actually were designed things. They operated like machines because they effectively were machines. I think both of these arguments can be refuted on their own terms. To claim that the eye is a machine or is designed begs the question since machines and designed things by definition have designers. The question is whether the features we see in them that look like the features of designed things allow the connection or not. But more importantly here, for better or worse, as we will see, Paley wanted the analogy because he wanted to make an anthropomorphic conclusion. 8 Paley, 229-30. 9 See Joseph (Bishop) Butler, The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed (London: John and Paul Knapton, 1740), 46-102. ' 10 William O. Raymond, in The Infinite Moment and Other Essays in Robert Brown ing (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1965), 37-38, long ago noted that Browning was as skeptical of historical evidence of the Incarnation as any Higher Critic and tended to rest his belief, as indeed they did, on the implicit importance of the truth the story embodied. His reasons for being skeptical of Butler's argument, from this perspective, would accordingly not have been about the content of Butler's beliefs. Rather, shar ing the skepticism of Hume and later agnostics, he would have thought that Butler's grounds did not support his conclusions. Jonathan Loesberg 895</page><page sequence="26">1 ' Perhaps most noticeably, Lionel Stephenson, in his early book on Darwin's effect on Victorian poetry, Darwin Among the Poets (1932; repr., New York: Russell &amp; Rus sell, 1963), notes the changed view of nature that occurred in the wake of the Origins publication, but when discussing "Caliban" directly, he does not make this connection but rather discusses Caliban as a primitive evolutionary forebear to human beings.

But it is hard to imagine that Browning knew how natural fermentation occurs, and gave a fair description of how Caliban might induce it, but then depicted it as occurring on the instant. And second, Caliban's thought processes do not in any sense decline at this point. ,fi "In Harmony With Nature," in Poetical Works, ed.

See Shapiro; and Slinn, 87.There is nothing in Caliban's world to encourage the proposition that it has been made by a deity who is open to covenants, nor any way for him to go about imagining making one?except to the extent that offering sacrifices, which he does do, in fact already comes under this category of deal-offering gestures. More interestingly, Philip Drew, in The Poetry of Broivning: A Critical Introduction (London: Methuen, 1970), argues that the poem in fact doesn't offer any real way of construing a positive relationship with the deity and this is a flaw in it. See Drew, 54. But, as I have said, I think this is only a flaw if one thinks that the point of the poem is to lead us to a view of Browning's god rather than to an understanding of Caliban's state. 22 Thomas Hardy, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, ed. Scott Elledge (New York: Norton, 1991), 15. 23 See Tracy and Howard for the first view, and Stephenson for the second. The full est discussion of Caliban, both in Shakespeare and Browning, as a figure of a missing link dates from the Victorian period. See Daniel Wilson's Caliban: the Missing Link (London: Macmillan and Co., 1873). The book is oddly uncited in criticism of Brown ing's Caliban. I am grateful to Gillian Beer's Forging the Missing Link (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1993) for calling it to my attention. 24 One finds this interpretation in W. David Shaw, The Dialectical Temper: The Rhe torical Art of Robert Browning, (Ithaca, NY: Cornell Univ. Press, 1968), 194; Slinn, 896 A Justification of Brownings "Caliban"</page><page sequence="27">86; and, more carefully and modified, in John Woolford, "Self-Consciousness and Self Expression in Caliban and Browning," in Robert Browning in Contexts, ed. Woolford (Winfield, KS: Wedgestone Press, 1988), 86-100. Of course, Caliban does also refer to himself in the first-person; indeed, he does so about half the time, depending on how one interprets, as Woolford points out. See Woolford, 89. But the first-person references can be taken as indications of a developing consciousness. I am tempted to explain this conflict between first-person and third-person reference as manifesting Caliban's own difficulty in determining the significance of his awareness of himself as enslaved, which I discuss below. But I think this feature of the poem has evoked more thematic consideration than it deserves. Whatever it indicates about Caliban's consciousness, its main lexical effect is to distance the reader from him as somehow other (if merely to the extent that it causes difficulty interpreting in a way that reminds us of our need to decipher). That effect has perhaps made all the critiques of Caliban as a flawed projector more understandable but it also makes regular readerly sympathy with him that much more of a noticeable achievement and one that needs explaining rather than explaining away. 25 Beer, 39. 26 Tebbetts, 368. 27 George Eliot, Daniel Deronda, ed. Barbara Hardy (New York: Penguin Books, 1967), 376. 28 Both Wilson and Armstrong make the connection between Caliban's primitive ness and conceivable justifications of his slavery. See Wilson, 82; and Armstrong, "Browning's 'Caliban,'" 77. An alert reader will note that all contextual evidence for Victorian construals of Caliban as a slave?the Governor Eyre controversy, Wilson's book on Caliban as the missing link, Daniel Deronda?postdate the publication of the poem in 1864. The poem was probably written during the U.S. Civil War, and the Punch cartoon, published in 1863 could pre-date its composition, though it probably does not. The real argument that the issue of slavery matters to the poem must be its explicit presence in the poem, so explicit, I would argue that the currency of the issue in the middle and late 1860s seems naturally to pick up the poem's themes. 29 Perhaps the least likely alternative offered has been Butts s claim that Caliban engages in theology out of "selfishness" (26). Certainly Caliban exhibits selfishness at times in his theologizing, but it is hard to see what he gains for himself by theologizing. Slinn attributes his meditation to an attempt to understand his god and avoid that god's wrath. See Slinn, 85. This seems more likely and certainly an attempt at understanding his place in the world is central to the poem. But Caliban exhibits little doubt about how he thinks he should act in regard to Setebos even though, for the course of the poem, he pretty explicitly does not do what he thinks he should. 301 owe the suggestion about the storm to Armstrong, "Browning's 'Caliban,'" 84.
