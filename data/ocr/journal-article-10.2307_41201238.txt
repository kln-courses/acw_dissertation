<plain_text><page sequence="1">What's so Austrian about the Alps? Local, Transnational and Global Perspectives in Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps CHLOE PAVER University of Exeter The exhibition 'Hast du meine Alpen gesehen? Eine jüdische Beziehungsge- schichte* [Did you See My Alps? A Jewish Love Story] explores the Jewish experience of the Alps from the nineteenth century onwards.1 Its introductory text ends with a rhetorical question, 'Was ist das Jüdische daran?' [What's Jewish about all this?], leaving visitors to draw their own conclusions. The material displayed suggests complex answers: on the one hand, Jewish and non- Jewish experiences of the Alps have often been indistinguishable; on the other, Jews have, for religious, cultural and historical reasons, experienced the Alps differently from non-Jews: as a means of assimilation, for instance, or as the physical barrier between dictatorship and freedom. This essay examines a series of Austrian exhibitions (which are introduced below after some preliminary remarks) through the lens of a similar question: 'What is Austrian about the Alps?'. Given the self-evident importance of the Alps to national identity in the Alpenrepubliky2 the question is, at one level, absurd, but it articulates my observation that, of the various strands woven together in these exhibitions - local, regional, national, transnational and global - the Austrian national strand is manifestly the weakest. In saying this, I take into account that Austria may be an unspoken point of reference even where it is not explicitly mentioned. Gunda Barth-Scalmani, Hermann Kuprian and Brigitte Mazohl-Wallnig have shown that regional identity in Austria is sometimes constructed in opposition to Vienna* and 1 The exhibition was a co-operation between the Jüdisches Museum Hohenems [Jewish Museum, Hohenems] and the Jüdisches Museum Wien [Jewish Museum, Vienna]. I am grateful to Hanno Loewy at Hohenems, Monika Gärtner and Veronika Raich at the Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Helmut Schlatter at the Artenne Nenzing for discussing their exhibitions with me. 2 Nikhil Sathe points to the motif of Alpine flowers on Euro coins as evidence of the centrality of the Alps to the national self-image today. He also notes that, as early as 1945, Karl Renner had spoken of 'unsere Alpen* [our Alps] as the key to Austria's new prosperity as a tourist nation.

Recent work in Austrian museum studies helps define the particular role played by museums in this complex inter- relationship between national and sub-national (but also supra-national) identity structures. In their introduction to a volume of essays on the representation of twentieth-century Austrian history in the museum, Dirk Rupnow and Heidemarie Uhi note the dispersal of Austrian historical heritage across a wide range of national and regional museums. They see this fragmentation as one reason why attempts to create a national 'House of History' - which would be the equivalent of Germany's 'Haus der Geschichte* in Bonn - are no nearer realization after more than a decade of debate.4 In his own contribution, Rupnow attributes some of the blame to Austria's strong tradition of two types of museum, neither of them conventionally 'national*. The regional museums (Landesmuseen) of nineteenth-century foundation conceived of themselves as 'national' while largely displaying regional culture, with an emphasis on folk traditions.5 Meanwhile, museums displaying Habsburg treasures presented the dynasty's glory to the world with little reference to the Austrian people. Rupnow sums up: 'Während die Landesmuseen ihr Blickfeld territorial eng begrenzten, waren die Wiener Museen des Hofes universal ausgerichtet' [While the regional museums had a limited territorial perspective, the Viennese court museums had a universal outlook].6 A further complicating factor in this non- national museum landscape, addressed only peripherally in Rupnow's and Uhl's volume but relevant to the examples in my study, is the EU's championing of regionalism through various regional funding schemes, which help support museums and the tourist boards that promote them. A secondary aim of this article is to assess the degree to which exhibition makers are critical of the national icon 'Alps'. Contributors to the Rupnow and Uhi volume are suspicious of exhibitions that present Austria's twentieth century as a success story, bracketing out periods of fascist rule and ignoring social tensions/ Accordingly, they favour those exhibitions that take a more 3 Gunda Barth-Scalmani, Hermann J.

As the primary site of tourism, the Alps are a key part of the success story. Moreover, as I show below, celebratory narratives of Erschließung [opening up new climbing and hiking routes], Pionierarbeit [pioneering] and Erstbesteigung [the conquest of new peaks] - all versions of the paradigmatic success story - play an important role in local folk memory and self- presentation. To a degree my argument therefore shadows Rupnow s and Uhl's, doing for exhibitions about the Alps what they do for more general exhibitions about recent Austrian history, including favouring those exhibitions that criticize or ironize the narrative of success. Ultimately, however, I reject an easy division into clearly affirmative and clearly critical exhibition displays. The dichotomous model of Heimat and anti-Hdmaf discourses which, though not uncontested,8 has served literary studies well, proves less useful here. In particular, there is no equivalent in these exhibitions of Elfriede Jelinek s open contempt for Austrias 'klerikal-alpine Verlogenheit' [the mendacity of Catholic Alpine Austria]9 and for the attempt 'to forget a bothersome history [...] by cashing in profitably on the false tourist paradise erected in Austria's winter and sports Heimať.10 I argue that some exhibitions adopt multiple positions towards the Alps and that all of them are consumed within a wide spectrum of leisure experiences of Alpine culture. Two further preliminary notes are necessary. Just as Austria has, as yet, no national 'House of History', so it has no central ťMuseum of the Alps'; instead, responsibility for conserving and interpreting Alpine culture is spread across a range of institutions with differing priorities. Heimatmuseen [local history museums], often dating back to the nineteenth century, and Freilichtmuseen [open-air museums], mostly founded in the 1970s, preserve evidence of Alpine folk traditions and culture. A significant object collection relating to mountain climbing and winter sports (but also ranging widely from art to science) is conserved under the stewardship of the Österreichischer Alpenverein [Austrian Alpine Association].11 Other objects associated with the Alps - touristic posters, taxidermie mounts of Alpine fauna, and so on - are dispersed across national and regional museum departments. While a more substantial research 8 Jörg Thunecke has questioned both the practice of Anti-Heimatliteratur and the tendency of scholarship to ignore works that do not fall into the bi-partite model of Heimatliteratur and Anti-Heimatliteratur.

At its current location in Innsbruck it also has no exhibition space: the five- year lease on space at the Hofburg in Innsbruck, where the Museum is showing 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft' (analysed later in this article), is intended to address this difficulty in the short term until permanent space can be found.</page><page sequence="4">i82 Chloe Paver project would be required to investigate the full range of conserved material in the highly dispersed 'archive* of the Alps, the exhibitions visited cover a broadly representative range of object types. Permanent exhibitions were viewed at the Montafoner Heimatmuseum in Schruns, the Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn, the Alpinarium Galtür and the Landesmuseum Rudolfinum in Klagenfurt. Two long-term exhibitions visited were 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft* ['Mountains. A Mysterious Passion*] by the Alpenverein-Museum Innsbruck, showing 2007-12 at the Hofburg in Innsbruck, and 'Hast du meine Berge gesehen?* at the Jüdisches Museum Hohenems. I also saw a series of summer exhibitions: 'Sommerfrische im Himmel. Alltag und Idylle* [A Summer Retreat in "Heaven**: Between the Everyday and the Idyllic] at the Artenne Nenzing, which took as its subject a holiday village in a remote mountain valley; 'Kind und Kuh* [Child and Cow] at the Montafoner Bergbaumuseum Silbertal, which showed primitive children's toys from the collection of ethnologist Eugenie Goldstern; 'Bergbilder* [Mountain Images] at the Montafoner Heimatmuseum Schruns, which addressed the changing iconography of the mountains; 'Zwischen Valleu und Vallüla* [Between Valleu and Vallüla (two peaks climbed by hikers)] at the Montafoner Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn, a biographical exhibition about a local priest and pioneer alpinist; and, finally, 'Schnee. Rohstoff der Kunst* [Snow: Raw Material of Art], an art exhibition at the Vorarlberger Landesmuseum in Bregenz.12 Since all but one of the exhibitions were shown either in Tyrol or in Vorarlberg, inferences about national trends should be drawn with caution. I The images displayed in the exhibitions testify to the fact that the Alpine landscape militates visually against national classification: views of mountain peaks, snow scenes, mountain huts and mountaineers - of which I saw several hundred across the various exhibitions - for the most part bear no national stamp. While this same quality of neutrality facilitates the projection of national visions and fantasies onto the mountains, it remains the case that such fantasies are only rarely visible on the surface of the objects conserved for museum display. Besides, on the evidence of these exhibitions, the Alps have long been a transnational and international space. 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft', in particular, shows how artists, scientists and sportspeople from all over Europe converged on the Alps from the eighteenth century onwards.13 Other exhibitions deal with border regions, where national boundaries have been more or less permeable at different times in history. 'Hast du meine Alpen 12 Where catalogues are available, details are given at the first mention of the exhibitions below. 13 Berge, eine unverständliche Leidenschaft, ed. by Philipp Fesch, Beat Gugger and Gabriele Rath (Vienna and Bozen, 2009).</page><page sequence="5">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 183 gesehen?', for instance, tells the history of the use of the mountain passes as escape routes, not only during the National Socialist era but also during the exodus of Holocaust survivors to Mandatory Palestine in 1946-48.14 Some of the exhibitions draw more surprising arcs from the very local to the international. 'Kind und Kuh' brings children's toys produced in remote communities in the southern Swiss region of Wallis to a small mining museum in the Austrian region of Montaron. The motivation for this transposition of objects is intensely local, part of efforts by the local history society to atone for the fact that the village produced an SS guard who worked at Sobibor, where the collector of the toys (Eugenie Goldstern, a Russian-born Austrian ethnologist) is thought to have been murdered. The curators of 'Sommerfrische im Himmel' recall that families on holiday in the so-called 'Nenzinger Himmel', a tiny summer resort untouched by international tourism, used to walk to Liechtenstein in the 1950s to buy Swiss chocolate and American cigarettes; they also recount the history of the Swiss hunting association that leased land in the 'Himmel' for nearly a century. The Alpinarium Galtür has a more programmatically 'giocai' agenda: a site-specific museum, built to commemorate a fatal avalanche, it devotes equal space to the customs of the local Paznaun region and to the global geological movements that produced the Alps. Indeed, a photograph of an avalanche on Mars introduces an inter-planetary perspective. As this last example suggests, in figuring the Alps as transnational or international, the exhibitions do more than just reflect Alpine realities: curators choose this emphasis. By combining objects and stories from a variety of participating nations without comment, curators efface national divisions. In the larger exhibitions, objects produced in Austria, Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere are freely combined. Thus, one of the smaller rooms of 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft' contains a video by Swiss artist Anna Winteler, a Swiss radio recording of the first cable-car ride to the summit of Säntis, a quotation from the French geologist and botanist Louis Ramond de Carbonnières, and a page from the notebook of Italian scientist Angelo Mosso. Likewise, in a room devoted to road and rail communications in the Alps, the Alpinarium Galtür displays information on Austrian and Swiss engineering projects alongside the results of a Dutch design project that envisages a fantasy of Switzerland's future ('What might Switzerland become?'). These and other materials are arranged under thematic, but not national, headings. Finally, the snow globes that form a light-hearted entrée to 'Schnee. Rohstoff der Kunst' are a standardized Western product commodifying a hotchpotch of motifs: a bust of Mozart sits alongside a Buddha and a dolphin; a wayside cross and other Alpine scenes compete with teddy bears, penguins and the Eiffel Tower. Such internationalism is doubtless partly a function of institutional con- texts. 'Hast du meine Alpen gesehen?' is due to travel to exhibition partners in 14 Hast du meine Alpen gesehen? Eine jüdische Beziehungsgeschichte, ed. by Hanno Loewy and Gerhard Milchram (Munich, 2009).</page><page sequence="6">i84 Chloe Paver Switzerland, Germany and Italy. The Österreichischer Alpenverein co-operates closely with its German sister organization, with whom its history was largely shared until 1945, and many objects on view in 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft* are on loan from Germany. In fact, the larger exhibitions all contained loans from abroad, and even the most local of the art venues, the Artenne Nenzing, had commissioned artists from Austria, Germany and Liechtenstein to respond to its theme.15 Some institutions have benefitted from EU funding for regional or cross-border initiatives: the Landesmuseum Rudolfinum received 'Interreg ИГ funding (awarded for Austrian/Italian co-operation) to upgrade its displays about the Alps, while the organization Terra Raetica, an EU-funded consortium of Swiss, Austrian and Italian councils in the 'Rätischer Dreieck', helps promote the Alpinarium Galtür.16 The permanent exhibition at the Alpinarium was supported by the regional development association Europaregion Tirol ■- Südtirol - Trentino.17 The Alpinarium, the Artenne and the three Monatfon museums (Schruns, Gaschurn and Silbertal) have all received funding from the EtTs LEADER regional development programme. Finally, 'Schnee* received some of its funding from Pro Helvetia, presumably for the loan of Swiss artworks. Other funding comes from the Lander, meaning that support for these exhibitions rarely comes from national state coffers. II Whatever its source, the internationalism of the various exhibitions goes hand in hand with an examination of the connections between alpinism, Heimat culture and nationalism, most explicitly in 'Hast du meine Alpen gesehen?*, which tells of the 'Aryanization* of Jewish hotels and other Alpine businesses and recalls that the Alpenverein adopted the so-called 'Arierparagraph* ["'Aryans*' only* rule] as early as the 1920s, long before anti-Semitism became a state ideology. The visitor is not permitted to relegate this fact to a comfortingly distant chapter in Austria*s history because the curators link it to contemporary politics through the inclusion of two media and internet discussions:18 one concerns the belated decision of the Alpenverein (in 2002) to remove the 15 http://www.artenne.at/content/Rueckblick/2oo9/Ausstellung/A_O9_doku_tenneale_ screen.pdf (accessed 15 March 2010). http://www.culturaraetica.eu (accessed 15 March 2010). 17 http://www.europaregion.info/de/41.asp (accessed 15 March 2010). This contrasts with the 2005 exhibition Österreich ist frei*, mounted by the Lower Austrian regional government at Schallaburg castle, which has been criticized by Ulrich Felber. The exhibition makers, he argues, Sparten nahezu alle aktuellen Bezüge aus, indem sie die NS -Vergangenheit als ein abgeschlossenes historisches Phänomen erscheinen ließen' [omitted practically all points of reference to the present day by presenting the National Socialist past as a historical phenomenon that is over and done with].

Several objects, scattered around the exhibition and demanding to be discovered, bear a visible National Socialist stamp. In the section 'Packen* [Packing], which explores changing expectations of what a hiker needs to carry up the mountain, objects spaced out along a display table are labelled with their weight. Weighing in at only 8g (compared with, say, 74g for a Swiss army knife) is a badge for members of the 'HJ-Bergfahrtengruppe im Deutschen Alpenverein* [Hitler Youth Hiking Group in the German Alpine Association], whose history is related in a nearby caption. The placing of the badge is counter-intuitive, since unlike the other objects here it is hardly an essential piece of mountain 'kiť, yet despite or because of this it succeeds in provoking thought: so light an object, so loaded with political implications.20 While the efficacy of this light-touch approach might be debated (staff at the Alpenverein-Museum reported that it was more popular with school students than with teachers),21 it is certainly preferable to the 'dunkles Kapitel* [dark chapter] method characteristic of institutional chronicles; this hides the specifics of National Socialist rule and crimes behind a generalized condemnation of the era. At the Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn (opened in 1992 and therefore hardly a relic from a distant post-war past) an information board about presidents of the local chapter of the Alpenverein makes no mention of the political caesura of 1938, while its tribute to the president elected in 1939 only praises his fortitude in 'difficult times': Als 1939 der zweite Weltkrieg ausbrach, wurden die Grenzen gegen die Schweiz militärisch abgeriegelt. Für Bergsteiger war dort kein Raum. Ein breiter Streifen entlang der Hochgebirgsgrenze wurde neuerlich Niemandsland [...]. So blieb dem Obmann Walther Flaig nur mehr die Aufgabe, den großen Alpenvereinsbesitz nach Möglichkeit zu bewahren. Das war umso schwieriger, als nicht nur bald die ganze aktive Mitgliedschaft, 19 A BZÖ politician was duped by the hoax correspondence, unleashing a storm of protest from defenders of the Heimat.

[When the World War broke out in 1939, the army sealed off the border with Switzerland. There was no longer any place for mountain climbers. A wide strip along the border that runs through the high mountains was once more designated as no man's land. All that was left for the President, Walther Flaig, was to preserve the possessions of the Alpine Association as best as he could. This was made all the more difficult by the fact that soon not just the whole active membership of the local Association but also the President himself were conscripted into military service abroad.] Here, the Second World War is divorced from its basis in National Socialism and figured as a nexus of unspecific political forces which act independently of individual agency.22 Ill The topics so far discussed - regionalism, internationalism and nationalism - converge in Alpine Heimat culture. As a system of distinction separating one locality from the next, folk culture most obviously embodies the local. At the same time, it is a system common to the countries that share the Alps, expressing itself in broadly similar ways (costume, dance and customs), and it is, in addition, part of each country's brand identity overseas. Yet, in as much as Heimat culture is differently valued in different national contexts, it certainly also has a national dimension. While winter sports and Alpine tourism are in one sense at odds with traditionalist conceptualizations of the Heimat because they involve the intrusion of both strangers and modern infrastructure into the landscape, Matthias Konzett has argued, in the context of Elfriede Jelinek s cultural critique, that they constitute two important ways in which Austria rehabilitated its Heimat culture after the National Socialist era, by commodifying it for consumption by others.23 Accordingly, the next part of 22 Similar rhetorical devices are used by a 2009 tourist brochure to tell the story of the Montafon chapter of the Alpenverein: 'Durch die Wirren der beiden Weltkriege erschüttert, konnte der Verein nach einer Umstrukturierung zusammengehalten werden, die Mitgliedschaft stieg von 61 Mitgliedern im Jahre 1900 mit massiven Einbrüchen durch die Weltkriege trotzdem konstant an* [Shaken by the turmoil of the two World Wars, the Club was able to keep going after restructuring, with membership rising steadily from 61 members in 1900, albeit with significant slumps because of the world wars]. Here, the Second World War (dissociated from National Socialism through the unspecific term 'Weltkrieg') is made vaguer still through conflation with the First World War. While both wars are viewed as a setback for the Alpenverein, the causes and events of the wars - most particularly the change of regime in 1938 - disappear behind the generalized term 'Wirren* ('Alpenverein Bezirk Montafon. Engagierter Verein mit langjähriger Geschichte* in 'Tourismus Aktuell', September 2006, brochure produced by Schruns-Tschagguns Tourismus GmbH, p. 18). For similar accounts from museum chronicles see Sommer, 'Experiment und Leerstelle', pp. 319-20. 23 'The Olympic Winter Games of 1964 in Innsbruck eventually paved the way for an</page><page sequence="9">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 187 my analysis concerns the presentation of material traces of Alpine Heimat culture in the museum. Tracht [traditional folk costume] and taxidermie mounts represent traditional categories of conserved material, while narratives of mountaineering and tourism represent the modern, leisure-based Alpine Heimat. In traditional displays of Trachty as seen at the Montafoner Heimatmuseum, costumes are shown on tailor's dummies and behind glass. They are presented primarily as objects of local pride, with a focus on the expert needlework and on the transmission of attendant traditions from one generation to the next.24 The newer exhibitions that are this article's main focus steer clear of uncritical displays of Trachty partly by choosing subject matter that does not call for such stereotypical artefacts, but also by providing a critical or at least ironical context for any Tracht displayed. In 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft' the only three-dimensional piece of traditional clothing on display is a not a full costume on a tailor's dummy but a single felt hat, and this is juxtaposed with a modern helmet. Elsewhere, advertising from a turn-of-the-century Viennese clothes shop shows women developing their own equivalent to the male mountain- climber's 'uniform' of genericized Tracht. In yet another room, a photograph series shows the artist Martin Kippenberger posing on a Tyrolean peak in a strikingly incongruous suit and tie. Finally, a souvenir plate is displayed beside the exit: alongside conventional Alpine iconography (peaks, edelweiss, a cow, and a woman in Tracht) it depicts a mountain climber in modern climbing gear. The caption explains that the plate, on sale in the South Tyrolean town of Meran/Merano (with its mixed population of German speakers and Italian speakers), was made in China. At the Alpinarium Galtür full Tracht is on view, but is framed within a specially commissioned film, in which local music and dance groups, dressed in Tracht but performing against a blank background rather than in a localized setting, provide interludes in a dramatic monologue. This acknowledges darker elements of Heimat culture, such as the superstition that led to the bearded vulture, suspected of snatching children, being hunted to extinction in the Alpine region. 'Hast du meine Alpen gesehen?' prominently displays a fine, full-length photograph of ethnographer Konrad Mautner in Trachty beside a slide-show of family photographs of Trac/zi-wearers. Indeed, the exhibition entire new era in which Alpine folklore with its once problematic emphasis on Heimat was now attached to a leisure culture patterned on the democratic and capitalist principles of the Western world [...]. The ensuing development of an Alpine tourist industry brought Austria's backward economy up to date and placed it among the leading nations/ Konzett, The Rhetoric of National Dissent, p. 110. 4 The museum also displays nineteenth-century prints of Montafon Trachty some produced as far away as London or Paris, reminding us that this system of markers of distinction appealed to the classifkatory passions of the nineteenth century. This act of framing provides at least the seeds of a critical historical perspective on the costumes, but is currently unexploited.</page><page sequence="10">i88 Chloe Paver devotes much of its space to showing how, until 1938 (and even beyond), Jewish Austrians made substantial contributions to all aspects of Heimat culture: the manufacture and popularization of Tracht and Tracht dolls; ethnographic study of mountain communities; development of tourist infrastructure; the Bergfilm; and Alpine sports. Berthold Auerbach, a German- Jewish writer, is credited with making the edelweiss the Alpine symbol par excellence^ and various objects - items from the kosher Hotel Edelweiss in St Moritz, a prayer book with a pressed edelweiss between its leaves and a yarmulke with an edelweiss motif - show how Jews have readily appropriated this symbol.25 Stuffed animals (as displayed, for instance, at the Montafoner Heimatmuseum or at the AlpinMuseum in Kempten, Germany) occupy an important place in the material archive of the Alpine Heimat. In traditional taxidermie display, animals are celebrated as characteristic of the locality; the fact that they have been hunted, captured and objectified is played down. Some of the exhibitions analysed here abandon conventional naturalistic dioramas in favour of a minimalist staging of single mounted animals that call into question the dominance of human beings over the natural environment. In 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft* a stuffed bird of prey hovers above the visitor in the section 'Oben' [At the Top], reminding us that, however euphoric we feel on the summit, we were neither there first nor can we (by our own motive powers) ever rise the highest. In this way, the bird complements the photographs and text below it, which throw ironic light on the 'Gipfelposen' [Summit Poses] assumed by climbers while emphasizing how venial human beings are in their desire to claim to have been the highest or the first (resorting even to cheating). Elsewhere in 'Berge', a stuffed marmot is hidden, at children's eye- level, behind a large display structure. While in other contexts this might seem a slight and ineffectual gesture, here the effect is heightened by its contrast with locally prevailing visual conventions: at the time of writing, shoppers could acquire, from the master taxidermist's shop in a nearby street, a somewhat sentimentalized mother-and-baby ensemble of marmots for €550. A review in Der Standard of a 2006 taxidermy exhibition begins with the words 'Tote Tiere sind beliebt. Sie hängen in Wohnzimmern, Gaststuben und Museen' [Dead animals are popular. They can be seen hanging in living rooms, pubs and restaurants, and museums].26 While this may be lazy journalistic scene- setting, it is lazy scene-setting that would make little sense in the UK: compare the claim by a British scholar and artist that 'Taxidermy specimens and display have become increasingly liminal in contemporary society'.27 25 Similar displays of Jewish folk objects at southern German Jewish museums such as Fürth and Schnaittach likewise underscore the senselessness of the National Socialist construction of Jews as antithetical to the Heimat. 26 [Anon.], 'Braunbär mit Nadelstichen und rauchende Eichhörnchen', Der Standard, 21 February 2006, http://derstandard.at/2346618 (accessed 5 June 2011). 27 Merle Patchett and Kate Foster, 'Repair Work: Surfacing the Geographies of Dead Animals', Museum and Societyy 6/ii (2008), 98-122 (p. 98).</page><page sequence="11">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 189 Fig. 1. Taxidermie mount by Peter Morass. On loan from the maker to the Alpinarium Galtür. Image reproduced with permission. The Alpinarium Galtür uses taxidermie mounts rather more prominently. In a display that gauges the relative ability of humans and animals to adapt to mountain conditions, stuffed animals strike anthropomorphic poses: a marmot leans back and swings its legs like a teenager sitting on the edge of a swimming pool; a chamois goat balances on a basketball. The animals speak in the first person in the accompanying texts, while human beings are objectified, represented by two lifeless mannequins. In the final room of the Alpinarium, which asks how local traditions can be conserved in a rapidly changing world, a marmot sits in a cooking pot, holding a knife like a high priest about to perform a sacrifice; the display is hung lightly from wires, beside a recipe for roast marmot (Figure 1). The effect created is interestingly ambiguous: on the one hand the mount shows irreverence towards the traditional material culture of the Heimat; at the same time it celebrates an aspect of local culture: the seasonal hunting of marmot and its preparation according to often secret recipes, traditionally passed down from mother to daughter. This ambiguity is heightened by a</page><page sequence="12">190 Chloe Paver label identifying the taxidermist as Peter Morass. While one might imagine the taxidermist as an artisan in the local Heimat tradition (albeit an artisan with scientific training), Morass trained for many years in Japan. Conversely, one might, on the evidence of this ironic mount, consider Morass a subverter of Heimat iconography, yet he produces largely Straight' mounts for natural history displays, and the taxidermy championships in which he takes part - he is a multiple European champion - favour traditional taxidermie products.28 In an article on the meanings of taxidermy mounts in contemporary museum display, Rachel Poliquin assumes that where curators attempt to elicit a Cautionary reading* - one which emphasizes human beings* past sins against nature - they will use historical mounts or, like the Natural History Museum in London, announce that the practice of taxidermy has been discontinued out of sensitivity to the environment.29 In Austria, where an exhibition of Morass's new work has recently toured, this is evidently not the case.30 IV Conventional mountaineering narratives, as found in the chronicles of local chapters of the Alpenverein, employ a celebratory rhetoric of Erschließung and Erstbesteigung. Such narratives can still be read, for instance, in the older displays at the Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn, which record in detail the construction of each new mountain hut that opened up a new hiking route. That it is possible to update this rhetoric for the twenty-first century without substantially questioning its implications is apparent from a display at the Kärntner Landesmuseum in Klagenfurt. The museum has recently given a new lease of life to a massive plaster relief of the Grossglockner mountain and its surroundings by making it the focus of an eight-minute multi-media show. As still and moving images play over the surface, visitors hear a sound collage comprising voiceover narrative, sound effects and classical music. Without doubt, this enlivens a now outmoded nineteenth-century informational aid.31 However, of all the ideas the museum might have explored through the new 28 On Morass's titles see http://portal.wko.at/wk/format_detail.wk?angid=i&amp;:stid=263OO2 &amp;dstid=i95&amp;opennavid=33855 (accessed 15 March 2010); on the championships, see http:// www.eurotaxidermy.eu/etc_2oo6_Jongarone/ (accessed 15 March 2010). In the article 'Braunbär mit Nadelstichen', a previous example of an ironic mount is presented as an exception to Morass's normal practice. 29 Rachel Poliquin, The Matter and Meaning of Museum Taxidermy', Museum and Society, 6/ii (2008), 123-34 (p. 129). 30 An exhibition of Morass's work has toured Austria and Italy, showing first at the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien in 2005, as 'Momente der Wildnis' [Moments of Wilderness]. 31 Sommer argues ('Experiment und Leerstelle', p. 314) that such 'Technologien des Zeigens' [technologies of display], which were state of the art in their day, were typical of the Landesmuseen in the nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="13">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 191 display (the changes to the landscape since the relief was made, for instance, or the more abstract idea of the 'Projektionsfläche Alpen' [the Alps as a blank screen on to which ideas are projected]), it has chosen a conventional narrative of the Erstbesteigung of the Grossglockner. Not that it sentimentalizes the expedition - extracts from a contemporary account reveal the climbing party's superstitions and anxieties - but all hardships are ultimately overcome and, as the speaker announces the arrival at the summit, fireworks explode across the surface of the relief, accompanied by stirring Baroque organ music.32 While never denying the glories of mountaineering (it is, after all, an exhibition about a Leidenschaft' [passion]), 'Berge. Eine unverständliche Leidenschaft* is, by contrast, alive to the absurdities of our encounters with the mountains. The story is told of a Swiss parish that applied, in 1988, for permission to build a dry wall on the top of its mountain in order to return it to its status as a 'Viertausender' [four thousand-metre peak], humiliatingly forfeited when the surveyors were shown to have been several metres out in their calculations. Might it not be easier, wrote one alpinist to the mayor's office, if hikers jumped in the air on the summit to place their heads above 4000 metres? Examples are also given of Enlightenment scientists who took their passion for categorizing and cataloguing too far: the cartographer whose key was so detailed that the map was unusable and the government in Vienna sent him back to the drawing board;33 the Schlagintweit brothers, who assembled such astonishing masses of data in the Himalaya that they were unable to publish most of it, while what they did publish was considered unreadable. In a series of video interviews skiers and mountaineers talk of their love of the mountains, but Museum Studies scholar Gottfried Fliedl recalls being forced to go hiking as a child; he suggests that children's love of what is small and close at hand makes the adult preoccupation with wide views quite alien to them. While operating on a smaller scale, 'Bergbilder' at the Montafoner Heimat- museum covered some of the same ground as 'Berge. Eine unverständliche 32 The association of the Grossglockner with nationalist feelings is underlined by Helmut Qualtinger's and Carl Merz's satirical one-act monologue Der Herr Karl (1959). Karl, a staunch Austrian patriot, joins a friend on a celebratory tour of Austria after the signing of the Staatsvertrag [State Treaty], which restored Austria's sovereignty in 1955. As his friend puts it: €i mecht amai unser schönes Österreich kennenlernen - jetzt, wo's wieder uns g'heerť [I'd like to get to know our lovely Austria - now that it belongs to us again]. Karl speaks of the feeling of community among Austrian tourists at the Grossglockner, joined in wonder at the beauty of their own country. However, Qualtinger and Merz undermine his love of the mountains somewhat by making him too lazy to climb any: Helmut Qualtinger and Carl Merz, 'Der Herr Karl* in Der Herr Karl und weiteres Heiteres (Reinbek bei Hamburg, 1964; first pubi. 1959), pp. 7-31 (pp. 24-25). 33 The key to Peter Anich's Atlas Tirolensis included the following categories of settlement, amongst others: 'Weiler, kleine Dörfer, mittlere Dörfer, mittlere Dörfer zerstreut, große Dörfer, große Dörfer zerstreut, Marktflecken* [Hamlets, small villages, mid-sized villages, mid-sized villages (dispersed), large villages, large villages (dispersed), small market towns].</page><page sequence="14">192 Chloe Paver Leidenschaft', illustrating the evolution of an iconography of the Alps; it also shared some of the same mild irony. Even as it celebrated the pioneering spirit of alpinist and writer Karl Blodig, the exhibition poked gentle fun at him: Blodig's dismissal of easy climbs as 'walks for women' ('Zu einer Damentour wird der Garneraturm nicht leicht herabsinken' [The Garneraturm peak is never likely to be relegated to a women's hiking route]) is silently juxtaposed with a photograph of a woman surveying the mountains from a high peak. A similar comment by Johann Jakob Weilenmann, one of the first climbers to conquer Piz Buin ('Über das sanft geneigte Schuttfeld [...] könnte jede Dame gehen' [Even a woman could walk across the gently sloping scree]) appears near a photo of a woman walking over rocks towards a summit, evidently unhindered by a long Edwardian skirt. V Museum displays about tourism have conventionally presented a narrative of Erschließung similar to alpinism's grand narrative, though in addition to the opening of new hiking routes they stress the building of tourist infrastructure. The Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn is currently in the process of being reconceived, so that its old display, from 1992, is now partly dismantled. The remaining evidence (also documented in a museum brochure) suggests that the display was not entirely affirmative, since it addressed the environmental degradation caused by tourism.34 Nevertheless, on the whole, the display celebrated the development of a tourist infrastructure, recounting the building of the Silvretta Hochalpenstrasse and the forty-year history of the area's chair-lifts. The museum also delighted in the object world of early tourism: advertising material, old skis and sleds, and so on. Even today, a reconstructed hotel bedroom displays pristine folk furnishings; suitcases, guide books, hiking boots and other holiday paraphernalia are absent from this tableau, despite their presence in the museum's collections. There is therefore little sense of the encounter between Heimat and the visitor that constitutes the tourist transaction. This may well change. The first stage of renewal was marked by the 2009 summer exhibition 'Zwischen Valleu und Vallüla', which charted the life of a former occupant of the house, the priest Franz Josef Battlogg. While enthusiastically celebrating Battlogg's previously unsung contribution to the locality - not just his pioneering alpinism but also, less stereotypically, his establishment of a much feted choral society - the exhibition also introduced conflicts and contradictions into the museum. Battlogg was characterized as a difficult individual who fell out with those around him. In a series of extracts from his diary, Battlogg expresses his contempt for a mendacious clergy, for his 34 'Montafoner Tourismus-Museum Gaschurn', ed. by Stand Montafon (Schruns, 1992), brochure, no ISBN, unpaginated insert between pp. 6 and 7.</page><page sequence="15">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 193 bishop and for tourists. While Battlogg is at most a mildly provocative subject, this more ambivalent, less picturesque, view of the locality's past promises a new approach. Perhaps because it is a recent foundation unburdened by a collection, the Alpinarium Galtür goes further than other museums in acknowledging the modern complexities of the Alpine world. Folk objects are not kept separate from modern objects: an extraordinary hand-knitted tableau of an Alpine landscape, complete with cows, farmhouses, fir trees, ski lifts, a mountain spirit and a wayside cross, hangs between large neon graphs representing statistics about Alpine employment. Amongst other things, the museum gives space (though not, as far as I could ascertain, a first-person voice) to the Saisonniers, the low-paid, mostly migrant seasonal workers on whom the tourist industry relies, and who are under-represented in these exhibitions. The Alpinarium also treats engineering projects in their own right (with the help of models and plans) rather than placing them solely in the service of a narrative of Erschließung. Tourist experiences of a different kind were the focus of 'Sommerfrische im Himmel. Alltag und Idylle', which charted the development of the Nenzinger Himmel from a summer base for cattle farmers to a holiday village. Situated at the end of a toll road through a narrow valley, this small pocket of habitation is virtually cut off from the busy Montaron holiday region of which it forms a part; thanks to strict planning rules and restrictions on day visitors it has retained its peace and exclusivity. The subject of the Nenzinger Himmel is therefore ripe for nostalgic representation, although, significantly, such nostalgia would not be for an intact Alpine lifestyle, which was already long gone from the Himmel by the early twentieth century, but for a purer form of tourism, free of commercialism, globalization, large-scale engineering works and noise. In the event, the exhibition succeeded in expressing the affection inspired by this unique mountain enclave without exhausting itself in cosy celebration. What gave the exhibition an atypical perspective was the fact that the local community of Nenzing - which supplied most of the display material - is both host and guest at the 'Himmď (since many Nenzing families own chalets or go walking there). This allowed an exploration of the ways in which a community consumes its own Alpine surroundings for leisure purposes. Holiday snaps showed family groups playing or resting near the chalets and going for walks in everyday clothing; very few showed earnest hikers or climbers. This intimate, unspectacular imagery, coupled with a focus on the work needed to renovate the chalets and maintain the toll road, left an impression of an everyday, unheroic alpinism, far from the vainglorious narratives of conquest and construction, and far from the iconography oí Gipfelposen that together form the stuff of local Alpenverein histories (and which retain a certain power even in exhibitions that ironize them).</page><page sequence="16">194 Chloe Paver VI It is not my contention that all exhibition displays about the Alps can, or should, be divided into those that celebrate the mountains as a conflict-free realm of beauty and tradition (and are therefore to be condemned) and those that identify conflicts and fault-lines in the Alpine world (and are therefore to be praised). As the examples discussed here have shown, an exhibition can simultaneously celebrate and question the Alps. The Tourismusmuseum Gaschurn may have cleared out the old displays from its first floor so that it can mount more stimulating exhibitions, but it also hopes that this move will show the charming vernacular décor of the wood-panelled rooms to better effect: a willingness to engage in cultural critique is evidently not incompatible with a conservation ethic. Moreover, since my study has not involved visitor research, I cannot rule out the possibility that even uncritical exhibitions can be mitigated by intelligent guided tours and information proffered by attendants. Notwithstanding its express aim of exposing local complicity in Nazism, the approach of 'Kind und Kuh* is not reducible to a position in an affirmative/ critical binary. The exhibition suggests that contemporary ethnographic curators are likely to approach Alpine culture on its own terms, that is to say analytically, but without the ironic distance of exhibition-makers in the arts. cKind und Kuh* showed pieces of carved wood based loosely on animal forms that, as late as the early twentieth century, served as toys in remote mountain valleys. These folk objects were displayed in a conservative setting: a small village museum, on a tourist route, housed in a building in the vernacular style. However, because the objects were so primitive - many unrecognisable as animals until the captions pointed out rudimentary horns or indentations intended to suggest udders, hooves and cow bells - they contrasted sharply with the kind of folk culture conventionally displayed in Heimat museums and commodified for the tourist industry. Unlike figures in Trachty for instance, it would be impossible to mass-reproduce these 'cows' and 'chickens* for the tourist market. Yet, however crude, the objects were impressive and moving. The captions cited field notes made by ethnographer Eugenie Goldstern which confirmed that the children who owned the toys perceived them as real animals. Moreover, Goldstern's meticulous record of the variation in patterns, such as the markings representing udders, testified to the transmission of cultural knowledge and craft traditions. By analysing the non-picturesque (rather than either celebrating or mocking the picturesque), the exhibition asked that Alpine folk culture be taken seriously. Gerald Lamprecht has argued that visitors expect Austria's Jewish museums to question dominant narratives about Austria: 'Jüdische Museen sollen jene Gechichten erzählen, die andere Museen und Ausstellungen nicht zeigen wollen und/oder zeigen können* [Jewish museums are expected to tell the stories that other museums and exhibitions do not want to show or are unable</page><page sequence="17">Austrian Exhibitions about the Alps 195 to show].35 Whether or not this function of Jewish museums can be conclusively demonstrated (Lamprechťs evidence for it is not extensive), the exhibitions under discussion here would seem to suggest a more widespread critical impulse among exhibition makers who take the Alpine success story with a large pinch of salt. Having said that, a radically anti-Hdmtff view appeared only once, in the otherwise mainstream art exhibition 'Schnee. Rohstoff der Kunst*: a series of collages by Christian Ludwig Attersee, 'Ein Führer durch Österreich für außerirdische Wesen' [A Guide to Austria for Extra-Terrestrials, 1964-65], showed sexual predators from another world, their outsized genitalia prominently displayed, stalking each of the nine federal states of Austria against the background of famous beauty spots. My point is not that the exhibitions were otherwise rather tame. Unlike litera- ture, exhibitions have an institutional basis and rarely engage in Publikums- beschimpfung [insulting the audience]. However, Austrian visitors must come to exhibitions about the Alps with the knowledge that their country's most treasured Alpine icons are fiercely contested. Indeed, in their everyday lives Austrians must encounter a complex mixture of discourses on their Alpine Heimat. Some of these fall into a binary pattern of pro and contra: at the time the exhibitions were shown, the FPÖ was standing in regional elections on an anti-immigration platform, using the slogan 'Mut zur Heimat' [courage to stand up for the homeland]; at the same time, cabaret artist Viktor Gernot was gently lampooning Alpine provincialism and xenophobia on primetime ORF. In other cases, positions are oddly compounded and synthesized. The Wetterpanorama, the daily webcam broadcast from the ski resorts, shows computerized data on snow conditions to an accompaniment of folk music. And since 2008 Austrians have been treated to McDonalds' 'Hüttengaudi' advertising campaign, a parodie transalpine mishmash: created for the German market but also shown in Austria, its promotional menu is based loosely on Swiss food, with a 'Big Rösti' hamburger and Emmental cheese baked in breadcrumbs. Using both traditional and 'viral' media, it features a stylized Alpine landscape complete with chalets, men in lederhosen, cool young people in ski gear speaking impenetrable Bavarian dialect and a yodelling marmot. Thus, today's Austrians cannot escape from framings and reframings of the Alps. Taken together, the exhibitions examined here - produced by a network of professionals who have collaborated on other projects - represent mature and complex contributions to prevailing public discourses about the Alps, offering progressive content and innovative display techniques to audiences in Tyrol and Vorarlberg, a generally conservative corner of Austria. 35 Gerald Lamprecht, 'Die österreichischen jüdischen Museen im zeitgeschichtlichen Kontext', in Zeitgeschichte ausstellen, ed. by Rupnow and Uhi, pp. 213-36 (p. 233).</page></plain_text>
