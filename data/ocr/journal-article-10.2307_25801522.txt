It is not unusual for studies of Henri Michaux to focus, at least to some degree, on the hybrid quality of the artist's work. Critics have demonstrated how Michaux's textual and visual output operates as a form of self-exploration and self-preservation, analysing the complexities of the poet's often occult and opaque form in terms of an ontological escapade, a venturesome flirtation with the boundaries of sense. Nina Parish's book preserves this theme, but what distinguishes her contribution to the well-trodden field of Michaux studies is her important identification of the sign as a key through which the artist's aesthetic philosophy and formal originality might be renegotiated, and her application of an interdisciplinary methodology to an artist whose work defies frontiers. The analysis focuses on four of Michaux's most 'difficult' books, namely Mouvements, Par la voie des rythmes, Saisir, and Par des traits, which, while they span the artist's entire career, are linked here through the use of graphic signs in varying combinations with words. It is this combination of the textual and the visual that forms the starting-point of Parish's enquiry into Michaux's creative process and the possibilities for the construction of meaning within the texts. While Parish draws on semiotics and its structuralist progeny, her methodology escapes the propensity that many formalist analyses have to ensconce the reader in dry, ahistorical interpretations of the text. Rather, Parish's cogent exposition of the poetics at stake in these books is woven in a narrative at once biographical and his torical. She traces the evolution of Michaux's experimentation with ideogrammatic forms in terms of his dissatisfaction with conventional language and his aesthetic quest to find a means of expression that might represent the incessant movement of the inner self. Thus her analysis of the artist's infamous foray into mescaline and other narcotics reinserts these experiments within his aesthetic ambition to move beyond the constraints of language's syntactic and semantic grids and his attempt to grasp the rhythms of an interior, pre-linguistic state of being in the world. Furthermore, Parish's reading of Michaux in relation to the wider cultural landscape inserts her formalist analyses within a cultural constellation of the literary and visual challenges to Western systems of meaning that dominated the first half of the twentieth century. Michaux's work is thus permitted to dialogue with that of Surrealism, Dadaism, and the CoBra movement among others, so that the shape of the poet's aesthetic universe emerges through a well-managed alternation between close readings and wider cultural analysis. This cultural map enriches the reader's encounter with the texts, and, in particular relation to her topic, Parish traces a genealogy of semiotic experimentation from Mallarme's Coup de des (1897) through Barthes's Empire des signes (1970) to arrive at a reading that situates Michaux as one of the key challengers to the transparency of Western signification systems. This challenge is made manifest through his experimentation with the limits of language by way of neologism, repetition, the use of nonsense language, and, most importantly for Parish's context, the displacement of linguistic</page><page sequence="2">n66 Reviews expression in favour of graphic signs, anthropomorphic figures organized according to varying geometries that confound linear readings of the text. Parish traces this use of graphic signs to the artist's fascination with Oriental language. She notes that, while this appreciation connects Michaux to the Orientalist tradition in Europe, the artist's interest is not in representing the Orient itself, but in borrowing the gestural and visual qualities of Chinese and Japanese so as to better dislocate Western semantics and typography. She argues that Michaux's work occupies an interstitial space, somewhere between Western and Oriental signifying systems. In her chapter on book form, Parish convincingly demonstrates how the artist's maintenance of the book format defies both artistic and literary genres. Within this format, the graphic signs undermine textual order and implicate the reader in the materiality of the book before her. In this way, Michaux invites the reader's conversion from consumer to producer, and grants her entry to a space of multiplicity, where the conventions of semantic depth are undermined by the semiotic movements of the graphic ideogram, where the white space performs as syntactical and semantic punctuation, and where the reader can move vertically and horizontally, backwards and forwards through the text. This relative destruction and mistrust of language opens up alternative, non-prescriptive methods of approaching communication and initiates a reflexive form of critical reading that invests the reader in the interpretative process. This book will be of interest to all Michaux specialists, but Parish's multidiscip linary approach extends her audience and makes it a very worthwhile contribution to the study of the aesthetics and poetics of the West's experimentation with signs.
