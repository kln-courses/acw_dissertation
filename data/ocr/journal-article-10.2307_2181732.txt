<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT POLICY A LMOST everyone has been aware at one time or another of gov- ernment policies that do not fit human nature. Petty regulations that irritate the citizen are familiar; and there are more serious situ- ations in which the services of important government agencies are rendered inefficient, portions of the public are injured, and bad rela- tions with other countries promoted. One cannot estimate the exact total in consequent human misery and death, but there can be little doubt that it has magnitude. Certain- ly, if human relations are a central problem of our time, then a part of this problem is the creation of nonhuman and inhuman policies by governments. When one turns to the question of why this happens, a number of causes are evident. The people engaged in making policy, whether the level be high or low, are always subject to influences that are not of their own choosing. These include law, budget, available personnel, pressure of time, and the opinions of other government officials, the legislature, and the public. These influences, often matters that have nothing to do with the policy issue under consideration, can never- theless force a final shape which no one of the participating policy makers considers wisest or best. In addition to recognized pressures and limitations of this order, there are determining influences that come from more or less uncon- scious motives. These have to do with the emotional life of the indi- vidual policy maker and with his efforts to maintain or advance him- self in relation to his fellows. There are also conscious influences stemming from politics, in the disreputable sense of the word, from ulterior purposes, and from the 27</page><page sequence="2">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW policy maker's desire to make a right impression rather than a right decision. However, it is easy to be overimpressed with this set of determinants and to believe them the cause of all the results we do not like - that is, to find someone to blame. While there are, of course, conscienceless policy makers, there are very many who are sincere; yet the sincere are scarcely any less responsible for policy that is maladjusted to human nature. Good will is evidently not enough. The virtuous as well as the wicked are found among those who, in making policies, behave like King Canute, telling human tides not to rise. Of at least equal importance with imposed restrictions, unconscious trends, and ulterior purposes is the question of available knowledge. Policies that are exceedingly badly adjusted to human nature are frequently created because at the time when decision has to be taken there is no way of knowing how to do better. It requires after-events to reveal the mistakes. In such circumstances, the outcome, however bad, must be laid to the state of civilization's wisdom and not to the policy makers. There still remain instances - a significant number of instances- in which knowledge of human relations is available but is not used. The present article is addressed to this subject. It must be noted, however, that it is artificial to separate, as has been done here, the question of utilizing knowledge from ulterior purpose, unconscious bias, and imposed restrictions from law, budget, and similar influences. There is always some mixture of such factors in any particular instance. Moreover, these factors affect each other. A restricting law, for example, may remain on the books because there is not sufficient realization of the need to change it. The problem of utilizing knowledge has bearing on all the other influences. A question may be asked at this point: Will a greater use of knowl- edge advance or restrict the effect of ulterior purpose? This depends on distribution. If knowledge were limited to a few persons, there would be danger of its use to exploit the many. On the other hand if knowledge of principles in human relations were widely distributed, as is knowledge of principles in hygiene, it would be possible to have policy making that is both adjusted to human nature and socially responsible. General criticism could press in this direction as it now 28</page><page sequence="3">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT presses for proper sanitation. Policy makers are both permitted and restricted by the expectations of the rest of us. The notes that follow are based on observation and sum up what it seemed to me was happening in a number of different situations in which several kinds of government policy were being formed. II One of the reasons that available information about human nature and human relations is omitted in policy making is that the principles and concepts which underlie its collection and interpretation are either unknown to policy makers or are mistrusted by them. With the prin- ciples lacking, the data are necessarily ignored. In place of the missing concepts, one finds well-reasoned arguments that stand on dubious assumptions. We may begin, therefore, by comparing these two dif- ferent approaches. Principles and concepts regarding human nature and human rela- tions have the reputation of being full of speculation, rich in ideas, and low in consensus of opinion. The reputation is not undeserved, for there are wild areas, but there do exist some concepts about which there is substantial agreement. It is not possible here to attempt a rep- resentative list of such items. However, there are a number of state- ments that try to sum up areas of general agreement and these have not on the whole been greeted with undue resistance or controversy.' Although a listing is not possible, the presentation of one illustrative example may serve to give a better idea of what is meant by "con- cepts" dealing with human relations. In policy making (and in edi- torials) one encounters the belief that a custom that has been held by the people of a nation for centuries has strength and stability derived from its age. Conversely, it is said that recent customs are weak be- cause of their newness. During the war, for instance, there was an at- tempt to show on scholarly grounds that the Japanese patterns relat- ing to the Emperor were in a great measure a recent invention and did not have the antiquity claimed by the Japanese. From this it was ' See "Human Nature and the Peace" ( a statement of ten principles signed by over 2,000 psychologists), in Readings in Social Psychology, ed. Theodore Newcomb and Eugene L. Hartley (New York: Henry Holt, I947), p. 655; A. H. Leighton, The Governing of Men (Princeton: Princeton University Press, I945), pt. II, pp. 249-367. 29</page><page sequence="4">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW argued that customs regarding the Emperor were weak and that poli- cies of direct verbal attack in psychological warfare should be carried out. Concepts of human relations would confirm the idea that very new customs are unstable until they have become generally recognized among the people and habits of practice have become established. However, it would be denied that, once this period were over, antiqui- ty per se added any strength to custom. It would be said that it is not the real age of a custom that counts, but the beliefs of the people regarding age. If they set a high value on antiquity, as most people do, and if they think a particular custom is old, this will give it strength. It is not real history that gives stability to a custom but supposed history. Furthermore the strength of a custom cannot be understood in historical terms alone, either real or supposed, but must be con- sidered in the context of current situations including stresses and aspirations. Policy makers, in place of having principles of this order, have others derived from their training and experience in law, economics, government, and related fields. Each of these, is, of course, an im- portant body of thought and information regarding human behavior, but related to special aspects rather than to the totality that it is often essential to consider in policy making. Perhaps more important than the systematic training is the fact that the concepts of policy makers are also derived from their personal psychological theories. Because of one of the interesting patterns of our culture wherein "practical men" hold theory in disrepute while highly valuing the material discoveries to which it contributes, many policy makers would probably not own to having "theories." They would likely refer to them as "common sense." Nevertheless, theories they are, of a rough and ready variety. In part they come from individual experience and in part from widely shared cultural patterns. They include valuable products of historical experience, but they also include notions, prejudices, vestigial pat- terns, and sentiments that are not so much based in fact as in the desire to further hopes and reduce fears. Thus, like other theories, the theories that are called "common sense" may be true or false. Historical perspective suggests that what 30</page><page sequence="5">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT is regarded at one period as common sense may at a later time be thought a myth. Gregory Zilborg has expressed this by, "The common sense of today is the uncommon nonsense of tomorrow." An obvious illustration is the former belief that the world is flat. These remarks are not intended to be a rejection of common sense, but merely to point out that it is a mixture of theories, especially in human relations, and that one cannot afford to be uncritical in its evaluation. The necessity, as suggested by Adolf Meyer, is to have common sense "systematically checked by orderly comparison with organized technical experience." It is this that is lacking in the policy maker's concepts. The concepts derived from a scientific approach to human relations differ from the "practical" theories in that neither the experience of an individual nor cultural traditions are accepted as sufficient proof of truth. Scientific concepts that have become established are built on the joint effort of many workers participating in observation, experi- mentation, and analysis. The resultant ideas are not the final word, but they are progressively more extensive, complicated and subtle, and closer to reality than are the "common sense" theories. Related to the matter of differing concepts is the problem of seman- tics. Many of the principles of human relations are expressed in tech- nical terms which either mean nothing to the policy maker or else mislead him. In bridging this gap, it seems right that those who develop the con- cepts should be responsible for making them intelligible to those who have need of them. However, there is also some need for effort at understanding on the part of the policy maker and the policy maker's critic. There are limits in the degree to which concepts and data can be reduced to everyday phrases. Some technical terms are necessary and should be commonly understood, since simple and clear English is not necessarily accurate English when the subject is complex. The time comes when it is better to say "auto" than "horseless carriage." III Differences in concepts and differences in the use of words are probably only part of a larger contrast between policy making and science which constitutes a genuinely different way of thinking. 3I</page><page sequence="6">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW In both policy thinking and scientific thinking there is the employ- ment of definition, of categories, of facts, of basic assumptions, and of logic, especially syllogism, in order to arrive at conclusions, or to ex- plain human behavior. In policy making, however, the conclusions are supported by a structure of logic which extends high above its founda- tions in basic assumptions, and which is vast in proportion to the facts employed. Indeed, the facts are usually fastened on here and there for illustration. Much importance is attached to neatness, brilliance, persuasiveness, dramatic quality, and even the sheer nmass of logical elaborations. In the other approach, facts, observed events, and ascertained in- formation play a dominant role. Logic is used as a bridge between those facts already known and those being discovered. In itself logic does not rate highly as a means of establishing a conclusion but is rather a way of arriving as efficiently as possible at points where tests can be applied by direct experiment or by experimental observation. Brilliance of argument and logical intricacies are important only if they lead to such tests and are supported by them. Reasoning that extends a long way without touching at test points is regarded with skepticism no matter how solid it may appear. This, as Francis Bacon pointed out, must take place since even the most brilliant mind cannot construct in imagination the complexities of nature from a few prem- ises. Some things are always left out unless there are frequent "helps" by checking back to nature with direct observations. In addition to a heavy reliance on logic, there is in much of the thinking that goes into policy an assured and absolute attitude regard- ing the truth of conclusions that are put forward. This is not always evident on the surface at first since the language used is sometimes modest enough. It appears in the practice of assuming that the con- clusions are true until proved otherwise and by a readiness to argue for them like a lawyer at court trying to win a case. In the other type of thinking, there is a disposition to consider and compare. Even the fundamental assumptions useful as starting points are thought to be tentative. Similarly, the conclusions are viewed as relative rather than absolute, and susceptible to change in the light of new discoveries, though solidly resistant to change from all other pressures. 32</page><page sequence="7">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT In general, the thought sequences that go into policy making are formally presented as if they developed in an orderly manner from assumptions to conclusions after the fashion of Euclid. If one watches the process, however, it is usually apparent that the practice is in the reverse order. The "conclusions" come first from roots that are not always clear but that lie close to the abiding attitudes and beliefs- that is, the personality -of the policy maker. From such "conclu- sions" a rational framework is built downward in search of facts and commonly held ideas that can serve respectively as evidence and as acceptable assumptions, making up together the foundations. This process has some similarities to the scientific procedure of forming hypotheses but is different in the emphasis on "proving a point" rather than exploring and examining. Facts, ideas, and con- cepts that do not fit the conclusions are ignored unless liable to be brought up in counterargument. One result of all this is the development of considerable skill in making wishful thinking plausible, giving it legal or learned form, or making it forcefully persuasive. Time is spent on discussion, elabora- tion of ideas, the working-up of arguments for defense or attack, and the building of towers of syllogisms, rather than on a systematic effort to collect and analyze available data and to achieve conclusions through induction. In concluding these points, it must be admitted that the scientist presented is idealized in order to make the contrast clear. In practice he too often displays the kind of thinking that has here been attributed to the policy maker. This is especially likely to happen when he par- ticipates in policy formation and becomes identified with a plan. Such occurrences however, do not alter the fact that the scientist has at least a different ideal pattern and has also had some practice in its exercise. Nor does it alter the fact that by and large he gets closer to truth when he is being a scientist. IV It is possible to sum up, at least in part, by describing policy makers as having more in common with rationalism than empiricism, of being more like Plato than Harvey or Newton. There remains a further contrast that is implicit in what has already been said, but which 33</page><page sequence="8">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW deserves special mention. Since this is a subject difficult to present in a few abstract terms, two descriptions will be offered first. Suppose that a naturalist is studying a wilderness area for purposes of conservation. He finds that the various plants and animals exist in a state of complex interdependence. His attention is directed toward mountain sheep that are diminishing in number and also to the pres- ence of wolves. Were he a sportsman or rancher, he would be likely to conclude quickly that the wolves were the cause of the reduction in sheep and to maintain this view with no little heat. The naturalist, however, does not stop with such a single idea. He observes, theorizes, and tests his theories with further observations. He finds that the wolves kill the sheep but that they also kill numbers of other ani- mals, including rodents that are in competition with the sheep for fodder. The sheep suffer from scarcity of food, from soil depletion of certain chemicals due to erosion, from diseases, and from the winter- killing of lambs. In the end, the naturalist may find that the wolves are one of a number of serious threats to the sheep, and that their removal would help improve the sheep population. Or he might find that the balance of nature is such that the wolves aid the sheep by keeping down the numbers of other animals that eat the same food. In either event, the naturalist sees multiple forces at work in a state of interdependence, rather than a single cause that fits like a key into a lock. Moreover, he does not take sides with sheep, wolves, or other animals but tries to understand how they are interdependent. For the second picture, suppose a doctor is carrying out research on a disease such as tuberculosis. His first goal is to understand the process, and he finds before long that he cannot regard the tubercle bacillus as the cause of the disease. For one thing it is evident that millions of people harbor the germ without developing any signs or symptoms of tuberculosis. The bacillus, it turns out, is only one of a number of conditions that must be present before tuberculosis occurs. At no time does the doctor get wound up in hating the germ, nor does he weave patterns of revenge into his research. He keeps his mind on the central aim of finding out what is going on so that remedial change can be introduced. The word "functional" is a convenient term for labeling this way of looking at phenomena. It has been borrowed from physiology by cer- tain cultural anthropologists. According to A. R. Radcliffe-Brown: 34</page><page sequence="9">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT The concept of function. . . involves the notion of a structure consisting of a set of relations amongst unit entities, the continuzity of the structure being main- tained by a life-process made up of the activities, of the constituent units. If, with these concepts in mind, we set out on a systematic investigation of the nature of human society and of social life, we find presented to us three sets of problems. First, the problems of social morphology - what kinds of social structures are there, what are their similarities and differences, how are they to be classified? Second, the problems of social physiology -how do social structures function? Third, the problems of development - how do new types of social structure come into existence? . . . By the definition here offered "function" is the contribution which a partial activity makes to the total activity of which it is a part. The function of a par- ticular social usage is the contribution it makes to the total social life as the functioning of the total social system.2 Bronislaw Malinowski says: "The primary concern of functional anthropology is the function of institutions, customs, implements and ideas. It holds that the cultural process is subject to laws and that the laws are to be found in the function of the real elements of culture."3 "Functional," includes objectivity but goes beyond this to stress attention to multiple interacting forces. The underlying assumption is that things happen, however complexly, according to natural law. For the most part, the functional view of human relations and its implications do not penetrate deeply into the thinking that gives rise to policy. V One result of the absence of the functional view is that policy makers (and the critics who influence policy) look on groups of people, whether communities, nations, or socio-economic classes, as if they were individual human beings with consistent motives and logically derived, coordinated action. In reality, such groups of peo- ple behave in response to many interacting forces, and they display a wide variety of acts by individuals and subgroups. Anthropomorphiz- ing society -that is, thinking of a group of people as if it behaved like an individual man - is one of the most costly errors in analyzing human affairs. It leads to a preoccupation with plots instead of social and psychological forces. Opportunities for understanding and rem- edy are missed, while confusion, suspicion, and hostility increase. The habits of our language by which we refer to a nation as "she," use single verbs after their names, or refer to a leader as if he were 2 "Concept of Function in Social Science," Amer. Anthropologist, XXXVII, (July-September, I935). 3 "Culture," in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 35</page><page sequence="10">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW the nation itself impel us toward this line of thought and expectation. The inconsistencies and disparate actions that spring from the differ- ent parts of any large group of people, or from the existence of oppos- ing trends, instead of being recognized for what they are and analyzed in such terms are ingenuously interpreted as proof of plots. This is not to deny that plots do exist, and that some societies are more co-ordinated than others. But the plots possible are limited by the prevailing social and psychological influences. As for co-ordination, even highly organized societies with strong traditional patterns fall far short of being the integrated, manlike entity that is postulated in so many explanations of group behavior. During the war Japanese activity was time and again explained on assumptions of superhuman and supersocial unity and one-minded- ness. Granting that the Japanese have many patterns in their culture that do show more co-ordination of people than is commonly seen in urban American life, the extremes that were supposed were at vari- ance with existing concepts and information. After V-J day some of those who were piecing together in Tokyo, from records and inter- views, the wartime picture were astounded at the disorganization and conflict revealed. They were moved to remark that the reason we won the war in spite of the "snafu" from which we suffered was because the Japanese "snafu" was much worse - so bad, in fact, that it made our co-ordination appear efficient. Nevertheless, explanations in terms of elaborate plots continue. A distinguished Far Eastern expert said shortly after the war that "they" had issued a "directive" to all Japanese. He estimated that it contained the following orders: (i) Make a big play about food and try to convince the Americans that it has to be imported. This is necessary in order to avoid the social and economic changes that will occur if food is not imported. (2) Make a great show of co-operation in order to shorten the occupation. (3) Make a name for openness and good-fellowship by admitting your mistakes; but also point out that others have made mistakes too, and we are all human beings together. (4) Drive a wedge wherever possible between the Allies. (5) Promote civil war in China by siding with Chiang. (6) Use the Japanese militarists as a lightning rod; get the atten- 36</page><page sequence="11">HUMAN NATURE AND GOVERNMENT tion of the Americans on to them and off the rest of us. (7) By indirection, save the Emperor, who will save us. These "orders" were thought by the Far Eastern expert to consti- tute a careful, deliberate plan transmitted to all ranks with appro- priate "schooling" in what to say to the Americans and how to say it. He doubted that there was any significant amount of spontaneity in the behavior of the Japanese we encountered every day. The functional point of view and the concepts of human relations would suggest that the above "orders" are in fact a partial list of a number of reactions by various Japanese, reactions that would be found among some people in any large population under similar cir- cumstances. No nation-wide plot was necessary to explain the Japa- nese anxieties about food, their fear for the Emperor, their dis- illusionment with the wartime leaders, antipathy toward the Chinese Communists, and so on. The fact that some of the moneyed classes might see advantages to themselves in these widespread attitudes, and hence encourage them, did not mean that they were responsible for them or "controlled" them. The plot interpretation suggests a spurious consistency and long-range purposiveness in behavior that is seldom if ever seen in nature; it induces one to overlook other trends among the people, and it obscures a functional understanding of the inter- acting forces that go to make up the several different kinds of overt behavior. The history of man's understanding of the physical world is the history of progress away from an anthropomorphic view. Storms, floods, famines, and epidemics were originally thought to be due to inherent spirits that had the loves, hates, vanities, and disposition to revenge that are found among people. No storm or fire just happened as a result of interacting forces in nature. It was perpetrated by an- thropomorphic beings that had schemes in mind. "Somebody does it deliberately" was the universal assumption, and explanation con- sisted in finding out who he was and why. When a plague hit the Greeks before Troy, it was because Phoebus Apollo . . . came down from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart ... and he let fly an arrow; and there was heard a dread clanging of the silver bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but afterward, aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote; and the pyres of the dead burnt continually in multitude.4 4Andrew Lang, Walter Leaf, and Ernst Myers, The Iliad of Homer (Mac- millan &amp; Company, i9ii). 37</page><page sequence="12">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Even among the scientific pioneers, the anthropomorphic view per- sisted at subtle levels. As late as three hundred years ago in academic centers of Europe metals were said to have "spirit" and to "agitate" with anger when heated. Heavy objects were said to fall down because of "an appetite to rest and to conserve their nature in that place which is most proper for them." Gradually, however, by slow and painful degrees, as science and a functional view developed, people came to see, as Hobbes put it, the absurdity of "ascribing appetite, and knowledge of what is good for their conservation, which is more than man has, to things inanimate." Having eliminated the anthropomorphic view of nature, we have come now to the need of eliminating the anthropomorphic view of mankind. This is not merely a paradox but means that we cannot have policy adjusted to human nature when it is based on a type of thinking that projects into societies and nations the simple motives and plots of individual persons. The idea that societies move according to multiple forces that affect them within and without is not wholly absent from the thinking of policy makers and their critics. It is, however, repeatedly overwhelmed (especially when emotions are aroused) with interpretations which assume that "somebody does it deliberately," and that the task is to find the somebody and retaliate or propitiate. The movements of na- tions, the behavior of groups within nations, the acts of management and labor are thus reduced to the simple formula of a cave man priest explaining the weather. The implication in this view, one that brings both slow deterioration and quick havoc, is the belief that remedy lies in punishing groups of people for their behavior without understanding and dealing with the forces producing that behavior. False issues then develop around whether to have a "tough" policy or a "soft" policy, with all the ob- scuring emotions these and similar words bring with them. Policy, then, often fails to be realistic in human terms because of absolute values and preconceptions that are held together by consistent logic based on dubious assumptions and insufficient data, and because it lacks the concepts and the information essential in a functional view of human nature and human relations.
