This interesting book is of the nature of a challenge to what the author considers inadequate conceptions of human society. In it he has brought together a large number of articles, published from time to time, and has given them a logical unity by his stress upon certain theses essential, in his opinion, to the understanding of the human situation. Culturology, or the science of society, is to be distinguished from psychology, on the one hand, and from sociology as usually conceived as a science dealing with human relations. Rather is cultural anthropology to be grasped as the matrix within which these social sciences operate and without which they are likely to be misled. In his own sphere Dr. White is an assured determinist and rejects what he calls "free will" as the alternative. Culture has its own laws and may be said to move with its own momentum. Man, it would seem, has no control over his future though he may predict its course of change. It is clear that Dr. White is impressed by the circumambient character of what he calls culture and regards as impossible any genuine independence of it. It is for him axiomatic that we live and move and have our being in "culture." Free will is a sort of x which would have nothing but external relations with it and could have no leverage upon it or relevance to it. It would correspond to another dimension having no tie-in with the cultural process. I mention this perspective because philosophers in the past have considered free will mainly in the context of a rather individualistically conceived ethics. One other general idea should be mentioned before we engage in giving a general idea of the specific contents of this stimulating book. It is likely to be classified as reflecting a technological approach to history. That, I take it, would not be precise. Dr. White does want to check the drift to vagueness which has been appearing in the writings of many anthropologists when they define culture. Tools and symbols should, in his opinion, be kept in the foreground. But the stress is not upon technology in the narrower sense. Machines by themselves do not control man's destiny. It is the entire complex which is operative according to its immanent laws in relation to the earth and its usable energies. While, then, he recognizes a certain kinship with Marxism, his historical attachments are more with Morgan and Tyler. Let us turn now to the content of the book. It consists of fourteen chap- ters under four main headings-, namely, Science and Symbols, Man and Culture, Energy and Civilization, and Culturology. The included chapters outline these topics with remarkable economy. Thus science is sciencing, a special kind of human behavior appliable in any sector of experience.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 587 Again, mind is minding and involves the use of symbols. It is the symbol which has brought culture, as a new and distinct order of phenomena, into being. And this outlook is set over what Dr. White calls the philosophy of anthropomorphism, anthropocentrism and free will. It should be noted that this gives the context of the meaning assigned to free will. While I, as a critical materialist, have sympathy with White's thesis, for instance, that mind is minding and that traditional dualism is being out- grown, I still think that our symbols need clarifying in this psychological domain. Probably, we are both seeking an adequate behaviorism within the cultural perspective. The reader must bear in mind Dr. White's main drive as a scientist. Dualism and mysticism are his enemies. It is in accor- dance with this perspective that we find one of his most interesting ideas. He holds that scientific interpretation will appear first and grow faster in those areas where the determinants of human behavior are the weakest and least significant. In other words, the nearer home man comes the more anthropocentric and prejudiced he is. Are the social sciences more difficult than the physical sciences? Or is it harder for men to achieve adequate attitudes and objective ideas? In the second part I noted, particularly, the author's differentiation between the psychological and the culturological interpretation of human behavior. This is clarified by his treatment of genius, the great man, the locus of mathematical reality, and the problem of incest. The last chapter grapples with the current notion of man's control of his own destiny. The author is persuasive in showing the weaknesses of any outlook which ignores culture. Just how culture comes to expression in social groups when what we usually call decisions are made is, perhaps, the point at issue. What is invigorating about Professor White's book is the way in which he develops all the implications of his perspective. Here we have a cultural naturalism of a disciplined and muscular type which completely eschews sentimentalism. Empirically minded philosophers are likely to agree with his main contentions while yet desirous of pushing analysis further in co- operation with cultural anthropologists. There can be little doubt, however, that the book is a significant challenge in the social field. It cannot be ignored. ROY WOOD SELLARS. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</page></plain_text>
