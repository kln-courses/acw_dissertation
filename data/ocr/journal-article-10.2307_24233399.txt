<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVO XXVIII (2005) SALUT, SULTANATE OF OMAN REPORT (2004-2005) Alessandra Avanzini, Alexander V. Sedo ν and Chiara Condoluci The site of Salut, located about 2 km north of the modem town of Bisyah, was a centre of a large ancient agricultural oasis in one of the most fertile valleys of centrai Oman (Fig. 1). The members of the Harvard Archaeological Survey in the Sultanate of Oman, first surveyed the site (recorded as BB-15) in winter 1973. Based on the surface material, two major periods of occupation were determined: "one in the latter half of the first millenni um BC and one in the 13th-14th centuries AD"1 Later, D.S. Whitcomb published the sur face collection of mediaeval pottery2. In winter 1974-75 Salut was visited by the archae ologists of the British Archaeological Expédition and was listed in the "Gazetteer" as "site 38"3. Finally, the work of the team of the Birmingham Expédition showed especially the third millennium remains widespread within the extensive archaeological area of Bisyah, with a reconstruction line of the falaj and the location of Salut4. The Italian Mission to Oman (IMTO) of the Pisa University began exploring the mon uments of the ancient oasis on the request of H.E. Abdulaziz M. Ar-Rowas, the Adviser to H.M. the Sultan for Cultural Affairs. The first visit to the site was paid on September 23rd, 2003, and allowed us to understand the great potential value of the monuments, and their great significance for ancient Omani history and archaeology5. 1. 2004A Campaign (SL04A) The ancient oasis of Salut occupied a large area in the western part of a wide valley north of Bisyah, crossed by the wadi Bahia and the wadi Sayfam. The core of the com plex was the ruined fortress set up on a rocky outcrop (Fig. 2). The archaeological survey of the area was conducted by IMTO, in spring 20046. 1 Cf.

The ground pian of the fortress, close to the ovai, roughly 50x60 m in size, has been divided on the basis of the evidence of structures and on the large amount of pottery scattered around. The surveyed area was the hill of Salut and the surrounding plain for a total of 15000 square mètres. On the top of the hill there is a modem rectangular masonry structure in locai sand stone. Rows of medium size square sandstone slabs, clearly visible on the top surface of the hill, indicate the defence wall of a fortress. There is a structure in the same building technique on the foot of the eastern slope of the hill7. On the west side of the top there are some isolated circular structures made of roughly-hewn stones and stone slabs, probably pertaining to a later phase than the stronghold. The entire territory is scattered with archaeological remains, testifying to an intense peopling of the oasis over various periods. There are what are probably collapsed houses (heaps of stones where the pottery is more abundant), and irrigation structures. The prés ence of irrigation channels (falaj) can be perceived by following the lines of wells8 that cross the plain north-west and south of the hill. Some of them appear to have been re stored in modem times, are stili working and being used for agriculture. A large circular structure, badly preserved, lies at a distance of about 300 m west of the Salut hill. It has walls of large squared sandstone blocks, preserved in some parts to the second row; the diameter is 19 m, considering the inner ring-wall. Comparison with a similar building in this area, suggests dating it to the third millennium BC9. Another stone circular stmcture, located in the plain close to the south-western slope of the hill, was included in the British Archaeological Expédition list10. More ruined and similar stmctures are in the plain north-east of Salut (the proximity to a locai road must have favoured the pillage of the stones for building materials). To the south-east of the hill two walls, made of small stones and mud, are stili stand ing. Local reports state that the building is reputed to be a very ancient mosque, but the lack of archaeological materials is not enough to suggest its dating11. An Islamic cemetery occupies the lower part of the north-east slope. The pottery collection is very homogeneous over the whole investigated area, with a concentration on the top surface and on the slopes of the hill. A previous typology of the shards, made on the basis of the intemal/extemal surfaces and the inner components, re Cerato (archaeologist and topographer, Padova), Chiara Condoluci (archaeologist, Pisa), Martina Rugiadi (archaeologist, Naples), Mr. Khalifa Mansoor and Saif Al-Shamsi (représentatives of the Office of H.E. the Adviser to H.M. the Sultan for Cultural Affairs, Muscat). The work was carried out from 22.03.04 till 6.04.04. 7 The inhabitants of the région maintain that this structure was a well. 8 The well openings are in masonry, while the lower part is completely dug into the bedrock. 9 De Cardi B. - Collier St. - Doe B. 1976: 164,39, fig. 37. 10 De Cardi B. - Collier St. - Doe B. 1976: 164,38. 11 The mosque is on the Birmingham Expédition plan, cf.

The surface finds in clude also two bronze arrowheads and a bronze pin, ail found on the surface of the hill. The material collected on the surface, mainly pottery, reconfirmed the existence of an extensive mediaeval occupation of this part of the valley, which could be divided into three periods: Early Islamic (VIII-X centuries), Middle Islamic (XI-XIV centuries), Late Islamic (XVI century - modem times). On the other hand, the presence of such surface material as bronze arrowheads and several distinct types of pottery vessels picked up from the surface of the central mound, indicate that a much earlier occupation may have taken place, even dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC. 2. 2004B Campaign (SL04B) The north-eastem corner of the eastem part of the fortress (UT5), next to its stone de fence wall, was chosen as a place for the test-soundings in October 200412 (Pl. 1). The 12 The archaeological excavations of IMTO were carried out from 9.10.2004 till 5.11.2004 (10.10.2004 27.10.2004 - test-soundings on the site, 28.10.2004-5.10.2004 - work on documentation). The members of the team were: Alessandra Avanzini, Alexander V. Sedov, Alessandra Lombardi (archaeologist, Florence), Chiara Condoluci, Ahmad Yehia (architect, Beirut), Said Ai-Salmi, Saif Ahmad Salem Al-Farsi, and 342</page><page sequence="5">top part of a wide mud-brick wall was clearly visible here on the surface (it was cut by a shallow dépression caused by rainwater drainage). The initial size of the sounding was 4x6 m, oriented north-south. Later, the sounding was enlarged towards the east and north. Thus, finally, we made a sounding 6x8 m oriented east-west (Fig. 3) with an additional enlargement towards the north, across the defence wall of the fortress. We summarise be low the results of the test sounding following the description of determined construction phases from the bottom to the top, from the more ancient layers to the more recent ones. 2.1 Main test-sounding: description of phases, structures, layers and stratigraphical units (US) The lst construction phase (Pl. 1, Pl. 2). The ancient surface of the bedrock, on which the structures of the fortress have been erected, was reached in the south-western corner of the sounding, at the point - 3.92 m from the modem surface of the hill. Here a dark brown coloured layer (US20), consisting of very soft silt mixed with a large amount of middle size stones and sandstone chips, covered the bedrock. Its thickness was about 0.3 0.35 m. Several body potshards of very sandy, dark-brown, thick-walled wares were found in the US20. A very low mud-brick wall (M18), only 0.38-0.4 m wide and 0.35-0.37 m high, discovered in this deepest layer, was probably intended for levelling and strengthen ing the slope of the mound before the érection of buildings. The entire layer US20 including soft filling and wall Ml8 was covered by a very hard stratum US 19, circa 0.45 cm thick. It was made by compacting destruction material (bro ken mud-bricks mixed with very hard-packed clay mortar). A very limited number of pot tery fragments (only 3 body shards) and almost no organic material were found in US 19, which may indicate that the formation of the stratum not resulted from living activities at the site. Most probably, it should be interpreted as a sort of construction, something simi lar to the foundation or socle, on which the floor and walls of one of the earliest rooms (room 2a; see below) were erected: at least the bases of three walls, M5, its continuation M19 and Mil, are to be correlated with this construction whereas the fourth wall, M10, also delimiting this room, was placed directly on the bedrock. The constmction technique used in these two walls, MIO and Mil, is rather similar: their foundations were made from three rows of medium-size squared sandstones and slabs placed with clay mortar, whereas the upper parts were constructed in mud-bricks, 48-50x36-38x6-7 cm in size. The other two walls of the earliest building, M5 and M19, were made exclusively from mud-bricks. The wall M5 (2.50 m long and 0.55 m wide), for instance, was constructed with one row of mud-bricks, 55-56x36-38x5-6 cm in size, altemated with a thick (circa 4 cm) layer of mortar. Remains of clay plaster were pre served on its interior surface. The third type of constmction technique can be observed in Khalifa Mansoor Saif Al-Shamsi (représentatives of the Office of H.E. the Adviser to H.M. the Sultan for Cultural Affairs, Muscat). The team was sporadically enriched by the presence of représentatives from the Ministry of Héritage and Culture of the Sultanate of Oman. Fifteen unskilled workmen from Nizwa were employed for the excavations. 343</page><page sequence="6">■·· Fig. 3 - General view of the main test-sounding. wall M9/12 which was also the outer defence wall of the fortress. Its total thickness is 2.8 m. The external part (designated as M9) was made with sandstones, but only the first or the outer row of these stones was placed regularly in the so-called 'dry masonry tech nique'. The internai part of the wall (designated as M12) was made of one row of mud bricks, and the space between two parts was irregularly filled up with small and medium size stones mixed with clay and mud. The earliest structures of the Salut fortress unearthed in the main sounding could be described as follows. The corridor-like room la, 1.2-1.3 m wide, was constructed along the outer defence wall M9/M12, which served as the north-western limits of the building. The north-eastern part of the room was totally occupied by a staircase built from mud-bricks, 47x30x5-6 cm in size. Four steps, 0.38 m wide and 0.25-0.27 m high, were preserved, and staircase probably led to the top of the defence wall M9/12 and to the top of the monumentai plat form discovered in the eastern part of the sounding (see below). The wall M5 and its con tinuation, wall M19, running parallel to the defence wall M9/12, separated the room from the adjacent compartment, room 2a, located immediately to the south-east. Walls MIO and M11 delimited room 2a from the south-east and south-west accordingly which thus measured 2.3x4.2 m (the north-eastern wall of room 2a was apparently wall Ml but ini tially without internai 'skin', which was added later, in the 2nd constructional phase; see below). Roughly in the middle of room 2a, the remains of a low mud-brick partition wall (M6a) were discovered, the purpose of which is obscure. It was used as a foundation for 344</page><page sequence="7">another wall, wall M6, circa 0.65x1.90 m in size and about 1.0 m high, built from 56x30x5 cm mud-bricks. It seems quite probable, that wall M6 was in fact noi a real wall but a sort of blockage narrowing room 2a. Rooms la and 2a were connected each other through a doorway, circa 1.0 m wide, with a mud-brick threshold. The corner of what is probably another room, room 3a, de limited by the walls MIO and M16, was unearthed in the southern part of the sounding (here the space for excavation was so small that only very top parts of the corresponding walls and upper part of the filling of the room were revealed; it is difficult, for the mo ment, to affirm with certainty that this compartment also belonged to the earliest phase of the building). There was some différence in the initial level of the floors or the first living surface in rooms la and 2a. The floor in room la, designated as US18floor, was made from well compacted, sometimes trampled clay. The accumulation above the floor (stratum US 18) was not very hard and consisted of broken mud-bricks mixed with crumbly mud, flecks of charcoal and very few pottery shards. It was circa 0.4 m thick and covered the lo west step of the staircase. The initial floor, or a sort of pavement, in room 2a (US15floor) was built on the top of the construction US19 mentioned above (which was apparently absent in room la). It was made of clay mortar mixed with Straw and small pebbles (the same mixture was used for making mud-bricks and the wall plaster), was a brown-greyish colour with many flecks of charcoal and small fragments of pottery intentionally trampled into its surface. The pavement was about 3-4 cm thick in the centre and was slightly thickened towards the walls of the room. The level of the US15floor in room 2a perfectly corresponded with the level of the second floor in room la, designated as US16floor. Both floors were built in the same manner, although US16floor in room la was less hard and compacted. The accumulation above the US16floor in room la, designated as stratum US 16, was circa 0.25 m thick, light-brown in colour, and consisted of rather soft, loose mud mixed with very large amount of animai bones, flecks of charcoal and pottery fragments found in great quantities along the wall M9/12. It was not separated from the overlying stratum US 14, circa 0.45 m thick, by any horizontal surface, but was separated from US 16 be cause of its différent character. The stratum US 14 was more compact, more greyish in colour, and consisted of mud-bricks fragments mixed with mud, animai bones, flecks of charcoal and very limited number of pottery shards. It covered the two top steps of the staircase (MI3), and, probably, could be considered as destruction level indicating the end of the lst construction phase of the earliest building. The accumulation in room 2, above the pavement, was designated as stratum US 15. It was very soft, yellowish-grey in colour, and revealed a lot of ash and charcoal, large amount of pottery fragments and sometimes even complete vessels (small carinated bowls). The stratum covered room 2a completely, reaching its maximum thickness (circa 0.8 m) in the corner formed by the walls MIO and Mil, progressively reducing its thick ness towards the north-western part of the room and towards the doorway connecting rooms 2a and la. It was undoubtedly caused by a great fire which destroyed room 2a, the heat of which was so strong that the entire surfaces of the mud-brick walls MIO, Mil, partition walls M6a and M6 were completely baked and changed colour to yellowish. 345</page><page sequence="8">Similar to room la, US 15 in room 2a can be considered as the same destruction level in dicating the end of the lst construction phase of the earliest building. The 2nd construction phase. The ruins of the earliest building described above were al inosi completely sealed by a horizontal level traced ali over the main sounding. This lev el, designated in room la as US13floor, in room 2a as US12floor, and yellowish-grey in colour, was made by compacting and trampling the filling of the previous structures and covering the majority of the partition walls of the earliest rooms (walls MIO, Mil and M19). In room 3a, the corresponding level, designated as USllfloor, was slightly lower and was made of clay mortar brown-greyish in colour. In some places on the floor we could see traces of footprints, probably made during its construction. The construction of wall M14, running in a south-east direction beyond the limits of the sounding, could be correlated with the above-mentioned horizontal level USllfloor. The following strata, seemingly the intentional filling of early structures, were above the common horizontal level. Inside room 3a there were two lithologically similar layers, US 11 (circa 45 cm thick) and US9 (circa 50 cm thick), both light-brown in colour with dark-grey stains (especially in the southern part of the room), and composed of broken mud-bricks mixed with crumbly loess, pottery fragments and a large amount of animai bones and charcoals. Layer US 11 was slightly more compact in comparison with US9. Inside room 2a there was layer US 12 (circa 50 cm thick), light-brown in colour and con sisting of crumbly silt mixed with pottery fragments and a large amount of charcoals, concentrated especially in its lower part, and layer US7 (circa 40-45 cm thick) containing several large and medium size stones and gravel. Room la revealed layer US 13 (circa 50 cm thick), light brown in colour, consisting of crumbly and soft loess containing sand stones and few pottery fragments. It seems quite probable that ali these layers, US7, US9, US11, US12 and US13, were, in fact, part of a construction which served as a foundation for the monumentai building of the 3rd construction phase. The 3rd construction phase. The layers of this phase are différent in origin, and repre sent the period of the final occupation of the ruins of mud-brick buildings, the construc tion of which should be referred to the earlier phases. Pits dug down from the top stratum (USI) disturbed the layers, and sometimes the pits were hardly even visible during the course of excavations. That is why the pottery assemblage related to this phase revealed a number of fragments of mediaeval ceramic vessels. A massive, wide mud-brick platform (initially it was denoted as walls Ml, M2 and M7) was discovered in the eastern part of the trench (Fig. 4). It was constructed from mud-bricks 53-55x38-40x9-10 cm in size, placed in six horizontal rows. From the north east, the platform was terminated by a defence wall of the fortress consisting of two parts - a mud-brick wall (M3) made from one row of mud-bricks similar in size, and a stone wall (M4) made from one row of sandstone slabs (in fact, this is one wall M3/4, roughly 0.7-0.8 m wide, the external surface of which was made up from sandstone slabs whereas the internai surface from mud-bricks). Pit US2 heavily disturbed the top surface of the platform. The stratum US3 connected with the second constructional phase was traced in the trench south-west of the wall MI. It consisted of dark-brown, compact loess mixed with 346</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 4 - Main test-sounding: the well - preserved wall MI. broken mud-bricks, flecks of charcoal and fragments of animal bones. The maximum thickness of the deposits was about 1.0 m (in the north-western corner of the trench, where also a lot of degraded mud-bricks were found). Cultural deposits were accumulat ed above the well preserved and very compact US 3 floor covering the entire area of the trench south-west of the wall M1. The floor was constructed from trampled mud mixed with a whitish lime substance. Several pits unearthed in the north-eastern corner of the trench were apparently connected with this floor. A sort of construction made from sand stone slabs was discovered in the north-western corner of the trench: two slabs were placed vertically against the façade of the wall Ml, whereas the third one was placed hor izontally on the US3 floor. As will become clear from the forthcoming excavation (see below the description of the results of SL05A campaign) we were succeeded in discover ing the northeastern corner of a vast hall with pillars (room 1). A lot of pottery fragments, mostly from Storage vessels, were discovered on the US3 floor. An L-shaped bone object, apparently for decorating furniture or a wooden box, was discovered on the floor among the pottery fragments. A terracotta figurine, camel's head, was also found in this stratum. The 4,h construction phase. The layer (USI13), which made up this phase, consisted of a top few centimètres of very loose crumbled silt and sand mixed with pottery fragments and flecks of charcoal. Greyish in colour, it had accumulated above the USI floor, which Ali pottery fragments collected from the surface of the trench were denoted as belonging to USO. 347</page><page sequence="10">covered the entire area of the trench above mud-brick walls discovered underneath. The floor was constructed from trampled earth and was occasionally disturbed by shallow pits and open fireplaces. One of such fireplaces, 0.6x0.65 m in size and 0.2 m deep, was dis covered in the southern part of the trench, next to a large rectangular pit, 1.1-1.35x4.2 m in size and 0.45-0.65 m deep (initially it was denoted as room 1 and its filling consisted of rather compact brownish loess mixed with pieces of broken mud-bricks, flecks of charcoal and fragments of pottery like US2). Apparently, the USI floor and the stratum accumulated above it represent the very late, mediaeval phase of occupation of the fortress: the floor covered the ruins of Iron Age mud-brick structures located underneath as well as the remains of the northern defence wall of the fortress. 2.2 Extension sounding: description ofdeposits and stratigraphical units (US) The main trench extended towards the north (Pl. 1), where a corner formed by two per pendicular stone walls (M3/M4 and M8) was clearly visible on the surface. We supposed that it could be the beginning of the defence tower occupying the north-eastern corner of the fortress. In order to prove this hypothesis, an additional sounding, roughly 5x8 m in size, was dug into the slope of the fortress north of the main trench. Instead of clearing the façades of the defence wall and tower, we surprisingly cut across the defence wall of the fortress and discovered two phases of its construction. lst construction phase. The initial defence wall of the fortress was wall M3/M4 built using a combination of techniques: its internai part was erected from mud-bricks whereas the external part from sandstone slabs. The width of the wall was about 0.90 m. The ex ternal masonry was made with sandstone slabs of various shapes placed in regular rows and fixed with yellow clay mortar mixed with sandstone chips. Its preserved height is about 3.40 m. The foundation row of wall M4 was in a shallow trench dug into the sur face of the naturai mound (Fig. 5). A charcoal sample was collected from the trench against the lowest row of masonry unearthed so far, which gave us the terminus post quem for the time of the wall's construction (see below). 2nd construction phase. Later, after a certain period of time, the defence wall of the fortress was significantly enlarged (Pl. 1). For this purpose the slope of the bedrock was first levelled with stones, earth, clay mortar and pottery fragments belonging to the strati graphical units US 6 (filling between walls M9 and M4) and US 10 (accumulation outside wall M9). Then, an additional wall (M9) made of sandstone was placed on the slope of the mound at about 2.30 m north and parallel to the initial defence wall. The space be tween the two walls was filled up in two différent ways: (1) to the south-east of the trench and around the NE corner of the fortress the wall was made from sandstone (M8); (2) to the north-west of the trench, along the north-western slope of the fortress, it was made from specially prepared clay mixed with small sandstones and, sometimes, with pottery fragments (the filling of this part of the wall was divided into two stratigraphical units - US4 and US5 - but they constitute a single unit). The conclusion that the north-west fill ing was, in fact, intentional is based primarily on its homogeneous character: the section revealed no slanting layers as we can expect in the case of collapsed wall. The masonry of wall M9 (Fig. 6) is not very différent from the wall of the lst phase - it 348</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 5 - Extension sounding: foundation of the defence wall M3/M4. Fig. 6 - Extension sounding: view of the defence walls M9 and M4. 349</page><page sequence="12">was also made of large and medium size sandstone slabs, placed in irregular rows; the sandstones are fixed with yellow clay mortar mixed with sandstone chips and small peb bles. The upper part of this wall, visible outside the trench, seems to be dry-stone masonry but this cornes from its long exposure to the atmosphère. The foundation of the wall M9 was placed directly on the slope of the bedrock (in the south-west corner of the trench it was at the point - 5.13 m, and in the north-east corner at the point - 7.02 m). The levelling of the slope outside the wall was strengthened with an intentional filling of silt mixed with stones, clay mortar and pottery fragments (in sev eral places it contained few large stones fixed vertically), and, along the foundation of the wall, with clay mortar and sandstone chips. The preserved height of the wall M9 is about 3.0 m in its northern part and 4.70 m in its southern part. The wall M8, constructed with the same technique as wall M9, is preserved to a height of about 3.60 m, and its foundation row was placed partially on the bedrock, and partially on the sandstone chips levelling. Its north-western part constitutes a single work of ma sonry with the wall M9, whereas the south-eastern part leans against wall M4. The accumulation outside the wall M9 was divided into three stratigraphie al units: US8 composed of the collapsed material from wall M9 (large and medium size sandstone slabs mixed with silt and pottery fragments); US 10 - the material used to level the slope consisting of compact, brownish yellow loess mixed with large and medium size sand stone slabs and chips; US 17 - rather compact brownish silt representing the ancient accu mulation at the foot of the defence wall above the bedrock (there were several ash and charcoal lenses at the very top of US 17) when it was in function. We can reach the preliminary conclusion that the defence wall M4 belongs to the lst constructional phase of the mud-brick buildings unearthed in the main trench, while its enlargement (wall M8/M9) should be correlated with the 3rd constructional phase. 3. 2005A Campaign (SL05A) The preliminary analyses of the pottery material from the 2004B test sounding and the first results of radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples show that the foundation of the Salut fortress and the first three construction phases of its occupation should be dated close to the late 2nd - early lst millennia BC (the so-called Early Iron Age II period on the Omani Peninsula). The site was re-occupied in mediaeval (VIII-XVI centuries) and mod em (XX century) times. The primary goals of the third campaign14 were to verify the proposed dating of the 14 The period of work was from 1.02.2005 till 22.03.2005 (1-4.02 and 19-22.03.2005 - documentation work, 5.02-17.03.2005 - excavations at the site). The members of the team were: Alessandra Avanzini, Alexander V. Sedov, Chiara Condoluci, Marco Serradimigni (archaeologist, Pisa), Filippo Virgilio (archae ologist, Pisa), Riccardo Baudinelli (archaeologist, Pisa), Costanza Odierna (archaeologist, Pisa), Nils Hellner (Architect, Trieste), Sergio Martelli (draftsman, Pisa), Said Ai-Salmi, Saif Ahmad Salem Al-Farsi and Khalifa Mansoor Saif Al-Shamsi (représentatives of the Office of H.E. the Adviser to F1.M. the Sultan for Cultural Affairs, Muscat), Ali Salim Mohad Al-Kathiri and Muhammad Ahmad Al-Jahfali (representa 350</page><page sequence="13">site in more détail and to expose the Early Iron Age structures of the wider area. In addi tion, we made a survey of the surrounding valley exploring remains of the ancient falaj system, the foundation of which was apparently connected with the Early Iron Age fortress of Salut. 3.1 Excavation Two areas were chosen for the excavations in the 2005A season: Trench 1 in the north western corner of the upper part of the hill (which was, in fact, an enlargement of the 2004B sounding), and Trench 2 in the northern part of the "lower structure", the so-called "well", at the eastern foothill of the fortress (PI. 3). Trench 1. The following major phases of occupation were determined in the course of excavating Trench 1 : three phases from the Early Iron Age period (Salut 1 and Salut 2 with intermediate phase Salut la), and one phase from the relatively "late" or mediae val/modern occupation of the site (Salut 3). Salut 1 phase. The remains of the first structures built in the Salut fortress were un earthed in the north-western corner of the trench. A corridor (roorn la) was constructed along the northern defence wall of the fortress (Figs. 7-8). Its eastern part ended with a mud-brick staircase which probably led to the top of the defence wall (Pl. 1, Fig. 8). Three small compartments with wide openings were constructed in the western part of the northern wall of the corridor. Remains of a horizontal wooden beam and a door-socket stone were found in the wide entrance of the most eastern compartment, probably indicating a wooden door when the structure was in use. The stepped floor of the corridor had a stone threshold roughly in the middle of the room. Two entrances connected the corridor (room la) with contempo rary premises, which have not been excavated. The visible remains (top parts of walls) lead us to surmise that quite similar structures, i.e. long corridor-like rooms, were also built along the western defence wall of the fortress. Several radiocarbon analyses of charcoal samples and a good assemblage of diagnostic pottery provide the chronological limits of 1300-800 BC for the foundation and period of existence of the structures belonging to the Salut 1 phase. There is evidence of a quite long and intensive "constructional life" for the structures of the Salut 1 phase - several layers of successive floors with anthropogenic filling (humus strata with pottery frag ments, animal bones, flakes of charcoal etc.) with, between them, several phases of addi tional renovated walls which partially blocked access to the rooms etc. This period of rénovation may be denoted as Salut la phase. tives of the Office of H.E. the Adviser to H.M. the Sultan for Cultural Affairs, Salalah). 30 unskilled work men from Nizwa were employed for the excavations. 351</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 7 - Trench 1, room la from Ν.

Significant rénovations of the lay-out and general organisation of the site were undertaken at the beginning of the Salut 2 phase: the outer defence wall, at least its northern and western sectors, was widened, and a monumental mud-brick platform, which was delimited at the east by the stone wall M26 (Pl. 4; Figs. 9-10), was construct ed. In their construction, the walls of the mud-brick structures of the Salut 1 phase were cut at a certain height and the space between the walls, i.e. the rooms of the Salut 1 phase, was filled up with mud and fragments of mud-bricks. From what we can judge, the north-western corner of the platform was built in this way, but for the rest of construction the ancient settlers of Salut chose another technique, namely specially built mud-bricks walls delimiting small rectangular compartments roughly 2.0x2.5 m in size erected on the bed-rock, and the space between them filled up with gravel and mud. The top surface of the platform was sealed with 2-3 rows of horizontally placed mud-bricks. The total height of the platform was about 2.5 m in the western part and about 1.5 m in its eastern and southern parts. The platform was used as a foundation for the mud-brick building (Building 1) unearthed in the north-western corner of the trench (Pl. 4). The remains of the Building 1 are rather scarce but they give an idea of its general lay out. The core of the building was a sub rectangular room (room 1) roughly 7.2x9.3 m in size in its northeastern corner. Six pillars (stone bases of only four pillars remain in situ) once supported the roof of the room. A stone pavement with four low steps was con structed in the south-eastern corner of the room 1 (Figs. 11-12). !

A central partition wall (M22) divided the structure into two adjoining premises, room 2 and room 3. One more entrance located in the western wall of room 1 led to a corridor, roughly 1.5x9.3 m in size (room 4 west of room 1). The staircase in the south-eastern corner of room 1 led, probably, to the room (room 6) located south of room 1 (completely destroyed). Most probably, the main access to Building 1 was located in the southern wall of the room. In the south-western corner of Trench 1, outside the limits of the Building 1, an oven built in stones and mud-bricks was unearthed. A complete bronze vessel, a cauldron with two vertical loop handles, was found inside the oven (PI. 11:9; Fig. 19: 6). Remains of two rooms, related to the building but not directly connected with the structures unearthed, were discovered in the south-western and north-eastern parts of the Trench 1. The premises denoted as room 5 are located south-west of Building 1. Originally, probably, it was a kind of passage around structure 4, in which there appears to be the remains of a fortification tower. Room 6 adjoined the north-eastern corner of Building 1 on the outside. It had a separate entrance in the middle of its southern wall. Room 6 is rectangular in lay out, roughly 3.0x5.0 m in size (PI. 4). It seems that only half of Building 1, namely its northern wing, was unearthed during the 2005A campaign. In the southern part of the Trench 1 we were pleased to discover a fiat rampart constructed using mud-bricks, which led from the edge of the monumentai platform towards what we hope is the main entrance to Building 1. The rampart ends with two gigantic irregular shaped stones used, probably, as bases for the pillars of a sort of propylon or portico (there are remains of a circular trunk of a column on the top surface of one of the bases). Remains of a stone pavement were found next to the northern base. The rampart led from the edge of the monumentai platform where a kind of a porch, 3.0x12.5 m in size, was constructed adjoining the external surface of the wall M26. Salut 3 phase (mediaeval occupation). The top stratum of the site was badly disturbed by "late" structures belonging to the mediaeval period. They are normally circular con structions, approximately 2.5-3.0 m in diameter, made from roughly dressed stones and stone slabs (Fig. 13). Apparently, they represent some sort of dwellings with floors in trampled mud. Their filling consists of dark brown loose loam mixed with medium size stones, flecks of charcoal, ashes, animal bones and pottery fragments. Many small (post holes), medium and large size pits could be also associated with these structures. Trench 2. The second trench was opened at the lower structure of the fortress located at the eastern foothill of the mound (Fig. 14). The eastern external surface of the outer wall, which was curved, was cleaned down to the virgin soil. The total preserved height of the masonry is about 2.5 m. The construction technique of the masonry is absolutely identical to that of the northern defence wall of the fortress. Threre is no doubt that both walls are contemporary. The sounding on the top surface unearthed three perpendicular walls dividing the inner space of the lower structure. The cultural deposits were dug down to about two meters. Ali the material recovered from the excavation (mediaeval pottery) shows a quite inten sive "late" re-occupation of the structure. 355</page><page sequence="18">v- , , " j&amp;M 35- :y- - IS . *** • £M . * -. -»r , -,i&gt;-®*".. ?^%plSiiil Fig. 13 - Trench 1, mediaeval structure in the north-eastern corner of the platform. m &gt;■ , * &gt;""••' , ; ' ^is'' */ t ?&gt;- ^jw* Fig. 14 - Trench 2, general view from NW. 356</page><page sequence="19">3.2 Survey In addition to the excavation, a survey was conducted of the surrounding area explor ing remains of the second Early Iron Age settlement (Salut 2) and the ancient falaj system apparently also connected with the Early Iron Age occupation of the oasis (Fig. 16). Falaj. Remains of the falaj system were traced north-west and north of the Salut fortress. The mother-well is located approximately 4.3 km north of the Salut fortress, immedi ately at the side of the modem highway Connecting Jabrin and Bisyah, a few meters south of the bed of a shallow wadi. Its top diameter is about 2.0 m, and its depth some 12.5 m. The spoil ring around the mouth of the well is about 6.0 m in diameter with a maximum height of about 1.2 m. A sounding through the western side of the spoil ring determined the stratigraphy of the accumulation around the well. Two strata were distinguished: US2 - a rather compact, light-brownish loam interrupted by gravel lenses at the bottom, above the ancient surface of the plain, and USI - a compact gravel stratum mixed with large stones on top. It seems that the lower stratum (US2) was the alluvial accumulation of the plain (or fans), through which the shaft of the mother-well was dug, whereas the top stra tum (USI) is what remains of the gravel surface of the wadi bed where the water was tapped. Fragments of modem pottery jugs were found at the very top of the USI, close to the modem surface, indicating, most probably, the modem use of the mother-well (Fig. 16). mmt y- l; t yrmmm'jM* m Fig. 15 - The falaj: open channel. MOTHER WELL Fig. 16 - Sketch plan of ancient irrigation system. 357</page><page sequence="20">A line of shafts with spoil heaps around is visible over a distance of about 2.6 km south-west and south of the mother-well, entering the Salut plain between shallow mounds in 1.8 km north of the Salut fortress. The distance between the shafts, apparently interconnected by a drainage gallery, is about 15 m. Entering the Salut plain the line of shafts with its drainage gallery becomes an open channel (Fig. 15), about 3.5-4.0 m wide and about 1.5-1.7 m deep, from which the water was apparently distributed to the fields once located on both sides of the channel. The channel with two major curves, towards east and north was accordingly traced over a dis tance of about 1.0 km. It stops at about 1.2 km from the Salut fortress changing once again into a line of shafts running southwards. This second line of shafts is, no doubt, the modem re-activation of the old falaj system - the shafts are constructed from concrete blocks. Fragments of typical Early Iron Age pottery vessels were found at the surface of the spoil heaps bordering the open channel, indicating the possible date of construction of the entire falaj system. It should also be noted that the system described, which tapped water from a shallow water table, i.e. from alluvial fans or from the bed of the wadi, is of the so-called 'shallow falaf type which was very typical of the Early Iron Age period (late 2nd - mid lst millennium BC) on the Omani Peninsula15. Salut 2 settlement. Ruins of one more Early Iron Age settlement (Salut 2) were discov ered immediately north-west of the beginning of the open channel, roughly 2.0 km north west of the Salut fortress (Fig. 16). Unfortunately, the settlement is located on the land of a private farm and is fenced. It was thus very difficult and almost impossible to conduci a detailed survey without prior permission and the site was visited only briefly. As far as we can judge from this short visit, the settlement consists of three separate elongated mounds about 4-6 m high, which apparently cover the ruins of mud-brick structures. The total size of the settlement is about 200x300 m. A necropolis, consisting of 30-35 lower stone mounds, is located a few dozen meters south-west of the settlement. Diagnostic pottery shards (carinated bowls, plates and large Storage jars with criss-cross décoration) prove clearly that the site is contemporary to the ancient fortress of Salut. The existence of the site was not mentioned by the previous surveys conducted in the area either by the Harvard Expédition16, or by the British mission17. 4. Material The finds resulting from the survey and excavation consist of pottery vessels and met al, stone, bone, clay and shell objects. With the exception of the pottery, most of the ob jects were found in the top strata of the site and on its surface. Below, we give a short general description of each category, sometimes with preliminary typology. The study of 15 For détails and description of the Early Iron Age falaj Systems in U.A.E. and Oman see: Boucharlat R. 2003: 161-172. 16 See: HUMPHRIES J.H. 1974: 49-76. 17 See: De Cardi B. - Collier St., Doe B. 1976: 101-174. 358</page><page sequence="21">pottery types and their distribution according to the stratigraphy of the site, which is one of the determining aspects for dating, is in progress and will be presented in détail in forthcoming reports. 4.1 Pottery The overwhelming majority of the pottery found in the différent strata of the site is handmade. According to the paste composition and treatment of the surface, several types of wares could be distinguished: coarse ware; common buff ware; red- or brownish slipped ware; painted ware. The catégories of pottery vessels determined were: large Stor age jars (at least five types according to the profile of the rims) (PI. 5: 1-3); 'craters' (three types); basins with straight or slightly rounded walls (two types) (Pl. 6: 1-6); small jars (three types) (Fig. 17: 4); bridge-spouted vessels (Fig. 17: 2; PI. 7: 1-3); carinated bowls (PI. 7: 4-7); bowls with rounded sides; plates; beakers; cooking pots (olla); lids (Fig. 17: 1); stands; pedestal vessels; pitchers; oil lamps. Décoration of the pottery vessels is rather simple - straight and wavy engraved lines, bands of criss-cross incisions, circular and grain punctuation, painting in red and black. But there are several fragments with applied snake motif décorations, which is particular ly interesting in the assemblage. One fragment has an oval-shaped head of a snake coiled at the lower part of a vertical handle (PI. 8: 2). A badly preserved fragment of the wall of a closed vessel has parts of the bodies of two snakes shown in relief. The other body shard had a more worked design: two snakes, différent in size, with triangular-shaped heads and elongated tongues; the small one touches the head of the big snake (Fig. 17: 3; PI. 8: 3). Several shards with représentations of snakes were found at the Iron Age sites in Khat, Bithnah, Rumeilah and Al-Qusais18. It should also be remembered that a fragment of a closed vessel with a snake in relief was found in Salut during the Harvard expédition ar chaeological survey19. Sometimes there is some very elaborate décoration on the handles of the so-called 'oil lamps'. These are vessels with a shallow open reservoir with straight walls and a flat tened long horizontal handle, and almost ali the pieces from Salut have traces of sec ondary burning inside the reservoir. There are three types of design on the handles: en graved or impressed lines and/or grooves, snake motifs, and représentations of other ani mais. The first type of design is an engraved herring-bone décoration or a décoration of im pressed oblique grooves (Fig. 18: 1). The pieces of the second type can be divided in two catégories. In the first one there is no diversification of the subject appearing: the snake motif is simply an application on the upper surface of the handles. The snake représentation is usually decorated with un 18 De Cardi β., Kennet D. - Stocks R.L. 1994: 52, fig. 8: 40, 41; Benoist A. et alii 2004: 27, fig. 7:1-3; 29, fig. 9: 1-2, 5, 7; 30, fig. 10: 2; Boucharlat R. - Lombard R 2001: 238, fig. 14; Taha M.Y. 1982-1983: 87, fig. 15:c. 19 Humphries J.H. 1974: 73, fig. 10: b. 359</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 17 - Salut, 1: lid; 2: spouted vessel; 3: fragment of jar with snakes; 4: jar; 5: lid; 6: soft-stone vessel. 360</page><page sequence="23">" j""|'ll 1111111111 l||||||Hli|rill|l ti t|)l ll|IH 111111111 i I (il il ι HI I j 1 / ο \ 1 2 U-4 E o &gt; o £'«_ ^"* ■ ^ _ -'^i ; :"*': iiMiTiM .WO Tst". ^ V -i * '■*' 5i&gt;-&gt; " %£&amp; ■ " j&lt; "i jiii 111111111 ii ji ittjtttjjni iji ti i j 11 ii 111 :l 4 3 2 1 / o \ 1 2 L4-UK r n Fig. 18 - Salut, 1-4: oil-lamps; 5-6: backed-clay figurines. 361</page><page sequence="24">evenly punctuated circles along the wavy body (Fig. 18: 2; PI. 10: 6). The total length of the handles is 9.7-14.5 cm and the total width is 3.5-5.1 cm. In the second category, every piece has one peculiarity, namely that the handle takes the form of the animal and ends with the head of the snake. The décoration is similar - unevenly placed punctuated circles along the body. One of the représentations has a slightly projected nose with a slightly opened mouth shown as a wide groove; the eyes are shown as two punctuated circles. The other représentation is rather caricatured and grotesque: the nose, slightly projected, has two nostrils, the opened mouth is showed as a wide groove on the edges of the object (Fig. 18: 3; PI. 10: 5). The sizes of these two handles are: length 11.2 and 13.1 cm; width 5.4 and 4.4 cm; thickness 2.2 and 2.2 cm. Only one piece has the third type of décoration. On the upper surface of the handle there are several représentations in relief: an axe with a long handle in the middle (its biade with engraved décoration is pointed to the righi); two fishes shown on both sides of the axe; a ram's head with globular eyes and C-shaped horns ended the handle (Fig. 18: 4; PI. 10: 7). The dimensions of the piece are: length 14.0 cm, width 4.6-5.7 cm, thick ness 2.8 cm and the diameter of the reservoir is 15.0 cm. Fragments of handles with a simple engraved décoration and an appliqué snake motif were picked up from the surface of the Salut fortress (site BB-15) by the members of the Harvard Archaeological Survey20. Two similar examples of oil-lamps or incense burners were published as coming from the 'Mound of Serpents' in Al-Qusais (Dubai)21. 4.2 Metal object s The metal assemblage is represented by différent kinds of tools and weapons, vessels, personal ornaments and décorations, and objects having a possible votive function. The majority of pieces were made from copper or bronze (analyses of the alloy have not yet been carried out which is why we denote pieces as copper/bronze), but the presence of fragments of several iron objects should be specially mentioned. It is well known that "until the middle of the lst millennium BC, the metal mostly used in the so-called "Iron Age" Omani cultures was bronze"22, and the finds of objects made from iron are ex tremely rare23. It seems that here, too, Salut is an exceptional site among the contempo rary monuments of the Omani Peninsula. Weapons and tools. Altogether twenty one complete (18 pieces) and fragmented cop per/bronze arrowheads were found in différent strata of the top periods of occupation of the site and/or on its surface. Ali belong to the category of the tanged arrowheads or ar rowheads with the stem. Following the general typology proposed by P. Lombard24, they were divided into three types: leaf-shaped, triangular, and lanceolate arrowheads. Type 1 - leaf-shaped arrowheads (12 pieces). The most numerous pieces, différent in 20 Humphries J.H. 1974: 73, fig. 10: a, d. 21 TahaM.Y. 1982-1983: 87, fig. 15: a,b. 22 Boucharlat R., Lombard R 1985: 60. 23 Lombard P. 1989: 25-37; Magee P. 1988: 112-117. 24 Lombard P. 1985: 206-208. 362</page><page sequence="25">size, have a more or less rounded biade and elevated midrib (in some cases absent). The biade section is roughly rhomboid, the stem is quadrangular in section. Total length of pieces - 3.8-5.7 cm; length of biade - 2.9-4.4 cm (Fig. 19: 2, PI. 11: 1). Type 2 - triangular-shaped arrowheads (2 pieces). The pieces have elevated midrib; the biade section is fiat, the stem has ovai or rhomboid section. Total length of pieces - 4.0 4.5 cm; length of biade - 3.2-3.4 cm (Pl. 11: 2). Type 3 - lanceolate arrowheads (7 pieces). The section of the biade is rhomboid or fiat while the section of the stem is quadrangular; the midrib is only slightly elevated. Total length of pieces - 4.9-5.3 cm; length of biade - 3.2-3.8 cm (PI. 11:3). One of the leaf-shaped arrowheads could be classified as a spearhead although this is rather hypothetical (Fig. 19: 3; PI. 11: 4). The shape of the biade is asymmetrical triangu lar with a very flattened raised midrib. The blade's section is rhomboid; the tang is rec tangular in section. The total length of piece is 11.0 cm; the length of biade -7.0 cm. In fact, considering Potts' classification25 the piece is too light (31,67 g) for a spearhead. It should also be noted that the object from Ghalilah tomb, quite similar in size (length is 9.5 cm), was classified by P. Lombard as an arrowhead26. A fragmented copper/bronze shaft hoe was found in the top strata of occupation of the site, on the US3floor inside the room with pillars. The biade is sub-rectangular with a rounded lower part and sharpened edges; its section is ellipsoid (PI. 11: 7). Typologically similar hoes are known from Qala'at al-Bahrain, Rumeilah and other Early Iron Age sites in the Eastern Arabia27. The dimensions of the object are: length -9.5 cm, width -10.8 cm and diameter of shaft -2.6 cm. The functional purpose of the complete copper/bronze object found in the top strata of the site is not clear. Its shape is roughly ovai with a centrai shaft-hole raised as a cylinder. It is probably some kind of shaft-handle for a wooden object. The length of the piece is 7.4 cm, its width is 3.8 cm, its thickness 0.8 cm and the diameter of the hole 2.2 cm. A massive iron loop-handle was also found in the top strata of the site. Probably, it was a finial of iron rod, hook or knife. The diameter of loop-handle is 3.0 cm and the section 0.8-1.0x1.3-1.5 cm. Two complete copper/bronze razors with straight backs and slightly rounded sharp ened edges, probably used to scrape leather, were found in the top layers of the site. One of the pieces could be classified as a razor with tang handle, and the other as the razor with fiat handle which is the continuation of the biade. The length of these razors is 3.3 and 4.3 cm. Quite a number of fragments of copper/bronze tools in the shape of pointed rods, rounded or quadrangular in section, were found in différent layers of the top period of the site. Unfortunately, in the majority of cases it is not possible to specify precisely what ali the pieces are. Probably, some of them might belong to needles, while others to pins, awls or other kind of similar tools and/or personal ornaments (see also below). Two almost complete needles (PI. 11: 5) according to their sizes, were most probably used for sewing 25 PottsD.T. 1998: 182-187. 26 Lombard P. 1985: 208, fig. 105: 365. 27 See, for instance, BOUCHARLAT R. - LOMBARD P. 1985: pl. 63:1. 363</page><page sequence="26">leather. The length of complete needles is 7.0 and 27.0 cm and the diameter of section is 0.4 and 0.5 cm. A few fragments of knives were found in the top layers of the site and there are two al inosi complete pièces. One is a biade of a knife made from iron. It has a straight back, a pointed tip (the other end is broken) and one sharpened edge; the section is triangular. The length of the piece is 6.6 cm; its maximum thickness 0.7 cm. Another piece is made from copper or bronze, and has a rather thin double-sided biade, a rhomboidal section, and a pointed tip (the other end is broken). The object was folded. The proposed length of the object is 7.5 cm and its thickness 0.3 cm. An object, which could be the lower part of a biade with broken tip of an iron double sided dagger, was found in the USI on the top of the monumentai mud-brick platform. The biade is rhomboidal in section, and has pointed midrib. The maximum width of biade is 5.6 cm; its maximum thickness 2.4 cm. One more fragment of biade also of a double sided iron dagger, together with fragments of iron tanged handle and a piece of rod, was found on the US3floor in the 'pillared hall'. A complete copper/bronze chisel was made from a rounded rod. One end of the tool, slightly banded, was flattened and sharpened, whereas another end bore traces of ham mering on its top surface (Pl. 11: 6). The length of the object is 3.4 cm, the diameter of the rod 0.5 cm. Another chisel was made from a fiat copper/bronze rod. One end was sharpened, and another one broken. The length of object is 3.2 cm and its section 0.3x0.6 cm. A similar object, but slightly bigger in size, is known from Rumeilah28. A complete tool made from copper/bronze rod quadrangular in section was found in the top strata of the site. One end is pointed and another rounded: it was probably used as an awl. The length of the object is 9.3 cm; the size of the section 2.6-3.2x2.6-3.2 cm. A fragment of a probably similar tool made from rectangular copper/bronze rod was found on the US23floor in room 2 of Building I. Both ends are broken. The length of the piece is 4.4 cm and its section 2.2x2.8 cm. A fragment of iron rod, rectangular in section, with a pointed end, could be also interpreted as part of an awl. The length of the object is 3.9 cm and its section 4.5x5.3 cm. Vessels. A complete copper/bronze cauldron was found inside the oven discovered im mediately to the SE limits of Building I (Fig. 19: 6; Pl. 11: 9). It has a hemispherical body with fiat, slightly convex base and two vertical loop handles fixed at the upper part of the body. The rim was folded and flattened on the top, and elaborated on the exterior with a wide groove. The handles, ovai in section, were fixed to the body by four rivets fixing to both the external and internai surfaces of the body two parallel thin rectangular plaques obtained by hammering the lower parts of each handle. The cauldron was hammered from a single piece of metal. Traces of secondary burning on the exterior as well as the place where it was found indicate a probable utilitarian purpose of the object. The diame ter of the rim is 31.0 cm, the diameter of base 22.0 cm and the height of the vessel 20.0 cm. The maximum height of the handles above the rim is 5.5 cm, the maximum width of the handles is 12.0 cm and the diameter of the rounded section of the handles is 1.2 cm. 28 Boucharlat R. - Lombard P. 1985: pl. 62:13. 364</page><page sequence="27">Two bronze bowls from the grave in Β y dia (Emirate of Fujairah), dated close to the be ginning of 2nd millennium BC, have single vertical handles similar to the cauldron from Salut29. Unfortunately, their sizes are too small for a direct comparison. Two bronze ves sels, a cauldron and a large bowl, are known from Iron Age graves in Israel. Their size as well as their rounded vertical loop handles with similar technical détails of the fittings could be taken as good parallels for the cauldron from Salut30. A small copper/bronze conical lid of a miniature vessel was found on the US23floor in the room 2 of Building 1. It has a shallow ovai cavity on the internai surface. The diame ter of lid is 3.1 cm and the height 1.8 cm. Personal ornaments and décorations. A number of copper/bronze finds could be clas sified as personal ornaments. These are rings with rounded open ends, probably used as fingerings, and few banded wires used, probably, as clasps. Rings with pointed opened ends may be earrìngs. The same function is suggested for a ring fragment with an elabo rate pendant which was somehow attached to it. A small bell-shaped pendant with circu lar hook on the top is of particular interest. A small hemispherical bead, made from gold foil and slightly dented in many parts, was found on the US23floor in room 2 of Building I. The diameter of finger rings is 2.1-2.5 cm; the diameter of complete earrings is 1.7 and 2.3 cm; the diameter of the golden bead is 0.6 cm. Fragments of rounded or flattened cop per/bronze rods, sometimes with one end pointed and the other decorated with grooves, could be identified as parts of pins. The diameter of the rods is 2.3-3.5 cm. Fragments of at least two copper/bronze mirrors in the form of dises were found in the top strata of the site. There are remains of a handle attachment on one of the fragments: two small holes (a rivet preserved in one of the holes) near the edge of the disc. Many objects, identified below as copper/bronze plaques, were found in the top strata of the site, scattered around above the US23 floor in the eastern part of room 2 of Building I. Some are rather small, thin rectangular pieces with two holes on the edges, while others, with slightly rounded ends, have the third additional hole in the centre with, in some cases, the rivets for fixing stili preserved. The size of the complete rectangular plaques is 0.8-1.0x2.4-2.6 and 1.1x3.6 cm, the diameter of the holes 0.2-0.3 cm and the length of the rivets 1.2-1.3 cm. A trapézoïdal plaque with folded edges was probably once attached to the tip of a leather beh. Its size is 0.6-1.5x1.9 cm. There are also a number of hemispherical or convex/concave plaques with edges slightly pleated for attachment. The diameter of the hemispherical plaques is 1.8-2.6 cm. They were most probably used for decorating leather belts or perhaps other kind of dresses, but we also suggest the différent function of the rectangular pieces for restoring wooden and/or clay objects (vessels?). Among the hemispherical plaques there are two of particular interest. Their external top surfaces were decorated with dots punctuated from the inside. We are in full agree ment with Fombard's proposai about the use of a similar plaque from Rumeilah as the metal base of a quiver, made in perishable material; the arrows would have been slotted, inside the quiver, in this base with cavities/holes31.

The following pièces were identified as votive objects. A complete copper/bronze 'plaque' in the form of snake with a banded body, triangular head and pointed tail was found on the top surface of the monumental mud-brick platform, immediately SE of the 'pillared hall' (Fig. 19: 1; Pl. 11: 8). The top surface of the body was richly decorated with tiny punctuated dots, and the eyes were shown as slightly bigger punctuated dots. The length of the 'plaque' is 16.9 cm, the width 1.3 (head), 1.0 (body) and 0.3 (tip of tail) cm and the thickness 0.5 cm. A fragment of another similar 'plaque' was also found: the first band of the body and the rhomboidal head are preserved. Identical 'plaques' are known from the so-called "Mound of Serpents" at al-Qusais32. The presence of such objects in the form of snakes as well as appliqué snake décoration on the pottery vessels probably testify to the existence of a spécifie cult widespread in the south-eastern Arabia (including Salut) during the Iron Age period33. A miniature copper/bronze axe was found in the top strata of the site (Fig. 19: 4). Its shape is trapézoïdal with a tubular shafted handle; the edge of the biade is sharpened. The piece was made by hammering. The length of the biade is 4.0 cm, the width 1.5 and 3.6 cm, its thickness 0.25 cm, the length of shaft 2.2 cm and its diameter 0.6 cm. Several non-utilitarian bronze axes, différent in shape from the Salut piece, are known from an Iron Age grave context in Al-Qusais, Hili 8, Qarn Bint Sa'ud and from Rumeilah34. A massive copper/bronze object was found on the US3 floor in the room with pillars. Despite the very poor state of conservation, it is reminiscent of a sort of finial of a wood en (?) object (standard?) with a hemispherical base and a V-shaped antenna-like projec tion at the top, terminating with something similar to camel's head. The proposed diame ter of the base is 12.0 cm and the height of the object is about 8.4 cm. Some comparisons for the object, although quite remote, could be found in Luristan bronzes and in the antiq uities from Scythian mound burials ('kurgans'). 4.3 Stone objects The lithic assemblage is mainly represented by grìnders, pestles, hammer- and whet stones, crushes, polishers etc. Some of them were definitely used as combined tools, for example, for hammering and grinding. Most of the pieces were made from pebbles picked up in the neighbouring wadis, and were, no doubt, linked to domestic activities such as the grinding of cereals. Vessels and personal ornaments made from stone were found as well. Vessels. During our two campaigns of excavations we found seven fragments of soft stone vessels and two alabaster vessels. Ali fragments were found in strata belonging to 32 TahaM.Y. 1982-198: 87, fig. 16. 33 In addition to al-Qusais see also snake motifs in pottery décoration from number of Iron Age sites in Eastern Arabia such as Rumeilah, Tell Abraq, Muweilah, Bithna etc. Cf. also snake sacrifices in Qala'at al Bahrain (H0jlund F. - Andersen H.H. 1997: 134-144). 34 For comparisons, see the 'hache à collet' in Lombard P. 1985: 212-213, figs. 108-109; Boucharlat R.-Lombard P. 1985: 61, pl. 62:15-16. 366</page><page sequence="29">the top period of occupation of the site or were picked up from its surface. Similarly to other scholars, we prefer to use the generic term 'soft-stone' instead of more spécifie ter minology such as 'chlorite' or 'steatite' vessels, which needs the precise mineralogical analyses. Our preliminary classification of soft-stone vessels is based on simple visual and comparative examination, and, in general, follows the classification proposed by P. Lombard: bowls, converging-wall vessels, suspension-vessels, compartmented-boxes35. Bowls are represented by several fragments of flared walls and fiat bases. The rim of such vessels is usually thick and horizontally cut and in rare cases has a beak-like profile. Their diameters are between 15.0 and 22.0 cm and the thickness of the walls is 1.0-1.2 cm. One of the fragments with a flattened rim has three engraved signs (graffiti) on the outside: the first is rhomboid with a dot inside, the second has a butterfly shape, and the third is rhomboid with a criss-cross sign inside (PI. 9: 5). A somewhat similar decorated hemispherical bowl from Mleiha was dated close to the Late Iron Age period36. One more vessel, with a beaked rim and less flared walls, shows the most committed engraved déc oration of ali the soft-stone vessels from Salut (Fig. 17: 6; PI. 9: 1). It consists of five hor izontal bands (stripes): the top band consists of 13 parallel lines; the second contains rec tangles filled with three sériés of five vertical circles with central dots, and separated by vertical stripes with a criss-cross pattern of engraved lines; the third band has oblique lines which alternate with triangular fields filled with single circles with central dots; the fourth band has a series of circles with central dots and the fifth band consists of criss cross lines. A fragmentary wall (its thickness is 0.7-1.5 cm), decorated with a horizontal row of circles with central dots surrounded by two bands of criss-cross incisions, belongs to the so-called converging-wall vessels (PI. 9: 3). These are a type of closed vessels, and usual ly their profile is rectilinear but it can also be rounded and the base is fiat or convex. An almost complete small vessel, with a slightly concave base and rectilinear profile, belongs to the type of suspension vessels. It has four ovoid cavities for inlays on the up per part of the wall which were probably used for the insertion of metal plaques. We con sider that these plaques were probably used for the suspension of the vessel. A phitomor phic design, in the form of four leaves, is symmetrically engraved on the body (PI. 9: 2). The diameter of the vessel is 6.3 cm and its height is 5.3 cm. One fragment from Salut belongs to the compartmented-boxes, the type of vessels which usually has a rectangular shape, slightly flared walls and a fiat base; the internai part of the vessels is divided into two symmetrical compartments. In contrast with sam ples usually found on the Omani Peninsula, which have rectangular shaped internai com partments, the fragmentary piece from Salut has circular compartments. On the exterior there is an engraved décoration of triangles between vertical lines. The appearance of these kinds of vessels probably dates close to the Late Bronze period37, and they are usu ally found in the grave context. Compartmented-boxes are known from Iron Age sites such as Rumeilah, the Bithnah graves and Tell Abraq, but the circular shape of the inter 35 Cf. LOMBARD P. 1985: 192-194. 36 Cf. Bourchalat R. - mouton M. 1991: 23-33, fig. 3. 37 Lombard P. 1985: 193. 367</page><page sequence="30">nal part of Salut example has no comparisons. The size of the fragment is: 5.3x6.1 cm and the diameter of compartments is about 4.0 cm. There is a big fragment of a soft-stone vessel from Salut, which does not fit the above mentioned types. It's an open vessel with a rounded rim and slightly converging walls. A light stepped carination separates the rim from the body. The external surface is intention ally rough worked. The diameter is 20.0 cm. Probably, this kind of vessel could be classi fied as pot. A small circular lid of light grey soft-stone belongs to the type of lid with a short grip (handle)38. The bottom is broken but it seems quite finished. On the upper surface the lid has a décoration composed of one row of double circles with central dots while around the edges there are short oblique lines (Pl. 9: 4). The upper diameter of the lid is 6.7 cm and the height is 3.4 cm. A similar lid is known from Rumeilah39. The stone finds also include two almost complete alabaster vessels. The smaller one could be identified as a cosmetic vessel (Pl. 9: 7). It has cylindrical shape, pointed rim and fiat base. Its height is 3.6 cm and the diameter of the rim is 2.9 cm. The second one belongs to the category of 'beehive'-shaped vessels: it has a fiat base and a rounded rim (Pl. 9: 6). Its height is 7.3 cm and the diameter of the rim is 5.0 cm. The alabaster 'bee hive'-type vessels are well known from monuments in modem Yemen40. Personal ornaments. The assemblage of personal stone omaments is represented most ly by beads and pendants. There are two carnelian beads, one is barrel-shaped, and an other flat-rhomboidal. Both have smoothed surfaces and a canal drilled from two sides; the total lengths are 1.0 and 1.6 cm and the diameter of the canal is 0.1 cm. Two flat-dis coid shaped beads have rounded edges and smoothed surfaces; one is made from a dark grey stone, and the other from green stone; the diameters of the objects are 0.7 and 1.1 cm and the diameter of the holes is 0.2 cm. One barrel-shaped bead was made from whitish agate, and a tronconical bead with linear decorative incisions on the exterior from limestone (the length of pièces is 2.0 cm, the diameter is 1.7-1.9 cm and the diameter of the hole is 0.3-0.6 cm). A fragmentary rectangular shaped pendant, made from dark grey stone, has an ovai section. The object has a large hole at the preserved end; the edges are rounded and the surface is smoothed; its size is 1.1x3.9 cm and the diameter of the hole is 0.3 cm. Uncertain is the function of a ring made from whitish polished stone (Fig. 19: 5): it was probably a pendant, but it might be also used as a sort of beh buckle. The ring sec tion is fiat with smoothed edges; the diameter of the object is 3.0 cm and the diameter of the hole is 1.6 cm. The beads from Salut can find parallels in the Early Iron Age sites on the Omani Peninsula such as Rumeilah41 and Fashgha42. A conical stone button, probably made from polished alabaster, was found in the top 38 Cf. CORBOUD P. et alii 1996: 63. 39 Boucharlat R. - Lombard P. 1985 : pl. 61:6. 40 Cf.

On the fiat base there are three pairs of holes connected with each oth er through the triangular hole in the centre. The height of the piece is 1.5 cm and the max imum diameter 3.8 cm. An almost identical alabaster button is known from a burial con text in Bithnah43, and a similar shell button was found in Fashgha44 (see also below, "Bone objects"). Other objects. A sériés of six small stone balls was found on the surface and in the top strata of occupation of the site. They can be divided into two catégories. The first in cludes balls with a well smoothed, polished surface, and could be pièces for a game. They were made from yellow-brownish stone, probably sandstone, and have a spherical or ovoid shape with an ovai section. The diameters of pieces are between 1.5-2.6 cm. The second category comprises rough spherical/ovoid balls, with an ovai section, made from pebbles or sandstones. The diameter of the pieces is 3.6-4.9 cm. The shape and the rough surface suggest their use as sling projectiles. There is a lack of clarity in the function of the fragmentary 'plaque' made from dark grey soft-stone. It is rectangular shaped and has a rounded central cavity with a hole de limited by linear engraved décoration. The size of the object is 3.2x2.9x1.0 cm and the diameter of the hole is 1.8 cm. An oval-shaped stone disc, probably made from whitish alabaster, has a small cavity in the centre on one side (it looks like drilling was begun). The edges are rounded and the surfaces are polished; the size is 2.7x3.2 cm. 4.4 Bone objects From the top strata of occupation of the site came a few ornamentai objects in bone. Among them there is an unfinished object made from an animal jawbone with worked faces (size 3.5x11.8 cm); a disc-shaped bead made from a fish-bone vertebra; a fragmen tary 'plaque' probably made from ivory; a L-shaped plaquette used, most probably, as the décoration of a wooden box or piece of furniture (the object has a centrai fiat groove with four holes on its longer part, while another hole is on the short L element; the edges of the plaquette are rounded, its top surface is polished whereas the back side is rough; the size of the object is 8.2x20.0x0.8 cm and the diameter of the holes is 0.3 cm); a frag mentary discoid-concave button with three holes placed in one row on the back (its inter nai and the external surfaces are polished, the rounded edges are slightly bulbous at the bottom; the diameter is 6.8 cm, the thickness is 0.3 cm). The button is quite similar to the Bithnah piece made from ivory45. 4.5 Clay objects In this category we describe personal ornaments, loom-weights and figurines which were, in the majority of cases, décoration of pottery vessels and/or terminations of lid handles. 43 Corboud P. et alii 1996: pl. 27:3. 44 Phillips C. 1987: fïg. 39. 45 Corboud P. et alii 1996: pl. 27:2. 370</page><page sequence="33">One complete and two fragmentary pendants were made from the walls of slipped pot tery vessels. Their shapes are rectangular and ovai with a fiat section and a centrai hole, the edges are slightly smoothed (the length of the objects are 2.2-2.9 cm, its width is 1.7 2.6 cm, its thickness 0.5-0.7 cm and the diameters of the centrai holes are 0.4-1.3 cm). A spherical baked-clay bead has red slip on the exterior. The diameter of the object is 0.7 cm, the diameter of the centrai hole 0.1 cm. A series of loom-weights were found in différent layers of the site. Ali of them are made from fragments of pottery vessels, and have an irregular rectangular or disc shape, a fiat section and a centrai hole. The dimensions of the pieces are: length 3.1-8.4 cm, width 3.7-6.9 cm, thickness 1.0-2.6 cm, and the diameter of the centrai hole is 0.5-1.7 cm. The function of an irregular shaped object, also made from a wall of pottery vessel, is unclear: instead of a hole it has a deep cavity in the centre. Its size is 5.1x6.0x2.4 cm and the depth of the cavity is 1.3 cm. It could possibly be an unfinished loom-weight. Ceramic loom-weights were found in Iron Age context of Teli Abraq46. The worked fragments of pottery walls were used also as small lids. One of these is a disk with smoothed but damaged edges and a shallow cavity on its top face; the diameter of the piece is 5.3 cm, the thickness is 0.7 cm. Another one has a quadrangular shape. Its size is 4.4x4.6x1.5 cm. Several zoomorphic and one anthropomorphic complete and fragmented baked-clay figurines were discovered in différent strata of the site. One of the fragments was found inside the clay filling of additional defence wall (US5). It is the central part of the body of a quadruped with the junction of the back legs and the fragmentary tail. It was made from very compact reddish paste with a grey core (insufficient firing); the surface is roughly smoothed with visible signs of the stick (PI. 10: 1). The total length of the frag ment is 9.1 cm; the width is 5.2 cm. Judging by the curve of the back (a hump?) it could be a carnei représentation47. A protome of carnei (?) figurine was probably the end part of the handle of a vessel (Fig. 18: 5; PI. 10: 2). The reddish paste is medium coarse with a dark-grey core, the ex ternal surface has reddish slip. Représentation is rather realistic - the animal has a long neck decorated with oblique incisions, the triangular-shaped muzzle has a closed mouth and a pointed ear (the other one was chipped). The height of the piece is 9.2 cm. Another quite realistic représentation is the complete figurine of a bird, apparently a duck, made from whitish, very compact fine paste (Fig. 18: 6; PI. 10: 3). It was probably the knob of a ceramic lid. The height of the object is 3.9 cm. An almost identical frag mentary terracotta figurine was found in a Hellenistic context in Mleiha48. Rather realistic is also the représentation of the ram's head which serves as the knob of ceramic lid (Fig. 17:5; PI.8: 1), discovered on the floor of one of the rooms in Building 1. The lid was made from rather compact reddish paste covered with flaked reddish brown slip on the exterior. The animal's head has a slightly open mouth and C-shaped 46 POTTS D.T. 1990: 126: fig. 155. 47 Cf. two similar fragmentary figurines from Rumeilah: BOUCHARLAT R., LOMBARD P. 1985: pl. 65: 9-10. 48 Salles J.F. 1978-79: 84, pl. VI: 3. 371</page><page sequence="34">horns decorateci with oblique incisions. Impressed circles show eyes and nostrils, and were placed also in three rows on the forehead. The diameter of the lid is 13.3 cm. There is an anthropomorphic figurine made in a rather primitive style. It represents the head and part of the bust of a iemale. The shoulders are fiat and a quite massive neck ends with a T-shaped 'projection' representing an elongated face (broken); an elaborate hair-dressing, in the form of a fiat chignon decorated with short line incisions, is shown on the back side. This 'grotesque' figurine was made from light reddish fine paste with traces of pinkish-white slip on the exterior. Its height is 4.3 cm, the thickness of the body is 0.6 cm. It should probably interpreted as décoration on top of the vessel's rim. Stylistically, the ram's head décoration finds parallels in the lids crowned with animai figures discovered in the Iron Age II monuments in Muweilah and Bithnah (U.A.E.), which were interpreted as parts of incense burners49. Animal figurines as terminations of lid handles and décoration of rims of ceramic vessels are know from the Iron Age context in Khatt and Bithnah50. 4.6 Shell objects A few objects found in the top strata of the site were made from différent kinds of ma rine shells. Among them there are pendants made from the Cypraeidae and Marginellidae species (they were made by the fracture or wear-and-tear of the back of the shells)51, a disc pendant made from unspecified shell (diameter is 2.5 cm), beads or buttons made from the apex of shells of Conidae family (diameter 1.1-1.2 cm)52. An oval-shaped shell plaque with a curved profile présents traces of working on the edges. There is a graffito in the form of a fish on the concave face. The size of the object is 4.0x5.8x0.6 cm. A half of mollusc shell Chlamis Townsendi has traces of secondary burning along the edges of internai surface. It was probably used as oil lamp (the size is 12.6x12.3 cm). A fragmentary T-shaped handle of a knife (?) was made from a fossil shell. It has a central hole for attachment. The size of the object is 2.4x3.0x1.0 cm. 49 Cf.

Discussion The results of the three campaigns of the IMTO at Salut enable us to draw some pre liminary and rather general conclusions. 5.1 Stratigraphy and structures The fortress was built on the liât top of the naturai outcrop. From the very beginning (the lst construction phase) it was a very well fortified stronghold surrounded by a mas sive stone wall built using a technique combining a clay 'core' and stone external 'skin'. The corridor-like premises were located along the outer defence walls. The presence of the staircase shows that at least two-storage structures constituted the buildings of the lst construction phase. Apparently they were destroyed by fire and their ruins used for con structing the massive platform on which the buildings of the 2nd construction phase were erected. It seems quite probable that the enlargement of the defence wall was also made during this rénovation. The entire structure of Building 1 (the 2nd construction phase) looks rather symmetrical with a perpendicular axis oriented roughly in north-south and east-west directions. It is diffïcult to make any precise statements about the functional use of the structures discovered, but the presence of the columned hall with an elaborate en trance, which was quite unusual for a dwelling, and the set of finds should be mentioned. There are votive objects such as bronze snakes (one complete and one fragmented), a miniature axe, a finial (?), personal ornaments (belt rings, earrings, beads and pendants), bronze tools (razors, hoes, awls, needles etc.). The top layer (the 3rd construction phase) revealed horizontal surfaces, floors, pave ments and the remains of stone foundations of small circular structures. Constructively they are not connected with the preceding mud-brick structures and represent the period of late re-occupation of the site. 5.2 Chronology The foundation of Salut goes back to the Early Iron Age period, i.e. to the late 2nd mil lennium BC, and the site was occupied till at least the late 9th or the early 8th centuries BC. The preliminary analyses of the pottery and other material show its close similarity with Rumeilah and other Early Iron Age sites in the Eastern Arabia53. The available ra diocarbon dates from différent strata of our excavations confirm this conclusion (see Table /). On the other hand it should be noted that rather 'early' C14 dates contradict the presence of some diagnostic pottery forms, first of ali the so-called "bridge-spouted" jars and small carinated bowls, which, on the bases with Iranian comparisons, are dated usu ally slightly 'later'54. 53 Cf.: Boucharlat R., Lombard P. 1985: 44-73. 54 See: Kroll St. 1991: 315-320. 373</page><page sequence="36">Table 1 Lab Provenience Radiocarbon age BP ## GX-31550 US 20, ash layer above the bedrock 3130±80 GX-31773 US16floor 2900±50 GX-31547 US6 3110±60 GX-31549 US13floor 3030±50 GX-31548 US 12floor, fire-place 2910±50 GX-31546 US3floor 2760±70 GX-31771 US23floor 2940±70 GX-31770 US 1, wood from the top of the monumental platform 3060±70 GX-31772 US36, charcoal from mediaeval pit 360±40 Lab Provenience Radiocarbon âge BP ## GX-31550 US 20, ash layer above the bedrock 3130±80 GX-31773 US16floor 2900±50 GX-31547 US6 3110±60 GX-31549 US13floor 3030±50 GX-31548 US 12floor, fire-place 2910±50 GX-31546 US3floor 2760±70 GX-31771 US23floor 2940±70 GX-31770 US 1, wood from the top of the monumental platform 3060±70 GX-31772 US36, charcoal from mediaeval pit 360±40 The end of the Early Iron Age structures at Salut was, apparently, violent: little fewer than two dozen bronze arrowheads were found in the ruins of the building assigned to the Salut 2 phase. Many of them were damaged at the tip as though once they have been fired at stone walls. Such finds could be interpreted as the evidence of a military siege of the stronghold of Salut probably somewhere in the late 9th - early 8th centuries BC. Diagnostic pottery shards (the so-called "late sgraffiato" wares, "Abbasid" blue glazed wares) give the possible date for the mediaeval occupation of the site between 8th-9th and 14th-16th centuries AD55. It was, no doubt, the re-occupation of the old site, which was apparently sporadic. The presence of the so-called "Bahia pottery" should be connected with existence of the ruins of the modem building clearly visible on the edge of the east em slope of the hill. 5.3 Historical implication The discovery and established chronology of the Salut settlement is of very great im portance for the history of Oman in the late 2nd - early lst millennia BC. This is one of the largest Early Iron Age sites with an extensive occupation and one of the best devel oped fortification Systems known so far on the Omani Peninsula. It can be remembered that, according to Neo-Assyrian and Achaemenid written sources, the peninsula was known as "the land of Qade (Kade)"56. Moreover, the so-called Ishtar Slab inscription from Nineveh, in which the receipt of a tribute sent to Assurbanipal around 640 BC is recorded, in Unes 132-133 mentions the arrivai of "Pade, king of land of Kade, who dwelt in the city of Iske..."57. Some scholars identify the name of Pade's capital Is/Iz-ki/qi-e with the well-known town of Izki in the Omani interior, a town considered by local tradì 55 Cf. Whitcomb D.S. 1975: 127-128. 56 See: Potts D.T. 1990a: 393-395; for a more detailed discussion see: Potts D.T. 1985: 81-83. 57 Cited according to Potts D.T. 1990a: 393. 374</page><page sequence="37">tion to be the oldest in Oman58. But as we know from the results of the archaeological survey conducted by P. Costa59, there are no significant archaeological remains of any Early Iron Age settlement in the area of the modem Izki, which, from an archaeological point of view, could be a capital mentioned in Assyrian sources. It could of course be an exaggeration to consider Salut as the capital of Qade = Oman, especially before any large-scale archaeological excavation has taken place at the site, but such a possibility should be kepi in mind. The memory of the importance of Salut is strong in Omani tradition. Wilkinson60 re lates the legend of the trip of Sulayman bin Dawud, an hypostasis of King Solomon, in Oman. The king was being carried by the winds across to Oman where he saw the castle of Salut. Sulayman ordered the spirits to investigate. They reported that its sole occupant was an eagle who said that he and his forebears had been living there for 800 years, and ali that time the castle had been inhabited. There is another problem of the history of pre-Islamic Oman on which future excava tions at Salut can shed a light. There is an Arabie source which may have some hearing on the question of a Persian (Achaemenid) presence in the Oman peninsula. Most of the first book of the Kashf al-Gumma describes the conflict between Malik bin Fahm, the first of the Azd to move from Yemen to Oman, and the Persians. The Persians were based at Sohar, on the coast of the Gulf, and after rejecting Malik's request to settle in Oman, they marched with a force of 30,000-40,000 men and éléphants to the plain of Salut, near Nizwa, where they were defeated by Malik. Persian reinforcements failed to prevent a further victory by Malik, and after a second defeat, "the remnant of the Persian army em barked in their ships and passed across the sea to Persia". It should be pointed out that Kashf al-Gumma describes that Malik bin Fahm "found the Persians holding Oman for the king Dara, son of Dara, son of Bahman". As has been suggested by some scholars (J.C. Wilkinson, D.T. Potts), the name of "Dara bin Dara bin Bahman" is "a mythical construct which combines the names of Bahman, son of Isfandiar, one of the early Persian mythical figures described by Firdowsi, and Dara, as Darius III, Alexander the Great's unsuccessful opponent", and that the Achaemenid presence in Oman is quite probable61. It has to be noted also that in this case the legendary Azd migration to Oman should be dated to Achaemenid period, at least several hundred years earlier than usually suggested. Bearing in mind ali these data, we have to closely examine the established chronology of the Salut fortress, and in this respect Iranian analogies for pottery assem blages from Salut are quite interesting. Our investigations show that the fortress did not remain isolated but was the core of a wide Early Iron Age agricultural oasis with a subordinate settlement (Salut 2) and a so phisticated irrigation system (falaj). The early date (late 2nd - early lst millennia BC) for the construction and usage of the falaj system in Oman is of special importance. It strongly backs the theory of the first appearance of such irrigation constructions on 58 Cf.

The artefacts (stone and bronze tools, pottery vessels, votive objects etc.) discovered during our excavations as well as the construction technique of unearthed mud-brick and stone structures of the Salut fortress are very similar, indeed almost identical, to what we have from contemporary sites along the coast of the Gulf, in the U.A.E. interior and east ern Oman, from the sites like Rumeilah and Hili 14 (the oasis of al-Ain), Shimal, Qarn Bint Saud, Dibba, al-Qusais, Lizq and the sites in the Samad area. From an archaeologi cal point of view there are strong grounds to speak about cultural unity of the ancient population of the whole of Eastern Arabia in the late 2nd - lst millennia BC, about the sin gle cultural province, in archaeological terms, which included also Dhofar région (Ain Humran and Shisur). The presence of two Iron Age sites, Salut fortress at the very end of the irrigation sys tem and the Salut 2 settlement at the end of falaj shafts and at the beginning of the open channel, clearly demonstrate that we are dealing with a vast agriculturai oasis flourishing in the late 2nd - early lst millennia BC. There is no doubt that ali these monuments - set tlement, fortress and the falaj system - are contemporary and constitute a single integrat ed complex. Most probably, the Salut fortress was an administrative centre of the ancient oasis and/or a residence of a locai ruler. Apparently, the falaj system was renewed several times, in the mediaeval period and in modem times. 376</page><page sequence="39">Bibliographical référencés Al Tikriti W.Y. 1989.
