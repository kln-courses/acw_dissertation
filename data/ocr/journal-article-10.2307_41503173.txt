<plain_text><page sequence="1">Manggeng and Datu Merpati by A. H. Hill, M.A., D.Phil ( Oxon .) (Received November, 1 954) This paper offers a critical examination of the stories asso- ciated with the names of Manggeng and Datu Merpati, and tries to answer the questions, When did they live and what did they &lt;lo? The story of Manggeng, the ancestor of the Land Dayaks who ran away and became a territorial chief in Java, is a most persistent theme in Land Dayak folklore. Father P. Howes has spent many years of his working life as a priest among the Land Dayaks of the First Division, Sarawak. He has a considerable knowledge of their folk-tales, the more important of which he has collected in a booklet Shun Nyamba Nang. His version of the Manggeng legend from Senah has the mark of authenticity, if indeed such a claim can ever be made about the hotch-potch of oral tradition which often furnishes the only clue to important details in the history of an illiterate people. An interest in Malaysian folklore and the privilege of being allowed to share some of Fr. Howe's enthusiasm for local tradition are my reasons for offering comment on the Manggeng story. Was Manggeng a historical figure? Probably we shall never know for certain. Let us first examine the evidence presented by the story itself. So far as I can ascertain Fr. Howes s version is the third detailed account to appear in print. The first was collected by N. Denison in 1875 also from Senah1, the second bv Boland and Harrisson in 1949 from a village called in the story Labak Mengkebu, the modern Emperoh Gerong2a. Both these places are in the same area, close to the old gold mine at Pengkalan Empat. Both Denison's and Bolanďs informants were obviously respected elders of their villages. The writers give verbatim translations of their words. Incidentally Fr. Howes had not read either of these two accounts when he wrote his version, which for all that it is a synthesis of a story he has heard related on many occasions, bears to a much greater extent the marks of the skilled raconteur. The climaxes occur in proper sequence, the points are well taken as the story unfolds. Using material common to the Denison-Boland version (I) and Fr. Howes' s version (II) we can reconstruct a basic story. It has two parts. ( i ) Manggeng becomes a chief in Java. Manggeng was a Land Dayak who lived along the Sarawak River (Simpang Kiri) -with his wife and one small son named Jawih. One day Mang- Joumal Malayan Branch [Vol. XXVIII, Pt. I,</page><page sequence="2">Maiiggeng and Datu Mer pati 149 geng, irritated beyond endurance by his young child's cries for attention while he was working in the house, hit Jawih over the head with a heavy club. The mother, coming in and seeing blood streaming from a deep wound on her son's forehead, was furious and loudly cursed Manggeng when she heard the reason. On a sudden impulse, in fear or in anger, Manggeng left home and made off down the river. On the way to the coast he met a Javanese and together they sailed for Java. Near the place where they landed was a village which was troubled by marauding tigers (a). The Rajah allowed Manggeng to stay in the village, and Manggeng devised a plan to get rid of the tigers (b). By setting spring traps along jungle paths he and his comrades soon killed them all. This tour de force so awed the villagers that they wanted Manggeng as their chief, and the angry Rajah in the hopes of getting rid of him ordered him to undergo trials of strength and skill (c). In the first he had to cut through a piece of wax with his hunting-knife using only the pressure of his wrist. This he succeeded in doing by heating his knife in a fire or in the sun, after feigning a cold fever so that he was left alone for a while before the test. In the next test Manggeng was required to compete against the local champion in hurling spears or firing darts from a blowpipe. In either case he won by a simple subterfuge undetected by the crowd of spectators (d). Acknow- ledging defeat the Rajah absconded and Manggeng reigned in his stead. (ii) Manggengs son ñnds his father in Java. Many years passed. Jawih had grown to manhood. Yielding to his persistent •questioning his mother at last told him how his tather had left her, and how it was rumoured that he had gone to Java and become Rajah. Resolving to find Manggeng he and a companion named Tunya set out through the jungle. Together they crossed the sea and reached the same place where long ago Manggeng had landed in Java (e). Their request to see the Rajah was at first treated with suspicion. The palace servants chased them away while the Rajah was told of the arrival of the two strangers. But Manggeng came out to see them and subsequently recognized his son from the long scar on his forehead (f). They asked Manggeng to return with them to Borneo, but he could not leave his wife and his kingdom. Instead he loaded their boat with presents for his homeland (g) and the pair of them returned to Borneo without him (h). Notes : - (a) I mentions no travelling companion, and says that Manggeng made friends with a man in the village in Java. (b) II gives the story a romantic turn with the Rajah's promise of his throne and his wife to anyone who succeeded in killing all the tigers. 1955] Royal Asiatic Society .</page><page sequence="3">150 Dr. A. H. Hill (c) In I the Rajah's wife is not mentioned at all. 1Г exaggerates the scale of Manggeng's beneficence - there were: "hordes of tigers troubling the country" - and the Rajah's Pied- Piper treatment of him reads like a modern twist to an old story. (d) The improbability of the scales being so fortuitously weighed in favour of the stranger evidently did not strike the teller of II. The appeal to hypnosis - the King of the Butter- flies episode in II - is untypical of the story as a whole and may be a late accretion. (e) For the second time II mentions meeting a Javanese on the way to the coast. I denies that any rumour of Manggeng's fate had reached his wife. It says that the decision of the two men to make for Java was taken only when, after travelling; through Sarawak for some time, they reached the sea and saw unknown land in the distance. (f) This point which neatly ties up the story is omitted altogether from I, which merely says that the Rajah knew from the truth of the story the young man told that he must be his son. (g) II suggests a more lavish scale of philanthropy - a fleet of ships laden with the costliest finery and objets d'art. (h) I says that Jawih and Tunya were persuaded to stay on in Java, and gives a different reason for their return to Sarawak after some months. Manggeng reluctantly agreed to their marry- ing in Java. But when their eligibility for marriage was put to- the test, by a dog eating morsels of rice placed on their buttocks,. Tunya failed. This was a sure sign that he was descended from animals. This discouraged Jawih and they both decided to go home. Version I then concludes with a third part to the story which explains Tunya's animal descent. Two of his ancestors, man and wife, had a rice-clearing, but the growing rice was constantly ravaged by pigs. So the man took a spear and waited on the edge of the clearing until the herd passed by. Among the herd was a big white pig and this the man transfixed with his spear so* that it remained in the animal's body. The wounded pig bounded off into the jungle carrying the spear with it. The man could not afford the loss of a valuable weapon, so the next morning early he rose and followed the pig's tracks into the jungle. By and by he came to a village. He asked a woman he met why everything was so quiet and was told that the village was under a taboo because the Rajah, who was the woman's father, was very sick. He went to the head-house and there found the Rajah lying on his back in agony. He looked closely and saw, sticking in the wound, the iron end of his own spear. Taking hold of the spear he pulled it out, and very soon the wound healed and the Rajah was well again. In gratitude the Rajah asked the Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XXVIII, Pt. Ir</page><page sequence="4">Manggeng and Datu Merpati 151 man to marry his daughter, and this after some hesitation, for he already had a wife, he did. One day the man was out in the jungle collecting fruit. But as fast as he threw the fruits from a tree down to the ground they were taken away by pigs. Angry at this he went back to the village and told his wife, who by this time was pregnant. But she told him not to worry as the fruit had already been brought back to the village by their friends, and she pointed to a pile of fruit in the corner of the room. Then he realized that all the villagers were pigs and that they assumed this form whenever they left the village. Soon his wife gave birth to her child, whom they named Mapu. When he reached manhood Mapu married a woman who had come from a big grub which he had found on a jungle track and kept in a bamboo slung to the rafters of his house. Their son was the grandfather of Tunya, the one who was Jawih's contemporary. Over how wide ari area is the general theme of the Manggeng story found? In his preamble to II Fr Howes says that "every village. .. .along the Sarawak River (Simpang Kiri) and in the mountainous country on either side of it" has a version of it. As Harrisson says there is great similarity between Manggeng and Menggin of the Sea Dayaks whose journey across the sea was responsible for much Iban folklore2b. Dr Geddes in his sociolo- gical survey of the Gedong area, where Bidayuh groups are found between Land and Sea Dayak districts, says that Manggeng s name appears in ritual songs. Speaking of the Land Dayaks, Fr Howes tells me that the Sanggat is a pantun sung during the taking of wild honey. At the foot of the tree, when about to drive in pegs, the singer begins: - This tree has been left untouched. Left unharmed by our grandmothers in the centre of the farmland, Left standing by our grandfathers in the garden of yams at the foot of the mountain, As a young plant it grew up like a rat's tail: Its roots grew and spread as far afield as Java. Harrisson mentions a related story from a village near Serian3. Four brothers went to Java. The eldest, Sijau, died there and returned to Serian in the form of a frog. The frog-god still guards his people. Fr. Howes has given me more details of this story. "At Kampong Gayu a small figure, said to be like a frog, is kept in a small hut and venerated as the guna of the Pinyawah family of Land Dayaks. When after Sijau's death the three remaining brothers attempted to return, their boat would net move until they had disinterred Sijau to bring his remains along with them. At home again Sijau appeared in a dream to the youngest brother and told him that he would look after the Land Dayaks of the district as long as they made him offerings. He 1955] Royal Asiatic Society .</page><page sequence="5">152 Dr. A. H. Hill then turned into the metal figure, said to be like gold, which has been tended ever since. Only four elders are allowed to tend. Sijau. He is wrapped in a mat and taken down to the river for a bath once in four years. The elders are not supposed to look.. at him, so how anyone knows that he is 'like golď I don't know!" Very brief mention must be made of one more Land Dayak story because of its connection with the animal ancestory of Tunya, the friend of Manggeng s son. In the words of Fr. Howes: "Kiau long ago was born of the union of Manyu with a Sikung mountain spirit. When he had reached manhood he went to Java, hearing that Javanese girls were very beautiful. He had many adventurers before returning with a wife and riches. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren seem to have been in the habit of giving birth to birds, animals, fish and beings who turned into stone - shocked, probably, by the rest of their relations!" In the story of Manggeng we have a folk-tale known to everyone, with only minor variations of detail, within a small and racially homogeneous area of Western Borneo. Wider variants are known to peripheral dwellers. Can we trace any parallels in the folk-tales of neighbouring countries? Significantly no. In fifteen years of indulging an interest in the folklore of South East Asia I have found nothing which resembles at all closely either of the two main parts of the story; that is to say, which has for its theme the departure of a man from his homeland for Java (or any other country), his appointment as a territorial chief after ridding the countryside of marauding animals and per- forming feats of strength to test his fitness, his discovery years later by his son, and his presentation of rich gifts to his own people. Tales of warriors undergoing trials of strength, for instance to escape bondage at the hands of a wicked ruler or to marry a princess and her inheritance, are common enough. I have found them in Kelantan and in south Siam. A composite story I have written elsewhere illustrates the usual theme4. Generally the successful hero is gratuitously supplied with supernatural aids or the animal kingdom comes' to his rescue in anthropomorphic guise. Manggeng has only his native wit and his friends to help- him. The King of the Butterflies episode of II sounds like a syncretistic echo of Hindu mythology, the demi-god riding on his vahana. There are plenty oí spear-throwing and blowpipe con- tests in Malaysian folklore. The tale of Badang the Strong Man. of Singapore is told in the Sějarah MélayuV But he was the local champion who honoured his king by beating the foreigners. The best authenticated of Manggeng's trials, the cutting of wax with a knife, is so far as I know unique. Only the concluding episode of I has any close parallels outside Sarawak. Stories of pig ancestry are common in Malaysia. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XXVIII, Pt. I,.</page><page sequence="6">Manggeng and Datu Merpati 153 I. H. N. Evans working among the Kintak Bong negritos of Upper Perak in 1935 collected a tale of a negrito who hit a pig with an arrow, then went to a "pig-village" and cured a wounded man6. The similarity is striking. A king with a pig's head who resisted the armies of Majapahit is an element in Balinese mythology7. If Manggeng sailed from Sambas or some other point on the coast of what is now Indonesian West Borneo and followed the coastline for some way to the south his most likely landfall beyond the islands of Bangka and Billiton would be West Java. But his journey is conjectural. On a more westerly course he would have reached the islands of the Lingga and Riau archipelagos or some point near the southern end of Sumatra or the Malay Peninsula. Fr. Howes tells me "It is quite common, when a character dis- appears from a story, to be told that 'he sailed away to Java'. He is not then mentioned again". In Malaysian folklore the word Java is often used to mean a kind of Eldorado, rather like saying "....and they lived happily ever after". Let us take a brief look at one or two tales from other territories. I. H. N. Evans has recorded a fable about the origin of the Bajau people8. A woman named Dayang Bulan and her three brothers, dismissed by an elder brother after a week's truancy in the mouth of the Johore River, set sail for the Borneo coast. At Kudat they were met by a Brunei pengiran who married Dayang Bulan. "From them the Brunei rajas are descended". One brother remained in North Borneo, the other became raja at Sulu. This story has some feature in common with Rutter's account of Bajau origins9, in which a Johore princess, Dayang Ayesha, packed off to the court of the Sultan of Sulu, is abducted on the way by a Brunei prince. These stories are clearly connected with the Datu Merpati legend, versions of which Harrisson 3b has found among the Dayaks of Santubong, Sibayau, the Sadong, Bau and other places, and also among the Kedayans and Melanaus. A nobleman of Java was driven out to Johore where he married the Sultan's daughter. Later a storm at sea took them to the coast of Dutch Borneo. In a very full version of the story from the Sadong area Roberts10 gives the subsequent adventures of Datu Merpati. He and his wife settled at Tanjong Sipang, but while he was away she and her infant daughter Dayang Bulan were abducted by a Samarahan raja. Killing her captor in an a mok she escaped with the child to Brunei. By the time Datu Merpati found her Dayang Bulan had grown into a beautiful woman and was about to be married to a son of the Sultan of Johore who had been captured through a trick played on him in a boat by a band of Brunei pirates. He sent Datu Merpati and his wife to rule Sarawak. Stories of the foreign antecedents of various Borneo 1955] Royal Asiatic Society.</page><page sequence="7">154 Dr. A. H. Hill peoples are legion. There is an appendix to Rajah James Brook's journal written about 1844 which says of Borneo "Bruni, the capital, is stated to have been peopled by the Orang Laut from Johore; Sarawak from Java; Sadong, probably the same; Samarahan from Pegu ! Linga from the island and kingdom of that name, corruptly called Lingin; Sarebus from Menangkabau in Sumatra . ..."n The Merpati legend bears little superficial resemblance to the story of Manggeng. Yet they are distantly related in topic. In both the central figure is a giant in mythological stature who stands patriarchally (Fr. Howes: "as Abranam in the Old Testa- ment" ) at the dawn of Borneo history. Each of them makes a journey across the sea and becomes a local chieftain. Each is associated with Java. Moreover there is a rough coincidence of period. Harrisson3b says that in the Sibayau version Datu (Mer) Pati emerges 15 or 16 generations back. In the Sarawak Malay genealogy published by Mohammed Yusuf Shibli12 Datu Temenggong who lives in Kuching is shown as fourteenth in the direct line of descent from Datu Merpati. In Fr. Howes's genea- logy of Manggeng a boy of 16 is now the sixteenth in line and this agrees with what Denison was told3. The Manggeng story avoids those naive flights of imagination which characterize the animistic myths of Malaysian aborigines, the epic tales which come from Vedic India, episodes from the works of the great Islamic teachers of Arabia and Persia. Malay- sian folklore rings the changes on a comparatively small number of original stories taken from primitive beliefs about gods of the thunder, lightning and rain, the demonology of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the apocryphal deeds of Alexander the Great. The ingredients of the Manggeng story strongly suggest that as summarized above it contains a great measure of histo- rical truth. If we allow twenty-five years to a generation Manggeng must have been alive between 1500 and 1550. The date found from Javanese written sources by Raffles for the fall of Maja- pahit, the great Hindu kingdom of Java, was 147513a. But Krom14 has proposed a later date, probably within a decade or two of 1500, and his views on this important period in the history of the Far East seem to have been accepted by modern scholars. In any case the empire of Siva-worshippers did not suffer a sudden spectacular collapse. Over a period of a hundred years or more it was worn down by Muslim missionaries and traders who intro- duced the new faith more often by peaceful persuasion than by the sword. As early as 1292 Marco Polo found Islam established in Perlak, an east Sumatran state which lay on the fringe of Majapahiťs furthest influence up the Straits of Malacca. The Malacca rulers had been converted to Islam by 1420. But the Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XXVIII, Pt. I,.</page><page sequence="8">Manggeng and Datu Merpati 155 Portuguese found a Hindu ruler in Bantam, in western Java at the centre of the Majapahit kingdom, when they first visited the port in 151113I). During the greater part of the fifteenth century Majapahit had been the chief bulwark against the east- ward spread of Islam. When towards its end the barriers began to break down the ensuing period must have been one of inces- sant war, turmoil and religious strife. It would not have been impossible for a stranger skilled in hunting and trapping animals to persuade the local people that he was their benefactor and set up a petty chieftaincy on his own. When was "Indian" influence first felt in West Borneo? There is little evidence to support Banks's view that "there was in the sixth or seventh century a Paliava invasion from Madras, doubtless via Java"15. The objects he quotes, finds of Hindu images, are no less typical of much later Indian influences. And the spate of Sanskrit words which have found their way into Javanese, a process of assimilation which began from Paliava sources, are conspicuously lacking in Dayak languages. There is little evidence either of Srivijaya contacts.* In the list of countries subject to Majapahit given in the Nagarakretagama, a Javanese poem written in 1365, there is no mention of any part of the island of Borneo. Hughes-Hallet says that "according to Javanese records a Javanese force expelled Sulu marauders from Brunei in 1368" and "Brunei is mentioned as one of the countries conquered during the reign of Angka Wijaya. . . ."1Ga. Hughes-Hallet does not give the source of his information, and I am unable to check his first statement. An approximate date for the reign of Angka Wijaya can be found. Pires writing in 1515 mentions Pate Onus (Pateh Yunus, the Muslim ruler of Demak) as "a great warrior in Java. . » .who came to the fight in the year fifteen hundred and twelve"17. His brother-in-law was "Pate Rodim" (Raden Patah) and his grand- father had been "the most famous lord of Java", who about forty or forty-five years earlier had cunningly killed the Pate of Japara. In his History of Java13c. Raffles quotes Javanese texts which lead to the presumption that Radén Patah was the grandson of Angka Wijaya. A tentative date round about 1450 may therefore be assigned to Angka Wijaya, the Betara Browijaya of Majapahit and its last real ruler before the break-up started in Java. One of the texts quoted by Raffles speaks of.Andaya Ningrat, a famous commander of the Majapahit armies who had secured the sub- mission of "all the rajas of Sabrang (Borneo and the islands * I am considering only direct cultural contacts between the Dayak parts of West Borneo and Java or Malaya. The Sambas antiquities prove a much earlier "Indianization" of the coast. The Kutai inscription proves that there was an "Indian" settlement on the Kutai river as early as the 5th century A.D., but this is in East Borneo. 1955] Royal Asiatic Society.</page><page sequence="9">156 Dr. A.

The chronology of the text is confused, for later on it mentions- attempts to curb the political power of the war-chief by Gaja Mada and the "Prince of Majapahit" (Hayam Wuruk), who- ruled the kingdom in 1330 during a period of earlier ascendancy. But if Hughes-Hallet is right Brunei, and other parts of Borneo, had come under the sway of Majapahit by 1440-50. The period of its sovereignty over Brunei must have been very short. There is an interesting link between Johore and Brunei of this period, perpetuated in the Brunei annals, the Salasilah or Těrsilah. The ruler of Brunei, Alak Bertata, sent two of his captains to the Johore court. There, aided by a storm which blew up while the party were on a pleasure cruise, they abducted the Íohore ecame ruler's the most daughter cherished and wife brought of Alak her back Bertata. to Brunei. Accounts She of ecame the most cherished wife of Alak Bertata. Accounts of what happened then are widely divergent. But it seems that after representations and sorties from Johore honour on both sides was satisfied. Through the instrumentality of the Sultan of Johore, Alak Bertata embraced Islam and took the title of Sultan Mohammed. This story is obviously related to that of Datu Merpati. Alak Bertata's reign can be roughly dated. His great-grandson, or possibly his grand-nephew, was Sultan Bolkiah, "a renowned sea rover who voyaged to Java and Malacca and made conquests in Borneo, the Philippines and Sulu. . . It was in 1521 that Magellan's party, soon after its leader's death, reached Brunei. Its historian Pigafetta describes the ruler's court, the large carpeted hall with attendants: dressed in silk and cloth-of-gold, the warriors lining the roads armed to the teeth. "That city is entirely built in salt water, except the houses of the king and certain chiefs There is a large brick wall in front of the king's house with towers like a fort, in which were mounted fifty-six bronze pieces, and six of iron . . . .That king is a Moro and his name is Rajah Siripada [Raja Seri Paduka]"16b.. This is probably a description of Sultan Bolkiah. If so the first Muslim ruler of Brunei was a contemporary of Angka Wijaya. Banks18 and Harrisson3 have both described Indian influ- ences in Borneo. Harrisson says: "It is probable that West Borneo only came into full Majapahit influence towards the middle of the 14th century. By the end of the century that empire was crumbling. Before this, however, Brunei had become the northern centre of administration. .. .From this it was an easy carry-over to become the area headquarters of Islam. The transition does not seem to have been a difficult one." Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XXVIII, Pt.

Howes says, few of the treasures, fine batik cloths, richly decorated, jewels and gold, now remain. The earthenware jar, interesting though it is, tells us little. It is clearly a drinking vessel, but according to the Curator of the Sarawak Museum The "Manggeng" Vendi. The decoration is restricted to (i) the lip of the- rim, two parallel lines made by a pointed stick, with a single row of inverted -'V"s between them, and (ii) below the base of the neck, two irregular lines made by a pointed stick, with a row of inverted "V"s between them, and one of triangular indentations just above the upper line. nothing like it is known in Borneo pottery. It is not easy to telí if it was turned on a wheel: probably not. The wide mouth with its crude incised pattern and the squat base suggest an Indian provenance, of no very great antiquity. The other remaining objects bear better witness to the story: the two gold clasps, said to be ear-ornaments; the gold necklace and locket. Elaborately wrought ornaments in precious metals, with patterns characteristic of the Majapahit period, have beci* found all over Malaysia, cf. the flexible gold armlets and other objects dug up on Fort Canning Hill, in Singapore, in 192819~ 1955] Royal Asiatic Society.</page><page sequence="11">158 Dr. A.

It was shown to Denison, who describes it as looking "like a number of small snakes linked together". Tentatively I offer the following conclusions. Manggeng and Datu Merpati are historical figures whose lives tradition has distorted and to some extent confused. Manggeng became a territorial chief somewhere in west Java at about the time when Islam had established itself as the religion of the country, sav 1500-1525. Datu Merpati, himself a convert to Islam, founded a •colony of Malays in Sarawak, probably between 1450 and 1475. References (1) Denison, N. 1'875 Sarawak Gazette , October 1875.
