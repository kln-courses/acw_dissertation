<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES OF THE HEBREW SECTION A DONATION FOR HEROD'S TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM BY Β. Isaac (pp. 1-4; PI. κ, 1) A Greek inscription found among debris in the recent excava tions south of the Temple Mount records a benefaction made by Paris (or Sparis) son of Aceson, presumably a foreign (Jewish) resident at Rhodes, for a pavement somewhere on or near the Temple Mount. This may well have been the pave ment of the southern court. The date is year 20 of a king who cannot be other than Herod, i.e. 18/17 BCE, precisely the period in which the Temple was rebuilt. The inscription may support the earlier of the two dates given by Josephus for commencement of the work. This is a rare record of a dona tion made for the building of the Temple and raises the ques tion whether such private benefactions were not more impor tant as means of financing the work than Josephus would have us think. THE CHURCH OF MARY MAGDALENE AND ITS QUARTER by D. Bahat (pp. 5-7; PL ב) Amongst the churches of Crusader Jerusalem, special atten tion should be given to the Church of St. Mary Magdalene, the main church of the Orthodox communities of the city under the Latin Kingdom. Although built in the Early Arab period, it underwent many changes and repairs, including the con struction of an adjoining monastery, until the complex was finally completed in 1125. The church was well known to scholars until it was completely destroyed during the First World War. Recently, development work carried out in the Old City of Jerusalem led to the discovery of the remains of the monastery cloister. In several Crusader sources, a postern in an inner city wall is named after this church. This wall, passing near the chinch, appears on modern maps depicting the city in Cru sader times. It is suggested that the topographical features of the area of the church preclude the existence of such a wall. The postern was probably located on the site of today's Herod's Gate. A further outer wall is in evidence at several points outside the present northern wall of Jerusalem, and thus the present wall was actually an inner wall at that time. EXCAVATIONS IN THE CHAPEL OF ST. VARTAN IN THE HOLY SEPULCHRE, JERUSALEM by Μ. Broshi and G. Barkay (pp. 8-20; Pis.ו-ג) Clearance work conducted by the Armenian Orthodox Pa triarchate behind (i.e. east of) St. Helena's Chapel in the Holy Sepulchre revealed a space created by an Iron Age quarry. The work (directed by Bishop Gureigh Kapikian and supervised by M. Broshi between November 1975 and February 1976), re vealed remains of various periods — ranging from the end of the 8th century BCE to the 12th century CE. A beaten earth floor and small finds (pottery, terra cotta figurines and an ostracon) represent a squatters' occupation of roughly the last century of the First Temple period (late 7th-early 6th centu ries BCE). This floor, and other sites in which occupational remains were found, signify an extensive extra-mural suburb of that period. The later remains include Hadrianic, Constant inian and Crusader architectural fragments. A graffito of a ship and an accompanying Latin inscription are dated to the time of the erection of the Constant!nian basilica, ca. 330 CE. THE " FIRST WALL" OF JERUSALEM DURING THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD. AN ARCHITECTURAL-CHRONOLOGICAL NOTE by Η. Geva (pp. 21-39; Pis.1-2 ,ח-ז) Since the end of the previous century, several large segments of the "First Wall" around the south-western hill of ancient Jerusalem have been revealed. This accumulated archaeolo gical evidence, together with the description by Josephus, makes the First Wall the best known of the three defensive walls of the city at the end of the Second Temple period. Evidence from the excavations has also clarified the fact that this wall originated in the late First Temple period (8th-7th centuries BCE), as verified by Josephus (Wars V, 143). The Hasmoneans rebuilt this wall around the south-western hill, along the same line, and there were successive reconstruc tions until the wall as destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. Three major phases of construction can be defined within the remains of the First Wall. These architectural phases were already identified by Johns along the section of the wall which he revealed in the courtyard of the Citadel. The present paper demonstrates that these building phases are typical of the entire line of the First Wall around the</page><page sequence="2">66* ENGLISH SUMMARIES south-western hill, basing on the archaeological data accumu lated in recent excavations. The first phase is characterized by the use of roughly dressed stones laid in courses of headers and built in a typically Hel lenistic masonry style. The archaeological evidence from the excavations carried out all around the south-western hill unco vered no intensive occupational level earlier than the second half of the 2nd century BC. This fact, together with historical data, enables the constructions of the First Wall here to be attributed to Simeon or to John Hyrcanus I. This construction phase extensively incorporated remains of the fortifications from the end of the First Temple period. The second phase is characterized by the use of large ashlars carefully dressed with margins on all four sides and a protrud ing, rough central boss. This typically Hellenistic masonry was generally laid in alternating courses of headers and stretchers. During this phase the wall received a new aspect, due to the extensive new construction work. Stratigraphically, in relation to the two other phases, this phase is of the later Hasmonean period. The third phase is characterized by the use of large ashlar stones with precise, combed margins on all four sides and a flat, chiselled boss. This phase should be dated to the time of Herod the Great, who also inserted three huge towers into the line of the First Wall (one of which still stands, known today as "David's Tower"). THE TRUMPETER'S INSCRIPTION FROM THE TEMPLE MOUNT by A. Demsky (pp. 40-42; PI. 2 ,א) A new reading is suggested for the incomplete last word of the lebet hattiqiah inscription discovered in 1970. This word, usually read [...]להב, has alternately been completed [,להכ[ה להכ[ל] and preferably [להכ[ריז. Almost thirty years ago, N. Avigad observed that in the Herodian period alternate forms of the same letter appear within a single monumental or ossuary inscription. Conse quently, it is here proposed that the third letter of the broken word is not a kaf but rather a secondary form of bet. In the light of the obvious contextual relationship to Mishnah Sukkah 5, 5, where the trumpet blasts of the Temple are enumerated (particularly those for calling in the Sabbath), it is here suggested that the inscription should be completed .לבית התקיעה להנ[דיל ביז קדש לחול] DECORATED LAMPS WITH HUMAN FACES FROM THE EXCAVATIONS IN THE JEWISH QUARTER IN JERUSALEM BY Μ. Hershkovitz (pp. 43-45; PI. n, 3—4) Two unique lamps were discovered in a building of the Hero dian period during excavations in the Jewish Quarter: lamp No. 8292/1, from Locus 747; and lamp No. 7914/3, from Locus 739. Both are moulded, probably from the same mould. The nozzles bear traces of soot. These lamps are of the Helle nistic "sunburst" type, common in Jerusalem, the Judean Hills, Samaria and the Coastal Plain in the 2nd-1st centuries BCE. On the nozzles there is a schematic depiction of a human face. In the author's opinion, the schematic character of the depiction is deliberate, rather than the result of poor techni que, and represents an attempt to avoid violating the law forbidding human depictions. Floral and geometric patterns were common decorative motifs on lamps, but the human face is an anomaly in Jewish contexts. These lamps can be precisely dated, as they were part of an assemblage of pottery and coins of the 1st century BCE. ON THE HASMONEAN AND HERODIAN TOWN-PLAN OF JERUSALEM BY Ζ. U. Macoz (pp. 46-57) The town-plan of Jerusalem in the Second Temple period was set forth in the 1950s in two models designed by Vincent and by Avi-Yonah, respectively, and these still largely influence scholars dealing wih this subject. Excavations in Jerusalem from the 1960s on — notably those of Kenyon, Mazar and Avigad — have challenged both models and have raised new theories, some of which are dealt with here. Concerning the Hasmonean city wall enclosing the "Upper City", Kenyon and Tushingham held that it did not cross the Tyropoeon Valley, but this is now refuted on military and archaeological grounds. Basing on the Hellenistic defence systems, the author suggests the existence of main city gates at the crossing point of the Tyropoeon Valley and the Gennath Valley. Herodian town-planning in Jerusalem had to take into ac count the tens of thousands of pilgrims camping outside the city at the time of the three major Jewish feasts, the extreme expansion of the built-up area during Hasmonean times, and the defence of a city spreading over hilly terrain. The solutions of Herod's architects were innovative, monu mental and multi-functional, as is demonstrated through a discussion of the location of the water reservoirs. The three pilgrims' camping grounds mentioned by Josephus were (a) to the north of Antonia, (b) south of the city in the hippodrome area, and (c) northwest of the city, close to Herod's palace (Wars II, 44; IV, 269). Three open reservoirs were thus built adjacent to the three camps: Birket Israin, Hezekiah's Pool and Birket el-Hamra. These pools not only served the pilgrims but also formed part of the city's defence system as moats at vulnerable spots. The pedestrian traffic of the multitudes of pilgrims flowing through the city to and from the Temple Mount was accomo dated by monumental avenues along two main arteries. The "Tyropoeon Avenue", partly uncovered by Bliss and Dickie,</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 67* Hamilton, Johns and Mazar, followed the valley bed and diverged from any rigid, orthogonal plan. This street con nected the pilgrim camps north and south of the city with the Temple. A second, perpendicular avenue is conjectured by the author along the "cross valley" (along modern Tarik Bab el-Silsile). This "Cross Avenue" similarly connected the pil grim camp northwest of the city with the Temple Mount across "Wilson's Arch". At the intersection of these two ave nues, the Xistos mentioned by Josephus (Wars II, 244) was to be found, and thus could be regarded as a sort of "forum". Herod's palace was connected to the Temple Mount through a "Royal Stairway" descending to the "Upper Agora" (Wars V, 137), in the area of Avigad's Byzantine Cardo, and the suggested "Cross Avenue" (Antiquities XV, 410). Of the Herodian fortification system, Josephus's Second Wall is to be explained as a new northern wall, superseding the northern section of the Hasmonean wall. The Hasmonean wall was demolished in Herodian times during construction of the Temple Mount and the "Tyropoeon" and "Cross Avenues". This would explain the absence of remains of the Hasmonean wall in the Tyropoeon Valley. The Second Wall crossing low ground under the Antonia fortress and the towers of Herod's palace, took the shortest possible route, yet it en closed the new quarters which had developed north of the Hasmonean wall (Wars V, 331; Antiquities XIV, 335). It ran in a sharply bent line from the new Gennath Gate to the back of Antonia. A new northern city gate was built where the second wall crossed the Tyropoeon valley. Any attribution of the Roman gate below the modern Damascus Gate to the fortification systems of Second Temple times is to be rejected. The remains there are interpreted as a free-standing triumphal gate, protected by flanking towers — built by Agrippa I. A similar gate was erected by this king at Tiberias; other such free-standing gates were built at Gerasa, Constantinople and Hieropolis. These gates, outside the city walls, were ceremonial and decorative in character, and served to mark the pomerium around the city and the starting point of ceremoneal processions. Josephus's description of the Third Wall (Wars V, 147-157) is an admixture of two narratives: one describing the gate of Agrippa I (V, 148, 152-153, 156) and the other describing the wall hastily built by the Zealots (V, 147, 149-151, 157) and excavated initially by Sukenik and Mayer. (A second part of this paper, discussing the Hasmonean and Herodian Temple Mount, the Acra, the streets of Jerusalem and the Zealots' fortifications, is to appear in a future volume of Eretz-Israel.) A MONUMENT OF THE SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD WEST OF THE OLD CITY OF JERUSALEM by A. Kloner (pp. 58-64; Pis. יג-ט) The newly-explored monument is located east of the tomb known as "Herod's Family Tomb". It was excavated during 1976 and found to be hewn into a scarp of the protruding bedrock. The burial cave comprises four rooms, with a fifth external (constructed) unit which served as an entrance. Rooms III, IV and V contained rectangular depressions for sarcophagi. The local, fissured limestone was plastered over, as is indicated by traces in several corners, on the ceiling and on the walls of the rooms. Fragments of sarcophagi and ossuaries were found in the fill of the rooms. Room II served as a central hall; the lower part of its walls could be traced along the rock floor. The rock walls of the entrance unit on the eastern side were faced with large ashlars. The entrance to the cave, between rooms I and II, was closed by a round rolling-stone, the chan nel of which was found in situ. The channel was 2.84 m long and 0.35 m wide. This is the fourth rock-cut tomb to be found in Jerusalem with its entrance closed by a large rolling-stone. All are dated to the very end of the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. Study of the remains indicates that this tomb was originally no less elaborate that the neighbouring one. ART AND ARCHITECTURE IN AYYUBID JERUSALEM by Μ. Rosen-Ayalon (pp. 65-72; Pis. טו-יד) The Ayyubid period in Jerusalem is one of the less well known periods in terms of archaeology, architecture and art. The basis of this study is primarily the known corpus of dated Ayyubid monuments, to which have been added recently dis covered evidence from the archaeological excavations and several undated landmarks which should be attributed to this period. The study is confined to the area within the walls of the Old City. When summing up the activity of a relatively short period — less than a century — and especially the period following the reconquest of Jerusalem from the Crusaders, it is rather surprising to discover such a limited scope. The distribution of the material is also uneven throughout the period. In several cases there are historical references to the erection of buildings of which nothing today is left, or which have not preserved their Ayyubid portions. The first chapter of Ayyubid architecture in Jerusalem is marked by Salah al-Din, who began restoration of al-Aqsa Mosque; he also initiated the rebuilding of the city walls. The most spectacular contribution to the monuments of Jerusalem in the Ayyubid period occurred during the reign of al-Malik al-Mucezzam cIsa. Religious, military and domestic architec ture are equally represented. Several buildings were merely restored, and some monu ments reflect the sporadic initiative of one or another of the governors or other officials acting either on behalf of the ruler or through personal initiative.</page><page sequence="4">68* ENGLISH SUMMARIES A HOARD OF HEBREW BULLAE FROM THE CITY OF DAVID by Y. Shiloh (pp. 73-87; Pis.יח-טז) Fifty-one bullae were found in the summer of 1982 in Area G of the City of David excavations, in the destruction layer of a house (Locus 967) denoted the "House of the Bullae". Like other buildings of Stratum 10 there, this building exhibited signs of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Of the bullae, 49 were preserved in a good condition, and 41 of them are relatively legible. Four further bullae are ane pigraphic. The inscribed bullae are not ornamented, bearing simple impressions of the normal Hebrew formula: "(Belonging) to X / son (of) Y". For example: "(Belonging) to Bilgai son (of) Delayahu", "(Belonging) to EliSama0 son (of) Semakhya", "(Belonging) to 'Azaryahu son (of) Hilkiyahu", "(Belonging) to Seftiyahu son (of) Safan", "(Belonging) to Benyahu son (of) Hos'ayahu". Palaeographic analysis of these bullae, relative to other seals of the Iron Age II, shows that the letters closest resemble those of the late 7th-early 6th centuries BCE. Some 5096 of the names have the theophoric ending -yahu. An additional 1496 have other theophoric components, such as -el. The theophoric ending -yo does not appear. In deed, no non-Israelite theophoric component seems to appear here. Of all the names on the bullae, 13 do not appear in the Bible, though they are known from other seals or inscriptions. All except one of the names are of historically unknown personages. The one name probably identifiable with a known biblical figure is "Gemaryahu son (of) Safan", whom we would identify with the scribe of that name, active along with Jere miah at the court of Jehoiakim in the 6th year of his reign (604 BCE; see Jer. 36:9-12, 25-26). (The names of three other figures mentioned in the same context — Baruch son (of) Neriahu the scribe, Jerahmeel son (of) the King, and Seraiahu son (of) Neriahu — have recently been identified by Professor Avigad on two bullae and a seal, all of unknown provenance.) The importance of this cache lies in the fact that it came to light in controlled stratigraphical excavations, accompanied by pottey and other finds, and can be related to documented historical events. The location of the "House of the Bullae" may point to the public nature of the archive (?) represented by the bullae. The papyrus documents themselves would have perished during the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. A PROTO-CANAANITE INSCRIPTION RECENTLY DISCOVERED AT TEL LACHISH by D. Ussishkin (pp. 88-89; PI. 1 ,יט) An English version of this article is included in the second preliminary report of the excavations at Tel Lachish, pub lished in Tel Aviv 10 (1983), pp. 155-157. A FOURTH MILLENNIUM BCE SEAL-IMPRESSION FROM GAMLA by A. Ben-Tor (pp. 90-93; PI. 2-4 \ט) The stamp-seal published here was discovered while clearing a fill beneath a house in Area G at Gamla on the Golan Heights. The fill contained numerous Chalcolithic sherds of the Golan type, as well as some Early Bronze Age II and Hellenistic sherds. The seal was thus clearly out of context, and can therefore be dated only on stylistic grounds. It is made of a volcanic, blackish-green stone, not indigenous to the Golan. Therefore, either the material or, more likely, the seal itself was imported. In shape it has clear parallels in Syrian stamp-seals of the late 4th-3rd n^ennia BCE, but it is the southernmost of this type yet discovered. The scene incised on the base seems to include the following three elements, all rather schematic: a qua druped, a snake, and a human figure. The animal has rather close parallels with horned animals portrayed on many 4th-3rd millennia BCE seals found throughout the Ancient Near East (Elam, Syria, Palestine). Such animals are often accompanied by a snake, depicted on our seal by a horizontal line above the animal. Turning the seal 90" counterclockwise, the third element can clearly be seen; only the upper part of the body is shown, with the hands pointing upwards. There are three elongated protrusions on the head of the figure. Scenes composed of a horned animal, a snake and a human figure, or of two of these three elements, are very common in the Ancient Near Eastern glyptic art of the late 4th-3rd millen nia BCE. Seals of this type portray cult scenes — more specifi cally, fertility cult scenes, with the horned animal representing faunal fertility; the snake, vegetal fertility. The human figure, engaged in a cultic dance and disguised as a horned animal, or depicted with plants "growing'' out of its head, also represents one of these two aspects of the fertility cult (in most cases the seal is so schematic that it is impossible to discern whether the protrusions represent horns or plants). Our seal, clearly part of this wide-spread group, should thus be ascribed to the late 4th nullennium BCE, i.e. the Chalcoli thic period, and it apparently was brought to its findspot from one of the nearby Chalcolithic settlements. (An Early Bronze Age I-II date cannot, however, be absolutely ruled out, in the light of the pottery accompanying the seal within the fill.) THE OSTRACON OF AHIQAM FROM HORVAT CUZA by I. Βεγγ-Arieh (pp. 94-96; PI. כ) This ostracon was found during the second season of excava tions in the gate area of the Israelite fortress (7th-6th centuries BCE) at Horvat TJza. It bears four lines, written in an un trained hand:</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 69* (1 )-lm. I'hqm. bn. m—m, -Im to Ahiqam, son of Μ—m, (2) cmdyhw. bn. zkr. mmlda cAmadyahu son of Zakkur, from Molada, (3) hoS'yhw. bn. nwy. mmtn Hoshacyahu son ofNawy,from Rinaton, (4) mky. bn. hslyhw. mmqdh Machi, son of Hisilyahu, from Maqeda. The first and fourth words in the first line are not clear. One possible reading is "Shalom to Ahiqam, son of Menahem". The three men listed here seem to have been sent to the fortress with a written order to Ahiqam, who probably was the local commander. They came from various places, all of them apparently in Judah. The name Rinaton is not known in the Bible, nor does it appear in any other text. Professor B. Mazar suggests identifying it with Dana, located in the southern Hebron Hills. In the Septuagint, Dana is mentioned as Renna. The ostracon indicates that the military organization of Judah included persons who were sent from some distance to protect the borders of the kingdom, probably against the Edomites. A MANDAIC LEAD AMULET WITH FOUR INCANTATIONS by J.C. Greenfield and J. Naveh (pp. 97-107; Pis. כב-כא) This lead amulet, discovered in Khuzistan in Iran, contains four incantations in Mandaic. Three of them have parallels in Mandate amulets previously published, as well as in a recently published Jewish Aramaic incantation bowl. The fine state of preservations allows the authors to correct the readings and interpretations of the previously published texts. The fourth incantation contains a list of the planets and zodiacal signs. (Notes on Iranian words in this amulet are provided by Shaul Shaked.) A HIERARCHIC PATTERN IN THE PRIVATE SEAL-IMPRESSIONS ON THE "LMLK" JAR-HANDLES by Y. Garfinkel (pp. 108-115) Following the recent excavation at Lachish, as well as recent archaeometric studies on the provenance of "Imlk" jars, it has been found that a varied group of so-called private seals were impressed on these same jars (see the appendix to the Hebrew article). As a specific group, these latter seal-impressions are each seen to have a limited distribution in part of Old Testa ment Judah. The different examples were discovered either on a single site or on a mere two or three sites. Such a distribution points to a hierarchic pattern of the seal owners, indicating three classes: inter-regional, regional and local. Further excavations may shift a given seal owner to a higher rank in this hierarchy, but this, however, would not basically negate the pattern suggested. The existence of such a hierarchic pattern and the geogra phical distribution of the seal-impressions on specific sites indicates a well-organized administration, supporting the view that this reflects Judean preparations in the face of Sennache rib's invasion of 701 BCE. A PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTION FROM AKICO by Μ. Dothan (pp. 116-123; PI. כג) During the 1980 season of excavations at Tel Akko, a seven line Phoenician inscription was discovered written on a pot tery bowl. It provides the earliest epigraphic evidence for the existence of a Phoenician temple at Akko, and was probably a copy of an order made by some high authority. According to it, the guild of metalsmiths was supposed to give vessels to the man who was in charge of the temple. Palaeographically, the inscription is close to the contempo raneous inscription from Elephantine; that is, it is from the first half of the 5th century BCE, at a time when Akko became an important military and trade centre. This first substantial Phoenician inscription from Akko is not only a significant addition to Phoenician epigraphy but also provides evidence for various aspects of the cult and temple economy of the southern coast of Phoenicia. CATCH-LINES IN ANCIENT PALAEOGRAPHY AND IN THE BIBLICAL CANON BY Μ. Haran (pp. 124-129) A workable method to determine the relative size of the books of the Bible is based on the printed pages they fill, provided that the text takes up the pages in a uniform manner, within a single edition. This method, employed by the author, clearly shows that the largest book in the biblical canon is Chronicles. This book, however, is the first part of the Chronistic compo sition, the second part of which is Ezra-Nehemiah. Thus, the technical-physical necessity underlying the division of the Chronistic composition into two parts results from the fact that its first part reaches the maximum practical size for a book-scroll in the period in which the biblical canon was formed. A tangible sign for the compositional connection between the books of Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah is the fact that the two verses concluding Chronicles appear also at the beginning of Ezra-Nehemiah, constituting a direct continuity between the two. Scholars have been hard put to explain the proper place of the two verses — the place from which they were copied, as it were, into the other book. It is the author's contention that these actually represent the scribal device of</page><page sequence="6">70* ENGLISH SUMMARIES "catch-lines" basing on a unity of authorship of the two books; this device is intended to facilitate the reader's continuous reading into the second book-scroll. It was prevalent in antiqu ity, and parallels are adduced from Mesopotamia (on clay tablets) and the Greco-Roman world (on scrolls). Such catch lines were written at the end of the first scroll and not, as certain scholars have maintained, at the beginning of the succeeding scroll. THE PAGAN VERSION OF PSALM 20:2-6 — VICISSITUDES OF A PSALMODIC CREATION IN ISRAEL AND ITS NEIGHBOURS by Μ. Weinfeld (pp. 130-140) Following the publication by Nims and Steiner of the Aramaic text in Demotic script which overlaps Ps. 20:2-6, the author investigates the relationship between Psalm 20 and the Demo tic text, reaching the following conclusions: The pagan text constitutes a prayer of Canaanite or Nor thern Israelite origin, as is demonstrated by the deities men tioned there: Baai-Samem and El-Beth-El; and by the mention of Zaphon, the venerated mountain in North Syria. The ad dress to the heavenly bow and the moon, found in this prayer, also points in this same direction. On the other hand, the gods Horus and Mar were introduced into the prayer through Egyp tian influence. The pagan or syncretistic prayer underlying the Demotic prayer was taken by a Jerusalemite court poet and reworked according to the monotheistic principles prevailing in Judah in the 8th-7th centuries BCE. The Jerusalemite poet removed the names of the pagan deities and, by the same token, re placed Mount Zaphon with Mount Zion. Further, he changed the old prayer, which was formulated in the first person plural, into a prayer for the anointed king of Zion (v. 7). Moreover, he added a passage of his own to the old prayer, introducing a doctrine in conformance with the theology of the Deutero nomic reform movement in the Hezekianic-Josianic period. In accordance with "Name Theology", he describes God, in his inserted passage, as answering from heaven (and not from the Temple, as occurs in his Vorlage; compare v. 7 with v. 3). The old prayer may have reached Jerusalem via Northern Israel, where El-Beth-El (addressed in the Demotic prayer) played an important role (cf. Gen. 35:3, 7; Hos. 12:5; Jer. 48:13). THE LACHISH LETTERS — ORIGINALS OR COPIES AND DRAFTS? by Y. Yadin (pp. 141-146) The Lachish Letters, still one of the most important epigra phical discoveries made in Israel, have long been considered to be original letters sent to the commander of Lachish. The present article challenges this conclusion, raising the probabil ity that they are copies or, more precisely, drafts and copies of just a few letters, which were later written out on papyrus for dispatch from Lachish, apparently to Jerusalem. A full treatment and discussion can be found in the English version of this article, in H. Shanks, ed., Recent Archaeological Discoveries in Israel, Jerusalem-Washington, 1984, pp. 179-186. THE PRONOUN ש"" IN BIBLICAL HEBREW IN THE LIGHT OF ANCIENT EPIGRAPHY by Β. A. Levine (pp. 147-152) Since Bergstrasser's study of more than 70 years ago, newly discovered epigraphic evidence has enabled the more accurate tracing of the diffusion of the pronoun "אש" and its prefixed form "ש". The alleged role of the Aramaic language in the increased usage of the prefixed form in Late Biblical Hebrew is reassessed, and it is shown to be less important that was previously thought. In contrast, developments in Phoenician and Punic (including Neo-Punic) seem to parallel those in Hebrew, whereas the Aramaic factor seems to be limited to certain syntactic situations. The likelihood of regional dialects in Biblical Hebrew is also a factor to be weighed in the diach ronic analysis of this pronoun. CAVES OF REFUGE AND JEWISH INSCRIPTIONS ON THE CLIFFS OF NAHAL MICHMAS by J. Patrich (pp. 153-166; Pis. כז-כד) Two complexes of almost inaccessible rock-cut caves are situ ated on the northern cliffs of Nahal Michmas (Wadi Suweinit), some 10 km northeast of Jerusalem. This site, known as el-cAleiliyat, "the upper chambers", has until now been consi dered part of the laura of St. Firmin. The eastern of the two complexes comprises two cave chambers and two cisterns (one with a broad staircase leading down into it, and the other of bell shape). On a visit to the site late in 1981, the author discovered four legible Jewish Ara maic inscriptions, as well as depictions of two menorot and a pentagram, all drawn in charcoal on the plaster of the bell shaped cistern. The stepped cistern, previously identified as a Christian baptistry, was observed to resemble a Jewish ritual bath (miqveh). Consequently, it was realized that the caves had originally been fitted out by Jews sometime during the Second Temple period, probably as shelters in time of emergency; only later were they reused by Christian hermits, in the 6th century CE. It was then that crosses, accompanied by Greek and Syriac</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 71' inscriptions, were drawn in red on the rocks of the eastern complex. Jewish inscription No. 1 comprises two abecedaries, written in two separate lines (alef-mem, and alefXo tav, including final forms). Though written out at a single time, they are by two different hands. The script is formal Late Herodian (dated by F.M. Cross to 20-70 CE). A Byzantine cross partially overlaps the letter tet of the upper line. Inscription No. 2 has been read as follows:(יועזר התעקד עלמות מטר[. The language here is Aramaic, which we translate as: "Joezer was uprooted, the guards entered." Inscription No. 3, written beneath the pentagram, reads: (שלם שלם אמון, "Peace! Peace! Amen." Inscription No. 4 reads: אגלגיל, the meaning of which is not clear. The menorot and the pentagram, as well as the abecedaries, are to be considered amuletic. A period of emergency is re fleeted in the inscriptions and drawings, possibly the First Jewish Revolt against the Romans (66-73 CE). The Syriac inscriptions, all on the walls of the stepped cistern, are a quotation from Psalms 29: 3: "The voice of the Lord is upon the water" — repeated three times. The abbre viated Greek inscriptions read: IC XC; IC XC NI KA; and IC XC βασιλίυη. The western complex is composed of four levels of caves, interconnected by a rock-cut tunnel and an external staircase cut along the cliff-face. The three upper levels share a common water system. Jar rims found in the third level indicate that the caves were reused by Jews during the Bar-Kokhba Revolt (132-135 CE). This complex was intended for at least four families, while the more spacious eastern one, equipped with a ritual bath, was for a single family, possibly of priestly descent. According to Josephus (Wars IV, 512-513), during the First Jewish Revolt, Simeon bar Giora constructed store-chambers and quarters for his troops in caves in a ravine called Pheretae (Φίρ(ται), which is identified with Wadi Fara — the upper segment of Wadi Kelt. Wadi Suweinit, the site of our caves, is the main northern tributary of Wadi Kelt. It is thus suggested that el-cAleiliyat, might have been part of Simeon bar Giora's enterprise. THE "BOUNDARY OF GEZER" — ON THE JEWISH SETTLEMENT AT GEZER IN HASMONEAN TIMES by R. Reich (pp. 167-179; Pis. ל-כח) The first of the Gezer boundary inscriptions was found by Clermont-Ganneau in 1874, and since then additional inscrip tions have been found, most of them bearing the Hebrew words thm gzr ("Boundary of Gezer") and the Greek word Alkiou ("Belonging to Alkios") inscribed above and inverted. Confusion in the publication of these inscriptions (such as one of them being published twice; and others being published without drawings, photographs or exact locations) calls for publication of a detailed corpus. Several characteristics concerning the inscription are now revealed: there is a consistency in the orientation of the in scriptions in relation to the mound, as shown by those still in situ. The Hebrew is to be read while facing the mound, while the Greek faces the opposite direction (mainly south and east). This would indicate that Alkios was the owner of the land adjacent to the lands of Gezer (and not the owner of the territory marked by the inscriptions, as has been the commonly-held view till now). The boundary encircles an area of ca. 4 sq. km, with Tel Gezer occupying the north-western corner. A date at the end of the 2nd and beginning of the 1st centuries BCE can be accepted as the most plausible for the inscriptions. This phenomenon of marking a border by stones inscribed with the city name is unique, apparently implying an unusual territorial status. The author relates this to the Hasmonean conquest of Gezer (1 Macc. 13: 43-48): An observant Jewish community was then settled on the site, with John Hyrcanus I appointed as Governor. The author identifies the area marked by the boundary inscriptions as the agricultural land belonging to this new Jewish community, an enclave within lands owned by Gentiles. This was probably part of an early, local attempt to demarcate lands subject to the agricultural precepts concerning the Holy Land, especially those of the priestly offerings. The experience gained by Hyrcanus here at Gezer may have been the basis for the regulations which he seems to have instituted after ascending the throne in Jerusa lem (cf. Mishnah, Macaser Sheni, 5, 15). "RASHPUNA" — A CASE OF EPIGRAPHIC ERROR by Η. Tadmor (pp. 180-182) A summary inscription of Tiglat-pileser III from Nimrud (ND 400; Wiseman, Iraq 13 [ 1951 ], p. 23) lists Ka-aS-pu-na among the cities conquered by Tiglat-pileser on the North Phoenician coast during one of his campaigns to the West (738-732 BCE). A fragmentary annal-slab of the same king, which has survived only in Layard's copy (ICC 65), refers to the same toponym: Ka-aS-pu-na. However, in Rost's edition of the latter text (Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglath-pilesers III, 1893, p. 20 and PI. XXI), as well as of two other texts (ibid., pp. 78, 86), this toponym appears as Ra-as-pu-na, evidently an epigraphic error. Subse quently, it was suggested to identify this "Rashpuna" with Arsuf-Apollonia, and a modern settlement of Rishpon nearby commemorates the same name. The present paper traces the history of this curious fallacy and considers its bearing on certain problems in historical geography.</page><page sequence="8">72* ENGLISH SUMMARIES ARCHITECTURE OF EGYPTIAN "GOVERNORS' RESIDENCIES" IN LATE BRONZE AGE PALESTINE by E D. Oren (pp. 183-199; Pis. לד-לא) The colonization of Canaan under the Egyptian New King dom resulted in a decisive Egyptian impact on the cultural and political system of Canaan. Excavations have yielded much archaeological evidence for this influence in architecture, art, burials customs and other realms. The present study deals with a specific category of domestic architecture in Canaan, the plan and construction details of which indicate the adaptation of Egyptian architecture to local building tradition. This type of building, called here "Governor's Residency", has been recorded at Tel Serac, Tell Jemmeh, Tell Hesi, Tell el Fariah(S), Tel Masos, Beth-Shan and (perhaps) Aphek. These mud-brick structures are carefully built, with thick outer walls on brick foundations; their square plan consists of a central hall or courtyard surrounded by a series of rooms, corridors and storerooms, as well as a stairway leading to the upper storey. Analogies in Egyptian New Kingdom domestic archi tecture, notably at El-Amarna, Malkata and Gurob, demon strate that the buildings in Canaan were patterned after cha racteristic Egyptian models. The distribution of "Governors' Residencies" suggests that they were located at sites known to have been Egyptian administative centres or to have had Egyp tian contacts, as evidenced by the archaeological record. The occurrence of these structures in southern Canaan arguments our understanding of the Egyptian hold over this region. Lite rary evidence coupled with the archaeological material, indi cates that southern Canaan — with Gaza ("Pa-Canaan" of the Egyptian sources) as its capital city — became the focus of Egyptian rule in Asia, particularly under the 19th and 20th dynasties. The article also discusses the chronological and historical aspects of the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age, with an emphasis on the reorganization of the admini stration in Canaan under Ramesses III. A KRATER FROM ARAD by Μ. Aharoni (pp. 200-201; PL לה) During the fifth season of excavations at Arad, a krater of unusually graceful form was found in locus 948a (Stratum VII). Close parallels have been found at Samaria and in Cy prus. Gjerstad described one of these parallels as Argive. Karagheorgis found many examples of the same type, one of which is from a tomb of a princess who, according to the excavator, was of the new settlers of Greece. The kraters from Cyprus are decorated with horizontal lines and metopes, while the Arad example is plain and seems to be of local manufac tore. In the Arad Ostraca, Kittyim are mentioned several times, and Y. Aharoni held that they came from Greece or Cyprus, and served as mercenaries. This krater is further sup port of his assumption. GLACIS 10014 AND GEZER'S LATE BRONZE AGE FORTIFICATIONS by S. Bunimovitz (pp. 202-208) An English version of this article appears in Tel Aviv 10 (1983), pp. 61-70. ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF ANATHOTH by A. Biran (pp. 209-214; Pis.פא-לז) As early as 1936, the author expressed doubts as to the ident ification of biblical Anathoth with Ras el-Kharrubeh, although this view was not shared by Albright and others. A brief rescue excavation was undertaken on that site in 1983, by the He brew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and at the nearby site of Deir es-Sid. At Ras el-Kharrubeh, architectural remains from the Persian and Hellenistic periods came to light, but none of the Israelite period. The pottery, which includes storage-jais, jugs, juglets, cooking-pots and oil-lamps, is of the 5th-4th and 1st centuries BCE. Only 40 sherds are of the 7th-early 6th centuries BCE. The author has concluded that Ras el-Kharrubeh could not be the Anathoth mentioned in Joshua 21: 18 and 1 Kings 2: 26, or that of the prophet Jeremiah. Although the excavations at Deir es-Sid revealed nothing of the Early Iron Age, extensive architectural remains and pot tery of the 7th century BCE were uncovered. At the highest point of the hill, a raised platform came to light, built of stones and encircled by a wall of large stones. On the eastern slope of the hill, a stone building (7 X 6 m) was cleared, characte rized by its pillars and two niche in its western wall. Other architectural remains and large monoliths were found scat tered over the entire 10-acre site. The pottery is predominantly of the 7th-early 6th centuries BCE, with a few sherds of the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. The author sug gests identifying Jeremiah's Anathoth with Deir es-Sid, al though the location of the earlier Anathoth remains enigmatic. PHOENICIAN STONE VESSELS FROM THE EIGHTH-SEVENTH CENTURIES BCE by D. Barag (pp. 215-232; Pis. םז-0נ) Limestone and alabaster objects from Palestine, Transjordan and Phoenecia dating from the 8th-7th centuries BCE were usually embellished with various decorations, engraved, cut in</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 73' relief or inlaid with glass and similar materials. The earliest examples appear during the first half of the 8th century BCE (e.g. in Hazor Stratum VI). Round, dish-like cosmetic palettes, beaker-shaped vessels and probably the enigmatic object exca vated together with the Samaria ivories, date from that cen tury. Cosmetic palettes of the same types, flat palettes and similar palettes with a circular concavity (a type hitherto un published) date from the 7th century BCE. The production of all these types ceased either in the second half of the 7th century or early in the 6th century BCE. These stone vessels and objects belong to a considerably larger assemblage of luxury goods from the same period. The rather common round cosmetic palettes are connected with Phoenician 8th century BCE ivories, as is shown by a palette inlaid with mosaic glass inlays from Megiddo, palettes inlaid with simple glass discs and a palette decorated with lotus flowers and buds. The very rare examples of glass and faience palettes were probably made in Phoenicia and imported into Palestine. The beaker-shaped vessel from Samaria also has a parallel in glass (from Praeneste in Italy), which was probably made in Phoenicia. The flat palettes are closely connected with the engraved tridacna shells, as well as the dish-like palettes. The flat palette with concavity with a ritual scene is connected with Phoeni cian 8th century BCE ivories and the 7th century BCE en graved tridacna shells. An enigmatic stone object from Sama ria is also decorated with a lotus flower-and-bud design, similar to that on a cosmetic palette and on Phoenician ivo ries. The white limestone and alabaster, the glass inlays and polychrome engraved decorations resemble 8th century BCE ivories although stone was used for practical reasons. The stone vessels discussed here are thus connected with the Phoe nician ivories, engraved tridacna shells and glass and faience objects and form yet another class of Phoenician luxury goods from the 8th-7th centuries BCE. GREEK INFLUENCE ON POTTERY VESSELS FROM BEER-SHEVA by S. Geva (pp. 233-237; PL מח) In Y. Aharoni's excavations at Beer-Sheva, vessels described by the excavators as "kraters" were uncovered in Stratum II. They are distinguished by horizontal loop-handles, a feature foreign to local Judean pottery. Nor do they bear any resembl ance to other vessels found at Beer-Sheva or elsewhere in Judah. Since the excavator was unable to supply convincing parallels (and therefore could assign no origin to these vessels), the author tends to regard these vessels as having been manu factured under Greek influence. The potter, or someone who instructed him in his work, had seen Greek vessels and the examples from Beer-Sheva represent an attempt to produce imitations in general appearance. THE FIRST DYNASTY EGYPTIAN BUILDING AT ΈΝ-BESOR by R. Gophna and D. Gazit (pp. 238-242) In the small-scale excavations during 1979-1983 at Έη-Besor, new data concerning the plan, construction and function of the Egyptian building of Stratum III (Building A) was accumu lated. From the size of its sun-dried bricks (the Egyptian standard of 8 X 12 X 23 cm) and the method of laying and bonding them, there is no doubt that the building was erected by Egyptians of the First Dynasty. The building, covering an area of about 85 sq. m, consisted of two small rooms (A-B), an open courtyard (C), and an area partitioned ofT for use as a bakery, brewery and other installa tions (D). Apparendy this was a stage-post established by a small royal expedition sent to Canaan by some First Dynasty king, intended mainly to control the richest and most stable perennial water source in the entire southern Coastal Plain of Canaan. Building A is the only example of an Egyptian build ing of this type and date discovered in Canaan or Egypt. KHIRBET EL-QUNEITRA — A BYZANTINE MONASTERY IN THE WILDERNISS OF ZIPH BY Y. Hirschfeld (pp. 243-255; Pis. נ־&amp;ט) On the edge of the Judean Desert, ca. 4 km east of Tel Ziph, a Byzantine monastery was identified in the ruins of Khirbet el־Quneitra (grid ref. 1669.0960). This monastery is associated with St. Euthyme who settled in the desert in 423-428 CE. There are several small, perennial springs in the area, one (cAin el-Quneitra) at the foot of the site. The remains cover an area of 30 X 50 m (about 1.5 dunams). The walls are preserved to a height of 1.0-1.5 m. The identifiable elements of the complex include a chapel, a tower, dwelling units, a reservoir and an oil-press — all arranged around an inner courtyard. Thus, it was a sort of coenobium, built for communal life. The preservation of most of the components of the monastery allows for a reconstruction of its original appearance. The tower was built at the highest point of the site, enabling it to serve as a lookout and for defending the main entrance to the complex, on the south. The chapel is quite simple in construction, with a single apse, and a single entrance on the west. The dwelling quarters are adjacent to the northern wall of the chapel. The courtyard was paved in rather crude, white mosaics, partly over a cistern at the centre. The remains of the oil-press include a pair of stone posts in situ. On the natural terrace north of the monastery, a garden was laid out. Further remains of agricultural terraces could be identified in the vicinity. The total area of the fields at the disposal of the monks (for vegetables and olive groves) was ca. 2 dunams.</page><page sequence="10">74* ENGLISH SUMMARIES THE MENORAH IN FIRST AND SECOND TEMPLE TIMES IN THE LIGHT OF THE SOURCES AND ARCHAEOLOGY by R. Hachlili and R. Merhav (pp. 256-267; PI. נא) The Tabernacle menorah was not a seven-branched candela brum; rather, it had a conical base decorated with a floral capital, surmounted by a lamp or bowl. It was similar to cult and incense stands, as well as other candelabra of the Ancient Near East. The menorot in Solomon's Temple were of a simi lar form. The first candelabrum of seven-lamp form was that mentioned by Zachariah, with a conical base supporting a bowl with seven lamps. It is most probable that the seven branched menorah evolved between the time of the Return from Exile and the Hasmonean period. Consequently, the account in Exodus, of a seven-branched menorah, describes a later development of the menorah form. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTHERN INTERIOR WALL OF THE KHORAZIN SYNAGOGUE by Ζ. Yeivin (pp. 268-276; Pis. נה-נב) Excavations at Khorazin were renewed in 1980-81, under the auspices of the Department of Antiquities and Museums and the National Parks Authority. Inter alia, sectional trenches were made within the synagogue, and all the architectural fragments found scattered about the building were registered. In the southern sectional trench, in the interior opposite the openings in the southern wall (the side toward Jerusalem), and mainly in the area between the central and western openings, a stone-built substructure was found, differing from the other foundations and fills. This was probably intended to support a special architectural element. Of the numerous architectural fragments discovered here, four are noteworthy in this context: (1) a finely ornamented engaged pillar; (2) a large, ornamented fragment, undoubtedly of a well-worked niche; (3) an ornamented stone, apparently from the same order and possibly also part of the same niche; and (4) an elongated piece of stone ("nail") on the face of which is clearly carved a depiction of a niche flanked by columns, two on either side. Besides these there were seven ornamental fragments not related to the ornamentation of the synagogue structure per se. This appears to be sufficient to enable the reconstruction of an ornamented structure standing on the floor between the central and western openings, standing out from the wall and including a carved niche (2 X 1.3 X 1 m). This resembles the niche of the Holy Ark in the synagogue at Dura-Europos. In analogy to the synagogue found at Sardis (and possibly others as well), a similar structure should also be sought between the central and the eastern openings. A further analogy for this arrangement can be seen in the synagogue at Khirbet Susiya, where there are two bemahs adjoining the northern wall (which lies toward Jerusalem); one of these is centrally posi tioned and is connected with the niche of the Holy Ark, while the other was apparently the bemah for the reading of the Torah. The inscription of the "Seat of Moses" found in the sou thern part of the synagogue at Khorazin in the 1920s, men tions one Yudan ben Ishmael, who made the טטוה and its steps. When the "seat" was first published (by J.L. Epstein, in 1930), the above word was not understood as a pillared hall but as סטור, a shelf, an elevated place which could serve as a shelf or bench. This interpretation indeed now seems to be correct, and the installation referred to was apparently used for the reading from the Torah. Thus, it is proposed to reconstruct the niche of the Holy Ark between the central and western openings, carved into a struc ture jutting out from the wall and standing upon several steps. Symmetrically arranged, the סטוה probably stood between the central and eastern openings; it probably also stood on several steps. The "Seat of Moses" was probably located on the latter platform, beneath a built baldachin. THE FINDS FROM BETH-SHEARIM AND THEIR IMPORTANCE FOR THE STUDY OF THE TALMUDIC PERIOD BY L.I. Levine (pp. 277-281) Changes over the last 50 years in the study of Jewish history in general, and that of the Talmudic period in particular, have been revolutionary. In the main, it has been archaeological data which led to a thorough re-evaluation of the period, providing a necessary balance to the almost total dominance of rabbinic literature as the source of information for this period. Three areas upon which the archaeological finds of Beth-Shearim have made an impact are noted: (1) the promin ence of the Patriarch as leader of the Jewish community in the 3rd and 4th centuries CE, despite his almost total exclusion (not to speak of denegration) in later Amoraic literature; (2) the marked changes in Jewish funerary practice, as well as in the use of figural representation during late antiquity; (3) the extent of hellenization among the Jews of ancient Palestine as evidenced by the Beth-Shearim inscriptions. Subsequent to the Beth-Shearim excavations, and perhaps stimulated by them, there has been a deluge of scholarly publications examining the nature and extent of Greco Roman influence on Jewish society and Judaism. Thus, these excavations are noteworthy not only for their remarkable finds, but also for their far-reaching implications concerning our understanding of the past.</page><page sequence="11">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 75* TWO TUMULI IN THE JORDAN VALLEY (YAFIT) by Y. Magen (pp. 282-292; Pis. נט-נו) The author excavated two tumuh located on a ridge west of the main Jordan Valley highway, north of the military monu ment near the entrance to Sartaba, adjacent to Moshav Yafit. The tumuh are on a steep slope, tumulus A higher up than Β and some 60 m away. Few objects were found in A, but the smaller tumulus Β proved more promising and better pre served. The tumuh were 9 m and 7 m in diameter, with inner circles of 3 m and 3.5 m, respectively. In tumulus B, a large stone divided the inner circle into two cells. In both, the inner circle had apparently been roofed over with large stone slabs. The find in tumulus Β included human bones, representing some six individuals. The pottery, probably representing fune rary offerings, was very fragmentary and worn. The few ident ifiable forms included the base of a "torpedo "-shaped store-jar of the Persian period. A cylinder-seal of yellow faience was in the "Mitannian" style (Kantor's "Depleted style"), of the Late Bronze Age, 14th-13th centuries BCE. A fragment of a juglet in bluish glass with yellow and white dragged ornamentation is apparently of the 6th^tth centuries BCE. Various jewellery includes, in silver, a fibula, a small earring, a large silver ring; and in bronze, small earrings and plain rings; in shell and ostrich egg-shell, beads and a pendant necklace. A small silver coin is of the mid-4th century BCE. A faience scaraboid is most probably of the Persian period. Though the assemblage from tumulus Β appears to be some what mixed, ranging from the Late Bronze Age to the first half of the 4th century BCE, all the identifiable pottery points to end of the Iron Age and the Persian period. The other finds — with the outstanding exception of the cylinder-seal, which seems to be accidental or intrusive — are of this same span. In any event, no earlier period of use is indicate for the tumuli. The major significance of these two tumuli at Yafit lies in the fact that they have revealed a new sort of burial in Eretz-Israel in this period, apparently representing the funerary customs of a non-sedentary population living in the Jordan Valley. "THOSE WHO BURIED THEIR DEAD IN BETH SHEARIM" by Β. Mazar (pp. 293-299, PI. פד) The author briefly summarizes the results of the excavations at Beth-Shearim, conducted under his direction in 1936-40, 1956 and 1959, and under the direction of N. Avigad in 1953-55 and 1958 — published in several preliminary reports and in three volumes of final reports. Special attention is paid to the flourishing period of the town, and the centrality of its necropolis, from the days of the residency of R. Judah Nasi there, early in the 3rd century CE, when the town had attained the status of a national-religious focal point, down to the days of its destruction by Galius Caesar, under Constantius II, in the mid-4th century CE. Study of the public catacombs and the family burial caves, with their architectural remains, sarcophagi, artistic ornaments and many inscriptions (mostly in Greek, but some in Hebrew, Aramaic and Palmyrene), demonstrate that there were extensive, well planned burial activities here for a period of some 150 years. The dead were from Beth-Shearim (Besara) itself and the Jewish villages of Galilee (and apparently also the Golan), as well as from the diaspora communities of Hither Asia. It is noteworthy that in the catacombs discovered on the western slope of the hill of Beth-Shearim, most of the burials were of Palmyrene Jews, whereas in those on the northern slope, there are many burials of Jews from the Phoenician coastal towns; while on the hill to the northwest, burials of Jews from Himyar (in Arabia) and Esia (apparently Elath, on the Red Sea) have been found. Since only a limited part of the necropolis of Beth-Shearim has been uncovered so far, it is hoped that renewed excavations on this important site will bring to light tombs of persons from other areas, in Eretz-Israel and abroad. BETWEEN JUDAH AND PHILISTIA: TIMNAH (TEL BATASH) IN THE IRON AGE II by A. Mazar (pp. 300-324; Pis. סה-ס) Excavations conducted at Timnah (Tel Batash in the Sorek Valley), under G.L. Klem and the author, have revealed im portant data for the history of the site and the material culture of the region in the Iron Age II. The history of Timnah during this period according to the biblical and Assyrian sources is analysed, and the stratigraphic sequence on the site is de scribed (see also G.L. Kelm and A. Mazar, BASOR 248 [1982], pp. 1-36). A description of the architectural finds in the various areas follows. The fortification system includes a 4 m wide city wall, a stone glacis and a lower revetment wall. This system was founded in Stratum III (8th century BCE) and was slightly modified in Stratum II, when the lower revetment wall probably was replaced by an earth glacis. Interpretation of the development of the city gate is strewn with stratigraphic difficulties, due to poor preservation. Main changes from the preliminary results published in BASOR 248 are as follows: the 10th century BCE gate (Stratum IV) pro bably included only the two massive towers, while the L shaped outer wall was part of an outer gate of Stratum III, and perhaps also of Stratum II. The dwelling area described in BASOR 248 was further excavated. One of the houses con tained a well-preserved oil-press; parts of additional buildings now enable reconstruction of the city-plan and the stratigra phic development in this part of the town. The large collection of restorable pottery from Stratum II buildings is published in summary form, emphasizing its uni queness. It is a homogeneous pottery assemblage of the late</page><page sequence="12">76* ENGLISH SUMMARIES 7th century BCE, containing forms typical of Judah, along with forms characteristic of Philistia, as well as Phoenician types and imitations of Assyrian shapes. The composition of the assemblage is not parallelled elsewhere, and is perhaps characteristic of the border region between Judah and Phi listia. This material is to appear also in the second preliminary report on the 3rd to 6th seasons, to be published shortly in BASOR. DOOR-SEALINGS IN THE MARI PALACE — A TEXTUAL-ARCHAEOLOGICAL CORRELATION by A. Mala mat (pp. 325-330; PI.סו) At Mail, on the Middle Euphrates in Syria, several Old Baby Ionian texts describe the retrieval of materials from sealed store-rooms and archives, and the subsequent resealing of the doors. In the Mari place, the excavator, A. Parrot, was baffled by a feature which he called "boutons de sonnette" — "doorbells". Several instances of this feature have recently been interpreted — by the present author and by others, independently — as a means of sealing such store-rooms in the palace. The author also points to three instances of the sealing of chambers (or the like) in much later Bible-oriented contexts: in the Elephantine Papyri (leavened bread, in the "Passover Papyrus"); in the Book of Daniel (the Lions' Den, 6: 18); and in the New Testament (Jesus's tomb, Matthew 27: 66). An English version of this article is to appear in Comptes rendus, XXX' Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Lei den, July 1983, in press. In the present version, the Palestinian and biblical aspects are emphasized. CARMEL IN DAROMA by A. Negev (pp. 331-334; PI. סז) In the southern part of the Judean hills — known in Mishnaic and Talmudic times as aDaroma", the "South" — there were several small Jewish towns which survived the First and Se cond Revolts against Rome. However, after suppression of the Bar-Kokhba Revolt, they were forced to share their territories with the Roman army, which occupied strategic points north, northeast and south of the region. One of the towns strongly affected by the new political situation was Carmel, the site of the much earlier activities of David, Nabal and other biblical personages. This military post was still of much importance in the 5th and 6th centuries CE, by which time Carmel (iden tified with Khirbet Karmil) had become an important Chris tian town. The author suggests that the Jewish community of ancient Carmel partly moved to a new site — the large, hitherto unidentified ruin of Khirbet Susiya, situated less than 2.5 km to the southwest, naming it Carmel. This identification is supported by analysis of the relevant passages in Eusebius,s Onomasticon, which mentions two separate sites, one biblical Carmel, Roman Chermela (or Chermula in the later sources), and the Jewish village of Carmel (with which the Roman army is not connected by Eusebius). In the summer of 1984, the author conducted large-scale excavations at Khirbet Susiya, on behalf of the Hebrew Uni versity in Jerusalem. The remains of a public building (Build ing A), ashlar-built, were uncovered; amongst its ruins, a lintel was found decorated with two menorot. A slot for a mezuzah can be seen on one doorpost, and a ritual bath (miqveh) was discovered in one of the rooms. A dwelling cave, the lintel of which was decorated with a menorah, was also partly cleared. One of the walls of the cave is built of ashlars. On the surface, numerous large ashlars are lying about, including two lintels with tabulae ansatae and stylized rosettes. The village of Euse bius's day apparently grew to importance only a century later. The economy of Carmel/Khirbet Susiya was based mainly on olive-oil and wine production. URBAN PLANNING IN LATE BRONZE AGE CYPRUS by Ο. Negbi (pp. 335-343) The initial phase of the Iron Age in Cyprus (Late Cypriot IIIA) is generally thought to have brought about a complete change in the pattern of settlement on the island. This change is especially remarkable in the large urban centres, where town planning, monumental buildings and ashlar masonry are the most prominent innovations. Recent excavations indicate, however, that these innova tions were introduced to the island already in the final phase of the Late Bronze Age (Late Cypriot IIC). This assumption is based mainly on short-lived settlements of that period, such as Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios. A re-evaluation of earlier exca vations further indicates that at Bronze Age sites which con tinued into the Iron Age, town-planning, monumental build ings and ashlar masonry are diagnostic to the Late Cypriot IIC rather than to the Late Cypriot IIIA. This is best exemplified at Enkomi, where the fortifications built in the Late Cypriot IIC can be shown to correspond to a new layout of the town. The large areas excavated at Enkomi provide us with sufficient data for reconstructing the layout of the entire town in that period. Situated on a plain and cover ing an enormous area (ca. 160 dunams), the network of ortho gonal streets and monumental buildings with ashlar facades, which are the main feature of Enkomi the Late Cypriot IIC, recalls the much later Hippodamic plan. These features appear in other towns in eastern Cyprus in this period. Like Enkomi, most of these towns were destroyed at the end of the Late Cypriot II, but in contrast to Kalavasos</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 77* Ayios Dhimitrios, they were reoccupied at the beginning of the Late Cypriot III. At Hala Sultan Tekke, and especially at Kition and Enkomi, Late Cypriot IIC architectural elements were apparently re-used in the Late Cypriot IIIA buildings. The vast amount of data from Enkomi enables us to demon strate further that the layout of the Late Cypriot IIC town was severely disrupted in Late Cypriot IIIA times. Thus, Enkomi of the Early Iron Age hardly reflects the well-planned town of the Late Bronze Age. It is thus suggested that urbanism in Cyprus reached a climax prior to (rather than after) the "Achaean" and/or "Sea People" destruction of ca. 1,200 BCE. The prosperity of the eastern coastal towns of Cyprus prior to the destruction can best be explained in the light of contacts with the maritime centres of the Levant. The intensity of these contacts is well attested in the documents from Ras Shamra, supporting the view that building operations in Cyprus ("Alasia") were due mainly to Ugaritic inspiration. Ashlar masonry at Enkomi and Kition has its closest parallels in the palaces at Ras Shamra and Ras Ibn Khani. At the latter site, an orthogonal layout of a well-planned town is now being revealed. It is thus tempting to suggest that Ugaritic architects were directly involved in planning the new harbour towns in Cyprus at the twilight of the Late Bronze Age. THE SWIMMING POOLS OF THE HASMONEAN PERIOD AT JERICHO by Ε. Netzer (pp. 344-352; Pis. סמ-סח) Seven or eight bathing and swimming pools were uncovered within the complex of the Hasmonean winter-palace at Jen cho (of the first half of the 1st century BCE). The pools were built in stages, in accord with the development of the entire complex. First to be built, west of the main building, were two small pools (about 8.8 X 8.3 m each). A pair of larger pools (13.4 X 18 m each) was later built at the centre of a large architectural unit ("the pool complex"), east of the main building. Further pools were built along with the twin palaces added still later, south of the pool complex. Each of these palaces had a small pool at its side (8 X 8 m, on the west, and 7 X 7 m on the east). A larger pool, measuring 12.5 X 20 m, was then added east of the twin palaces. All these pools had features in common: all were 3.0-3.7 m deep, and were well plastered, and had a bench built into their walls, with a wide flight of steps leading from one corner down to the floor. They were built in two standard sizes, roughly 8 X 8 m and 13 X 18 m. The fact that in two instances they were built in pairs may indicate a functional division (i.e. separations between the sexes). The author tends to date the large open pool (13 X 18 m) at the southern edge of Masada to the Hasmonean period, as well, for it has the same features in common with the above. A tendency toward larger pools can be discerned in Herod's day. At Jericho, a pool of 18 X 32 m (combining two Hasmo nean pools) and one of 90 X 42 m, were integrated into Herod's winter-palaces. A pool of 70 X 64 m was at the centre of Lower Herodium, and a pool of 18 X 35 m was built at the centre of the promentory-palace west of the theatre at Caesa rea, also probably belonging to Herod. The tradition underlying such pools probably came from the Hellenistic culture, and the Greeks had swimming pools adjacent to their gymnasia and sports installations. It is proba ble, however, that a tradition of integrating swimming pools into villas and palaces developed independently at Jericho in the Hasmonean period. THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN OF THE ROMAN TEMPLE AT KEDESH by A. Ovadiah, Μ. Fischer and I. Roll (pp. 353-360; Pis. עד-ע) The remains of an architectural complex are well preserved on a hill east of Tel Kedesh in Upper Galilee. They include a temenos (80 X 55 m) with a monumental temple at its centre. The rectangular temple (inner measurements: 20 X 17.6 m) has a portico and a cella. Of the eastern facade, 14 courses have been preserved, to a height of 7.5 m. The facade includes a large, central doorway and two laterial openings, all well built and ornamented. The temple was dry-built of well dressed ashlars. Before it, decorated elements of the entabla ture, bases, columns and corinthian capitals were found, indi eating that the structure probably stood about 12 m high. These remains enable a reconstruction of the facade as hexa style, with two groups of three columns. Within the temple, an apse was discovered on its western wall, apparently intended for a statue or relief of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated. Two Greek inscriptions and two representations of eagles found in the area may indicate that this deity was Ballshamin. The dated inscriptions and decorative elements indicate a dating for the temple complex in the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE. CANAAN AT THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM BCE — AN INDEPENDENT CULTURE OR THE FINAL PHASE OF THE EARLY BRONZE AGE? by R. Amiran and M. Kokhavi (pp. 361-365) Division into archaeological periods, as with historical periods, is determined by essential changes occurring in human socie ties. Typical distinctions between different societies offer means for diagnosing and chronologically arranging cultures within a given cultural-geographical complex.</page><page sequence="14">78* ENGLISH SUMMARIES The present article re-examines the cultural-chronological data pertaining to Canaan in the third millennium CE. An settlement pattern — coming between the long urban period of most of the third millennium BCE (ca. 3,000-2,200 BCE) and the non-urban character of the last two centuries of that millennium. During this period, a northern impact is manifest in the pottery, metal and other artefacts. It is concluded that the term "Intermediate Bronze Age" — first proposed by Iliffe and adopted by many other scholars — would indeed seem to be best suited in characterizing and defining the culture of Canaan toward the end of the third millennium BCE. THE IRON AGE "FORTRESSES" OF THE NEGEV — SEDENTARIZATION OF DESERT NOMADS by I. Finkelstein (pp. 366-379) More than 45 Iron Age sites, usually defined as "Israelite fortresses", have been discovered in the Negev Highlands, but their precise date, their function and the identity of their inhabitants are still subjects of controversy. Most scholars identified them as royal fortresses established along the desert routes during the United Monarchy, and associate their de struction with Shishak's campaign. Others have understood these sites as ordinary settlements established by the tribe of Simeon or by the desert natives. In the writer's opinion, however, these sites, their layout and the associated material finds preclude defining them as for tresses. The problem of their function can now be re-examined through comparison of the open courtyard/built-up area ratio on these sites. This ratio is, in the author's view, a good indicator of the life- and subsistence-patterns of their inhabi tants. The relationship between site configuration and court yard size, together with the geographical background, shows that the ovoid-type settlements with relatively large, enclosed yards are prevalent in the southern Negev Highlands at relati vely high elevations. Thus, the inhabitants of the enclosed settlements (which undoubtedly functioned as pens for sheep and goats) preferred those areas better suited to pastoralism — mainly the higher elevations of the Negev Highlands, while the other types of Iron Age settlements tend to be located at lower elevations, more amenable to crop agriculture. In this light, the author would attribute the establishment of the Negev Highland sites to desert nomads who became sedentarized — a process reaching its zenith in the 11th centu ry BCE. This process was the result of the economic prosperity sweeping the southern deserts in the 12th-l 1th centuries CE, and it brought about the decline of pastoralism in favour of seasonal agriculture. Elements of northern material culture were absorbed by the desert tribes concurrently. The first stage of nomad sedentarization is represented by the ovoid enclo sure configuration. This layout is reminiscent of the nomadic tent and camp of the previous, pre-sedentary stage. Somewhat later, with the subsidence of the pastoral economy, the ovoid enclosure lost its utility and was replaced by new architectural forms. Better security conditions further led to settlement in isolated farmsteads. The settlement process deteriorated as the recently-established Israelite Monarchy consolidated its con trol over the southern desert. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ZODIAC IN ANCIENT SYNAGOGUES AND THEIR ICONOGRAPHIC SOURCES by G. Foerster (pp. 380-391; PL עה) The zodiac cycle is found represented at the centre of mosaic pavements in a significant number of ancient synagogues throughout Palestine in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. Although this motif was not uncommon in antiquity, as conceived and executed in the synagogues, it differed from the usual scheme based on earlier established iconography. Hellenistic Egypt, Roman Palmyra and other contemporaneous representations, as well as earlier and later iconographic material, are reviewed, establishing the Sitz im Leben of this motif in synagogal art. ON THE PRE-PLANNING OF ANCIENT CHURCHES AND SYNAGOGUES. A TEST-CASE: THE NORTHERN CHURCH AT REHOBOT IN THE NEGEV by Y. Tsafrir (pp. 392-398) The Northern Church at Rehobot in the Negev was excavated under the author's direction in 1975-79. It appears to have been a part of a monastery complex. The pre-planning of the building and the actual work of construction were studied with special regard for the modes of work of architects and artisans in the Negev and in Eretz-Israel in general. Our investigation showed that the structure was indeed pre planned, but that this was on general lines only, with little regard for details. Several basic points were noted: the length was fixed at 80 Byzantine feet; 10 Byzantine feet represented the modular unit for planning the aisles and the depth of the apse, and the portico in the atrium, while a double unit served in the northern chapel. Tracing the construction process, it was seen that the course of work was influenced by ever-new situations. Basic decisions were made during work, taking the quality of the materials into consideration. The tendency to put little effort into planning and construction was also a significant factor, and the artisans preferred minor inaccura cies (generally not visible) to additional labour in measuring. The author, in accord, holds that most public construction work in Eretz-Israel in the Roman and Byzantine periods should be regarded in a similar light, though the degree of care</page><page sequence="15">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 79* varied from place to place. (Generally, the Roman construe tion work was the more regular of the two.) The employment of overall formulas, based on theoretical and professional knowledge of a high calibre, is to be found only in complex structures of prime importance, and these are few and far between. THE OVERLAP OF CULTURES AT THE END OF THE LATE BRONZE AGE AND THE BEGINNING OF THE IRON AGE by A. Kempinski (pp. 399-407) A historical survey of the last century of Egyptian domination in Canaan, starting with the "Silver Peace" between Egypt and the Hittites and ending with the total collapse of Egyptian rule (ca. 1269-1150 BCE), seeks to show the subsistence and strength of the Canaanite culture. Parallel to the dramatic events in the political arena, a slow movement of semi nomadic elements continued to infiltrate the country, settling in the mountainous areas or the fringes of the Canaanite Egyptian sphere of influence, such as the northern Negev. Similar to other periods in the history of the Mediterranean basin, there is no actual break between the end of one period and the beginning of the next. Rather, there were quite lengthy periods of overlap. Proof for an overlap between the Canaanite and the "Israelite" culture during the 13th century BCE is found through examination of four pottery types which em phasize the borrowing process of the "Israelite" potters from the Canaanites. The pottery forms utilized to illustrate this process are (1) the collared-rim storage-jar; (2) the multi handled bowl; (3) the cooking-pot; and (4) the storage-jar. Later borrowing, such as the adoption of the beer-jug from the Philistines, are cited in order to demonstrate the long span of such a process. The Negebite and "Midianite" types of pottery are cited in order to illustrate a different cultural situation, where no borrowing occurred, thus proving the iso lation of these cultures from steady contact with the Canaanite culture. The chronological conclusions of the investigation indicate that the tendency toward raising the dates of contact between the Canaanite urban culture and the semi-nomadic "Israelite" culture is to be preferred to the tendency lowering these dates. A mid-13th century BCE date for the beginning of the process is proposed, parallelling the list of occupied cities in Joshua 12. THE MAUSOLEUM AT MAZOR by J. Kaplan (pp. 408-418; Pis. עט-עו) The monument long popularly known as "Nebi Yihye" is located on the road from Migdal Afek to Lod, near the aban doned village of Mazraca. This structure, standing out in the landscape, measures 9.4 X 10.2 m and is 4.8 m high at its facade. It is one of the few surviving Roman buildings still standing intact. The Survey of Palestine (1872-73) team pho tographed it and drew its plan, but regarded it as a curiosity. Initial trial excavations were carried out in 1964 and were continued in 1973 on behalf of the Department of Antiquities and Museums. The structure is built of fieldstones dressed only on their outer face, and there are no foundations. The courses are chinked with small stones and mortar. The portico is more carefully executed, in a degenerate Classical style. There are two rooms in the interior: an ordinary burial chamber cont aining the sarcophagus of the tomb's owner; and a second room forming a columbarium. There is no connection be tween the rooms except for a small window at the top of the partition wall between them. (The opening marked in the PEF plan was a breach made in Islamic times.) The construction of the main doorway is unique. The pro file of the doorframe, in the author's opinion, includes a dolphin head, the significance of which is related to the otho nic function of the place. The entire doorframe resembles a huge open mouth. The first chamber contains ashlar arches which support the roof of long stone slabs — a method of roofing now known to be relatively common in the region. The blocking of the entry is unusual, however, for within there had been a horizontal wooden bar which fitted into two sockets in the dootjambs. The person who bolted the door would have had to use a ladder to leave the room through the window high up the partition wall, leading into the second chamber. The opening of the second room, the columbarium, was at the top of the eastern wall. The niches, on the eastern wall, have small sills jutting out some 30 cm; and there is a rec tangular chimney in the northern part of the ceiling. There are apparently some 60 niches. The author classifies columbaria into several types and seeks to relate this sort of burial installation with Italy. It is generally considered that such columbaria did not first appear in Eretz Israel any later than 200 BCE, whereas in Rome their first appearance is ascribed to a date after the 1st century BCE. Thus, it can be assumed that this practice reached Rome (through captives) from Eretz-Israel after the country was con quered by Pompey. The monument at Mazor was apparently constructed under Diocletian, around 300 CE, but it might be one of the lastest pagan structures of its type in Eretz-Israel, built in the days of Julian the Apostate. THE EARLIEST GREEK SETTLEMENT AT DOR by Ε. Stern (pp. 419-427; Pis. 1פא-פ During the 1982 season of excavations at Tel Dor, a pit of the Persian period was cleared. Several clay figurines were found</page><page sequence="16">ENGLISH SUMMARIES within it, as well as numerous pottery sherds. The pit was probably a favissa of a nearby sanctuary, of a type well known on many other sites along the Phoenician-Israel littoral, one of which has even been found at Dor itself, in a previous season. It seems that the present favissa, however, is unique in content: almost the entire assemblage was purely Greek: either Attic or East Greek figurines and pottery. Careful examination of the many Attic sherds clearly shows that the favissa, and the associated sanctuary, had been in use between 440 and 400 BCE. It is therefore logical to assume that the sanctuary was Greek (and not Phoenician) and had been erected by Greek settlers living at Dor in this period (if not earlier). Lately, many other sites along the Phoenician-Israel coast have yielded similar finds, and it can be concluded that the Phoenician cult came under Greek influence not only as a result of Phoenician voyages to the Greek islands but also from day-to-day influence of Greek settlers on their neigh bours. TWO CHALCOLITHIC IVORY FIGURINES — TECHNIQUE AND ICONOGRAPHY by Μ. Tadmor (pp. 428-434; Pis. פג-פב) Two ivory figurines, recently added to the collections of the Israel Museum through the generosity of Mr. J. Boxenbaum, are discussed, along with the technique of ivory-carving and several iconographic-sculptural conventions in Chalcolithic representational art. The female figurine (13.5 cm high) is stylistically identical to the Beer-Sheva anthropomorphic representations in ivory. In certain details, it resembles the plaque-like figurines rather than the three-dimensional sculptures. Two stylistic features are discussed in detail: the perforations around the top of the head and, in that connection, the cavities appearing in heads of certain of the Beer-Sheva figurines. Double perforations, diagonally interconnected (as on our figurine) served for threading of facial hair and, possibly, for attaching the head to the body (through perforations at the base of the neck). Single perforations could have served to fasten a symbolic "crown"-like addition which, it is suggested, may have been inserted into the head cavity. Elephant and hippopotamus tusks were rare, expensive and hard to obtain, and the ivory cutters undoubtedly utilized all of this precious raw material. Since such tusks are partly hollow lengthwise, it is suggested that the enigmatic peculiarity of head cavities could have resulted from this specific struc tural nature of the tusk. The second figurine, 3.5 cm high, is fragmentary, only the horned head and upper torso surviving. Stylistic features, di scussed in detail, would place this figurine in the Beer-Sheva sculptural horizon as well. Despite the horns, this figurine has certain stylistic features well known from the anthropomor phic Beer-Sheva representations (round eyes, prominent nose, lack of mouth, breasts), but is entirely different from the animal heads of Gilat or of the Judean Desert hoard. There are no animal representations in the Beer-Sheva ivory assemblage and, therefore, there is no conclusive evidence pertaining to iconographic conventions of Beer-Sheva zoomorphic sculp ture. Alternately, it would be suggested that this is an anthro pomorphic representation symbolically adorned by horns. Symbolic use of horns in sculpture is a convention for which numerous examples in Chalcolithic regional traditions in this country, as well as in the sculpture of the Ancient Near East, can be cited.</page></plain_text>
