Weinstein, who saw this volume through its many editorial stages. The Festschrift was originally slated for publication in the Bulletin ofthe American Schools of Oriental Research, for which Jim is the editor. It was only when work was nearly complete that it became clear that the manuscript was too large for BASOR. At that time, Nancy Serwint graciously offered to publish it as an Annual of ASOR. I would also like to thank Susanne Wilhelm for her skillful typesetting of the volume.</page><page sequence="8">BIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM G. DEVER Those of us who were Bill Dever's students have had the unique opportunity of knowing him both as a teacher and as a friend. His love for archaeology is rivaled by his passion for teaching and so it is our pleasure to honor him with this Festschrifi volume ofthe Annualofthe American Schools of Oriental Research. Dever received his Bachelor of Arts in Religion from Milligan College in 1955. In 1959, he received his Master of Arts in Semitics from Butler College and Bachelor of Divinity in Hebrew and Greek from Christian Theological Seminary. In 1966, he received his doctorate from the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University, under the tutelage of Frank Moore Cross, Jr. and G. Ernest Wright. His dissertation was entitled The EBIV?MBI Period in Syria-Palestiney ca. 2150?1850 B. C.E. While at Harvard, Dever was introduced to archaeological fieldwork through Wright's excavation in Shechem, where he worked from 1962 to 1964 and again in the early 1970s. Dever went on to direct the Harvard Semitic Museum-Hebrew Union College Excavation at Tel Gezer from 1966 to 1971. He additionally directed the excavation of Khirbet el-Q6m and Jebel Qacaqir (1967-1971), and of Becer Resisim (1978-1980). He returned to Gezer in 1984 and 1990; the excavation of its Iron Age gateway served as a field classroom for many of Dever's masters and doctoral students. Between 1968 and 1971, Dever served as the Director ofthe Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Nelson Glueck School of Biblical Archaeology in Jerusalem. In 1971, he moved across town and directed the W F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research. He remained at the Albright until 1975, at which time he returned to the States and joined the faculty of the Department of Oriental Studies at The University of Arizona in Tucson. In addition, he held an appointment in the Department of Anthropology and was the first faculty member in the Committee on Judaic Studies. Dever retired in 2003 and now holds the position of Professor Emeritus of Syro-Palestinian Archaeology. Dever's accomplishments include fieldwork, publications and presentations, service to the archaeological community and teaching. His fieldwork is noteworthy for its methodological contributions. The Gezer project was among the first in Israel to utilize a multi-disciplinary approach to excavation and analysis. The New Archaeology brought specialists of all kinds into the field, and focussed attention on detailed stratigraphic problems. In addition, the Gezer project pioneered the concept ofthe large-scale archaeological field school (which at its peak utilized several dozen staff members and more than a hundred student volunteers). The student-directed projects atTell el-Hayyat in Jordan and Tell el-Wawiyat in Israel, which Dever sponsored with monies that otherwise could have supported a field project of his own, show his commitment to training the next generation of Near Eastern archaeologists. Dever's publication record is legendary, and includes numerous excavation reports and other books, nearly 400 articles and reviews in professional journals, volumes of collected essays and semi-popular magazines. Among his most important projects is his multi-volume publication ofthe Gezer excavation. A semi-popular book on Gezer was published in 1999, and a final volume ofthe excavation series is now being prepared. Dever's current project, nearly complete, is a trilogy of semi-popular books on ancient Israel. The first two are entitled What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It? What Archaeology Can Tell Us about the Reality of Ancient Israel (2001), and Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From? (2003). A collection of his most significant essays, entitled "For Those Who Sleep in the Dust&gt;f: Essays on the Bronze and Iron Age of Ancient Palestine, is forthcoming. Dever's publications focus on several important topics, including the Early Bronze IV, the Middle Bronze and the Iron Ages, pottery and problems of chronology. He investigates the relationship between</page><page sequence="9">biblical and Syro-Palestinian archaeology and explores archaeological method and theory. He contributes to the study of Israelite origins and Israelite religion, and most recently, to the matter of historical revisionism. An inveterate traveler and prodigious public speaker, Dever participates in conferences throughout the United States and internationally. In addition to his professional presentations, he gives popular talks, appears in television documentaries and is interviewed for newspaper and magazine articles. From The Big Dig to The Forbidden Goddess: Understanding Asherah, Dever's screen presence is noteworthy. His contributions to the academy include his work as editor of the Bulletin ofthe American Schools of Oriental Research (1978-1984) and of the Annual ofthe American Schools of Oriental Research (1984? 1997), and as a member ofthe editorial board ofa dozen journals and encyclopedias. In addition, he serves in numerous professional organizations, including the Archaeological Institute of America and especially the American Schools of Oriental Research and its overseas affiliates. He has been an officer and trustee ofthe American Schools of Oriental Research, the William F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem and Cyprus American Archaeological Institute in Nicosia. Dever has received numerous prestigious awards, including the Percia Schimmel Prize of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (1982), The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship (1981-1982), the Norton Lectureship ofthe American Institute of Archaeology (1990-1991, 2003-2004), and the P. E. MacAllister Award ofthe American Schools of Oriental Research (1997). He has received major funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution. In 1997, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion awarded him an honorary doctoral degree, the Ll.D. In 1979, Dever established the renowned graduate program in Syro-Palestinian Archaeology in the Department of Oriental Studies (later renamed, Department of Near Eastern Studies) at The University of Arizona. More than a dozen students received their M.A.s and more than twenty their Ph.D.s; several more dissertations will be defended within the next year. His students have contributed to our knowledge of periods ranging from the Early Bronze I through the Iron II. They have focussed on settlement patterns, ceramics, groundstone tools, music in antiquity, gender, religion, biblical archaeology, urbanism, rural life, astronomy, ethnoarchaeology, geographic information systems and seals. They hold positions in archaeology within the academy, in government service, in contract archaeology, in policy institutes and in museums. They are engaged in field projects in the United States, Israel, Jordan and Cyprus and are actively involved with ASOR and with its overseas affiliates, the William F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research, the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute and the American Center of Oriental Research. Dever has created a legacy as a scholar, teacher, author and advocate, and that legacy lives on through the work of his students. It is our pleasure to dedicate the essays that follow to William G. Dever, teacher, mentor, colleague and friend. Beth Alpert Nakhai Tucson, Arizona June 2003</page><page sequence="10">STUDENTS OF WILLIAM G.

Metzger and Lee Lines Archaeological assessments of early civilization in the southern Levant feature consider- able attention to a variety of major technological, economic and political transitions. Long- term studies ofthe Bronze Age often focus on the markedwaxing andwaning of urban centers and regional mercantilism. The work of William Dever has been particularly influential in offering systematic explanations for the dramatic abandonment oftown life in the late third millennium b.c.e. and its equally dramatic rebirth in the early second millennium b.c.e. This study of economic transitions between the Bronze Age villages of Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el- Hayyat, Jordan, based on fieldwork originally inspired by Dever, considers the rural agrarian shifts and continuities that lay at the foundation of Bronze Age complex society over the course of these major changes. While some trends atAbu en-Ni caj andHayyat suggest expected rural reactions to urban collapse and regeneration, others reveal elements ofpersistent agrarian behavior independent of urban influence. Tlhe development of early Near Eastern civi? lizations is particularly noteworthy for the variety of paths by which cities and states rose and collapsed. In systematic terms, cities have long been envisioned as the nuclei that integrated urban communities with each other and with the myriad villages that housed the majority of an? cient populations (e.g., Wright 1986; Clarke 1979; Redman 1978). However, early Near Eastern ur- banism was an intriguingly fragile edifice that in- corporated an inherent tension between central authorities and traditional kin-based society (Stein 1998) and, correspondingly, between cities and villages. As Adams (e.g., 1981) points out most persuasively, even in regions that were undeniable urban heartlands, the fortunes of ancient city life waxed and waned significantly and repeatedly. The prolific contributions of Bill Dever (e.g., 1980, 1987a, 1987b, 1989, 1992a, 1992b, 1995) figure prominently among archaeological assess- ments of these social dynamics of early complex societies, notably those addressing the phenom- enon of societal collapse (e.g., YofFee and Cowgill 1988; Tainter 1988; Weiss, et al. 1993; Wilkinson 1994). Dever has been especially influential in emphasizing the roles of non-urban, especially pastoral, components of "collapsed" societies in the southern Levant. This study pays tribute to BilPs inspiration, building on new attention to vil? lage communities in early complex societies (e.g., Schwartz andFalconer 1994; Wattenmaker 1998), by exploring the economic strategies practiced by rural farmers during the urban collapse and rebirth ofthe Levantine Bronze Age.</page><page sequence="12">STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. The rise of complex societies in the southern Levant (modern Israel, Palestine, and western Jor? dan) provides a particularly dramatic setting in which to specify how village communities endured processes of drastic social flux. The Levantine Bronze Age featured the advent of towns in Early Bronze II-III (ca. 2900-2300 b.c.e.), their aban- donment during Early Bronze IV (ca. 2300-2000 b.c.e.), and a dramatic rejuvenation of cities in the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1500 b.c.e.). Based on the excavations and analyses of Tell Abu en- Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat, two Bronze Age villages in the Jordan Valley, we assess agrarian economy and its implications for refming current interpre? tations, inspired largely by Dever, of the impacts of Early Bronze IV urban collapse and Middle Bronze Age reurbanization. BRONZE AGE SOCIAL DYNAMICS Syntheses of early Levantine social collapse (e.g., Prag 1974; Dever 1980, 1995; Finkelstein 1989; Palumbo 1987, 1991) build on several sa- lient characteristics of Early Bronze IV material culture and settlement patterns: 1) Virtually all Levantine cities and towns were abandoned by the end of Early Bronze III. 2) In striking contrast to those in preceding and succeeding periods, Early Bronze IV sites are small, often seasonal, and distributed com? monly in the arid margins ofthe southern Le? vant. 3) Following Early Bronze IV, urbanized settle? ments redeveloped in the Middle Bronze Age even more rapidly than they were abandoned previously. 4) Early Bronze IV ceramics, lithics, and metal implements are stylistically and technically distinct from those in preceding and, espe? cially, succeeding periods. In light of these features, Early Bronze IV has been portrayed as an abrupt and anomalous punc- tuation in the development of Levantine complex society during which the basis for agrarian urban- ism was abandoned overwhelmingly in favor of non-sedentary settlement and transhumant sheep/ goat pastoralism (see Prag 1974; Dever 1980 for classic syntheses). However, a variety of tantaliz- ing considerations now suggest that we should balance this emphasis on non-sedentary pastoral? ism with greater attention to the roles of seden? tary villages and their constituent households dur? ing periods both with and without urban centers: 1) Near Eastern historic and ethnographic ac- counts document a fimdamental interdepen- dence between sedentary farmers and non-sed? entary pastoralists that also must have held true in the more distant past (e.g., Kramer 1982; Gilead 1991; Levy 1991; Finkelstein 1991). 2) Through the 1970s, sedentary Early Bronze IV settlements had been excavated in small exposures at relatively few sites, primarily in Jordan (e.g., Parr 1960; Cleveland 1960; Olavarri 1969; Prag 1974; Rast and Schaub 1978). However, more recent systematic re- connaissance (e.g., Gophna and Portugali 1988; Palumbo 1991; Ibrahim, Sauer and Yassine 1976, 1988) has revealed numerous sedentary Early Bronze IV sites throughout the southern Levant, and broader excavations (e.g., at Tell Umm Hammad [Helms 1986]) provide a more detailed glimpse of village ar? chitecture and material culture, including at least one example of a fortified settlement at Khirbet Iskander, Jordan (Richard 1990; Ri- chard and Long 1995). 3) Analysis of survey data from the Mediterra? nean coastal plain suggests that Early Bronze IV settlement patterns strongly resemble the rural components ofthe urbanized systems of Early Bronze II-III and the Middle Bronze Age (e.g., Falconer and Savage 1995: 52-53, fig. 10). Although most Early Bronze IV sites oc- cupy new locations, this unexpected result sug? gests a persistent element of rural settlement amid the waxing and waning of Levantine cities. In light of these characteristics, village communi- ties like Tell Abu en-Ni aj and Tell el-Hayyat take on special importance as points of sedentary/non- sedentary articulation within the social fabric of the Levantine Bronze Age, and as touchstones for linking the rural foundations of early civilization through periods of pronounced city life, its aban? donment, and its rebirth.</page><page sequence="13">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY LEBANON Sea of Galilee/ SYRIA Area enlarged at right ?Amman JORDAN ?

BRONZE AGE VILLAGE ECONOMY AT TELL ABU EN-NICAJ AND TELL EL-HAYYAT Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat embody the remains of small Bronze Age farming settle? ments in the ghor, the broad, fertile agricultural terrace above the active stream channel ofthe Jor? dan River (fig. 1). Tell Abu en-Ni caj (North) lies approximately 250 m below sea level, perched on Pleistocene lacustrine clay overlooking the zor, the present floodplain of the Jordan River (Ibrahim, Sauer and Yassine 1976: 51, site 64). Tell el- Hayyat, a low mound (4 m high), rises from Ho- locene alluvium 1.5 km to the northeast of Nicaj, and about ten meters higher in elevation (Ibrahim, Sauer and Yassine 1976: 51-54, site 56). Judging from population densities in traditional Middle Eastern villages (generally 200-250 people/ha, see e.g., Kramer 1982), Nicaj (2.5 ha) had 500 to 600 inhabitants in Early Bronze IV, while Hayyat (0.5 ha) housed only 100 to 125 people during the Middle Bronze Age. The climate of the southern Levant is decid- edly Mediterranean with mild, rainy winters and long, hot summers. Today, mean annual rainfall of 200-300 mm and a mean annual temperature above 20? C permit year-round dry farming in the Jordan Valley (Horowitz 1979: 20-22, 28-33). Wheat {Triticum aestivum/T. compactum) fields in the vicinity of Hayyat and Nicaj generally are rainfed, while other nearby fields and orchards are irrigated from the King Abdullah Canal, which diverts water from the Yarmouk River, the north- ern-most tributary ofthe Jordan River (30 km north of these sites). In antiquity, irrigation water could</page><page sequence="14">STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. have been obtained only with some technical dif- ficulty from the Jordan River (50 m lower in el? evation and 1-2 km to the west) or from a perma? nent spring at the foot ofthe ancient town of Pella, 7 km to the northeast. The latter possibility would have necessitated cooperation with Pella's inhab? itants who, no doubt, controlled the spring. Archaeological excavations at Tell el-Hayyat in 1982, 1983, and 1985 (Falconer and Magness- Gardiner 1983a, 1983b, 1984, 1989, 1991) ex? posed approximately 8% of the site area, reveal- ing six strata of village architecture to a total depth of 4.5 m at the center ofthe mound (figs. 2 and 3). Habitation at Hayyat began late in Early Bronze IV and continued without interruption through the end ofthe Middle Bronze Age. Phases 5 through 2 provide robust data for village life during Middle Bronze IIA, IIB, and IIC, including the remains of four stratified temples in antis (see Magness- Gardiner and Falconer 1994; Falconer and Magness-Gardiner 1999). Excavations at Tell Abu en-Nicaj in 1985,1996/97, and2000 (Falconerand Magness-Gardiner 1989; Falconer, Fall and Jones 1998, 2001) covered about 2.5% ofthe site area, exposing 3.3 m of Early Bronze IV cultural de? posits with seven major strata of mud brick archi? tecture (figs. 4 and 5). We will discuss evidence from the upper five phases in Field 4 at Tell Abu en-Nicaj (Phases 5-1). The stratified remains of Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat jointly span the roughly eight hun- dred-year course of Early Bronze IV and the Middle Bronze Age (Table 1). The pottery from Nicaj Phase 7 includes a few Early Bronze II/III sherds, placing the beginning ofthe Ni caj sequence very early in Early Bronze IV The vessel forms from Nicaj Phase 1 resemble those from the lim? ited assemblage of Hayyat Phase 6, suggesting that both phases date to the end of Early Bronze IV and provide a chronological connection between the two sites. In the following discussions we link floral and faunal data from nine strata at Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat that illuminate the course of rural agrarian economy during the most dramatic episodes of urban abandonment and re- development in the ancient Levant. During the Bronze Age many basic character? istics ofthe communities at Ni caj and Hayyat were Fig. 2 Topographic plan of Tell el-Hayyat showing units excavated in 1982, 1983, and 1985. very similar: they were roughly comparable in size, environmental situation, and general agrarian ori? entation (Falconer and Magness-Gardiner 1989; Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). The most signifi? cant social factor that differed between the two communities, and thus probably inspired their dif? ferent behaviors, was the presence or absence of Levantine towns and cities. Thus, Ni caj and Hayyat provide a controlled comparison of rural responses to urban collapse and redevelopment. In particu? lar, we consider trends within and between the Nicaj and Hayyat sequences to assess the nature and severity of the economic transition between the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, the phenom- enon that lies at the very heart of Dever's inter? pretations of Bronze Age society. Regional Exchange of Manufactured Goods Completed analyses of ceramics and lithics from Tell Abu en-Nicaj and Tell el-Hayyat focus on patterns of regional exchange. Neutron activa? tion analysis suggests that the villagers at Tell el- Hayyat were using locally-made coarseware cook? ing pots and jars, as well as fineware bowls from a variety of sources including, surprisingly, Tell el-Hayyat itself (Falconer 1987). This result pro? vides less distinct evidence of exchange with Middle Bronze Age manufacturing towns than</page><page sequence="15">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY Fig. 3 Excavations at Tell el-Hayyat, 1983. Facing southwest across the fields of the ghor, toward the Jordan River. (Photo by Jon Kline.) expected. Archaeometric analysis of jars and cups from Tell Abu en-Nicaj and other villages docu? ments rural exchange in the eastern Jordan Valley during Early Bronze IV (Jones 1999). Jointly, these studies suggest a pattern of localized village-level production and exchange that persisted through the abandonment and redevelopment of Bronze Age towns and cities. On the other hand, analysis of lithic data shows a clearer discontinuity between Nicaj and Hayyat, with an unexpected expression of urban influence. The stone tool assemblage from Nicaj includes abundant, minimally retouched, prismatic ("Canaa nean") blades from non-local chert sources (Barton, Lindly and Falconer 1990), in keeping with Rosen's (1983) hypothesis of centralized manufacture and long-distance exchange of Early Bronze IV blades. In contrast, the Middle Bronze II blade assemblage from Hayyat primarily in? cludes truncated, heavily retouched blade segments produced from local raw materials. This evidence Fig. 4 Topographic plan of Tell Abu en-Nicaj showing units excavated in 1985, 1996/97 and 2000.</page><page sequence="16">STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. Fig. 5 Excavations at Tell Abu en-Nfaj, 1997. Facing northwest across the zor to the Beth Shan Valley. (Photo by S. Falconer.) suggests that blade exchange became constrained over the Early Bronze IV/Middle Bronze transi? tion, and that despite their integrative potential, emerging Middle Bronze Age polities (and their boundaries) may have impeded, rather than facili- tated, this form of trade (Barton, Lindly and Fal? coner 1990; Hurlbut 1997). Our working interpretations of manufactured commodities from Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el- Hayyat do not indicate a distinct change from dis? articulated exchange in Early Bronze IV to more centralized exchange in the Middle Bronze Age, as might be predicted by orthodox approaches to urban collapse and redevelopment. Instead, these villages signal a complex weave of dynamic ex? change networks over the Early Bronze/Middle Bronze transition, with unexpected evidence of long-distance lithic exchange in Early Bronze IV, its absence in Middle Bronze II, and persistent rural networks of pottery exchange in both periods. Herd and Crop Management As suggested above, the economic patterns at Nicaj and Hayyat, in varying combinations, may reflect distinctly different responses to urban col? lapse and resurgence or, alternatively, rural behav- iors that persisted at the foundation of Levantine civilization regardless ofthe presence or absence of cities. A detailed portrait of rural economy and ecology emerges from depositional patterns of ani? mal bones and plant fragments that show a variety of continuities and discontinuities in herd and crop management between Early Bronze IV and Middle Bronze II (see also Falconer 1995; Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). The examples below compare data from earthen surfaces excavated at Hayyat (all three seasons) and Nicaj (1985 and 1996/97 sea? sons). These contexts highlight "primary" refuse deposited in original use areas and "de facto" refuse left behind when a structure was abandoned (Schiffer 1987), and minimize the influences of</page><page sequence="17">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY Table 1.

Estimated phase dates for Tell el- Hayyat are based on regional ceramic chronologies. Estimated phase dates for Tell Abu en-Ni caj simply assume roughly equal occupation spans. chronologically mixed deposits and "secondary" refuse away from original use areas (Deal 1985). To his credit, Dever has repeatedly revised his assessments of Bronze Age society as new evi? dence has arisen. His "trial formulation" of the Early Bronze IV period now suggests a "tribal" society characterized by "largely pastoral nomadic subsistence" with "a dispersed pattern of non-ur- ban settlement" (1995: 295). His concept of Early Bronze IV "ruralism" (1992b) accommodates sed? entary farming alongside pastoral nomadism, ar- guing that kin-based villages emerged late in the period as "pastoral nomads were becoming sed? entary" (1995: 295). We offer this study as a test of many, though certainly not all, aspects of this formulation, which continues to guide most discussions of Early Bronze/Middle Bronze social transitions. Dever's arguments suggest three general expected patterns for animal husbandry and crop management at vil? lages like Tell Abu en-Nicaj. First, given Dever's continued emphasis on Early Bronze IV pastoral nomadism, data from Tell Abu en-Ni caj (especially early in its occupation) should reflect a greater emphasis on non-sedentary subsistence, including mobile herding, especially of goats (Capra hircus), and opportunistic cultivation of annual crops. In contrast, Middle Bronze Age Tell el-Hayyat should indicate much more sedentary agricultural subsis? tence, with more diversified animal husbandry, and greater emphasis on perennial crops. Second, the proposal that villages emerged late in Early Bronze IV as artifacts of sedentarization suggests that evidence for non-sedentary subsis? tence should be more pronounced during the ear? lier phases at Tell Abu en-Ni caj, and should reveal trends toward greater sedentism later in the Nicaj sequence. Third, with the abandonment of towns through the entire Early Bronze IV period, Tell Abu en- Ni caj should offer little evidence at any point in its sequence for the management of animals and plants that produced marketable commodities. In contrast, phase-by-phase data from Tell el-Hayyat should indicate enhanced management of animals and plants that produce secondary commodities (e.g., sheep [Ovis aries] and orchard crops) due to the impetus of Middle Bronze Age mercantile cen? ters (e.g., Pella and Beth Shan).</page><page sequence="18">STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. Animal Management and Consumption. All ex? cavated sediments from both sites were screened through 0.5 cm mesh screen, permitting the recov? ery of more than 30,000 identifiable animal bone fragments analyzed in this study (Metzger 1983a, 1983b, 1984a, 1984b; Falconer and Magness- Gardiner 1989). Our analyses utilize NISP (num? ber of identifiable specimens) bone counts follow? ing various arguments (e.g., Crabtree 1990: 159? 60; Redding 1992) that NISP is preferable to MNI (minimum number of individuals) for comparing relative abundances of various taxa over time and space (cf. Grayson 1984: 94-96 for a dissenting opinion). The common use of NISP in literature pertaining to the Near East (e.g., Meadow and Zeder 1978; Clutton-Brock 1979; Hellwing and Gophna 1984; Horwitz 1989; Zeder 1991; Redding 1992) also recommends its use, particularly for comparative purposes. The surfaces in Hayyat phases 5-3 produce total NISP values ranging be? tween 700 and 880 per phase. Hayyat Phase 2, which included many fewer undisturbed surfaces, produced a smaller faunal assemblage, which is excluded from this discussion. Nicaj phases 4-2 provide NISP counts from 290 to 550 per phase, whereas phases 5 and 1 presently offer only about 100 identified bones each. More than 93 percent of the identifiable ani? mal bones recovered from Nicaj and Hayyat rep? resent domesticated sheep {Ovis aries), goat {Capra hircus), pig {Sus scrofa) and cattle {Bos taurus; Metzger 1983a, 1983b, 1984a, 1984b; Fal? coner and Magness-Gardiner 1989; Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). As with most agrarian communi- ties in the Near East, the majority of bones repre? sent sheep and goat. The relative frequency of ovicaprid bones shows an overall decrease through Early Bronze IV at Nicaj (phases 5-1) and the Middle Bronze Age at Hayyat (phases 5-3; fig. 6). The higher values at Nicaj reflect more sheep/ goat consumption and may suggest a greater ele? ment of mobile pastoralism in keeping with cur? rent models of rural ecology during urban collapse (e.g., Dever 1995). Moreover, the ratio of sheep to goat shows a general trend from a roughly 2 to 1 predominance of goat early at Nicaj to a greater than 3 to 1 majority of sheep by Hayyat Phase 3 (Table 2). Rising sheep/goat ratios usually suggest increasingly market-driven animal husbandry, since sheep carry more meat and generate more "secondary products" (especially wool), which are renewable and well-suited for transport and ex? change (Sherratt 1981, 1983; Davis 1984; Zeder 1991: 38). Less market-oriented husbandry is sug? gested by the generally lower sheep:goat ratios at Nicaj, especially in its earlier phases. Interestingly, the long-term shift toward sheep begins at Early Bronze IV Nicaj and, therefore, may not be en- tirely attributable to market influences. The pig bone frequencies at both sites are un- expectedly high, and significantly greater than those for most Near Eastern Bronze Age commu- nities, which produce values more commonly around 10% (e.g., Wapnish and Hesse 1988; Horwitz 1989; Hesse 1990: tables 1 and 2). Low pig frequencies elsewhere reflect the relatively high water needs of pigs and their poor suitability for mobile pastoralism (Horwitz 1989; Hesse 1990; 1995). In the cases of Nicaj and Hayyat, swine herds may have been watered at the nearby Jor? dan River (Falconer 1995). The relative frequency of pig bones rises clearly in phases 4-2 at Nicaj, but the longer term trend between phases 5 and 1 shows only a slight net increase. The pig bone fre? quencies for Nicaj lead directly to comparable val? ues at Hayyat, which then show a more pronounced rise. In contrast to the ovicaprid data, enhanced pig deposition generally reflects a growing em? phasis on household-based subsistence economy. Pigs provide few secondary products and are poorly suited for herding to market (Wapnish and Hesse 1988; Horwitz 1989; Horwitz andTchernov 1989). On the other hand, swine produce large numbers of offspring, can subsist as domestic scav- engers, and may be managed effectively by indi? vidual families (Grigson 1982; Zeder 1991: 30; Hesse 1995). Therefore, increasing pig frequen? cies imply accentuated economic autonomy at both village and household levels. When compared with Hayyat, the lower pig frequencies atNicaj (except for Phase 2) might again suggest the greater im? portance of mobile sheep/goat pastoralism. We should note, however, that the frequencies of Sus at Ni caj still easily exceed those for most Levantine Bronze Age communities (cf. Clutton-Brock 1979; Hellwing and Gophna 1984; Wapnish and Hesse</page><page sequence="19">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY Ni'aj Hayyat Fig. 6 Relative frequencies ojdomesticated faunal remains excavated from domestic contexts at Tell el-Hayyat and Tell Abu en-Nicaj. 1988; Horwitz 1989), so swine husbandry also fig- ured prominently. Given the high water require- ments and non-herding tendencies of pigs, the ubiquity of Sus bones at Nicaj and Hayyat sug? gests that both communities were largely seden? tary. Spatial patterns of bone deposition reinforce the domestic orientation of pig management at Tell el-Hayyat. Phases 4 and 3 have sufiiciently robust faunal assemblages to show an increasingly dis? tinct pattern of pig butchering in alleys (suggested especially by cranial fragments) and domestic con? sumption in household interiors and courtyards (reflected largely by limb and trunk elements; Fal? coner 1995: Table 2). While the segregation of pig body segments at Hayyat becomes more pro? nounced between Phases 4 and 3, the ovicaprid data for these phases show the opposite trend in which the distinctions between interior and exte? rior bone deposition became insignificant by Phase Table 2. Sheep to goat ratios from domestic contexts at Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat, based on NISP identifiable as Ovis or Capra. Data are presented in pairs of phases from Nicaj due to small sample sizes. 3 (Falconer 1995: table 3). These results suggest that with increased domestic pig consumption, ovicaprid bone elements provide a less distinct signature of household diet, in keeping with the apparently greater market orientation of sheep/goat management at Hayyat. Bos bone deposition is particularly notewor- thy since overall beef consumption at the two sites was roughly comparable to that of sheep and goat mutton, given the much higher meat weight of cattle (Grigson 1995: fig. 4). Cattle bones reveal the clearest faunal discontinuity, in which frequen? cies rise gradually through the Nicaj sequence be? fore giving way to a much higher value in Hayyat Phase 5 and then declining values in phases 4 and 3. The increase through Nicaj may suggest the in? creased importance of cattle as traction animals. The drop in cattle frequency at Hayyat follows naturally from the shift toward sheep husbandry through the Middle Bronze Age, since cattle are grazers that compete for forage more often with sheep, which both graze and browze, than with goats, which prefer browsing (Redding 1984). However, rising cattle frequencies at Nicaj coin- cide with increasing sheep:goat ratios, revealing that herding strategies incorporated factors other than feeding complementarity or competition. Our current interpretations show several un- expected trends in animal management and con? sumption at Nicaj: declining sheep/goat consump? tion, significant swine management, and increas? ing cattle deposition. Perhaps most intriguingly,</page><page sequence="20">10 STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. the general trends in sheep/goat and pig deposi? tion at Hayyat may not be attributable entirely to urban resurgence since they generally continue those seen at Nicaj during city abandonment. Consumption and Exchange of Plant Products. A total of 151 samples from Hayyat and 60 samples from Ni caj (averaging 6 liters each) were collected non-randomly from localities which clearly con? tained carbonized remains (Fall 1983). Simple water flotation (Pearsall 1989) was used to extract more than 12,000 identifiable plant specimens, including seeds, fruits, and rachis segments. Be? cause sample volumes differed (ranging between 1 and 20 liters each), density ratios (number of seeds/sample volume) were computed to standard- ize the floral data (after Miller 1988; Pearsall 1989). These values, expressed as the number of fragments per kiloliter, do not necessarily reflect the relative importance of each crop in any given stratum, but they permit extremely valuable com? parisons of the incidence of plant taxa between strata and between the two villages (Pearsall 1989; Miller 1988). Tell el-Hayyat and Tell Abu en-Ni caj produced very similar overall frequencies of plant macro- fossils from four main categories: cultivated cere? als, cultivated legumes, fruit-bearing trees and vines, and wild species indicative of pastures and agricultural fields (Fall 1983; Lines 1995; Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). Hayyat phases 5-2 av? erage almost 900 identifiable plant fragments each, whereas Nicaj provides 500-750 macrofossils from each of phases 3 and 4, and fewer than 300 from phases 1, 2 and 5. Cereal grains at both sites include einkorn {Triticum monococcum), emmer (T. dicoccum), bread wheat (7! aestivumlT. compactum), oat (Avena sativa), rye (Secale cereale), and barley in both hulled {Hordeum vulgare) and naked variet- ies {H. vulgare var. nudum; Fall 1983; Lines 1995). Fruits include domesticated fig {Ficus carica), olive {Olea europaea), and grape {Vitus vinifera), as well as uncultivatedPro^cp/^. All ofthe weeds, wild grasses, and wild legumes recovered from Nicaj and Hayyat would have been prevalent in agricultural fields or disturbed areas. Among cereal grains, we might predict that remains of animal fodder would be relatively more abundant at Nicaj, during the "pastoralization" of Early Bronze IV. In traditional agricultural sys? tems, hulled varieties of barley are preferred for animal fodder, while naked forms are favored as food (Zohary and Hopf 1988). However, hulled barley is the most common cultivated cereal at both villages, producing three to seven times more macrofossils than the naked form. Another source of animal fodder, the uncultivated fruit from Prosopis (Helbaek 1966) also is abundant at both sites. Long-term trends show fluctuating barley densities early at Nicaj, giving way to a declining trend through the Hayyat sequence (fig. 7). Wheat densities show less variability, remain- ing relatively static through Nicaj and reaching higher densities at Hayyat, with an upward trend in its later phases. Overall, a clear early predomi- nance of barley gives way to similar wheat and barley densities during the latter half ofthe Middle Bronze Age. When compared to wheat, barley has long been the more expedient crop choice in the Near East, since it requires less water, is more tol- erant of saline soils, and is less susceptible to in- sects due to its shorter growing season (McCreery 1980; Hopf 1983; Zohary 1982; Zohary and Hopf 1988). The shift to more demanding wheat culti? vation may reflect wheaf s superiority as a source of baking flour (Zohary 1982) and correspondingly greater market value. Although all varieties of wheat (einkorn, emmer, and bread wheat) are more common at Hayyat, the frequency of bread wheat in particular jumps to seven times its value at Ni caj. The Jordan Valley provides precisely the agricul? tural characteristics favorable for wheat cultiva? tion, making bread wheat a potentially valuable commodity for local trade. The influence of regional exchange on rural agriculture is most apparent when considering evidence for fruit cultivation. Rendered fruit prod? ucts (e.g., olive oil, wine, dried figs) provide rela? tively low bulk, highly storable and transportable commodities that are much better suited for re? gional exchange than more perishable, higher bulk annual grains and legumes. Remains of domesti? cated fig, olive, and grape are surprisingly frequent at Nicaj, as well as Hayyat, although the relative</page><page sequence="21">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY 11 .3 B *?$ "o "35 1?

Unlike the data for grain cultivation summarized above, the den- sities of orchard taxa show a basic change from a predominance of grape seeds at Nicaj to olive pits at Hayyat (fig. 8). The apparent shift to greater olive cultivation signals a serious increase in lo? cal agricultural investment. Successful olive cul? tivation requires extensive landholdings since ol? ive trees have broad root systems requiring orchard spacing often meters between trees (Turrill 1952). This shift is especially pronounced in Hayyat phases 4 and 3, suggesting it was inspired by the mercantile opportunities afforded by developing urbanism during the course ofthe Middle Bronze Age. Ratios of annual to perennial plant macrofos- sils suggest the relative consumption levels of lo? cal subsistence crops (i.e., annual cereals and le? gumes) versus those with greater potential for lo? cal or regional trade (i.e., perennial fruits). The patterning of ovicaprid and pig bones provides evi? dence of domestic consumption in household in- teriors, and trash disposal in exterior alleyways (Falconer 1995: 408, tables 2 and 3). Similarly, the domestic orientation of cereal and legume pro? duction at Hayyat is suggested by annuakperennial ?3 '"o fc 3001 308 100 50-1 Grape Olive 54321 5 432 Phase Ni'aj Hayyat Fig. 8 Density ratios for grape and olive remains excavated from domestic contexts at Tell el-Hayyat and Tell Abu en-Nicaj. ratios in Phases 4 and 3 that are much higher in household interior debris than in exterior trash (Falconer 1995: table 5). These floral data clearly reflect sedentary farming strategies at both Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat, with a growing emphasis on crops with greater market potential, as wheat became relatively more dominant among cereals and fruit cultivation shifted from grape to olive. DISCUSSION This profile of agrarian economy at Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat highlights a number of intriguing and often counterintuitive character? istics that may be considered in light of our hy- potheses above. Those hypotheses, derived from the models proposed by Bill Dever, predict: 1) mobile, mixed herding and cultivation at Abu en-Ni caj, contrasted with dedicated sedentary ag? riculture at Hayyat; 2) a trend of sedentarization at Abu en-Nicaj; and 3) subsistence based economy at Abu en-Ni caj, followed by the introduction of mercantile influences and growing market partici- pation by the farmers of Hayyat. In light ofthe importance ascribed to less sed? entary settlement and non-mercantile economy in Early Bronze IV, Tell Abu en-Ni caj provides ex- pected evidence of greater production of barley</page><page sequence="22">12 STEVEN FALCONER ET AL. than wheat among cereals, and a virtual absence of olive remains among fruits (see also Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). The evidence from Tell el- Hayyat reveals a variety of rural responses to the opportunities and inroads of growing Middle Bronze Age urban centers and political authority. Increased production of olives, wheat, sheep, and their marketable products suggests that Hayyat's farmers clearly availed themselves of commercial opportunities in local towns such as Pella. Intrigu- ingly, these fairly predictable behaviors were bal? anced by unexpected trends of declining beef con? sumption and, especially, escalating swine hus? bandry. This combination suggests that the increas? ingly mercantile elements of Hayyat's agricultural regime were tempered by strategies to enhance local economic autonomy (see discussions in Magness-Gardiner and Falconer 1994; Falconer 1995; Fall, Lines and Falconer 1998). Tell Abu en-Nicaj also reveals unanticipated trends of increased consumption of cattle and pos? sibly swine, two taxa denoting sedentism and strik- ingly absent from traditional Near Eastern special? ized pastoralism. These trends are coupled with a notable decrease in sheep/goat consumption through Early Bronze IV This trend could sug? gest an unexpected decline in the importance of sheep/goat husbandry, or a reflection of more spe? cialized off-site pastoralism that entailed less on- site domestic consumption. Although many of these results support our working hypotheses, several nuances challenge us to amend our preconceptions about Bronze Age ruralism. Whereas sheep/goat pastoralism and bar? ley cultivation were especially prominent at Tell Abu en-Ni caj, both settlements exemplify largely sedentary communities through their entire occu- pations. The drop in sheep/goat consumption at Abu en-Ni caj may reflect increased sedentism, but more likely signals one component of a suite of economic changes through Early Bronze IV These characteristics are particularly noteworthy at Abu en-Ni caj, given the current paucity of excavated Early Bronze IV villages. Hayyat's market-orien- tation, while clearly greater than that of Abu en- Ni caj, was tempered significantly, rather than sim? ply accentuated, during the growth of local towns. Most strikingly, rather than reflecting a fimdamen- tal distinction between deurbanized Early Bronze IV pastoralism and reurbanized Middle Bronze Age village life, these data and their interpreta? tions suggest comparably multi-faceted and dy- namic regimes of sedentary agriculture at both Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat. CONCLUSIONS At a basic level, the shifting nature of plant and animal management at Tell el-Hayyat is unsurprising, given the probable influences of emerging polities during the Middle Bronze Age. However, the comparably fluid agricultural regime at Tell Abu en-Ni caj seems, at first blush, unex- pected. These observations reveal an assumption implicit in the general model of deurbanized, largely pastoral Early Bronze IV society. With the apparently pervasive abandonment of Levantine towns by the end of Early Bronze III, and the sub? sequent absence of their economic influences, we may too readily assume that regional and local economies should have been essentially static over the course of Early Bronze IV (or at least signifi? cantly less dynamic than in the Middle Bronze Age). Our interpretations of agriculture at Tell Abu en-Ni caj, particularly in comparison with Tell el- Hayyat, suggest that this assumption is untenable. In the spirit of Bill Dever's willingness to read- just the general model of Early Bronze IV society, we argue for a new perspective on the transition from the deurbanized Early Bronze IV to the reurbanized Middle Bronze Age in the southern Levant. Many ofthe alterations in animal and crop management find their most pronounced expres- sions within the sequences at Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat, rather than at the chronologi? cal interface between these settlements. Perhaps most surprisingly, many trends, particularly in ani? mal management, play out over the entire se? quences at Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat. Their course becomes apparent only over perhaps eight hundred years, rather than the century or two normally ascribed to the Early Bronze IV/Middle Bronze transition.</page><page sequence="23">BRONZE AGE RURAL ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN THE JORDAN VALLEY 13 These observations hold at least two general archaeological implications. First, social and eco? nomic transitions, which are of abiding interest for archaeology, require interpretation amid long- term perspectives. This study of coordinated data from Tell Abu en-Ni caj and Tell el-Hayyat builds on the ideas of Bill Dever to provide a longer term perspective on Bronze Age economic dynamics in the southern Levant. Second, this study signals the need for inter? pretations of early rural communities, not simply as antitheses of towns and cities, but as they re- veal a foundation of ruralism essential to all com? plex agrarian societies, with its own trends of ag? ricultural adjustment and readjustment, whether in the face of urbanization or during its complete absence.

Two issues recently raised by A. F Rainey, namely the interpretation of the phrase bn prt.f "his seed is not" and the identification of Israel on the Karnak Reliefs, deserve further analysis due to their implications. The present study will concentrate on the immediate context ofthe Merenptah inscriptions and reliefs be? fore engaging a much wider survey of contemporaneous Egyptian, Canaanite, Hittite, and Assyrian military accounts which establish that the destruction of subsistence sources was a common military tactic during the second millennium. Together with a reanalysis ofthe reliefs from the broader perspective of Egyptian iconography this study suggests that Israel was an agricultural, socioethnic entity without a city-state support system within Canaan and that Israel was already powerful enough to warrant the attention given by Merenptah in 1209 b.c.e. Every reconstruction of ancient Israel is in- evitably faced with the widely discussed single mention of the entity Israel in the Merenptah stela" (Hasel 1994: 45). The truth of this statement published almost a decade ago is attested by a dozen new histories or collected works (Lemche 1993; Finkelstein and Na'aman 1994; Fritz 1996; Whitelam 1996; Coogan 1998; Isserlin 1998; Kamm 1999; Thompson 1999; Coogan 1998; King and Stager 2001; Soggin 2001; Dever 2001, 2003), as well as specialized studies on Israelite ethnicity (Dever 1995; Finkelstein 1996; Edelman 1996; Sparks 1998), and others dealing directly with Merenptah's campaign (Kruchten 1994;Nibbi 1996;Niccacci 1997; Yurco 1997, 1998; Kitchen 1997; Whitelam 2000; Gorg 2001; Rainey 2001). In my initial article I assessed current positions and made suggestions concern- ing the implications of the military terminology and poetic structure used by the Egyptians?is? sues that I felt were significant to remedy numer? ous misconceptions and to further stimulate dis? cussion (Hasel 1994). This goal was achieved with a recent article by A. F. Rainey (2001), which ex- tensively interacts with my early work and my re? cent book on Egyptian military activity during the New Kingdom (Hasel 1998a, but see also 1998b). Two of the issues raised in Rainey's article de- serve attention and it is only because they are so vital to our understanding of early Israel that they are readdressed here. The first relates to the focus of Egyptian military activity against Israel. Did the Egyptian scribe write ofthe destruction ofthe progeny/offspring of Israel or did he boast ofthe destruction of Israel's agricultural produce or grain? The answer to this question may give fiir- 19</page><page sequence="29">20 MICHAELG. HASEL ther insight concerning Israel's socio-economic status and, as I have argued, may lend weight to the hypothesis that Israel already "functioned as an agriculturally-based/sedentary socio-ethnic en? tity in the late thirteenth century b.c.e." (Hasel 1994: 54). Rainey disagrees with this position and supports his argument for a pastoralist Israel by restating his interpretation of the Karnak reliefs, which he believes depict Israel as the "foes of Shasu." Both issues relate directly to the nature of Israel as understood by the Egyptians in the New Kingdom as they encountered this people resid- ing in the Egyptian-controlled territory of Canaan (Weinstein 1981). I will begin with the interpreta? tion ofthe termprt, "seed," before addressing the reliefs at Karnak. THE TEBMprt AND EGYPTIAN SOURCES The phrase ysrylr/lfkt bnprt.f "Israel is laid waste, his grain is not," and specifically the inter? pretation ofthe t&amp;rm prt as an agricultural element, stems back to the original translation of the Merenptah stela by W. Spiegelberg in 1896. Spiegelberg (1896: 23) translated^r/ as "Saaten" (seed for planting) based on the same contextual references later cited and augmented by Breasted.1 That same year Steindorf (1896: 331) translated the noun as "Frucht" (fruit), followed by Breasted (1897:66) who affirmed the translation as "grain." By the turn of the century this was the accepted translation. A decade later Breasted (1906: 258) changed his translation to the word "seed" and corrected the misconceived notion that this text referred to the killing of the male children of Is? rael recorded in Ex 1: 22. While others continued to translate/?r/ in the Merenptah stela as "grain" (Ahlstrom 1991: 32 n. 52) or "seed for planting" {Saatgut; Spiegelberg 1908: 404 n. 5; Kaplony- Heckel 1985:552; Hasel 1994,1998a, 1998b; Edel in Fritz 1996: 73-75), Breasted was followed by those who translated the phrase generically as "seed" (Erman 1923: 346; Williams 1958: 139; Fecht 1983:120; Hornung 1983:232), or with the intended meaning of progeny or offspring (von Beckerath 1951:66; Wilson 1969:378 n. 18; Helck 1971: 240; Yurco 1986: 211; Niccacci 1997: 92- 93; Hoffmeier 1997: 28; Rainey 2001: 63). General Lexicography Two major meanings are possible for the noun prt. The first definition from Erman and Grapow's authoritative Worterbuch includes, "Frucht einer Pflanze; I. Frucht eines Baumes; II. Besonders: Feldfrucht 11; Getreide 12; Saatkorn 13." The sec? ond meaning is "B. Same = Nachkommenschaft; I. Allgemein: Nachkommen, Kinder 1" (1926-31: 530-31). In their Handworterbuch (1961: 54) the same two meanings are provided with less detail, while Faulkner (1962: 91) defmes the term as "fruit; seed; [also] in the sense of'offspring,' 'pos- terity'." Lesko (1982:177) simply gives the mean? ing "seed." In those contexts when prt means "grain" (german: Korn) and "seed for planting" (german: Saatgut) three determinatives are used separately or conjunctively: (1) \# "plow," (Gardiner 1957: 517, U13) although not exclu- sively {Wb, 1, 531), (2) ^ "grains of corn" (Gardiner 1957: 483, M33); and (3) 0 "grain of sand" (Gardiner 1957: 490, N33; Wb, 1, 530). Helck pointed out that while prt may refer to seed (for planting), it may generally be understood as grain (1984: 321; cf. Janssen 1961: 82). In other cases prt may refer to seeds of spices and season- ings when associated with certain colors (Helck 1976: 594). As Rainey points out, a second mean? ing occurs in some contexts where prt is best un? derstood as descendants or offspring. The contex- tual usage is the clear determiner for this extended meaning. Prt in this context is associated either separately or conjunctively with these determi? natives: (1) &lt;*=* "phallus with liquid issuing from it" (Gardiner 1957: 456, D53) and (2) 0 "grain of sand." The Merenptah Stela Within the immediate context of the text ysrylr/lfkt bnprt.fulsmQl is laid waste, his seed is not," I have noted that the scribe emphasized Israel's devastation by using two clauses. Rainey writes regarding the first clause, "the yerbfkt is not associated with the destruction of agricultural products; it is used in various contexts to signify complete destruction or ruin" (2001: 64). This as- sertion disregards the lexicography that I have</page><page sequence="30">MERENPTAH'S inscription and reliefs and the origin OF ISRAEL 21 outlined (Hasel 1998a: 76-78; 1998b: 64). In fact this intransitive verb is defined as "wiist sein, brach liegen (vomLand 14, vomAcker 15; Wb, 1,579)." The Worterbuch enumerates fourteen instances where fkt is tied directly to the laying waste ofthe land and fifteen occurrences linked to the destruc? tion of harvest. Although it only occurs once in the context of Merenptah's stela, it is employed six times during Ramesses III's reign where fkt is significantly associated with n prt three times. It is precisely this close association ofthe werb fkt with the clause bn prt.f that further substantiates an agricultural interpretation. I fully agree with Rainey that "if we follow the rules of Late Egyp? tian, bn introduces an independent clause; in this case it would be a parallel statement to the previ? ous clause" (2001: 64). I continue to maintain with Spiegelberg that "The two phrases, 'Israel is laid waste (fkftj), its grain (prt) is not,' are describing similar events, the second clause in epexegetical relationship to the first" (Hasel 1998a: 76; cf. Spiegelberg 1896: 23-24). Indeed, from the im- mediate context there is no reason to deny that the scribe is portraying the desolation of Israel's grain by communicating that the land or harvest?the food supply and subsistence of the socio-ethnic group Israel?is laid waste. Before moving away from the context of the Merenptah stela, let us turn to the Libyan cam? paign that is the primary focus ofthe inscription. Line 7 states, "The loaves (//= "grain or barley") for his provision were seized; he had no water in his waterskin to keep him alive" {KRI IV: 14,12; Wilson 1969: 377; cf. "grain" in Breasted 1906: vol. 3: 260 ?610). This is a straightforward refer? ence to the confiscation of the enemy's life sup? port system by the Egyptians. In the same line, "Their tents were burnt up, made ashes. All his goods {hi) were food {wnmw) for the troops" {KRI IV: 14,14-16; Wilson 1969: 377).2 Merenptah's intent was not only to burn the camps ofthe Liby- ans, but to confiscate their goods as food for his army (Hasel 1994: 53). Moreover, the concluding lines just prior to the hymnic-poetic unit state: "He who plows his harvest {smw) will eat it" {KRI IV: 18,15; Wilson 1969: 378). This phrase is in the setting ofa longer description ofthe land at peace. It would imply that in time of war the conqueror will not allow the enemy to eat the harvest?and by implication his grain?because he will have destroyed or confiscated it for his own use. Thus the stela contains three direct and indirect refer? ences to the destruction of enemy agricultural re? sources. Contextual Perspectives Moving to other Egyptian contexts, the de? struction or confiscation of produce and orchards is attested as early as the 6th Dynasty (Autobiogra- phy of Weni): "This army returned in safety, it had cut down its figs, its vines" {Urk I: 103,13-14; Lichtheim 1973: 20). The records of Tuthmosis III's campaigns to Canaan indicate the repeated destruction of "grain or barley" (//), "trees" {htf mnw) which are "destroyed" {sk), "cut down" {s cd) , and "felled" (whi\ Hasel 1998a: 75-76; 1998b: 61). The annals also recall "a list ofthe harvest which was taken away for his majesty from the fields of Megiddo: 207,300 [+ x] sacks of wheat, apart from the gleanings taken from the army of his majesty. [...]" {UrkIV: 667; Hoffmeier 2000a: 13). This is a direct reference to the action taken by the crown to harvest grain and demonstrates that the army also confiscated agricultural produce for its purposes (see comments by Goedicke 2000: 108-10). During a campaign against Naharin re? corded in the Gebel Barkal stela, the king claims, "From it I took grain and plucked their barley. I cut down all their orchards and all their fruit trees. Their territory has been cut off, my majesty de- molished it, it having turned into [...] on which there are no trees" (Helck 1955: 1227-43; Hoffmeier 2000b: 15). In his article, Rainey (2001: 62-63) contends that the term //means barley and not grain. But the exclusive definition of "barley" advocated by Rainey is not supported by the best sources available. Other defmitions include "corn in general" (Faulkner 1962: 32); and "barley, corn" (Gardiner 1957: 517, U10). For a Britisher "corn" means "grain" as Gardiner clarifies when he states that ^m is the determinative for grain (1957: 516, U9). Does the employment ofa more specific term for grain negate the point that the Egyptians in the 18th Dynasty routinely destroyed enemy crops? In fact Tuthmosis III does use the term prt. "Now</page><page sequence="31">22 MICHAELG. HASEL [his majesty] found [the] entire [land of] Djahi, with orchards filled with their fruit (prt)" (Urk IV: 687,9-10; Wilson 1969:239). Here prt obviously refers to the fruit ofthe orchards and appears with the expected determinatives ^ and ^. Unfortu? nately, Rainey misses the whole point of referenc- ing these earlier sources, namely to establish that there was an Egyptian military precedent to de- stroying or confiscating the agricultural produce ofthe enemy. When we come to the 19th and 20th Dynasties, the language and form of describing military ac? tivity against the agricultural hinterland becomes increasingly rhetorical and abstract with the rep- etition of stereotypical phraseology (Hasel 1998b: 62). This is especially to be anticipated in the bom- bastic style found in Ramesses III's monumental inscriptions (Cifola 1991: 27; cf. Grimal 1986). Here the legitimization ofthe king is central: it is the king who must restore mfc t, "truth, justice, and order" (on the concept of kingship and legiti- mation, see Otto 1969; Baines 1995; on mf t: Volten 1963; Jankuhn 1963; Hornung 1992: 131? 45; Assman 1990, 1994; cf. Hasel 1998a: 19-20). It is true that the intent ofthe scribe in these texts becomes increasingly illusive. But before we as- sume that the language refers to progeny or hu? man seed we should reexamine each case. I will follow Rainey's sequence beginning with the Sea Peoples: As for those who reached my frontier, their seed is not, their heart and their soul are fin? ished forever and ever. As for those who came forward together on the seas, the full flame was in front of them at the Nile mouths, while a stockade of lances surrounded them on the shore, prostrated on the beach, slain, and made into heaps from head to tail. Their ships and their goods (ht) were as if fallen into the wa? ter (KRI V: 40,15-41,1; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 55-56). Rainey (2001: 57-58) concludes that Ramesses III could not have destroyed the grain ofthe Sea Peoples for the enemy was not attacked in the open field but in ships. It is true that the agricultural fields of the enemy are not the issue here, and therefore, it is no surprise that the Egyp- tians, in this context, do not use the vQvbfkt, "to lay waste [fields and harvest]." However, prt here does not mean human beings. For one thmgprt is unequivocally written with the ^ and^. determinatives. The phrase nn prt.sn deals with the life-subsistence supplies of the Sea Peoples not their fields. Certainly these seafarers would have carried with them food for their journey just as the Libyans did during Merenptah's campaign. According to the text, both their ships and their goods {hi) had fallen into the water. The term ht'vs the same word used in the Merenptah stela to re? fer to the goods ofthe Libyans which became "food for the troops." It is in this sense that the Sea Peoples' "heart and soul were finished forever and ever." Their life subsistence sources were gone and their mode of transportation destroyed. The Egyp? tians could rightly boast, "their grain is not." In the Amurru example, which Rainey cor- rectly points out is not chronologically fixed to the Libyan campaign, we are most certainly deal? ing with the destruction of grain: While the one of Amor is ashes; his seed is not; all his people are taken captive, scattered, laid low; every survivor in his land comes with praise, to see the great son of Egypt over them (KRIV: 21,13-15; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 22). It seems inconsistent to maintain that nnprt.f here means progeny or human beings when the enemy people under attack not only survive but are all taken captive and are found praising the king of Egypt! Although they are now in a foreign land, still, their life and progeny will continue. Grain is the only meaning that makes sense in this context. Significantly, only a few lines later those same captives proclaim thankfully: "Our land {tf) is destroyed (Jkw), but we are in a land {tf) of life with the darkness dispelled!" They are in a land of life because "satisfaction, food and sup? plies abound in the Two Lands" {KRIV: 22,1-2; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 23). Again food and supplies are linked together. The obvious impli- cation is that in the land of their origin food was not plentiful, but it is in Egypt. The verb ?kw can also mean "to perish" (Faulkner 1962: 6; Lesko 1982: 11). This is an appropriate antonym to "the</page><page sequence="32">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 23 land of life." The land has perished because the very source of life was removed, the agricultural produce controlled by the chief of Amor (Amurru) was either confiscated or destroyed?"his grain was not." In the third example the Libyan enemy speaks of its defeat against the Egyptian forces: "There attacks us the ilre of our own desire, and we are desolate (fkw)\ Our heat is taken away, our strength is not... foolish were the hurlings of ourselves toward death and mak? ing the fire which we (ourselves) entered! Our seed (prt) is not" (KRIW: 24,10-14; Edgerton andWilsonl936:29). Fire is often used as a metaphor for the furi- ous intensity of the battle or for the power of the king (Hasel 1998a: 85; cf. the Battle of Kadesh, KRI II: 51,15). The "fire of our own desire" is ac? tually the battle that the Libyans themselves ini- tiate as they approach Egypt. Because of their at? tack and their subsequent defeat they have been desolated or laid waste (fkw). This is the same ag? ricultural term that refers so often to the laying waste of fields and harvest. One could conclude that because their provisions were confiscated so too has their ability to fight, expressed here as heat (hh). The Libyans, who indeed may have been seeking grain from Egypt, realize that their attack has caused their demise and the few provisions they did have are now gone causing them to ex- claim?"our grain is not." The fourth example, occurs as Ramesses III stands before Amun and Mut: I have east down the violators of my frontier, prostrate in their places their runners, pinioned and slain in my grasp. I have overthrown the land of Temeh; their seed (prftj) is not (KRI V: 20,1-3; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 18). Here specific mention is made ofthe land (fj) of Temeh. Earlier, as Ramesses III set out on this campaign his purpose was "to destroy (sksk) the land of Temeh which has transgressed his fron? tier" (KRIV: 12,6; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 8). Now the outcome of his campaign is reported in detail. Temeh in this latter instance has the determinatives jM and ^ indicating that the mili- tary activity applies both to the people and the re? gion or nation. The people and land are destroyed in the sense that "their seed is not." The termprft], written in this case without the /, is written again unequivocally with the ^ and ^ determinatives. Even if one ignored these determinatives, the meaning human beings or progeny would be diffi? cult to maintain. Only a few lines later we find the boast, "He has taken captive the violators of his frontier" {KRIV: 20,9-10; Edgerton and Wilson 1936:19). In the reliefs Ramesses III is shown ac- companied by soldiers and officials as he drives the Libyan captives before his chariots. Libyan survivors in this scene are represented bound be? low his chariot. How then could progeny be meant? Apparently the reference to overthrowing of the land of Temeh included the destruction or confis- cation of that land's agricultural produce or sup? plies that were brought to support the attack against Egypt. One of the strongest cases for the reading of "grain" comes from the Year 11 inscription ofthe Second Libyan War. The context does not describe the tactics of the Egyptians, but rather the result of the Meshwesh who attack the towns and land ofthe Tehenu on their way to Egypt: The Meshwesh (chief) previously, before he was seen, was coming, having moved away all together, his land with him, having fallen upon the Tehenu, who were made ashes, devas- tated (/?) and desolated (fkw) were their towns; their seed (prt) is not (KRIV: 60,6-8; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 76) The language here is one of complete destruc? tion. First, the people (fA) of Tehenu are made ashes, a metaphor that in this context may have been literal (on this metaphor, see now Goedicke 2001). The two terms used to describe the mili? tary activity against the towns of the Tehenu in? clude bothy% dxAfkw. Fh most often means "etw. zerstoren, zu Grunde richten; zu Grunde gehen 11. Auch von verfallenden Mauern 12" (Wb, I, 578). Other meanings include, "to destroy, obliterate" (Faulkner 1962:98) or "to slay, to destroy, to deso- late, to dismantle, to devastate, to ruin, to crumple,</page><page sequence="33">24 MICHAELG. HASEL to break into, to annihilate" (Lesko 1982-90:191). The burning or razing of towns may have been a practice of the Meshwesh, who would not have wanted any force to deter their attack against Egypt. Again the verb just preceding prt is fkw which refers to the laying waste of fields and har? vest. This verb suggests that the attack extended also to the agricultural hinterland of these towns. Prt again appears with the ^ and 0 followed by 8oi, indicating the plural. The Egyptians describe the destruction of the Tehenu by the Meshwesh who burn, destroy, and perhaps raze their towns while also systematically destroying or confiscat- ing their grain?a commodity that would certainly have been necessary for their own life subsistence as they prepared to attack Egypt and make a home for themselves there. Rainey's final example seems to be the stron- gest argument in favor of reading prt as progeny or human beings. However, due caution must be exercised in light ofthe previous contexts: The land of Meshwesh was devastated (fR) all at once, the Rebu and Seped were de? stroyed (sksk), so that their seed (prt) was not. [Their] mothers and their concubines hang in suspense in their midst, so that their children do not come into being.... (KRIV: 65,7-9; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 84-85). The context is that the Meshwesh who aligned themselves with the Rebu and Seped have been defeated by the king of Egypt. Rainey has a valid point when he includes the next line ofthe inscrip? tion "[their] mothers and their concubines hang in suspense in their midst, so that their children do not come into being." Two possibilities exist. Ei? ther the seed ofthe Meshwesh, Rebu, and Seped refer to human seed, and by extension their chil? dren (Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 84 n. 49a) or we are dealing with two separate ideas and clauses. Equally plausible is the explanation that the phrase nn prt.sn is directly referring to and explaining the destruction or confiscation of the life subsis? tence sources ofthe Meshwesh, Rebu and Seped. The phrase concerning mothers and concubines occurs in the next physical line ofthe inscription. While the Egyptian scribe may have simply run out of space, he also may have chosen to indicate a clear separation. Still, if the Egyptians had meant progeny or human seed, they would have used the r=^ instead ofthe ^ determinative. The Determinatives Rainey does not adequately explain one ofthe most persuasive reasons for interpreting prt in these contexts as grain, namely the nearly consis? tent use ofthe determinative ^ for prt. Rainey asserts, "The imagery involves the comparison of humans with plants: like plants, people have roots and procreate by means of their seed. This botani? cal similitude may explain why in none ofthe in- stances of prt in these contexts does the word have the ^ determinative usually employed when seed is intended" (2001: 65). Again "The word prt is used as an agricultural simile, but in the sense of destroying human beings, not grain" (2001: 61). In other words, Rainey admits that the Egyptians literally meant prt to be understood in an agricul? tural sense because ofthe ^#, yet he believes that the metaphorical meaning human seed or progeny was intended. I concur with Rainey that we are dealing here with abstract language. But since the literal mean? ing is in fact agricultural?grain or fruit?the im- plied metaphor for seed is the subsistence sources of the enemy. This is only logical. If the Egyp? tians, who were so consistent in their use of determinatives (Hasel 2000,2003a), intended the reader to understand prt literally as human seed, they surely would have used the ^ determina? tive. The context of two closely associated usages of prt demonstrates this. In Ramesses IIFs Inscrip? tion of Year 11 Amun-Re is described as the cre- ator ofthe king, "He [Amun Re] chose a lord, one whom he had created, the seed {prt) which issued from his body, a divine youth, a noble lad, great of strength, mighty of arm, the effective plan- maker..." {KRIV: 59,6-7, 9; Edgerton and Wil? son 1936: 75). This obvious use of prt as human seed/progeny is accompanied with the r=*9 as one would expect. The scribe is identifying Ramesses III as the direct physical descendant of Amun-Re. This is not metaphorical. This usage of prt clearly means human seed/sperm (see also Edgerton and</page><page sequence="34">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 25 Wilson 1936:113). Significantly, only eleven lines later, comes the statement, "The Meshwesh ... having fallen upon the Tehenu, who were made ashes. Devastated and desolated were their towns; non-existent was their seed (prt)" (KRIW: 60,7-8; Edgerton and Wilson 1936: 76). Here prt is writ? ten with the ^! The orthographic and contextual evidence indicates that the meaning for nn prt.f/ sn is literally grain and is understood as a meta- phor for the life ofthe enemy since their life-sub- sistence source has been eradicated. The immedi- ate and broader contextual references coupled with the consistent use of determinatives indicate that the Egyptians knew what they were saying as they strictly followed the conventions of their language system.3 THE DESTRUCTION OF "GRAIN" AND COMPARATIVE MATERIAL Through a comparative approach with Near Eastern and biblical sources, Rainey focuses on the use of seed as a metaphor for progeny or hu? man seed, for which there is ample evidence, as the Egyptian examples using the f=* determina- tive also demonstrate. But most of his choices are not contemporaneous with the Egyptian New Kingdom, nor do they appear in the same genre of literature4. The more pertinent question that re? mains unanswered is this: Was the destruction of life support systems a common practice in con? temporary military accounts of the ancient Near East? I have selected a few illustrative examples from a new, extensive study ofthe military tactics during the second and first millennia b.c.e. (Hasel in press). Amarna Letters Rainey, a leading authority on the Amarna let? ters, is certainly aware that the destruction or con- fiscation of grain was a repeated problem. cAbdi- Asratu claims to be "the one who guards the har? vest ofthe grain of Sumer and all the lands for the king" (EA 60; Moran 1992: 132). Indeed, he not only guards the grain of Sumer but desires the grain of other cities as well. Rib-Hadda complains: "he has attacked me three times this year, and for two years I have been repeatedly robbed of my grain, we have no grain to eat" (EA 85; Moran 1992: 156). Although Yanhamu apparently claimed to the Egyptians that he gave Rib-Hadda grain, Rib-Hadda denies it (EA 85, lines 41-50; Moran 1992: 156). In EA 86 Rib-Hadda makes another request for grain, indicating that his city has sufferedgreatly (Moran 1992: 158).InEA125 he states again, "But now Aziru has repeatedly raided me. I have neither sheep nor goats. Aziru has taken everything. And there is no grain for my food, and the peasantry has gone off to towns where there is grain for their food" (Moran 1992: 204). Again, "there is no grain (or) food [for] the archers to eat" (EA 131; Moran 1992: 213). In EA 90 and 91 Rib-Hadda says, "I have been plun? dered of [my grain] it is [to you] that I have tur[ned]" (Moran 1992: 164-65). Again cAbdi- Asirta is accused of seizing "all the lands of the king" (EA 126; Moran 1992: 206). He is not the only one who used this tactic. The cApiru also are said to have "plundered all the lands ofthe king" (EA 286; Moran 1992: 327) andLabcayu likewise had a reputation of cultivating the king's fields if Moran is correct in his reconstruction of the text (EA250; 1992: 303-4). Hittite Sources In a recent study, S. Hutter-Braunsar (1989) addresses the destruction of grain as a Hittite mili? tary tactic. In the apology of Hattusili III, the ad- jective dannatta- "leer, ode, wiist" is employed for the destruction of the hinterland. The verb dannattahh- "leeren, verwiisten," from which it derives, is found only in the annals of Mursili II (Hutter-Braunsar 1989: 61). In the Anitta Text (Neu 1974) the verb anniya- is employed to de? scribe the destruction of Ulma (Hutter-Braunsar 1989: 216 n. 33). Weeds are planted with the as- sumed intention being to keep the fields from pro- ducing necessary edible vegetation?a deliberate act used to destroy the agricultural land of the enemy. This type of vindictive destruction ofthe life support system is also found in the "Ten Year An? nals" of Mursili II: "I gave him the following or- ders: 'Since the men of Nuhasse are hostile, go</page><page sequence="35">26 MICHAELG. HASEL and destroy their harvest and besiege them.' Kurunta went leading the troops and horse-troops. He destroyed the harvest ofthe land of Nuhasse and besieged them." The annals confirm the ac- tion, "The troops whom Kurunta had led for de- stroying the harvest of Nuhasse brought Niqmadda before me because he had killed his father Aitakkama, king of Kinza" (Beal 2000: 89). Assyrian Sources The Assyrians describe in vivid detail their confiscation and destruction of trees, fruit trees, grain, and other life subsistence sources of the enemy (Bleibtreu 1989; Cole 1997). The only sec? ond millennium military reference comes from the Middle Assyrian ruler Tiglath-Pileser I, who dur? ing his campaign against Suhi claims, "Their or? chards I cut down" (ARAB 1:99 ?310). In the same text: "How many of their lofty cities he smashes! (From) their [fi]elds of sustenance he rips out the grain. He cuts down their fruit; the orchard he destroys. [0]ver their mountains he makes the Deluge pass" (LKA 63 r. 14-18; see Hurowitz and Westenholz 1990:4). This practice continued well into the first millennium. Assurnasirpal II destroys the cities of Lake and Suhi and says, "I reaped their harvest" (RIMA 2:214, iii 32; ARAB 1, 161 ?472). Later he asserts, "I reaped the barley and straw of the land of Luhutu (and) stored (it) in? side" (RIMA 2, 218, iii 82). On the Kurkh mono- lith Assurnasirpal says, "I reaped the harvest of the land(s) Nairi (and) stored (it) for the suste? nance of my land in the cities of Tusha, Damdammusa, Sinabu, (and) Tidu" (RIMA 2,261- 62, 96-97; ARAB 1, 182 ?502; cf. Cifola 1997/ 98: 156-58). This same claim is repeated on the Nimrud monolith (RIMA 2, 251, iv 107-8). Shalmaneser III (858-824 b.ce.) states in year 3, "Ahuni, son of Adini... I shut up in his city, car? ried off the grain (lit. crops) of his (fields), cut down his orchards" (ARAB 1, 229 ?620). In his eighth year in battles against the rebels in Babylonia, he claims to have defeated the king Marduk-bel-usate. "I shut him up in his city, I car? ried off the grain of his fields, I cut down his or? chards, I turned aside (lit. dammed) his river" (ARAB 1, 230 ?622). Thus the destruction of or- chards and the confiscation of grain began in Assyria as early as the twelfth century (Tiglath- Pileser I) and was predominant by the ninth cen? tury b.ce. In only two texts is grain used for feed- ing ofthe Assyrian army. In most cases there is a blatant destruction of the life support system as recompense for a rebellious enemy?one whose city was defeated or who withstood the siege. This tactic also occurs in texts of the eighth and sev? enth centuries. Sargon II boasts in a letter to Assur, "their crops (and) their stubble I burned, their filled up granaries I opened and let my army devour the unmeasured grain. Like swarming locusts I turned the beasts of my camps into its meadows, and they tore up the vegetation on which it (the city) de? pended, they devastated its plain...." {ARAB 2, 86 ?159). "Their bounteous crops I burned up, [their filled up granaries I opened] and let my army devour the unmeasured grain" {ARAB 2,87 ? 161). This theme is repeated again and with more detail: Into his pleasant gardens, which adomed his city (lit. the adornments of his city) [and] which were overflowing with fruit and wine, like the immeasurable (?) downpour of heaven, my fierce warriors rushed like Adad (the storm- god), they made the noise of iron to resound (and) great quantities of its fruit, which could not be measured, came tumbling down. No quaking heart escaped from (that) fight, (their) etemal desire (they realized). His great trees, the adomment of his palace, I cut down like millet (?), and I destroyed the city of his glory, and his province I brought to shame. The trunks of all those trees which I had cut down I gathered together, heaped them in a pile and burned them with fire. Their abundant crops, which (in) garden and marsh (?) were immea? surable, I tore up by the root and did not leave an ear (by which) to remember the destruc? tion (ARAB 2, 88-89 ?161). Thus Amarna, Hatti, and Assyria corroborate the Egyptian sources, attesting to the widespread, second and first millennium tactic of confiscating and destroying agricultural produce, including trees, orchards, and grain.5 Having dealt with the relevant Egyptian and contemporary ancient Near Eastern texts, it is imperative to turn now to the iconographic evidence brought into the discussion by Rainey.</page><page sequence="36">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 27 - Binding of enemies i- Lands/Nations Region City-states/ People Region Lands/Nations L Binding of enemies r- A The princes are prostrate, saying 'Peace!"

MERENPTAH'S CAMPAIGN AND THE KARNAK RELIEFS The reliefs on Karnak's "Cour de la Cachette," dated by F. Yurco to Merenptah, increase the prob- ability that Merenptah's forces campaigned in Canaan (fig. 2; Yurco 1986,1990,1997). The ques? tion of whether Merenptah actually led the cam? paign himself due to his advanced age is super- fluous (questioned most recently by Redford 1992: 275 n. 85; Higginbotham 2000: 47). The facts are that the campaign is recorded briefly in the con? clusion of his account against the Libyans (Hoffmeier 2000c: 40-41), and it must have been of some importance, for Merenptah adopts the epithet "conqueror of Gezer" in the Amada stela (KRIW: 1,9; Gauthier 1913; Cerny 1959; Youssef: 1962). The last section of the stela forms a kind of hymnic-poetic structure helping to identify the focus ofthe campaign (Lichtheim 1976: 73). Af? ter surveying and critiquing the various proposals of the past century, I independently developed a new structure based on the "parallelism of politi? cal and geographical sequences and terms which most accurately maintains the integrity ofthe text" (fig. 1; Hasel 1994: 50-51,48, fig. 1). Recently, I have dealt in detail with the new grammatical structure proposed by Hoffmeier, which, I believe, while advancing the discussion considerably, in- troduces grammatical nuances that enhance rather than contradict the structure I proposed in 1994 (Hasel 1998a: 68-71; 2003b). My sequence, largely supported by Rainey, Yurco, and Kitchen, makes it certain that Israel was located in Canaan, that is, within the region of Canaan/////*^, the two synonymous terms used to describe that territory of Egypt's western frontier.6 Once having established the territory of Caman/ffJrw, there is a clear progression from the lands on the extremities of Egypt's territories, namely Tehenu (Libya) and Hatti, to those within the land of Canaan. The plunder of Canaan is de? tailed in the actions taken against the three city- states of Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yenocam and the socio-ethnic entity Israel. All entities have the c^ determinative while Israel alone is accompanied with the M sign. Without a doubt, the distinctive determinative for Israel designates it as a socio- ethnic people, although these determinatives do not indicate Israel's social structureperse (Rainey 1992: 74; Kitchen 1997: 74-75; cf. Hasel 1998a: 199 n. 2). Moving now to the Karnak reliefs, Rainey once again readdresses his challenge to Yurco's identification of Scene 4 with Israel (see Rainey</page><page sequence="37">28 MICHAELG. HASEL 1 .Scene3 ? ? | Yenoam ? Israel ? !&gt;* Scene 6 Scene 9 Gezer? Hittite Treaty Ashkelon %ir Shasu v?&gt; Y^&gt;M mm.^.

Hasel; Drawings courtesy ofFrank Yurco and Susanna Heinz.) 1991, 1992, 1999, 2000, 2001: 68-74). Rainey's objections stem largely from his adherence to the "peaceful infiltration" model advocated by A. Alt, M. Noth, and Y Aharoni (Rainey 2001: 66-68). According to Rainey and other proponents of this model, the enigma surrounding Israel's origin is resolved by Egyptian references to the // Slsw, "land of Shasu," an Egyptian geographical desig? nation with pastoral nomadic inhabitants who hypothetically migrated from Transjordan into the central hill-country (Giveon 1971; Weippert 1974, 1979; Redford 1992; but see Ward 1972; Lorton 1971-72). The toponym tlfeswyhw (for context, see Kitchen 1992: 6; Giveon 1964; Herrmann 1967; Edel 1980) has been cited by scholars who see a possible correlation between this population and the divine name YHWH (Gorg 1976; Weinfeld 1987; Mettinger 1990; Hess 1991; Goedicke 1994; Gorg 2000).

(Courtesy ofSusanna Heinz.) origin of YHWH worship to this region, is not conclusive. We cannot say with any certainty whether t? $?sw yhw, which is a toponym, refers to a region, city or mountain (Axelsson 1987: 60). Nevertheless, it remains a key element for those associating the foes of Shasu with Israel (Giveon 1971; Fensham 1964; Weinfeld 1987; de Moor 1990; but see de Vaux 1969). Rainey now sub- mits that the illusive link between Israel and Shasu is supported by the Merenptah stela and reliefs. However attractive such a correlation may be, I would submit that the Egyptian reliefs need to be evaluated independently and objectively on the basis ofa much broader contextual perspective of Egyptian convention in narrative art and iconog? raphy, an endeavor that is now greatly enhanced by the works of S. C. Heinz (2001) and M. Mtiller (2001). Both Rainey and Yurco agree that Ashkelon is depicted in Scene 1 (fig. 2; Wreszinski 1935: Taf. 58, 58a; Yurco 1986: 208). But Rainey believes that the order ofthe reliefs begins with the scene immediately above Ashkelon (fig. 2; Scene 4). Due to the appearance of the enemy and the presence ofa chariot, Rainey identifies this scene as Canaan and submits that Scene 5-8 depicts Israel/Shasu as prisoners being bound (fig. 3; Rainey 1991, 2001: 73-74). There are six major problems with this interpretation. Geographical Location In the stela, Israel is identified as a socio-eth- nic entity within Canaan///Xw (fig. 1). From the order of toponyms, it is difficult to be more pre- cise, although most scholars, basing themselves on information from the Hebrew Bible, have placed Israel in the central hill-country. While the foes of Shasu are found in various locations in Canaan and even at the battle of Kadesh, I would concur with W. A. Ward, and others that "the land of Shasu, from whence the Shasu came was in Transjordan" (1992: 1166) as it is associated with Seir and significantly Edom during the reign of Merenptah (Papyrus Anastasi VI; Giveon 1971: 131-34).7 Thus there is a fundamental distinction in the locations ofthe land of Shasu and the socio- ethnic people Israel. The Nature of Canaan Rainey (1992: 74; 2001: 63) affirms that both Canaan and Hirw on the stela synonymously form an inclusio designating the territory occupied by</page><page sequence="39">30 MICHAEL G. HASEL 1 ,* --' p^iv^x^Vi'iVrjfifj x. ^^"^^r^l^,..., ' / / / ?&lt;/ // ,_-&gt;;-, IgZSs't a^kJi^?tilL Fig. 4 Superimposed horses and chariot at Karnak. (Drawing by Giselle S. Hasel.) Egypt. The stela describes precisely how Canaan is plundered and Hirw is made a widow?by at- tacks against the three city-states and the socio- ethnic entity Israel within the inclusio (fig. 2; Hasel 1998a: 257-60; Kitchen 1997:74). It would be redundant to attribute a scene on the reliefs to the region Canaan/Z^/*^! If Canaan is a region with the c sign, then why are only a people shown in the Scene 4? Rainey suggests that the city pl Knc nl would have appeared as a fortress on the missing blocks, even though Yurco had in- sisted that the span ofthe king's horses would not have allowed for this possibility (1986: 90). Yet if we superimpose Merenptah's horse from the Ashkelon scene, we find that there is ample room for something else to have been depicted (fig. 4; see now also King and Stager 2001:270, ill. 142a, even though the scale is incorrect). But there is still a problem. A fortress contradicts his earlier statements insisting that Canaan is a "geographi? cal entity,"8 and it begs the question, why would the scribes describe a territory in one place?en- compassing Ashkelon, Gezer, Yenocam and Is? rael?and the artists depict that territory as a mere fortified town in a parallel account? Indeed, with? out the missing blocks, this argument is hypotheti- cal, but while we explore the realm of possibili- ties it could be equally plausible that a descrip? tion ofthe battle mentioning Israel with the people determinative would have appeared on the miss? ing blocks above. Sequence If Scene 4 (fig. 2) is to be identified with Canaan there would be a major break in the narra? tive sequence ofthe reliefs. Rainey posits that the sequence would begin with the king's attack against the city of Canaan {sic = Gaza), to be fol? lowed by the city-states (fig. 5). After Yenocam the eye would then necessarily have to jump back over the scene of Canaan before arriving at the scene depicting Shasu captives being bound (fig. 5; Scene 5) and later being carried off into Egypt (fig. 5; Scene 5, 7) . This is not only unconven- tional for Egyptian narrative art (Gaballa 1976: 100-106), Heinz (2001: 51) has shown in her de? tailed study of New Kingdom battle reliefs that</page><page sequence="40">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 31 Gezer ?

Scene 5 depicts the captives being bound while scenes 6-9 show those captives being led back to Egypt where they are then presented to the Theban Triad. This is the uniform progression of Egyptian art and conforms precisely to the se? quence on the Merenptah stela where the conclud- ing line states: "Everyone who was restless has been bound." Moreover, Rainey's sequence does not follow the poetic structure ofthe stela that is the beginning point of this correlation. The eye would go over Canaan twice before ever arriving to Shasu/Israel.

Israel in</page><page sequence="41">32 MICHAELG. HASEL Scene 4 is without a city-state support system as its determinative on the stela suggests. Is it coin- cidence that the stela mentions only three city- states that are attacked by Egypt, followed by an attack against a socio-ethnic group without a city- state support system and we find the same pattern on the reliefs? In fact, the scribes ofthe stela place more emphasis on the activity against Israel than on any other entity with two phrases: "Israel is laid waste, his grain is not." Yet no such conflict is depicted in Scenes 5-8. In Scene 5 the foes of Shasu are shown bound as captives. If the Shasu were Israel, the claim on the stela would make little sense. How is Israel laid waste (fkift How is its seed not (bnprt.f)! By being taken into cap- tivity? If this were so, we would expect a verb like "captured," (hik) "seized" (mh), or "plun- dered," (hf).Hf'\? precisely the terminology used for "those of Shasu," but never employed for Is? rael.9 The distinction in content and terminology is clear. Names Israel is not called Shasu in the stela and the inhabitants of Shasu are not called Israel in the reliefs. The captives in Scenes 5, 7-8 have this inscription, n? nSlsw h3fhm.f "consisting ofthe Shasu plundered by his majesty" (Yurco 1986: 195, fig. 9; 207; Giveon 1971: 93). In this case, one could also read /?///asa possessive article, "among those (people) oi S?sw plundered by his majesty" (Erman 1933: 181). In other words, it is the enemies of the "land of Shasu" and the city- states of Canaan (Scenes 6 and 8) that are being carried off. Israel may not even need to appear in these scenes, for the action against Israel does not focus on taking prisoners. According to the stela, it revolves around the destruction or confiscation of Israel's source of subsistence?its grain. Determinatives The determinative used for Israel in the stela is that for a people: fA. By identifying Israel with the foes of fesw, Rainey has maintained that Is? rael was a tribal entity. He supports this conclu? sion by appealing to the determinative f^? which, he asserts "is by far the most common determina? tive for Shosu" (Rainey 1991: 74). But this is cer? tainly not the case. Historically, 8?sw is most de- monstrably accompanied with the c-j determina? tive (Table 1). The entity $?sw occurs merely four times with the seated man determinative, three times in Papyrus Anastasi I and only once in Pa? pyrus Anastasi VI (three times also with the c j; Giveon 1971: 125-33; Doc. 36, 37). In the six determined occurrences from Tuthmosis II to Seti I the toponym Sisw is accompanied consistently by the [ ^, which would designate it as a geographi? cal territory (Hasel 1998a: 220-21). The preposi- tions hr, "from" and n, "of' preceding the subject Sisw indicates that the writer is was referring to the place of origin for the captives or rebels en? countered by the Egyptians. The use ofthe l also occurs in most of the texts from the reign of Ramesses II (Hasel 1998a: 221-24).10 The excep? tions are obvious. In the battle of Kadesh the two Shasu spies appear in all versions with the h "en? emy, captive" determinative {KRIll: 103,12-16; Hasel 1998a: 222-23). Here the scribe delineates the nature ofthe two men from the "tribe of S?sW by his choice of determinative?they are enemies or captives of Egypt (Hasel 2003a). The geographi? cal nature of this entity is confirmed by the fre? quent designation // Sisw, "the land of Shasu" (Hasel 1998a: 223). In fact, of at least thirty oc? currences of Sisw in monumental inscriptions, excluding the Kadesh accounts, ninety-three per? cent of them refer to it by the r, i or by ti, "land." When the Kadesh accounts are included the per? centage is eighty percent and with the papyrus sources indicated above, the percentage remains seventy-six percent. D. Lorton (1971-72:147-50) was correct that Sisw was most frequently desig- nated as a geographical territory. Merenptah's scribes were also consistent at Karnak to write "those of SisW" with the ^ and not the ^A sign. These observations indicate that there are too many difficulties in Rainey's interpretation to be convincing. But if Scene 4 is indeed Israel, as Yurco first proposed, then what is to be done with the chariot and Canaanite attributes? Some have even questioned whether this is indeed an enemy chariot, for the upper portion of the register is missing (Stager 1985: 58*). Only the wheel and</page><page sequence="42">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 33 Table 1. Determinatives associated with the "foes of Shasu.' the lower portion ofthe chariot and its horses are preserved. There is nothing in the design of the chariot itself that would make it inherently Canaanite or Egyptian. Heinz (2001: 52 n. 151; 108, Abs. 142) largely clarifies the issue as she has identified the falling commander behind the chariot who is clearly not an Egyptian (fig. 7). Coupled with the stumbling horses and its loca? tion under the king's span, it is established that this is an enemy chariot (Yurco 1997: 34). Then why would the Israelites have a chariot? Yurco suggests that the they may have captured a chariot from skirmishes with the Canaanites (1997: 34). On the other hand, it might even be a captured chariot from the Egyptians. As J. K. Hoffmeier has observed: In the 19th and 20th Dynasties, the [Egyptian] chariot wheels, for the most part, continue to have six spokes. We see them, for example, on the royal chariots of Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses III. Admittedly, for the reigns of Ramesses II and Ramesses III, one can cite scenes depicting four-spoked wheels, but, in each instance, the chariots are driven by for? eign warriors" (Hoffmeier 1976: 44; cf. Schulman 1957, 1963, 1980).</page><page sequence="43">34 MICHAEL G. HASEL Fig. 7 Scene 4: Enemy fallingfrom chariot beneath the king's horses. (Courtesy ofSusanna Heinz.) Fig. 8 Ramses II: Ramesseum attack against the city ofDapur. (Courtesy ofSusanna Heinz.) Indeed, in the battle against Ashkelon (fig. 2; Scene 1), Merenptah rides on a six-spoked chariot while the fleeing enemy appears on one with four- spokes. In Scene 4 (fig. 2) the chariot in question is six-spoked, which might suggest an Egyptian chariot rather than a Canaanite one (but see also figs. 8-10). It seems unlikely, however, that the Egyptians would depict one of their own captured chariots in a victory scene. Perhaps the Egyptians are simply depicting a scene with stereotypical motifs commonly found in military reliefs during the 19th and 20th Dynasties (Heinz 2001: 102-9; Abs. 126-44; cf. figs. 8-10). This appears closer to the truth. In this case, perhaps too much has been read into the significance ofa chariot. It may simply have been a vehicle, both literally and iconographically, to convey that Egypt's enemy was being laid waste. By questioning the Canaanite appearance of Israel in Scene 4, Rainey reveals his assumption</page><page sequence="44">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 35 J % 'taklrm'r- ^1' Fig. 9 Ramses II: Karnak scene ofdefeated chariot. (Courtesy ofSusanna Heinz.) Fig. 10 Ramses III: Attack against the city ofTunip. (Courtesy ofSusanna Heinz.) that the Egyptians would depict Israel differently than others living within the general region of Canaan/////*^. But this assumption fails to take into account the stereotypical nature of "ethnic" detail in Egyptian narrative art. The Egyptians did make clear distinctions between the conquered enemy and the Egyptian army (Helck 1971: 328- 36; Yurco 1989). The people of Hatti were con- sistently portrayed as clean shaven with foreheads bear and long hair (Wreszinski 1935: Taf. 21,21a, 22,24), while the pastoral nomadic inhabitants of southern Transjordan (t? SJsw) are also distin? guished in appearance (Ward 1972: 45; Giveon 1971). But we do not find artists making distinc? tions in appearance between every ethnic or re? gional group. Among the Sea Peoples, there is no distinction made between the Peleset, Tjekker, and Denyen who all wear feathered headdresses (Dothan 1982: 6; Dothan and Dothan 1992: 18; in general Widmer 1975). In Merenptah's reliefs the inhabitants of Canaan wear headbands around thick hair, cut above the shoulders and have pointed beards. Their dress is made up ofa long skirt and folded sash around the waist. This is the typical portrayal of the Asiatic enemy living in Canaan/f/irw. In a most detailed study of New</page><page sequence="45">36 MICHAELG. HASEL Kingdom reliefs, W. Wreszinski attempted to de? fine distinct ethnic groups, but concludes: "It is a lost effort to construct an ethnography of Syria and Palestine during the New Kingdom based on the Egyptian reliefs" for "here the typical and not the extraordinary was recorded" (my translation; 1935: taf. 1). Thus the reliefs of Ramesses II, Seti I and Merenptah portray the inhabitants of Canaanite cities with little variation (see particu? larly Ashkelon, Qader, and Gezer in the south, and Yenoc am, and the chiefs of Lebanon in the north; Epigraphic Survey 1986: pls. 23, and others; Murnane 1990). There existed a stereotypical and generic motif of an Asiatic or inhabitant of Canam/ffirw with some minor distinctions (see summary details in Wreszinski 1935: taf. 1; Helck 1971: 333-35; for Ramesses II see Wreszinski 1935: taf. 54,57,66,71,76). In one smiting scene illustrative ofthe regional enemy types, Ramesses II holds the ropes tied around three representative enemies: an enemy from Libya, Kush, and Canaan (Bongioanni, Croce, and Accomazzo 2001: 195; JE 46189). Each are depicted in their respective, typical style of dress. This scene symbolically rep? resents the king restoring order, ml 7, as those poli- ties bordering to the west, south, and east are sub- jugated. These examples illustrate that there is little reason to presume that Israel would be de? picted differently from the inhabitants of Ash? kelon, Gezer, and Yenocam. The stela locates Is? rael in Canaan/////*^and Merenptah's artists faith- fully depict them as inhabitants of this geographi? cal milieu. IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Merenptah's inscription and reliefs must be recognized as archaeological sources of the an? cient world containing both iconographic and lit? erary information that should not be dismissed in discussions about the origin of Israel (see Margalith 1990; Thompson 1992: 275-76, 306, 311; 1999; Whitelam 1996, 2000). Rainey is to be commended for seriously considering these sources, even though in the end parts of his analy? sis have not been convincing. Based on the corre- sponding relationship ofthe terms fkt and prt in the phrase "Israel is laid waste, his seed is not," the stela's internal weight of evidence referring directly and indirectly to the destruction of agri? cultural produce and goods of the Libyans, the contextual analysis of nn prt.f/sn in 19th and 20th Dynasty Egyptian military accounts, and the consistent use of the V determinative, the term prt can indeed be interpreted as agricultural pro? duce or subsistence. The comparative analysis of military contexts from Egypt, Canaan, Hatti, and Assyria illustrate the common practice of target- ing agricultural produce in military campaigns of the second and first millennia and increase the probability that this was also the tactic Merenptah used against Israel. The proposed structure based on parallelisms of geographical and political en- tities, terminological parallels, and now also gram- matical considerations indicate a movement from distinct sociopolitical entities in the outer limits of Egyptian control to those within Canaan that are in close proximity to Egypt (Hasel 1994: 50- 51; 1998a: 257-71; 2003b; cf. Kitchen 1997: 74). The structure clearly places Israel within Canaan/ Hirw, indicating its existence within that region as a people and not as a city-state or geographical territory (Hasel 1994: 54). The Karnak reliefs complement the final hymnic-poetic unit to pro? vide a coherent and consistent picture of Israel as a people determined with f?, while providing clear contextual, terminological, orthographic, pictorial, and geographical distinctions from "those of Shasu" determined with c:-;. From the Egyptian artistic perspective, as inhabitants of Canaan, their outward appearance is represented as the stereotypical type of that region. From the preceding analysis it is indeed possible to suggest that Israel in 1211-1209 b.ce. was a settled people, living agriculturally from the land. The archaeo? logical data still being collected from the central hill country indicates dramatic demographic growth with the distribution of hundreds of small villages (Finkelstein 1988; Finkelstein and Magan 1993; Finkelstein and Lederman 1997; Miller 2002) that testify to a strong agrarian presence (Stager 1985; Borowski 1987; Hopkins 1985; King and Stager 2001; Dever 2003). The estab- lishment of continuity in architecture and mate? rial culture between these settlements ofthe Late</page><page sequence="46">MERENPTAH'S INSCRIPTION AND RELIEFS AND THE ORIGIN OF ISRAEL 37 Bronze-Iron Age transition and Iron II will de- mand new and comparative strategies that test modern, anthropological assumptions of ethnicity (as anticipated by Dever 1995, 2001, 2003; and Miller 2002). Until then Merenptah's inscription and reliefs externally ascribe, in the anthropologi? cal sense of emic versus etic (see Jones 1997: 56- 61; Olsen and Kobyliwski 1991: 7), Israel as an identifiable socio-ethnic group in CanaanTHirw powerful enough to be included in the only known campaign of Merenptah into the southern Levant. It is then an ironic twist of events that as residents of Canaan, it is the outstretched arm of Pharaoh that they taste in the punitive campaign of Merenptah. The people of Israel are laid waste, so that their grain is not. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This article is dedicated to my esteemed men- tor and friend William G. Dever who has dedicated his life to advance the appreciation and knowl? edge of all aspects of Israel's history form its ear? liest beginnings. His legacy will live on through his pioneering work in the field, in pen, and through his students to whom he has passed on a passion for making the realia ofthe past relevant in the present. An earlier version of the Karnak relief analysis was presented at the annual meet- ings of the American Schools of Oriental Re- search, Toronto, Nov. 23,2002. The author wishes to thank Frank Yurco and Susanna Constanze Heinz for permission to publish photographs and drawings. Special appreciation to Giselle Sarli Hasel who produced several ofthe drawings and layout for this article. Thanks to Richard Jasnow for his helpful expertise in hieratic. Marla Samaan and two anonymous readers gave helpful edito- rial suggestions that considerably improved ear? lier drafts of this manuscript. I naturally accept responsibility for the content of this article. NOTES 1. Over a decade later Spiegelberg maintains that "fur prt nur die Bedeutung 'Saat, Getreide, Kom, Frucht' nicht Same im Sinne von Nachkommenschaft in Frage kommen kann" (1908: 404 n. 5). He refers to his own earlier article and to Breasted (1897: 66). 2. Note that the same reference to the confiscation of goods for Merenptah's soldiers is also found in the Karnak inscription (KRIYV: 14,15); for general back? ground, see Schulman (1987). 3. One might question whether the hieratic texts, from which many of the monumental inscriptions were copied, show little differentiation in these determinatives, but this is not the case. According to Moller's Hieratische Paldographie (1909), when comparing the plow (1909:44, #468) with the penis (1909: 8, #95) and the penis with liquid issuing forth (1909: 8, #96), immediate differences become ap? parent. The hieratic writing from the plow retains the two short upstrokes projecting from the imple- ment. If these strokes were missing there may be some similarity between a basic penis and a plow, but it should be noted that the basic penis is also written with two downstrokes indicating the testicles. The penis with liquid issuing forth also retains a bold, downward stroke for the issuing liquid. Professor Richard Jasnow doubts that there would be scribal confusion between the plow and the penis with liq- uid issuing forth (personal communication, 2002). 4. Most commentators and exegetes would date the prophetic writings (not military annals or accounts) of Amos, Isaiah, and Malachi to the eighth century b.ce. and later. None of Rainey's examples are from military contexts casting doubts on their validity, and the Egypto-Hittite treaties are a moot point for they are not preserved. If they had been, prt would un? doubtedly have had the ^ determinative. 5. The tactic of destroying and/or confiscating agricul? tural produce by invading armies continued long into the Greco-Roman periods, see Hanson (1998); Foxhall (1993) with references. 6. Rainey's comment, "Contrary to Hasel the pair Canaan/Kharu is not Syria-Palestine," is confusing. Apparently he did not understand my insistence that these are synonymous terms citing: Stolz (1988: 541); Singer (1994: 289); and those Egyptologists who interpret Hirwas Syria: Gardiner (1961:273 n. 2); Stein (1982: 163 n. 4); Fecht (1983: 120); Hornung (1983: 232); or Syria-Palestine: Yurco (1986: 190); see Hasel (1994: 55-56 n. 10; 1998a: 257-60). I stated "It appears that Hirw is a region</page><page sequence="47">38 MICHAELG. HASEL encompassing all Egyptian territory in the southern Levant during the 19th and 20th Dynasties, including Gezer" (Hasel 1998a: 260; see now Kitchen 1997: 74). 7. The land of ?lsw has been located in Syria (Astour 1979, 1996; Gorg 1976, 2000; Ahlstrom 1986: 59- 60; 1993: 277 n. 5); the Negev or Sinai (Gardiner 1920: 100, 104; Mazar 1981: 5-9; Weinfeld 1987); and Palestine (Lorton 1971-72), but the territory generally accepted is southern Transjordan (Giveon 1971; Ward 1972, 1992; Boling 1988: 37; Bartlett 1989: 77; Redford 1992: 272; Kitchen 1992: 27; Hasel 1998a: 227-32). 8. Some believe that pl Kn cnl refers to Gaza (Katzenstein 1982: 111-13; Redford 1992: 197; Hoffmeier 1997: 29; Uehlinger 1988: 6-25). But Yurco (1990: 90) submits that in the 19th Dynasty Gdt'xs written for Gaza, indicating fts&amp;tplKncnlre- ferred to the region Canaan (also affirmed by Na'aman 1994: 404; Kitchen 1997: 74). 9. Rainey's position regarding the translation ofprt is undermined here as well. For if "those of Shasu" are Israel, and Israel's fighting men have been destroyed and their progeny is no more, how is it that these same men are being led off to Egypt as captives? lO.Lorton (1971-72: 149) posits that the Tanite scribal school differed in their writing due to the "stereo- typed nature of those texts [that] suggests a reflec? tion of past accomplishments rather than historical notation immediately after the event." This may ac? count for some ofthe variation found at Tanis. One occurence on a fragment provides very little context (Doc 29). Even the name Siswis spelled Siswithout the w. One is left to wonder whether this indeed re? fers to the Sisw or some other entity. But it must be pointed out that even if this fragment is included, sixty-seven percent of the occurences at Tanis are determined with the - . In these two instances other explanations than scribal ignorance may account for these variations. REFERENCES Ahlstrom, G. W. 1986 Who were the Israelites?

Joffe Analyses of Chalcolithic mortuary remains and other categories of evidence do not reveal significant levels of social differentiation or other behavior indicative of a ranked society. They indicate instead diverse local mortuary behaviors, suggestive of religious beliefs and regional cultures loosely harmonized by a religio-political organization based on shamanistic access to the supernatural. Contrasts with mortuary practices of Early Bronze Age households and urban organization, as well as cross-culturally, are discussed. It is argued here that mortuary evidence sug? gests models for Chalcolithic social organiza? tion that stress the religio-political nature of elites in the largest settlements. These were not "chiefs" whose power stemmed from multileveled control over the economy and warfare, justified by ideological manipulation (Earle 1997; cf. Yoffee 1993; Stein 1998). Instead it is suggested these were "shamans," exiguous and frangible leaders whose power was almost exclusively religious in nature, supplemented by control over specific materials and craft products related to ritual and display (cf. Joffe, Dessel, and Hallote 2001; Gilead 2002). Outside the centers of settlement there was far less hierarchical organization. Religion, includ? ing rituals centered on mortuary behavior, re? mained key to social integration of widely dis- persed agro-pastoral groups. There was little economic power or demo- graphic pressure in Chalcolithic society, but deep traditions of religious power, with roots in the Paleolithic. Mortuary remains are used to support these assertions. The evolutionary implications of this analysis reemphasize "religion" as a power strategy in "middle range" or "intermediate" soci? eties, which contrasts with early "urban" societ? ies based on economic and social power (see gen? erally Feinman and Neitzel 1984). The results heighten the disjunction between the Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age, where very different organizational principles prevailed in both life and death. SITUATINGTHE CHALCOLITHIC A persistent feature of Chalcolithic studies has been to regard the Beersheva-Ghassul sites as epitomizing the culture as a whole. This was in * For Bill, my teacher, colleague and friend. 45</page><page sequence="55">46 ALEXANDER H. JOFFE part an outgrowth of the accidents of discovery. Though Chalcolithic pottery was best described early on by scholars working in the north, such as Engberg and Shipton (1934) at Megiddo, it was the major excavations in the south, Ghassul in the 1920s and 1930s, and then Bir es-Safadi, Tell Abu Matar, and Horvat Beter in the 1950s, that brought the culture into focus (Mallon 1934; Koeppel et al. 1940; Perrot 1955; Dothan 1959). With the spectacular Nahal Mishmar hoard thrown in, the sophistication of the Beersheva-Ghassul culture was confirmed (Bar-Adon 1980). The origins of the Beersheva-Ghassul culture are also persua- sively found in the various local facies ofthe south? ern Pottery Neolithic (Bourke 1997; cf. Gilead 1990). The latter culture then spread over all of the southern Levant during the course ofthe fifth millennium, apparently supplanting or incorporat- ing the local Wadi Raba tradition (see generally Garfinkel 1992; Gopher and Gophna 1993). As many scholars have noted, however, the fifth mil? lennium is still a poorly understood horizon (Genz 1997; Kerner 1997). While an increasing number of sites are known in the Beth Shan and Jordan Valleys, the Coastal Plain, Golan and central hills, these regional varia? tions were often regarded as derivative, in part be? cause they are generally more poorly preserved and contain less elaborate material culture than southern sites (e.g., Zori 1958; Gophna and Zuk 1990; Gilead 1989). Similarly, surveys in north? ern Jordan have revealed large numbers of Chalcolithic sites, but relatively few have been excavated (e.g., Hanbury-Tenison 1987; Palumbo et al. 1990). Surveys have revealed well over seven hundred Chalcolithic sites (figs. 1 and 2; Joffe 1993: 32-35). Archaeological analyses of the Chalcolithic period have also long included mortuary evidence. Numerous burials, especially caves and infant jar burials, were excavated at Ghassul, "Grotto U" at Tell el-Farcah North (de Vaux 1957), and in the coastal plain, most famously at Bnei Braq, Hadera, Azor and Ben Shemen (Sukenik 1937; Ory 1946; Perrot 1961; 1967; Perrot and Ladiray 1980; van den Brink 1998). Classic discussions ofthe Chalcolithic such as those of de Vaux and Perrot made reference to mortuary data (de Vaux 1970; Perrot 1968). Studies of mortuary remains were reinvigorated during the 1980s, when Levy and Alon excavated the Shiqmim cemetery (Levy and Alon 1982,1985). The various grave circles at the Shiqmim cemetery were analyzed in terms of dif- ferential energy expenditure and ascribed social ranking and provided part of the basis for the "chiefdom" model which prevails in Chalcolithic studies (see generally Levy 1995). Recent discoveries have focused attention away from the Beersheva-Ghassul axis, and from the implicit view that large agro-pastoral villages were normative for the Developed Chalcolithic period. The publication of the final results from several decades of research in the Golan (Epstein 1998) has provided a clearer view ofa much less highly integrated village-level society. Little so? cial differentiation is visible in the Golan sites ei? ther architecturally or materially; there are no spe? cialized structures, no social storage, no elaborate mortuary practices beyond, possibly, the associa? tion with dolmens. Furthermore, religious belief and practice, exemplified by the basalt pillar figu? rines (Epstein 1988; Ibrahim andMittmann 1998) appear to have been household affairs. While it has long been routine to cite variability within the southern Levantine Chalcolithic, the Golan sites now demonstrate this in ways that could only be implied from smaller exposures at Jordan Valley sites such as Neve Ur (Perrot et al. 1967), the enig- matic "Middle Chalcolithic" levels at Tell esh- Shuna North (de Contenson 1960,1960/61,1961), or basal levels in large tells. The evidence from the Beth Shan and Central Jordan Valleys indicates these areas were also cen? ters of Chalcolithic settlement, but sites are dis- persed within localized clusters (e.g., Beth Shan, Zori 1962, 1977), small and relatively isolated (e.g., WZ 121, Banning et al. 1998), or with settle? ment spiraling over a long period within a single site (e.g., Abu Hamid; Dollfus and Kafafi 1988, 1993). The large cluster of Chalcolithic sites in the Zarqa area also have these characteristics (e.g., Abu Habil and Umm Hamad, see Leonard 1992; S. W. Helms 1987; cf. Betts 1992). The find of large Chalcolithic mudbrick platforms at Pella, possibly complex social architecture, remain dif? ficult to understand (Bourke 1996; Bourke et al. 1998: 181), but the overall regional picture sug? gests less hierarchical, but longer-lived, settlement</page><page sequence="56">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 47 En Assawir Peqi% ?

The Chalcolithic burial practices of the Central Jordan Valley remain al? most unknown, another possible indication of lesser degrees of social stratification and differ- entiation. The lack of mortuary data from the Chalcolithic should be contrasted with the Early Bronze I, when extensive dolmen fields appear in the Jordan Valley and highlands of Transjordan (e.g., Ala Safat, Damiyah; Stekelis 1961; Yassine 1985).</page><page sequence="57">48 ALEXANDER H. JOFFE Even more dramatic for understanding the Chalcolithic period have been the discovery of a number of burials and associated ritual material in caves in the central hills and Galilee. The Nahal Qana and Peqicin caves (Gopher 1996; Gal et al. 1997) are elaborately equipped, with gold and elec- trum objects and a wide variety of artifacts, in? cluding ossuaries, previously thought regionally specific. The Qula cave, with its unique human figurine (Milevski 2001), and the well-equipped ShVar Ephraim caves (Oren and Scheftelowitz 1998) have provided additional evidence ofthe richness of settlement in the Coastal Plain and adjacent hills. Finally, the "Cave ofthe Warrior," with its spectacularly preserved textiles, is an elite burial of some sort, radiometrically dated to the very end ofthe period (Schick 1998). These sites in particular provide the opportunity to reinvesti- gate the notion of regional and mortuary variabil- ity in the Chalcolithic. TYPES OF CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY SITES A variety of Chalcolithic mortuary practices are known. These include: 1. Infant jar burials below floors 2. Subsurface burials of adults, often in pits 3. Grave circles 4. Cists 5. Tumuli (and dolmens?) 6. Primary inhumations in natural, artificial, or otherwise modified caves 7. Secondary cave inhumations using ossuaries of ceramic and/or stone 8. Charnel houses The Body in Space The immediate mortuary practices of Chalco? lithic populations are adequately documented. These include the primary burial, frequent removal and excarnation of remains, and replacement ofa portion of the remains into a variety of ossuaries or graves. Gnawing on some human bones sug? gests that at least some bodies were exposed to animals, possibly as part of the process of excarnation, and certainly after burial (Le Mort and Rabinovich 1994; Smith and Sabari 1995; Smith and Kolska-Horwitz 1998). Several points regarding excarnation and intramural inhumation should be emphasized. First is the continual in- volvement of the living with the dead. Burial is rarely the final stage; indeed, in later Near East? ern societies the dead were frequently called upon to intercede, from as close as the living room be? low which they were interred. This is another manifestation ofa particularly ancient practice, the domestic presence of the dead, which dates back to the Early Neolithic, if not the Natufian, and finds its highest level of expression in the skull burials of the eighth and seventh millennia across a vast area of Western Asia (Bienert 1991). The presence ofthe dead apparently established an ongoing con? nection between a domestic structure and a social unit, perhaps related to concepts of property and ownership. Interestingly, domestic interment is not evi? dent during the Pottery Neolithic but reappears during the Chalcolithic (Gopher and Orelle 1995). The subfloor jar burials of newborns and infants throughout later prehistory and into the historic periods may be a subset of this tradition, related perhaps to concepts of earth and rebirth. It sug? gests that until the age of perhaps one or two chil? dren were not regarded as full members ofthe fam? ily and community, but somehow creatures on loan, susceptible to recall. But after the Chalcolithic the burial of adults within settlements largely fades out until the second millennium when it reappears, at least in a few sites like Megiddo (Hallote 1995, 2001). That adults were frequently buried in unelaborated pits within Chalcolithic communi- ties, such as at Ghassul, Bir es-Safadi and Neve Noy (Mallon et al. 1934: 48^19, pl. 24-5; Perrot and Ladiray 1980: 124; Eldar and Baumgarten 1985) may be interpreted as either evidence of de- liberately egalitarian or non-diacritic mortuary be- havior, or as evidence of lesser rank individuals. The Chalcolithic practice of exhuming the dead from a grave after an interval (indicated at Shiqmim and Adeimah), and recovering a sample of remains, manually removing the remaining flesh, and replacing a sample ofthe skeleton in a container, is also an echo of much earlier periods.</page><page sequence="58">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 49 7, ^ 0\* j /( Jf^7H,/&gt; \ AJ /SO i 5 Fzg. 2 Map of Chalcolithic settlement sites and clusters. It is tempting to deem it "transitional," a step be? tween the Neolithic in situ burial of key remains, and the fully extramural cemeteries of the Early Bronze Age and later. The shifting of rooms and caves from habitation to mortuary functions, such as at the Beersheva sites and in the Coastal Plain, demonstrates willingness to redefine existing spaces, as well as to create new spatial relation? ships between the dead and relocated living com- munities. In this latter respect the placement of the house-like ossuaries in small, related groups within caves may map out social and spatial rela? tionships onto mortuary space. The charnel house burials at Kissufim may recreate such relation? ships, probably ofa kin group or lineage, within a single structure (Goren and Fabian 2002). The later surrogate houses and town plan of the Bab edh- Dhra' cemetery may also reflect the same desire physically to recreate relationships within and be? tween social units at a much larger scale (cf. Chesson 1999). The intimate involvement ofthe living and the dead in the Chalcolithic should not be understated. While in some ethnographic settings such as Ti- bet the dismemberment ofthe deceased was a task for specialists, in others, such as rural Greece, it was the prerogative ofthe community and family (Singh 1933; Danforth 1982). That Chalcolithic remains were scraped and bones perforated also indicates a frank level of detachment, so to speak, ofthe living from the dead, an emotional sense of distance and acceptance. At an abstract level ex- humation and excarnation incorporated (literally and figuratively) the deceased back into the com? munity. At a practical level, the ritual provided the opportunity for family and community rituals of integration or solidarity. The body at rest was put into motion, if only for a time, and this act was in a sense reciprocated at least in some instances by the apparent use of a few burial sites as locations for ongoing ritual activity (see below). That only portions ofthe skeletal remains were replaced into ossuaries, by design or accident, sug? gests that a token was sufficient to symbolize, rep? resent or carry the whole. The integrity ofthe re? mains was not an important practical or metaphysi- cal consideration, beyond perhaps those of infants. No greater contrast regarding post-mortem corpo- real integrity could be found than Egyptian burial practices from the Naqada I onward (Bard 1994). Bodily integrity reappeared as an issue during the Bronze Age with the emphasis on primary intra- mural burials and family tombs, but this impor-</page><page sequence="59">50 ALEXANDER h. joffe tant issue is beyond the scope of our discussion. What is more telling than the corporeal integrity ofthe body is the visibility of tombs. Outfitting Measuring Chalcolithic stratification and dif- ferentiation remains an extremely difficult exer- cise, worthy ofa dissertation-length treatment. The single greatest drawback continues to be establish? ing the contemporaneity of burials to determine whether synchronic or diachronic patterns are be? ing observed. Within the prevalent category of Chalcolithic burial, cave inhumation, a number of phases of reuse were noted, at least at larger sites such as Azor, but the timeframe is unclear. Asso- ciating assemblages of grave goods with specific burials is also extremely difficult in Chalcolithic caves. Echoing Levy and Alon's original approach, one could adopt the hypothesis that rank or status is reflected in the relative size or elaboration of decorated ossuaries, or in the case of Adeimah, the size of cists. These formal approaches deserve full exploration elsewhere. Several general patterns are, however, visible, which suggest that Chalcolithic mortuary practices were designed in part to reflect the individual "per- sonality" ofthe deceased, rather than more elabo? rate statements regarding social rank or status. The varieties of ossuaries have been extensively dis? cussed by Perrot and Ladiray (1980) and little need be added to their typological and stylistic conclu? sions. While some ossuaries are clearly stylized structures or contain symbolic decoration, the Peqicin examples suggest that the figural depic- tion of faces may have in some cases represented individuals. Hanbury-Tenison suggested that ossuaries may represent an elaboration ofthe long Neolithic tradition of jar burials (Hanbury-Tenison 1986:218). The most common grave good found through? out the various areas of Chalcolithic society is the v-shaped bowl, often found stacked around bod? ies or ossuaries. This form is the most common shape found at virtually all Chalcolithic sites in the southern Levant (see generally Commenge- Pellerin 1987,1990). The ubiquity ofthe v-shaped bowl suggests that these were symbolic ofthe in- dividual having attained full membership in the community. Other vessels include large bowls, jars, amphoriskoi, and less frequently, pedestalled stands and high-necked bottles. Other grave goods include a few examples of zoomorphic vessels, such as bird vessels (e.g., Palmachim; Gophna and Lifschitz 1980: figs. 5 and 6; Tadmor 1990), ba? salt vessels, stone, bead and shell ornaments, and few chipped stone tools and copper objects. Most objects found in Chalcolithic burials conform to standard typologies. Petrographic analyses have shown, however, that in some cases pottery from burial sites is likely to have been a low-quality product intended only for funerary purposes (Goren 1990). Very large storage vessels are also absent from mortuary assemblages, indicating that the living were unwilling to invest the resources necessary to create large-scale specialized ceram? ics, sacrifice daily vessels, or that they were not necessary to serve or identify the deceased. Over? all, the Chalcolithic mortuary assemblage is an imi? tation of daily assemblages. Coupled with the lack of animal remains from mortuary contexts, it seems reasonable to suggest that burial sites were neither the scene of ritual feasts, nor were the deceased equipped with food for an extended journey or sojourn. In metaphysi- cal terms this suggests a limited concept of the afterlife, or one where the deceased could easily and quickly find sustenance. In practical terms it suggests further that burial sites were not typically the setting for competitive display among the liv? ing, although this certainly may have gone on else? where, such as in the residence. The simplicity and sparseness of mortuary assemblages is a further indicator of the unwillingness or inability to re- move large quantities of wealth from circulation, save in the largest sites where those principles were more relaxed, or in truly exceptional circum- stances, such as the Nahal Qana cave. Death and the Landscape A larger question is whether variability in Chalcolithic mortuary practices primarily indicates negotiation or reinforcement of relationships among the living, including inequality (e.g., Kuijt 1996; cf. Byrd and Monahan 1995), or addresses</page><page sequence="60">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 51 metaphysical concerns. A related question is whether mortuary behavior represents collective or individualizing tendencies, indicative of social and political organization. As noted above, the integrity of post-mortem remains was not an overriding concern in Chalcolithic society. The locations of burial are, however, strongly suggestive of different rituals and roles. Specifically, there are strong contrasts between dominant forms of cave burials and much less common cairns and grave circles. A key dis? tinction is between private and less communally visible practices of primary and secondary burial in caves, and those that took place in the much more public arena of cemeteries. All burials, reburial or modification of burials were likely a setting for some community involvement, but like subfloor burials, those that took place in caves uti? lized a more restricted spatial and social setting. The burial, reburial or modification of remains in grave circles, tumuli or dolmens, events that took place above ground, such as at the extramural cem? eteries at Shiqmim, which stretch for over a kilo? meter along the hills above the Nahal Beersheva, and at Mezad Aluf (Levy et al. 1990, 1994; Levy and Alon 1982,1985), were visible to the commu? nity. The small semi-circular stone structures cov- ering piles of children's bones in Tell Abu Matar level IIB are also notable in this regard (Perrot 1955). These public settings created ongoing vis? ible statements on the landscape, through which the community at large operated daily. In sharp contrast, the cave and pit burials of the Coastal Plain stand out for their invisibility on the living landscape. Caves were reused for long periods, often being utilized initially for habita- tion. At Azor only one tomb was recovered, but it contained over one hundred ossuaries from two phases of use (Perrot 1961; Perrot and Ladiray 1980). At Bnei Braq eleven tombs were noted (Ory 1946). Six tombs were excavated at Ben Shemen and there is an apparently stratified sequence of ossuaries and grave goods, fill indicative of aban? donment, habitation debris, and then more burial remains (Perrot and Ladiray 1980: 70). Many other caves are known, such as the thirteen chambers at Givatayim (Sussman and Beit-Arieh 1966), one cave at Hadera (Sukenik 1937) and Ma'abarot (Paley and Porath 1979), eleven tombs at Palmachim, some with both Chalcolithic and EB I materials (Gophna and Lifshitz 1980), and more recently excavated examples from Qula (Milevski 2001), Shoham (Gophna and van den Brink 1998), and Sha5ar Ephraim (Oren and Scheftelowitz 1998). The cave sites must be viewed in a larger con? text. Increasing numbers of Chalcolithic habita- tion sites are known from the coastal plain, foot? hills and central hills, indicating that the cave buri? als are not simply the remains of transhumant pastoralists or other periodic visitors, as was once proposed (e.g., Perrot 1984; Levy and Alon 1987). Among the large Chalcolithic villages of the coastal plain are Macayan David near Dor (Gophna 1974:22; Gibson et al. 1999), En Assawir (Yannai 2002), and possibly Jatt, Tel Lod, and Tell Guvrin (Gophna 1974: 28, 33, 54). Smaller clusters of settlements were noted by Kaplan within the Tel Aviv area (Kaplan 1959). The overall settlement pattern is one of clusters of sites along the major wadi systems with higher density in the Tel Aviv area, which include a few open villages in the north (Assawir, Dor) and south (Lod, Azor?) surrounded by smaller settlements and dispersed strings of caves along the eastern borders and many open campsites along dunes and ridges (e.g., Gophna 1992; Gophna and Portugali 1988). Between the coastal clusters there is a much lower settlement density, as recent surveys such as the Lod and Rosh Ha-cAyin maps have shown (Gophna and Beit-Arieh 1997; Kochavi and Beit- Arieh 1994). A low density of Chalcolithic settle? ment, with many specialized sites, is also found in the Carmel Range (Olami 1984). Further inland in southern Samaria, with the notable exception of the Nahal Qana cave, Chalcolithic settlement in virtually absent (Finkelstein et al. 1997). Slightly higher densities are known to the south in the hill country of Benjamin, in part through excavations (Finkelstein and Magen 1993), as well as to the north, in the Menasshe hills (Zertal 1992). Mortuary sites are primarily located within the major clusters of karstic caves, and the largest, such as Azor, could be defined as cemeteries, which if not supralocal may have served a small surround? ing area. But unlike the cemeteries at Shiqmim,</page><page sequence="61">A DEFENSE OF VIRTUE ETHICS IN BUSINESS 61 Caspi, A., and B. W. Roberts. 1999.

Stephen Bourke makes the intriguing suggestion that the Adeimah, Bab edh- Dhra', and Nahal Mishmar "enclosures" comprise a "coherent Dead Sea regional funerary culture" in contrast to the "coastal/upland cave and ossuary culture" (Bourke 2002: 17). These do not indicate social hierarchy but rather the opposite, tribal or? ganization that used aboveground locations includ? ing burials as sites for periodic interaction (e.g., Marx 1977). The elaboration of mortuary practices in the Beersheva clusters indicate more hierarchical so? cial and economic structures, where more re? sources could be invested in permanent, visible mortuary statements. At none of these sites, how? ever, are their outsized monuments indicative of individuals or clans that held leadership role. The dearth of visible monuments in other Chalcolithic regions indicates that even such "bourgeois" ten- dencies could not be sustained. These mortuary observations raise the ques? tion of Chalcolithic leadership. The lack of clearly differentiated monuments, elaborate grave goods, and the extremely limited geographic range of "elite" mortuary behavior suggests that territorial chiefs did not prevail, even at core clusters such as Beersheva and Ghassul. Rather, leadership was centered on Chalcolithic religio-political elites similar to shamans or "priests". Their earthly power was sufficient to control procurement of certain key materials, such as copper and ivory, the manufacture of symbolic objects such as stan? dards, and their ritual disposal. Outside of a tiny corpus of seals and "tokens" (Bourke 2002: 12- 14) there remains no evidence for any substantive administrative or economic activities, such as so? cial storage or sealing. Beyond Ghassul itself and the Beersheva clus? ters there is an almost complete lack of any comple- mentary evidence for social differentiation or spe- cialization. Evidence from the coastal plain, Jor? dan Valley, highlands, and arid zones suggests that extended families and larger kin structures, such as clans, marked territorial claims with generic de- vices, including burials. Overall, tribalism, not chiefdoms, provided the Chalcolithic risk abate? ment strategies, based on the pooling of resources across broader landscapes, rather than through concentration within sites. Religion, including mortuary rituals and shamans, provided a mecha- nism for integrating otherwise separate and diverse groups. Death and Cult The symbolism of the Chalcolithic period is remarkably consistent in all areas of settlement (Epstein 1978,1982). The metaphysical beliefs of Chalcolithic society were probably similar throughout; what differed is how these beliefs were developed and executed within different commu- nities. In terms of mortuary behavior, there seems to have been fairly minimal cultic concern. The least elaborate burials were simply primary inhumations in pits, a procedure that likely entailed very few steps. Infants were simply placed in a jar and buried within the household structure. Sec? ondary burials were more involved. The deceased was buried and exhumed after a suitable period. During the period of initial burial funerary ves? sels were made, sometimes including an ossuary. The deceased was exhumed, defleshed and a sample of bones placed in an ossuary, which was then situated in a cave or other tomb. Ceremonies could have taken place at any point during the pro? cess, but the burial site was not the setting for sig? nificant offerings of gifts, although feasting can? not be ruled out. In the context ofa discussion ofa skull in a bowl at Arpachiyah, Ippolitoni-Strika (1990) suggests the vessel was a "portable shrine" and specifically raises the question of southern Levantine ossuaries as model shrines. At the community and regional levels the pic? ture is obviously much more complex. While ritu? als were no doubt complex, there is little to sug? gest community-wide involvement, either through ritual participation or gift-giving. The visual (and performative) elements of burial may be inter? preted in a minimalist fashion (cf. Kuijt 1996). Shiqmim and Ghassul are obvious examples where slightly higher degrees of stratification and differ- entiation were manifest in public mortuary behav- iors. The interspersal of burial caves among habi- tation sites in the Coastal Plain and Jordan Valley created a hidden geography that mapped out so? cial boundaries. Other caves, however, are likely to have been the centers of ongoing rituals.</page><page sequence="63">54 ALEXANDER H. JOFFE The Nahal Qana and Peqi cin caves stand apart (Gopher 1996; Gal et al. 1996, 1997). Both caves are located inland in regions with very little Chalcolithic habitation, making it uncertain where the interred individuals originally resided. Both were originally utilized during the Pottery Neolithic period, with Nahal Qana cave being re- used in the early EB I. Both have multiple levels, with constructed walls and terraces along which ossuaries and other materials were placed. The Nahal Qana cave is far larger, consisting of five levels of multiple rooms or chambers that descend over twenty-five meters into the ground. The Peqicin cave is "only" 17&gt;&lt;7 meters and could fit into the "Main Hall" ofthe Nahal Qana cave. The Nahal Qana cave was exceptionally well-exca- vated and well-published, while Peqicin is known from a series of preliminary reports. Both caves contain a wealth of Chalcolithic material culture. The Peqicin cave was occupied in an earlier period before being converted to mor? tuary use. Among the finds from the latter phase are ossuaries, some with separable lids and three- dimensional human features, burials in jars, some with trumpet bases and lids, copper standards, flint tools, including perforated disk tools, an ivory figu? rine, ten violin shaped figurines and unique three dimensional sculpted human heads with plastic noses, eyes, teeth and ears. The assemblage con? tains items from the Golan, Coastal, Jordan Val? ley, and Beersheva aspects of the Developed Chalcolithic, together for the first time. Dating the unique convergence of items also demonstrates radiometrically the contemporaneity of those as? pects in the Developed Chalcolithic (Segal et al. 1998). It also raises the question of who is buried in the cave and what other activities went on there. The Nahal Qana cave contains ceramics, in? cluding bowls, jars, churns and at least twenty- two ossuaries similar to those ofthe coastal plain, 101 basalt vessels, some pedestalled, hematite maceheads, bone and ivory objects, including per? forated hippopotamus tusk plaques, beads and jew? elry, a few shells and flint tools, including a disk shaped scraper, ostrich egg shell and human re? mains (Gopher and Tsuk 1996a). The most stun- ning finds are the metal objects: copper wires, lumps, a standard, a "crown" (similar to objects from the Nahal Mishmar cave), and the eight ham- mered gold and electrum rings (Gopher and Tsuk 1996b). Importantly, all ofthe twenty-two indi? viduals identified lacked any cranial remains, and most were under the age of twenty (Hershkovitz and Gopher 1996). The animal bone assemblages indicate both the presence of inhabitants such as carnivores, reptiles and rodents, and burnt and cut bones of caprids and pigs, and smaller numbers of others, including fish (Horwitz 1996). These lat? ter animals were either brought to the cave by hu? mans and presented as offerings or consumed, or they were dragged in by carnivores, which were also responsible for some of the damage on the human remains. This ambiguous finding is re? peated at the recently excavated Sha'ar Ephraim Central cave (Smith and Kolska-Horwitz 1998). The careful excavation and comparatively more spacious setting ofthe Nahal Qana cave made it possible to map the distribution of burials and associated materials (Gopher and Tsuk 1996c). The gold and electrum items, for example, are associ? ated with at least four individuals: a small child, a child, an adolescent and an adult. Levy regards this as the burial of an "individualizing chief," al? though of where or what is unclear (Levy 1995: 235).The excavators point out that the larger the number of clustered individuals, the richer the grave goods, and that individual burials tend to be poorer (Gopher and Tsuk 1996c: 226). It is logical to assume that the groups represent families, but like Peqicin, the site presents numerous problems if it is interpreted as simply a burial cave. The sites were clearly utilized for burials over a period of several centuries, but it must be asked whether other activities went on as well. The absence of any nearby habitations, the presence of materials from many parts of the Chalcolithic southern Levant, the comparative elaboration ofthe mortuary practices, and the re? moval of substantial wealth, in the form of metals and craft goods, are all unique features of these sites. These should be juxtaposed with the overall absence of overt, specialized cult or ritual struc? tures at Chalcolithic sites, except Ghassul, En Gedi, and Gilat, and the domestic focus of cult in the Golan sites. Furthermore there is the contin? ued strong association of religious symbolism with</page><page sequence="64">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 55 specific craft products in metal and ivory, known from the Nahal Mishmar cave and other finds. In short, it may be suggested that the Peqicin and Nahal Qana caves were burials of individuals or families who had regional significance as religio? political figures, shamans, and that these caves had a continuing role in Chalcolithic cult. These data suggest that Nahal Qana, Peqicin and perhaps even Qula (Milevski 2001) were not simply burial places, but rather the centers of on- going cult secret cult activities. The best compa? randa may be found in Neolithic and Copper Age Italy. Whitehouse has described a large number of caves which have evidence of burials, deposits of food and artifacts, activities related to stalagmites, and wall paintings, and suggests an overall theme of secrecy (Whitehouse 1991,1992). Shebelieves they are related to rites of passage, including ini- tiation and the transmission of secret ritual and cosmological knowledge, managed by ritual spe? cialists capable of containing powerful and dan- gerous forces, and rituals connected to burials. Some of her inferences derive from wall paint? ings within the caves, detailed features missing from the southern Levant. Ritual use of caves is known in later periods such as the EB IV (e.g., Qedesh; Tadmor 1978). Complex rituals specifically connected to burial and intervention with the dead are also a part of household cult in the MB and later. It may be sug? gested that the caves were perhaps the burial places of especially powerful shamans, and were used for spirit consultation, training, or initiation into secret societies. Like shamanism, secret societies and other cross-cutting organizations have not been adequately discussed in Near Eastern archaeology (cf. Owens and Hayden 1997). Further compara? tive material is to be found in the village cultures of the American Southwest, a topic that deserves separate study elsewhere (e.g., Adler 1993; Bayman 2002). Other examples of regional cult sites include the En Gedi temple, serving the populations ofthe Judean desert (Ussishkin 1980) and the Gilat "temple," with its famous figurines and material culture from many areas ofthe Chalcolithic south? ern Levant (Alon and Levy 1989,1990), suggested to be the center of another important shaman (Joffe et al. 2001). The presence at the Nahal Qana and Peqicin caves of material culture from all parts of the southern Levant, even more far-flung than that found at Gilat, suggests that these were especially important cult sites. While the rituals that were carried out remain obscure, it is clear that the sites were utilized for many centuries. Simply in those terms, a religious association is more plausible than a political or "chiefly" one. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS Three cross-cultural comparisons, or more correctly contrasts, are instructive, since they il? lustrate paths that the Chalcolithic southern Le? vant did not, or could not, take. The contemporary cultures of Late Neolithic Mesopotamia and Naqada I?III Egypt demonstrate the roles of envi? ronment and production in social organization and power. In both cases, vastly more productive irri? gation agriculture systems necessitated the devel? opment of larger social units, both domestic and institutional. In both areas, chief-like individuals developed institutional functions that linked stor? age, craft production, administration and religion. While religious institutions or leaders appear to have been among the first to emerge, the comple- mentary development of economic specialization and larger household and landowning units are key factors that distinguish Egyptian and Mesopo- tamian societies from their contemporaries (see generally Bernbeck 1994). A number of features illustrate contrasts in level and trend between Mesopotamian and south? ern Levantine societies. In the southern Levant there are occasional examples of ascription mani- fest in mortuary behavior, suggestive of social ranking, such as the burial of children in a grave circle at Shiqmim. These appear in within a wide variety of practices and cannot be linked to a single institution. In contrast, the numerous sixth millen? nium burials of children and elaborate grave goods, including the famous alabaster figurines found below apparently religious buildings in Level I at Tell es-Sawwan indicate both ascription and an institutional association. They also show another feature generally lacking in the southern Levant, the removal of large quantities of exotic goods</page><page sequence="65">56 ALEXANDER H. JOFFE from circulation (Youkana 1997: 36-41; cf. Breniquet 1991, 1992). While not necessarily in- dicative ofa highly stratified society, the evidence from Tell es-Sawwan does show a trajectory to? ward mortuary elaboration and institutional devel? opment clearly different from that ofthe southern Levant (cf. Campbell 1995). There are other indicators that point to the development of full-time, highly visible ascriptive elites, probably connected in part with religion, in Late Neolithic Syria and Mesopotamia. The prac- tice of skull deformation produced a category of individuals with highly distinctive crania, visible in life and death alike. The earliest examples are from Ganj Dareh and Ali Kosh (Meikeljohn et al. 1992), and the practice appears from both osteo? logical and artistic evidence to have been much more widespread during the Halaf and Ubaid pe? riods (Molleson and Campbell 1995). To produce the deformation, the skulls of children had to be bound at an early age, creating another highly vis? ible ascribed category of individuals within the society (Arensburg and Hershkovitz 1988). It is significant that the practice is very poorly attested in the southern Levant, but is found at Byblos (Ozbekl974). By the Ubaid period the appearance of spe- cialized "temples" (or elite residences) at sites such as Eridu and Tepe Gawra (Forest 1987,1999), the expansion of seals and sealing (e.g., Rothman 1994), and a variety of mortuary activities all point to underlying principles of power and social orga? nization. Ubaid mortuary behavior contrasts strongly with the Chalcolithic southern Levant and demonstrates the emergence of fully-specialized religious and corporate institutions and positions of leadership by late in the period (Wright and Pollock 1987). Even with a continued level of in? fant jar burials in the Ubaid, a constant "back? ground noise" in village-level societies from the Neolithic onward, the presence of several enor- mous cemeteries, such as at Eridu and Susa (and possibly Parchinah and Hakalan), points to the centrality of ritual places for burials and highly specialized craft production (Hole 1989, 1992; Vertesalji 1989; Haerinck and Overlaet 1996). The burials below the ritual structure at Tell Abada indicate further strong institutional associations and identities (Jasim 1989). Stein notes the evidence for economic differ- entiation, centralized storage of staples, rural pro? duction of surpluses, village-based craft produc? tion, and ritual and kin-based surplus mobiliza- tion, all consistent with a staple finance system (Stein 1994: 41). Some of these features are also consistent with the overall picture ofthe southern Levant, with the obvious exception of evidence for centralized storage of surpluses. Chalcolithic elites may have been able to extract and redirect surpluses at the largest sites, but nothing suggests they could do so outside those sites. The Chalcolithic evidence also reflects certain aspects of a prestige or wealth-based system, such as the use of exotic goods as status markers and the at? tachment of craft specialists to elites (Stein 1994: 41; 1998: 6-7). Conspicuously absent from the southern Levant, however, is evidence for elite access to a variety of foreign connections and goods (M. W. Helms 1988)?a feature vitally im? portant to emerging Egyptian elites from the Naqada I through the Old Kingdom?or any sig? nificant level of warfare or other competition. Only the elite metalworking industry can be suggested to have provided Chalcolithic elites with "foreign" associations, albeit with arid zone nomads and miners (Shalev 1994; Tadmor et al. 1995). The lacunae point to the shortcomings of ma- terialist approaches to small-scale societies, which privilege the spatial, demographic and economic at the expense ofthe ideological. They further in? dicate the need to examine all forms or sources of social power, including religious, their particular ratios, and to understand factors that constrain or permit the development of mixtures in certain cir- cumstances (Yoffee 1993). As the case ofthe Chalcolithic southern Levant shows, religious power with little social and economic power has limited potential for growth. In Egypt, Naqada II and III elites successfully fused religio-political ideology and the generation of new symbols, economic power (especially over craft production) and the pursuit of critical raw materials and technologies, such as copper metal? lurgy, to create territorially expansive "chiefdoms" and ultimately a unified state (Seeher 1991; Hassan 1997). Hassan has pointed out that the emergence of religio-political elites in Egypt involved the in-</page><page sequence="66">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 57 tegration of female iconography and ideology into a male-controlled system of religious authority and craft production (Hassan 1992). In the context of mortuary behavior, the progressive elaboration of rituals had a direct connection to increasing de- mands for craft products (Endesfelder 1984; Bard 1994). Closer at land, comparisons with roughly con? temporary "Eneolithique" Byblos are revealing. There, and at the site of Sidon-Dakkerman, large amounts of wealth were taken out of circulation inpit, cist, and jar burials. Ceramics, jewelry, metal items, and other objects are all found, associated with both adults and children (Chehab 1949; Dunand 1973; Saideh 1979; de Contenson 1982; cf. Ben-Tor 1989). While the precise dating of these sites is problematic, and the overall level of complexity is still comparatively low in the fourth millennium, the trends towards manipulating mor? tuary ritual as a means of mobilizing labor, and general individualizing behavior, are clear. The only Chalcolithic burial site in the southern Le? vant at which exceptional quantities of wealth are present is the Nahal Mishmar cave, which is both unique and exceptionally late in the period (Moorey 1988). The removal of wealth in burials is a key ele? ment of difference between the southern and north? ern Levant. In the southern Levant ritual burial of cult objects is well-known from the Early Neolithic (e.g., cAin Ghazal, see now Schmandt-Besserat 1998; cf. Garfinkel 1994), but Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic evidence is far more scanty. In the northern Levant, however, this pattern continued both within the contexts of elite burial and reli? gious institution. Immense hoards were buried within various temple complexes at the end ofthe third millennium, such as the "Montet jar" (Tufnell and Ward 1966). These point to elite control over large-scale craft production, including the acqui- sition of precious metals, consumption through burial, necessitating additional production, ad? equate levels of surplus production and mobiliza- tion, and legimitating ideologies. In these respects the northern Levant is more comparable to the "chiefly" societies of early Europe (Bradley 1990). In the long-term, it is not surprising that the king? dom of Late Bronze Age Ugarit owned hundreds of villages (Heltzer 1976), when its southern con- temporaries could barely keep the Hab/piru from the door. The roots of inequality in the northern Levant were far deeper than in the south. Finally, Chalcolithic mortuary evidence should be contrasted with that of the Early Bronze Age southern Levant. During the EB I formal cemeter? ies in close proximity to settlements are well- known, such as at Jericho, Bab edh-Dhrac, and Tel Assawir (Kenyon 1960,1965; Lapp 1968; Schaub and Rast 1989; Dothan 1970; Zigelman 1978; Yannai 2002). Many more unpublished examples are known, such as those near Tell el-Far cah North and En Hanasiv, near Beth Shan. Infant jar burials become extremely rare during the EB I (cf. Tell Teo; Eisenberg et al. 2001). Rather than being in- terspersed among living communities, during EB II-III individual tombs are located at greater re- move from settlements, such as Kinneret (Mazar et al. 1973), Beit Sahur (Hennessy 1966), Arqub el-Dhahr (Parr 1956), Asherat (Smithline 2001), and Gadot (Greenberg 2001). With the obvious exception of Bab edh-Dhrac, cemeteries are rare. Interestingly, the practice of extremely large cemeteries reemerges forcefully during the EB IV, with examples such as Dhahr Mirzbaneh, Sinjil, cAin es-Samiyeh, and Khirbet Kirmil (Dever 1972, 1975a, 1975b, 1987), and large clusters of tombs in the Amman area (e.g., Ibrahim and Qadi 1995). Among the many features that distinguish EB I mortuary practices from those ofthe Chalcolithic are the immense quantities of grave goods. The tombs at Assawir, for example, contain many hun? dreds of vessels, suggesting either conspicuous display or different metaphysical principles at work. In this early period as well, however, petro- graphic analysis shows that low quality ceramics were probably manufactured specifically for mor? tuary use (Goren 1990). Prestige items such as the silver vessel from Tell el-Farcah North (Amiran 1979) and the development of silver metallurgy generally (Rehren et al. 1997) demonstrate wholly new sorts of investments. In the EB II-III, vessels are not heaped into burials as in the EB I, but form representative samples of domestic assemblages. The dramatic renegotiation of social power in EB I entailed changes in relations of production, which</page><page sequence="67">58 ALEXANDER H. JOFFE saw the development of a strong link between elites, craft production, and consumption. By the EB II-III diacritical behavior no longer required massive labor output, but more focus on proper, high quality furnishings. EB tombs gener? ally were equipped with foodstuffs, either the re? mains of feasts or offerings. This avenue for dis? play and consumption coincided with the growth of Mediterranean crop production as a key "cash crop" (Joffe 1998; Rosen 1997). The appearance of more widely dispersed tombs, probably of fami? lies, also indicates a more intense relationship with the land. The act of conveying the deceased to a family tomb situated on or near landholdings was a new kind of public statement, of possession, as? sociation, and kinship (see generally Philip 2001). Production is the keynote in the Early Bronze Age and beyond. The final breakdown of the "moral economy" that had been fading since the Upper Paleolithic was complete with the emer? gence of urbanism and ruralism, the marginali- zation of women, inequality based on economics and accumulation, and the end of the southern Levant's isolation from other cultures, stronger and more organized polities, predators, on the verge of empire. Death and burial became extensions of the competition and inequalities that life had be? come. That for a few brief episodes, the EB IV and Iron I, the centripetal forces broke down sug? gests that certain kinds of complexity are, to some extent, reversible. But only in collapse would the southern Levant again find its centrifiigal nature. CONCLUSIONS Religion was the single most important prin- ciple in Chalcolithic society, and power strategy for Chalcolithic elites. Their problem was that there simply was not enough complementary so? cial or economic power available to orchestrate a leap to higher levels of settlement or organizational complexity. The reasons for this have been out- lined above, primarily the low levels of agricul? tural surpluses available to any one individual or "polity." The same problem of scale existed in much later periods as well, hence the fragmented economic and political landscapes of the Bronze and Iron ages, when unity was the exception rather than the rule, brought about by external forces such as imperialism, or unusual convergences of inter? nal factors, such as imperial weakness, new tech- nologies and new ideologies (Joffe 2002). Part of this weakness was forced by the fragmented land? scape, which indicated centrifugal rather than cen? tripetal strategies for social survival. That resis- tance to complexity became encoded in later ide? ologies is also a unique feature of the historic southern Levant (Joffe 1993). That rising and col- lapsing complexity became a metaphysical and moral parable indicates this small-scale complex society had, in a sense, embodied an essential fea? ture ofthe human experience. Several evolutionary observations are pos? sible. In specific terms, the mortuary evidence sharpens our view of the elements of both conti? nuity and disjunction between the Chalcolithic and the Early Bronze Age. Population, household pro? duction and cult, and in some cases settlements, continue from one period to another. In contrast, the larger political and economic contexts of the household changed dramatically. The geography of socio-economic development changes in the Early Bronze Age, from a solely agro-pastoral landscape to one based in some places on Medi? terranean crop production, in others on copper or ceramic production and in still others trading all the above, supported by different levels of agro- pastoral production. In general terms, the Chalcolithic southern Levant is an example of a very different sort of evolutionary trajectory. Rather than proceeding from chiefdoms to states, and villages to cities in an orderly fashion, the southern Levant develops from shamans to collective leadership and from villages to villages and towns in a most uneven way. Mortuary behavior is dragged along as well. One key point is that small-scale societies retain tremendous internal variability, in defiance of evo? lutionary typologizing. Another is that small-scale societies make up the vast majority of archaeo? logical and historical examples, thereby render- ing inapplicable evolutionary theorizing based on core civilizations or cultures, or ethnographic ex? amples. In the end, death is the final leveler, and Chalcolithic society retained enough sense of this</page><page sequence="68">CHALCOLITHIC MORTUARY PRACTICES IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL CONTEXT 59 reality, in part through its Paleolithic heritage of "egalitarianism", to not misappropriate the sweet hereafter as a setting for earthly competition.

Thepreponderance ofutilitarian ceramics, ground stone and small structures implies a limited range of activities at sites here designated as workstations. The proposed workstations were contemporaneous with habitation sites, buri? als, and sacred spaces located elsewhere. Differences in the location, size, and assemblage composition at these four sites categories contrasted with similarities detected in certain ce? ramics and architecture. When viewed together in terms ofthe activities carried out at each type ofsite, despite the apparent discrepancies in artifacts, the sites complimented each other and represented a multi-faceted society that copedwith a challenging environment and social landscape. Archaeology contributes to the awareness and evidence of ordinary people whose leaders and societies are recorded in the Hebrew Bible (Dever 2001: 74). W. G. Dever has observed that names derived from the Bible and assigned to pots, peoples, in fact our entire disci? pline, have repercussions for the ancient sites cho? sen for excavation as well as subsequent interpre? tations ofthe data (Dever 1985,1990,1993,1995a, 1995b, 1998, 1999). Here I examine archaeologi? cal remains excavated in central Israel/Palestine at late second millennium b.c.e. hill country sites known for their limited habitation space and mini- mal artifact diversity. Aproposal follows concern- ing the function of these small sites, their rela? tionship to other types of sites, as well as an as- sessment of the archaeological remains of those who are largely invisible in biblical texts. TRANSITIONAL LB/ IRON I AGE HILL COUNTRY SITES Hundreds of small sites, often characterized by a relatively short period of duration towards the end ofthe second millennium b.c.e., have been recorded for the hills of Israel/Palestine (Zertal 1986-87; Finkelstein 1988,1988-89,1996,1999; Mazar 1990a: 334-36; Campbell 1991; Finkelstein and Magen 1993; Finkelstein, Lederman and Bunimovitz 1997; Finkelstein and Zertal 1997). In the region of Samaria, sites frequently located on hilltops adjacent to valleys ranged in size from less than two acres to twenty acres, but further south, architectural remains were found on smaller sites, 1-1.5 acres, hidden on remote hilltops (Mazar 1990a: 335). In addition to small sites were the more substantial LB II and Iron I tell deposits. 69</page><page sequence="78">70 GLORIA LONDON Sites traditionally designated as Iron I Age include Shiloh, cAi, Bethel, Khirbet Raddanah, cIzbet Sartah, Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell el-Far cah (N) and Tell el-Ful. Slightly to the south is Giloh (Mazar 1981). Bloch-Smith and Nakhai (1999) have assembled the pertinent sites in their overview of the Iron I Age landscape (fig. 1). In the central hill country the proliferation of very small sites began in the fifteenth century b.ce. and climaxed in the last centuries of the second millennium, based on a study of site size, distri? bution and date (Gonen 1984). At times, the dis? tinction between LB II and Iron I Age material culture at both large and very small sites mentioned above is unclear (Kletter 2002: 33-35) and based on what is absent, especially decorated pottery. This absence reflects to a large extent, the lack of richness or variety in the assemblages rather than a dislike or unavailability of decorated pots. As a whole, the ceramic repertoire ofthe last centuries of the second millennium was derivative of Late Bronze Age traditions. Despite the difficulties in dating the sites, un- less the presence of LB II deposits in the central hills is acknowledged, it would mean that the Late Bronze Age population never ventured into the hills. To envisage the forested hills as unknown, unexplored, or outside the purview of the LB II lowland population is untenable. Stager consid? ered the highland villagers as "well advanced in the techniques of terrace agriculture when they established their settlements de novo on hilltops ..." but of Iron I date (1985: 6). In contrast, the terrace builders were neither Late Bronze Age ur- banites nor nomads, but "local village farmers, long since adapted to natural conditions in Cana'an ..." (Dever 1991: 83). Would people in the adja? cent lowlands not have realized that certain grains, fruits, legumes, spices, and medicinal plants as well as wild life, flourished at higher elevations but not at lower altitudes? Would herders not have taken their animals to feed on the slopes? Would the cool summer nights in the hills not have en- ticed people to leave the hot, humid lowlands and coastal strip? If lowland residents engaged in any of these activities, their archaeological remains would be a challenge to uncover. Ephemeral sum? mer lodgings of plant and animal fibers left little trace. Summertime picnics left no pottery sherds. If constructed terraced slopes for farming were not part of the Late Bronze Age landscape, the alter- native scenario would require a transitional LB/ Iron I population to have established permanent settlements predicated on terrace farming, which they immediately mastered. The complex system of converting soil-poor hills into crop-producing agricultural terraces sufficient to provide the ne- cessities for survival required considerable time and effort (Hopkins 1987:190). Such an endeavor could have started with crops raised on the hills during the LB II and carried down to permanent homes and communities in the lowlands, after ini? tial processing in the hill country. HILL COUNTRY TERRACED FARMING DEVELOPMENT Lowlanders would have been induced to cul- tivate the artificially created terraced fields on the slopes for two reasons, ecology and economy. Ecologically, the higher elevation was better suited to certain trees and plants than the lowlands. 01- ives and vineyards prefer hills where terraced farms accommodated their needs. Grains thrive in open expanses of valleys of lower elevations. In terms of economics, Egyptian overlords and local rulers extracted taxes and tribute from the popu- lace (Weinstein 1981). To designate types of land surrounding Megiddo, Egyptian documents in? cluded one term for the arable plots and another for the fields (considered as non-farmland). Po? litical functionaries, who controlled the arable plots, exacted a tax on the produce. In contrast, the fields of non-farmland were neither arable nor property ofthe authorities (Na'aman 1981). Pre- sumably it would have been easier to tax produce, such as grains, from the arable lands than from the fields located outside the arable land, possibly in the central hill country. Residents of the low? land could have exploited the slopes to supple? ment and compensate for the taxed produce, de? spite initial low and unpredictable yields from trees and crops grown at the higher elevations. The Egyptian perspective of the region dis? tinguished between the coastal conduit and the less penetrable hilly interior (Gonen 1992: 37).

Over generations, low? land residents could have increased their hill coun? try agricultural investment incrementalry to in? clude terraced slopes and fruit trees, but never on a grand scale. The geomorphological configura- tion of the dissected Judaean Hills favored con? struction of terraced fields on a local scale, rather than large systems of terraced slopes created at once (Ron 1966). To avoid taxes, workstations in the hill country could have been positioned on re-</page><page sequence="80">72 GLORIA LONDON mote hilltops far from the eyes and ears ofthe au- thorities, while farmers still maintained lowland fields. Initially the agricultural terraces provided an additional food resource, and only subsequently could the crops be a year-long part ofthe diet, suf? ficient for permanent residency at nearby villages. Several aspects inherent to terrace farming impose limitations on our ability to establish their date, not the least of which was their structural uniformity throughout the ages (Mayerson 1960: 33). Bedrock composed of hard and soft limestone throughout Judaea and Samaria has resulted in dif- ferential weathering rates ofthe calcareous foun? dation. Stone terraces formed naturally, but the work required to create agricultural terraces was formidable. In comparison with other rocks, ero? sion of limestone yielded minimal quantities of soil at a very slow rate of deposition. Without trees or shrubs to hold the soil in place, heavy winter rains washed away the meager, naturally occur- ring soil. Terrace farming was feasible on the slopes only if soil was brought from elsewhere and piled behind artificially constructed stonewalls. Often, the soil was taken from ancient sites along with ancient sherds, a practice complicating our ability to determine the age of terrace construc? tion. Early and Middle Bronze Age agricultural terraces, associated with domestic debris of com? parable date, are among the most reliably dated terraced fields in the Judaean Hills (Gophna and Porath 1972: 197; Edelstein and Kislev 1981; Edelstein and Gibson 1985; Gibson 2001). MATERIAL ASSEMBLAGES AT TRANSITIONAL LB/IRONI SITES The ceramic repertoire, ground stone imple? ments, and vernacular architecture are the three features most indicative of activities carried out at the small hill country sites. Ceramics Mazar (1990a: 345-46) noted the limited ce? ramic repertoire at the unimpressive hill country sites, as had Albright (1949: 119). Whereas the small number of vessel types was once attributed to the egalitarian nature ofthe society and a "lack of cultural sophistication" (Albright 1949: 119), Mazar (1990a: 345-46) recognized that the ceram? ics were restricted to simple subsistence activi? ties, storage jars and cooking pots. Decorated and small portable jugs and bowls, for example, were non-existent or scarce. Regardless of a designa? tion of transitional LB/Iron I, Iron I or Israelite, the paucity of artifacts and lack of diversity in ar? tifact categories allowed for a limited number of activities confmed entirely to food production, including growing, harvesting, processing, cook? ing, preparing, preserving and storing. Ceramics included predominantly food-processing equip? ment. At Giloh, cooking ware, storage jars and pithoi constituted eighty percent of the finds (Mazar 1982b: 169). A variety of parallels with the LB II ceramic tradition persisted at Giloh (Mazar 1982b: 170) and Raddanah, while collared rim storage jars are usually associated with the transitional LB/Iron I and Iron Age I. Ground Stone Implements Heavy stone tools abound at hilltop sites. At Raddanah, millstones, pestles and mortars were found in "astounding" quantity (Callaway and Cooley 1971: 14), as was pottery useful for food processing. At Giloh, several limestone saddle querns and many limestone or flint hemispherical pestles are the largest artifact category after pots (Mazar 1990b: 80). Another hill country site, Mt. Ebal, yielded comparable pestles (Zertal 1986-87: 148-49). Abundant grinding tools imply that food processing was a primary occupation, especially given the paucity of other artifact categories. The absence of artifacts, such as decorated pot? tery indicative of conspicuous consumption, and the abundance of grinding equipment need not imply an egalitarian society, but instead reveal a material assemblage best understood as a work- station for food processing. Sites stockpiled heavy querns, grinding tools, and utilitarian pottery. Vernacular Architecture The four-room or "pillared house" type at LB/ Iron I sites, large and small, had a narrow rear broad</page><page sequence="81">FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES AT HILL COUNTRY WORKSTATIONS 73 JfT^ 15 m Fig. 2 Four-room houses development based on examples from Tell Masos and Tel Isdar. room that was situated behind a larger space, which was divided into three narrow rectilinear areas by stone pillars or post bases aligned in two rows (fig. 2). LB II houses at Tel Batash are comparable in form, but the style became more common for all regions in the LB/Iron I era (Mazar 1990a: 340), extending east to Tell el-cUmayri (Clark 1996), south to Tel Masos (Fritz: 1987: 84-85) and south? east to Khirbet el-Mudayna el-cAliya (Routledge 2000: 50-54, fig. 10). Pillar construction utilized monolithic round or square stones, smaller circu? lar stones piled on top of one another, and hewn square shaped stones (Callaway 1970: 14). Floor areas behind the two rows of pillars were some? times paved in part with cobblestone while the central area was usually of beaten earth. Varia? tions existed in room number, size, and orienta? tion as well as the numbers of pillars. The central elongated area, at times designated as an open "courtyard," perhaps was uncovered while one or both adjacent parallel rooms were roofed (fig. 3). Some structures, especially those of a later date, preserve stone steps implying the former presence of a second floor, possibly ex-</page><page sequence="82">74 GLORIA LONDON KM^J Fig. 3 Layout of Early Iron I structures at Tell Masos reconstructed with open, unroofed center courtyards. tending over a roofed courtyard as well as the sur? rounding rooms (Mazar 1990a: 485). The presence of pillars, stone steps, and thick walls (0.60-1.0 m), has been considered evidence of not only a roof, but also a second floor (Stager 1985: 17). At cUmayri, both the depth ofthe destruction debris (0.70-2.0 m) inside Building B (fig. 4) and the thick wall 2.0 m in height, led the excavators to assume that a second story once existed, despite the absence of stairs. The roof and floor of the upper room were composed of organic materials and mud, which covered at least part if not the entire building (Clark 2002:94,97). Inside, mend- able pottery of over forty collared rim store jars was found in an overturned position, possibly fallen from an upstairs (Clark 2002: 97) or from raised shelves. The weight of so many storage jars would have required a substantial floor capable of supporting a considerable load. DESIGN OF THE FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES Evidence that the smaller buildings elsewhere carried a second floor is less convincing. An up? per story, even for the smallest buildings, has been inferred from wall width, occasional stone stairs, pillars, as well as overall design, small size, and open nature ofthe lower floor plan. Following most scholars who have considered the building layout, Holladay assumed that the overall design and small dimensions practically required a second floor if</page><page sequence="83">FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES AT HILL COUNTRY WORKSTATIONS 75 Xl/ ~^5^ HhondanoofUeoOO Fig. 4 Reconstruction ofthe Tall al-c Umayri pillared four- room building. Drawing by Rhonda Root. (Reproduced by permission ofthe Madaba Plains Project-l Umayri.) people were to have lived there (1999: 389). In contrast, at Bethel and Tell Beit Mirsim, "the Isra? elite family ... lived in the ground floor as a rule instead of using the ground floor for storerooms" (Albright 1949: 119). Hopkins concluded that the structures were "strikingly small," with roofed space at a premium and room for not more than three or four occupants (1987: 182). At Tell el- Farcah (N) house interior area of 100 square meters (Bloch-Smith and Nakhai 1999: 71) was compa? rable to Building B at cUmayri measuring about 90.5 square meters (fig. 5). From the limited house size, Hopkins (1988: 2, 4-5) extrapolated that families were small and mortality was high. With space allotted for seasonal animal pro? tection, work (such as cooking) and storage, little room remained for human habitation on the ground floor. Internally, minimal architectural features characterized the use of space, except for two rows of pillars or post bases designed to support a roof, but not necessarily a second floor. In contrast to solid interior walls, the pillars would have afforded unhindered access to the covered side rooms (Routledge 2000: 54), especially for people at work or highly domesticated animals. Iron II comparable four-room constructions, in which stone lintels have been preserved between the pillars, indicated that the passageways between the pillars were low, and better suited to use by animals than humans (Callaway 1970:15; Mazar 1990a: 485). Over low- hanging lintels found at cAi, a roof beam 1.60 m above floor level implies that the ceiling would have been 1.85 m or more above the floor height. Lintels were found in situ, some with stones above them, in structures at Khirbet el-Mudayna el- cAliya. Late Iron I pillared houses there displayed walls 0.60-0.80 m thick and monolithic pillars 1.40 and 1.70 m high (Routledge 2000:49-54). For the remote site of el-Mudayna in the eastern highlands of Jordan, Routledge (2000: 54) interpreted the pillars as providing entry to the side rooms, which themselves had some type of superstructure above the pillars, thereby creating more reasonable roof heights than would be afforded by the height of the extant pillars and lintels alone. Rubble screen walls of field stones piled between pillars at c Ai (Callaway 1970: 14) could have been made of skins or cloths hung as a removable covering to separate the two side rooms from the center area. If the pillars did not support a second story, they could have minimized the distance required for logs to span in order to create a roof. Covered areas, especially if limited to the rear and side rooms, would have been easier to span with the aid ofthe pillars. A shorter distance from the out- ermost walls to the internal "wall" created by the pillars meant the builders could work with short logs. Alternatively, at cAi, the logs would have spanned 3.0 m of roofed area (Callaway 1970:14) and twice that length at cUmayri (Clark 2002: 57). Stairs need not imply a second story since they could have led either to a second floor, or a flat roof. While one indicator of a second floor could be wall thickness, the substantial walls might sim? ply have been an earthquake precaution or, as David Hopkins suggests, an example of overbuild- ing wall thickness, which the ancients often did for buildings andboats (personal communication). Destructions due to earthquakes occurred in the region, precisely in the LB II and following tran? sitional era as noted at Deir cAlla (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 31) and cUmayri where Clark (2002: 55) theorized that an earthquake was a cata- lyst for the massive Iron I defense system. In ad? dition, overly thick walls at cUmayri might have</page><page sequence="84">76 GLORIA LONDON Fig. 5 Tall al-' Umayri four-room pillared building in Field B. The large trapezoidal form had interior measurements of 6.0-8.0 m wide and 12.5-13.0 m on the long sides. (Reproduced by permission ofthe Madaba Plains Project-f Umayri.) compensated for the lack of a foundation trench, which was also missing for the Giloh structure built on uneven bedrock (Mazar 1982b: 168). If the four-room structures were not large enough to accommodate the workforce and/or families all year, they might have been intention- ally small to lodge a limited year-round popula? tion responsible for the fieldwork. Rather than four-room houses, I propose that they were stor? age facilities, workstations, or depots for tools, produce, and the small group of people delegated to work there. At larger sites, especially later in the Iron I and II, the design of four-room struc? tures was modified, enlarged and remodeled into more suitable dwellings. Limited covered space in the stone structures designed to withstand the cold, wet winters sug? gests that only a small percentage of the popula? tion lived year round at the hill country work sites. Some ofthe larger constructions could have had a second floor, but not all, especially not the small- est. It is equally feasible that a flat roof covered part of one-story buildings, since the pillars, thick walls, and stone steps have been explained as es- sential elements of such a roof and are not neces- sarily a compelling argument for two floors. Use ofthe side rooms as shelter for animals normally penned up outside left little room for humans. The meager covered areas imply a small residential population year round, in contrast to the abundance of ground stone equipment and utilitarian pottery, which are far in excess of the number of people resident at the site year round. TERRACE FARMING AND HUMAN RESOURCES I have proposed here that hill country sites were normally used by a small slice ofthe popula? tion to accommodate best the restraints imposed by terrace farming. Difficulties in full time living at the hill country sites arose from the uncertain-</page><page sequence="85">FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES AT HILL COUNTRY WORKSTATIONS 77 ties of food production. These unknowns stemmed, in part, from the vagaries of precipitation in the region. Given the agricultural insecurity, Hopkins (1987: 187-89) suggested that such risks were ameliorated by managed labor using a staggered pattern of sowing wheat and barley and by the uti? lization of various environmental niches in the highly diversified landscape. Based on my 1979 interviews with Gershon Edelstein and Palestin? ian farmers in terraced fields north of Jerusalem, individual terraced strips often have space suffi? cient to accommodate one person only, possibly working with an animal to plow the field. Whereas one farmer and one ox were sufficient to plow, hoe, sow and weed, and prune, considerably more people were needed to pick and process olives or grapes, and harvest, thresh, and winnow summer grains. Four distinct stages were necessary to create a viable system of terrace farming: 1) soil procure- ment and wall construction; 2) regular maintenance of the wall along with chores related to planting, fertilizing (with manure) and weeding; 3) harvest activities; and 4) food processing, cooking and preserving. Maintaining agricultural terraces re? quired a small but diligent labor force. Terraced fields left unattended for a season suffered from erosion in times of heavy rainfall. The third and fourth stages ofthe work, harvesting and food pro? cessing, required a larger and different group of workers with specific skills and knowledge of pre? serving food. If year-round residents in the hill country sites were restricted to the few needed to manage the fields, the community could have in? creased significantly at harvest time. In the recent past in northern Jordan and Pal? estine, extra hands were needed in the spring and summer to help harvest winter grains and legumes, which were important sources of food for people and animals (Palmer 1998: 135). During the sum? mer, tree and shrub fruit such as grapes, figs, and pomegranates ripen. In northern Jordan, villagers moved into their orchards to collect and protect the fruits (Palmer 1998: 157) as was done by vil? lagers in Palestine during the summer months (Amiry and Tamari 1989: 39). Last to be harvested were olives?green olives in late September and black olives in November. Males from Palestin- ian villages made molasses (Amiry and Tamari 1989: 39) and women processed other sweets. Similarly in antiquity, after the rainy season, when harvest work required additional hands, the work- station population swelled to include individuals who wintered elsewhere. SUMMER HARVEST AND SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS During the spring, summer and early autumn, the human and animal populations in the hill coun? try could have been expanded to provide help in the fields and with food processing tasks. Yet their remains would largely have been invisible except for the disproportionally large quantity of ground stone and utilitarian ceramics. An excess of ground-stone equipment hardly suited the small interior space of the buildings unless the small four-room structures sufficed for a residential com? munity that varied seasonally with a peak popula? tion during the summer months. Rather than func- tioning as a four-room house year-round, especially in the early days, it was primarily a storage facil- ity or workstation with tools for a handful of resi- dent workers. In the summer months, the extra workforce could have slept out of doors, near the fields, or on rooftops. Flat rooftops, reached by stone steps or perishable wooden ladders (Mazar 1990a: 485), would have provided ideal accom- modations, without a trace remaining. Following summertime subsistence work, fairs at centrally located holy sites could have been the venue of religious feasts with important social obligations. Afterwards most of the people returned to their larger permanent villages in Jordan, the Negev, or in the lowlands, where they had four-room houses stocked with a familiar material culture. RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY AND ENLARGED SOCIAL NETWORKS Developments in the social landscape indica- tive ofa new way of life eventually encompassed politics and religion. Isolation, dispersion, and small population size at the proposed workstations made new social networks mandatory to assure adequate food supplies, and access to a sufficiently large gene pool to ensure future generations. A</page><page sequence="86">78 GLORIA LONDON young healthy population in residence at the work- stations would have left few burial deposits. Simi? larly, small sacred sites, where fairs, food, and the opportunity to discharge a myriad of social obli- gations existed, have remained largely undetec- ted. The collapse of elements within the Late Bronze Age society culminated in the displace- ment of people and the disruption of associated social conventions and customs. New social and economic relationships have been detected in the archaeological remains and artifact distribution, which covered a wider geographic region than previously, with less dependence on the coastal strip and more connections reaching eastward to Transjordan. Tribal entities that embraced both sedentary and non-sedentary people, agricultural- ists and pastoralists, could have provided the en- abling mechanism for a fluid population to pre- vail despite the shifts in settlement patterns and creation of new social and economic alliances (LaBianca and Younker 1995: 403-5). Herr documented evidence of the new net? works based on parallels between ceramics exca? vated at cUmayri and the Judaean Hills, especially that of Mt. Ebal Stratum II (1999: 70*; 2000:281). Similarities in potter's marks incised in the wet clay on collared rim store jar handles found at Mt. Ebal and cUmayri attest to possible connections (Herr 1999: 70*). Parallels to the collared rim jars excavated at cUmayri (fig. 6) are known from Deir cAlla, Giloh, cIzbet Sartah, Shechem, Shiloh, and cAi (Herr 2002: 140 and figs. 4.17-27). Some of the collared rim jars found at cUmayri were made of clays locally available and there were multiple ways to manufacture the jars (London 1999: 82- 6). In addition to similar shapes found at cUmayri and in the central hills of Israel/Palestine, is con- sistency in the assemblage composition, which emphasized utilitarian forms. In the cUmayri Early Iron I deposits in Fields A, B, and F, which in? cluded houses and other structures, seventy-five percent of the ceramics were utilitarian compa? rable to eighty percent at the Giloh workstation (Mazar 1982b: 170). Ties to the Mediterranean coastal region and Negev were negligible (Herr 2000: 281; 2002: 146). If the initial year-round population at the work? stations was minimal, the rest of the population could have found good pasture and conditions suit? able for winter fruit trees and cereals in the areas north and south of Amman where the annual mini? mum rainfall is 200 mm (LaBianca and Younker 1995:403). Following the harvest and related food processing, people once again dispersed from cen? tral Israel/Palestine to return to their winter homes east ofthe Jordan River as at Tell el-cUmayri, or around Tell Deir cAlla; others possibly trekked south, to the Negev site of Tell Masos. Tell Deir cAlia, situated at an open and well-watered posi? tion in the Jordan Valley, dominated the approaches to and from the Wadi Zerqa. In former times, the Zerqa flowed in a riverbed directly north of the tell and created suitable conditions for winter crops (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 5). Tell el-cUmayri stood adjacent to one ofthe few springs in the re? gion. Links to a wider geographic region were nec? essary given the use ofa more agriculturally mar- ginal, less productive and less predictable hill country in a semi-arid environment unlike condi? tions in the lowlands (Bunimovitz 1995: 327). People expanded their social and economic net? work and engaged in a high degree of residential mobility encompassing the hill country and Transjordan and perhaps the well-watered twenty- acres site at Tel Masos. In Central Jordan, LB IB- IIA settlement debris is sparse, although there were cemeteries, isolated sanctuaries and burials at Tell Safiit, Umm ad-Dananir, plus the Baqcah Valley burial caves north of Amman (Younker 1999:194). On the contrary, at least twenty habitation sites in Ammon are designated as transitional LB/Iron I Age, including cUmayri, Sahab, Jawa, Khirbet Othman, Jebel et-Teweim, El-Mabrak, Khirbet el- Edhmah, Rujm Beider, and Khilda (LaBianca and Younker 1995: 407; Younker 1999: 195). On the central Transjordanian plateau, sites range from sherd scatters to stratified tells, as at cUmayri, with LB II, LB/Iron, and Iron I Age deposits (Herr et al. 2001). Neither a break with the urbanized Late Bronze Age nor a regression to a semi-peripatetic existence characterized the transitional LB/Iron I.</page><page sequence="87">FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES AT HILL COUNTRY WORKSTATIONS 79 /*" \*i \ i \ \...... I \ J 0 10 Fig. 6 Collared rim storage jars from Tall al-c Umayri. (Reproduced from MPP-c Umayri 5 by permission ofthe Madaba Plains Project-c Umayri.) The lifestyle and distribution of sites minimized risk and maximized the unique environmental di? versity ofthe region as a whole. Similarly, nine- teenth and twentieth century residents dissected the region in search of water, fodder, and suitable habitats for themselves and their animals (van der Steen 1995,1996,1999; Bienkowski and van deer Steen 2001). The Jordan Valley seems to have operated as a conduit for access to different envi? ronmental niches rather than as a political or geo? graphical barrier. SITE DIFFERENTIATION: FOUR CATEGORIES OF CONTEMPORANEOUS SITES One discrepancy between the hill country workstations and the larger settlement sites was their function, as reflected in artifact diversity. Transitional LB/Iron I sites apparently were highly differentiated in their location, function, assem? blages and population despite certain overlaps. I propose that four types of sites co-existed and were utilized by the same individuals. At settlement sites such as cUmayri the full range of daily activities occurred. Unlike the hill country workstations, cUmayri stood as a walled settlement adjacent to a spring, and has been described as a "richer more advanced" site than those west ofthe Jordan River (Herr 1999: 70*). It featured ample storage facili? ties with forty or more collared rim storage jars excavated from one room in Building B (Clark 2002: 55). With a large array of artifacts and four- room structures, cUmayri appears to have been a permanent settlement with a full spectrum of the population who had connections to the worksta- tions. Women, along with old and young people, who might not have regularly participated in the annual sojourn to the central hill region of Israel/ Palestine, resided year round at cUmayri. Artifacts traditionally associated with women, such as loom weights, spindle whorls, and household fertility shrines of humans and animals were found at cUmayri (Clark 1997; 2002: 97). Such artifacts were consistently absent at the workstations. Hu? man skeletal remains of two adults, one likely male and one juvenile aged 15, along with fragments of a child, came from the four-room structure at cUmayri (Chase 2002: 220). Faunal debris in a garbage dump in a big pit associated with the house and adjacent structure contained over 25,000 bone fragments. Ofthe 5,989 bones examined, seventy- two percent were identifiable of which eighty-five percent belonged to sheep and goat plus additional domestic and wild mammals, birds and fish (Pe- ters et al. 2002: 306). Included was Nile Perch</page><page sequence="88">80 GLORIA LONDON thought to have been brought from Egypt in a pre? served state (salted, sun dried, smoked or some type of combination; Peters et al. 2002: 329). Sheep for wool production, goats for milk, and cattle for traction power imply the importance of stock rearing (Peters et al. 2002: 330) and a spec? trum of activities for men, women and children. Another core settlement was possibly at Tel Masos where an unusual assemblage of Mediter? ranean, local and southern pottery, along with three and four-room houses (Fritz 1987: 95) was found. Positioned on a trade route that connected the Aravah, Transjordan, central hills and the coast (Mazar 1990a: 336) and likely surrounded by ephemeral winter sites, Masos was a link too com? plex to define here. Large sites were the excep? tion, given the lack of sufficient water resources in both the Negev and Transjordan. Temporary sites, encampments, caves and sea? sonal accommodations both around Masos and cUmayri could account for the small four-room structures and specialized uses of LB/Iron Age sites, some as workstations and others for sacred purposes. A second category of sites, here designated as workstations, were the small locations hidden in the central hills of Israel/Palestine. They served as the temporary homes for a small segment ofthe community among whom activities were limited, as was the associated artifact assemblage. Given the initial unpredictability of terraced farming, the result could have been "demographically unstable villages composed of small and demographically unstable households" leading to the eventual aban? donment of many small sites (Hopkins: 1988: 6- 7). Hopkins described the process of agricultural intensification "as a gradual one that took an ex? tremely uneven course" (1987: 190). Semi-de- stroyed fields and their associated structures could have been abandoned rather than rebuild the ter? raced slope. In contrast, well-maintained worksta? tions might have grown into settlements eventu? ally as people adopted a more sedentary lifestyle in Israel/Palestine. Burials and cemeteries constituted a third type of site. Cave and bench tombs, types known from LB II Canaan, have been described as the exclu? sive types of Iron I Age burial deposits (Bloch- Smith 1992: 167-77). Burial sites, in Judaea and Samaria, traditionally dated to the LB II and lack? ing nearby occupational, include caves and other types of largely multiple burials containing deco? rated and other LB II-III wares, existed at Dothan, Tacanach, Shechem, Hebron, Jedur and Gibeon. Kletter (2002: 33-35) acknowledged similarities between LB II and Iron I Age pottery, as well as difficulties in dating deposits to either period, yet he ascribed tomb deposits to the LB II and opted for a near absence of Iron I Age tombs. He re- jected the idea that the Tell Dothan cemetery be? longed to a non-sedentary people ofthe thirteenth century Late Bronze Age as suggested by Hess (1993: 136-37). The dating of painted wares in multiple burials is complicated by the practice of curating decorated artifacts for decades prior to their deposition as a mortuary offering. As a con- sequence, pottery considered typical of LB II could well have been placed into LB/Iron I funerary de? posits. A dearth of luxury items at the workstations implies that decorated pottery was kept elsewhere and/or possibly relegated to one ofthe cemeteries and burial caves, especially at those sites for which little or no settlement debris is known. For ex? ample, at the remote site of Tell Jedur, ten kilome? ters north of Hebron, no settlement deposit of LB II date was identified, but cave deposits dated to the mid-fourteenth to the end ofthe thirteenth cen? tury include two hundred bowls of both local and imported types as well as metal artifacts and a rare bowl originating in the northwestern corner of Saudi Arabia (Gonen 1992: 66). Instead of booty from a raiding party attack against a coastal people (Gonen 1992: 67), it could represent a transitional LB/Iron I era deposit. At Safed, a Wadi Hamra a tomb with 290 pots was not associated with a settlement (Gonen 1992: 53). At Khirbet Rabud, thirteen kilometers southwest of Hebron, seventy- five percent of nearly one hundred illicitly exca? vated tombs had Late Bronze Age artifacts. Settle? ment debris at Rabud was dated to the Late Bronze and transitional LB/Iron Age (Kochavi 1974: 12 19). At Dothan, a tomb with local and imported pots, metals, scarabs and bone artifacts (Free 1960: 10-14) totaling 3140 objects along with a mini? mum of three hundred skeletons contrasted sharply</page><page sequence="89">FOUR-ROOM STRUCTURES AT HILL COUNTRY WORKSTATIONS 81 with the meager Late Bronze II habitation debris at the site. The stratified Dothan tomb deposit has been dated to the LB II, LB III (1300-1200 b.ce.) and Early Iron Age (Gonen 1992: 133). A fourth category of LB/Iron Age site pertains to sacred space. Pilgrimage sites and shrines at small Iron I Age sites contrast with Late Bronze Age temples (Nakhai 2001: 203) and the same could have characterized the transitional LB/Iron I Age. A thirteenth century sanctuary complex at Tell Deir c Alia possibly served as a regional sanc? tuary given the array of imports (Franken and Kalsbeek 1969: 19-20; Franken 1992). Thebulls' head bowl at Raddanah (Callaway and Cooley 1971: 18) was perhaps of cultic significance, as was the bronze figurine at the "Bull Site," which is an open cult site including a 21-23 m circle of stones, a possible "standing stone" and part of a ceramic cult object (Mazar 1982a: 33-4). The pro? posed Shiloh sanctuary complex occupied much ofthe site (Finkelstein 1988: 220-34; 291). Inter? pretation ofthe Mt. Ebal main structure as an al- tar (Zertal 1986-87: 113-18) is still debated (Nakhai 2001: 197-98 n. 29). CONCLUSION The proposed workstations belonged to a larger social landscape stretching between the cen? tral hill country of Israel/Palestine and the central plateau of Jordan. They were storage depots rather than permanent homes given the small four-room buildings, minimal habitation space, andrestricted artifact assemblage. Year-round residents were few in number and concentrated on terrace mainte? nance. For summer harvesting, the workstation community increased temporarily. Similarities in artifact assemblages have demonstrated a paral- lelism spreading east and west ofthe Jordan River and attest to the strength of the transitional LB/ Iron I Age society. Archaeological data of hill coun? try farmers and their larger social community sug? gest that social bonds reverberated among a widely dispersed people whose ties with the Late Bronze Age were enduring.

Mabry For generations, some archaeologists have interpreted the female figurines commonly found at Near Eastern Neolithic sites as fertility fetishes or representations of "mother goddesses. " An alternate interpretation is that they reflect another aspect ofthe ancestor veneration at? tested by special treatments of skulls and other archaeological evidence. Based on ethno? graphic patterns, I argue that Neolithic human figurines were depictions of recently deceased members of each household. These recent ancestors were treated as elders with continuing roles, and their presence symbolized the continuities of lineages and legitimized claims to heritable propteries. Most human figurines depictedfemales because women usually conducted householdproperties and ancestor rituals, and because male ancestors were honored in other ways in public rituals. The making of human images in the Near East began about 12,000 b.p. (uncalibrated radiocarbon years before present) during the Natufian period in the southern Levant, when groups of intensive plant collectors were living in sedentary settlements prior to the domestication of plants and the development of agriculture. Less numerous than representations of animals in stone, bone, and horn, Natufian human images include a few small, schematic limestone sculptures of hu? man heads and possibly a copulating couple (Cauvin 1978: 118, figs. 22-23; Bienert 1995: 77, figs. 4-5; Bar-Yosef 1998: 166, fig. 7). Portable images of humans and animals became more im? portant in the Near East after the development of agriculture about 10,500 b.p., as indicated by the often numerous anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines found at most excavated Neolithic sites in the Levant and Anatolia (Table 1). The distribution of Neolithic figurines in Southwest Asia extends to early farming village sites in the Zagros uplands (Voigt 1983; Broman Morales 1983,1990;Negahban 1984;Eygun 1992) and the foothills and lowlands of upper Mesopotamia (Mallowan and Rose 1935; Speiser 1935; Mallowan 1936; Lloyd and Safar 1945; Tobler 1950; Dales 1960; Oates 1966, 1969; Merpert and Munchaev 1973; Akira 1980; Lohof 1989; Ippolitoni Strika 1998). Except for the up? per Mesopotamian lowlands, which were not oc? cupied during the early Neolithic, ceramic figu? rines appear in the archaeological records of these regions even before pottery. 85</page><page sequence="94">86 JONATHAN B. MABRY Some Near Eastern Neolithic figurines are made from stone, bone or plaster, but most are made of clay, either unbaked or fired. Their ar? chaeological contexts are generally mundane. Occasionally they are found intact in contexts in? terpreted as ritual-related, but they mostly occur in domestic trash deposits in a broken condition. Most ofthe animal figurines depict aurochs (wild cattle), but birds, ibexes, sheep or goats, felines, and possibly equids, pigs, bears and canids are also portrayed. Among the human figurines are a few examples of males and hermaphrodites, and many of undesignated gender. However, the great ma? jority of those that have gender-specific attributes depict females. For generations, Near Eastern archaeologists have been intrigued by these images, and have asked, Who are these female persons portrayed in such abundance at early farming villages? Who made these images? How were they used? What was their meaning? Proposed here is a hypothesis in which anthropomorphic figurines at Near East? ern Neolithic sites are interpreted as representa- tions of recent, mostly female ancestors made and used by women in domestic settings in rituals to communicate with their forebears. The interpretation of Near Eastern Neolithic figurines as representations of ancestors has been proposed previously in detail only by Pearson (1999: 163-64), who based his argument on just a few ofthe archaeological patterns and associations described below. The model presented here also takes its inspiration from similar interpretations of figurine meanings and uses in early farming villages in highland Mesoamerica (Marcus 1998), southwestern North America (Stinson 2003), east? ern Asia (Chang 1983), and one of several inter? pretations considered for Neolithic figurines in Greece (Talalay 1991). Developing a similar hypothesis, it is sug? gested here that most figurines depicting humans found at early farming villages in the Near East represented ancestors rather than fertility fetishes, goddess idols, or the other meanings that have been assumed or proposed (see below). This interpre? tation is based upon correlations among a number of patterns, including 1) the archaeological con? texts, artifact associations, imagery and treatment of human figurines; 2) human representations in other scales and media; 3) social and ideological changes common in neolithic/formative societies around the world; and 4) uses of human figurines in ancestor veneration rituals in historical and con? temporary societies. In the concluding section, I place the meaning of Neolithic human figurines as ancestor representations in the context of other types of evidence of symbolic systems in early farming villages in the Near East. PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS Two common interpretations of the meaning ofNear Eastern Neolithic figurines depicting fe- males are that they were fertility fetishes or charms used in rituals of sympathetic magic to increase the likelihood of pregnancy (Stekelis 1972: 27; Noy 1986: 66; Rollefson 1986: 37) and birthing charms meant to protect the health of mothers dur? ing childbirth (Rollefson 2000: 167-68); or that they were representations of "mother goddesses" (or even a single Mother Goddess) whose wor? ship ensured the fecundity of people, crops, and livestock (Kenyon 1957: 59-60; 1970: 33; Mellaart 1967, 1970; Cauvin 1972, 1994, 2000a, 2000b; Stekelis 1972:27; Gimbutas 1989; Mellaart etal. 1989; Hodder 1990). In addition to the femaleness of these figu? rines, signaled by modeled breasts and/or vulvae, these interpretations also refer to other body char? acteristics, postures, gestures and degrees of schematization and standardization. Fat folds and large buttocks and thighs portraying obesity or ste- atopygia (an extreme accumulation of fat on the buttocks and thighs) have been viewed as signify- ing fertility (Mellaart 1970; Yeivin and Mozel 1977). Open-legged, seated, bent and crouched positions are generally seen as birth postures (Mellaart 1967: pls. 67, 68, IX; Noy 1986: 64; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 204). The holding of breasts with hands is viewed as symbolizing fertility (Kenyon 1957: 59) or identifying divine status (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b: 13) in the manner of historical goddesses of fertility (cf Pritchard 1943: 42-49). Highly schematized faces and standard? ized forms are viewed as representing deperson- alized deities (Cauvin 2000a: 105).</page><page sequence="95">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 87 Table 1.

TOTALS 181 &gt;1,238? 4</page><page sequence="96">88 JONATHAN B. MABRY Late Neolithic examples of female figures seated on stools or thrones are thought to repre? sent the development of the concept of a creator goddess who was the divine source of all life and associated with increase, abundance and fertility in agriculture and stock herding, and therefore civi? lization in general (Mellaart 1967,1970; Gimbutas 1989; Cauvin 2000a). Animal figurines depicting bulls, rams, stags, lions and panthers are seen as representing a complementary masculine principle of virility, and also the opposing "wildness" of untamed nature (Mellaart 1967: 101, 181, 202; Cauvin 2000a: 31 and passim). Along this line of reasoning, male figures seated on bulls and females seated on leopards represent how the "divine couple" controlled and civilized the wild and dan- gerous forces in nature (Mellaart 1967: 181, 201; Hodder 1990: 11; Cauvin 2000a: 124-25). Inthis interpretation is explained the origins ofthe male- dominated pantheons of the historical Near East, with the bull-god eventually humanized and evolv- ing into Baal ofthe Phoenicians and Hadad ofthe Hittites, male deities being depicted riding bulls or in the form of bulls, and the dominance ofthe Mother Goddess fading and her role reducing to wife or consort of the male deity (Cauvin 2000a: 124-25). Other, less common interpretations of Neolithic anthropomorphic figurines in the Near East include children's toys (see discussion in Ucko 1968: 421-23); "vehicles of magic" used to ensure the well-being of women and children (Voigt 2000: 267, 269); "magic wish-figures" (Broman-Morales 1990: 58,64); teaching devices used during initiation rites (Talalay 1984: 262); amulets used as protection from evil (Stekelis 1972: 27); fetishes used by shamans (Rollefson 2000: 187); combined representations of male and female genitalia used in fertility and purification rituals (Gopher and Orrelle 1996: 255); represen? tations of ancestors (Meskell 1998: 59; Pearson 1999: 161-64); depictions of deified ancestors serving as emblems of group identity (Miller 2002: 232); representations of womanhood in general (Broman Morales 1990: 19; Hamilton 1996: 225; Voigt 2000: 288); and portraits of individuals (McAdaml997: 138). Most of these interpretations of figurine mean? ings have been purely intuitive. Only a few stud? ies of Near Eastern figurines have carefully ana? lyzed variation in their archaeological contexts (e.g.,Hamilton 1996;McAdam 1997; Voigt 2000; Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel 2002), or offered in? terpretations that refer to comparative ethno- graphic data (e.g., Ucko 1968; Voigt 2000; Miller 2002; see also Voigt 1983 and Talalay 1993 for applications of ethnographic analogies to Neolithic figurines from neighboring regions). Explanations in terms of Neolithic social and ritual contexts are equally rare. Based on their ubiquity in domestic refuse, Rollefson (2000) suggests that PPNB figu? rines atc Ain Ghazal were talismans used by indi? viduals to access personally the spirit world, within rituals at the base of a hierarchy of individual, household and community ritual behavior. Gopher and Orrelle (1996) attribute frequent figurine use at Yarmukian villages to heightened ritualism dur? ing a period of social stress. Compared to studies of formative period figu? rines in the New World, these interpretive ap? proaches are not well grounded in models of Neolithic social organization and ritual life. Spe? cifically, the meanings ofNear Eastern Neolithic figurines have not been considered in the context of development of the household as the basic so? cial and economic unit, the lineage as the unit of property ownership and inheritance, a division between public and private social life and ritual? ism, and a dichotomy between women's and men's rituals?important social changes that commonly occurred during transitions to agricultural depen- dence, sedentism and village organization around the world. The analytical concern here is with the meanings of Neolithic figurines in the Levant and Anatolia as these symbols were socially derived and embedded?that is, how meanings were re? lated to who made them, where and how they were used in ritual actions, and how the ritual spheres they operated within reflect new ideological and social structures emerging during the Neolithic transition. Published references for figurines from discussed sites are cited in Table 1.

FIGURINE VARIABILITY, PATTERNS, AND RARITIES In this section are summarized the known ar? chaeological contexts, associations with other ma? terial culture, treatments after use and aspects of representation within and among assemblages of human figurines at the Near Eastern Neolithic sites listed in Table 1. Patterns expressed in numbers or proportions of assemblages are hampered by differing descriptive categories and inconsistent reporting of attribute frequencies, so the observa? tions here are necessarily at general and sometimes anecdotal levels. This means that additional pat? terns and trends are probably masked. Neverthe- less, a number of general patterns, unusual outli- ers, regional differences and changes over time can be identified. Contexts Near Eastern Neolithic human figurines have typically been found discarded in general domes? tic trash, including household refuse accumulated in middens, courtyards, spaces between buildings, outdoor pits and houses (Mellaart 1970:166; Voigt 1985: 16; 2000: 265; Broman Morales 1990: 57, 71; Garfinkel 1995: 54; Hamilton 1996: 217-19; McAdam 1997: 136; Meskell 1998: 59; Ben- Shlomo and Garfinkel 2002:209-12; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 190; Miller 2002: 224). However, hu? man figurines have also been found where they were deliberately placed, usually inside houses. These domestic, in situ contexts include beneath or within house walls (Mellaart 1967: 78, 180; Hamilton 1996: 217-19; McAdam 1997: 136); in wall niches (Mellaart 1970: 175); on thresholds (Hamilton 1996: 218); on floors (Mellaart 1970: 166; Noy 1989: 13; Broman Morales 1990: 57; Collet 1996: 403; Hamilton 1996: 217-19); in or near hearths (Mellaart 1970: 167; Hamilton 1996: 218); in concavities in floors (Cauvin et al. 1999: 94); and in grain bins (Mellaart 1970: 167; Hamilton 1996: 218). They have also been found on floors where they had possibly fallen from wall niches or shelves (Mellaart 1970: 175; Noy 1989: 13; Hamilton 1996: 218). In addition to these typical domestic extramu- ral and intramural contexts, occasionally they have been found in situ in places identified as outdoor shrines (Schmandt-Besserat 1998a) and cached in outdoor pits (Mellaart 1967: 180; Hamilton 1996: 217; McAdam 1997: 136; Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel 2002: 211). They are not commonly found in graves (the only reported exception known to this author is Simmons et al. 2001: 27).</page><page sequence="98">90 JONATHAN B. MABRY A frequently noted pattern is that, at sites with buildings interpreted as having ritual functions, anthropomorphic figurines are not associated with those buildings (Broman-Morales 1990: 71; Hauptmann 1999: 77; Ozdogan 1999: 59). Aclear exception is Hoyticek, where sets of female figu? rines were found in the buildings of the Shrine Phase and on a plastered platform of the follow? ing Sanctuaries Phase (Duru 1999: 178). Another possible exception is ?atal Hoyiik (Mellaart 1967: 178-203), but some researchers have suggested that Mellaart's distinctions between "shrines" and "houses" are arbitrary (Hamilton 1996: 218-19, 226-27; Last 1998: 365-72; Voigt 2000: 282). Associations The best information on associations of hu? man figurines with other figurines and other types of objects is from sites with large assemblages and detailed descriptions. At such sites, human figu? rines have been found in pairs and larger groups (Mellaart 1970: 175; Voigt 1985: 16; 2000: 265; Hamilton 1996: 223-24; McAdam 1997: 136; Cauvin et al. 1999: 94; Duru 1999: 178), with larger representations ("statues" or "statuettes") of humans (Rollefson 1986: 47; McAdam 1997: 137), with animal figurines?mostly of aurochs, and often bulls (Voigt 1985: 16; Hamilton 1996: 217, 224; McAdam 1997: 136-37), with shape- less lumps of clay (Voigt 2000: 265), with bars of unbaked clay (Mellaart 1970: 175), with assorted pottery vessels and stone chisels (Duru 1999:178) and with caches of food, weapons and utilitarian objects (Hamilton 1996: 218-19). The association with bull figurines is pro? nounced at cAin Ghazal, where two human figu? rines were found near a cache of twenty-five pre- dominately bull figurines (McAdam 1997: 137) and at Qatal Hoyiik, where some figurines depict persons (male whenever gender is clearly indi? cated) riding bulls (Hamilton 1996: 225). At the latter site, other figurines depict persons (often women) seated upon leopards, and with hands holding or resting on leopards (Hamilton 1996: 224). These associations were not coincidental, but rather imply that the meanings of human figurines worked in conjunction with the symbolisms of these other objects. However, at many other sites the meanings of figurines worked autonomously. For example, the fact that every human figurine from the excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan was found alone?that is, not in groups of two or more?in? dicates that they were used one at a time (Miller 2002: 225). Treatments Garfinkel (1995: 17,53) argues that Neolithic ceramic figurines are typically found in a broken state because they are inherently fragile. However, in many assemblages the majority of human figu? rines appear to have been deliberately broken? usually by snapping off the head (Collet 1996:403; Hamilton 1996: 220; McAdam 1997: 138). The faces of some figurines at c Ain Ghazal appear to have been scraped away (Rollefson 1986: 47; McAdam 1997: 138). Some human figurines were deliberately bur? ied in pits (Mellaart 1967: 180; Hamilton 1996: 217; McAdam 1997: 136; Ben-Shlomo and Garfinkel 2002: 211). At cAin Ghazal a small, de- faced clay figurine was buried with a set of large, broken plaster statues and busts in a pit dug into the floor of an abandoned house (Rollefson 1986: 47). Garfinkel (1994) interprets this treatment as ritual disposal of broken or worn-out cultic ob? jects, and, indeed, buried human figurines are usu? ally fragments or sets of fragments. At ?atal Hoyiik, a broken-off figurine head was buried with its body above a hearth at the time of abandon? ment ofa building (Hamilton 1996: 219). Additional treatments include destruction by fire, sometimes combined with burial. At Gritille Hoyiik, some human figurines were placed in roast- ing pits and burned, and then the pits were sealed beneath a cobble floor (Voigt 1985:16; 2000:265). At ?atal Hoyiik, a number of human figurines were possibly placed in houses that were then deliber? ately burned (Hamilton 1996: 219). Representations ofGender and Age Large portions of many assemblages are figu? rines of undepicted or ambiguous gender, but in most assemblages the majority ofthe gender-spe- cific representations have female features.

MABRY example, ofthe twenty figurines from c Ain Ghazal that could be assigned to gender, eighty-five per? cent were female (McAdam 1997: 119), nine out of the ten PPNB figurines at Munhatta that had clear depictions of gender were female (Garfinkel 1995:15), all twenty-nine ofthe cowrie-eyed figu? rines from the Yarmukian stratum at this site were female representations (1995: 36), all but one of the seventy-four cowrie-eyed figurines from Sha'ar Hagolan are female representations (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 206) and all ofthe nearly one hundred human figurines from Hoyiicek are female (Duru 1999: 178-79). A striking exception is Nevah ?ori, where male and female figurines are about equal in number (Hauptmann 1999: 77). At some sites, the female figurines mostly depict mature women (Hamilton 1996: 225-26; Miller 2002: 228). In many assemblages, the em? phasis in female representations appears to be on characteristics signifying maturity rather than re- production; fat folds and enlarged lower bodies are emphasized more than breasts or vulvae. Ex? ceptions include female figurines with exagger? ated breasts from Tell Aswad layers II-III (de Contenson 1983, figs. 7,9),c Ain Ghazal (McAdam 1997: fig. 2) and female figurines from Hoyiicek and Tell Sabi Abyad without any indications of breasts but having emphasized vulvae (Collet 1996:404, fig. 6.2:6-12; Duru 1999: figs. 23-24). Male representations are also known, but are relatively rare (Stekelis 1972: pl. 49:3; Dunand 1973, pl.CXIII:21160; Cauvin 1989: 81, fig. 11:1; Garfinkel 1995: 17, 19, 36-37, figs. 14:1, 30, pl. 15; Hamilton 1996: 225). However, atNevali ?ori slightly more than half of the anthropomorphic figurines that could be assigned to gender were identified as male (Hauptmann 1999: 77). Some possible hermaphroditic representations are known (Dunand 1973: pl. CXIIL21160; Cauvin 1989: fig. 11:1). With the possible exceptions ofa few male representations with erect phalli (Dunand 1973: pl. CXIIL21160; Garfinkel 1995: fig. 30:1, pl. 15:1), none of this imagery can be identified as overtly erotic. Representations of Reproduction Figurine representations of females do not often concern reproduction or child-rearing. De- pictions of pregnancy are rare and often ambigu- ous (Hamilton 1996:225; McAdam 1997:139). A figurine from Gritille Hoyiik had a bulging belly made ofa separate lump of clay; the torso beneath had an impressed navel (Voigt 1985: 16-17). A seated figurine from this site has a scar indicating that something or someone (a child?) was sitting on its lap (Voigt 2000: 269, fig. 4:b). Among the 169 female figurines fromNevah ?ori, pregnancy is indicated by eight and a mother with child is depicted by two (Hauptmann 1999: 77). There are no representations of birth until possibly the pot? tery Neolithic, and even then they are rare and ambiguous (Hamilton 1996: 225; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 204, fig. 13.25-13.26). From Neolithic sites in the Near East, there are no known figurine rep? resentations of couples copulating (and the prov? enance of the single Natufian example has been questioned; Boyd and Cook 1993). Schematization and Standardization The faces of Neolithic human figurines from the Near East are, as a rule, schematic or feature - less. While most figurines depict whole bodies, some are "busts" showing only upper bodies (McAdam 1997: 123-26, fig. 8). In some cases, the schematization of figurine bodies may be re? lated to their reuses with interchangeable heads. At several sites, proportions of the assemblages were comprised of highly schematic ceramic fig? ures with separate heads attached by dowels (Mellaart 1970: 175, fig. 233, pl. CLX; Collet 1996: 403, fig. 6.1:7; Hamilton 1996: 220-21). Large proportions of some ceramic figurine assemblages are comprised of what are often called "stalk figurines"?small (3-6 cm), conical repre? sentations with very schematic bodies in seated positions (but legs may or may not be distinguish- able), with long necks, either no heads or sche? matic heads with flattened round or elongated shapes (the latter often having pinched, beak-like noses) and very schematic or featureless faces. This type had a long span of use, from the PPNA to early Pottery Neolithic periods (de Contenson 1971: 281; 1985: 14; Cauvin 1978: figs. 25:1, 3, 5, 27: 2; Voigt 1985: 16; Noy 1989: fig. 5:2-5; Broman-Morales 1990: 61, pls. 22:b, g. iand23:a</page><page sequence="101">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 93 0 3 cm Fig. 3 Early Pottery Neolithic Human Figurines in Clay. a) Munhatta 2B-2 (after Garfinkel 1995: fig. 24): b) Shaar Hagolan (after Garfinkel et al. 2002: fig. 13.11); c) Rehov Habashan (after Cauvin 1972: fig. 29:3); d) Byblos (after Cauvin 1972: fig. 28:1). c; Hamilton 1996: 222, fig. 12:498, 527, 513; McAdam 1997: 126, 129, 131, figs. 9-10). Also known are "pillar figurines"?small (3- 6 cm), cylindrical representations with flat bases, no limbs and schematic faces. This type also ranges in time from the PPNA to the early Pottery Neolithic periods (Cauvin 1972: fig. 26: 1, 2, 4; Holland 1982: fig. 224:2; de Contenson 1995: fig. 126:9-24; Garfinkel 1995: 19, 40, figs. 11:2, 13, 14, pls. 2^4; Commenge 1997; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 201-2, figs. 13.20-13.24). Highly schematic "pebble figurines" made by scratching limestone river cobbles are common at Yarmukian (early Pottery Neolithic) sites in the southern and central Levant (Stekelis 1972: pls. 45-^8,52-54; Dunand 1973: 77-79,pls. CX-CXI; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 204-6, figs. 13.27-13.29; see also Yeivin and Mozel 1977; and Gopher and Orelle 1996). In these, the emphasis is on the eyes and to a lesser extent the mouth (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 207). However, a few also depict hips, thighs, buttocks and vests or cassock-like garments</page><page sequence="102">94 JONATHAN B. MABRY (Yeivin and Mozel 1977; Gopher and Orelle 1996: 257). Signs of gender are usually not overt in highly schematic human figurines, but are female ones whenever depicted. Very schematic PPNA stone figurines from the Levant often have v-shaped grooves or pairs of grooves representing vulvae (Stekelis and Yizraeli 1963: 197, fig. 1:6, pl. 2:F- H; Noy 1989: fig. 5:5; Cauvin 2000a: figs. 6-7). Highly schematic early Pottery Neolithic figurines at Hoyiicek have emphasized vulvae (Duru 1999: figs. 23-24). Like most clearly female representa- tions, stalk figurines are usually shown in a seated position and some have exaggerated thighs and buttocks. Yarmukian pebble figurines are also com? monly interpreted as female representations be? cause of grooves depicting large thighs and but? tocks and sometimes vulvae (Stekelis 1972: 26- 35; Yeivin and Mozel 1977; Gopher and Orelle 1996). Postures and Gestures Overall forms, body positions, postures and gestures are relatively standardized within and between assemblages. Females were most fre? quently depicted in open-legged or close-legged seated positions, while males were usually shown standing. At Nevah ?ori, all ofthe male figurines were shown in a standing position, while ninety- four percent of the female figurines were shown seated (Hauptmann 1999: 77). Common gestures of female figurines include holding the breasts with both hands (Kenyon 1957: pl. 19; Cauvin 1978: figs. 25: 4, 26: 1; Hamilton 1996: fig. 12.1:532) or supporting one or both breasts with one arm (Garfinkel 1995:35, fig. 24; Collet 1996:404, fig. 6.1:5; Garfinkel et al. 2002: figs. 13.10-13.14). Unusual gestures and positions include a re- clining female figurine from Hoyiicek (Duru 1999: fig. 22); a male figurine from Sha'ar Hagolan with his left arm resting on his phallus (Stekelis 1972: pls. 49:3, 67); a figure of unknown gender with one arm covering the face from cAin Ghazal (McAdam 1997: fig. 9:3282-14); and a figure of unknown gender in a bent-over position with the head resting on the thighs and the hands clasped around the knees from Shacar Hagolan, which is interpreted as a female in a birthing position (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 202-4, figs. 13.25-13.26). Hair, Clothing, Jewelry, and Body Decoration Heads are sometimes shaped to indicate cone- like coiffures, hats or headresses (Mellaart 1970: pl. CLIX:d; Noy 1989:17, fig. 5:3; Garfinkel 1995: 31; Garfinkel et al. 2002: 194). Yeivin and Mozel (1977) suggest that Yarmukian human figurines are depicted wearing masks (but see Garfinkel et al. 2002: 194, who interprets them as showing hair and hats). A PPNB female figurine from Munhatta had parallel incisions on the back of the neck, which may represent hair (Garfinkel 1995: 18). Some female figurines atc Ain Ghazal have painted eyes and hair; three are decorated with cordage impressions on the body, possibly representing body painting or tattoos (McAdam 1977:136, figs. 2-A). Many of the female figurines from Hacilar are shown with modeled hairstyles, including pig- tails, plaits and buns, and a few have painted hair (Mellaart 1970: 166-85, figs. 190-246, pls. CXXV-CLXX). Most Near Eastern Neolithic human figurines are naked; however, clothing and/or jewelry were occasionally depicted in all Neolithic periods. A limestone figurine from Gilgal I has a series of parallel incisions around the middle portion, per? haps representing a skirt (Noy 1989: 13, fig 5:5). A seated figurine from ?ayonii has marks indicat- ing that it had appliqued pellets around the waist, representing a beit or sash (Broman Morales 1990: 60, pl. 22:e). A few of the male figurines from Nevah ?ori are shown wearing wraps (Hauptmann 1999: 77, fig. 21). Among the Yarmukian "cow? rie-eyed" figurines from Munhatta, some are shown with earrings (Garfinkel 1995: 32, figs. 25:3,26:5, pls. 12-13), many wear garments cov- ering the upper bodies (1995: 34), one is com? pletely covered with red paint (1995: fig. 24) and others have red painted designs on the lower face and/or upper body (1995: 36, fig. 25) or lower bodies and legs (1995: 36, figs. 27:7, 29:1, 2, 5, Pl. 14:4-5). Many ofthe Yarmukian figurines from Sha'ar Hagolan also show earrings, clothing and facial and body painting (Stekelis 1972: pl. 49; Yeivin and Mozel 1977; Garfinkel et al. 2002).</page><page sequence="103">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 95 Aprons and robes are depicted with white or red paint on a number of the female figurines from Hacilar (Mellaart 1970: figs. 207-9, 225, 239, 242-45, pls. CXXVIII, CXXXVIII, CL) and sev? eral have modeled bikini-like briefs (1970: figs. 192, 195-97, pls. CXXV-CXXVII). Differences by Region Most of the general patterns described in the previous sections extend across all ofthe Levant and southern Anatolia. However, a few patterns appear to be limited to specific regions or sets of adjacent regions. These spatial patterns include: human figurines made from bone and plaster only in the southern Levant; pebble figurines only in the southern and central Levant; removable heads attached to bodies with wooden dowels limited to the northern Levant and adjacent south-central Anatolia; female figurines with exaggerated vul? vae only in the northern Levant and nearby south? westem Anatolia; human figurines placed in shrines only in southwestem, and possibly south- central, Anatolia; destmction of human figurines by burning only in southeastern and south-central Anatolia; and depictions of humans sitting or riding on animals only in south-central Anatolia. It has also been observed that in the southern Levant, anthropomorphic figurines have not been found at Middle and Late PPNB sites west ofthe Jordan Valley, even though excavations have been conducted at five sites dating to those phases (Kuijt and Goring-Morris 2002: 398). However, this is probably too small a sample of sites to be sure this is a real pattern. Also, the stone human figurines from PPNA levels at Nahal Oren (Stekelis and Yizraeli 1963: 197, fig. 1: 6, pl. 2:F-H) indicate that no such geographical difference existed ear? lier. Likewise, very few PPNA sites have been excavated in southern Anatolia, and the lack of PPNA anthropomorphic figurines from this region, except possibly at ?ay6nti (the contexts ofthe figu? rines at this site are not assigned to phases; Broman Morales 1990: 57-75), may also be only a sam? pling problem. The spatial distributions that can confidently be identified indicate either cultural differences or cultural connections in terms of how the hu- man body was depicted, the meanings of human figurines and the ritual practices involving human figurines. Not surprisingly, the southern and cen? tral Levant appear to have been more connected to each other than with other regions, the northern Levant seems to have been more connected with southern Anatolia and the southern Anatolian re? gions were most closely connected to one another. Of course, future discoveries and publication of more illustrations and descriptions may change some of these distributions and the cultural rela? tionships they imply. Changes Over Time Some patterns within figurine assemblages seem to have changed over time. While naturalis- tic and schematic depictions of seated females with exaggerated lower bodies were the predominant style through the entire Neolithic and in all regions, standing female figurines were also common from PPNA times on, and legless pillar figurines be? came widespread during the PPNB before declin? ing during the early Pottery Neolithic. From the PPNB to the Yarmukian periods at Munhatta, the dominant style of figurines changed from stand? ing pillar figurines in which the upper body was emphasized to seated cowrie-eyed figurines in which the lower body was emphasized (Garfinkel 1995). Depictions of gender, currently unknown for the Natufian period, began during the PPNA pe? riod, from which only female representations are known. Across the Near East, male representations generally increased through time, except at ?atal Hoyiik, where males disappear and overtly female representations increase after Level VI (Hamilton 1996: 225). Depictions of women giving birth did not appear anywhere in the Near East until they were first made in both the southern Levant and south-central Anatolia during the late Pottery Neolithic (see above). The symbolic relationships between human and animal figurines seem to have changed over time. Zoomorphic figurines from PPNA sites de- pict raptors, snakes, felines and goats (Kozlowski 1989: figs. 8-9; Noy 1989, fig. 5:1; Cauvin et al. 1999: fig. 33; Rosenberg 1999: 28, figs. 3,4:1-7,</page><page sequence="104">96 JONATHAN B. MABRY 9, 11, 14, 15), but these have not been found in direct association with human figurines. In both the Levant and southern Anatolia, no cattle figu? rines can be dated confidently to this phase. The first definite cattle figurines appeared during the middle PPNB period in these regions; the first examples of associations between human and cattle figurines also date to this phase (Voigt 1985: 16; McAdam 1997: 136-37; Ozdogan 1999: 59). These first human-animal figurine associations were with wild animals, as cattle were not yet do? mesticated. Cattle were first domesticated in some areas during the late PPNB, and from this phase onward associations between human figurines and cattle figurines in general (see above), and between those depicting females and bulls specifically, ap? pear to have increased through time (Cauvin 2000a). Figurine depictions of humans with leop? ards first appeared in southern Anatolia during the early Pottery Neolithic (Mellaart 1970: 166-85; Hamilton 1996). Human Representations in Other Scales and Media Larger Sculptural Figures. There are often two scales of human representation at Near Eastern Neolithic sites?small figurines and busts between 3 and 15 cm high, and larger "statuettes," statues and busts. A 14-cm high, female statuette made from limestone was found in a possible PPNC context at cAin Ghazal; its head was broken off and missing and it was found face-down on a small stone platform at the top ofa series of small steps (Rollefson 2000). Small ceramic busts at cAin Ghazal resemble the large plaster busts at the site. A large plaster bust was also found at Jericho (Kenyon and Holland 1981: 290, pl. 72). Caches of plaster statues depicting both males and females were buried in pits at several PPNB sites, includ? ing cAin Ghazal (Tubb and Grissom 1995), Jeri? cho (Garstang etal. 1935:166), Nahal Hemar (Bar- Yosef and Alon 1988: 20-21) and Tell Ramad (de Contenson 1971). At least three ofthe statues at c Ain Ghazal had two heads facing the same direc? tion (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b). A 35-cm high ceramic statue from Sha'ar Hagolan reconstmcted from fragments resembles the ceramic female "cowrie-eyed" figurines at the site (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 190-93). At Tell Ramad (PPNB Level II) were found seated, headless plaster "statuettes," probably used to support the plastered human skulls found in association. Among the sculptural human representations at ?atal Hoyiik and Hacilar, the sizes and forms of statuettes and figurines grade into each other, and the distinctions between these types often seem arbitrary. However, among the fifty-one "statu? ettes" from ?atal Hoyiik, females seated on stools or leopards contrast with the smaller figurine rep? resentations of seated females without stools or animal rests; other female and male statuettes from the site are shown in standing positions, riding animals or embracing; some female statuettes de- pict pregnancy, birth, holding a child and holding one or two leopard cubs (Mellaart 1967: 178-203; Voigt 2000: 277-87). One marble twin figurine in a standing position has two heads, two pairs of breasts and a single pair of arms (Mellaart 1967: pls. 70-71). Stone males are usually seated, often on an animal's back; some of these are probably bulls, but others may be felines (Voigt 2000:287). Some differences and trends in terms of ma? terials can be seen in the human representations at this scale. All of the clay statuettes from ?atal Hoyiik are female or indeterminate, while most of the stone versions that can be assigned to gender are male (Voigt 2000: 283). While stone statuettes predominated in the earliest levels, the proportion of clay statuettes increased through the sequence and became predominate in latest levels (Mellaart 1967: 181). Some ofthe portable, large human representations at this site are stalactite and sta- lagmite fragments and other limestone concretions with human-like shapes that were only slightly modified (Mellaart 1967: 178-79, pl. 65). The statuettes at this site were found in situ in intramural contexts, including clustered around hearths and in grain bins (Mellaart 1967: 183; Voigt 2000: 277, 281). Deliberate damage or de? struction was a common treatment. All but one of the clay statuettes and many of the stone statu? ettes from ?atal Hoyiik are missing their heads (Hamilton 1996: table 12.4) and the single excep? tion among the clay examples is broken at the neck and mended; scars on the shoulders of many of</page><page sequence="105">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 97 the clay and stone statuettes suggest that the break- age was deliberate, rather than accidental break- age at the point of weakness (Voigt 2000: 281? 82). A broken-off head of a stone figurine was deliberately defaced by chipping off the face (Hamilton 1996: 220-21). Each ofthe Level VI buildings that contained stone statuettes was bumed, apparently deliberately (Voigt 2000:282). A similar range of positions, compositions and treatments, plus female figures in reclining posi? tions, are represented in the assemblage of 109 ceramic statuettes between 7 and 24 cm high re? covered from Hacilar (Mellaart 1970: 166-75). The earliest examples, from Level IX, were two fragmentary figures found in domestic trash. All forty-five clay statuettes from Level VI were found on the floors of several houses that had bumed in the same fire, often clustered near the hearths and never with other types of objects. In one of these houses, a set of statuettes was imbedded in a de? posit of grain. All of the statuettes depicted females with exaggerated breasts, stomachs, thighs and but- tocks, and navels are shown. They are in standing, seated, squatting and reclining positions, and two are seated on leopards. Many are shown cupping both breasts with the hands. One is in a crouched stance that may represent a birthing position. Sev? eral hold children and a few hold small felines. Faces are schematic, showing only incised eyes and modeled noses and ears. The depictions of younger females have hair in pigtails, multiple plaits tied together behind the head or plaits coiled on top of the head; depictions of older females have hair tied up in buns at the back of the head. Some of the Level IX statuettes wear white- or black-painted aprons or robes and a few have black-painted eyes and hair. Statuettes in the later levels are mostly painted monochrome red or brown, but some are decorated with red or brown paint. Leopards and females sitting on animals disappeared, and they were placed in graves for the first time. Sculptured Pillars. A number of large human rep- resentations in stone or on stone pillars have been found at Nevah ?ori, including a larger-than- lifesize limestone head with the face broken off and a snake design on the back ofthe head; a pil- lar with a damaged human face; a pillar with a representation ofa woman supporting her breasts with her hands; other pillars with female figures (one giving birth?); a pillar or "totem pole" with a series of composite human (female?)-bird crea- tures; and fragments of heads and torsos (Hauptmann 1999: figs. 10-14; Voigt 2000). Inthe same region, a large stone human head, stone stat? ues of males with erect phalli, a large carving on a stone slab showing a woman giving birth and large stone sculptures of animals on human heads and an animal with a human head were found at Gobekli Tepe (Schmidt 1998; 2001; Hauptmann 1999: figs. 26,28, 33, 35). At the latter site, all of the large sculptures of humans and animals are male (Verhoeven 2002: 241). Large stelae with carved heads of raptors were also found in one of the "communal buildings" at Jerf el-Ahmar in the northern Levant (Stordeur et al. 2001: 40, fig. 11). Depictions in Wall Paintings and Reliefs. Among the human representations in the wall frescoes at ?atal Hoyiik are males depicted in red and females depicted in white; some headless (male?) figures are shown being decapitated by flying vultures (Mellaart 1967: pls. 45, 48, 49). Also depicted on walls in plaster relief are females, twin females and possibly breasts, including some possible breasts with fox, weasel or vulture skulls inside the breasts and sometimes protruding from the nipples, plaster representations of women in pos? sible child-birth postures have been interpreted as giving birth to bulls' and rams' heads (Mellart 1967: 124-25; but see Last 1998; Meskell 1998; and Voigt 2000 for critiques of these interpreta? tions). All ofthe heads ofthe human and animal figures in relief were destroyed, and often the hands and feet were also damaged (Mellaart 1967: 82; Voigt 2000: 289). Some spatial patterning has been identified, namely, tendencies for specific motifs to occur on different sides: birth scenes tended to occur on west walls, death scenes on east walls, and bull representations on north walls (Mellaart 1967:104). Modeled Skulls. During the PPNA period and the prior Natufian period in the Levant, some human skulls were removed from their bodies and inhumed separately or displayed in houses singly</page><page sequence="106">98 JONATHAN B. MABRY or in groups (see references in Goring-Morris 2000; Kuijt 2000). This practice was elaborated during the PPNB period, when seashells were placed in the eye sockets and skulls were plas? tered, painted and appliqued with bitumen to re- semble faces and hair. These modeled skulls were displayed in houses and buried singly and in groups beneath house floors and in outdoor pits (see ref? erences in Bienert 1995; Campbell and Green 1995; Kuijt 1996, 2000; Cauvin 2000a; Goring- Morris 2000). Some of these patterns of display extend to southern Anatolia. At ?ayonti, a build? ing was found with the skulls of seventy individu? als displayed in a separate room (Schirmer 1990). Rows of skulls were found on benches in some "shrine" buildings at ?atal Hoyiik (Mellaart 1967: 78, 84). Other Human Representations. In addition to the sculptured pillars, non-portable representations of humans include a large stone basin with a human head in relief found in the Terrazzo building at ^ayonii (Ozdogan 1999: fig. 43). Other portable representations of humans include small depictions of human heads without bodies (some drilled to make them into pendants) made of stone or bone at Mureybet (Cauvin 1978: fig. 26:2; 2000a: fig. 32:4), Munhatta (Cauvin 2000a: fig. 39: 4-5), Nahal Hemar (Bar-Yosef and Alon 1988: 21-23, fig. 14, pl. IX) andNevah ?ori (Hauptmann 1999: figs. 18-19); two stone beads in the shape of kneel- ing females from Byblos (Dunand 1973: 83, fig. 47); a necklace of blue stone beads, graded in size and shaped like schematic seated (female?) figu? rines, found with an ochre-painted burial of a young woman at ?atal Hoyiik (Mellaart 1967: pl. 81); stone masks with painted designs at Nahal Hemar (Bar-Yosef 1985: 14, 22-23) and Basta (Gebel et al. 1988: 126); clay and limestone slab figures incised to show schematic faces (and in one case, a vulva) from Hacilar (Mellaart 1970: 176, figs. 235-37, pls. CLXI-CLXIII); a stone bowl fragment from Nevali ?ori with two anthro? pomorphic figures flanking a reptilian figure (Hauptmann 1999: fig. 16); a stone plaque with two pairs of embracing figures (one pair showing two adults, the other showing an adult and child) from Catal Hoyiik (Mellaart 1967: pl. 83); a hu- man figure in relief on a pot from c Ain el-Jarba (Kaplan 1969); and painted anthropomorphic pots at Hacilar (Mellaart 1970: fig. 102, pls. CLXXII, CLXXVI). This list of known examples is prob? ably not exhaustive. A number of possible representations of hu? man genitalia have also been identified. A stone figurine from ?atal Hoyiik appears to be a repre- sentation of a female with pendulous breasts, carved into a phallic shape (Meskell 1998: fig. 12; Voigt 2000: 289). More speculative are the pos? sible ceramic representations of male genitalia with cordage impressions at cAin Ghazal (McAdam 1997: 123, figs. 6-7); possible ceramic represen? tations of both male and female genitals at Jebel Abu Thawab (Kafafi 1993:103); and highly sche- matic, possible stone representations of vulvae and phalli at Munhatta and Sha'ar Hagolan (Stekelis 1972: 33-34, pls. 56-59; Gopher and Orelle 1996: 267-74, figs. 3-5; however, see criticisms of this interpretation in Garfinkel 1999b). SOME COMMON SOCIAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CHANGES IN NEOLITHIC SOCIETIES The variety of human imagery at Near East? ern Neolithic sites clearly shows that the transi? tion to agriculture and village life represented not only a revolution in economic and social organi? zation, but also a watershed change in ideology and symbols. A comparative perspective shows that certain ideological structures were common among neolithic/formative societies worldwide, and the interaction of several of these favored the construc? tion of ancestry, continuing roles for the dead, development ofa domestic ritual sphere controlled by women and community integration through a public ritual sphere dominated by men. The Importance of Households andLineages One ofthe common trends in neolithic/forma? tive transitions around the world was the emer? gence ofthe household as the fimdamental social and economic unit (Flannery 1972). This has been described as a shift from communal organization with public storage and unrestricted sharing of food to nuclear family households with private</page><page sequence="107">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 99 food storage and consumption (Wills 1992; Byrd 1994; Flannery 2002). Some simulation models have predicted that the shift to the household as the basic unit of production and sharing was nec? essary to manage risk effectively, because contin? ued generalized reciprocity and unrestricted shar? ing would have increased the risk of food short- falls (Winterhalder 1990; Hegmon 1991; Kelly 1991). Microeconomic models have been cited to explain that the shift was necessary to maximize the productivity and efficiency of the new economy; continuing unrestricted sharing would have inhibited surplus production and diminished returns on labor investments (Wills 1992). In the minds of some researchers, the increas- ing importance of the household was not merely organizational, but also ideological, with the household becoming a symbolic constmct. These models hold that the household was an important symbol in the "domestication" of societies, prior to the domestication of plants and animals: "do? mesticated society relies to a great extent on the house as both a dominant cultural symbol and a central rallying point and context for social orga? nization and activity" (Wilson 1988: 4). Hodder argues that it was through the metaphor of the house, or domus, "that the origins of agriculture were thought about and conceived," and this was the mechanism for the domestication of society and the creation of larger social units (1990: 38). He points out that the very word "domestication" is derived from the Indo-European word root for "house" (Hodder 1990). The restriction of storage and sharing to the household unit, and labor investments by house? holds in fields and agricultural infrastructures like canals and terraces, led to the concept of private property. With this development there arose a need for rules of property tenure and inheritance, and keeping track of kinship, descent and lineage be? came important for each household. Whether these structures were real or fictional was probably un- important?they were ideological structures that served important integrative functions. Kuijt (2000) has applied Levi-Strauss' (1983) model ofthe "House" as a unit of social organiza? tion in which fictive kinship through alliance and adoption is the basis for economic production, property holding, inheritance and ritualism. He argues that such "Houses," comprised of multiple households united by real or fictive common an- cestry, were the basic structural units in Near East? ern Neolithic communities, and that protracted and public mortuary rituals served to unite competi- tive Houses by fostering community solidarity. While Levi-Strauss sees the "House" as originat? ing as a metaphor borrowed from prior concepts of kinship, Wilson thinks it is equally possible that it was the precursor and foundation for the later concepts of descent, lineage, and clan that helped reconcile the inherent tensions between house? holds and communities: Neolithic societies, as distinct from Paleolithic hunter/gatherers or urban industrial societies, are specified as being "kinship and descent" based societies. But the household and the settlement are the physical basis for whatever unity exists and for the performance of rou- tines. While people may choose to live together and be neighbors because they are kin, the fact remains that kinship only serves as the means to the end. What is more, not all those who acknowledge themselves to be kin or members of the same descent group live together as a real, functioning group of cooperating people, let alone regard themselves as forming a col- lective with a common will. Rather, the real on-the-ground-cohabiting-group is defined first and foremost residentially. But it is an uncertain alliance, an unstable collectivity that contradicts or at least goes against the image of unity imposed by the boundaries of the settlement itself. It might be said that the de? velopment of kinship and descent as the bases for socially uniting individuals into groups is an ideological development that counters the brirtleness of households and settlements (Wil? son 1988: 168). The Division Between Public and Private With the shift to the household as the funda- mental social, economic and symbolic unit of so? ciety, there also developed a division between pub? lic and private life. The movement of food storage inside houses helped create this division, but it was enhanced by the spatial structures and architec? tural forms in early farming communities. Walls divided space into public and private areas, creat-</page><page sequence="108">100 JONATHAN B. MABRY ing separate arenas for social actions, and imping- ing on the ability of people to monitor each oth? ers' behavior (Byrd 1994). People responded to these constraints on the conditions of attention "by developing modes of surveillance, supervision and inspection, andby evolving stratagems of evasion and display" (Wilson 1988: 182). The division between public and private social and economic life, then, resulted in a conceptual dichotomy as well. Maintenance of Community Integration and Egalitarianism In early farming villages there was "a built-in contradiction between the economically self-suf- ficient household ... and its spatial coexistence with other such households in village and terri? tory" (Wilson 1988: 100). While each household needed to control its own fields and the food it produced, there was also a need for labor pooling and cooperation to clear fields, build and main- tain canals and protect resources, such that "the interests of the individual household conflicted with the emphasis on communal socialized pro? duction" (Hodder 1990: 132). Because of this in- herent tension between independence and depen- dence, ideologies and social mechanisms devel? oped to help integrate households, foster commu? nal solidarity and egalitarianism, and reaffirm com? mon identity. "In this sense, the Neolithic com? munity had continually to be recreated" (Whittle 1996: 355). In Near Eastern Neolithic communities, these functions may have been served by limited and uniform grave offerings (Kuijt 1996), public mor? tuary rituals (Kuijt 2000) and communal rituals centered around large-scale human representations of shared deities or the "mythical founders ofthe community of clans" (Rollefson 2000: 185). The unchanging aspects of mortuary rituals and the use of common cemeteries also symbolized continu? ity ofthe group over many generations?"a com? mon ancestral past" (Whittle 1996: 362). Segregation ofMale and Female Rituals The gender dichotomy between a public/com- munity-oriented male sphere and a domestic/ household-oriented female sphere that character? ized many historical village communities and con? tinues to operate in traditional societies (Rosaldo 1974) probably emerged in early farming commu? nities concurrently with the development of a di? vision between public and private life and the growing importance of integrative communal ritu? als. Cross-culturally, this dichotomy usually ex? tends to men's and women's access to ritual knowl- edge as well as their participation in public and domestic ceremonies (Brandt 1994). In Oaxaca, Mexico during the Pre-Classic pe? riod, the domestic contexts of ceramic figurines predominately depicting females, the different treatments and locations of male and female buri? als (with male burials associated with large, "pub? lic" buildings), and the exclusive association of pottery vessels with complex iconography with male burials, have been interpreted as indicating a division between the contexts of male and fe? male rituals (Marcus 1998: 79-80; 1999). While female figurines appear to have been the focus of domestic ancestor veneration rituals conducted by women, male burials appear to have been the fo? cus of public ancestor veneration rituals, with only males having the prerogative to display symbols ofthe supernatural (Marcus 1999). The Presence ofthe Dead The dead played a variety of important roles in early agricultural societies. The presence of buri? als within a settlement was a representation of continuity?the dead continued to participate in the life ofthe community. The locations of family plots in habitation areas, and of burials beneath house floors, also emphasized the household as the new context of economic activity and social actions, and as the dominant symbol of the do? mesticated in contrast with the wild (Wilson 1988: 4 and passim; Hodder 1990: 36 and passim). The presence of the dead also promoted at? tachment to place, tying people to the land itself, simultaneous with a new relationship with the earth associated with the practice of agriculture (Pearson 1999: 161). Cemeteries were also territorial mark? ers for communities (Saxe 1970: 119; Goldstein 1976: 61). "The act of burial itself also serves to physically 'plant' the dead into the land, making</page><page sequence="109">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 101 their remains an inalienable and fixed part ofthe land" (Pearson 1999: 17). The presence ofthe dead and funeral ceremo- nies were also important in the construction of ancestry?a new concem related to the develop? ment of household property and inheritance. Com? parisons of ethnographic cases show that the prac? tice of keeping ancestors within the realm of the living not only marks territories and provides a sense of common social identity, it materially and symbolically legitimizes the resource use rights and property claims of their descendants. "Where death involves the transfer of rights and duties over people and through them over other property, we might expect to find more complex funerals ... and more claims on the ancestors to legitimate descent and inheritance than in systems where death does not involve such transfers" (Morris 1991:152). In early farming villages, lineage mem- bership provided access to restricted resources, and maintenance of lineage continuity by tracking and commemorating genealogies provided a mecha- nism for transferring properties and access rights to descendants: "through ancestors, resource rights and privileges were viewed in the conservative light of precedents set by progenitors (McAnany 1995: 8). ETHNOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF ANCESTOR RITUALS The ideological structures, socioeconomic roles and archaeological signatures of ancestor veneration in early farming communities can best be explored through comparisons of ethnographic data. Ancestor rituals are widespread among agri? cultural villagers around the world, especially in societies in which multi-generational lineages or descent groups are important principles and units of organization (e.g., Fortes 1965, 1976; Freed? man 1966, 1970; Ahern 1973; Newell 1976a; Kerns 1983; Feldman 1985a; Leopold 1991; McAnany 1995; Marcus 1998). These rituals gen? erally involve communicating with deceased rela- tives, making offerings to them (including food offerings that figuratively "feed the ancestors"), seeking their assistance with matters in the living world, and asking for their intervention in rela- tionships with supernatural forces and gods (which are often remote, deified ancestors). Ancestors can be either benevolent or danger- ous, depending upon the circumstances of their death and their treatment after death. Deceased persons with no offspring to provide offerings to them, or who died dishonorably or from unnatural causes, may become malevolent and cause sick- ness, violence and other misfortunes; persons who died naturally and honorably may also be harmful if they are not treated properly as ancestors, with failures to meet obligations bringing disease, mis- fortune and infertility (Feldman 1985b: 35). Obligations to ancestors can be substantial. These often include offerings of some ofthe first harvest of crops before they can be consumed by the living, sacrifices of valuable livestock and even human sacrifices. In the Middle East, pre-Islamic Bedouin sacrificed sheep or goats and made liba- tions at the tombs ofthe eponymous ancestors of their tribes (Henninger 1981: 10). Food offerings usually result in feasting, during which monuments or artworks are dedicated or gifts are distributed, memorializing the feast and the ancestor; in addi? tion to honoring and propitiating the ancestor, the feast gives status to the host in proportion to its size and expense (Feldman 1985b: 36). The larg? est feasts occur at funerals, at which the ancestors are also considered to be present. In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, wild plants and animals are never offered to the ancestors, al? though their admirable qualities?strength, speed, courage, virility and fecundity?are attributed to the ancestors, and ancestor representations often have zoomorphic features (Feldman 1985b: 36). In some cultures that practice ancestor veneration, clans (groups of related lineages) have genealogi- cal depths so great that links to the same founding ancestors are assumed rather than known in de? tail, and so they use mythical animals, plants or natural forces as emblems (or "totems") of their solidarity, and sometimes trace their common de? scent from them (e.g., Lawrence and Meggitt 1965: 8; Sumnik-Dekovich 1985: 102 and passim; Leopoldl991:ch. 4). Not all ofthe dead become ancestors and not all ancestors are equally important. Typically, not every deceased person in a lineage is venerated;</page><page sequence="110">102 JONATHAN B. MABRY only adults with offspring, and often only impor? tant ones within a descent line, become ancestors (Fortes 1965: 127 and passim; Freedman 1970: 165). Also common are protracted mortuary ritu? als, often involving exhuming of primary burials and displaying or reburying portions of the skel? eton, usually skulls and limb bones, in houses or mausoleums (McAnany 1995: 11-14). Such ex? tended mortuary rites serve important functions in the living community because they "increase the room for manoeuvre in those aspects ... which are concemed with renewing, reorganizing and relegitimising (sic) relations among the living" (Humphreys 1981: 268). While all who quality to become ancestors may pass through the initial stages of extended mortuary rites, only the most important individuals in the lineage, or those from the wealthiest families, reach the final stage (Watson 1988: 208). Mortuary rituals, then, are not the same as ancestor veneration rituals; the latter emphasize lineage unity, and the former tend to be arenas for status competition within the lin? eage (Freedman 1966:130-32; Morris 1991:153). The statuses of ancestors determine the places and actors of veneration rituals. The primary lo? cus of ancestor veneration is in the household (Fortes 1976: 7 and passim), and in this context it is women who most frequently conduct the rituals (Freedman 1970: 164 and passim; Kems 1983: 2 and passim). In China, recent ancestors of both sexes are commemorated and consulted privately by women in each household, while more remote (mostly male) ancestors are publicly honored by males in tombs and "ancestral halls" (Freedman 1970: 167-76). Recent ancestors are more typi? cally regarded as elders that continue to partici- pate in the life ofthe community; rather than be? ing worshipped, they are contacted, consulted and propitiated (Kopytoff 1971). In contrast, remote ancestors?including male and female counter- parts, but mostly males?are sometimes treated as deities or heroes ofa mythic time or plane; they may represent collective ancestors and are there? fore emblems of group identity for several co-resi- dent, related lineages (Freedman 1970; McAnany 1995; Marcus 1998; Pearson 1999). The memory or active presence of ancestors in the living community can be symbolized by a variety of material objects, including houses, fam- ily heirlooms, monuments, tombs, coffins, cem? eteries, skulls, sculptural and painted images and masks. The use of statues and figurines in ances? tor rituals has been documented historically and ethnographically among many societies around the world; wooden, ceramic or stone representations of forebears are used in rites of ancestor venera? tion inAfrica(Fortes 1965: 139;Rattray 1927: 11 and passim), Mexico (Marcus 1998; McAnany 1995), China (Ahern 1973) and Indonesia (Feldman 1985a). These rituals are conducted to summon the spirits of ancestors and communicate with them. Marcus (1998: ch. 3) cites sixteenth and sev? enteenth century documents that show that, in the Zapotec culture of Oaxaca, Mexico, women in each household invoked recent ancestors by call- ing their name. This action, called "geneonymy" by anthropologists (Newell 1976b), served to ani- mate figurine representations that provided the physical venues to which ancestor spirits could return. Because death generally results in loss of individual personalities in societies that practice ancestor veneration (Kopytoff 1971: 129; Newell 1976b: 22), figurines do not need to look very much like specific ancestors. Instead, speaking the person's name can invoke his distinctive attributes. The figurine makers of Oaxaca therefore empha? sized attributes that conveyed an individual's age, marital status and social position?the social per- sona?rather than his visual appearance (Marcus 1998: 19,25,ch. 6). ARCHAEOLOGICAL SIGNS OF ANCESTOR VENERATION AT NEAR EASTERN NEOLITHIC SITES The association of Near Eastern Neolithic figurines with ancestor veneration is not based solely upon ethnographic analogy, but can also be inferred by their context in the larger set of ritual material culture. In the Levant and southern Anatolia, it appears that Neolithic human figurines were symbolically linked to other types of human imagery that were probably used in ancestor ven? eration rituals. Including human imagery, the pos? sible lines of evidence of ancestor veneration ritu? als are numerous: multiple-stage, secondary mortu? ary practices that include burial beneath house</page><page sequence="111">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 103 floors and walls; modeling of portrait-like faces on skulls; display of skulls in houses and shrines; feasting in cemeteries; making portrait-like stat? ues at scales suitable for public viewing; erection of pillars and other monuments decorated with possibly totemic images of certain animals; and use of schematic statuettes and figurines in houses. The best evidence of ancestor veneration are the special treatments and displays of skulls dur? ing the Late Natufian, PPNA and PPNB periods, which have been widely interpreted as represent? ing an ancestor cult (e.g., Kenyon 1957, 1970; de Vaux 1966; Cauvin 1972, 2000a; Strouhal 1973; Mellaart 1975; Bar-Yosef 1985; Arensburg and Hershkovitz 1989; Simmons et al. 1990; Bienert 1991; Garfinkel 1994; Kuijt 1996, 2000, 2001; Pearson 1999; Goren et al. 2001). However, they have also been attributed to a cult of mythical he- roes (Goring-Morris 2000: 124, 127), and Schmandt-Besserat (2002) has referred to ancient Mesopotamian texts describing the use of skulls in curing and divination rituals to argue that Neolithic plastered skulls were used similarly. I believe that multiple lines of evidence point more strongly to ancestor veneration. There are a number of indications that the skulls were removed post-mortem after some time had passed (cf Kuijt 2001). Both males and fe? males are represented by separated skulls, with one gender predominating at some sites (Cauvin 2000a). While infants did not have their skulls re? moved, at cAin Ghazal children older than 15-18 months usually underwent post-mortem decapita- tion (Rollefson 2000). One ofthe plastered skulls represents a youth in his mid-teens, but the rest of the known plastered skulls are adults. The skulls were often separated from the bodies without the lower mandibles (Griffin et al. 1998), and some show signs of post-mortem removal of teeth (FerembachandLechevallier 1973; Strouhal 1973; Arensburg and Hershkovitz 1988). The teeth were removed possibly to make them look old, "allud- ing to a concept of rule and seniority ofthe elders (Arensburg and Hershkovitz 1988: 57). The modeled skulls are somewhat distinctive, and have been interpreted as portraits of individu? als (Kenyon 1957; Simmons et al. 1990; Banning 1998). It has been suggested that face modeling was limited to only the skulls of individuals with particular (artificially deformed?) head shapes (Arensburg and Hershkovitz 1988) or members of particular lineages (Kuijt 2001). Some modeled skulls show multiple layers of plaster and paint (Hershkovitz et al. 1995; Goren et al. 2001) sug? gesting that they were remodeled and displayed for long periods, possibly several generations. Special buildings in which large numbers of skulls were displayed, such as the Skull Building at ?ayonti, probably represent ancestral halls ofthe communities. Most of the buried skulls were in damaged condition, and their burial may represent ritual disposal of worn-out cult items after long periods of display and handling (Garfinkel 1994). The removal and burial of three modeled plaster faces atc Ain Ghazal has been similarly interpreted (Griffin et al. 1998). The burial locations of skulls and bodies may have symbolized continuities of household lin? eages (Kuijt 2001). Decapitated individuals were sealed beneath house floors, skull caches, second? ary burials and intact primary burials were buried beneath courtyard surfaces, and children were buried intact above skull caches, within and be? neath house walls, below thresholds, in the holes for roof-support posts and in domestic trash middens (Rollefson 1986, 2000; Banning 1998; Kuijt 2000,2001). Another mortuary practice may have been graveside feasting, as suggested by the large number of roasting pits containing burned animal bones found in the cemetery/ritual center at Kfar Hahoresh (Goring-Morris 2000: 114). The ethnographic patterns of only important individuals in descent lines qualifying for ancestorhood, and only those from high-status lin? eages reaching the final stages of secondary mor? tuary treatments, also appear to be supported. To? gether, the curation of children's skulls, the pref- erential selection of adult skulls of certain shapes, and the fact that only a small proportion of village inhabitants are represented by the remains that have been found suggest that higher status was ascribed to certain lineages (Goring-Morris 2000; Rollefson 2000; Kuijt 2001). The depiction ofa foot with six toes on a plaster statue from cAin Ghazal and on another one from Jericho may re? flect genetic relationships between members of</page><page sequence="112">104 JONATHAN B. MABRY those widely separated communities (Rollefson 1983; Bienert 1995); if so, then the sculptural de? pictions of both these related individuals may in? dicate that this polydactyl lineage had a higher sta? tus than some others. Small figurines have rarely been found as grave offerings or in association with the skulls. However, at Tell Ramad, larger human represen? tations without heads were found with plastered skulls; these statuettes were probably used to sup? port the skulls, which had necks of plaster (de Contenson 1971). At several other sites (see above), small figurines designed for easy removal or changing of heads may be symbolic parallels to this type of imagery. After the secondary mortuary practices cen- tered in domestic spaces and the modeling and display of skulls, perhaps the next best signs of ancestor veneration are the larger statues and their treatments. The anthropomorphic plaster statues found at several PPNB sites in the southern and central Levant (see above) have been interpreted as representations of deities (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b) or ghosts (Schuster 1995). However, Rollefson (2000) has suggested that they portray the mythical founders of communities, and others have suggested that the statues depicted venerated ancestors (Kenyon 1957; de Contenson 1967; Pearson 1999). Their large sizes may indicate their display during public rituals (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b; Kuijt 2000; Rollefson 2000). The statues in the caches were all in damaged condition prior to burial, and the caches have been interpreted as ritual disposals of wom-out cultic objects rather than votive offerings (Garfinkel 1994). At both Ain Ghazal and Wadi Shu'eib, figurines have been found in direct association with plaster statues that are distinctive enough to be portraits of individu? als. Other types of human images may also be an? cestor representations. Although anthropomorphic statuettes are usually interpreted as representations of deities (e.g., Mellaart 1967: 178-203; Schmandt-Besserat 1998a; Cauvin 2000a: 29 and passim), the similarity of their intramural contexts, imagery, associations and treatments suggests that they are merely larger-scale versions of figurines. However, they may depict more important and remote ancestors that became semi-deified over time, and whose images were curated and dis? played over many generations. The stone masks may have been representations of ancestors worn during public rituals. Hamilton (1996: 227) suggests that the recur- ring motifs of wild animals in wall paintings and wall reliefs at ?atal Hoyiik may represent clan to- tems rather than deities, and the people shown in paintings wearing leopard skins and red (deer?) skins could be signifying their clan affiliations in scenes of ritual contests between clans (Garfinkel 2003: ch. 1 and passim interprets these scenes as ritual dancing serving a similar purpose). Likewise, the raptor, snake, lion and other wild animal mo? tifs on stone pillars at earlier Neolithic sites in southern Anatolia and the northern Levant (Schmidt 1998,2001; Hauptmann 1999; Stordeur et al. 2001) may also have been totemic symbols of clans erected in communal shrines. The public contexts of these large images fits with the ethno- graphic pattern of remote, semi-deified ancestors being honored in communal shrines, and the pre- dominance of male human and animal imagery in these settings at some sites may reflect the cross- cultural pattern of male dominance of the public ritual sphere and its symbols. Extending this in? terpretation, the prevalence of aurochs represen? tations in wall paintings, reliefs and sculpture may mean that wild cattle were the totem ofthe whole ?atal Hoyiik society (Hamilton 1996: 227), and the aurochs skulls, horns and other remains dis? played in buildings and even built into walls at PPNA and PPNB sites in the northern Levant and southern Anatolia (cf. Ozdogan 1999; Rosenberg 1999: 27; Cauvin 2000a: 89; Stordeur 2000; Stordeur et al. 2001) may have been symbols ofa shared fictive ancestry and common cultural iden? tity across much of the Near East during those periods. Totemic animals are not taboo to eat and are appropriate offerings for the ancestors in some societies (e.g., Leopold 1991: ch. 4). This raises the possibility that, rather than being symbols used in curing rituals (Schmandt-Besserat 1997), the figurines of aurochs, birds, sheep, goats, ibexes, felines and other wild (and in the later Neolithic, domesticated) animals?many of which were in-</page><page sequence="113">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 105 tentionally broken or impaled (e.g. McAdam 1997: 131-34)?may stand for sacrifices of totemic ani? mals to "feed the ancestors." Occurrences of bull figurines sometimes in much larger proportions than are represented in faunal bone assemblages may indicate the difficulty or expense in killing real ones. There also may have been an additional symbolic significance of bulls related to their wild- ness, dangerousness, and virility (Hodder 1990: 12 and passim; Rice 1998: 8 and passim; Cauvin 2000a: 31 and passim; Rollefson 2000; Verhoeven 2002). The blood traces of humans, aurochs and sheep identified on a large stone table in the Skull Building at ?ayonii, and the traces of humans and aurochs blood on a large flint knife from that build? ing (Wood 1998), appear to indicate that human and animal sacrifices were associated with ances? tor veneration in that society. Finally, there are the human figurines them? selves. In addition to their primarily domestic con? texts of use, the characteristics and treatments of human figurines may indicate that they were rep? resentations of ancestors. Despite their highly sche? matic and similar appearances, most Near Eastern Neolithic figurines probably represent individu? als (Pearson 1999:163). Neolithic and Chalcolithic figurines in the Balkans region of southeastern Europe (Bailey 1994) and Chalcolithic figurines in Cyprus (Knapp and Meskell 1997) show varia- tion in form and decoration that have been inter? preted as representing individuals. Hodder (2001) concludes that Near Eastern Neolithic figurines do not represent individuals because they do not have distinctive facial fea? tures. However, the ethnographic literature indi? cates that ancestors usually lose their individual- ity and are conceptualized as "faceless" (Kopytoff 1971:129), and that figurines used in ancestor ritu? als usually have schematic faces because their in? dividual attributes are instead summoned by call- ing their names (Newell 1976b: 20). Rather, the emphasized attributes of such figurines are those that indicate social roles ofthe deceased (Marcus 1998: 19, 25, ch. 6). Thus, the variation in hair- styles among the female figurines from Hacilar, with young women having pigtails, gathered plaits and coiled plaits, and older women having buns, is probably related to the age-related social iden- tities of women in that society. The intentional breakage of human figurines noted by many analysts may have been part of ancestor veneration rituals. Pearson (1999: 163) and Kuijt (2000) argue that decapitation of figu? rines had the same symbolism as post-mortem skull removal during the early Neolithic, and Rollefson (2000:168) suggests that breaking of human figu? rines represented "ritual death at the decease of the figurine's owner." However, as has been in- ferred for broken and defaced figurines from For- mative sites in Mesoamerica (Marcus 1998: 25), it seems more likely that these actions were in? tended to prevent people outside ofthe household from using the figurines to contact family ances? tors. The removed faces of large human represen? tations in plaster and stone relief may also repre? sent deliberate measures by lineages or communi? ties to prevent outsiders from invoking the pres? ence of their remote, deified ancestors, or they may represent the attempts of hostile outside groups to sever lineage or village connections with their pasts, and thereby their identities and territorial claims. In summary, figurines and other types of Neolithic human imagery (and possibly animal imagery) may be interpreted as related components of ritual material culture in the types of ancestor veneration cults that have been documented by anthropologists in many regions of the world. In Near Eastern Neolithic villages, as in neolithic/ formative communities around the world, the new importance of households andproperty inheritance encouraged the construction of ancestry, and the need to keep track of lineages led to the develop? ment ofthe female-domestic ritual sphere in which ancestor images were used to help remember ge- nealogies and propitiate and communicate with recent female ancestors. This interpretation is not unique; veneration of female ancestors through ceramic images made by women in each house? hold has been inferred for early farming village cultures in several other parts ofthe world (Chang 1983; Talalay 1991; Marcus 1998; Stinson 2003). The following section discusses some implications ofthe argument.</page><page sequence="114">106 JONATHAN B. MABRY DISCUSSION The likely reason that most neolithic/forma- tive human figurines around the world depict women is that they were mostly made and used by women (Lesure 2002). Ethnographically, human figurines used in ancestor rituals are typically made by women (Kems 1983: 2 and passim; Marcus 1998:4 and passim). Most human figurines at Near Eastern Neolithic sites are found in and around houses, often in association with hearths, and his? torical and ethnographic data show that these spaces are most commonly the domains of women (Hodder 1990). While female representations predominate, this does not necessarily mean, as has been inferred by some, that only women became ancestors and that Near Eastern Neolithic societies were matri- lineal (e.g., Pearson 1999: 163). In societies in which males dominated public rituals, deceased males may have been promoted preferentially to the status of remote ancestors and thus were sym- bolized differently in public ancestor rituals: "In a system in which deceased men move gradually toward the position of publicly honored (and re? mote) ancestors, the corpus of recent ancestors still honored in the household becomes increasingly female" (Marcus 1998: 21). That the figurines mostly depict mature women is probably because reaching maturity was necessary to achieve the proper status to become an ancestor. Indeed, depictions of pregnancy and childbirth are rare, depictions of women suckling infants are unknown and depictions of mature women with fat folds and sagging breasts are com? mon (Miller 2002). That depictions of women at earlier stages of life are less common may also be a reflection of typical ages of death. However, younger women probably died during childbirth frequently, so the rarity of depictions of pregnant or birthing women may be because women did not qualify for ancestorhood until later in life. No chil? dren or infants are portrayed except, rarely, as at- tachments to adult figures; likewise, this is prob? ably because children typically could not become ancestors (Pearson 1999: 163). One ofthe main functions of domestic ances? tor rituals using figurines was to symbolize and ensure the continuities of households. Figurines placed beneath or built into house walls, like buri? als and skulls placed beneath house floors, prob? ably represented continuity between former and present generations of households. Houses used for multiple generations that contained such sym? bols may themselves have come to symbolize an? cestors and lineages, thus making the domestic space sacred (and hence the difficulty archaeolo? gists have had in distinguishing houses and shrines at Neolithic sites). Finally, the distinction between recent and remote ancestors is important. Ethnographically, it is recent ancestors, conceptualized as elders still participating in the living community, that are typi- cally portray ed by small figurines used by women in domestic ancestor rituals (Marcus 1998: 4 and passim). Around the world, remote/deified ances? tors are less often portrayed with figurines and are more often honored by men in rituals performed in special buildings separated from residential ar? eas (Freedman 1970; McAnany 1995:13-14,33). Miller's (2002:232) passing suggestion that figu? rines at Sha'ar Hagolan represent deified ances? tors may apply better to the statue found at the site, a larger representation that was easily viewed by groups and which was probably the focus of public rituals. Likewise, the plaster statues and busts, the plaster statuettes used to support plas? tered skulls and the large human representations in plastered relief and on stone pillars may have been representations of remote or mythic ances? tors used in public rituals in courtyards, plazas and shrines. Rather than deities with dual aspects (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b: 11-12), the two- headed statues atc Ain Ghazal may be representa? tions of pairs of ancestors that symbolize the con- solidation of two or more related lineages during such public rituals (Rollefson 2000). In one ofthe few holistic attempts to interpret Neolithic symbolic systems in the Near East based on multiple lines of evidence, Verhoeven (2002: 245) identified four "structuring principles" of PPNB rituals and ideology: communality, domi? nant symbolism, vitality, and human-animal link- age. The interpretations presented here do not con- tradict those principles, but suggest that domes- ticity (in the sense of the household being a pri-</page><page sequence="115">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 107 mary setting for rituals and household members being the participants) and ancestor veneration be added to the list. That these additional structuring principles may have been at the core ofNear East? ern Neolithic symbolic systems can be illustrated when they are broken down into five related sym? bolic themes suggested by this study: 1) the pres? ence of ancestors in living households and com? munities; 2) places and properties inherited from ancestors; 3) continuity of households over gen- erations; 4) ancestral origins in mythic time; and 5) remote, mythic ancestors and animal totems (sometimes being the same) representing the ties between the multiple clans composing large com? munities. This interpretation also does not contradict structuralist models of Neolithic symbolism that view the arrangements of elements in the wall paintings at ?atal Hoyiik as being metaphors for kinship, with females being the links between lin- eages and being associated with both life and death (Forest 1994), or those that see a related set of oppositions goveming symbolic expressions in ar? chitecture and ritual material culture at ?atal Hoyiik and other Neolithic sites in the Near East and Southeast Europe: female/male, domestic/ wild, culture/nature, life/death, outer/inner parts of houses and figurines/masks (Hodder 1990: 10 and passim). CONCLUSIONS Based on archaeological patterns and ethno? graphic analogies, an interpretation of the mean? ing ofNear Eastern Neolithic human figurines has been proposed: A domestic ritual sphere main- tained by women used ceramic figurines. In ritu? als performed with some regularity in the house and general domestic space, women recalled spe? cific female ancestors with the aid of figurine rep? resentations as venues for the spirits to inhabit, and possibly by calling the names ofthe deceased to animate the figurines. These ancestors were probably the most recently deceased matriarchs in each lineage. At the ends ofthe rituals, the figu? rines were usually deliberately broken or defaced to prevent people outside ofthe households from having access to personal ancestors. Having served their function and lost their power of connection, the figurines were then casually discarded as do? mestic refuse. In other household rituals, figurine representations of ancestors were placed into or beneath house walls and floors to invoke their pres? ence and symbolize lineage continuity. Larger clay and stone figurines that were curated over mul? tiple generations may have depicted remote an? cestors, including male forebears. Figurine use was thus primarily concerned with invoking and consulting with recent, mostly female ancestors conceptualized as elders continu- ing to participate in the living household. Con- sciously or unconsciously, the motivation for main- taining this connection was ultimately economic. These household rituals reaffirmed continuity of lineages and thereby legitimized claims to heri- table private properties such as livestock herds, terraced fields, orchards and other subsistence in- frastructures that represent significant labor invest- ments with high values. This model supports suggestions that larger human representations were used in public rituals that, by reaffirming common ancestry (real or fic- tive), helped integrate multiple lineages residing together in villages (Kuijt 2000; Rollefson 2000). In contrast to figurines, these larger images prob? ably symbolized clan, community or cultural iden- tities. Participation in public rituals honoring shared, remote ancestors also would have rein- forced the rights of lineages in the village to ac? cess critical resources considered communal prop- erty (e.g., forests, pastures, irrigation water). The suggestion that two-headed statues were used in public rituals as symbols ofthe integration of two lineages or moieties (Rollefson 2000) may be sup? ported by the fact that two-headed figurines have not been found?they would not be expected to have been used in household rituals symbolizing the continuity of individual lineages. Here we can also envision how figurine mean? ings may have evolved in the ancient Near East. Cauvin's (1994, 2000a, 2000b) thesis about the origins of deities during the Neolithic may be es? sentially correct, but perhaps this turning point is marked by the appearance of large-scale, publicly viewed representations of remote ancestors dur? ing the late pre-pottery Neolithic (PPNB) instead</page><page sequence="116">108 JONATHAN B. MABRY of the earlier appearance of small, privately used representations of recent ancestors. Rather than suddenly appearing as spiritual entities alien and opposite to humans, gods and goddesses may have emerged over time by a gradual deification of in? creasingly remote and eventually mythic ances? tors. Pearson (1999: 165) dates the elevation of certain ancestors to the status of deities at about 3100 b.ce. in Egypt and 2500 b.c.e. in Mesopotamia by the appearance of large-scale rep? resentations, elaborate elite burials and monumen? tal commemorative architecture. In the Levant and southern Anatolia, however, this elevation may have occurred much earlier, in the PPNB period. "Although it would be going too far to see this as the origin of all individual divinities, one may ad- mit that some of them were originally only ances? tors and heroes, wrapped in legends, and slowly elevated to the status of deity" (Henninger 1981: 10). Probably because males increasingly con? trolled public ritual life, male deities whose iden- tities were rooted in remote or mythic ancestors from the Neolithic era became dominant in Bronze and Iron Age pantheons. In contrast, female dei? ties largely became conceptualized and publicly portrayed as subordinate wives or consorts ofthe male deities (cf. Dever 1984,1999), and figurines representing ancestors were used only in domes? tic rituals by women concerned with matters re? lated to maternity and family continuity (Meyers 2002). Rather than identifying Neolithic female figu? rines as representations of deities on the basis of the breast-holding gesture also depicted in Bronze and Iron Age "goddess" representations (Schmandt-Besserat 1998b), perhaps this gesture should be interpreted as symbolizing kinship, and we should see in it an evolutionary development from portrayals of recent female ancestors to de? pictions of remote or mythic female ancestors. The imagery of males riding bulls and females sitting on leopards in late Neolithic southern Anatolia may also have been symbols of the deified status of remote or mythic ancestors?symbols that spread into the Levant and eventually became the hall- marks of Canaanite deities. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The figurines in figures 1-3 were illustrated by Rob Ciaccio. In writing this article, the author benefited from many helpful comments on earlier drafts by Ian Kuijt, Linda Mabry, Susan Stinson and another anonymous reviewer. Conversations with Ted Banning and Carol Meyers yielded addi- tional insights. However, the author's interest in ancient Near Eastern symbolism can be traced back to the stimulating ideas of William Dever, who also passed on his loves of "dirt archaeology," teaching and fine scotch. NOTES 1. Date ranges for phases are expressed in uncalibrated radiocarbon years before present (b.p.), and are ap- proximate because they vary by region. The Pre-Pot? tery Neolithic C phase is limited to the southern Le? vant. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic/Pottery Neolithic boundary is shown as 8,000/7,500 b.p. because pot? tery appears by 8,000 b.p. (and possibly before 8,500 b.p.) in south-central Anatolia (Duru 1999), but not until ca. 7,500 b.p. in the southern Levant (Garfinkel 1999a). 2. PPNA, EPPNB, MPPNB, and LPPNB contexts are not differentiated for the seventy-five clay anthro? pomorphic figurines from ?ayonix (Broman Morales 1990: 57-75). 3. Among the total of "nearly fifty clay figurine frag? ments" at Gritille (Voigt 2000:265), the numbers of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic specimens are not differentiated. 4. With a height of 14 cm, this anthropomorphic stone "statuette" is larger than the 3-5 cm clay figurines from the site, and therefore may have a different meaning and function (Schmandt-Besserat 1998a). 5. The number of clay figurines found at ?atal Hoyiik is imprecise because some referred to in publications can not be located, and some fragments may or may not represent anthropomorphic figurines (Hamilton 1996). Not included in these totals are fifty-one larger anthropomorphic figures, some showing "humans"</page><page sequence="117">THE BIRTH OF THE ANCESTORS 109 with animals, made of clay (N=19) and stone (N=32; Voigt 2000: Table 5). 6. This total does not include incised stone slab figu? rines (N=4), incised clay slab figurines (N=2), and larger (7-24 cm) "statuettes" (N=l 16). 7. The total is reported as "nearly 100" (Duru 1999:178). 8. Other clay and stone figurine fragments are men? tioned, but no numbers or descriptions are given (Kaplan 1954). 9. This number does not include six fragments of a single larger (reconstructed 30-35 cm high) clay "statue" (Garfinkel et al. 2002: 190-93; figs. 13.1- 13.9. 10.

Archaeological and textual evidence suggests that this complexity affected all segments of the society. This article examines how economic complexity is re- flected in the pottery production a rural village, Tell el-Hayyat. It makes use of C Costin s (1991) method ofassessing degree of specialization by examining context, concentration, scale and intensity of production. The geographic distribution of pottery kilns suggests highly dis- persed production. The aggregation of kilns on sites where they are found suggests indepen- dent workshop production. The degree of standardization is assessed by examining the ce? ramic production in Tell el-Hayyat via changes over time in standard deviation and coefficient ofvariation. A decrease in standard deviation and coefficient ofvariation in hand-made and wheel-finished cooking pots indicates an increase in specialization during the Middle Bronze Age. Increase in specialization is also visible in the increase in skill of manipulating the clay into thinner and thinner vessel walls over time. This increased specialization is related to the growth in wealth ofthe community. The small size ofTell el-Hayyat suggests that either the community specialized in pottery production or mobile professional potters visited the village periodically to provide for the community s needs. Increasing social, political and economic com? plexity are hallmarks ofthe MiddleBronze Age in the southern Levant. Archaeological and tex? tual evidence suggests that this complexity affected all segments ofthe society. By examining the pres? ence of, and rationale for, specialized pottery pro? duction in a rural settlement, I hope to expand our understanding of the relationship between in? creased complexity and specialized production at the most basic level in this society. After the abandonment of towns in the Early Bronze IV Period (ca. 2300-2000 b.ce.), the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000-1550 b.ce.) is marked by a resurgence of fortified cities, strati? fied society, renewed international ties and increas? ingly complex, often warring, polities (Dever 1987; Ilan 1995). Although small in scale com? pared to the great empires and regional states in contemporary Syria, Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Egyptians believed Syro-Palestinian cities suffi- 117</page><page sequence="126">118 BONNIE MAGNESS-GARDINER ciently threatening to name them in the Execra- tion Texts, a set of magical incantations against Egypt's enemies (Posener 1971). In Syria, the king of Mari, a large state on the Euphrates, character? ized the king of Hazor, a site in northern Pales? tine, as head of one of the major military coali- tions in the Southern Levant. The few extant docu? ments give little information on the political economy. However, textual evidence reveals that in copper and tin for bronze tools and ornaments had to be imported and that the state appears to have played a significant role in long-distance exchange for those commodities (Malamat 1970). The distribution of finished products in gold and silver further suggests that these items played a role in a system of wealth finance that was just beginning to develop at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Analogy with contemporary king? doms in Syria suggests that the small polities of the southern Levant probably were financed through taxation on agricultural products and the working of state-owned estates (Magness-Gardiner 1994). The massive earthworks and fortification walls associated with the major sites ofthe south? ern Levant indicate that political elites also were able to mobilize labor for major projects (Finkelstein 1992). Differentiation in housing (Oren 1992) and in burials (Hallote 1995) in large towns and palatial centers reveal a new the dis? tinction between elites and commoners. Although most archaeological and historical investigations focus on the large, fortified settlements, surveys show that small villages and unwalled towns are an equally important component of the regional settlement pattern and the basic units of produc? tion in this agriculturally-based society (Falconer andSavage 1995). Tell el-Hayyat is one such village and archaeo? logical evidence from this village provides a win- dow on how specialized production in an increas? ingly complex Middle Bronze Age society mani- fests itself in a rural setting. Tell el-Hayyat is a small unfortified settlement located in the fertile agricultural lowlands of the Jordan Valley at ap? proximately 236 meters below sea level (fig. 1). Faunal, floral and ceramic data were recovered from the site during three field seasons between 1982 and 1985 (Falconer and Magness-Gardiner 1984,1989). Approximately 400 square meters of el Michal Afula jTell Aphek ? Gerisa lahal Sorek Tell el Hesi ?Tell el Ajjul Tell Ridan TejJ el Hayyat Fig. 1 Map ofthe Levant showing the location ofTell el-Hayyat and Middle Bronze Age sites with pottery kilns. the 1/2 ha surface area and 4.5 meters of cultural deposition at the mound's center were uncovered. All excavated sediments were sieved through one centimeter mesh, except intrusive debris in rodent holes and late period pits and burials. Four major phases of architecture represent continuous, peace- ful occupation during the Middle Bronze Age (Table 1). The most robust data is found in the first three major phases of Middle Bronze Age oc? cupation: Phase 5 (2000-1850 b.c.e.); Phase 4 (1850-1750 b.c.e.); and Phase3 (1750-1650 b.c.e.; fig. 2). The subsistence economy and institutional relations of the site within the larger region have already been investigated (Falconer 1995; Magness-Gardiner and Falconer 1994). In both cases the villagers exhibit a mixed response: they participate to a degree in larger regional econo- mies and institutions, but their participation is tem? pered by choices that indicate some desire for au- tonomy. Sheep and goat, for example, constitute the primary source of animal products for the site throughout its existence. The relative frequency of sheep to goat increases from 1:1 in Phase 5 (MB</page><page sequence="127">POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DEMAND IN A MB A LEVANTINE VILLAGE 119 a, Phase 5 (early MB II A) ? b.

Chronological Chart of Phases and Peri? ods at Tell el-Hayyat. Phase Period Date IIA) to 3:1 in Phase 3 (MB IIB). The stronger emphasis on sheep production presumably related to their marketable secondary products (Falconer 1995: 405). At the same time, however, pig pro? duction also increased. Unlike sheep and goats, pigs are ideally suited for domestic husbandry and household consumption: they are excellent scav- engers, produce multiple offspring and reach us- able age very rapidly (Zeder 1991: 30). Among plant remains, increased deposition of fruit taxa in relation to cereals perhaps reflects a greater exchange of high value agricultural products in line with a developing regional market economy (Falconer 1995). Craft specialization at the site is evidenced both by debris of metal working in the temple area and a single top-loading updraft kiln was uncov? ered on the south slope of the site outside the ar? eas of domestic occupation (Magness-Gardiner and Falconer 1994). Cut into the side ofthe natu? ral hill, the kiln is 1.5 meters long and 1.95 meters in height. Although smaller than the kilns at Afula and Aphek, the design and construction is similar (Kletter and Gorzalczany 2001). The debris re? moved from the kiln included a few wasters, but none indicative of vessel type or shape. Elsewhere on the site, however, wasters reveal that jars and large bowls were made locally. A study utilizing neutron activation analysis conducted by Steven Falconer (1987) found that some vessels in all classes of pottery (cooking vessels, storage ves? sels and serving vessels) were produced locally. The small size of the kiln and its placement out? side the domestic quarter argue for a small work? shop or independent specialist production on the site. Integration of the village with regional cul? tural institutions is represented in the successive temples dated to the Middle Bronze Age (fig. 2). Occupying a walled enclosure at the high point of the site, the form of the temple and nature of the associated debris reveal close cultural connections to temples at urban sites in Syria and the southern</page><page sequence="128">120 BONNIE MAGNESS-GARDINER Levant (Mazar 1992) and to ritual activities re? corded in texts from surrounding Syrian states. The local character of the building materials (mudbrick), the small scale ofthe building and the domestic nature of the containers for prescribed sacrifices and donations reveal the temple to be a local institution (Magness-Gardiner and Falconer 1994). Taken together these features suggest a good measure of autonomy and self-sufficiency for the village within the larger, politically and culturally integrated regional polity. Preliminary reports on excavations of other unwalled villages suggests that Tell el-Hayyat is not exceptional for its mixed farming economy (Horwitz 1989), the presence of a temple in a village site (Bunimowitz 1993; Gophna 1979; Eisenberg 1977) or the presence of a kiln (Kletter and Gorzalczany 2001). METHOD How do we identity specialization, assess its degree, and evaluate change over time in relation to political and economic development in the same region? Our initial assessment is based on identi? fication of different production techniques (hand- building, wheel-thrown, kiln or open pit firing) that are indicative of greater or lesser degrees of spe? cialization. The investment in materials and skill necessary to use a wheel effectively and to build and control firing temperatures in a kiln imply a level of commitment to production of pottery be? yond that of simple household production (Pea? cock 1982: 8-11). Prior to the beginning ofthe Middle Bronze Age, most pottery was hand- formed and only the rims of some jars and small bowls were finished on a tournette or slow wheel. It is only with the Middle Bronze Age that pottery produced on a fast-wheel becomes the norm (Amiran and Shenhav 1984). The predominance of wheel-made pottery and the number of kilns imply a degree of specialization not present in the preceding period. However, the mere existance of kilns and wheel-thrown pottery will not support an assessment of socio-economic location of pro? duction and the relationship of potters to the con- sumers of their wares. Costin provides the most usable method for identifying the presence and degree of specializa- tion in a given cultural setting (1991: 8-9). She identifies four elements of production (context, concentration, scale and intensity) that provide insight on the degree specialization (1991:11-16). Context describes the market relationship between producer and consumer. Attached production is at one end ofa continuum. Sponsored and managed by ruling elites, government institutions or patrons, attached specialists tend to produce a limited range of goods often focusing on luxury items or weap? ons. Independent production is at the other end of the continuum. Producing for a general market, independent specialists tend to produce a wide range of goods, often utilitarian items. Concentra? tion desribes the distribution of specialists across the landscape and their spatial relationship to one another and their consumers. Specialists gathered in close proximity in a central location with an established market have the advantage of having their consumers travel to them. Specialists spread evenly across the landscape may have less access to a variety of consumers and more transportation costs. Scale describes the size and composition of the production unit. Composition refers to the means of recruiting specialists into the unit. At one extreme is the individual or family-based unit, at the other extreme is the wage-labor system of com? plex, industrial economies. Independent special? ists tend to be small in size and family-oriented, attached specialists tend to be organized into larger groups. Intensity refers to the amount of time pro- ducers spend on their craft. Casual, part-time pro? duction is at one end of the continuum and fiill- time specialization is at the other. Efficiency, risk and scheduling effect the intensity of production. The ability to "mass produce," the degree of capi? tal investment necessary to set up a production line and the required degree of training for production effect efficiency. It is, for example, more effieient to take the time to train a few highly skilled pro- ducers and have them work full-time than to have highly skilled specialists work part-time. Risk tends to be minimized by independent specialists by combining craft production with food produc? tion and thus working only part-time at their craft. Scheduling is also a factor in craft production, particularly when the independent specialist also pursues agricultural activities. Attached special-</page><page sequence="129">POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DEM AND IN A MB A LEVANTINE VILLAGE 121 ists tend to work full-time because they are often supported by their patrons. Costin's method provides a fruitful means of approaching specialization in ceramic production in the Middle Bronze Age ofthe Levant. Here the discussion will focus on 1) context and concen? tration, as they are amenable to investigation of the direct evidence for production; and 2) scale and intensity, as they are only amenable to inves? tigation via indirect evidence of production. Context and Concentration As Costin points out, the context of special? ization is best understood at the local level (1991: 25). Attached and independent specialists in a com? munity can be distinguished by the location of pro? duction activities in relation to other domestic and institutional features on the site. At the extreme ends of the spectrum, we expect the independent specialists to work out of their houses while the attached specialists will practice their trade within the physical limits ofthe institution that employs them. Thus the association of production facili? ties with specific architectural and institutional features are the only secure way to characterize context (Costin 1991: 26). Concentration, on the other hand, measures the relative nucleation or dispersal of units of production over a geographi? cal area. This requires a regional approach. Nucle- ated production is said to occur when debris is lim? ited to few sites within the region and dispersed production is said to occur when production de? bris is found in uniform distribution throughout the region (Costin 1991: 27). There is a substantial amount of direct evi? dence for context, concentration and distribution of kilns and production debris in the Middle Bronze Age Levant published by Kletter and Gorzalczany (2001). Kletter and Gorzalczany iden? tity twenty-three kilns that are recorded at a total of sixteen sites in the Middle Bronze Age south? ern Levant. These include kilns at regional capi? tals (Tell Aphek, Tell el-Ajjul), small fortified towns (Tell Gerisa, Afula, Tel Michal, Tell Ridan), and small, unfortified villages (Nahal Soreq and Tell el-Hayyat). Although the other sites with kilns have not been sufficiently excavated to be charac- terized as to size and function, it seems clear that pottery production was not restricted to large, ur? ban centers. Moreover, on sites where there are more than one kiln, they are found grouped to? gether (Aphek, Afula, Tel Michal, Ramat Aviv, Abattoir Hill, Jaffa, Nahal Soreq; Kletter and Gorzalczany 2001). Kilns also are often found just outside the settlement proper, away from domes? tic or institutional buildings, as at Aphek (Kochavi 1993), Tell el-Hayyat (Falconer and Magness- Gardiner 1989) and Ramat Aviv (Kletter and Gorzalczany 2001: 97). The aggregation of kilns and their separation from both households and institutions suggest that these were either independent artisans or only un? der very indirect institutional supervision. The presence of kilns in a variety of locations through? out the region and at a variety of site sizes and types suggests the concentration of production is highly dispersed throughout the region. This dis? tribution of pattern for production sites in the Middle Bronze Age Levant is consistent with geo? graphical distribution and mode of production of utilitarian pottery production in other complex, agrarian societies (Brumfiel 1987; Tosi 1984; Sinopoli 1988). It must be noted that in the Late Bronze Age at Ugarit, the control of the palace extends well into the country-side, where attached specialists, including potters, work on estates belonging to the king and other aristocratics (Heltzer 1982). There is no evidence to suggest, however, that this model operated in the Middle Bronze Age of the south? ern Levant. Scale and Intensity Scale refers to the composition (size and source of labor force) of the production unit and intensity refers to the amount of time producers spend on their craft (Costin 1991:15-17). The size ofthe production unit is inferred from the size of the production facility (Costin 1991: 29). The di- rect evidence of kiln location and number noted above suggests that workshop or independent spe? cialist production exists in proportion to the size ofthe settlement in which the production facility exists. The precise number of potters at work in</page><page sequence="130">122 BONNIE MAGNESS-GARDINER any single location, of course, is beyond our de? termination. The characterization of labor force is even more difficult to achieve. We simply do not have enough production debris to evaluate the source ofthe labor force or its relationship to the surrounding community. Intensity reflects the amount of time and de? gree of commitment of an individual or group to craft activities and it is measured in efficiency, skill, risk and scheduling (Costin 1991: 16). Risk and scheduling cannot be examined with the evi? dence at hand. Indeed, it would be difficult to measure these factors with virtually any archaeo? logical collection. Efficiency, however, is ame? nable to indirect assessment through measures of standardization and skill in the manipulation of materials (Costin 1991: 35-37). Standardization Standardization is the "relative degree of ho- mogeneity or reduction in variability in the char? acteristics ofthe pottery or the process of achiev- ing that relative homogeneity" (Rice 1991: 268). A host of articles have appeared in recent years discussing the methods, value and hazards of us? ing standardization as a means of establishing dif? ferent degrees of specialization (Benco 1988; Blackman, Stein and Vandiver 1993; Eerkens and Bettinger 2001). Ethnographic studies of standard? ization (Longacre, Kvamme and Kobayashi 1988; London 1991; Arnold and Nieves 1992; Longacre 1999) indicate that professional potters do indeed produce vessels that have a lesser degree of vari? ability (in paste composition, shape and size) than non-professional potters in the same society. How? ever, Longacre, Kvamme and Kobayashi state that the identification of specialist production through metric analysis of archaeologically derived col- lections will be uncertain if the culturally consti- tuted groupings of pottery have not been identi? fied correctly (1988: 107). In communities with either household or specialist production, twice the number of recognized size classes were present than could be accounted for through metric analy? sis alone. In archaeological contexts, the problem of correct classification of size categories is even more difficult since in many cases the vessels are present only a sherds. Furthermore, Blackman, Stein and Vandiver (1993) note that a long longi- tudinal time frame for an archaeological collec? tion results in cumulative blurring due to the ef- fects of multiple producers and production events on site over time. Despite these drawbacks, met- ric measures of standardization are often the only method of establishing a relative degree ofvaria? tion, and thus specialization, in an archaeological setting. Provided that the collections come from similar types of deposits or events within the same culture (Arnold and Nieves 1992), then the rela? tive degree of standardization should be accessible even though the culturally relevant groupings are not archaeologically accessible. It is not possible to look at degrees of stan? dardization at each of the production sites dis? cussed above: Too little ofthe materials from the kiln sites have been published to make that a vi- able option. It is possible to examine the ceramic output from the village of Tell el-Hayyat in the period between the earliest MB IIA (Phase 5, ca. 2000 b.ce.) through the end ofthe MB IIB period (Phase 3, ca. 1650 b.ce.) and in doing so compare the relative degree of specialization as it changed over time. Standardization is assessed in changes in standard deviation, the coefficient of variation of cooking pot rim diameter and vessel wall thick? ness over time. Standard deviation (SD) is the de? viation from the mean in each sample of object (here a cooking pot type from a single period con- stitutes the sample). It describes variability in a single sample very well, but cannot be used to compare variability across samples. The coeffi? cient ofvariation (CV) expresses the standard de? viation as a percentage of the mean and thus al- lows comparison over time or across classes. Thus, the lower the percentage coefficient of variation, the greater the degree of standardization. Eerkens and Bettinger (2001: 494) argue in a recent analy? sis of techniques for assessing standardization that a coefficient ofvariation, in particular, is in most cases a stable and reliable measure of variation. Arnold and Nieves (1992: 107) point out that the coefficient ofvariation does not assess the signifi? cance of variability. They recommend the use of</page><page sequence="131">POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DEMAND IN A MBA LEVANTINE VILLAGE 123 c. =^ f. *\ g.

(Drafting by Steven Falconer, Bonnie Magness-Gardiner, Jennifer Jones and Glen Peterman.) the F-ratio to compare variances. The F-ratio is calculated by dividing the larger variance by the smaller one. If the P-value is less than the conven- tional 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the conclusion is that the two variances do indeed dif- fer significantly. Cooking pots present the best test case because they are most likely of all pottery vessels to be produced exclusively on site and their function is unambiguous. Cooking pots at Tell el-Hayyat come in two varieties: 1) hand-made, flat-bottom, open vessels (fig. 3a) and 2) wheel-finished, round-bot- tom, closed-mouth vessels (figs. 3b-c). As tech? niques of production are often a good measure of specialist produced crafts, the selection of these two cooking pots, one likely to be a product of sporadic household production, and the other likely to be professionally made by specialists, seemed particularly fortuitous. Broad contemporaneity was ensured by selecting sherds from good use depos- its (surface buildup, floors, pits and ash lenses) within each phase. Although it would have been preferable to conduct this study with whole ves? sels on which multiple measurements could be taken, only one whole cooking pot was retrieved during the excavation ofthe site. Table 2 illustrates a decrease over time in the coefficient of variation (CV) of rim diameter of both cooking pot types but an increase in CV of wheel-finished cooking pots. The decrease in CV of rim diameter in wheel-finished cooking pots is particularly striking and perhaps what we would expect in products of artisans whose craft becomes more routinized and less variable over time as they achieve more efficiency. Now, in comparison with the CV's calculated from data collected from pro? fessional and non-professional potters in the Phil- ippines (Longacre, Kvamme andKobayashi 1988), a CV of .22 is almost double that attributed to non- professional potters. However, as there are no clear</page><page sequence="132">124 BONNIE MAGNESS-GARDINER Table 2. Cooking Pot Rim Diameter and Body Thickness in cm. A. Flat-Bottom, Open Mouth, Hand-made Cooking Pot Body Thickness Mean SD CV N B. Round-Bottom, Necked, Closed Mouth, Wheel-finished Cooking Pot size classes discernible from the sherd materials at Tell el-Hayyat, I have lumped the entire body of data into a single group with the assumption that the cumulative variability (or lack thereof) would be apparent when the same grouping from each chronological/stratigraphic phase was com? pared to each other. In any case, there is a decrease in SD and CV that suggests an increase in special? ization in both hand-made and wheel-finished cooking pots during the course of the Middle Bronze Age. Skill Skill in the manipulation of raw materials is also an indirect measure of scale and intensity of production in that it represents the amount of time devoted to learning and practicing the motor skills and judgement necessary to produce pots effi- ciently (Costin 1991: 39-40). Hagstrum, for ex? ample, argues that the more uniform firing of Inka pottery indicates more highly skilled and more highly specialized artisans (Costin 1991:40). Here I suggest that increasing skill in forming and fir? ing clay is manifested in the increasingly thin walls in those classes of vessels made by specialists. In cooking pots, there are constraints of mechanical strength and resistance to thermal shock to be con? sidered when judging body thickness and indeed, it is the class of vessel that shows the least amount of change over time (Table 3). Storage vessels decrease almost .25 cm in thickness and serving vessels decrease almost .5 cm in body thickness. Certainly these figures show that potters were in? creasingly skillful at manipulating clay, and per? haps manipulating consumers at the same time. Lighter, finer vessels were undoubtedly more de- sirable than heavy ones, but they were undoubt? edly also more breakable than vessels with thicker walls and therefore replaced with greater frequency (and more profit to the potter.) As for the standard deviation study above, the samples were selected from good secondary deposits on the site and there? fore are reasonably contemporary.</page><page sequence="133">POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DEMAND IN A MB A LEVANTINE VILLAGE 125 Table 3. Average Body Thickness in cm. Phase Cooking Vessels N Storage Vessels N Serving Vessels N Table 4. Diversity in Vessel Shape and Rim Treatment. The number before the slash refers to the number of forms (F) or variety of vessel shapes in a particular functional category, and the number following the slash refers to the variety of rim treatments (R) within the functional category. For example, there are three forms of body shape in cooking pots: 1) wide-mouth, flat-bottom; 2) con- stricted-neck, closed-mouth, round-bottom; and 3) neck-less, closed-mouth, round-bottom vessels. In these three form categories of cooking pots there are up to 15 different rim treatments. N = number of vessels in the sample. A. Site-wide Cooking Vessels Storage Vessels Serving Vessels Phase F/R N F/R N F/R N Formal Variability The increasing skill demonstrated in control over vessel wall thickness together with the in? creasing standardization evidenced in rim diam? eter indicates increasingly specialized production. The direct evidence ofthe kiln, located away from domestic quarters but on the site, suggests a work? shop or individual specialist. With greater special? ization, one might expect a lesser degree of vari? ability in form as well as size (rim diameter) and quality (vessel body thickness) of output in order to enhance the efficiency of the operation (Rice 1991: 273). Table 4a illustrates the number of ba- sic body forms and the number of distinct rim treat? ments in each ofthe functional classes of pottery for each of the three phases of occupation under consideration. None shows the expected decline in variability. Variability in cooking pot and stor? age jar rim treatments are more or less stable over time while serving vessels increase somewhat in the number of both body shapes and in rim treat? ments. It seems that serving vessels are the focus of both skill (in producing thinner, finer vessels) and variety (in producing a greater number of forms and rim treatments). Two reasons for this come to mind. First, serving vessels are most likely to be seen by neighbors and outsiders and there-</page><page sequence="134">126 BONNIE MAGNESS-GARDINER fore an appropriate medium to convey social in? formation (Wobst 1977). Second, citing Mesoamerican examples, Costin explains the eco? nomic basis for a trend toward elaboration by sug? gesting that "weakly specialized economies will be marked by greater competition, which leads to greater energy expenditure in the form of product elaboration as specialists try to differentiate their wares from the products of their competitors and thereby attract customers" (1991: 37). At Tell el- Hayyat, perhaps the social need to convey status information coincided with the economic need of the potters to attract customers. Table 4a illustrates the variety of production over time for the site as a whole. However, as the site is divided into two functional quarters, do? mestic and temple, the distribution of forms in the two sectors and the relative change over time may tell us something about the source of demand for formal variability. Table 4b reveals that the pot? tery deposited in the temple is a simple subset of the pottery in the domestic areas?that is, the temple deposits have the same or fewer number of forms and rim treatments than the domestic deposits. One would expect greater variability within the temple deposits if ritual requirements dictated distinct forms. Thus it would appear that demand for increasingly varied set of serving ves? sels is not a result of ritual requirements or insti? tutional support of potters by the temple but rather the result of some site-wide phenomenon. The vil? lage as a whole shows an increase in wealth in the size, construction materials and elaboration of both domestic and temple buildings over time (fig. 2). The increase in the consumption of serving ves? sels, diversity of selection (Table 4a) and fineness of ware (Table 3) fits into this pattern. It would seem that greater amounts of disposable wealth, probably derived from agricultural production, led to increased demand for items that could mark the status accorded to wealth in this society. CONCLUSION Direct evidence for production facilities on the regional and local scale indicate that aggre- gates of individual specialists or workshops oc? curred at a wide variety of sites. The context of production suggests that they were independent of institutions and probably served the general population. Indirect evidence ofthe products them? selves illustrates a demand for increasingly fine and variable forms of serving (and other) vessels at a small village. This further suggests that arti- sans produced wares for the rural as well as the urban population. Participation in a specialized craft economy was not, therefore, limited to ad? ministrative institutions, market centers or elites. However, it is still hard to imagine that a village of 1/2 hectare and a population of 100-150 could support even one resident full-time potter, let alone an entire workshop, despite the evidence that most of the vessels were produced by specialists and consumed on site (Falconer 1987: 310). There are two alternatives to consider: com? munity specialization (i.e., production at Hayyat for the surrounding communities) or mobile pot? ters. Village-based specialization occurs in the eth- nographic record when a village has special ac? cess to a desirable raw material but not to arable land (Stark 1991). That scenario seems unlikely at Tell el-Hayyat, as it has immediate access to arable land and no known access to special clays. The number and distribution of kilns in a wide variety of small and large sites in and around Tel Aviv also seems to suggest that single sites did not specialize in pottery production in this period (Kletter and Gorzalczany 2001). Alternatively, the village might be served by specialist potters that travel from place to place producing for a variety of communities on demand. Ethnographic ex? amples have been recorded on Cyprus (London 1989) and in Yugoslavia and Ethiopia (Nicklin 1979: 444). Texts from Syrian archives also tes- tify to mobility among craftsmen of other types of objects during this period (Zaccagnini 1983). Trav- eling potters might also be a good explanation for the inter-regional homogeneity of style in form and decoration of pottery vessels during this period (Amiran 1970; Cole 1984). What are the implications of independent spe? cialist, workshop production in a hinterland vil? lage? Elsewhere I have argued that where absen- tee ownership ofa village and its surrounding land occurred, the owners (whether palace, temple or town-based elite) would have had the right to all</page><page sequence="135">POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DEMAND IN A MB A LEVANTINE VILLAGE 127 surplus production and the village inhabitants would have been kept at a subsistence-level exist? ence and where community or individual owner- ship of land was present, the local inhabitants would have had the rights to the surplus produc? tion and would have had a chance to accumulate (or invest) that surplus as they desired (Magness- Gardiner 1994). The evidence here suggests that sufficient surplus is present in the village to sup? port one or more non-farming members ofthe com? munity and thus I would argue that we have local ownership of land and local right to dispose of any surplus as well as the growth of surplus (wealth) overtime. This is also consistent with the increasing size and complexity of buildings on the site during the Middle Bronze Age (Magness- Gardiner and Falconer 1994). Economic growth during this period of in? creasing regional social and political complexity clearly was not restricted to urban centers and elites. Villages participated and benefited from regional developments, although, it appears, very much on their own terms.

According to the Bible, much ofthe Galilee came under Israelite control in consequence of great battles led by Joshua and Deborah, but this telling ofthe story is not historically reliable. The Galilee, controlled by Canaanite city-states in the Late Bronze Age, was home to many small villages in the Iron I As in the Central Highlands, most of these villages appeared suddenly, founded, it would seem, by refugeesfrom the chaotic events ofthe LB/Iron I transitional years. What were these villages like, and can they be considered Israelite? The paper reviews important Galilean settlements ofthe Iron I and concludes that the term Israelite is best reservedfor the inhabit? ants ofthe Iron II Galilee. This paper considers one ofthe most inter? esting problems in Biblical Archaeology, that of the Israelite settlement of the Gali? lee. It is fitting to dedicate it to William G Dever, who once predicted the death of Biblical Archae? ology and later became the midwife of its rebirth.1 The nature ofthe Israelite settlement in Canaan has challenged scholars for a century and more, particularly since the Bible contains conflicting views of Israelite origins. Some have used archae? ology to "prove" the biblical narrative ofthe Isra? elite conquest of Canaan; others, to "prove" that there was not even an entity called Israel during the Iron I. Many intermediary permutations have also been explored. Surveys and excavations in the mountainous Central Highlands (biblical Manasseh and Ephraim), the Judaean Hills fur? ther south (biblical Benjamin and Judah), the Negev and the Galilee have resulted in the identi? fication of several hundred farmsteads, hamlets and villages.2 Founded in relatively unoccupied areas, they incorporated those features necessary for self-sufficient small-scale farmers and herders. The importance of these settlements is two- fold. First of all, they provided the locus of the LB-Iron Age transition. As M. Kochavi noted, "The real revolution [between the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age] took place not in the cities, but in the pattern of settlement in the countryside" (1985: 55). The second matter relates specifically to the Central Highlands. Since this region would become the core of Iron II Israel, the identity of its Iron I inhabitants is understood as fundamental to the question of Israelite origins and ethnicity and has been subjected to a rather lengthy debate. Ar? eas that are at some distance from the Highland center have not been as well integrated into the discussion about the beginnings of Israelite settle? ment. This paper focuses on the mountainous Ga? lilee, Israel's northernmost region. The Galilee is 131</page><page sequence="139">132 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI often cited in discussions of Israelite origins, due to the seeming fit between the biblical narrative and the Iron I strata at Hazor and Dan. Overall, though, insufficient attention has been paid to the region, due to limited excavations and to the fo- cus on Iron I sites farther south. Fortunately, a number of recent publications provide the re? sources necessary to better explore this important geographic zone.3 This paper examines that part ofthe Galilee, which would later be incorporated into Iron II Israel; Phoenician and Aramaean sites are not included in the discussion. It then ques? tions the identity of its Iron I inhabitants. Were they Israelite, as the Bible claims or alternately, is the term Israelite best reserved for their Iron II successors? ISRAELITE ORIGINS Who were the Israelites, and how did they come to live in their Promised Land? The Bible presents different perspectives: a lineage through Abraham and an experience of slavery and exo- dus from Egypt shared by all Israel (Genesis- Deuteronomy); an efficient military conquest eradicating virtually all the indigenous peoples of Canaan (Joshua); and coexistence between Canaan and Israel marred by occasional periods of con- flict (Judges). Iron I settlers known from ancient texts (including the Bible) and from the archaeo? logical record include Canaanites and Amorites, Egyptians, Sea Peoples (especially Philistines), Hittites, Jebusites, Girgashites, Perrizites and Hivites, capiru and shasu and Israelites.4 Too of? ten, neither their precise origins nor their ultimate destination is fully apparent. The confusion expe? rienced by modern interpreters replicates that of the Iron II authors of the Bible, who repeatedly described an amalgam of peoples throughout the region (Ex 13:5,33:2; Deut 20:17; Josh 12:8; Judg 3:5, Ezek 16:3, 45-46; inter alia), and who, as noted above, presented a conflicted view of how these peoples came to settle in the Promised Land. Most twentieth century discussions ofthe Is? raelite Settlement relied upon three models.5 Alt and Noth's hypothesis of Peaceful Infiltration sug? gested that Israelites were not foreign invaders, but rather pastoral nomads in the process of set- tling down throughout the centuries of the Iron I (Noth 1960; Alt 1967).6 Albright's Conquest Hy? pothesis claimed that archaeologically attested de- structions at Hazor and elsewhere validate the Joshua description of an Israelite military cam? paign against the cities of Canaan (Albright 1940, 1954).7 The Peasants' Revolt model presents Is? rael as a community of social outlaws who re- sponded to inequities within the Canaanite world by withdrawing from their native city-states (Mendenhall 1962; Gottwald 1979). More recent studies emphasize cultural evolution, i.e., the change from segmentary society to chiefdom to state (Frick 1985; Meyers 2001), the impact ofthe Egyptian occupation in Late Bronze Age Canaan (Bunimovitz 1994), enclosed nomadism (Fritz 1981), demographic change (Sharon 1994) and more. Dever has emphasized a Proto-Israelite "na- scent ethnic identity" that was part of a "diverse yet increasingly focussed socio-economic and ideological movement, born out ofthe collapse of the Late Bronze Age civilizations of Canaan and the Levant" (1998: 232; see also Dever 2003 and references therein). It may not be possible to establish a single overarching explanation for the complex process of settlement throughout the two centuries of the Iron I. Drought and famine, the breakdown of western Asian and Mediterranean commercial markets, population movements and the concomi- tant military and socio-economic consequences, the destabilization of the Egyptian Empire in Canaan and more, all contributed to the movement of peoples throughout the region (Dever 1992; Bloch-Smith and Nakhai 1999: 115). In addition, the difficulties presented by hypotheses that se- lect and discard data according to intellectual or ideological criteria (Halpern 1983: 48-49; Hess 1993: 139; Silberman 1998) have long been rec? ognized. These caveats become important when viewing the Iron I from the perspective ofthe Ga? lilee. THE GALILEE Major geographic features subdivide the rocky Galilee (fig.

The Upper Galilee, Israel's northernmost? and Lebanon's southernmost?region, is rugged and heavily forested, making passage difficult but refuge easy (Baly 1957: 192). It is a mountainous region extending from the Beth Hakerem Valley in the south to the Litani River Valley in the north; few valleys lie between them. The Lower Galilee is transected by four east-west mountain ranges, the southernmost of which, the Nazareth Hills, creates the Galilee's southern border. Three wide intermontane valleys separate these ranges, pro- viding fertile farmland and facilitating communi? cation. Of all the Galilean valleys, the largest is the southernmost, the Beth Netofah. The Plain of Akko borders the western edge ofthe Galilee while the Jordan Valley marks its eastern extremity (Amiran 1956; Aharoni 1967: 25-26; Orni and Efrat 1973: 73-79; Frankel 1992: 879-81; Gal 1993). In antiquity, north-south passage though the heartland of the Galilee was difficult. Longitudi- nal roads ran along the Mediterranean coast and</page><page sequence="141">134 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI through the Jordan Valley. East-west roads across the broad Jezreel Valley, just below the southern? most mountains of the Galilee, connected the north-south roads at several points and allowed for passage from the Coastal Plain to the Beth Shan and Jordan Valleys and onward into Jordan and Syria. Farther north, east-west passage followed the highway known in Ottoman times as the Darb el-Hawarneh. This road passed through the Yavne'el and Beth Netofah Valleys and connected Transjordan with the Akko Plain. Lateral roads also connected Akko, Jokneam and Megiddo with Hannaton, the largest Bronze Age site in the Lower Galilee, and Akko with the Jordan Valley and with Tel Ros. Farther north, they connected Nahariya with Hazor, and Achzib with 'Abel-Beth-Ma'acah, the Jordan Valley, and so forth (Dorsey 1991; see also Saarisalo 1927:22-26; Aharoni 1967: 56-57; Oded 1971; Ilan 1981; Gal 1992: 8-10; Dessel 1999: 10,n.40). Biblical Views on the Israelite Settlement ofthe Galilee The Bible is vague about the Galilee's precise borders, using the term "Galilee" to refer to the land north ofthe hills of Manasseh. Although geo? graphic factors lead modern scholars to differen- tiate between the Upper and the Lower Galilee, the Bible makes no such distinction. Topography proves essential for determining the settlement pattern of the Galilean tribes, since tribal allot- ments were made according to natural geographic boundaries, disagreements about their precise lines notwithstanding (Meyers 1983:48; Frankel 1994: 879-81). In its description of tribal allotments (Josh 13-19), the Bible delineates the borders of the Galilean tribes (Josh 19:10-48), placing Isra? elites in the mountains and in some intermontane valleys (fig. 2).9 It locates Canaanites, Phoenicians and Sea Peoples in unconquered cities and dis- tricts from the northernmost Galilee to the low? lands, the Jezreel, Beth Shan and Jordan Valleys and the Akko Plain (Josh 17:11-13; Judg 1:27- 35; Malamat 1979; Frankel 1992: 885; Frankel et al. 2001: 141-50). The Upper Galilee east ofthe Jordan River was allocated to the tribe of Dan. West of the Jordan, the territory once controlled by Hazor was given to Naphtali. The territory of Asher abutted the Mediterranean coast, in the re? gion once controlled by Akko. The Zebulun clans settled in the western Lower Galilee and the tribe of Issachar settled in the eastern Lower Galilee and in the Jezreel Valley (Gal 1985; 1994: 43-45; Frankel 1994; Meyers 1983: n. 4). Some scholars place the origin (but not the final composition) of the tribal boundary system in the premonarchic period (Meyers 1983: 52, 1996: 16) or in the era ofthe Divided Monarchy (Frankel 1992: 885). Most, however, place Josh 13-19 in the United Monarchy, reflecting tenth century territorial divisions (Gottwald 1979: 155? 63; Kallai 1986:279-93,1997; Gal 1992:96-106; Gal and Alexandre 2000: 196-97; Frankel et al. 2001: 105). It may have originated as a boundary system created to support the Davidic census or the Solomonic corvee (Na'aman 1986, 1994; see also Weinfeld 1986: 272-73). Eventually, the im? age of "all-Israel" created by this tribal boundary system became central to the biblical vision of Is? rael, describing the ideal (but not the real) past.10 The Bible recounts early and epic clashes be? tween Israelites and Canaanites in the Galilee and as far south as the Jezreel Valley. Many scholars posit an historical basis for the story of Dan's mi? gration to the city of Laish (Josh 19:40-48; Judg 1:34; Judg 18; see Biran 1994a: 125-35; 1994b: 4-5; Frankel 1994; Na'aman 1994: 270-73 and references therein) but they are less certain about Joshua's battles against a coalition of Canaanites at the Waters of Merom (Josh 11:1-9) and at Hazor (Josh 11:10-15; NaDaman 1994: 256-59, 268-69 and references therein; also see Frankel et al. 2001: 150; Yadin 1972: 132). The Bible places Deborah and Barak's battle against a coalition of Canaanites at the border between the Galilean mountains and the Jezreel and Beth Shan Valleys, at Mt. Tabor (Judg 4:14) or perhaps at Tacanach (Judg 5:19; see Gal 1994: 43-45 and references therein). At? tempts to verify the historicity of these Conquest narratives seem misplaced, given their ideologi? cal and sometimes aetiological function. They serve to provide an explanation for Israel's pres? ence at sites throughout the land rather than docu? mentation of actual historical events.</page><page sequence="142">ISRAEL ON THE HORIZON: THE IRON I SETTLEMENT OF THE GALILEE 135 cAbel Beth* Ma'acah H. cAvot T.

Archaeological Evidence for the Iron I Settlement ofthe Galilee: The Upper Galilee (fig. 2)" Aharoni's 1950s survey ofthe Israeli Upper Galilee identified Bronze Age sites in the north? ern sector. Farther south, it identified Iron Age sites and attributed their presence to the slow penetra- tion of Israelites, as described by Alt and Noth. In Aharoni's opinion, Israelite success threatened Canaanites living in the north, resulting in the monumental battle at Merom under Jabin of Hazor (Aharoni 1957: 146-19; 1967: 176-77, 207-8).12 Recent surveys and excavations have corrected Aharoni's identifications, revealing that there were only fourteen Late Bronze Age sites in the Upper Galilee, down from fifty-two in the MB II. Of these, the most important were Tel Dan, Hazor, Tel Ros,13 and cAbel-Beth-Ma5acah. Ofthe sev- enty-one Iron I sites, sixty-two were newly founded in the late twelfth or eleventh centuries.14 The Iron II witnessed another major shift in the settlement pattern ofthe Upper Galilee, as the number of sites dropped substantially to thirty-six (Frankel et al. 2001: 104-7, 126-28; see also Kochavi 1985; Finkelstein 1988: 97-110; Gal 1988-89; Frankel 1994; Lehmann 2001: 74-75).</page><page sequence="143">136 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI The Iron I sites were not distributed evenly across the landscape. Rather, they clustered in ways that reveal vestiges of Late Bronze Age re- gionalism, when the city-states of Tyre, Akko and Hazor had dominated the north (Gal 1992: 62; Frankel et al. 2001:106; Lehmann 2001: 83-87).15 Tyre ofthe Iron Age is not well known (Ward 1994: 75). The material culture remains from sites nearby (Tel Ros, Horvat cAvot, Kibbutz Sasa, Hurvat Yavnit, Tel Harasim, and Har Adir), known pri? marily from surveys, reveal evidence of both Tyrian/Phoenician and local ties (Gal 1988-89: 83; 1993; Braun 1993).16 Tel Kabri,17 Har Hagamal, and many small villages were located in the terri? tory once governed by Akko on the Mediterranean and by Hazor in the Jordan Valley (Frankel 1994: 32-33; Frankel et al. 2001: 104-7). The matter ofthe origins of their Iron I popula? tions is complex. Late Bronze Age prototypes for Iron I pots suggest indigenous roots for the tribe of Asher, known from early thirteenth century texts (Edelman 1992) and located in the territory once controlled by Akko, as well as for Naphtali, in the territory once controlled by Hazor (Frankel 1994; Frankel et al. 2001: 106; cf. Ben-Ami 2001: 158- 65). At the same time, Sea Peoples settled in and around Akko, living among its native population (M. Dothan 1993: 21; Lehmann 2001: 89) and some southerners moved north to Dan (Biran 1989; Yellin and Gunneweg 1989).18 According to Rainey, some immigrants to the Upper Galilee may have come from "the Syrian desert or from Hauran"(2001:75). Hazor. Hazor was among the most important of the Late Bronze Age city-states, as evidenced by its extraordinary size (192 acres), its mention in Amarna Letters 148, 227 and 364, and its title "head of all those kingdoms" (Joshll: 10). In ar? chaeological parlance, the thirteenth century de? struction of Hazor (Stratum XIII=Stratum IA) marks the Galilean transition from Canaanite to Israelite culture, even though the date of the de? struction has not yet been ascertained (Ben-Tor 1997: 124).19 Both the biblical narrative (Josh 11:20) and Yadin (1975: 207 and n. 3; 1979: 66) link Hazor's destruction to Israelite tribes. Ben- Tor cautions against over-certainty while allow- ing for the possibility of an Israelite destruction (1997: 123-24; 1998; 2002: 307-8). Others sug? gest Ramesses II (Schafer-Lichtenberger 2001) or a later Egyptian army (Kochavi cited in Singer 1994: 309, n. 161), the Sea Peoples (Fritz cited in Yadin 1979:66) or competing Canaanite city-states (Frankel 1994: 32). At Hazor, a century separated destruction and settlement. The Iron I village was small and im- poverished.20 Its inhabitants slept in tents or huts, built fires in hearths and stored their foodstuffs in jars and silos. The simple ceramic repertoire in? cluded Galilean and Tyrian pithoi (fig. 3).21 Noth? ing found at Hazor proves the identity of its Iron I inhabitants. Ben-Ami's claim of cultural disconti- nuity notwithstanding (2001), some Iron I residents reused a bronze figurine ofa Canaanite god (Yadin 1972: 132-34; Nakhai 2001: 171-72). In the mid-tenth century, Hazor became stra- tegically important to the new nation of Israel, which embarked on major building projects there (IKgs9:15; Yadin 1972:135).22Oneconsequence of this Stratum X construction was that workers clearing rubble and digging foundations became newly aware ofthe centuries-old Stratum 1 A=XIII destruction. It may have been at this point that the thirteenth century decimation of the site came to be attributed to the putative ancestors of Hazor's tenth century settlers, thereby providing justifica- tion for the Israelite presence at Hazor.23 It is also possible that Judg 4, the prose retelling ofthe old Judg 5 victory poem, which creates a fictitious link between Jabin of Hazor and the battle led by Deborah,24 was part of this aetiological process. Dan. Tel Dan had been home to a thriving Canaanite city called Laish, attested in the Execra- tion Texts, the Mari Letters and through recent ex? cavations at the site. The limited destruction of the final Late Bronze Age settlement (Stratum VIIB; Biran 1987: 106; 1994a: 125-26; 1994b: 4-5) resulted in a century-long abandonment (Na'aman 1994: 272). The subsequent Stratum VI settlement is attributed to the tribe of Dan (Josh 19:40-48; Judg 1:34; 18; Biran 1989, 1994a, 1994b and references therein). Some new residents lived in simple buildings but others stayed in tents or temporary huts. Kraters and cooking pots large</page><page sequence="144">ISRAEL ON THE HORIZON: THE IRON I SETTLEMENT OF THE GALILEE 137 10 cm SpTTIZ Southern Galilean SAN Tyrian Fig. 3 Pithoi ofthe Galilee. enough for group meals were found alongside smaller and more typical bowls, jugs and flasks. Grain was stored in deep silos that pitted the site, and in huge Galilean and collared-rim jars (fig. 3).25 The fact that some of the collared-rim jars were made in the south lends support to the bibli? cal notion of some people moving to Dan from the south (Judg 18; Biran 1989, 1994a: 126-35; 1994b: 4-5; Yellin and Gunneweg 1989),26 even as the story line reflects Judaean discomfort with the Iron II sanctuary at Dan. Later in the Iron I, the residents of Dan con? structed a more substantial settlement of small stone houses (Stratum VA-B). The presence of Cypro-Phoenician and some Philistine pottery points to increasingly cosmopolitan horizons and to a better standard of living. The Iron I village was completely destroyed by fire in the mid-elev- enth century (Biran 1994a: 135-43; 1994b: 6), but was soon rebuilt along the same lines. The settle? ment of Stratum IVB lasted into the tenth century, during which time it was incorporated into the kingdom of Israel. Additional Sites. cAbel-Beth-Ma3acah is a 35-acre mound in the Upper Galilee. It sits at a strategic crossroad overlooking the Huleh Basin and con- trols access into the Baqcah Valley to its north. The site has not yet been excavated but a survey indicates that it was settled in both the LB II and the Iron I (Dever 1986). Stratum III, the earliest stratum at Har Adir, is dated to the eleventh cen? tury. Remains include casemate walls, large pithoi and an iron pick. A bronze foundry was discov? ered at Tel Harasim, in its Iron I phase (Stratum III). Three Iron I strata were uncovered at Kibbutz Sasa. Three rooms may have been part ofa single eleventh century building. Plastered walls were decorated with red dots. Ceramic finds include pithoi and a kernos (Gal 1993:451-53). At Horvat cAvot, substantial building remains, arranged so as to ring the site, are attributed to several super- imposed strata. Tyrian and Galilean pithoi were both discovered there (Braun 1993). Conclusion: The Upper Galilee A complete description of the Iron I in the Upper Galilee remains difficult, since most sites are unexcavated or incompletely published.27 Overall, villages were self-sufficient. Regional exchange was limited; needs were met locally since villages were rather isolated. Continuity of settle? ment might be suggested by the fact that two-thirds of the villages inhabited in the Late Bronze Age were reoccupied in the Iron I, but this idea is con- tradicted by the lengthy gap separating LB II and</page><page sequence="145">13 8 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI Iron I settlements at those sites that have been ex? cavated. The burgeoning number of villages may be explained in part by the incursion of newcom- ers (Sea Peoples, southerners and northerners), but also by the movement of people from those major centers that had been destroyed or abandoned at the end of the LB II. A review of the most fully excavated and most important sites of the Upper Galilee shows that, biblical claims notwithstand- ing, defmitive evidence for an Israelite presence in the Iron I has not been recovered. Archaeological Evidence for the Iron I Settlement ofthe Galilee: The Lower Galilee Throughout the Lower Galilee, Late Bronze Age sites were concentrated in its southernmost part. Hinnatuni (Tel Hannaton) was the largest of these sites. While it never attained the importance of Hazor, Tyre and Akko (Frankel 1992: 883), it was mentioned in the Amarna Letters (EA 8,245; see Gal 1992: 56-62). Given its size, it must have dominated the local landscape, but its Bronze and Iron Age strata have not been excavated. Tel Gath- Hepher was the other large Late Bronze Age site in the Lower Galilee. Smaller sites include Tel Rekhesh,28 Tel Yincam, Beth Gan, Tell cEin Zippori, Tell el-Wawiyat, the fortress at Tel Qarnei Hittin29 and several more (Gal 1981, 1987, 1994: 36-38; Nakhai, Dessel and Wisthoff 1993; Liebowitz 1997a, 1997b; Dessel 1999). Many but not all the Late Bronze Age sites were destroyed and/or abandoned in the thirteenth-twelfth centu? ries. In the Iron I, approximately two dozen settle? ments were concentrated in the Beth Netofah Val? ley, along the Nahal Zippori, in the Nazareth Hills and in the Yavne5el Valley (Joffe 1987; Gal 1992). While some were located at previously occupied sites, others were first founded in the twelfth cen? tury, near springs or along the Nahal Zippori. In order to settle down, villagers first cleared trees, then farmed and raised livestock.30 Tell el-Wawiyat. Tell el-Wawiyat is a small mound located in the southwestem part of the Beth Netofah Valley. The range of LB II artifacts, in? cluding an unusually rich corpus of Cypriote and Mycenaean wares, suggests Wawiyat's role in in- ternational trade, mediated, presumably, by Hinnatuni at the western edge of the valley. The twelfth century destruction or dislocation that af? fected many contemporary sites did not disrupt life at Wawiyat. One ofthe two large Iron IA (Stratum III) buildings on the small mound originated in the LB II. Its main room contained a jar stand, a stone column base and an oven while smaller chambers contained bins set into their floors. Ar? tifactual remains suggest domestic activities and small-scale production. The other building, newly constructed in the Iron IA, was used for domestic activities (Nakhai, Dessel, and Wisthoff 1993; Nakhai 1997). The residents of Iron IA Wawiyat maintained stability and a comfortable standard of living through agriculture and trade. The unusually large ground stone assemblage suggests the market-ori- ented processing of agricultural products. Numer? ous awls, needles, loom weights and whorls indi? cate the manufacture of yarn or cloth. Stone molds point to small-scale metal production. Sheep, goat and cattle were raised locally, but some fish were a Nile River species and some mollusks originated in the Mediterranean. Wawiyat's abandonment at the end ofthe Iron IA may have been precipitated by economic inse- curity due to the loss of regional markets. The people who settled on the abandoned site in the Iron IB (Stratum II) built flimsy structures within the extant Stratum III buildings. A fieldstone wall, presumably to pen livestock, now surrounded the site. Once abandoned late in the Iron I, Wawiyat was never resettled (Nakhai, Dessel and Wisthoff 1993; Nakhai 1997). Tell cEin Zippori Tell cEin Zippori is located along the Nahal Zippori, some 8 km southwest of Tell el-Wawiyat. Like Wawiyat, cEin Zippori was con- tinuously occupied from the LB II (Stratum V) into the Iron I (Stratum IV). A large building complex ofthe LB II, which contained local and imported wares, was modified in the Iron I and used through? out the twelfth century. The site was resettled in the late eleventh or early tenth century (Stratum III). According to the excavator, its mid-tenth cen? tury destruction may be related to the growth of</page><page sequence="146">ISRAEL ON THE HORIZON: THE IRON I SETTLEMENT OF THE GALILEE 139 the Israelite monarchy, which endeavored to sub- due cEin Zippori's entrenched and well-function- ing elite with its roots in the Canaanite Late Bronze Age (Dessel 1997, 1999). Tel Yin cam and Beth Gan. Beth Gan and Tel Yincam are located in the Yavne'el Valley, at the southeastern edge ofthe Lower Galilee. Yincam contained several late-fourteenth century buildings that were destroyed at the end ofthe LB II. New construction soon took place and one older build? ing was transformed into an iron-working instal? lation. The well-constructed Iron I buildings were used into the tenth century, at which time new building took place (Liebowitz 1993,1997b). Little is known of LB II Beth Gan other than that it con? tained imported pottery. In the Iron I, two super? imposed phases ofa domestic structure indicate a lengthy period of occupation. Iron IIA pottery was discovered as well (Liebowitz 1997a). Conclusion: The Lower Galilee The Galilean pithos was not used south ofthe Jezreel and (other than at Tel Dan) the collared- rim pithos was not used north ofthe Beth Netofah. However, both collared-rim and Galilean pithoi were found in the southern Lower Galilee, which seems to have functioned as a transitional zone between Galilean sites to the north and Highland sites to the south. The fact that these two forms are found together in the southern Galilee high- lights the region's cultural diversity (Frankel 1992: 890; Gal 1994: 41; Jorgensen 1999: 35). The success of the southern villages may be attributed to several factors. Some villages had been occupied for many generations and their in? habitants, skilled at raising the best crops and live? stock, were able to generate marketable surpluses. The villages' strategic setting facilitated good trade relations with sites on the Plain of Akko and in the Jezreel and Beth Shan Valleys. The continuing Egyptian occupation of the valleys and the thriv- ing settlements along the coast must have had a positive impact on the local economy, by creating a strong market for surplus goods. This allowed some Lower Galilean sites to thrive well into?or even throughout?the Iron I. Summary: The Iron I Settlement ofthe Galilee Limited archaeological exploration makes any reconstruction of the Iron I in the Galilee tenta- tive. In the Upper Galilee, uncertainty about the date ofthe Hazor Stratum la=XIII destruction and about the causal agent(s) of its, and Dan's, destruc- tions further complicates the matter. Even so, their destruction and abandonment signifies the turn- ing point between the LB II and the Iron I. Once destroyed, both sites were abandoned for approxi? mately a century. Whether the other major sites of the Upper Galilee, Tel Ros and cAbel-Beth- Ma'acah, experienced a similar sequence of events is unknown. The six dozen or so Iron I villages in the Up? per Galilee were founded a century and more af? ter the destructive events that ended the Late Bronze Age at Dan and Hazor. This lengthy gap highlights the major rupture between the LB II and the Iron I, as does the shift to small settlements in the high mountains of the Galilee. These factors throw the relationship between the LB and Iron I populations ofthe Upper Galilee into question.31 On the other hand, the success of the Iron I vil? lages might be attributed to their residents' famil- iarity with the ecological niches in which they settled (Meyers 1983). Utilization of some tradi? tional ceramic forms and geopolitical networks likewise supports the notion of at least limited social continuity (Frankel 1992,1994; cf. Ben-Ami 2001: 160). In the Lower Galilee, approximately two dozen small villages were founded some time af? ter the destruction of the Canaanite cities of the Late Bronze Age. Concentrated in the southern? most sector, close to territory still under Egyptian control, some stood on previously occupied sites while others were founded de novo. Despite their seeming isolation, they were able to transcend the turmoil of the era, remaining stable and prosper- ous well into the Iron I. In many instances, their twelfth century inhabitants were descendants of old-timers, forced by shifting markets to modify their subsistence strategies but successful at ne- gotiating change and maintaining stability. This can be seen in the scale of architecture at each site and in the evidence for production and trade. At</page><page sequence="147">140 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI these sites, greater wealth and resilience and more wide-ranging contacts are apparent. Market forces and a degree of protection attained by proximity to Egyptian-controlled territory contributed to their long-term wellbeing. Change came to these sites, but only after the LB II-Iron IA occupational con? tinuum. The stability of these villages stands in contrast to the ongoing flux in villages elsewhere in the Galilee (Dessel 1999) and in the Highlands to the south. IDENTIFYING ISRAELITES IN THE IRON I Israelite Ethnicity According to the Bible, much of the Galilee, like the Central Highlands, was in Israelite hands from Israel's earliest days. Still, given its mix of populations and the lack of unity among its resi- dent communities,32 it is uncertain whether the Galilee ofthe Iron I could be called Israelite. Two matters are significant. One is the problem of text writing. When were the Conquest and Settlement stories written, and to what degree might they re? flect Iron I realities? As noted earlier, this topic is vigorously debated. Most scholars agree that Judg 5, the poem commemorating the battle between Deborah and Barak, is one ofthe oldest passages in the Bible (Cross 1973: 100-101; Freedman 1979,1987). It was originally composed in the late twelfth century and placed in its final form in the tenth century (Smith 2002: 8, 92 n. 99).33 As for the narratives in Joshua and Judges, the evidence suggests that they were written in the Iron II, even if some contain vague remembrances of earlier times (see Na'aman 1994 and references therein; see also Smith 2002). The second is ethnicity. Can any ofthe groups living in the Galilee be described as Israelite? Answering this question requires defining "Isra? elite," in order to identify Israelites alongside the Canaanites, Phoenicians and others for whom the Iron I Galilee was also home.34 Generally speak- ing, ethnic affiliation reveals itself through a shared or assumed cultural heritage and belief system, and through shared markers of daily life activities (Bloch-Smith and Nakhai 1999: n. 4). How might these components of ethnicity manifest themselves in material culture remains?35 Shared cultural heritage presumes a sense of common ancestry and a commitment to a common religious heritage. The veneration of traditional beliefs or forms of expression may be presented both textually and materially, encompassing con- ventions about places of worship, ritual objects used in worship ceremonies, mortuary customs and the language of worship.36 The material culture of daily life is seen in technological skills, in con? struction techniques and building styles, in agri? culture, in pottery-making,37 in food processing and meal preparation,38 in textile production and so forth. These should reflect commonality, but at the same time specialized adaptations to differing external circumstances and to changing temporal concerns must be expected. How can this information help identity Isra? elites in the two centuries ofthe Iron I, years that most scholars agree were critical for the develop? ment of Israelite ethnicity?39 Canaanite culture of the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, (1850-1200 b.ce.) had been hierarchical and urban-centered, and in the Iron II (1000-587 b.ce.) monarchies dominated in both Israel and Judah. The Iron I (1200-1000 b.ce.) differed sharply, since it was an era of local self-determination, lacking mecha- nisms for external social control. While it seems clear that events in the Iron I were critical to the formation of Israelite self-identity, it is not as easy to identify an Israelite in the Iron I as it is during the Monarchy, when national boundaries were es? tablished (see most recently Herr 1997; Joffe 2002). What might have motivated the bonding of disparate peoples in the Iron I? The need to sur? vive was shared by all, but more than shared sub? sistence strategies, ethnicity requires a shared ide? ology. According to Halpern, Israel's ethnicity was constructed around allegiance to Yahweh, shared terrain, common means of production, and con- sanguinity (1983: 224). Hesse and Wapnish em- phasize an interest in power and resources (1997). The search for Israel's ideological markers begins in the Late Bronze Age, a period that saw Canaan dominated by Egypt and forced to pro? vide it with agricultural products, livestock, raw materials, manufactured goods and even forced</page><page sequence="148">ISRAEL ON THE HORIZON: THE IRON I SETTLEMENT OF THE GALILEE 141 laborers. Between the late-thirteenth and late- twelfth centuries, Egyptian hegemony ended as drought and famine devastated parts of western Asia, as Aegean and Anatolian peoples moved south and as international trade dwindled. One consequence of this imperial disintegration was the immigration of Canaanites, shasu and others into the Central Highlands and the Judaean Hills. There, they founded small isolated villages, struc? tured around traditional kin-based groups. Those for whom a sedentary way of life was new may have adapted elements from the material culture traits of their more experienced neighbors. Given the congruence between these mountain villages and the Book of Judges, which places early Israel? ites clans in this region, the villages are seen as helpful for reconstructing critical elements of early Israelite identity (Stager 1985b; Finkelstein 1988). Other factors are also important. In what context did Yahwism, an element of faith unique to early Israel, develop?40 Early po- etry places Yahweh in the south, in Seir, Edom, Sinai, Paran and Teiman (Deut 33:2; Judg 5:4-5; Hab 3:3; Ps 68:7-8).41 Yahweh was specially ven- erated for leading Israel to freedom, victorious against the seemingly invincible might of Egypt (cf. Exodus 15; for discussion, see Cross 1973: 100-103; Freedman: 1979,1987; B. Mazar 1981b; Halpern 1983:224; Weinfeld 1993:118-19; Smith 2002: 81-82). In this context, the shasu of southern Trans? jordan and especially of Seir/Edom, are signifi? cant. Amenhotep III's early fourteenth century Topographical List, from Soleb in Nubia, notes Yhw in the Land ofthe shasu, providing the earli? est evidence for the god Yahweh and linking him with these nomadic people. According to Redford, "[T]he only reasonable conclusion is that one major component in the later amalgam that con- stituted Israel, and the one with whom the wor- ship of Yahweh originated, must be looked for among the Shasu of Edom already at the end of the fifteenth century b.c.e." (1992:273). Their later movements, particularly during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II, again brought them into conflict with Egypt. In this context, these Yahweh worship- pers may be identified with the Israel ofthe slightly later Merenptah Stele, which came to settle in the Central Highlands (Redford 1992: 269-75, 279; see also Rainey 2001). It cannot be coincidental that this region would become the heartland of the Israelite Monarchy. The Yahweh worshippers did not live there alone, but rather they settled among Canaanites and oth? ers who had also sought refuge in those remote mountains (see Mendenhall 1962). Extended con? tact between them and their neighbors would have been critical for the development of a common ethnicity and especially of a common religion. Over time, they would have shared their devotion to Yahweh, the god they revered above all else for his overwhelming defeat of Egypt. That this de- feat was the cornerstone of Yahwistic faith made their religion irresistibly appealing to others in the Highlands, who had suffered from Egyptian ex? ploitation throughout the Late Bronze Age. In this way, a full ethnicity would have been forged, one that had ideology at its core and that over time saw the development of a full range of shared lifestyle and technology traits, as well. Identifying Israelites in the Galilee The sparsely settled Galilee had been con? trolled by a handful of city-states during the Late Bronze Age, although rugged terrain circumscribed the degree to which these entities fully managed the region. In consequence of the staggered col? lapse of the Late Bronze Age urban system throughout the thirteenth and into the twelfth cen? tury, people were left homeless and on the move. Repercussions were felt throughout the Galilee, as cities and villages were destroyed or abandoned. Israel's responsibility for the destruction of the cities of the Galilee is a cornerstone of the bibli? cal narrative but, contrary to the textual explica- tion, this intensive military confrontation between Israel and Canaan never took place. After some time, people began once again to settle down. It was a century and more before Hazor, Dan and some Late Bronze Age villages were reoccupied and new villages were built. This activity may be seen as part ofthe same continuum of events that resulted in the founding of hundreds of new villages in the Central Highlands and the Judaean Hills. Whether or not the villages ofthe</page><page sequence="149">142 BETH ALPERT NAKHAI Iron I Galilee reflected older geopolitical divisions is a moot point, for the big cities no longer ex- erted regional control. The descendants of those people who left them may have cherished their cultural and religious heritages and they may have benefited from familiarity with the ecological niches into which they were now settling. Still, the enormity of the collapse of the Late Bronze Age, the hundred-year gap that separated LB II destruction and abandonment from Iron I settle? ment and the fundamental differences between the Late Bronze Age and Iron I ways of life cannot be underestimated. For those people whose ancestors had been at home in the urban-centered world of the Late Bronze Age, the collapse of that system and the eventual founding ofthe autonomous vil? lages of the Iron I represented a disjunctive and profound change. The one region that differed was the southernmost part ofthe Lower Galilee, where several small sites prospered well into the Iron I. Their stability hints at the strength ofthe rural elite and may be related to their proximity to the Egyp- tian-dominated Jezreel and Beth Shan Valleys, which saw no disruption during the first century ofthe Iron I. What can we conclude about the ethnic affili- ation of the people living in the Iron I Galilee? For one thing, their geographic isolation, attenu- ated by the barrier created by the Egyptian-con- trolled Jezreel and Beth Shan Valleys and the long- lived villages ofthe southernmost Lower Galilee, kept them buffered from events in the mountains to their south. For another, identification as an Is? raelite required more than proximity and shared subsistence strategies. It required adopting a reli? gious identity based upon the worship (although not the exclusive worship) of Yahweh, the god capable of defeating the widely detested Egyptians. The villages of the Central Highlands presented the ideal setting for developing this sense of shared ethnicity. Early textual links between Yahweh and southern deserts and between Yahweh and Ephraim, suggest that the core of Yahwistic wor- shippers settled in the Central Highlands rather than farther north. The fact that the Iron II nation of Israel would develop in the Highlands further supports this notion. Seen from this perspective, the settlers ofthe Iron I villages ofthe Galilee can? not be considered Israelite. Certainly, many had experienced tumultuous change throughout the transition between the LB II and the Iron I. Still, their experience was not the same as that of people in the Highlands. The differences between north and south would become fully visible through the lens ofthe United Monarchy and would be mag- nified further at the time of its late-tenth century dissolution, when the north broke free from south? ern rule and reinvigorated its older cultural tradi? tions. In short, to be an Israelite one needed to live among Israelites, sharing in the full range of their beliefs and behaviors. For those living in the Ga? lilee, this would not have been possible until the region came under the control of Israelite kings early in the Iron II.42 The biblical vision ofthe conquest of Canaan by a unified "Israel" is unsubstantiated but it seems that biblical authors employed the theme of con- flict in order to legitimate monarchic-era territo? rial acquisition.43 In doing so, they co-opted past destructions and attributed them to a putative body of Israelite forebears in order to forge a common national history. In this way they proved the more modern adage that the pen is mightier than the sword,44 for through their visionary writing they achieved a victory for Israel that was far greater than any ever attained by bloody battle.

The remaining storejars were manufac? tured in seven different southern locations, in the mid- twelfth to mid-eleventh centuries (Yellin and Gunneweg 1989). 19. Yadin first suggested 1200 b.ce. (1972: 108-9) and later, the second-third ofthe thirteenth century (1993: 603). Others opt for an earlier thirteenth century date (Beck and Kochavi 1985; Gal 1988-89: 83; Frankel 1992). 20.Following Yadin, most archaeologists describe two consecutive Iron I settlements at Hazor. Stratum XII was typified by the foundations for simple huts, and by numerous silos pitting the area of inhabitation. Stratum XI contained better built structures, includ? ing a small bench-lined sanctuary (Yadin 1972,1979; Ben-Tor, ed. 1989; inter alia). A new analysis ofthe Hazor material demonstrates that the remains from Stratum XII and Stratum XI belong to a single short- lived occupational phase. It was typified by flimsy buildings, tent dwellings and refuse pits filled with broken pottery and grinding stones. The pottery, dat? ing to the eleventh century, differs from the Canaanite pottery ofthe Late Bronze Age and marks the begin? ning ofthe new Iron Age repertoire (Ben-Ami 2001). 21. After Frankel (1994: fig. 3). 22. While some place that construction in the ninth cen? tury, new C14 readings from Tel Rehov authenticate the tenth century date (Bruins, van der Plicht and Mazar 2003). 23. According to Ben-Ami, the Israelite settlers of Iron I (Strata XII/XI) noted the destroyed remains ofthe Canaanite acropolis and created an aetiological nar? rative crediting their forebears with its destruction (2001: 169). However, the link between the popula? tions of Strata XII/XI and Stratum X is not clear. 24.

Younker This paper places the rise ofthe Iron Age polity of Ammon within its archaeological and historical context. It begins with a review ofthe settlement archaeology of ancient Ammon, beginning with the Late Bronze Age, a period when &lt;(nomadization " prevailed, and ending with the Iron II, which represents the apex of sedentarization in Ammon for this early period. The paper then explores the nature of Ammon s social organization and development through the late Late Bronze and early Iron Ages as inferred from both the settlement pattern and ethnographic parallels. Finally, the paper superimposes what is presently know from the avail? able contemporary historical sources on top ofthe picture that is provided by the archaeologi? cal record and the social organizational reconstruction to see how well the three layers mesh. Questions surrounding the "when" and "how" of the emergence of Israel have generated considerable attention within the scholarly community during the last few de- cades?an interest that, if anything, has increased in intensity the last few years, if the plethora of books and articles on the subject is any indica- tion. While the discussion has generally revolved around three basic models to explain this phenom- ena, the military conquest model, the peacefiil in- filtration model, and the indigenous sociological models (which appears in a variety of forms), re? cently the so-called "minimalist" school has ques- tioned whether ethnicity can even be identified in the archaeological record, and have argued that there is no evidence for any "early" Israel. Without doubt, one of the leading voices in rebutting the skeptical views ofthe "minimalists" on early Israel has been William G Dever (1992, 1995, 2001: 97-157). It is a question that is diffi? cult to deal with in a dispassionate manner for many people because the issues are fraught with significant political and theological implications. This essay will step back from the question of Israel's origins and offer a view ofthe origin of the Iron Age peoples as seen from the "other side of the Jordan," specifically the Ammonites. Un- like the case of the Israelites, we do not have an "Ammonite Bible" or any equivalent corpus of indigenous literature that provides an account of Ammonite origins and history. Although the He? brew Bible provides a brief account and some ref? erences on these matters, scholars specializing in the history and archaeology of Jordan are much more dependant upon the archaeological record, extra-biblical sources and anthropological mod- 153</page><page sequence="160">154 RANDALL W. YOUNKER els (including, e.g., insights from ethnography and ethnoarchaeology) for the reconstruction of Jordan's early history. This is at once a disadvan- tage and an advantage. While we don't enjoy the insights possible in a rich literary tradition such as scholars of ancient Israel's past enjoy with the Hebrew Bible, we are at the same time less fet- tered by the emotional reactions to various inter? pretations ofthe text and the controversy of com- peting historical reconstructions of that literary tradition that often impede the study of Israel's origins. While we should not, and won't, ignore the few references to the Ammonites that appear in the biblical text, their relative paucity provides us with an opportunity to reflect more on what the picture of the emergence of Iron Age peoples of Cis- and Transjordan would look like if we con- centrate our focus more on the archaeological, an? thropological and extra-biblical sources for our re? construction. SETTLEMENT ARCHAEOLOGY OF EARLY AMMON1 LB IB-IIA Settlement Pattern? Nomadization (1450-1300 b.c.e.) Similar to the pattern in Cisjordan, the cur? rent available archaeological data suggests that there was a significant decrease in sedentary oc? cupation at the end ofthe Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze IA in ancient Ammon. This drop in sedentary occupation seems to continue into the LB IB. To date, archaeologists have not been able to isolate any sites dating specifically to the LB IB or the LB IIA in Ammon. In some cases, this apparent settlement gap may be because the ce? ramic forms that have been recovered happen to be those that run throughout the entire Late Bronze period (see McGovern 1986). In other cases, the necessary analysis or publication has not yet been completed. Whatever the case, the quantity of LB IB-IIA material, which has been recovered from Ammon, is not very great. Indeed, there have not yet been any settlement sites (villages, towns or cities) that can actually be dated to either LB IB or IIA in Ammon with any confidence (Table 1), suggesting not only a decline ofthe already sparse sedentary occupation from LB IA, but a virtual reversion to the non-sedentary end of the settle? ment continuum not seen in Ammon since the EB IV While there does not seem to be any evidence for settlements in Ammon during the LB IB-IIA, there is evidence that people were living in the area. This evidence comes in the form ofa unique rectangular, almost square, structure found at Umm ad-Dananir(McGovern 1989:128-36, below), and three burial caves that were found in the nearby Baqcah Valley: Jebel al-Hawayah Tomb A2, and Jebel al-Qesir Tombs B3 and B30 (McGovern 1986: 14-15). For LB IIA proper, the data paint essentially the same picture (Table 1). There may be an LB IIA settlement at Sahab, southeast of Amman (Ibrahim 1992: 899), although no ceramics have been published to enable any chronological preci- sion concerning the duration ofthe settlement dur? ing the Late Bronze Age. Late Bronze Age II pot? tery dating broadly from the beginning ofthe four- teenth to the end of the thirteenth centuries (cor- responding to the LB IIA and LB IIB, that is, ca. 1400-1200 b.c.e.) has also been reported at Tell Safut, although no architectural remains have yet been isolated (Wimmer 1992: 896-97). Beyond these sites, evidence of LB IIA activity in Ammon is restricted to the "isolated sanctuaries" at Umm ad-Dananir northwest of Amman (McGovern 1989: 128-36), which continued in use from the previous period, the Amman Airport Structure, east of Amman, which was added during this period, and the LB IIA burials at Sahab Tomb C (Dajani 1970). The burial caves in the Baqcah Valley north? west of Amman (Jebel al-Hawayah A2, and Jebel al-Qesir B3 and B30) also continued to be used during the LB IIA (McGovern 1986: 14-15). Early Sedentarization in LB IIB/Iron IA Ammon (ca. 1250-1150 b.c.e.)2 After the LB IB-IIA periods, in which there was virtually no sedentary occupation in Ammon, the latter part ofthe LB IIB witnessed a dramatic resurgence of highland settlements in both Cis- and Transjordan, including Ammon (see</page><page sequence="161">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 155 Table 1.

A review ofthe sur? vey and excavation reports indicates that at least twenty sites in Ammon have been assigned to the LB IIB/Iron IA transition of which at least fifteen can be classified as either a farmstead or village (see Table 1 and fig. 1; Younker 1997).3 In addi? tion to these sites, a number of cemeteries and tombs have been excavated with finds which date to the Late Bronze Age, including the Jebel al- Hawayah Burial Caves Al and A2, the Jebel al- Qesir Burial Caves B3, B5, B6, B9, B30 and Sahab Tomb C (McGovern 1986). Site-Size Distribution. The "settlement" sites range in size from "medium-sized sites" to very small (for standard site-size classification for Pal? estine see Gonen 1984). The size ofthe settlement sites have been estimated as follows: the Amman Citadel: 100-125 dunams; cUmayri: 65 dunams; Sahab: 50 dunams; Umm ad-Dananir: 25 dunams; Jawa: 21 dunams; Safut: 17.3 dunams; Rehil: 5.6 dunams; Khirbet Othman: uncertain. The other sites are all less than five dunams; in most cases, less than a dunam. Site-size data show that the largest group of sites (11) fall in the very small or tiny range (1-10 dunams); six sites are classified as small (11-50 dunams); two sites are medium-sized (51-100 dunams); and one site is large (101-199 dunams). It must be emphasized, however, that in the case ofthe settlements, the size estimates are based on the approximate present size ofthe tell, or the cur? rent extent ofthe ruins, rather than actual excava? tion of the LB II/Iron I strata. Chances are that most of these size estimates should be revised slightly downward. Site Function. Of these twenty sites, eight are probably actual settlements (cities, towns, vil? lages): the Amman Citadel, cUmayri, Sahab, Umm ad-Dananir, Jawa, Safut, Khirbet Othman and Rehil. Three sites consist of what has been de? scribed as the quadratbau or a "middle courtyard" structure: Rujm el-Henu, the Amman Airport</page><page sequence="162">156 RANDALL W. YOUNKER Fig. 1 Late Bronze Age IIB/Iron IA Transition Settlement Pattern in Ammon. Structure and El-Mabrak (Yassine 1983).4 Three more sites have been described vaguely as "hill? top forts"?Jebel et-Teweim, Khirbet el-5Edhmah and Rujm MadbVa (Gordon and Knauf 1987). The remaining seven sites are small, non-descript sherd scatters or building sites, that latter of which may have served as farmsteads, although a full study of the features associated with the buildings has not been published (for a list of these sites and references, see Younker 1999, table 9.2). Sedentarization in Iron Age Ammon? Settlement Pattern, Size and Function in Iron IA-B (ca. 1200-1000 b.c.e.) The Iron IA-B period in Ammon witnessed substantial growth in terms ofthe sedentary popu? lation. The number of sites in Ammon jumped from twenty in the LB IIB-Iron IA transition period to sixty-nine in the Iron IA-B proper (see Table 1 and fig. 2; Younker 1997a: 141).5 A review ofthe surveys and excavation reports for Ammon reveal that at least twenty-seven of these sites appear to be actual settlements (urban, town or villages) as compared with eight from the end of the Late Fig. 2 Iron Age IA-B Settlement Pattern in Ammon. Bronze Age II. Of these twenty-seven settlements, one (Amman) ranks as a large site (199-101 dunams), two are medium sites (100-51 dunams) and twenty-four are small sites (50-11 dunams). These data clearly point to the emergence ofa more complex settlement hierarchy. Of the three larger sites (Amman, Tell el- cUmayri and Sahab), the first two show evidence of city wall systems. These include the "cyclopean" wall found at the Amman Citadel (Dornemann 1983: 91; Burdajewicz 1993: 1247), and the "casemate" wall at Tell el-cUmayri (Younker et al. 1993). The latter included a dry moat and an earthen rampart supported by a re? vetment wall. It is certainly the most complex for? tification system in Ammon and perhaps all of ancient Palestine. Beyond their obvious defensive purpose, these wall systems can also be seen as an indication of a transformation of social relations in terms of control over labor resources and agri? cultural surpluses (see Joffe 1993: 50). At one time it was thought that a number of "megalithic" towers or forts had been built around the borders of Ammon during the Iron IA, espe? cially along the southern, western and northern</page><page sequence="163">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 157 frontiers, to defend Ammon from incursions from the Israelites and others (e.g., Glueck 1939,1970: 181-83; Landes 1956, 1961). A closer examina- tion of these structures including excavation of several of these sites has shown that his hypoth? esis was incorrect; most of these "towers" were built at different times throughout the Iron II (see Dornemann 1983; Yassine 1988 : 17; Younker et al. 1990; Kletter 1991; Najjar 1992). Many ofthe remaining forty-two sites, which generally consist of only a single building (often described as "fortresses" in the reports), appear to be fortified farming compounds. This should be compared to twelve such sites from the Late Bronze IIB/Iron IA transition. Other sites are prob? ably small settlements less than 24 dunams, but most surveyors have tended to provide only de- scriptive terms rather than precise measurements of these sites. Settlement Pattern, Size and Function in Iron IIA-B (ca. 1000-700 b.c.e.) Settlement in Ammon during the Iron IIA-B period continued to expand. At least ninety-seven sites can be classified as belonging to the Iron IIA- B period (ninth to sixth centuries b.ce.; Younker 1997: 163). A small amount ofthe increase can be attributed to expanded borders; Hesban for ex? ample, appears to have come under Ammonite control by Iron II (Vyhmeister 1989). There is, nevertheless, a significant increase in site density within the heartland of Ammon (Boling 1989; Younker 1989). Of the ninety-seven Iron IIA-B sites, thirty- six appear to be actual settlements, that is, small towns or villages consisting of several houses. This is a significant increase (33%) over the Iron I period's twenty-seven settlements. Most of the principal settlement sites from the preceding Late Bronze II and Iron I periods continue to be occu? pied during the Iron II, including the Amman Cita? del, Tell el-cUmayri West, Sahab, Jawa, Umm ad- Dananir and Safiit. However, the vast majority of Iron II sites represent new settlements. Two of the new Iron II settlements appear to be "medium-size" sites between 50 and 100 dunams. They include Khilda (an extensive settle- ment), and the Sports City Site (another extensive settlement). The other thirty sites appear to be "small sites" of 25 dunams or less.6 Again, the actual size of only a few of these settlements are provided by the surveyors; rather, only descrip? tive terms such as "rather large site" or "large ru- ined village" are provided. The remaining sixty-one Iron II sites are clas- sified as "very small" sites of less than 10 dunams. Again, the terminology used to describe these sites varies from one surveyor to the next. In general, most of these sites consist of one or two rectangu? lar buildings built of chert of limestone blocks. The structures are variously described as "block- houses," "forts," "qasrs," "tower forts," "towers," "rujms," "farmsteads" or "agricultural com- plexes." Based on an intensive survey ofa 5 km region around Tell el-cUmayri and the examina? tion of many of these sites outside the Madaba Plains Project study region, we may conclude that the vast majority of these sixty-one sites were prob? ably agricultural complexes (Younker 1989). A number of features ofthe sites lead to this conclu? sion. First of all, the overall appearance of most of these blockhouse sites resembles the agricul? tural qusur common in Jordan during the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. More impor? tant, they are generally located near numerous agricultural features, including prime agricultural fields, cisterns, perimeter walls, field walls, ter? races, bedrock for preparation areas, winepresses, millstones and storage caves (Younker 1989:196). Based on these criteria, at least sixty-one of the very small Iron II period sites can probably be clas- sified as fortified agricultural compounds or com? plexes. This shows an increase over the forty-two agricultural sites dated to the Iron I period and ten agricultural sites dated to the end of the Late Bronze period. This pattern points to a definite shift from a nomadic lifestyle during LB IA to a sedentary, intensive agriculture life style between the LB II and Iron II periods. It might also be suggested that by the Iron II period a distinctive three-tiered hierarchy appears in the settlement pattern (1 large, 7 medium and 25 small settlements) pointing towards a social hi? erarchy typical ofa more complex, integrated so? cial organization. Rabbath-Ammon would have,</page><page sequence="164">15 8 RAND ALL W. YOUNKER of course, been the regional center, the medium- sized sites probably served as local centers and the smaller settlements were the villages that sup? ported the local centers. Interestingly, biblical lit? erature has an expression for these smaller sup? porting settlements?"daughter settlements" (Frick 1985). The latter villages would have been supported by the numerous farmsteads in their immediate vicinity. Overall, then, the settlement pattern for the Iron IIA-B points to an increasing hierarchy, suggesting a growing social complex? ity. EVOLUTION OF ANCIENT AMMON'S SOCIAL ORGANIZATION Early Canaan's Interacting Social Components The settlement pattern that I have outlined above for Ammon, is actually just a part of the larger regional pattern in all Canaan and the tail end of a sequence of oscillations between nomadization and sedentarization that can be traced back to the Early Bronze Age. Thus, in or? der to understand the process by which Transjordan's Iron Age kingdoms emerged, it is first necessary to understand the nature of Canaan's social organization prior to that time. This has been most effectively set out by Joffe (1993). Through an analysis of archaeological data from excavated sites and settlement archaeology, Joffe has identi? fied three major social components or forms that emerged for the first time in Canaan during the EB II. Joffe describes these three social forms as urban, rural, and non-sedentary (1993: 64). Ac? cording to Joffe, it was primarily the interaction of these three forms that defined the social dy- namics of Canaan throughout its history. The roots of these three social components are to be found in the EB I. Rise of Canaan's "City-states" According to Joffe, early socio-political orga? nization in Canaan prior to the Early Bronze Age initially revolved around small kin- or lineage- based domestic units. However, during the later EB I, there emerged a system of ranking, exchange and resource control. Joffe follows in arguing that emergent stratification and labor control take place under conditions of environmental diversity, cir- cumscription, variable productive potential and ag? ricultural risk that promotes labor intensive and economic diversification strategies?conditions all of which were present in Canaan during the EB I (1993: 53). He argues that one ofthe major mecha- nisms that mobilized labor in EB I Canaan was the growing of grape crops for alcohol produc? tion. Those peoples that were the most produc? tive, best situated and best organized grew and eventually emerged as agrarian elites. Another important controlled commodity that was central to increased interaction and exchange was cop? per. Joffe suggests that prestige and power was accrued by those elites who had access to copper and could ensure its proper utilization, particularly in enhancing agricultural production (1993: 53- 54). While wine and copper production were pri? marily for indigenous use, Joffe argues that Egyp? tian interest in these Canaanite commodities dur? ing the EB I, "though highly localized and ex? tremely limited in actual quantities, was another important impetus spurring reorganization of pro? duction and exchange in the 'core' areas" (1993: 54). Canaan's "emerging agricultural elites ... competed for different shares ofthe Egyptian 'mar? ket' and for the economic and social returns of being 'linked to that market.'" While Joffe does not suggest that the Egyptian presence in Canaan initiated the agricultural intensification and in? creased economic activity, the "contact served to direct and intensify many ofthe changes already occurring in society..." (1993: 57). As various factors led to Egypt's eventual withdrawal from southern Canaan towards the end of EB I, the newly organized Canaanite poli- ties "took a transformational step to a new level," which included "the emergence of ag- glomerated, nucleated and differentiated settle? ment and organization" (Joffe 1993: 58, 64). This new level of social complexity in Canaan has been described variously as urban, indepen? dent walled towns, city-states or inchoate states (i.e., Amiran 1970; Schaub 1982).</page><page sequence="165">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 159 The use of these terms has evoked consider? able discussion and controversy in that when Canaan's urban forms, institutions and material culture are compared with similar categories from Egypt or Mesopotamia, Canaan always falls short. Joffe contends that making such cross-cultural conclusions may be comparing apples with or- anges. First, are the obvious but often over-looked scalar differences in geography and demography for example. For this reason alone, Joffe argues, it is important to evaluate the diversity of Canaan's continuum of settlement and social organization on its own terms. More than that, however, Joffe contends that while it may be appropriate to des- ignate Canaan's maximal and most complex so? cial form as urban in that it might provide some basis for cross-cultural comparison, Canaanite ur- banism must not be seen simply as a scaled-down version of Mesopotamian or Egyptian urbanism; rather, it is "something different and was arrived at independently" (1993: 65). In fact, as Joffe notes, one ofthe enigmas of EB I is Canaan's ap? parent failure to have learned anything from its contact with Egypt; there is virtually no evidence for cultural borrowing?Egyptian writing, art, technology or organizational patterns made little impact on Canaan. The reason for Canaan's non-responsiveness and difference, according to Joffe, is to be found in the fact that at its most basic level, Canaanite society was fundamentally different from that of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Whereas in Mesopotamia the base social unit was the city, and in Egypt, the nome, in Canaan the principal organizational ele? ment was the kinship group. The increase of so? cial complexity in Canaan was, thus, structured around and through the fundamental kinship unit, partially as an adaptive device to retain the capac- ity for rapid downward reorganization in the event of societal collapse?an ever-present possibility in a marginal environment. This self-limiting but risk-abating trajectory was, therefore, not respon- sive to Egyptian social evolutionary patterns, tra- jectories or culture; if it would have been, "the capacity for reversal would have been compro- mised"(1993:60). Urban Versus Kin-based Countryside This desire to retain the capacity for rapid downward reorganization or social decomposition not only resulted in Canaan's non-responsiveness to external organizational and cultural patterns (Egyptian or other), it also eventually contributed to the emergence of an anti-urban ideology within its own society (Joffe 1993: 64). This anti-urban ideology apparently developed during the EB II as growing urban centers attempted to extend so- cioeconomic and political control over the coun? tryside. According to Joffe, these anti-urban ide- ologies "were part of the rationalization for the retention of mechanisms related to social decom? position, which would become of great importance in the EB IV period and in later periods of col? lapse" (Joffe 1993: 64). Indeed, Canaan's deliber- ate retention ofthe capability for social decompo? sition set up a cyclic process of what Joffe calls "generation, resolution and regeneration of con- tradiction." Through the adoption of the longue duree view of Braudel (1980), Joffe claims that these cycles of "generation, resolution and regen? eration of contradiction"?oscillations of rising and collapsing complexity?can be traced in Canaan from the EB II down through the Iron Age. Hints that non-urban social forms persisted within different regions of Syro-Palestine between the Early Bronze and Iron Ages can be detected from a variety of sources. For example, second-millen- nium texts suggest that certain towns in Syria and the Levant, including Keilah in Judah, lacked any notion of "kingship" (Joffe 1993:90). Rather, their forms of civil government consisted of non-cen- tralized, communal or "traditional" patterns of or? ganization such as a council of elders (Reviv 1989). The Execration Texts from the Middle Bronze Age seem to illustrate a shift from these more commu? nal forms of organization to a more centralized authority (Posener 1971; Gerstenblith 1983: 18- 20). The Amarna Letters highlight a tension be? tween the literate urban society and those who chose to remove themselves from the centralized authority such as the Hab/piru and Shasu (below). Finally, Joffe correctly points out that numerous biblical texts point to a continuing anti-king, anti-</page><page sequence="166">160 RANDALL W. YOUNKER urban sentiment that continued in sectors of Israel down to the end ofthe Iron Age II (Joffe 1993: 90-92; Tadmor 1982; Frick 1985). Some have in- ferred from Genesis 36 that Edom possessed a similar communal social organization (Bartlett 1992: 288). Cycles ofResolution and the Rise of Ammon Joffe's reconstruction of these oscillations down into the LB II/Iron Age is of particular in? terest since they have possible implications for constructing the evolutionary trajectory towards complexity in Ammon. According to Joffe (1993: 90-91), the LB II again exhibited a cycle of "reso- lution." As scholars ofthe history of ancient Pal? estine are aware, the collapse of Late Bronze Age society is associated with the phenomenon ofthe Hab/piru?a people mentioned in both Egyptian and Mesopotamian texts who reside outside the control of the state?a phenomenon that Joffe views not as rural banditry, but rather as an "out- migration and social re-identification as institu- tionalized responses" to the threats posed by the urban centers and Egyptian authorities. As is also well known, the Amarna Letters clearly reflect the negative attitudes of urban society toward those who chose to remove themselves from the con- trols of centralized authority (cf. Astour 1964; Gonen 1984; Na'aman 1986; Finkelstein 1988: 339-48). Joffe reasonably maintains that it is not unlikely that the Hab/piru viewed the city with complementary hostility (1993: 91). It is impor? tant to remember that while many scholars see those who fled to the highlands (often identified with the Hab/piru) as refugees from the Canaanite city-states, Joffe's model views the tension as ex- isting between the less kin-based urban centers and the more kin-based countryside?both the seden? tary and non-sedentary rural components. Rise ofthe Kin-based Countryside Joffe's study makes an important contribution to understanding the components and processes of social evolution in the southern Levant. How? ever, it might be suggested that, while Joffe's model of cyclic urban rise and collapse appears to work well for the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Ages, it fails to acknowledge adequately some dis? tinctive new developments in the LB/Iron Age (see 1993: 86). While he perceptively realizes that "anti-urban and anti-royal biases ofthe kin-based countryside" find their ultimate expressions in the later (i.e., Late Bronze and Iron Age) periods, he doesn't quite reveal just how far this "ultimate expression" transcends in its magnitude, complex? ity and permanence anything that the previous two millennia had witnessed (see Portugali 1994:214; Finkelstein 1995: 349, 354, 361). I would argue that the resistance ofthe "anti- urban, kin-based countryside" in Canaan was so strong towards the end of the Late Bronze Age that it led to the formation of entirely new social structures. New, not in the sense that the kin-based foundation was abandoned, but rather in the sense that this foundation itself now grew to a new level of complexity. That is to say, the anti-urban, kin- based countryside evolved for the first time into several relatively large and powerful complex poli- ties that were not only capable of resisting the power of the long-lived local urban entities, the Canaanite city-states, but could actually compete with and, eventually, even displace them (see Mendenhall 1973: 186 for a similar view). Ulti- mately, these new polities would even attempt to resist dominance from outside aggressors (espe? cially external states such as Egypt, Syria and Assyria) although success in this latter venture remained ultimately elusive. In brief, then, what Joffe's otherwise fine model fails to note is that the most significant point about the Late Bronze urban collapse in Canaan is that for the first time since their appearance in the Early Bronze, the Canaanite city-states, such as they existed throughout the Early, Middle and Late Bronze Ages, do not rebound from the Late Bronze Age collapse. Instead, they are displaced by en? tirely new polities?polities that, while maintain- ing their kin-based foundation, will eventually form what many scholars have referred to as the nation-states (although as will be suggested be? low, might better be called tribal states) of Edom, Moab and Ammon and, in western Palestine, Is? rael (see Younker 1997a).</page><page sequence="167">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 161 The urban entities that reappear in Palestine during the Iron Age are ?o/re-emergent city-states. Rather, they are outgrowths of the new broader, kin-based entities that now dominate the land. While urban centers continued to play an impor? tant part of this new society, social organization now centered on tribal territories rather than city- states. Thus, Iron Age urbanism in Cis- and Transjordan differed from its Bronze Age prede- cessors in that it was now subsumed within the overarching kin-based social structure of those peoples who had previously occupied the hinter- land (Stager 1985). Generative Genealogy The mechanism for this upward spiral of in? creasing complexity might best be described along the lines already invoked by Joffe?Lancaster and Lancaster's "generative genealogy" (1988). As Joffe notes, during the Early Bronze Age social organizational fluidity enabled Syro-Palestinian society to move back and forth between different social organizational levels from "individual kin? ship" groups to "the macro levels of tribal confed- erations" (Joffe 1993: 82). Unfortunately, Joffe does not pursue this suggestive concept further. Yet the fluidity that Joffe discerns at the heart of these Canaanite kinship ties from the Early Bronze down through the Late Bronze Ages provides the key to understanding the nature of the organiza? tional dynamics that lead to the increasing com? plexity that culminated in the emergence of the Iron Age polities of Syro-Palestine, including Ammon. Social Fluidity and the Rise of Supra-Tribal Polities As noted above, Joffe suggests that the pro? cess of generative genealogy, wherein the inher- ent fluidity that characterizes kinship ties enabled the emergence of different levels of kinship orga- nizations from individual kinship groups to tribal confederacies, began in the Early Bronze Age. However, the levels of kinship-based social orga? nization that Joffe discerned for the Early Bronze never reached the levels of scale and complexity that were attained in the Iron Age. While Joffe rec- ognizes the role of tribalism during the Iron Age (1993: 82,91), his focus was on the Early Bronze; thus, he did not devote his attention to analyzing the extent and nature of tribalism in the latter pe? riod. For the same reason, Joffe did not attempt to explain the actual process by which higher kin? ship levels, such as tribal confederacies, are reached. One ofthe more recent attempts at explicitly outlining the processes by which supra-tribal poli? ties rise in a Middle East context is that of Tapper. As Tapper notes, attempts to explain variation in tribal forms, the emergence of tribal confedera? cies or central tribal leadership, generally presume the existence of an ideal-type tribal system whose features typically include a segmentary lineage system, a simple division of labor, egalitarian ide- als of organization and political autonomy, al? though there is no agreement on which of these features are essential (1990: 64). At any rate, deviations from the ideal tribal form are attributed to a series of differentiating variables that are usually categorized as either in? ternal (e.g., culture, demography, ecology and economy) or external (e.g., the roles ofthe state and/or neighboring tribes, the proximity of fron- tiers, cities and trade routes). Most important of the internal variables is the nature of access to land for farming, grazing or wealth accumulation. That is, access to land or the acquisition of wealth is the basis for the "formation and nature of commu? nities or corporations at determinate levels of tribal societies as well as rivalries and factions between them" (Tapper 1990: 64-65). In practice this is reflected in the formation of coalitions at determi? nate levels of tribal society that generally stand in opposition to rival coalitions and factions. Within a given region, these rival alliances tend to take on a chessboard pattern in which adjacent tribal neighbors are hostile with each other, but have al? liances with their rival's neighbors. Tapper observes that when a strong leader desires to control a whole region, he will usually form a coalition with one block to overcome an? other. The basis for the coalition or confederacy is generally more the hope of material gain, rather</page><page sequence="168">162 RAND ALL W. YOUNKER than on any notions of common descent, religious or other ideology of unity, although the latter are not necessarily lacking and may be retained as a facade. The sustaining of both the leadership and the coalition is usually dependant upon whether a surplus of goods is generated. Subsequently, as Tapper points out, the formation of supra-tribal communities and corporations on the basis of in? ternal variables actually tends to contradict seg- mentary ideology; indeed, they can actually inhibit unity in the face of an external threat. Tapper notes, however, that it is generally agreed that the main variables, which determine the emergence of central leadership in tribal soci? ety on a broader regional basis, are external?spe? cifically, the presence of other supra-tribal enti? ties or states (Tapper 1990: 66). When an external state attempts to exert control over tribal peoples the latter normally have a number of choices on how to respond. At the broadest level, they can, of course, either submit or resist. Voluntary submis- sion is usually conditional: the state continues to tolerate tribal patterns of organization and main- tains its control over the tribal society through tribal leaders or chiefs. If the state insists on unconditional submis- sion, perhaps even to the extent of total destruc? tion of tribal structures and integration of the people into the wider state-controlled society, tribes may choose to resist outright. That resis- tance can take different forms. One option is for tribes to organizefor a military confrontation by forming a confederacy. Another strategy is to avoid state control by maintaining a diffuse form of tribal organization?Gellner's "divide that ye be not ruled" or Yapp's "jellyfish tribes" (Gellner 1981; Yapp 1983). In the most extreme cases of avoid- ance, tribes may even abandon their tribal organi? zation or may choose to flee rather than fight. Such avoidance strategies are more feasible in frontier, desert and mountainous regions. Nomadization is a common manifestation of this latter avoidance strategy (see LaBianca 1990). As Tapper notes, historically, tribal groups in the Middle East have shown evidence of processes of both evolutionary and cyclical or alternating change: Political evolution in scale and complexity? from tribe to state or state-like confederacy, involving the unification of disparate groups, centralization of authority, and stratification? has occurred again and again, as have evolu? tion from kinship and descent to territorial al- legiance and control of means of production as principles of organization (Tapper 1990: 66). As Tapper points out, centralized tribal unions often approximate states, being territorially defined and stratified under a ruling dynasty and elite; by origin they are secondary states. In more recent times many Muslim dynasties have had such ori? gins (Tapper 1990: 68). The reverse process is also seen "whether it is called collapse, devolution, or retribalization from powerful confederacies into more diffiise organization and simpler groups ..." (Tapper 1990: 67). A key point Tapper makes is that none of these cases of evolution or devolu? tion can be interpreted as clear-cut evidence in support of any particular theory of tribe or state formation. A final and important point that Tapper makes in his essay is that most empirical tribes and states are actually a hybrid that can appear in one of three forms: (1) a chiefdom; (2) a confederacy; or (3) a tribal state (1990: 68). Tapper defines a chiefdom in this sense as "a territorially bounded collectiv- ity of groups (usually tribal groups) with coordi- nated and possibly dynastic leadership but with little elaboration of government of stratification of society." A confederacy is a union of tribal groups for political purposes, sometimes allied on the basis of imputed common descent (but not always). Such a tribal confederacy (which Tapper points out may be tribal only in the sense of being composed of tribes) may approximate a state, being territori? ally defined and stratified under a ruling dynasty and elite?by origin they are secondary states. The third hybrid?the tribal state?can actu? ally occur in three forms (Tapper 1990: 69). The first, and most common among premodern states, is where one tribal (descent-based) elite or dynasty rules a conquered territory and its heterogeneous population. The second form is where a nontribal dynasty attains power by, and continues to depend</page><page sequence="169">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 163 on, tribal support. The third form is where the rul? ers who come to power eventually attempt to eradi- cate existent tribalism by promoting a nationalist ideology of integration that resembles a tribal ide? ology. Ofthe three hybrids that Tapper describes, the one that best fits ancient Ammon (and the other Iron Age polities) seems to be the confederacy?a union of tribal groups based upon the idea of im- puted common descent?certainly the origin sto? ries contained in the Hebrew Bible for both Israel and Ammon point in this direction (see Gottwald 1979). Tribal Dynamics and Generative Genealogies When Tapper's description of historic tribal dynamics in the recent Middle East is compared with Joffe's model of urban/kinship dynamics for the early Levant, it is fairly obvious that they are essentially describing the same process. Tapper points out that numerous studies show that both tribe and state are conceptualized by tribes people as opposed cultural categories?this is essentially the same way Joffe describes the urban/kinship countryside opposition of the Early Bronze Age in this same region. Indeed, Joffe's work on the Early Bronze Age urban/kinship opposition has effectively provided the origin for the later, his? toric tribe/state opposition described by Tapper for this same general region. As I argue below, it was the Late Bronze/Iron Age transition, discussed in this study, that wit- nessed the beginning of the transition from the local, small-scale, urban/rural kinbased opposition to a larger, more complex tribe/tribe opposition and tribe/state opposition. The state entity that precipitated this new, broader, regional opposition was Egypt. The initial reaction of local tribal peoples such as those in Ammon, was an avoid- ance strategy wherein tribal peoples retreated to the marginal frontier zones in the highlands or deserts and, in many cases, underwent nomadization (Finkelstein 1995: 355). Eventually, as Egypt was forced to withdraw?probably due to a complex of issues that were tied into the gen? eral collapse that the entire Levant experienced towards the end ofthe Late Bronze Age (see Ward and Joukowsky 1992; and especially Weinstein 1992 and Dever 1992)?the tribes people opted for a different strategy of aggressive resistance by forming military confederacies. Certainly, the documentary sources indicate that, with regards to Ammon's neighbor, Israel, the union of tribes was precipitated, in part, by the threat of an exter? nal state?Philistia, as well as by the threat of other tribes and tribal confederacies, including the Am- monites, Moabites and Edomites in Transjordan. While we don't have sources to provide us with the Ammonite side of things, the first men? tion of an Ammonite king at the head ofthe Am- monites as a people is in reference to the battle against some of the Israelite tribes (Reuben and Gad in Gilead and Benjamin and Ephraim in west? ern Palestine) in a territorial dispute (Judges 9- 12). The rise of a tribal kingdom in Ammon un? doubtedly paralleled the process that the biblical sources outline for Israel (Finkelstein 1988,1995). HISTORICAL BACKGROUND FOR AMMON'S EMERGENCE Historical Sources for LB IB-IIA Egyptian Sources. Egyptian sources, such as the monumental inscriptions of the pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty and various texts such as the Amarna Letters, provide a broad, albeit important, histori? cal context for the sparse archaeological findings of LB IB-IIA Ammon. These sources make it ap? pear that a paramount concern of the Egyptians during the 18th Dynasty was to create a buffer zone in Canaan against the Hittites and other northern powers (Redford 1992: 148-49). Threats from the north?first Mitanni and then Tunip and Kadesh? prompted Tuthmosis III to pursue a vigorous pre- emptive strategy to prevent enemies from threat- ening the borders of Egypt. This was accomplished in part by maintaining an unchallenged hegemony over western Palestine during this time, although the Egyptians were frequently called upon to de- fuse inter-city disputes and rural discord (Bienkowski 1989; Knapp 1989b; Lemche 1988: 83-84). To maintain this hegemony, the Egyptian pharaoh, through his emissaries and on-site admin- istrators, required the mayors of the Palestinian</page><page sequence="170">164 RANDALL W. YOUNKER city-states not only to collect and deliver the an? nual tribute, but also to provision the local Egyp? tian garrisons, furnish contingents of local militia for Egyptian campaigns and to recruit locals for corvee (forced labor; Ahituv 1978: 97; Hopkins 1993: 201). Not surprisingly, the heavy presence of Egypt in Canaan made a significant impact on the local society during the course ofthe Late Bronze Age. In some respects, Egyptian rule appears to have stimulated the Canaanite economy (Bienkowski 1989; Knapp 1989a, 1989b), although there is no evidence that the general population of Palestine benefited from this economic activity. Egyptian records report that Palestine sent a substantial amount of tribute and gifts including metals, woods, glass and manufactured goods. However, none of these items were indigenous to Palestine, suggesting that their agricultural production was geared to trade for these items on the international market after which they were sent on to Egypt. Thus, most of Palestine's agricultural surplus was converted to forms of non-perishable wealth that could be used to support either pharaoh's court or the Egyptian infrastructure in Palestine (Hopkins 1993: 201-2). The diversion of this economic surplus away from the indigenous population had a predictably adverse affect on the countryside. In contrast to the Middle Bronze settlement pattern, Late Bronze Cisjordan did not attain even half of its former sedentary population in cities, towns and villages (Gonen 1984; Bienkowski 1989: 59; Hopkins 1993: 202). The highlands of western Palestine, which had boasted nearly two hundred sites in the Middle Bronze Age, became almost devoid of sed? entary population during the Late Bronze Age (Finkelstein 1988: 339-40; 1995: 356, fig. 4). As Bienkowski has noted, the sedentary population appears to have pretty much abandoned the rural hinterland and frontiers, and what was left was concentrated in the main urban sites that had car? ried over from the Middle Bronze Age (1989: 59). At the same time, however, other Egyptian sources provide descriptions of non-sedentary el? ements of the population that appear to have oc? cupied the highlands just out ofthe reach of Egyp? tian and local urban authorities. One of these ele- ments, known as the shasu (Shasu), appears in numerous references in Egyptian sources (Giveon 1971; Ward 1972; Weippert 1974; Redford 1992: 271). They are first mentioned in a list of prison? ers from the reign of Tuthmosis II, although most references to them seem to date to the LB IIA (the time ofthe earlier Amarna Letters) and LB IIB. Scholars differ on the derivation ofthe word shasu (Shasu). While some have suggested that it might be related to a Semitic verb "to plunder," most scholars believe it more likely that shasu is derived from an Egyptian verb meaning "to wan- der" (Giveon 1971: 261-63; Ward 1972: 56-59; Weippert 1974:433; Redford 1992: 271). The lat? ter meaning certainly matches the Egyptian de? scription of these people who, though their home- land, Shasu-land {ti $lsw), seems to be in Transjordan (Giveon 1971: doc. 6a and 16a; be? low), also appear in a number of other lands, in? cluding northern and southern Palestine, Syria and even Egypt (Giveon 1971: 235-39; Ward 1972; Redford 1992: 273). Moreover, Egyptian com- ments that the Shasu generally live in tents and keep sheep and goats are in harmony with the lifestyle of a nomadic or semi-nomadic people (Weippert 1974: 275). Most scholars interpret the Egyptian sources as depicting the Shasu as a "social class" rather than an ethnic group (Ward 1992: 1166). Accord? ing to the Egyptian sources, the Shasu were di? vided into tribes or "clans" {mhwt) that were led not by a king, but by "chieftains" (ef) (Giveon 1971: 255-57, does. 11,36). The fact that they are depicted in Egyptian art in different costumes (e.g., long dress or short kilt) may reflect membership in different tribes (Ward 1992: 1166). While most seemed to live in tents, some lived in towns (Giveon 1971: 114-15, n. 5). Again, the texts sug? gest that most kept cattle (sheep and goats), al? though some served as mercenaries for Asiatic and Egyptian armies (Giveon 1971: does. 46, 50). Shasu in Ammon? Their ubiquitous appearance at points north (Syria), south (Moab and Edom) and west of Ammon (western Palestine) make it not unlikely that they were also found in or near Ammon as well. Indeed, at Amara West a Ramesses II top-</page><page sequence="171">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 165 onym list (ultimately ofa fifteenth century origin) provides a group of six names in "the land ofthe Shasu" that clearly seem to be located in Edom, Moab and the northern Moabite plateau, which bordered, and at times was included within, Ammon (Giveon 1971:26 and 74; Younker 1994). One place name that occurs in this list, Laban, is the same name as the progenitor of the Ammo- nites and the Moabites mentioned in Gen 19, and may refer to a site just south of Amman (Redford 1992: 272). Specifically, both Abel and Giveon note that in the Notitia Dignitatum there is a list of Transjordanian garrisons from the Byzantine period, one of which is Libona (Abel 1938: 188; Giveon 1971: 76). Abel, Giveon and Redford (1992: 272) each identify the Late Bronze Age Egyptian town of Laban and the Byzantine Libona with Khirbet el-Libben (alternately spelled al- Lubban and el-Libban), formerly a Beni Sahkr village and a station on the Hijaz railway located a little more than 14 km south of Amman and 4 km southeast of Jawa (South; see Abujaber 1989: 94, 137, 145, 233), a location that could be consid? ered within the southern border of Ammon (Younker and Daviau 1993). Unfortunately, the only description ofthe ruins of Khirbet el-Libben is provided by Briinnow and Domaszewski who visited the site sometime between 1897 and 1898; they note only that the ruins extended over a couple of hills (1904: 178). If this identification is valid, however, it places the Shasu close to the southern border of Ammon, if not within Ammon proper. Certainly the lifestyle and social organization ofthe Shasu, as described in Egyptian sources, is compatible with the archaeological record of Transjordan, which extends from Edom northward through Moab to Ammon (LaBianca and Younker 1995). If the inhabitants of LB IIA Ammon were not Shasu, they must have strongly resembled them. As noted above, the archaeological evidence clearly indicates that Ammon at this time was mostly inhabited by non-sedentary people, al? though there is possible evidence of one or two modest settlements (McGovern 1989). Like the Shasu, there is some evidence of contact be? tween Ammon and western Palestine in the simi- larity of some aspects of the material culture (especially some pottery forms), but some dis- tinctiveness also developed. The occasional references that imply an an- tagonistic relationship between the Egyptians and the Shasu may provide some of the background for another Egyptian source that applies to the LB IB?the so-called "Palestinian List" or "topo? graphic list" of Tuthmosis III. A full discussion of this list is beyond the scope of this study (see e.g. Aharoni 1979: 162-63; and Ahituv 1984 for ear? lier studies). However, fifteen names (numbered as sites 89-103) are of special interest in that it has recently been proposed that these sites are lo? cated in Transjordan rather than western Palestine (Redford 1982a, 1982b; Kitchen 1992: 23-25). According to Redford's identifications, sites 92- 96 are actually located within Ammon. Site 92 is cAbil (Nahr ez-Zeraq/Jabbok); Site 93 is ktit, (Gittoth [winepresses]); site 94 mqrpt (fertile de? pression??Baqcah Valley?); Site 95 is cyn (cAin Musa?Amman?); and site 96 is krmn ([Abil] Keramim?Jawa?). Of possible significance is the fact that the reference points for this stretch through Ammon are geographic features rather than settlements. It could be inferred from this Egyptian document that settlements in LB IB Ammon were either rare, avoided by the Egyp? tians, or both (see above). Again, this situation is in harmony with the broader socio-political context of Palestine. As noted above, the commencement of the LB IB period is associated with Tuthmosis III's campaign into Palestine ca. 1457 b.ce. (Weinstein 1981: 12; Redford 1992: 156). The focus of this campaign was western Palestine, although the disruption there would likely have resulted in further de- stabilizing the precarious economy and/or sub? sistence strategies of those people who lived in the marginal zones of Transjordan such as Ammon. However, as also noted above, the exist? ence ofa Tuthmosis III itinerary that possibly in? cludes Ammon proper (Redford 1982a, 1982b; Kitchen 1992), leaves open the possibility that the pharaoh campaigned directly through this region at least once, if not more times, on his way north. Subsequent to the campaign, the Egyp? tians initiated a policy that included "the inten- tional demolition of Canaanite towns and the de- portation ofa sizable segment ofthe population" (Redford 1992: 208).</page><page sequence="172">166 RANDALL W. YOUNKER There has been something of a debate on the impact that this Egyptian campaign had on the population of western Palestine. Many scholars assumed that this campaign created an occupa? tional "gap" in some regions of Palestine (e.g., Wright 1961: 91, 94), while others have thought this gap has been exaggerated and even filled by subsequent archaeological discoveries and Egyp? tian texts (e.g., Weinstein 1981: 12-14). Recent intensive surveys show, however, that there was indeed a significant drop in sedentary occupation, especially in the highlands of Canaan during LB IB (Finkelstein 1994: 174; 1995: 254-55; Bunimovitz 1994: 193; 1995: 324). While the data are not yet complete enough to indicate whether the few LB IA settlements at Amman, cUmayri and Jawa were abandoned or destroyed at the LB IA/IB transition there is little doubt that sedentary life in Ammon was in decline at the time the Egyptians were campaigning in Pal? estine. Certainly, the practice of mass deportations did not encourage sedentary occupation by the highland inhabitants of either Canaan or Ammon. Egyptian documents do indicate that Tuthmosis III deported more than 7,300 people from this gen? eral region, while his son Amenhotep II would carry off an additional 89,600 (Giveon 1971:219- 20; Redford 1982b: 117; 1985: 193). It is interest? ing to note that the Shasu made up about thirty-six percent ofthe Palestinian prisoners brought back by Amenhotep II. As Redford points out, although the latter's tally should not be construed as a cen- sus list, it undoubtedly provides a representative cross-section of the Shasu population that pen- etrated Canaan (1992: 278). Nomadization in Ammon If Redford (1982a, 1982b) and Kitchen (1992) are correct that Tuthmosis III not only campaigned in western Canaan, but also made a least one swing through Transjordan, including Ammon, and if part of the objective of these excursions was the ac- quisition of local folks for work back in Egypt (Redford 1992: 208), this would be expected to have a significant impact on the settlement pat? tern in Ammon. Most of those folks in Ammon (and elsewhere in Transjordan) who escaped Egyp- tian deportation, would likely have decided to abandon a sedentary way oflife for one that would not as likely be subject to Egyptian harassment; that is, they adopted a strategy of "bedouinization" (Joffe 1993: 64) or "nomadization," which is one "form of resistance ... by the rural population to the exploitative undertakings of urban elites" (LaBianca 1990:41-42; see also Finkelstein 1995: 355). The location of their homeland on the Jor? danian plateau during the Late Bronze Age appears to have allowed the Shasu and other non-seden- tary peoples such as the Hab/piru to maintain an existence "at least one step beyond the reach of the Egyptian Empire and international politics" (Hopkins 1993:202; see also Redford 1992:273). Thus, in spite of the massive deportations of Tuthmosis III and Amenhotep II, later Egyptian sources indicate that a large population of Shasu and Hab/piru continued to occupy the highlands of Palestine and Transjordan. The presence in the nearby highlands of these peoples who refused to acknowledge the author? ity ofthe Egyptians or to share in the burden im? posed upon their city-state neighbors would have naturally created an irritating and frustrating situ? ation for both the Egyptian authorities and the Canaanite urban leaders. Not surprisingly, there? fore, one reads derisive remarks about both these people groups (Hab/piru and Shasu) in both Canaanite correspondence and Egyptian records. From the Egyptian perspective the Shasu were, for the most part, rebellious, quarrelsome, unfriendly highwaymen who were "ignorant of the laws of the palace" (Ward 1992). The demands that Egypt placed upon the city-states of western Palestine became increasingly burdensome in an environ? ment of diminishing sedentary population (Bunimovitz 1995: 325). In a climate in which man-power was at a premium in order to meet agricultural production needs, militia service and corvee demands, it is not surprising that urban lead? ers became quite jealous of both their territory and population (Bunimovitz 1995: 327). As Bunimovitz explains, in order to maintain rule and status, great ma? terial investments were needed [by the urban elites]...and thus the burden imposed on the</page><page sequence="173">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 167 subjects became heavier; these subjects, in turn, reacted time and again by deserting the established social system?thereby depleting it (1995: 326-27). Eventually, "the dearth of sedentary popula? tion coupled with the compulsory need to share its meager labor resources with the Egyptian gov? ernment" (see Na'aman 1981:178-79), presented a serious problem for the Canaanite urban elite and generated a vicious circle in which even greater demands were placed upon the remaining sedentary population, increasing the likelihood that they, too, would abandon the system. Many scholars believe that a good number of these people apparently joined the semi-nomadic or nomadic groups such as the Shasu and Hab/ piru who occupied the highlands of both Cis- and Transjordan. The latter region, which was more removed, in particular served as a refuge from both the Egyptians and the city-state mayors of Canaan. The maintaining of a semi-sedentary or non-sed- entary way of life by the Shasu in Transjordan undoubtedly frustrated the ability ofthe Egyptians to control these people as they could the city-states of Canaan. Historical Backdrop to LB IIB/Iron IA? Hab/piru and Shasu Dominance in the Highlands Although they would eventually be eclipsed by the arrival of the Sea Peoples in Egyptian sources, the Shasu of Transjordan (including the region of Ammon) and related non-sedentary peoples such as the Hab/piru in western Palestine continued to dominate the hill country of the LB IIB/Iron Age IA in both Cis- and Transjordan (Redford 1992: 257-80). According to Redford (1992: 274), there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the Shasu had become so powerful during this period that they were able to cut off Egypt's Transjordanian route for a while, thus precipitating a vigorous Egyp? tian response by pharaoh Merenptah. Merenptah's success in Canaan (and Transjordan?), however, was short-lived, for after his death he was followed by four weak rulers who essentially abandon Canaan for the next twenty-five years. During this time, the Canaanite city-states were quite at the mercy of the highland tribes? both Shasu and Hab/piru. As Redford points out, the "cApiru and nomadic dissidents always held the upper hand; to the Canaanite headmen they were 'mighty enemies' (EA 318: 9), and as few as forty were sufficient to capture and destroy 'cit? ies' (EA 185: 47; 186: 50)" (Redford 1992: 268). This would have especially been the case during the twenty-five-year Egyptian decline that fol? lowed the reign of Merenptah (ca.1213-1203 B.C.E.). Resettlement of Hab/piru and Shasu Elements in the Highlands It was most likely during this twenty-five-year hiatus of Egyptian domination in Canaan which followed Merenptah's reign (ca. 1213-1203 b.c.e.) that the LB IIB/Iron IA highland settlements in both Cis- and Transjordan, including Ammon, were founded?a time period that harmonizes closely with the ceramic chronology of these sites (see Stager 1995, 1998). The diminished threat of corvee and taxes during the post-Merenptah pe? riod, combined with pressures in the highlands for pastoral resources (see Kohler-Rollefson 1992:15), would have provided ample motivation for those components of the Hab/piru and Shasu who had previously been sedentary to re-establish small agricultural villages in the highlands as quickly as was feasible. While Redford notes that the high- landers were probably militarily stronger than the Canaanite city-states, it appears that they never- theless chose to avoid pushing into the lowlands during their initial settlement phase. This reticence was probably not caused by a fear of the weak- ened Canaanite city-states as much as by the con- tinuing possibility that the Egyptians might return, which they indeed did during the reign of Ramesses III (ca. 1184-1153 b.c.e.). As noted, this LB IIB/Iron IA settlement pro? cess in Ammon occurs at the same time in the high? lands of both western Palestine and northern Transjordan (ca. 1220-1175 b.c.e.). Settlement far- ther south in Transjordan seems to have commenced a little later, probably because of demographic and environmental factors (see LaBianca and Younker 1995: 406-7; Finkelstein 1995: 354, 357).</page><page sequence="174">168 RANDALL W. YOUNKER This historical reconstruction answers some ofthe questions raised by Bunimovitz (1994) about the relationship of this new highland settlement phase and the assumed societal collapse that the entire southern Levant appears to have experienced at the end ofthe Late Bronze Age (see articles in Ward and Joukowsky 1992, especially Weinstein 1992:142-50; Dever 1992:99-110). Specifically, Bunimovitz notes that the renewed settlement pro? cess in the hill country in both Cis- and Transjordan appears to have begun while the majority of the Canaanite centers were still in existence (1994: 195-96; above). Bunimovitz asks the question that if, as many scholars assume, the collapse of Canaan's socio-political and settlement systems led to nomadization at the end of the Middle Bronze Age (see Finkelstein 1988, 1994, 1995), how could this same process at the end ofthe Late Bronze Age lead to sedentarizationl Instead, Bunimovitz argues that the Late Bronze Age sedentarization in the highlands was the result of increased security provided by the Egyptian authorities "as a consequence ofthe vig? orous measures taken by the pharaohs of these dynasties" including "punitive expeditions against non-sedentary groups" ... "public security was restored, the frontier retreated and non-sedentary groups resettled ... in the highlands" (1995: 328). However, there are a couple of problems with Bunimovitz's reconstruction. First of all, there is a bit of a paradox, or even outright contradiction, with the idea that the very people against whom punitive expeditions are undertaken by the Egyp? tians?the non-sedentary groups of the hinter- lands?would subsequently feel "more secure" as a result of Egypt's punitive raids and would con- sequently settle down. On the one hand, there is the record of Merenptah attacking one of these hinterland (non-urban) groups?Israel (Hasel 1995: 257-71), yet Bunimovitz includes cIzbet Sartah and Tell Beit Mirsim B1-2 among the sites that enjoyed the new security provided by Egypt? sites that he acknowledges are attributed to the Is? raelites (1995: 328). If these hinterland people actually suffered a defeat at the hands ofthe Egyp? tians, it seems more likely that they would have withdrawn even farther from Egyptian control; they would not have settled down to become sub- jected to increased taxes and corveel I would propose a reconstruction that com- bines the historical analysis of Stager (1995,1998) with Joffe's anthropological model (1993:90-91); that is, the highlanders and other non-urban hin? terland peoples were probably local, kin-based sedentary groups with a long tradition of an "anti- urban" ideology who had fled the oppression of Egypt and the Canaanite city-states (Stager 1995: 348; 1998:141) through a process of'avoidance" (Gellner 1981; Yapp 1983; Tapper 1990: 67)?in this case through nomadization (LaBianca 1990)? and who take advantage ofthe first opportunity to resettle when the state and urban polities are weak- ened and no longer as oppressive. Historically, the ideal time for this initial resettlement would have coincided roughly with that period in which the Egyptians began to withdraw from Canaan?that is, during the twenty-five-year Egyptian decline that followed the reign of Merenptah (ca. 1213- 1203 b.c.e.), but prior to the initial arrival ofthe Philistines in 1180 b.c.e. (Stager 1995, 1998). Ammon, which was more distant from the harassment of Egyptian and Canaanite city-state authorities to the west, may have actually begun settling a little earlier than groups in west of the Jordan. Indeed, recent work at cUmayri suggests that the Iron IA site was, indeed, settled a little earlier than sites to the west based on the ceramic assemblage that includes the earliest Iron IA forms and a higher percentage of Late Bronze forms than is typical of parallel sites in the west (Herr 1998: 256-57). Whether this has anything to do with the Israelite tradition that the Ammonites settled in the region first (see Gen 19:38; Num 21:24-26; Deut 2:19) is hard to say, especially since many scholars view these texts as late. However, as Herr notes, the presently available archaeological data do not contradict this possibility (Herr 1998: 258; see also Halpern 1992a: 1138; 1992b: 102-8; Boling 1988). Historical Reconstruction oflron I Ammon There are no references to Ammon in Egyp? tian sources during the Iron IA, although they do note that their Transjordanian routes to the north continued to be menaced by the Shasu. Rather, the Egyptians were distracted by a larger problem in</page><page sequence="175">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 169 western Palestine where their hegemony, includ? ing control over the coastal routes, was threatened by the Sea Peoples during the eighth year of Ramesses III (ca. 1175 b.c.e.). According to Stager (1998: 153), who has proposed, to date, the most convincing absolute chronology for this period based upon Egyptian sources, Egyptian artifacts in archaeological contexts and a ceramic chronol? ogy based on the appearance of Mycenaean IIIC: lb pottery ("Sea People's Monochrome") and "Phi? listine Bichrome" (Stager 1995: 334-36; cf. Ussishkin 1985; Finkelstein 1998), the Philistines first arrived on the southeast coast ofthe Canaan ca. 1180 b.c.e. (Stager's Stage l).7 According to Stager, this first stage of Philistine settlement lasted from about 1180 to 1150 b.c.e. While the Egyp? tians were able to contain the challenge during the time of Ramesses III (see Stager 1995: 344), they eventually lost their grip on Canaan during the second half ofthe twelfth century b.c.e. after the death of this pharaoh (ca. 1153 b.c.e.; Stager 1998: 153). This resulted in the decline ofthe Canaanite urban enclaves as well. However, in the highlands, the process of sedentarization continued, both in Cis-jordan and Ammon. As the threat from Egyptian and Canaanite urban centers disappeared, the Philistines increas? ingly posed a new challenge to the independence ofthe highlanders (Stager's Stage 2, represented by "Philistine Bichrome" ware?1150-1050 b.c.e.). While this primarily affected those living in the west (Israel?!), it caused a chain reaction that eventually affected Ammon. However, this new threat precipitated a new, different reaction by the kin-based countryside that was just settling down. Rather than again reverting to an avoidance strategy by desedentarizing as they had previously done when oppressed by Egypt and the Canaanite city-states, the rural kin-based peoples now chose to resist. There are possibly two reasons for this new tack. First, the rural peoples apparently did not perceive the Philistines to be as great a threat as they did Egypt when the latter was at the height of its power in Canaan. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the kin-based highlands had both grown and developed coalitions that now made them a potent force in their own right. Also, for the first time, the kin-based elements had devel- oped a significant sedentary base quite indepen? dent ofthe old Canaanite urban centers, which had now become virtually powerless. The ability to form large coalitions based on kinship ties (tribal confederacies), along with highland settlements that provided an economic foundation for inde- pendence and rally points for resistance, enabled these rural people to resist effectively initial Phi? listine incursions and attempts at domination for some time. However, Israelite tradition suggests that increased pressure from the Philistines in the west and the Ammonites in the east, eventually motivated the Israelite tribes to unite under cen? tralized leadership. Thus, they made Saul a king. Under Saul and then David, the Israelites were fi- nally able to break and subdue the Philistine threat. In Ammon, meanwhile, the people had appar? ently also coalesced under central leadership, "a king," if Israelite tradition is to be relied upon (Judges 11). Indeed, this tradition suggests that Ammon acquired a kingprior to Israel. While there are no contemporary documents to present the Ammonite point of view, current settlement data (especially from cUmayri) do seem to support the idea that Ammon underwent sedentarization just prior to the peoples in Cisjordan, contrary to pre? vious views (Herr 1998: 256-57).8 This makes sense in view of the fact that Ammon was a bit more removed from the pressures of Egypt and the Canaanite city-states (and later the Philistines) and may have begun settling down just prior to the post-Merenptah hiatus when highland settle? ments in the west began to be established in ear- nest. The growth and increasing competition for land from western (Israelite?!) tribes pushing into Transjordan probably precipitated a reaction in Ammon, similar to that evoked from the Cisjordan tribes when the latter were pressured from the Philistines a little later. The Ammonites firmed up their coalition and united under a king in order to resist the Israelites. Attacks from the Philistines against Israel to the west may have prompted the Ammonites to make incursions of their own against Israel from the east. At any rate, the archaeologi? cal evidence for Iron IA-B Ammon sustains a pic? ture of continuing sedentary growth, and the de- veloping settlement hierarchy supports the emer? gence ofa large, central urban center at Rabbath-</page><page sequence="176">170 RANDALLW. YOUNKER Ammon, supported by several medium-size cen? ters (e.g., Safut, cUmayri, Sahab, Jawa) and nu? merous small villages and farmsteads. Whatever the historical particulars, the Iron IA-B highlanders of both western Palestine and Ammon appear to demonstrate the process of "generative genealogy" wherein large, nonseden- tary kinship groups coalesced into large tribal con- federations, tribal kingdoms and eventually states, albeit, small-scale, secondary ones. As Tapper has pointed out, one of the main variables that can precipitate centralized tribal leadership on a larger regional basis is the activity of an external, supra- tribal entity or state (1990: 66). In the case of Late Bronze Canaan (both Cis- and Transjordan), that external stimulus was provided by the Egyptian state. What is unique in this case is that for the first time in the hitory of Canaan, the "city-state" does not regenerate or come to "resolution" with the kin-based elements, to use Joffe's terms. In- stead, the local kinship groups transform into larger and more complex kinship units?tribal coalitions, confederations and eventually kingdoms or "states"?which come to dominate the landscape. These new socio-political configurations would continue to flourish throughout the Iron Age II. Ultimately, Canaan's old city-state system disap- pears, never to re-emerge again! CONCLUSION In conclusion, the transition into the Iron Age was a social organizational revolution that reversed the historic trend in Canaan dating back to the Early Bronze Age wherein city-states represented the apex of social evolutionary complexity?an apex that dominated the small rural kinship groups. Rather than another phase of "resolution," the Iron Age represents a new social evolutionary trajec- tory in which Canaan's old urban order is perma- nently disrupted and the kin-based elements evolve into a new level of social organizational complex? ity that leave them on top. In the form ofthe Iron II period kingdoms of Ammon, Moab, Edom and Israel, this new trajectory will attain the highest level of social complexity the region had ever seen up to that time, and that would not be seen again (on the local level) until modern times NOTES 1. The information for some parts of this study has been revised and expanded from two previous studies by the author: The Emergence ofthe Ammonites: Socio- cultural Transformation on the Transjordanian Pla? teau During the Late Bronze/Iron Age Transition, PhD dissertation submitted to the University of Ari? zona, 1997), and The Emergence ofthe Ammonites, Pp. 189-218 in Ancient Ammon, eds. B. MacDonald and R. W. Younker, Brill, 1999. The dissertation was done under the direction of William G. Dever, a great teacher and friend whose scholarship is celebrated here. 2. I recognize that there is a chronological overlap be? tween my LB IIB/Iron IA transition and Iron IA proper. This is because the ceramics at some sites in Transjordan have a mixture of late LB IIB forms and Iron IA forms, but lack of stratigraphic precision (in some cases because ofa lack of excavation!) makes it difficult to reconstruct accurately the occupational history. Therefore, for the present, it seems best to assign these sites to a "transitional" period that runs from the very end ofthe LB IIB into the beginning of IronlA. 3. These include the Amman Citadel (Bennett 1979: 159), Tell el-cUmayri (West; Younker et al. 1993), Sahab (Ibrahim 1992), Umm ad-Dananir (McGovem 1986), Tell Jawa (South) (Younker et al. 1990), Safut (Wimmer 1987a, 1987b, 1992), Khirbet Othman (Abu Dayyah et al. 1991: 392), Rujm el-Henu (McGovem 1986), the Amman Airport Structure (Hennessy 1966a, 1966b; Herr 1976), El-Mabrak (Yassine 1983c; Waheeb 1992),HaudUmKharruba, Jebel et-Teweim, Khirbet el-'Edhmah, Rujm Madba'a (Gordon and Knauf 1987: 292), Rujm Beider (Abu Dayyah et al. 1991: 390), Khilda (Abu Dayyah et al. 1991: 391-92), Hesban Site 128 (Ibach 1987), Abu Zibneh (Gordon and Knauf 1987: 292), as well as the King Talal Reservoir Survey sites 1 and 13 (Tell er-Rehil), Area C (Kerestes 1978: 108- 35). 4. With regard to the "hilltop fortresses" and quadratbau structures, it is interesting to note that Fritz originally thought the Amman Airport struc? ture, whose quadratbau plan he clearly recognized, was actually a "military watchtower" similar to the other "towers" that dotted the landscape later in the</page><page sequence="177">THE EMERGENCE OF AMMON: A VIEW OF THE RISE OF IRON AGE POLITIES 171 Iron Age (Fritz 1971). While this suggestion is un- likely for the Amman Airport structure whose con? tents seem to point to a cultic function (see above), the quadratbau does have a "fortress-like" appear? ance and, in general, size and construction technique are not too different from the so-called "Ammonite Towers" ofthe Iron II. Similarly, M. Waheeb's sub? sequent work at El-Mabrak, which also has a quadratbau plan, led him to describe the site as a "fortified agricultural complex" (Waheeb 1992). This description was based on both the walls ofthe rect? angular compound, which were constructed of large megalithic boulders, and the associated finds, which pointed to agricultural activities on the site. Indeed, I would suggest that, based on location, associated artifacts, size, shape and constructional similarities, the quadratbau is a LB IIB/Iron IA predecessor to the qusur, large fortified agricultural estates that are common later in the Iron IB-C (Younker 1989). This conclusion is more convincing when these structures are viewed within the historical context of LB IIB/ Iron IA and compared with similar structures and a similar historical situation during the Ottoman pe? riod. However, this number must not be considered abso? lute since many of the sites assigned to Iron I are based on Glueck's field readings, which in some cases, have been open to doubt (see Franken and Power 1971). Nevertheless, it is clear that during this period a discemable transformation appears to have occurred wherin agricultural settlements sprouted throughout the countryside and the subsistence mode shifted from an emphasis on pastoralism to inten? sive agriculture (LaBianca 1989, 1990). 6. They include Khirbet Morbat Badran, Kirbet Mudmar, Khirbet es-Sweiwina, Tell Siran, Ar-Rwaq, cErjan A, cErjan B, Hleileifeh, El-Mumani, Et-Teleil, Khirbet el-Jamus, Khirbet cErjan, Khirbet Hanotiyeh, Sweifiyeh el-Gharbiyeh, Khirbet Wadcah, Rujm el- Qutnah, Khirbet Mugheirat el Hassan, Khirbet cErjan esh-Shemaliyeh, Khirbet Sakhara, Tareq, Nuwayjis, Swewineh, Jebel Zuhur, Qutnah, Marka, Rujm Brekkah, Khirbet Fahd, Qasr Um Rujum, Hleileifeh North, and Um Zweitineh. 7. Finkelstein (1998) has challenged Stager's recon? struction ofthe dating ofthe Philistine settlement by lowering the date of Mycenaean IIIC:lb pottery as well as the rest ofthe ceramic horizons traditionally associated with the twelfth to tenth centuries b.c.e. Finkelstein's "low chronology" has been challenged by numerous scholars including Mazar (1997,2003), Na'aman (2000), Ben-Tor (2000) and Bunimovitz and Faust (2001). 8. Specifically, Herr reports that Phases 14 to 12 at cUmayri contain a ceramic assemblage that while containing distinctive early Iron I forms (twelfth cen? tury), still included several late LB IIB (thirteenth century) forms, making cUmayri approximately con? temporary with Mount Ebal (Zertal 1987) and Giloh (Mazar 1981, 1990).
