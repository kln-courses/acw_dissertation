<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 36 ) NOVATIANI DE TRINITA TE LIBER-. ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. A sequel to the Author's Essay on the Epistle to Diognetus} THE earliest notice that we have of Novatian's work on the Trinity is due to Jerome. In his Catal. Eccl. Script., after mentioning the well known historical par ticulars of the Schismatic Novatian, he enumerates his various writings, and names lastly the present work in these words: "et de Trinitate grande volumen; quasi ImTo/jLrjv operis Tertulliani, quod plerique nescientes, Cypriani existimant." It was supposed, however, that this could not have been the existing work, because the latter mentions Sabellius, and it was supposed that the heresy of Sabellius did not rise at so early a period. This was inferred from the letter of Dionysius of Alexandria given by Eusebius, vii. 6, in which he speaks of it as prevalent in Ptolemais, and describes it as if it was new to him. It might have been new to him, but we now know from the Philosophumena that Sabellianism was known in Rome at the time of Zephyrinus and 1 In this Essay, Hermathena, No. XXII., the reader is requested to add, in p. 340, line 16, after xii., substitu ting a comma for the full stop, as follows : " unless we bring down this passage to a period later than Epi phanius. In his account of the Archontics, Haer. xl., ch. 9, Ed.

He does not trace this further back than one Peter who was anathematized by himself. But this would not explain the verbal coincidences noticed already. This late heresy seems to have been con fined to parts of Judea and Armenia."</page><page sequence="2">NOV ATI AN I BE TRINITATE LIBER, ETC. 37 Callistus. So far there is no reason to doubt that the existing book is what Jerome speaks of. We also possess a work of Tertullian, that against Praxeas, of which the title is Liber De Trinitate. Nor is there any evidence of another work by Tertullian on the same subject. But as Novatian's grande volumen is longer by a seventh part than the work of Tertullian, it is not an epitome of it in the common meaning of that term, nor does it pretend to be so, or mention Tertullian at all. Hence Jerome's quasi only expresses his own imagination. I take it that he made a careless comparison of the two books, but observed that both treat of the Regula Veritatis, eo nomine, and follow the usual order of the three Persons, dealing with the same heretics, and necessarily using the like argu ments. And then observing that Novatian omits all reference to Montanism which is treated of in the first chapter of Tertullian, he pronounced the work of the former an epitome of the latter on this account. For the present I shall only ask it to be kept in mind that Jerome says Novatian's book was commonly thought to be Cyprian's. I pass now to another notice that Jerome gives of this work, in which his unsaintliness is strikingly displayed. The occasion was as follows :â€”Rufinus, in his tract on the Adulteration of Origen's works (apud Origen, by Lom matzsch, vol. xxv.), having given some examples of the adulteration by heretics of Greek writers, proceeds to give some instances in the case of Latin writers. That there should be no uncertainty about the facts, he says, "res quae sunt adhuc nostrae memoriae retexam," that is within living memory. He gives three instances, of which the first relates to Hilary of Poitiers after the Council of Rimini, anno 359. A document of his was vitiated and then put back into his desk, and when called for was found to be heretical, which led to his having to withdraw</page><page sequence="3">38 NOV ATI AN I DE TRINITATE LIBER: from a Synod. Jerome treats this as an invention of Rufinus and a calumny against Hilary. The next ex ample is as follows : " Certain heretics who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit," had incorporated with the Epistles of Cyprian as his the work, libellum De Trinitate of Tertullian, "reprehensibly written as far as pertains to the truth of our faith," and circulated the collection at a cheap price in Constantinople, that they might give for their heresy the authority of Cyprian. And though this fraud had been detected, yet many believed that the work was Cyprian's. To this Jerome, adv. Rufin, lib. ii., replies as follows : " The calumny against the Confessor (Hilary) is, however, to be tolerated. He passes to the glorious Martyr Cyprian, and says that the book of Tertullian, of which the title is De Trinitate, was under his name com monly read by the heretics of the Macedonian party in Constantinople. In which accusation, mentitur duo, he tells two lies, for neither is the book Tertullian's, nor is it called Cyprian's, but Novatian's, with whose title it is inscribed, and the peculiarity of the style demonstrates the author's speech." For this brutal language Jerome has not the shadow of a justification in the statement of Rufinus. He did not specify the heretics, and I think I shall show that it was not the Macedonians that he had in view. That the book in question, if it was Novatian's, was called Cyprian's we have Jerome's own admission in the Catalogue as we have already seen. What he calls in that grande volumen is less applicable to Tertullian's book, which Rufinus calls Libellum, which is considerably shorter than Novatian's book of the same title; and his remark as to the peculiarity of the style applies alike to Tertullian and to Novatian, as compared with the other existing writings of Novatian, namely, his work De cibis Judaicis, and possibly the letter from the Roman Clergy to Cyprian during the vacancy before the</page><page sequence="4">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 39 election of Cornelius when Novatian himself expected to be elected. So far for Jerome's reply to Rufinus. But now we have to consider what heresy Rufinus had in view. First, there is nothing in either treatise, Ter tullian's or Novatian's, that could be thought in any way to favour the Macedonian heresy touching the nature of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Divinity and distinct personality of the Holy Spirit is fully maintained in both. And next it is pretty clear that the Macedonian heresy had not come into existence as the specific doctrine of a sect at the time to which Rufinus refers. To show this we must look to the indications of time. The story of Rufinus has itself no indication of time. But immediately after he proceeds to say, " I shall add farther an example of one such transaction, quod memoriae quidem recentioris est,commissae autem nequitiae antiquum satis." It is plain that a very considerable time must have elapsed between the story just told and what he is now going to relate. This has to do with Pope Damasus at the time that there was deliberation held concerning the reception of the Apollinarians. This deliberation must have been prior to the Council at Rome, in 374, when they were condemned. Now Macedonius was deposed at Constantinople in 360, not for heresy but for murderous tyranny; and Socrates expressly says that it was after his deposition and banishment that he propounded the heresy that goes by his name, and it could not all at once have acquired a sufficiently numerous party to make it the subject of Conciliar condemnation, which did not take place till the second General Council at Constantinople, anno 381. And it is not likely that, until the question had become the subject of general discussion, that the party at Constantinople should have resorted to the trick of fasten ing upon Cyprian a work which after all did not help their cause, and that at the cost of circulating largely a very</page><page sequence="5">40 NOVA TIA NI DE TRINITA TE L IB Ell: extensive book containing the work in question with Cyprian's Epistles at a very small price. And I venture to think that this must have been too near 374 to justify the words of Rufinus that a transaction of this date was memoriae quidem recentioris as compared with the date of the preceding transaction. But who then were the heretics that "blaspheme against the Holy Spirit"? I think Tertullian's Libellns De Trinitate, as Rufinus calls it, supplies the answer. It was not Macedonians, as Jerome says, but Montanists, far enough from the Macedonian notions, blasphemously identifying Montanus with the Paraclete, and ascribing to the Holy Spirit the ravings of Prisca and Maximilla, which to the orthodox would naturally sound very blasphemous. Let us see what Tertullian says in this book entitled Liber De Trinitate, namely, his work against Praxeas, whom he represents as introducing the Noetian heresy into Rome, the very opposite to the doctrine of the Trinity. While the subject of the book is the doctrine of the Trinity as against the Patripassionism of Praxeas, he takes occasion in the first chapter to vent his indignation against Praxeas for having simultaneously with the in troduction of the Noetian heresy hindered the Pope, it must have been Eleutherius, from acknowledging the new prophesying. In regard to the Patripassian doctrine he says of Praxeas : " He first introduced to Roman soil this new kind of perversity from Asia, a man turbulent also in other ways ; moreover inflated by the boasting of martyr dom, on account of the sole, simple, and brief tedium of a prison ; even if he had delivered his body to be burned he would have profited nothing, not having the love of God, whose charismata also he fought off. For the then Roman Bishop already acknowledging the prophesyings of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, and from that acknowledgment conferring ' Peace ' on the Churches of</page><page sequence="6">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 41 Asia and Phrygia, the same man by asseverating false hoods against the Prophets themselves and their Churches, and by defending the authorities of his predecessors, forced both to recall the Letters of Peace already issued, and to give way from his purpose of receiving the charismata. Thus he effected, procuravit, at Rome two great affairs of the Devil; he expelled prophesying and he introduced heresy, he put to flight the Paraclete and he crucified the Father." In the beginning of ch. ii. he speaks of himself as now more instructed by the Paraclete, deductorem scilicet omnis veritatis. This I take to mean the carrier on of all truth with special reference to the new prophesying. And so again in xxx., having men tioned the second coming of our Lord, he adds: " He in the meantime hath poured out the Holy Spirit; a gift received from the Father, tertium numen divinitatis, et tertium nomen majestatis, the preacher of one Monarchy, but also the interpreter of the oeconomy, if any one will receive the words of his new prophesying, and the carrier on of all truth," deductorem omnis veritatis. This identi fication of the Holy Spirit with the Montanist Paraclete was the blasphemy of the heretics of Rufinus who wished to gain for these notions the authority of Cyprian by passing off this work of Tertullian as Cyprian's. And these were the non recte scripta of Tertullian that Rufinus mentions. It is to be added that Montanism did not expire for a long time, as we learn from Jerome's Epistle to Marcella that it was in his time still alive and trying to gain converts. I may add that to the Praescript. adv. haer., written by Tertullian before his adoption of Mon tanism, there is appended a list of heresies which is now recognized by the learned to be a translation of the Syntagma of Hippolytus, whether adopted by Tertullian himself or not. In this, lii., we find mentioned two heresies secundum Phryges. One of these called Kata</page><page sequence="7">42 NOVATIANI DE TRINITATE LIBER: Proclum is Montanism, the other, Kata Aeschinem is Noetianism, for it taught that Christ himself is both Son and Father. These two are described as blasphemy, and of these the Montanist was a blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. It is not, therefore, without example that Rufinus should have described the heretics that ascribed the De Trinitate of Tertullian to Cyprian as blasphemous against the Holy Spirit. In the edition of Tertullian by Junius, I find mentioned in the list of deperdita a work De Trinitate. That there was such a work different from Tertullian's existing Liber De Trinitate, seems to have been imagined only to ex plain Jerome's statement in the Catalogue that Novatian's De Trinitate was a kind of epitome of Tertullian's. As the existing book is smaller than Novatian's, and is certainly not epitomized by the latter, some other work, of which Novatian's was an epitome, had to be imagined. If such there was, and Novatian's was known to be an epitome of it, we might understand Rufinus calling this Tertullian's Libellus in opposition to the larger work De Trinitate. In that case Jerome's mentitur would still be unwarranted. But now, in the first place, Novatian's book is very complete in itself and betrays no symptom of epitomizing. And next, if Novatian did make such an epitome, we should expect to find something of the style and manner of Tertullian, while Jerome himself appeals to the peculiarity of the style in proof that the book was Novatian's and not Tertullian's, without a hint then that it was only an epitome of Tertullian, which, in all fairness, he ought to have done instead of absolutely accusing Rufinus of falsehood. But if we suppose that Novatian made a quasi epitome, as Jerome suggests in the Catalogue, merely transferring the thought and subject-matter; but wholly abandoning the phraseology of Tertullian, we should naturally expect to find him writing in his own</page><page sequence="8">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 43 respectable Latin, such as his other remains exhibit, instead of adopting a very barbarous Latinity such as we find in the De Trinitate. It seems to me incredible that he should have done this. And even if we suppose that this was the Libellus that Rufinus mentioned, we should be equally at a loss to find what there was in it that could make any heretics, who in any way blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, find support for their opinions. We may, I think, therefore, absolutely reject this theory in trying to explain the difficulty. Jerome, however, was right in speaking of the pecu liarity of the style of this book of Novatian's. And the unlikeness of that to the style of other writings of Novatian, of which we have one book at least of sufficient extent to make the difference clear, requires to be ac counted for. And it is the object of the following pages to suggest some considerations which may explain so strange an incongruity, while we have strong evidence that the existing book is in some measure due to the hand of Novatian. Certainty in a matter of this kind may be well unattainable, and yet there may be sufficient evidence to render a conclusion probable. The first thing to be noticed is the very barbarous air of the work as a Latin composition, and the strong im pression it makes of being a translation from Greek. On a general survey of the book this can only be a subjective feeling. Without pretending to any special discernment or any authority whatever in such a question beyond what is due to very extended reading, through a very great number of years, of authors in the Greek of those ages, I can only say this appears to me to be the case. I speak only of wide and habitual reading of post-Christian Greek. I take the case of Irenaeus, and I could as well believe that the rude Latin of the bulk of his works, which we know to be a translation from Greek, was the original</page><page sequence="9">44 NOVATIANI BE TEINITATE LIBER: style of a Latin writer, as that this work of Novatian was the natural Latin of one whose own original and natural Latin we know to be so different. The same conclusion is to be derived from the nume rous Scriptural versions to be found in it. For though these might characterize a Latin composition by a Greek writer who was not familiar with the genius of the Latin language, yet if we may trust the only evidence we have, namely, Jerome's, that it was the work of Novatian, it must certainly have been a translation from Greek, as Novatian was a Roman, distinct even from the African Novatus, though confounded with him by the Greeks; and his Latinity, as we see from the other writings of his that we possess, was not tinged with any tendency to Greek ways of expressing himself. I shall first give some Grecisms mentioned in the notes of F. Junius, Franek., 1597. Ch. i. Solidamento caeli] crrtpeiiifiari tov ovpavov. Vulgo firmamento. I may add that this word is used more than once, and as the usual firmamentum is also used, the solidamentum is plainly derived from the Greek word. Ch. iii. Animosâ€”abruptos, anoTUfiove, praefractos, per vicaces. Ch. iv. Non aliunde occurrit homini malum nisi a bono Deo recessisset] ovk liWoOev rj ano tov ctyadov Oeov airotTTijvai. Argute reponit Latinius recessisse. The aliunde would in Latin require recedendo, while the gerundic infinitive is Greek. Ch. vii. Deus caritasâ€”necex hoc Dei substantia caritas expressa est]. Graeca phrasi utitur pro eo quod est, non eo intelligi oportet substantiam Dei nomine caritatis ex pressam esse. Ch. x. Neque ilium (sc. Christum) qui aetheream sive</page><page sequence="10">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 45 sydeream, ut alii voluerunt haeretici, voluit carnem]. Voluit carnem, a volvendo non a volendo, hcvXivSriae.

Legendum autem esse reperitur. Deus constitutus reperitur does not want the esse. Its absence, frequent in this writing, is a decided Grecism. Ch. xx. Erroris semper est abrupta dementia] cnroTo/uog, airopp(o%. The sense is precipitous, for the sequel is et non est novum, si usque ad periculosa descendunt. Ch. xxviii. Quae omnibus modis fieri habent] e^ovai â€¢yivtaQai. I shall now mention such examples as I have observed myself. And I first notice a tendency to double negatives. Sometimes these are equivalent to an affirmative, and only show a predilection for this form. Thus in ch. i. we have ne non for ut, like the Greek /n) ov. In x. we have it again, and in the next line ne nullam. In other cases the double negative strengthens the negation as in Greek. Thus in x. we have non followed by nec when it is super fluous. " Nec nomen Dei proprium possit edici, quoniam non possit nec concipi." In Latin this last nec would more usually be Del. In ch. xiii. we have non sivit nec vestes consumi, followed by several clauses similarly beginning with nec. And in xxviii. they are transposed, " nec non etiam subdidit illud quoque." We cannot take the 'nec non' as a single word, 'necnon,' for the sense of also is suffi ciently, and more than sufficiently, expressed by the ' etiam' and ' quoque,' and we must translate, " nor did he not also subjoin this too." The frequency of this seems to me to indicate a Greek original. Still more such a phrase as in ch. xii., aut nonquid non est vobiscum ? This ' nonquid non' is very unlike a Latin writer, but represents the Greek</page><page sequence="11">46 NOVATIANI BE TRINITATE LIBER: apa ov or firiri ov. And again we have in xxx., aut nun quid non et Christus Deus est? Just before there is the simple ' nunquid.' These seem simply to represent [ir/Ti and fir/Ti ov, or apa and dpa ov. In ch. i. we have the following : ne non etiam ipsis quoque deliciis procurasset oculorum, " lest he should not even have procured the very delight of the eyes." The dative of the thing procured is certainly not pure Latin, which would properly be ' delicias oculis.' He might have had before him the verb npovouv, followed by e7ti ry rpvfyyj or tnl r(j) rjSti, and then the Latin not supplying a suitable preposition, he was content with the simple dative. In the same chapter we have ' sacramentum' used for mystery in the largest sense of the latter word. Of the works of creation, he says, " immensa caelorum spatia et sacramentorum infinita opera." The word is used frequently in this work to denote mysteries of every kind, as the mystery of the Incarnation, the Passion, the wrestling of Jacob with the angel. But it is used nowhere in the proper ecclesiastical sense. But this had associated the word with the Greek pvurripiov, and he accordingly repre sented this word in other senses by 'sacramentum.' In xiv., "sacramentum passionis," and in xviii., in reference to the Incarnation, " dispositionem istam angelus videns, et ordinem istum sacramenti expediens," may be compared with to fivcTTr)piov rrig oiKovop'iag, of Hippolytus, Theophan., Lagarde, p. 37. In this case oiKovopia is used in its patristic sense of the Saviour's human state. In chapter ii. we read of the greatness of God, " qui est sublimitate omni sublimior." And this is followed by eighteen other terms similarly constructed and presenting similar alliteration, which is a good instance of the habit of running into series that pervades this work. In the course of this enumeration we find " omni virtute viritior." Now, in so long a series there was no reason why an</page><page sequence="12">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 47 original Latin writer should have, without necessity, introduced a term which necessitated the coining of such a word as ' viritior' to preserve the alliteration. But he had no help for it, if he found in his original naariQ aptrijQ apdojv, or lvaptT(l&gt;TtpoQ. Farther on we have ' omni bonitate bonior,' though in some copies 'melior' appears, no doubt, to avoid the solecism of' bonior.' I venture to think, that having already invented ' viritior,' he would not stick at ' bonior' in order not to spoil the alliteration in one in stance. He might have had before him Tracrt/Q ^jorjoroTjjroc XptJOTOTCpOe. In chapter i., and all through the work, the Creator is called ' conditor omnium,5 and passim we find ' conditio' for ' creation,' as also in the Latin version of Irenseus. As condo represents ktiÂ£g&gt; in its proper sense of'build,' so ' conditor' and ' conditio' are used to represent and KTt'dte, the words commonly used in Greek with regard to ' creation.' In chapter iv. we have, " Deus enim, quicquid esse potest quod Deus est." Here 'potest' is not used to express the power of God, but what is the meaning of the word 'God.' In this use 'potest' is not Latin, but represents the Greek Svvarai, commonly used in the sense of ' means.' The ' quod est' is the common artifice of later Latin writers to express the Greek article used materially, as the grammarians say, and occurs elsewhere in this book. The writer intends, " whatever is the meaning of the word 'God.'" In other parts of this chapter 'quod est' is used to represent the Greek well known phrase to ov, and in that sense the Latin phrase is scarcely intelligible. And these phrases are several times used in this chapter, plainly showing the embarrassment of the writer in translating a Greek original. Again, we have in this same chapter, " quod enim natum non est nec mutari potest." Here there is no reference to the birth of Christ, and the word is used</page><page sequence="13">48 NOV ATI AN I DE TRINITATE LIBER: in the sense of 'created,' and is plainly an imitation of â– yevvt^roQ or â– ygvrjroe. And at the close, speaking of the necessary connection of immortality and incorruptibility, we have: " invicem sibi et in se connexione mutua perplexa, et ad statum immortalitatis vicaria concatenatione pro ducta." Here the word ' vicarius ' in the sense of' mutual' is plainly not a Latin usage, but would represent some such Greek word as afioi^aiog. In chapter vi., with reference to anthropomorphic representations of the Deity, we read: " Rationem enim divinae Scripturae de temperamento dispositionis cognos cimus. Parabolis enim adhuc secundum fidei tempus de Deo prophetes loquebatur quomodo populus capere poterat." This passage seems to betray a Greek original. 'Temperamento dispositionis' is unintelligible as Latin, but would represent rije SictOiatojc; rr\g oiKOvofxiaq. And a Latin writer would scarcely spontaneously use the word ' parabolis ' in the sense of ' figures of speech.' And ' tempus' is used in the sense of Katpoc- Farther on, when hearing or seeing is said of God, this is only figurative. " Quae concreta non sunt sentire non possunt." Here ' sentire,' used to express the use of senses, seems to be more Greek than Latin. It might represent aladririKog tivai. In chapter x., of the substance of our flesh, we read, " quae divinis manibus exstructa est." Here again we have the Greek htTiaQr), 'was built.' In chapter xi. of Christ, " hominem ilium nudum et solitarium probare." In this use of ' solitarius,' several times thus employed, not properly expressed according to Latin usage, we have a substitute for the Greek jv/xvoq kuI \pi\og. The writer seems to have thought that ' solus,' which he uses once in the same connexion, did not exactly express what was intended. In chapter xii. we find ' sanitatum signa,' where signs</page><page sequence="14">ITS PROBABLE HIS TOBY. 49 of health are not intended, but miracles of healing; we have the Greek &lt;r/j/xÂ£ta, used to denote miracles. In chapter xv., " Ex quo manus ponere figuram et formam futuram passionis ostendens." This is used of Jacob's blessing the sons of Joseph. ' Manus ponere ' seems to represent the Greek, to xfpoOersiv. The words are used substantively, but a Latin writer would not probably have, of himself, used the infinitive. Again, we have in the same chapter, " unius hominis potestatem." This, as Latin, would mean, the power possessed by one man, as ' potestas' only takes a genitive in this sense. But here it denotes the power of Moses over Pharaoh. It is a Grecism. K^aro? takes a genitive of the person over whom the power is exercised. In chapter xvi. we read " pignerata in illo divinitatis et humilitatis videtur esse concordia." Here ' pignerata,' in the simple sense, of assured without reference to any kind of pledge would scarcely have occurred to an original Latin writer, but seems to have been derived from the Greek iyyvau, which is commonly thus used. And in xxx. the same Greek word is again translated by a still more unusual manner of speaking. " Nostram fidem, qua unus Deus et per Scripturas promittitur, et a nobis tenetur et creditur." The word ' promittitur' is surely not Latin in this case. It plainly represents the Greek iyyvarai. In xvii. we read "hoc ipsum in gloriam Dei patris succurrere asseritur." Here ' succurrere ' is unlikely as a Latin word, but is evidently used for avarpe^etv, which is more suitable to the intended meaning. In chapter xix. we have "ut principalitas nominis istius Filius Dei in Spiritu fit Domini qui descendit et venit, ut sequela nominis istius in filio Dei et hominis sit." Here ' principalitas' is used in the sense of' principium.' This abstract is manifestly due to the Greek ap\v, which signifies both beginning and principality in the sense vol. x. E</page><page sequence="15">50 NOVATIANI BE TllINIT ATE LIBER: ' authority.' The sequela plainly shows the beginning is intended. In the next sentence, ' dispositionem istam angelus videns,' we have represented the Greek ciafhmz or oiKovofila, as in several other places. In xx., "generositatem immortalitatis," and "generositas verbi Dei," are not like an original Latin work. ' Genero sitas' thus used betrays the Greek tvytvua. At the close, "frangitur potestas mortis, ubi intercedit auctoritas im mortalitatis" seems to represent e^ovuia as opposed to Svva/MQ. ' Auctoritas ' is used in an unlikely way. In xxvi., we have the phrase " quae malum ratio est ?" This interjectional use of 'malum,' answering to our "What the plague," or a coarser expression, is hardly suited to so serious a discussion, but seems to have been adopted to express the Greek t( ?rorc, or t'l Stittote. It occurs more than once. In xxviii., at the beginning, we read : " dum haereticus quasi oculo quod am gaudet propriae veritatis et luminis amisso." This is very obscure. The ' quodam ' of course represents the enclitic tivi. Then it seems strange to make a man rejoice in the loss of an eye of proper exactness and of light. I fancy the writer did not understand a Greek original from which he was translating, and that he had before him tivi xaipeirriQ Ictag aXrjOua^, kcu tov &lt;Pu&gt;toq cujHtfdvq, and that taking as a passive, he rendered it etymologically by 'amisso.' The proper meaning would be, " an eye that forsakes or neglects its true vision and the light," instead of carrying the genitives back to ' oculo,' whereas they are the proper case after a&lt;piz/uvw. At the end of the same chapter we find as follows: " A field large and wide will be opened if we shall desire more fully to drive about this heretic, since ' duobus istis locis quibusdam effossis luminibus orbatus, etc.'" Here we cannot construe 'quibusdam' with 'luminibus.' For though we might say ' oculo quodam,' as before, in the</page><page sequence="16">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 51 singular, to speak of a man having some eyes punched out would be absurd. Of course ' quibusdam ' represents rim, and belongs to ' locis.' He has done enough by putting out such eyes as his adversary had, by some two out of many possible passages, the two which were adduced in this chapter. In the last chapter we have again ' natus' and ' in natus' several times, besides ' genitus,' all derived from yevvr^Tog and ctyevvrtTog. And near the close we have the following : " vis divinitatis emissa, etiam in filium," and " tradita et directa rursum per substantiae communionem ad patrem revolvitur." This word ' directa,' in the sense of 'porrecta' as in the next sentence, is very unlike a Latin usage, but would have come from the Greek SiciTetvo/itvoQ. And then ' substantiae communionem,' which is good Latin, seems to represent the Greek OjUooixTtorj}?- Origen has the word ofioovaioe, the idea of which is exactly expressed by Novatian's Latin, this language having no corresponding term.1 These many indications of a Greek original might, perhaps, be multiplied, but as I have already said, the general air and character of the whole treatise, which must be judged by the discernment of the reader himself, seems to me to betray the work of a very literal translator. The style and manner are very unlike what might be expected from a native Roman, as they are wholly unlike Novatian's own Latin as exhibited in his work De cibis Judaicis. And then, if it is admitted to be a translation from Greek, we know of but one important Greek work on the subject of this treatise that would be in the hands of a Roman of Novatian's time, namely that of Hippolytus, who wrote in Rome his lost work against Artemon. Our next step must be to inquire if there are any indica tions of style and ideas sufficiently resembling those of 1 So in Philos. x. 33 of the Logos, Sib Ka\ Bebs ovcrla virapxwv 6eov. E 2</page><page sequence="17">52 NO VA TIANI BE TRINITA TE LIBER: Hippolytus, to confirm the identification of Novatian's De Trinitate with this lost work of Hippolytus, lost, I mean, in its original form, even if preserved in its substance by Novatian. Let us then inquire if there is anything in the general style and manner of Hippolytus that resembles the De Trinitate, and if we can observe any similarity of thought that may add probability to this supposition. And first, as to style and manner, we find that the habit of running into continuous series of words, phrases, and clauses similarly constructed, which is a marked peculiarity of Hippolytus, pervades the De Trinitate in an equally re markable manner. Thus the Theophany of Hippolytus sets out with a beautiful description of the works of creation in an enumeration of the heavenly bodies and terrestrial objects, all intended to lead up to the excel lencies of water preliminary to its use in Baptism. But all this is quite useless, except for ornament, to the writer's purpose. In like manner the De Trinitate sets out with a like description of the works of God in creation, pursued in a similar manner of enumeration, having no bearing whatever on the doctrine of the Trinity, and merely serving for ornament, but betraying a like mental habit. And this is rendered the more distinct by the absence of any kind of imitation, and the independent way in which the particulars are described. I shall ex hibit them in parallel columns :â€” De Jrinitate: " The rule of truth exacts that first of all we believe in God the Father and Lord Omnipotent, that is the most perfect creator of all things; who suspended the Heaven in lofty sub limity, consolidated the earth in laid down mass, diffused the seas in re laxed fluidity, and arranged all these, Theophany of Hippolytus : " Beautiful and beautiful exceedingly are all the creative works of our God and Saviour, both whatever the eye beholds and whatever the soul thinks of, and whatever reason interprets and whatever the hand turns about, and whatever thought encompasses and humanity comprehends. For what</page><page sequence="18">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. both adorned and full with proper and suitable furnishings. For both in the solidament of Heaven he hath raised up light-bearing risings of the Sun, hath filled the whiteshining globe of the Moon with monthly increments of its orb for the solace of men, and also kindled the rays of the stars with flashes of glittering light, and He hath willed all these to go round the circuit of the world in legitimate courses, to make for the human race days, months, years, signs, seasons, and all utilities. On the lands also he hath lifted up the loftiest mountains to a peak, and hath cast down the valleys to the lowest parts, hath spread plains in loveliness, hath established herds of animals use fully for various services of men. He hath also made solid the oaks of the forest to be profitable for human uses, hath drawn forth fruits for food, hath disclosed the mouths of springs, and poured them into streams to glide down. And lest He should not also have provided delight for the eyes, He hath clothed all with the various colours of flowers for the pleasure of beholders." beauty is more multiple than the Heavenly disk ? What appearance more many flowered than the earthly encompassment ? What more swift to run than the solar chariot ? What more graceful yoke than the lunar star sign ? What more worthy of admir ation than the many spotted museum of the stars ? What more rich for pro duce than the seasonable breezes ? What mirror more unstained than the light of day ? What living being more noble than man ? For beautiful and beautiful exceedingly are all the creative works of our God and Saviour. But what gift also is more needful than the nature of water ? For by these waters all things are both bathed and nourished and purified and moistened. Water begets the dew, cheers the vine; water brings to perfection the standing corn, water brings the cluster into berries, water makes the olive tender, water sweetens the palm tree, water makes the rose to blush and the violet to blossom ; water nourishes the lily with golden chalices." The description of the excellencies of water and its operation in the vegetable and floral world by Hippolytus is specially comparable with the concluding particulars of the springs and floral decoration specified in the adjacent passage of the De Trinitate. Now, while these passages are quite independent, we see the same manner of prolonged enumeration, the same succession of the several terms, the items for the most part identical, and their beneficial uses similarly pointed out, though somewhat variously expressed. And when we remember that both enumerations, beyond the fact that</page><page sequence="19">54 NO VA TIA NI BE TBINITA TE LIBER: they are of the works of the Creator, have no bearing on the subject of which the writer treats; on the one hand no special appropriateness to the great doctrine of the Trinity, and on the other to the use of water for our Saviour's baptism beyond its cleansing use, and might both have been omitted without injury to the writer's argument, we see that they are plainly merely rhetorical ornament, and manifestly exhibit the same habit of mind. It is the gratuitousness of their introduction which dis tinguishes these descriptions in the present case from other similar enumerations of the works of God which ancient writers were fond of when their object was to deduce the necessity of an all-wise Creator from the order and mani fest design exhibited in the world of nature. Very similar, for instance, is the beautiful passage in the Octavius of Minucius Felix, xvii. But there the description forms the essential ground of the argument, and each particular has its proper place as an instance exhibiting the divine wisdom of the Creator. In the cases we have now before us, it is merely rhetorical ornament that is the occasion of their introduction, and it is this that makes them pertinent to the present inquiry. Near the close of the Theophany, Lagarde, p. 44, we have the following addressed to Catechumens: "This is the water which participates in the Spirit, by which man re generated is quickened, in which also Christ was baptized, in which also the Holy Spirit descended on him in the form of a dove. But this is the Spirit that from the beginning was borne upon the waters, by which the universe was put in motion, by which creation stands and all things are quickened, that wrought in the prophets, that flew down upon Christ. This is the Spirit that was given to the Apostles in form of fiery tongues; this is the Spirit David sought, saying, ' Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.' Of this also</page><page sequence="20">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 55 Gabriel said to the Virgin, ' The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.' By this Spirit Peter uttered that blessed voice, 'Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. By this Spirit the rock of the Church was consolidated. This is the Spirit, the Paraclete sent for thy sake that he might make thee the child of God." Now, if we turn to the De Trinitate, chap, xxix., we find in describing the offices of the Paraclete, as it were a larger edition, constructed in the same fornrof concatenation, in which like particulars, like references to Old and New Testaments, like events, and like operations are enumerated, and the several mem bers joined together by like forms. I do not copy it, for it is at least four times the length of the former. But any reader can see for himself that it seems to be the work of the same hand, and to proceed from the same enumerative habit of mind. I shall not extend the comparison farther in this particular, as through the whole the resemblance is patent, but proceed to notice similarities of thought as distinguished from form. The passage in chapter i., De Trinitate, on the creation of man, his possession of freewill and consequent sub jection to law, may be compared with the Philosoph. x. 33, where Hippolytus speaks of the creation of man. And here we are at first met by an apparent disagreement of thought. The De Trinitate, after describing the creation of the world in the manner already quoted, proceeds thus: "Post quae hominem quoque mundo praeposuit, etquidem ad imaginem Dei factum : cui mentem et rationem indidit et prudentiam ut Deum posset imitari; cujus etsi corporis terrena primordia, caelestis tamen et divini halitus inspirata substantia." Here plainly the reference in the distinction between the'terrena primordia' and the 'divini halitus' is derived from Gen. ii., while the 'praeposuit' comes from Gen. i., where the dominion and subjugation is, of</page><page sequence="21">56 N0VATIAN1 DE TRINITATE LIBER: course, only in title, but in practice, prospective. Now if we turn to Hippolytus we read thus :â€”o Se yevo/usvog avOpijoirog Ztjiov avre^nvtriov r)v, oxjk ap%ov, ov vovv e'xov, ovk iirivoia Kal i^ovaiq, icat Svva/xei ttcivtmv Kparovv aXXa SovXov, kuki navTa e'x01' ivavrla. Here this last word has been misunderstood. It does not mean, as Bunsen and Words worth suppose, ' all contrarieties.' The definite article shows that the meaning is ' all the opposites' of the particulars just mentioned. And I think Hippolytus speaks only of the state in which man must have been found at his first coming into existence, yivo/xevog, a state quite infantile, little different from a mere animal capable of voluntary action, as yet devoid practically of all exercise of dominion, of all practical good sense, all contrivance by which he might acquire dominion which his bodily strength could not give him. All this was only possible by time and experience, and he seems to mention these particulars to account for the facility with which he fell into evil. For he immediately adds, oq tip avTt^ovmov xnrapxeiv to kcikov tTriytvvi}. The disagreement is, therefore, only apparent. The De Trinitate speaks of the faculties and the intended condition of mankind. The Philoso phumena speaks of the practical state in which man must have been when first brought into existence. In other respects there is a remarkable congruity. Thus the De Trinitate says: "He willed him alone to be free, and lest liberty unrestrained should fall back into danger, he im posed a commandment." Then the Philosophumena says: " Who being possessed of freedom, a law was prescribed by God, not without reason. For if man was not able to will, and not will, a law would not have been prescribed. For a law will not be prescribed to an irrational animal, but a bridle and a whip." And here the words aXoyy Zwy show that ov vovv 's\ov above did not mean deficiency of the faculty of understanding. And when the De Trinitate</page><page sequence="22">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 57 says, " mandatum posuit," it adds, "quo tamen non inesse malum in fructu arboris diceretur, sed futurum, si forte ex voluntate hominis de contemptu datae legis praemone retur."1 With this compare Hippolytus in the same place. To the words already quoted, " by being possessed of free will he generates evil," he adds, " not anything accom plished by accident, eic avfifiefiiiKOTog, if you do it not. For by willing and cogitating something evil, evil is so called." Wordsworth has mistaken the meaning of the writer, rendering his words thus : "He, in having free will, gener ates evil accidentally, but not in any degree taking effect, unless thou doest it." Here he makes the author say that the generation of evil was accidental, whereas the very opposite was intended. In this first chapter we have a striking coincidence with another work of Hippolytus, namely the 7rcpi tov 7ravTUQ. " For neither are the regions which lie beneath the earth devoid of arranged and ordered authorities. For there is a place whither the souls of the pious and the impious are brought, futuri judicii praejudicia sentientes," having a sense of judgments anticipatory of the judgment to come. Then Hippolytus, Lagarde, p. 68 sqq., tells us of Hades, a place " underneath the earth ; over which have been set angels to watch, distributing temporary punishments according to the actions of each." Then there is the lake of fire into which none have yet been cast, "until one sentence shall be pronounced on all according to their deserts, and the unrighteous be further condemned, nooaicpiOum." This word, ' farther judged,' implies a 7rpo/cpÂ«ne, or ' praejudicium futuri judicii.' And further on he tells us, that by the expectation of the judgment to come, they are already virtually punished. 1 Compare with this Diognetus xii. of the tree of knowledge, ov rb tt)s yud)(T6C05 avaipe?, aAA' tj irapaKoij a vaipei.</page><page sequence="23">58 NOVATIANI DE TRINITATE LIBER: Here we have a clear correspondence with the De Trinitate in its peculiar phrases. In De Trinitate vi. we read : " What is immortal, what ever it is, that same is one and simple and always. And for this reason that it is one, it cannot be dissolved, since whatever that same is, being put outside the law, 'jus,' of dissolution, is freed from the laws of death." Then in the Philosophumena, x. 32, speaking of creation, Hippolytus says: "Somethings are of one substance, fiovoovtria, some of two, some of three, some of four he bound together. And the things of one were immortal, for solution does not attend them. For that which is one, ro 2v, shall never be dissolved, but the things of two, or three, or four are soluble, wherefore they are also called mortal. For this hath death been called, the solution of things that were bound," together he means, of course. In De Trinitate xii. he winds up in this way with reference to the denial of our Lord's divinity, and its opposite extreme of Sabellianism : " Only that whether they will call Him Father or Son, they who are wont to say that Christ is only man must needs fall away from their own heresy, though against their will, while compelled by the very facts they begin to bring Him forward as God, whether they shall wish to call him Father, or shall wish to call him Son." In a like manner of speak ing and arguing, Hippolytus, in Adv. Noet., Lagarde, p. 51, having mentioned different heretics, says: " Even against their will they have fallen into this, that they shall confess the One to be the cause of all things; thus, therefore, even not wishing it, they concur with the truth." This closely similar manner of winding up an argument 1 ad hominem ' is very significant. In chapter xvi. the writer of the De Trinitate says: " Though I am hastening to other matters, I think this ought not to be passed by." This manner of speaking</page><page sequence="24">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 59 occurs several times in this treatise; and the readers of the Philosophumena will recognize a like way of speaking by Hippolytus, such as ovk okv/jctiu Xtyeiv and similar phrases. In the same chapter, speaking of the death and resurrec tion of our Lord, we read : " Induitur autem et exuitur homo, quasi quadem contexti corporis tunica." So also Hippolytus, De Christ, et Antichrist., Lagarde, p. 3, says : u When the word of God, being without flesh, put on the holy flesh from the holy virgin, he was as a bridegroom, having woven for himself a garment for the suffering of the Cross." The weaving and the garment representing the flesh of Christ are identical in both passages. In chapter xix., where the deniers of the divinity of Christ are represented as misapplying the words of the Annunciation, " That holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God," the writer of the De Trinitate meets this in a manner that reminds us of what Dollinger calls a paradox of Hippolytus. " He did not say, as we have just expressed, ' wherefore that holy thing which shall be born of thee,' but he added a con junction. For he said, 'wherefore also that holy thing that shall be born of thee'; that he might show this, that not primarily that holy thing which is born of her, that is this substance of flesh and body, is the Son of God, but consequently, and in the second place; but primarily the Son of God is the Word of God incarnate by that Spirit of which the angel relates : the Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. For that is the genuine Son of God, who is from God Himself, who, while He assumes that holy thing, and annexes to Himself the Son of Man, and lays hold of and transfers to Himself, by his own connexion and associated mixture shows and makes him to be the Son of God, which he was not naturally: so that the origination, principalitas, of this name, Son of God, should be in the</page><page sequence="25">60 NOVATIANI BE TRIN1TATE LIBER: Spirit of the Lord which descended and came, that the sequence of the name might be in the Son of God and Man, and consequently he might fittingly become the Son of God, whilst he is not primarily the Son of God. Wherefore, the angel seeing ' dispositionem istam, et ordinem istunc sacramenti expediens, . . . distinctionem posuit dicendo : propterea et quod, etc.'" In connexion with the concluding part of this passage I shall quote the sentence from the tract of Hippolytus, Adv. Noel., which Dollinger gives as expressing what he calls his paradox, oiirwe /dvoTT]piov olKOVOfilag ck irvtvparog aylov fjv ovtoq o Xoyot; Kcii irapQivov cva vibv Otov anipyaaafxevug. Here we have fj.v&lt;jT))piov to compare with ' sacramentum,' oIkovo/mci with ' dispositio,' and the operation of the Holy Spirit in both. But Dollinger has mentioned another passage in the same work that still more has " the sound of a paradox," to use his expression. With reference plainly to such an an ticipatory announcement as in the second passage, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," he says, Lagarde, p. 54: "What Son of His own did God send down through the flesh, but the Word whom He addressed as a Son, because He was afterwards to become one r But He that is called Son assumes the name of loving affection to men. For neither without flesh and by Himself was He a full, tcXeioq, Son, although full Xoyog, being onlybegotten; nor could the flesh by itself without the Word exist as such, by reason of having His composition, Bia to tv Xoyq riiv ovaraaiv 'txuv&gt; the Word. Thus, therefore, he was manifested one full Son." Here, what seems paradoxical is the distinction between the Word, as the Only Be gotten, and a Son in the full sense of the term. The question is only as to the propriety of the term ' Son ' in the strictest sense as one of human affection, while the Aoyoc is reckoned as being before the Incarnation. But though this distinction is not so explicitly marked</page><page sequence="26">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 61 in the De Trinitate, the two writings seem to me to pro ceed from the same point of view, and to indicate the same authorship. In the De Trinitate, chapter xxii., the writer insists on the word unum, as distinguished from unus, in the text, " I and my Father are one." He says : " In saying ' I and the Father,' he distinguishes his own proper person as Son from the paternal authority, not merely by the sound of the name, but also ' de ordine dispositae potestatis." These last words are very unlike what would be used by an independent Latin writer, but seem to be a translation of some such words as we find in Hippolytus, Adv. Noet., in reference to the same text, Lagarde, p. 49 : /ui) ttavreg iv aHj/na tufiiv Kara rÂ»;v ovalav rj rrj icai rrj SiaOtoeL rÂ»je ojuo^oiuae iv ytvoiitOa. " In the same way the Son that was sent, and not known by them as being in the world, confessed that He was in the Father Suva/ua ^laOiaei." The copulative here is not in the MS., and we might as well read Swanewg SmOtait, which would exactly correspond to the Latin words above quoted. But, at any rate, both thought and phraseology are Hippolytean. If we proceed now to De Trinitate, chapter xxiii., we find the following: "Immortalitas divinitati socia. Be cause, both divinity is immortal, and immortality is the fruit of divinity. Every man, however, is mortal, but immortality cannot exist from the mortal. Therefore, from Christ, as a mortal man, immortality cannot spring. But, He saith, He who shall keep my word, shall not see death for ever. Therefore the word of Christ affords immortality, and through immortality ' praestat divini tatem.' " Now, let us compare with this what we find in the last page of the Philosophumena. " Fiyovaq yap deog, for whatever things you have suffered being a man, these assign to the fact that you are a man. But whatever things pertain to God, these God hath promised to afford,</page><page sequence="27">62 NOVATIANI BE THIN IT A TE LIBER: 7rapexeiv, praestare, ore OewroiiiOric, having been made im mortal." It would not be easy to find two passages in two different works of the same writer, except by direct quotation, in more exact agreement of thought and expression. The De Trinitate devotes chapter xxix. to the Para clete. It sets out by saying that " the order of reason and authority of the faith admonishes us that we believe also in the Holy Spirit formerly promised to the Church, but bestowed at the fixed opportunities of the timesâ€”He is not new in the Gospel nor newly given"; the writer then proceeds to enumerate through the entire chapter a long series of personal operations and acts of a person distinct from the Father and the Son. I have already noted this as a kind of enlarged edition of a passage copied from the Theophany of Hippolytus. What strikes one as remarkable is that in a treatise of thirty-one chap ters, only one should be devoted to the third person of the Holy Trinity. The same brief treatment, in comparison with the extent of his writings, is also to be found in the case of Hippolytus, while there is the remarkable agree ment just mentioned in the places in which there is any extended discourse on the Holy Spirit's operations. The reason seems to be, that as yet there was no distinct heresy touching the Divine Spirit, as there was in regard to the Father and the person of our Lord. If the De Trinitate, therefore, represents a work of Hippolytus, it is entirely in the spirit of his other works in regard to this subject. The heretics on either side, whether " confound ing the persons," as Noetus and Sabellius, or " dividing the substance," like Artemon, seem to have left the question of the Holy Spirit in abeyance, as with neither party was He attacked as a distinct personality, and it was in attacking on either side the nature of Christ that they sought to</page><page sequence="28">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 63 establish their opinions, the nature of the Holy Spirit following their views as a matter of course. The writer of the De Trinitate, having completed his contention against the heretics, begins chapter xxx. by saying : " Et haec quidem de Patre et de Filio et de Spiritu Sancto breviter sint nobis dicta." He now pro ceeds to discuss an objection equally proceeding from both sides, "ut omnis a fide nostra auferri possit haeretica calumnia." The objection was that the orthodox view destroyed the unity of the Godhead. Of course the words I have quoted might have been used by any orthodox writer. But the word 'calumny' seems to indicate more of a personal reproach, than a mere objection in argument. And though, of course, no great stress can be laid on this point, yet it is not to be forgotten that Hippolytus tells us that in his contentions with Zephyrinus and Callistus, he was himself reproached with being a ditheist. Of the latter, he says, Phil. ix. 11, " He used to miscall us ditheists, violently vomiting out the poison that was secretly hiding itself within him." The contention being mainly in regard to the relation between the Father and the Son, and the doctrine of the Holy Spirit being, in this discussion, left in abeyance, would seem to have occasioned the use of the term ' ditheist,' instead of' tritheist,' which afterwards came into use. It is in this chapter that we find, I believe, the earliest use of the long afterwards famous comparison of Christ crucified between the two thieves. And the subject of the discussion in this chapter is resumed in the next. But in the next chapter, xxxi., which forms a kind of peroration to the whole work, De Trinitate, we find the writer brought into more distinct connexion with Hippolytus. I shall first pick out the essential points of the De Trinitate which explain the writer's view of the relation between the Father and the Word, or Son :â€” " God the Father, then, is the instituter and creator of all</page><page sequence="29">64 NOVATIANI DE TRINITATE LIBER: things.â€”From whom 'quando ipse voluit sermo filius natus est,' which is not taken" (understood) " in the sound of smitten air, or the tone of a voice forced from the internal parts, but is acknowledged in the substance ' prolatae a Deo virtutis.' He then, since He was generated by the Father, is always in the Father. But I say always, in this way, not that I may prove Him ungenerated, but generated." In the text itself these sentences and clauses are repeated, but they are extracted literally, only I have used the word ' generated ' to represent the Latin ' natus,' which the writer evidently understood in this sense. We have to remark, on these sentences, that the writer held the doctrine of the generation by an act of will; but while he uses the expression ' quando voluit,' he takes care to make it plain that he does not intend any point of time, qualifying the word 'quando' by 'aliqua ratione,' and ' quodammodo,' consistently with being before all time, and ' semper.' The phrase ' ante omne tempus' plainly represents the Greek npi rwv alu&gt;vu)v. But the distinction between this expression and awaiBiog belongs to the discussions of later times. This is plain from his saying that the Son must have been always, else the Father would not have been always Father. But he plainly holds a succession in order, though not in time, and a sub ordination in authority. For he adds further on, that " the Son does nothing ' ex arbitrio suo,' nor acts by his own counsel, nor comes from himself, but obeys all the paternal commands and precepts." Now, let us compare with these particulars what we find in the Philosophumena, x. 32, where we read, " One God, the first and sole Creator and Lord of all things, had nothing contemporaneous." This, he explains, is not infinite chaos, etc. And having discussed this as against the ancient philosophy, he resumes in 33 :â€”" He, therefore, alone, and God over all, first twoi/Oeic; airoytvvq., generates</page><page sequence="30">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 65 not word as voice, but (Ao-yoe) as the indwelling reason, Aoyia/uog, of everything. Him alone He generated from things existing, ovtojv, for the existing, to ov, was him self the Father from whom was the cause for things coming into existence, ytvo/utvoie, to be generated. The Word was in Him, bearing the will of Him who begat, not without knowledge of the Father's thought, ivvoiag, for a/xa ry tK tov yevvriaavTog 7rpoc\0uv, he hath voice in himself." These sentences closely resemble those of the De Trinitate, both in words and in thought. The ivvotidug implies the 'voluit' of the Latin; and that Hippolytus so intended is plain, for farther on, speaking of the human Creation, he says : " For if he willed to make thee a God, he was able; you have the example of the Word." The distinction of the Aoyoe from the sound of voice is identical in each. And the ' processit ex patre ' of the Latin corresponds with the ek roil yt.wriaavTOQ irpoe\6tiv of the Greek. While the " substantia prolatae ex Deo virtutis," and the " sub stantiae communio " at the close, agree with the words of Hippolytus in the same section, " Out of Him, himself is the Word alone; wherefore also God, being God's sub stance, 01icria Otov." We miss, in the Philosophumena, the cautious phrases by which the De Trinitate avoids the supposition that the generation of the Son was not eternal. Hippolytus was here addressing pagans, and had not in view the questions raised by the heretics with whom the De Trinitate was contending. But he simply says: " The Word of God, the first begotten Son of the Father, 17 irpb iu&gt;(T(j)6pov (j&gt;w&lt;j(j&gt;6pog rpoovt) administers all things." Priority to all creation is as much as he is concerned with insist ing on to his pagan readers. But it is hardly fair for Dollinger, Hip. et Callist., p. 210, to say that Hippolytus makes the Son to have been " before time (irpoaiuvtog), but not eternal (atSiog)." Dollinger betrays an inclination to disparage Hippolytus, but the distinction between these vol. x. F</page><page sequence="31">66 NOVATIANI DE TRINITATE LIBER: words is an anachronism as applied to an author so long before it came historically into consideration. The abso lute manner in which the 'ex voluntate' is expressed in both writings, belongs to the same early period of the contro versy. The later Fathers adopted a more cautious and qualified way of speaking on this subject : " nec ex voluntate nec ex necessitate." It was to avoid this latter idea that the former was affirmed at an earlier period, to avoid the supposition of an independent and unoriginated existence as opposed to the monarchic nature of the Father. And if we look to the sequel of what I have quoted from the De Trinitate, it is evident that it was to repel the notion of ditheism which Hippolytus tells us his adversaries laid to his charge. In the words above quoted, " ex quo quando ipse voluit, sermo processit," are we to take 'quando' as 'when'? In Hippolytus, where Creation is spoken of, we have ots eOeArivev. But he has, in reference to the generation of the Ao-yoe, no indication of time beyond what maybe involved in the past participle ivvotiGug. But this seems to denote precedence in the order of reason and causation rather than of time. In immediate operation all cause and effect are simultaneous. In the Latin words just quoted we have two propositions with different subjects and two active verbs, and I think we would not strain the expression too much, if we took ' quando ' in the sense of our ' since,' since the Father himself willed it, the Word proceeded, where ' processit' is equivalent to the npor/Xdev of Hippolytus. And if Novatian's Latin is, as I think it manifestly is, a trans lation from Greek, ' quando' would probably represent the Greek tnst^ri. And we shall presently see that he does use the same word in this passage when it must have the meaning of' since.' I shall now proceed to show that this phrase, and the meaning intended, was employed with special reference</page><page sequence="32">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 67 to the allegation of ditheism. I shall resume, where I left off, giving only the essential words in Latin. " For he that is before all time must be said to have been always in the Father; nor can a time be assigned to him who is before time. For he was always in the Father, lest the Father should not be always a Father. Because the Father also in some way, ' aliqua ratione,' precedes, because it is necessary that he should in some sense, ' quodammodo,' be prior as he is father, ' qua pater sit.' Since, in some manner, ' aliquo pacto,' He who knows no origin must needs antecede him who has origin, at the same time that he is lesser, ' minor,' whilst he knows that he is in Him, having an origin because he is generated, ' nascitur,' and ' per patrem quodammodo,' though he has origin ' qua nascitur, vicinus in nativitate' whilst he is generated, ' nascitur,' out of, ' ex,' that father who alone has not origin." I fancy we should translate " per patrem vicinus in nativitate," by " closely diffused throughout the Father," and that this way of speaking answers to the tvSiaOerov of Hippolytus, x. 33. The writer then proceeds: " He there fore ' quando' the Father willed proceeded out of the Father : and he who was in the Father, proceeded out of the Father: and he who was in the Father, because he was from the Father, was subsequently with the Father because he proceeded from the Father, to wit. that divine substance whose name is the Word, by which all things were made and without which nothing was made. For all things are after himself, because they are by himself. And justly he is before all things, since,' quando,' all things were made by him who proceeded out of Him by whose will all things were made. He is God therefore proceeding out of God, constituting a second person, but not taking away from the Father this, that God is one. For if he had not been generated, ' natus,' being unbegotten, ' innatus,' compared with Him who was unbegotten, an equality F 2</page><page sequence="33">68 NOVATIANI BE TRINITATE LIBER: being exhibited in each, he would make two unbegottens: and so he would make two gods if he had not been generated, compared with him who was not generated, and being found equal, not having been generated, they would justly have made two Gods, and in this manner Christ would have made two Gods, if he were without origin, being found as Father, and himself principium of all things as Father, making two 'principia,' would have consequently exhibited to us two gods also." Here the word ' principium' represents the Greek apxnâ€¢ And, in this last sentence and what immediately follows, the writer turns back the accusation of ditheism upon the Noetians who charged Hippolytus and the orthodox doctrine with ditheism. The whole argument is intended to maintain the monarchical principle, the sole apx^ Â°f the Father. And the charge made against Hippolytus per sonally would have naturally led him into all this minute argument; and so we may see in this something to corroborate the supposition that the De Trinitate is really a translation from his work on the same subject. And I have gone into this discussion at length partly to clear Hippolytus from Dollinger's accusation, and partly to show the appropriateness of it to his times. I have trans lated rudely for the sake of exactness. The De Trinitate begins with the " Regula Veritatis," introducing the faith in one God, the Father, repeats the same phrase when introducing the Second Person, chap ter ix., and has it again in chapter xxv. The author evidently has the creed in view, such as it existed in his time, in Hippolytus Kavu)v aXriOeiag. So Irenseus at the close of I. i (Feuard., p. 41) has the " Regulam Veritatisâ€” quam per baptismum accipit," where the Baptismal Creed is plainly intended. The phrase used by Tertullian was ' Regula Fidei,' and probably this was the familiar Latin expression. But as Hippolytus was the scholar of</page><page sequence="34">ITS PROBABLE HISTORY. 69 Irenaeus and familiar with his writings, from which he extracts largely in the Philosophumena, it is not without significance that we find Irenaeus's expression in the De Trinitate. Novatian himself would probably have said ' Regula Fidei,' which, if not familiar at Rome, he would have known from Tertullian, either directly or through his African coadjutor Novatus. Let us compare the following :â€” De Trinitate i., first sentence. " Regula exigit veritatis ut primo omnium credamus in Deum patrem et Dominum omnipotentam, id est rerum omnium perfectissimum conditorem, etc." IreNjBUS, i. xix., at commencement. " Cum teneamus autem nos Regulam Veritatis, id est, quia sit Unus Deus omnipotens qui omnia condidit, etc." I shall here add another slight indication that the De Trinitate originated with an author of Greek rather than of Latin education. In quoting St. John i. 3, Greek writers as a general rule close the sentence with ovSh 'iv, joining the o ytyovtv with the sequel. On the other hand, the western writers are wont to join these latter words to the preceding sentence. This text is quoted several times in the De Trinitate, but always the o yiyovev is omitted. But as Tertullian always ends with 'nihil,' we cannot make much of this argument, and the paucity of Latin writers of this early age makes the usage of the time uncertain. The De Trinitate plainly belongs to the same stage of the controversy as carried on by Hippolytus, a stage far earlier than that of Arian times.1 I think I have shown that it is a translation from a Greek work in a Latin very unlike the spontaneous Latin of Novatian to whom alone there is any ground for attributing it. And we only know of one Greek writer of that time whose work on this subject 1 Professor Swete has informed me that Harnack mentions that Hagemann contests the Novatian authorship, and assigns it to the time of Zephyrinus, that is of Hippolytus in his prime.</page><page sequence="35">70 NOV ATI AN I DE TRINITATE LIBER. was likely to fall into his hands, and which it would be desirable to make available to the Latin speaking peopleâ€” no doubt the majority of Christians in Rome. And as I have shown copious similarities of style, manner, and thought, with the known writings of Hippolytus, perhaps we may not unreasonably assume that this is a version of his lost work against Artemon, just as we have a version of his ^vvTayfia attached to Tertullian's work, " Praescript adv. Haereticos." At any rate I offer this to the judgment of the learned. J. QUARRY.</page></plain_text>
