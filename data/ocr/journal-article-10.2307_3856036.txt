Unas, last king of the Fifth Dynasty in the Old Kingdom, reigned from approximately 2375 to 2345 B.C. Though not so imposing a work of architecture as others of the royal pyramids, his tomb was called in (N ^its time "Perfect Are the Places of Unas," and today it is still an important monument of the archaeology of ancient Egypt. As the first C::e ^of the pyramids to bear inscriptions in its interior, it is one of !bW^I othe oldest literary documents not only of Egypt but of mankind itself. The volume contains Piankoff's annotated translation, his intro- I. duction, and a complete photographic record of the texts on seventy plates, with ten other illustrations and plans of the pyramid. 1968. 132 pages. $12.50 Other volumes: * Volume 1, THE TOMB OF RAMESSES VI.
