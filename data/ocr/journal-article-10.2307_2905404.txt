<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Loosening of Tongues: From Narrative Economy to Women Writing Mdria Minich Brewer "de plus vastes et subtiles syntaxes" Annie Leclerc For interpreters of twentieth-century literary texts, the notion of a 'crisis in narrative' is hardly a revelation. We read and describe with relative ease texts of fiction that contain a multiplicity of nar- rative voices, dissolution of characters, and perturbations in the logic of events and temporal developments. The challenge to nar- rative constraints in modern texts may be seen to stem from a discontinuity created between essential terms: process without as- signed Finality; multiple textual effects without an identifiable Cause; writing that possesses neither a simple Origin nor End; signifiers without immediate access to a privileged Signified. But the adequacy of such a purely descriptive way of understanding the 'crisis' has been questioned in recent discussion on narrativity now being engaged in French and American theory.1 The critical function of narrative has been recognized as determinant in con- texts that previously appeared to lie outside any limited definition of narrative, such as the discourses of history, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. In moving beyond the traditional curtailment of narrative, certain critical discourses have discerned the taut web of relationships that exist between narrativity on the one hand, and power, desire, and knowledge on the other. Women's writing and its theories are essential elements in both the crisis and the gen- eralization of narrative. As I will argue, women's writing challenges narrative closures as well as the limits of the concept of narrativity</page><page sequence="2">1142 MARIA MINICH BREWER in ways that go yet further to reveal pervasive narrative determi- nations. The initial studies on narratology that sought to provide struc- tural models of narrative functions tended to be restricted to a genre corpus such as the folktale, short story, novel or myth. The encompassing law of genre classification provided the frame for analysis of narration, yet this law itself was not included in the analysis. As a result of this framing, narratology came to be per- ceived as the analysis of stories, a limiting view that served to mar- ginalize the problems of narrative and restrict their implications. Even now, narratology is generally assumed to deal primarily with texts of a fictional genre. The ultimate ambition, however, of struc- turalist narratology modelled on Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic distinction between language and utterance (langue and parole) was to provide a general, even universal model of all narrative func- tions. Roland Barthes expresses this desire for a far more general narratology in his claim that the goal of structuralist analysis is to "master the infinite occurrences of utterances (parole) by suc- ceeding in describing the language (langue) from which they derive and on the basis of which they can be generated."2 Narrative discourse for Barthes is not purely literary-"inter- national, transhistorical, transcultural, the narrative is simply there, as is life itself."3 Yet in contrast to this sweeping view of narrative, structuralist analysis adopted a distinctly more limited model. The structuralist analysis of the recit was based on the fun- damental hypothesis that one can rediscover in narrative discourse the operations of the major functions of something as simple as the basic sentence, a hypothesis held by Algirdas Greimas, Tzvetan Todorov, and, at one time, by Barthes.4 The narrative is seen as an immense sentence, and, reversing the chiasmus, the sentence as a small narrative.5 Their relation is at once specular and ana- logical. Such a relation between the categories of narrative and those of the minimal sentence is both seductive and not without consequences for interpretation. By adopting it uncritically, struc- turalist studies of narrative tacitly accepted the concept of identity inherent in a syntax that sets up the linguistic 'subject' in relation to its objects. Furthermore, in that the analogy makes narrative and the sentence a specular representation of each other, it works to cut the narrative off from its actualizations and contexts. The narrative of grammar and the grammar of narrative operate in such a way as both to generalize and reduce narrative discourse. A</page><page sequence="3">M L N 1143 transcultural or universal view of narrative has no difficulty in limiting narrative, since the two gestures of theory (generalization and reduction) are absolutely compatible. They belong to a single economy of narrativity according to which the basic model of nar- rative can appear only beyond cultural, ideological, and historical instances. Yet, paradoxically, the identity of the syntactical subject as agent (or actant in Greimas's terms), an identity to which nar- ratology clings, is inevitably defined not only by grammar but also by precisely these supposedly extra-narrative instances that have been evacuated. As a result, culture, ideology, and history, as forms of discourse, continue to impinge upon any attempt to define the linguistic subject. Barthes later recognized that the push to discover the laws of narrative discourse, to find the minimal units of discursive syntax, tended to "reduce discourse, to miniaturize it as an example of grammar."6 This reduction is a serious one, because understanding discourse as an example of grammar results in excluding the ques- tion of its referentiality. By grammar, I mean what Paul de Man defines as the set of relationships that generate the text and yet operate independently of its referential meaning. He writes axiom- atically, "just as no text is conceivable without grammar, no grammar is conceivable without the suspension of referential meaning."7 This does not mean though that the question of refer- entiality can be ignored. "The logic of grammar generates texts only in the absence of referential meaning, but every text generates a referent that subverts the grammatical principle to which it owed its constitution."8 By reducing narrative discourse to a grammatical model, structuralist narratology suspends the productive textual relation between an a-referential set of logical relations and a re- ferential meaning that is generated as a supplement by the text. Thus the narrative process is contained and marginalized not only by the law of genre but also by a narratology that reduces textual effects by cutting them off from their discursive contexts, practices, and purposes. By seeking exclusively after a narrative syntax, such analysis decisively excludes the ideological, philosoph- ical, and historical determinations of narrative. When narratology does attempt to account for the contextual, it does so in terms of narrative conventions and codes. Yet their capacity to account for social, historical or contextual differences always remains limited by the original formalist closure within which such codes and con- ventions are defined.</page><page sequence="4">1144 MARIA MINICH BREWER What I referred to earlier as a crisis in narrative is in fact the staging of narrative's subversion of its own laws, constraints, and presuppositions. This challenge to narrative pervades not only lit- erary texts but also the domains of history, philosophy, and insti- tutions of knowledge in their narrative determinations. Yet so long as one understands these domains exclusively as systems and struc- tures, ignoring their narrative determinations, one suppresses major questions that the concept of narrativity necessarily raises: who or what speaks, from where, to whom or what, to what end? The authority or mastery of the narrative subject continues to be exercised in analyses that stress structure and system. They dissi- mulate the discursive positions that in fact provide a place from which authority is voiced. It is imperative at this juncture to forego the temptation of setting up 'subjectless' systems in order to analyze narratives if we are to question the authority and identity of the full, unified, transcendental subject which continues to impose it- self through such systems and structures. Ultimately, as discursive apparatus, narrative would be seen not so much as a form through which ideology and its representations are reproduced, but rather as that which itself produces them. A step towards the reconsideration of narrative is provided by Louis Marin. For him, it is the present ruined state of the "mon- ument" of narrative history that allows him to examine critically the discursive situation grounding the complicity between narra- tive and power. The discourse of truth reveals itself as that which seeks to dissimulate the discursive position from which it is spoken, for truth's absolute power depends on its being stated, without, however, anyone uttering it. ("Logos seulement, e'nonciation sans enonciateur.")9 Yet in his reading of the historiography of the classical age, Marin shows that the so-called 'laws of history' are in fact "the contracts of the narrative representation of history."'0 He elaborates the discursive apparatus of historical narrative in which the narrator's position is closely bound up with the desire of power (and power's desire). Nevertheless, the writing of history also un- dermines the discourse of mastery that it supposedly serves. Nar- rative transforms the desire for/of power into strategies whose po- litical effect is to entrap power by revealing its discursive precon- ditions."1 Structural theories of narrative or fable are unable to account for these narrative strategies, for by describing codes and their functions, these theories risk reaffirming and consolidating the "power of the code" and, one might add, the codification of power.</page><page sequence="5">M L N 1145 While the historical focus of Marin's study may limit what he can say about narrative in the modern period, the work of Jean- Francois Lyotard provides precisely such an opening onto post- modernity. For Lyotard, the post-modern is defined by a crisis in narrative in which their prevails a suspicion and incredulity with regard to the "meta-narratives" of knowledge and legality. Today, the pre-eminence of narrative forms in formulating and dissemi- nating traditional knowledge is a thing of the past, yet narrativity still tacitly informs even those systems of knowledge that appear to be freest of it.12 Nostalgia for lost meaning in post-modernity is in fact a nostalgia for a purely narrative form of knowledge. In his La Condition post-moderne, Lyotard focuses on the narrative pre- conditions for the transmission of knowledge. Narrative transmits more than a certain content; it is a vehicle for "the group of prag- matic rules that constitute the social fabric."'3 Having de-empha- sized content, Lyotard explores the ways narrative functions to validate and legitimate knowledge. He argues that narrative pro- vides a definition of what may legitimately be said and done in culture, and, since they are an essential part of culture, that nar- ratives are themselves legitimated in this way.'4 The problems of narrative that these theories displace and re- distribute have significant implications for understanding narra- tive as a discourse of authority and legitimation. If, as Marin claims, the authority of the discourse of truth depends precisely on the discursive apparatus remaining hidden, then one might imagine that to demystify the discourse of truth one had only to reveal the mediations of language and the discursive subject. But in doing so interpretation encounters a further silence and a deeper efface- ment of discourse. For what is dissimulated is not only the discur- sive apparatus of the subject of truth but its gender and narrative situation as well, to which interpretation risks blinding itself, thereby consenting to that strategy of dissimulation. To break with the (feigned) silencing of the universal subject of truth requires that the constitutive function of the (real) silencing of women's discourse be articulated and invalidated wherever it occurs. The contemporary crisis in narrative, and its accompanying de- stabilization of the subject of discourse and the power structures legitimating its utterances, has taken a particularly significant course in recent women's writing in France. Problems of narrative have been removed from the aesthetics of formalism and been brought into the sphere of the social, epistemological, and ideo- logical. Yet women's writing ought not to be assimilated too readily</page><page sequence="6">1146 MARIA MINICH BREWER with the general history of the narrative crisis of which it is nev- ertheless a part. With the retreat of narrative closure comes the possiblity of re-examing the relation not only between narrative and authority but between narrative authority and women's situ- ation in its system of representation as well. In the mixed genre theory-fictions of writers such as Helene Cixous, Madeleine Gagnon, Luce Irigaray, and Annie Leclerc, what we find is not only a vigorous refusal of stereotypic representation of women in narrative, but, more importantly, the analysis of narrative dis- course itself as a form that functions to perpetuate the exclusion of woman from discourse.'5 The problematic notion of woman's discourse, or an kriturefem- Mine (Cixous), or a parole de femme (the title of a text by Annie Leclerc), is a major concern today in both the theory and practice of women's writing. To some degree, certain recurring motifs can be taken to exemplify a new expressionism in women's writing that seeks to give voice to the feminine: the exploration and affirmation of woman's sexuality, her body, her desire, and her fictions. Yet women's writing has also become the focus for a thoroughgoing questioning of language and narrative representation, of which such new forms of expression are only a part. For if one simply understands such writing as the replacing of one conventional con- tent and its set of themes (woman as object of male narration) with another (woman as subject of her own narration), then one has not yet tackled the difficult and more encompassing problem of exposing the ideological narrativizing of women. The task is to recognize, in the discourse of psychoanalysis, history, and philo- sophy for instance, the means by which these authoritative nar- ratives of knowledge have excluded women's discourse. In other words, the purpose is neither to produce another narrative content that would be specifically or essentially feminine, nor to tell an- other story that might ultimately only repeat the narratives that have been rejected. Women's writing that affirms itself as such questions repressive aspects of entrenched narrative modes; it aims to trace the channels through which narrative exclusions are con- tinuous with historical, political, and social ones. Thus, despite the waning of belief in a full narrativity that characterizes the general narrative crisis, many existing discourses on women still preserve their narrative closure by denying to woman a position as speaking and writing subject. The re-evaluation of the place assigned and the place denied</page><page sequence="7">M L N 1147 women in the discourse of knowledge has been particularly illu- minating in the re-reading of the texts of psychoanalysis. In the work of Irigaray and Cixous, for instance, Freud is shown to have narrated once again, with reference to woman, the discourse of exclusion that opposes reason to madness, sense to non-sense, logos to silence, plus to minus, masculine to feminine.'6 In this narrative fiction, the initial exclusion of one term, or its devalorization as lacking, serves to ground the ultimate integrity of the fully signi- fying term to which it is opposed. For certain women writers, it is the phallic model of language, with its anatomically determined law of castration, that must be questioned.'7 The law of castration is for them a notion that ought to be turned against psychoanalysis, or returned to it accompanied by a reappraisal of the terms of exclusion on which it is based.18 Madeleine Gagnon, for instance, affirms that the real castration is the way woman is excluded from discourse, symbolization, and abstraction by the discourse that pro- poses its law. She maintains that woman can gain access to the narrative of history and claim her right as a subject of history.'9 Other writers however, such as Irigaray, Cixous, and Leclerc, question the entire system of historical representation of which psychoanalysis is only a part. They have shown the major narrative exclusions at work in the type of history whose acquiescence to a fixed structure (of origin and end, cause and effect, within a uni- fied temporality) refuses access to woman. Its forms of closure amount to a strategy of exclusion. In her work on the closures exercised by the discourse of philosophy and psychoanalysis, Luce Irigaray stresses that "Au commencement s'arre^terait son histoire, pour se laisser prescrire par celle d'un autre."20 In this narrative, wom- en's story/history cannot begin to be uttered because it cannot in fact begin; it is inchoate since woman is not granted the legitimacy to occupy the position of a full, transcendental subject, which is both this narrative's condition and origin. Faced with the discursive machine of psychoanalysis and philosophy, one can set about to undermine it, suggests Irigaray, by questioning "le fonctionnement de la 'grammaire' de chaque figure du discours, ses lois ou necessites syntaxiques, ses configurations imaginaires, ses reseaux metapho- riques, et . . . ses silences."'2' In order to re-read the discourse of mastery, Julia Kristeva as well has focused on syntax. This is be- cause it is the symbolic modality that through syntax imposes the Logos and its discourse of mastery. In her own 'historical' schema, Kristeva opposes the symbolic to the pre-oedipal relation of mother</page><page sequence="8">1148 MARIA MINICH BREWER and infant, which she calls the semiotic modality, thus denying any absolute priority to the symbolic.22 The context of these critical re-readings of the narratives of knowledge is well elaborated in Alice Jardine's study of the concept of woman in modern French theory. In her 'archaeology' of the space of the feminine, or gynesis as she calls it, Jardine characterizes gynesis as "the space 'outside of' the conscious subject [which] has always connoted the feminine in the history of western thought."23 In the narrative crisis of philosophy, history, and literature, she writes, the attempt has been made to think through "that which has been the master narratives' own 'non-knowledge.' " Beyond the unified concepts of Man, the Subject, Truth, History, and Meaning lies a space without identity and stability and yet which is always "a space coded as feminine" (p. 58). In Lacan, she writes, Man's un- conscious is "gendered as being feminine" and a succession of fem- inine spaces (such as feminine jouissance) come to designate that which escapes discourse and defines the ultimate limit of any dis- course articulated by Man (pp. 61-62). Jardine's humorous description of Lacan's dizzying metonymy of feminine spaces leads to a question crucial to understanding the implications of gynesis for women's discourse.-"Might it be," she asks, "that to posit that process-beyond the Subject, the Dialectics of Representation, and Man's Truth-as a process incarnated by women is to fall back on the very anthropomorphic (or gyno- morphic?) images that the thinkers of modernity are trying to dis- integrate?" (p. 64). Gynesis would thus be trapped within represen- tation by the figures with which it designates the other of repre- sentation. For Jardine, the problem with this view is that it contains all the makings of the traditional representation of woman. Jacques Derrida takes up another side of the question of gynesis, deconstructing it in a way that points up the extent to which La- canian psychoanalysis and metaphysics (psychoanalysis as meta- physics) depend on a feminine figure as metaphor for the truth (of the unconscious, the law of castration, the signifier). Derrida writes, "the truth value (that is, Woman as the major allegory of truth in Western discourse) and its correlative, Femininity (the essence or truth of Woman) . .. are the foundations or anchorings of Western rationality (or Phallogocentrism [as the complicity of Western metaphysics with a notion of male firstness])."24 From its versions in Romanticism to its contemporary expression as "non- knowledge" or the other of rationality, the discourse of truth still</page><page sequence="9">M L N 1149 depends on the allegorization of woman as truth. Her allegorical function is precisely the means by which she is denied a place of speaking and writing subject. In other words, allegorizing woman as the desired other of rationality, elevating (reducing) her to a metaphor for the unconscious, is no different in its effects from taking the feminine as the figure of truth. Both discursive acts enclose woman ever more securely within a tradition that ex- cludes her. The critique of gynesis is made by Lyotard as well, though for him if such a critique is to be effective, explicit reference must be made to a pragmatics of discursive acts. In addressing himself spe- cifically to metadiscourse concerning woman (the feminine), Ly- otard argues that in order to constitute itself, the discourse of the "center" needs to set up woman as and at the outer limit of its Empire.25 Lyotard's discursive 'topography' illustrates that the "feminine" margin or periphery is obsessively constructed by the dominant and constitutive discourse, "the Voice at the [or with its] virile Center" ("la Voix au Centre viril").26 Significantly, Lyotard does not aim to describe the 'feminine' or the constitutive discourse that defines it. Instead, he challenges the cognitive modes of philo- sophical inquiry by grafting them onto the discursive acts that con- stitute epistemological and political spaces. While the critique of gynesis in all its forms is invaluable for questioning woman's place in its system, it still remains a critique of what it takes to be of the past. It is far less assertive concerning the possibility of woman's discourse now and in the future. Annie Leclerc, author of essays that might be called theory-fiction, is one of the women writing in France today for whom a critique of nar- rative's incompatibility with woman's discourse goes hand in hand with such commitment to a parole de femme. For her, male-domi- nated discourse and the representation of reality are specular im- ages that are completely adequate to each other: "Le monde est la parole de l'homme. L'homme est la parole du monde. "27 The iden- tity between man and his speech, their overlapping with no margin of difference, is what is called truth. Over against the discourse of truth that reduces feminine discourse to silence, Leclerc calls for writing to "inventer une parole qui ne soit pas oppressive. Une parole qui ne couperait pas la parole mais delierait les langues" (p. 8).28 Leclerc's work is a vital communication of lyricism, philosophy, theory, cultural criticism, fiction, and autobiography. Her writing</page><page sequence="10">1150 MARIA MINICH BREWER undoes the separation of genres as she connects and reconnects these different discourses with one another. Her texts deal with the experience of childbirth, philosophy, formal gardens, men- struation, an old peasant couple, Descartes, trains, the death of the mother, adventure narrative, etc., and this is perhaps why her texts are radical in a special sense. Her writing retains its syntactical order and thematic unity. Her questioning of the laws, presup- positions, and effects of narrative does not derive from a disruptive play of the signifier-often hastily taken to characterize all French ecriture fiminine. It is the very act of bringing subjects without common measure or value into contiguity, subjects that have their assigned place elsewhere, that challenges the narrative closures in which they are ordinarily held. In Parole defemme, Leclerc proposes the adventure story, in film and novel, as a model for narrative in general. All narrative quest is founded on conquest: "Prendre, conquerir, vaincre, avoir. C'est en quoi consiste la chasse. Chasse aux tresors, chasse aux femmes, chasse a l'homme. Posseder, c'est le programme de laventure" (p. 26). The fascination and power of adventure stories derive from their hero's proximity to death. Adventure narrative has as its goal, its telos, a flight from death, which is also a move to appropriate (feminine) death: Une terre, des femmes, des hommes vaincus, c'est du pareil au meme, surout quand il s'agit d'affronter SA mort, histoire de la posseder elle aussi, cette garce rebelle, comme le reste. Et le heros tout entier s'engage en fonction du regard qu'il porte sur la mort, la sienne.... Le monde n'a pour le heros qu'une dimension metaphysique: la fu- ture dissolution de son moije, la fin des possessions. ... Et la meilleure formule par laquelle le heros definit sa quete: "Je veux laisser une cicatrice sur cette carte" [Malraux] (p. 26-27). Telling the story of the subject's future dissolution is a way to postpone such dissolution, to conquer or possess the identity and integrity of the subject. Moreover, the consolidation of possession within narrative is echoed by the murmur of what has been set outside the category of valorized objects of possession, such as the subject of woman's pleasure. Following upon her rejection of narrative as a program of pos- session, Leclerc's critique is directed at the history of the discourse of desire as told by the stories of psychoanalysis, philosophy, and</page><page sequence="11">M L N 1151 history. Her insight is to have yoked the narrative of conquest to that of desire as it is recounted in the discourses of knowledge. Desire is the complementary side or reflected image of the nar- rative of quest as conquest. "Que le desir-toison d'or, le desir-Graal, le desir-nostalgie, le desir-aventure, le desir-pas assez, le desir-trop, le desir oiseau lugubre, que le desir oiseau de mort me sorte par les oreilles . . . " (p. 120-2 1). The discourse of desire is the discourse of male desire recounting itself through the narrative of adven- ture, project, enterprise, and conquest; there is no qualitative dif- ference between psychoanalysis' discourse of castration and any other discourse of desire, epistemology or fiction, founded on lack, non-possession or the presence of an absence. Their narrative project obeys the same law. As Leclerc suggests, the philosophical concept possesses far less neutrality or universality than philosophy would claim. The con- cept too is marked sexually by its place within the economy of male desire as narrative. Sartre's projet, for instance, amuses Leclerc be- cause it disguises virile desire as philosophical austerity. The pro- jet is what allows the masculine subject to exist, that is, to be situ- ated, by projecting himself out of and before himself. As Sartre writes, "the virile being is a project of virility, which experiences no other virility than the virility of its project." For Leclerc, the tautology contained in this formulation (projet-virile desire-being) is founded on the forceful rejection of all that stands in the way of the projet and which Sartre qualifies figuratively as "moss, rot or cauliflower"-for which she substitutes "woman." In her reading, Bataille's jouissance is also bound to the same tradition of narrating desire as Sartre's projet. The discourse of desire in Ba- taille, although it bears the name jouissance, depends on a decision to equate jouissance with death for, as he writes, "le sens dernier de l'erotisme est la mort" (p. 126). She detects an exacerbation of the notion of desire in his claim that "nous annexons l'objet au desir, qui etait en verite celui de mourir, nous l'annexons 'a notre vie durable"; she adds that here virile thought reaches its limits since it cannot resolve to betray jouissance as life (p. 127). Had she pursued the discussion of Bataille, she might also have discerned in his writing a movement sharply opposed to her own. For him, the deathly silence of eroticism is the culmination of a movement from discontinuity (language) to continuity (silence), while for her the essential movement is from silence to the inven- tion of woman's speech. She would also have found in Bataille not</page><page sequence="12">1152 MARIA MINICH BREWER merely the representation of woman as an object of male desire but even the assembling, piece by piece, of what she calls the "ma- chine de guerre" for the silencing of her jouissance. For instance, in seeking to illustrate the inhuman aspect of erotic activity, the absence of the rational mind, he stages that inhuman animal state not by describing the partners or the male participant, but the female who is 'set up' as an isolated object of candid voyeuristic contemplation. Her pleasure is panoptically framed by an absent lover, the male subject of theoretical discourse, and the voyeur he invites: nous imaginons facilement la surprise de celui qui n'en aurait pas con- naissance et qui, par une machination, d6Couvrirait sans etre vu les transports amoureux d'une femme dont la distinction laurait frapp6. 1i y verrait une maladie, l'analogue de la rage des chiens. Comme si quel-que chienne enragee s'etait substitue ai la personnalite de celle qui recevait si dignement. C'est meme trop peu parler de maladie. Pour le moment, la personnalite est inorie. Sa mort pour le moment, laisse place a la chienne, qui profite du silence, de labsence de la morte. La chienne jouit-elle jouit en criant-de ce silence et de cette absence.29 Bataille's extraordinary mise en scene of feminine jouissance in fact its mise a mort. Moreover, it is inseparable from his elaboration of the model of transgression which for him necessitates posing the law, the interdit to be transgressed. As Bataille sees it, because of their passivity or "attitude feminine," women "se proposent comme des objets au desir agressif des hommes," and he adds "il n'y a pas en chaque femme une prostituee en puissance, mais la prostitution est la consequence de lattitude feminine."30 His presentation of the model of transgression, which is ostensibly about human desire in general to transcend limits, reveals another model as well, a half- erased scene of transgression where the profanation (or in his terms its equivalent, prostitution) of woman has already occurred and upon which the general model can be founded. We can now grasp the necessity for Leclerc to distinguish the virtuality of jouiss- ance from the complicity of transgression with power: c'est ce que le pouvoir a trouve de mieux pour calomnier notre puiss- ance, qu'il n'y a de jouissance que dans ce vertige de la transgression, et donc qu'elle veut, aime, exige-peut-etre meme instaure, pourquoi pas tant qu'on y est-la repression.... Lajouissance n'est pas transgres- sion de la loi, ni complice du pouvoir, elle est affirmation insolente du vivre.3 1</page><page sequence="13">M L N 1153 The "privileged stories" of desire are those in which jouissance is diverted to serve the ends of mastery and death. "Le dieu cache au culte du desir, c'est la mort" (P. de F., p. 129). Over against the discourse of desire as separation and mastery, Leclerc proposes that we speak of/from jouissance, that non-place or u-topia without legitimated existence, in which limits are abol- ished and the self is traversed by the continuity of life itself. This other discourse would work out from anonymity and not the signs of identity upon which traditional narrativity is founded. What is involved is a narrative reversal, a dispossession of individual limits, the effacing of a closed self, that is, a loss of the self whose authority depended on closure, separation, and divorce-both from others and of woman.32 When Leclerc writes that she lost all that had previously made her say 'self,' limits, temporality, and separation, what she is negating are the fundamental supports of narrative closure, the "historical-mythical narrative" (p. 19). Generally speaking, the real challenge to feminine discourse is to find another way of writing without reinscribing women's exile from and within language, writing, and narrativity. For Leclerc, to write of jouissance is to affirm virtuality as la puissance (feminine) rather than submit to power as le pouvoir (masculine); like le desir and la jouissance, virtuality and power too are marked by their feminine and masculine gender forms. If the feminine is to be thought, then its ground or native earth (terre d'origine) must be in jouissance, despite the fact that the notions of life, earth, love, and joy that it expresses are necessarily bordered by the discourse of desire and the narrative of conquest. The notion of jouissance in Leclerc remains open to a variety of meanings, none of which accounts for it or closes it off. Its sense of delight, sexual pleasure, and joy is complicated by another sense of jouissance, that of being entitled to, or enjoying rights, which reintroduces legality and leg- itimation into a term that was supposed to refer to the abolishing of the law of (as) separation. Therefore, while Leclerc's jouissance may at times appear to propose the simple pleasures of life's plen- itude and continuity, the wager of woman's discourse also entails taking position in favor of the pragmatics of women's enjoyment of rights. Leclerc's notion of jouissance bears comparison with Barthes' dis- tinction between the text of pleasure and that of bliss. For Barthes, the text of pleasure "comes from culture and does not break with it."33 As a practice of reading, pleasure is characterized by "eu-</page><page sequence="14">1154 MARIA MINICH BREWER phoria, fulfillment, comfort" (p. 19). Pleasure in this sense ci.,n- firms one's identification with cultural codes and norms, while the text of bliss (jouissance) "imposes a state of loss . . . discomforts ... unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assump- tions ... brings to a crisis his relation with language" (p. 14). In Barthes' view, textual jouissance breaks with cultural tutor-texts, and this disturbance in language creates a lack that is the "void of bliss" (p. 22), an "immense subjective loss" (p. 65). Signified value is suspended in the effort to materialize the pleasure of the text, as "value [is] shifted to the sumptuous rank of the signifier" (p. 65). Barthes' own text wavers between the temptation to capture and possess his own jouissance in the materiality of the signifier, at which point it would only be a cultural pleasure once more, and the impossiblity of arresting its open-ended drift and atopicality. The figure of speech he calls upon to account for this tension or wavering is the neuter. The neuter is designed to suspend the def- initions of culture, history, genre, in short, ideology. Yet however much the neuter is supposed to figure undecida- bility, in The Pleasure of the Text it occupies a position between what are genderized definitions of both narrative and writing. The telling of stories is "always a way of searching for one's origin, speaking one's conflicts with the Law," and hence the Death of the Father makes telling stories unnecessary and perhaps impossible (p. 147). The modern move to disinherit Oedipus amounts there- fore to dismissing narrative, which Barthes understands as a de- prival of pleasure for literature and reading. Narrative pleasure then can only be a masculine pleasure, addressing itself to the Father. In addition, Barthes claims that for the writer the object of pleasure is the mother tongue. "The writer is someone who plays with his mother's body . . . in order to glorify it, to embellish it, or in order to dismember it" (p. 37). Jouissance derived from such a "disfiguration of language," the mother tongue, comes therefore to supplant the pleasures of the patriarchal narrative. Ultimately, however, Barthes' notion of the neuter loses its neutrality precisely in the male and female figures called upon to elucidate writing and reading. In Leclerc, speaking and writing feminine jouissance cannot be understood within the limits of such a move from patriarchal nar- rative to the dismemberment of language as a maternal (material) body. Instead, woman's discourse playfully undoes the master nar- rative without any remnant of Barthes' nostalgia for the withdrawal</page><page sequence="15">M L N 1155 of its paternal addressee. Despite the fact that her discourse, like Barthes' jouissance, disturbs and unsettles established cultural and historical values as well as the constituted subject, this disturbance never derives its efficacy from being exercised upon language fig- ured as a female body. Barthes' jouissance never manages to escape the oedipal relation because it is nothing other than a re-play of its scenario. Leclerc's jouissance, on the contrary, sets itself outside this relation not only by refusing to be figured within the terms of a nostalgic loss of the patriarchal narrative, but also by negating the substitute fiction of language as a mother tongue, a fiction that remains an inseparable part of that oedipal narrative. Besides the metaphors they use to stage their pleasure, another revealing dif- ference between Leclerc and Barthes lies in the mode in which they set their critique of narrative. Leclerc's way of undoing its coercion is to satirize its pretensions playfully, while Barthes' is to make the undoing of narrative into a heroic act of self-negation, the sacrifice of comfortable identification with one's language and culture. Since for Leclerc the latter were never able to provide such a cozy space of identification in the first place, she loses nothing but the uneasiness of not being quite speakable within the languages of culture. In what she calls its "mysterious marriages of perception" ("les epousailles mysterieuses du percu" p. 36), the body's pleasure comes to include hearing, seeing, knowing, wishing, enabling, growing, loving. Emblematically, jouissance dissolves the I, the con- stituted, transcendental subject, into the materiality of whatever it traverses. Leclerc affirms the sensible and the perceptible, and relies as well on the notion of materiality to undo the idealist terms of philosophy's project of mastery. Her woman's discourse valor- izes materiality, as well as her woman's body, textual musicality and intensities, because they all have been devalorized by a metaphysics of man's truth. On a thematic level, Leclerc's texts privilege the coming into full presence of the body's pregnant speech, appearing to come very close to what since Derrida we recognize to be the space of a metaphysics of presence. Yet before concluding that such a metaphysical temptation is a constitutive and enabling blind- ness that accompanies the politics of woman's discourse in general, we might reflect on the context in which such solicitations occur. If the choice turns out to be between a metaphysics en acte as prescribed by present-day narrative exclusions and a metaphysics of vast historical dimensions, then the choice will be to give voice</page><page sequence="16">1156 MARIA MINICH BREWER to the "corps muet, ecarte, sans histoire." In Leclerc's work, some- thing of this tension emerges in her metaphors of contour, design, and enceinte, which are opposed to those of scar and trace. Ex- pressing the difficulty of speaking the body without divorcing it from the words she utters, she writes "rien ne peut effacer, quand je parle, la trace sombre, la cicatrice sensible et doublement en ce qui fut divise, cicatrice en ma langue, cicatrice en ma chair" (Ep., p. 111). Elsewhere, metaphors of trace, design, and contour are used to describe the pleasure of touching that interlaces the self and the other, "traces ensemble, d'un meme geste, nous dessinons l'un l'autre ... il n'y a qu'un dessin dans la caresse pour ta forme et la mienne" (P de F., p. 139). Leclerc's image of her pregnancy, her enceinte, articulates at once a figure of closure and expansion, contraction and dilation. Giving birth is described as a cosmic ex- perience of limits, "j'allais m'arreter la, aux limites extremes de l'enceinte que j'etais encore" (p. 80). The very possibility of speaking woman emerges from the ne- cessity for her to speak from where she is woman, from the depths of the feminine body negated by power and reduced to silence (Ep., p. 10). It is as if that silence had carved out a space to inhabit when all others were reserved for man. Speaking and writing therefore derive from that space in the hollow of the dominant discourse from which woman affirms her virtuality (puissance) and her jouissance. The themes of love, pleasure, pain, energy, life, and death all issue from an initial affirmation of life. Clearly, Leclerc's insistence on her feminine body and its capacity to give birth and to nurture life might be too easily categorized as a form of 'bio- logical feminism.' It should be remembered, however, that the 'body' of 'woman' of which she writes is a necessary fiction, an "invention," which never loses touch with its emergence in lan- guage, that is, in language as an affirmation of jouissance. "Je veux ecrire, penser de la' oui je suis, femme. Femme? je veux dire la oui je suis, non saisie par le pouvoir, preservee de son exercice, corps de jouissance et d'affirmation. C'est le lieu dont je viens et d'ou je m'appelle, femme" (Ep.,p. 120). 'Woman' is not a given but a form of invocation or address that is a process of name-giving or self- naming, as the punctuation here stresses. As woman, Leclerc writes, I will speak of or from myself, and not on or about myself. Discourse on or about woman can only fall prey to separation, ob- jectification, and hence the desire for mastery. In the face of the modern tradition with a long pre-history, in which it is language</page><page sequence="17">M L N 1157 itself that divides, separates, and establishes difference, Leclerc argues that this breach is created instead by language as it is used. By being exclusively on the side of man, language institutes a never-healing tearing or shredding in the human fabric (Ep., p. 12). Given this understanding of language, the alternative is speaking from a space that opens, permits, and affirms rather than interdicts (prohibits and silences), delimits, and rejects. The notion of jouissance is expressly fluid, yet it intersects with a linguistic and philosophical construct now familiar to Anglo- American interpreters. Although the terms of speech-act theory do not appear in her writing, Leclerc is aware of the significance that the distinction between constative and performative utterances has for a woman's discourse. In J. L. Austin's How To Do Things With Words, performative utterances are those in which "the issuing of the utterance is the performing of an action,"34 such as to au- thorize, order, question, promise, affirm, deny, etc. Since Austin later found that performative utterances could not be set up over against constative or descriptive ones, he subsumed his initial dis- tinction into the general theory of illocutionary acts or speech acts. It is on the level of the distinction between constative and perfor- mative utterances that Leclerc questions the discourse on woman. Where such language appears to be of a constative (descriptive or cognitive) nature, it in effect conceals a performative utterance that limits woman's power to perform (speech) acts. For instance, when women hear "that is the way it is," what they understand is the injunction "don't do otherwise," and when women are told they are silent, they hear the imperative "do not speak" (Ep., p. 78). Likewise, when Leclerc reads philosophy, her question is not "what is thought?"-to which the answer can only be a constative utter- ance, a statement of fact or truth-but rather "what does thought want?" (pp. 1 10-1 1). This tongue-in-cheek displacement of Freud's famous question, "what does woman want?", removes philosophy from the realm of constative discourse and plunges it into that of performative utterances and speech acts, which cannot be sepa- rated from the discursive context, the conditions of utterance, and the interlocutionary situation in which they occur. If philosophy can "want," it can also prescribe, command, and proscribe. And here is where Leclerc addresses to philosophy the inadmissible question, "What good does philosophy serve?" ("La philosophie, ca sert 'a quoi?"), to which she answers, "ca sert 'a savoir, ca sert a commander, ca sert a e'tre du cote des maitres, du cote du pouvoir"</page><page sequence="18">1158 MARIA MINICH BREWER (pp. 114-15). Thus women's discourse reads and writes the nar- rative of knowledge as a performative discourse that defines the limits of what gendered subjects may or may not perform as acts. Leclerc's texts exemplify a new rhetoric of affirmation whose critical performativity is essential to the wager of performing an ecriture feminine. Beginning with their titles, both Parole de Femme and Epousailles foreground their illocutionary necessity. In the former, Leclerc engages a semantic play on giving one's word, one's parole d'honneur, so as to subvert performative claims to uni- versality resting on a parole d'homme, which is "un tissu plein de trous, dechire, effiloche; un tissu bru'le" (p. 9). Her text's own performativity, her "utopography" as she calls it, is founded on the belief that by affirming woman's discourse one also invents new social and epistemological contracts that undo any privileged performative discourse. Leclerc, along with other women writers and theorists, offers her readers both a critique of narrative as well as new directions for overcoming the exclusions of contemporary discourses on women. In sum, these writers have consistently refused the limits of a grammar of narrative. To be productive in a feminist reading, the 'seductive analogy' between sentence and narrative cannot be treated as a transcendental and timeless condition, but rather must be taken as a cultural and ideological determination. In this way the exclusion of women's discourse that is prescribed by syntax (the symbolic) in the context of the full narrative and the Oedipal relation comes into view and may be countered by writing. Fur- thermnore, these writers have not taken the talk of a crisis in nar- rative to mean simple end of narrativity because of its waning. Instead they have continued to uncover in a variety of texts their narrative exclusions, their ideological ends. They have made ex- plicit the remarkable consistency of narrative exclusions in dis- courses that seem to have the least in common. By setting narrative possibilities into dialogue with one another, they have actively con- tributed to breaking down separations between different dis- courses of knowledge, fictions, and theories. In other words, a critique that reveals woman's place within and 'without' narrative works to undo various textual, conventional, and institutional boundaries. Such approaches to narrative in general undo limits that prevent us from recognizing the systematic nature of its in- terlocking discursive closures, that is, its ideology. Finally, such writing has brought about A significant displace-</page><page sequence="19">M L N 1159 ment of questions relating to the specificity and definition of wom- en's discourse at the present time. Are these texts, which at once participate in and create the general crisis in narrative, clearly dif- ferent from other critical discourses that they write and/or chal- lenge (such as literature, philosophy, deconstruction, and psycho- analysis)? Posed in this way, there are certainly no global answers to the question of the specificity of women's writing. Rather one can say that this writing is both inter-discursive and trans-discursive in that it brings all discourses into communication with one another by carving out a space between them. Because women's writing has a significance in its effects and affects not accounted for by any one of these critical discourses, the question itself is displaced and reinscribed. Women's discourse has little to do with an ineffable or unnameable essence of Femininity. The form of the question, 'What is woman's discourse?', or 'What is feminine writing?', is in fact complicitous with narrative closure. The question presupposes that one necessarily ought to define the various spaces, scenes, and potentialities of that discourse in the form of a description in a constative (cognitive) mode. Displace this question instead to the varied practices of performative language that characterize much women's writing today, and you realize that it is precisely such an 'enjoyment' of performativity that is being reaffirmed. These texts of women's writing thoroughly alter the way we write and interpret (and are interpreted by) the narratives of knowledge. They invent a writing that allows for the co-existence of narrative differences.
