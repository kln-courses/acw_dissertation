<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID TIIOREAU WIECK Funny Things IN THIS PAPER I shall distinguish among three fundamentally different kinds of laughter situation. By these distinctions I hope to explain the plausibility and show the limitations of traditional theories of laughter and the funny, particularly those which give central and exclusive position to concepts of play, superiority, and incon- gruity. After developing suitable principles for the three kinds, I shall apply these principles to the aesthetic comic, as it is found in dramatic comedy, with results of theoretical importance. At the end we shall possess the main outlines of a philosophical theory of laughter and the comical. By speaking of outlines I mean to warn that I shall pass over many subtleties of which I am aware but which cannot be handled in a communication of this length. The term philosophical should serve as sufficient no- tice that certain highly traditional questions will be set aside as unsolvable, while the term theory should indicate that the full import of certain distinctions will become apparent only gradually. 1. FIRST DISTINCTIONS I take as my beginning point a distinction which is not new but whose bearings are not immediately obvious. We know that some laughter has no apparent object, and we know further that laughter which does have an object may either be directed overtly at DAVID THOREAU WIECK is associate professor of philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is preparing a book on Aesthetic Inquiry and one on the Comic Muse of which this article is a part. persons or, not being so directed, may be characterized as impersonal. As a prepara- tory step I interpret this three-fold distinc- tion and make it more precise (Roman nu- merals will be used as class-names): (I) Think of two people laughing to- gether over (or about) something shared be- tween them-an experience, a game, a memory, a trick, a surprise. Certain kinds of events, such as recognitions, fooling, teasing, catching someone or being caught, catching on to something, being taken by surprise, are frequently marked by laughter. But neither this nor any other list of such events is exhaustive. This is the laughter of "fun" and "play" of which Max Eastman made much-nothing and no one is being laughed at.l Ordinary speech reflects this non-referentiality: one laughs in surprise, for joy, from delight. The case is of im- portance because it is the situation of the parent and the infant who is learning to laugh, and also of any group of close friends who relax in company, are con- tinually on the verge of laughter, are laugh- ing with their eyes and facial muscles, and laugh aloud at slight provocation without reason or object one could pinpoint. In critical discussions, laughter is fre- quently treated as a solitary behavior-a be- ginning which impels one to physiological explanation. Like Bergson, I understand laughter as social.2 One may laugh to him- self but so may a person talk to himself; we do not take private discourse as a model of speech. (By social, however, I do not mean, in this first type, interpersonal in the full sense of the term.) In laughing we express</page><page sequence="2">438 something to each other, but just what we express, just what we feel, is a highly varia- ble particular which we must not expect to define. I take it that we normally feel tickled when we laugh, and by this I under- stand an intense, pleasurable surface excite- ment. But beyond assuming a feeling-corol- lary to laughter, I have neither need nor intention of going. (II) Think now of one or more people laughing at someone. This means that there is someone who does not laugh and to whom the laughter refers. If on the same occasion that person laughs at himself, he joins those who are laughing at him; but as the object of laughter, he does not laugh. Charac- teristically there is something about the other which seems funny to the one who laughs. Sometimes the person himself is regarded as funny; perhaps oftener a spe- cific action or physical feature is so regarded or would be so affirmed. I assume that ani- mals and inanimate objects can, by a nor- mal anthropomorphism, be related to in the same way. Within (II) I distinguish further (A) and (B). The former is the model usually at- tributed to Hobbes: "I laugh at him." 3 The latter is Bergson's: "We laugh at him." This distinction clarifies why some explanation of cases discusses individual interests and sensitivities (A) while some properly makes mention of social function and collective purposes (B). (A solitary laugher may ex- press attitudes of his absent group; I shall not undertake to mention the psychological variations and combinations.) By noting a difference between (A) and (B) I do not sanction either Bergson's "machine vs. life" thesis or Hobbes's psychology.4 I understand both (IIA) and (IIB) as relations between two egos: between the laugher and the one laughed at. Those who are laughing together, however few or nu- merous, constitute (insofar as they agree) a single pole and a single ego-position. This relation is interpersonal in a sense not ap- plicable to (I). (III) Think now of one or more persons laughing at something, under circumstances involving meaning (or meaninglessness). When we laugh at a joke, it ordinarily makes no sense to say that we are laughing DAVID THOREAU WIECK at anyone; we say that we laugh at (or about) it. So also if we laugh at an absurd and unexpected turn of events. Whenever it is permissible to speak of nonsense, absurd- ity, meaninglessness, senselessness, incongru- ity, inappropriateness, then, even if the ob- ject of laughter is a person, "ego-to-ego" does not describe the case. An additional di- mension is effective, the dimension of meaning. I am not saying that we laugh because the object is absurd or incongruous; nor does "is absurd" imply "is funny." But I do contend that the meaning-predicates are relevant and cannot be omitted from a correct account of situations referred to under this heading.5 Interpretation of the three classes defined here requires care. A given case may display characteristics of more than one class. If one laughs at the answers of an ignorant student on an examination (an example analyzed by Freud), one is probably laugh- ing both at the student (II) and at his answers (III); one need not choose. If one laughs at a chair made by a bad carpenter, one may possibly be laughing at the carpen- ter (II) even though it seems considerably more natural to say that one is laughing at the chair (III). Neither observation of be- havior nor introspection suffices to decide the form of a particular case; life-situations are seldom pure cases, and any joke laughed at is a joke laughed at in some existential context of endless complexities. 2. MONAD,DYAD,AND TRIAD I now go back over the definitions given and, regarding them from a different point of view, make a distinction which I believe to be crucial. (I) is not relational. It is not relational even in the sense in which it is social (shared). In the laughter-group, whether of infancy or of adulthood, we are a group and not separate "I's"; laughing together we are one. I do not mean this merely metaphor- ically, for we are laughing in unison and what we are laughing over is internal to us, to our group, and is part of a whole which we should not dissect analytically. The con- cept of communication does not fail to ap- ply, but we have the internal communica-</page><page sequence="3">Funny Things tion of a group. The situation is one of laughter; if the word funny is appropriate (we sometimes use it), it is appropriate as a quality of the situation and not (except by an abstraction) of some fragment of it. (II) introduces a relation, is dyadic. There is one who laughs (or those who laugh) and one (more rarely a group) who is laughed at but does not laugh. Because the situation is itself split, and interpersonal in a strong sense of the term, we are justified in making a distinction between the pole of laughter and the pole of the funny or laughed at. The relation, as I have said, is ego-to-ego. (III) adds a third dimension to the dyad. There is a self who laughs and an object laughed at, but an essential fact about this situation is the presence of something in the nature of a standard or a rule of in- terpretation or a habit or disposition of mind. Let me stress the term mind. This meaning-criterion, as I shall eventually call it, is not constituted by a bare relation of selves. (III) therefore is triadic. I believe that I have now identified a difference in structure underlying the initial intuitive distinctions. Because we have in (I) an undifferentiated situation and in (II) an opposition in poles, one is tempted to ask whether (III) somehow restores the original unity in more complex form. One would not affirm such a dialectic on the scant evi- dence so far presented, and I mention it only as a possibility to which the discussion will return. Of basic importance will be the fact that analysis into monad, dyad, and triad provides within the three types a total of six different positions-for the implica- tions of "being the laugher," and also of "being laughed at," are different in (III) than in (II). This fact will prove founda- tional later on for genre-distinctions in the aesthetic-comic. 3. JUSTIFICATION OF LAUGHTE R I continue by distinguishing, following the same schema, the kinds of justification which a person can give for his laughter. By can give, I mean, of course, can give without violating the linguistic habits and canons of rationality of his group. The 439 status of the judgment "is funny" will prove interesting but my primary aim is to con- firm and clarify my distinctions. In cases conforming to (I) the person can give no rational justification for his laugh- ter-indeed, in such circumstances we are often not even aware of laughing and we are puzzled, or even annoyed, by a request for a reason. Laughter is present in us, fun- niness is present in us or with us, as fleeting and variable as our smile. To an outsider the laughter is meaningless-to have a sense of what the laughter is about one must be part of the group, and this in itself means that this laughter is not rationaliza- ble. In (II) the person who laughs is con- vinced that the other person (relevant qual- ity, behavior, personified thing) is funny- and in the teeth of James-Lange psycholo- gists he believes that he laughs because it is funny. But any justifications he gives for "funny"-"is childish," "is odd," "is pe- culiar," "is ridiculous," "is laughable"- are more like consequences of than reasons for "being funny." Since the situation is ego- structured or group-structured, people agree about what is funny (II) to the extent that they agree psychologically (IIA) or that they share cultural habits (IIB), and the grounds of agreement are subject to psychosocial investigation. One need not be part of the laughter-situation to have a sense of what the laughter is about. (III) differs in that the person who laughs is not only convinced that what he perceives is funny, he is also able to furnish inductive justification. Nonsensical, absurd, incoher- ent, illogical, meaningless, incongruous, and similar words are counted as justification for funny, although they neither imply it nor are implied by it. The basis for accord is different also, insofar as our common ra- tionality-our expectations of meaningful- ness, orderliness, consistency, sharpness of identity, confirmation of reasonable expec- tations-enters into the relevant meaning- judgment. Psychology is rather more im- portant here as explaining differences than as explaining agreement. Even so, there are obvious limits to agreement, for reasonable- ness of expectation is not subject to stand- ardization.</page><page sequence="4">440 (Remark: Until now I have for simplicity of exposition ignored certain articulations of the three fundamental situations such as might seem to affect the form of the judg- ment. I am referring to such entities as amusement parks, practical jokes, joke-mak- ing in general, clowns, and also to a variety of laughter-related attitudes. The amuse- ment park and the two kinds of jokes I characterize as institutions, and I relate the amusement part to the monad, the practi- cal joke to the dyad, and non-practical joke- making to the triad. I interpret The Clown as a symbol of The One Who Is Laughed At in (II). Such institutions and symbols, and the expression of such attitudes as a derisive attitude, a comical attitude, or a humorous attitude, enter importantly into the study of cases and the explanation of cultural phe- nomena, and they are suggestive of the complexities to be encountered in empirical studies. But I do not see that they affect the form of judgment. Some confusion results from the fact that not all jokes, clowns, and "comics" (entertainers) are in fact funny. But they are meant to be (or mean to be) funny, and if they are funny they come within the scope of the initial analysis. A successful clown (defined in the relevant sense) is ipso facto funny, but the achieve- ment of this (iconic) symbolism requires artfulness.6) 4. IMPLICATIONS OF THE DYADIC RELATION Before proceeding to the aesthetic problems, I want to investigate the dyadic and triadic situations in greater depth. Various theories present what purport to be at least necessary conditions for laughter and finding-funny. If the present analysis is sound, it should throw light on those claims and produce consequences of its own. If we consider first the dyad, we see that unlike the monad it creates the possibility of a comparison, a perception of or belief in a difference between perceiver and per- ceived. Perception of a defect or an inferi- ority has been remarked upon frequently in the history of discussion of the funny, the comical, and the ludicrous: so, for example, Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Bergson, Freud.7 DAVID THOREAU WIECK The other person stammers, is crippled, gives ridiculous answers, is clumsy, wears strange clothing, or uses strange words: these are classical. Many people disapprove of laughter at such things (so did Hobbes), but I am not trying to decide what people ought to laugh at and find funny. Such perception as funny (II) seems to suggest a comparison between oneself and the other. It seems to imply that the other is, as the theorists mentioned have claimed, defective, inferior, worthy of rejection and disap- proval. We are not content with seems. Can we be sure? That we make a comparison between our- selves and "the other" is a psychological thesis difficult to substantiate. If we do make it, we are seldom aware of it. That we laugh because of enjoyment of superior- ity-feelings is an even more doubtful psycho- logical thesis. I would argue, furthermore, that it is improper to talk at all about psy- chic causes when the psyches are those of conscious constantly adaptive organisms en- gaged in continual re-evaluations of their environment. But I believe that we do in fact know what is implied by laughter (II) and that the question would not even be in doubt if it were not confused by claims about psychic causes which we of course cannot know. An outsider to the monadic situation (I) has no way to grasp it. At best he can say something like "They must be having a good time." But the dyadic situation has a structure into which we can project our- selves, and we have had to learn to interpret the fact of being laughed at ever since we were quite small children. Whether a given case should be interpreted as "ego-to-ego," "one person laughing at another," is of course often subject to reasonable doubt and to the confusion caused by the fact that some people understand all laughter, whatever its context, as directed at them. Despite this, we all know what it means to be laughed at, if it is the case that we are laughed at. It implies inferiority, it implies some defect, it implies an attitude of nega- tivity and rejection, it implies dissociation of the laugher from the one laughed at, it implies unlikeness and difference. The one who laughs may not mean (intend) to con-</page><page sequence="5">Funny Things vey these implications but he is legitimately held responsible for them. Just as the theory of playful laughter (laughter in fun) provides a general descrip- tion of the monadic case, the dyadic case is accurately reflected by superiority theories, if they are interpreted as meaning-theories rather than causal theories. 5. ANALYSIS OF A TRIADIC SITUATION To point up the difference between the triadic and dyadic situations I shall take the detour of an illustration of the former. In his Critique of Judgment, the venera- ble Kant tells us of his ruminations on jokes.8 One can imagine that the old episte- mologist, who had spent a lifetime in search for the categories of the Understanding and the purposiveness of Nature, would have found here something to wonder at. From the standpoint of meaning, these jokes which he enjoyed were nothing, they were absurd. He could not believe that the Understanding would enjoy its own baffle- ment, so Kant supposed that our pleasure must be somatic, from the act of laughing, and only indirectly pleasing to the mind, as hygienic. Here is an apparently sensible anecdote to which we are attending with the customary expectations of sense-but at a certain moment the jaws of the Understand- ing snap shut on the thin air of absurdity, and our unloosed organs, working like bellows, produce the customary noises. Kant has been criticized, not to say ridi- culed, for his physiology, but as theories of the physiology of laughter go, his is not conspicuously bizarre. He is criticized also for failing to notice that some jokes have a point (truths in jest, witty jokes, etc.). These critics must not have read Kant's jokes, which would have exasperated anyone's Understanding.9 Yet Kant and his friends enjoyed these jokes, found them funny, and laughed at them, and these are the facts in want of explanation. I do not pretend to give a true explana- tion of "why Kant laughed." But I can make up a likely story to show what is wrong with his theory and, also, what is characteristic of the triadic case.10 441 I imagine that the social activity of re- counting these anecdotes must have been enjoyable for Kant. For a serious-minded epistemologist especially, they would consti- tute a pleasant recreation from seriousness. I can hardly believe, however, that in such a social setting, where everyone was telling jokes, Kant was really fooled. He knew that a joke was coming but he played the game (as we all do), he listened uncritically for the sake of being caught and for the sake of catching on.l1 The psychological connota- tions of "disappointed expectation," Kant's key notion, are surely misleading. If we are straining after something, it is after that connection, however flimsy, which makes the joke a joke-a piece of foolishness, as we expected, but our laughter announces that we have found it. I see the excitement of a game and pleasure in recognition. Because it is with the ear of the child, accommodating to arbi- trary connections, rather than with the ear of the Meaning-Finding, Gestalt-Making adult, that we get the point, the pleasure is more intense and closer to the level of feel- ing. But I say something more (remember that this is only a likely story). I say that for Kant the way of laughter and the way of "seeing it as a good joke" was a way of de- riving enjoyment from (precisely and above all) an irreducible absurdity: taking it for what it was, not quarreling with it or setting the Categories upon it, letting it blaze forth there for a brief moment as the friends unite in the raucous music of postprandial laughter. 6. THE THIRD ELEMENT IN THE TRIAD If we are tempted, in respect to a dyadic case, to regard our laughter as a straightfor- ward expression of a judgment of the object, the triadic case as illustrated exhibits the complications one would expect of a triad. I have pictured Kant as taking a position toward the absurdity of the object. Thereby I deny a causal relation. But there is a second error to be avoided, and that is the error of supposing a temporal sequence of (a) existence of a problem: discovery of an absurdity, followed by (b) solution of the</page><page sequence="6">442 problem: a position to take toward the ab- surdity. I think we have every reason to be- lieve that the finding "is absurdly funny" is in fact unitary, and of one piece with the vocal and physiognomic expression. The reader should bear this in mind as I now try to make clearer what I understand by meaning-criterion. I take it to be the constant business of the human mind to perceive systematic con- nections, spatial, temporal, and causal, in its perceptual field. (I shall talk of percepts; but funny ideas and thoughts can be dis- cussed analogously.) We assign identities to individual things, we regard them as in- stances of ideas or members of classes. We strive to resolve ambiguities. We apply the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Very well: I am not going to name a set of Categories. The point is that in assimilating the more or less continual novelty which is our per- ceptual world, we encounter things which, relative to our momentary or persisting dis- position, do not fit. We expect causes to seem rightly proportioned to effects; we ex- pect animals to look like we think animals look; we expect women to dress as women and men to dress as men. (The sense of ex- pect here is logical.) Irrational as well as ra- tional factors are relevant here, for we re- spond with anxiety to the appearance of that which (in Freud's terms, which I shall not try to improve on) we have condemned to repression. To be genuinely bothered by such mat- ters is, I suppose, the sign of a grossly una- daptive mind. Generally, if we have no pressing commitment, or are in a mood for amusement, or are bent on seeing "the comical side of things," we take them as trifling and funny absurdities. (We may not laugh-we may express a milder amuse- ment with appropriate moderation.) We enjoy the fabrication and communication of such curiosities. If we were to try to say what tickles us, we should have to talk about the particular content of the situation or the joke or whatever, and I would be minded to listen to suggestions that we en- joy returning to the arbitrary world of childhood before we give in to the Reality Principle.12 But if we set aside questions of psychology, or content, and questions about DAVID THOREAU WIECK why we laugh and find the object funny, what is left is the fact that there is a defect or wrongness in the form of what we per- ceive. This defect is meaning-linked in the sense I have exposited it here. I do not mind using the term incongruity as a generic term for the triad. But let two reservations be observed strictly: Let us not say that we laugh "because incongruity is comical," for we may or may not elect, by habit or spontaneous choice, to link the independent ideas of funniness and incon- gruity. And let us remember that this in- congruity is relative to our mental assimila- tion-disposition (the third element in the triad) and has no further claim to objec- tivity. With these limitations I regard incon- gruity theories as essentially descriptive of type (III).13 With respect to both (II) and (III) the term defect has turned up in a statement of a necessary condition. The selection of terms is in part arbitrary, and at this point I merely call attention to a possible link. The chief significance of the meaning- criterion can now be brought out: namely, the way in which it qualifies the attitude of the laughter and the meaning of his laugh- ter. In (II), just by reason of the position of our ego, our attitude toward the laughed-at object is negative, rejecting, disapproving, inferiority-implying. Depending, I suppose, chiefly on our own sense of security and power, our laughter is more or less mocking, jeering, and contemptuous, more or less benign and tolerant, but our fundamental position is the same. In (III), however, our ego is not definitively involved. It would be too much by far to say that in (III) we are disinterested: we are hardly that when we relish a witty thrust at someone we dislike. But this involvement is related to content rather than to form. The entrance of a meaning-dimension allows a balancing: very often our sympathies seem to divide be- tween the absurd object and the standards by which it is absurd. As I have suggested about Kant, our perception as funny (III) often includes a moment of acceptance and enjoyment, even of appreciation, and the frequent and appropriate term is ambival- ence. Negativity, rejection, disapprobation are qualified by the distance at which the</page><page sequence="7">Funny Things ego stands in feeling from the ground of meaning-evaluation. 7. GENERALIZATION OF THE ANALYSIS I have been careful to work inductively, that is, from properties of the domain of the funny rather than from broad epistemologi- cal, axiological, or metaphysical concep- tions. My selection of terms has, on the whole, been designed to avoid obvious ties to such broader concepts. (This has been as true of my investigations as of my exposition here, after allowance is made for unavoida- ble philosophical bias.) But now, prior to extrapolating to the aesthetic, there will be no harm in noting briefly certain of these connections. I understand the distinction among mo- nad, dyad, and triad as corresponding to a distinction among feeling, will, and intel- lect. By intellect, I understand the activity of ordering particulars by means of a cate- goreal and conceptual framework; relative to the domain of the funny, it yields judg- ments of "ought to be-ought not to be." By will, I understand "ego-sense," "self- sense," namely the habits of conceiving of oneself as a self in relations with other selves; relative to the domain of the funny, the will yields judgments of "is like me- is different than me." The judgments on the level of feeling, the biological level, are of the order "is fun-is not fun." I understand the categories and concepts of the intellect as arising through objectification of the habits of will under the control of culture, and then proceeding to autonomous elabor- ation. I understand the will as arising through an effort to exert control over the pleasure-pain economy, which is primary in the life of feeling. Feeling is of course present at all three levels, just as self is pres- ent at the third level. A consequence of the above considera- tions is that greater precision can now be given to the concept of defect or form-defect. In (II) the funny "other" is defective by the implicit standard of the self; in (III) the funny person or thing is defective in respect to what it ought to be (not primarily morally). If someone argues that "ought" 443 is implicit in "the will" as understood here, my answer is that there is a stage in develop- ment, and also a type of thinking and be- havior not confined to children, for which this is not so. In practice, I readily concede, one is likely to encounter degrees of ego- involvement (II) and ego-disinvolvement (III) rather than a clean dichotomy. 8. AESTHETIC ARTICULATIONS Having completed my survey of the three basic classes, I am ready finally to consider the aesthetic comic. I intend to show that the definitions of (I), (II), and (III) can be viewed as generating different varieties of comedy and comic art, and that through my interpretation of the non-aesthetic funny we are able to understand important charac- teristics of aesthetic experience of the comi- cal. Such well-known theories of laughter and the comic as Hobbes's, Kant's, Schopen- hauer's, Freud's, and Eastman's deal negligi- bly or not at all with comic art and comic- aesthetic experiences; German aesthetics in the nineteenth century, stimulated by Hegel, took great interest in The Comic but chiefly in the spirit of deductive meta- physics. The six different positions which com- prise the structure of the monad, dyad, and triad correspond, I shall try to show, to six significantly different genres. The term genre has neo-classicist connotations; my moderate sense of it will become apparent. For examples I shall limit myself to the dramatic arts; a further test of the theory would be its adequacy for the literary and plastic arts (except for the mixed case of opera, music incorporates comic elements without focusing upon them exclusively). The aesthetic form corresponding to the monadic case is the Farce, or Situation Comedy, or any form of comedy whose simple and immediate aim is amusement, enjoyment, without the complications and ambitions of the other levels. We may let the Marx Brothers' films stand as a nearly pure specimen. More recently the Beatle film, A Hard Day's Night, fits nicely into the same genre; the predominant feelings evoked are of freedom and play. Incessant motion, pointless by adult or rational stand-</page><page sequence="8">444 ards, is generally characteristic of this genre, and for this reason, it may be, the genre achieves a fulfillment in the motion picture not easily achieved on the stage. Later I shall give reasons for allowing this rather disreputable form of comedy into the aes- thetic domain. On the dyadic level, arising from the po- sition of The One Who Laughs (let us call this position II-1), we have Satire as a comedic form. Satire allows for elaboration through Wit on the (III) level but it is not dependent on Wit. The satiric weight may be heavier or lighter; regarding the Swiftian manner as extreme, I offer Moliere's plays as exemplars; Comedy of Character is also an accepted term. I am encouraged in this judgment by the fact that Bergson, for whom Comedy was Moli&amp;re, took the re- jecting attitude of (II) as basic to the comic. Since the utility of certain comic possibili- ties depends on the cultural context in which an artist works, it would not be sur- prising (nor would it affect my thesis) if relatively pure specimens of (II-1) are rare nowadays.l4 If we look at the other pole of the dyad, at The One Who Is Laughed At (11-2), we find a remarkable phenomenon: the artistic development of the figure of the Clown, symbol of this position. This is where I lo- cate the Chaplin films of pre-Verdoux vin- tage. (In a different medium, Marcel Mar- ceau achieves something closely analogous.) What Chaplin did was to enter into the comic figure, The One Who Is Laughed At, to view him with affection and compassion, and to build an art around him. The effect is of course one of pathos rather than of satire; one is not looking at the comic figure scornfully from the outside, one is looking at him from within, feeling what it means to be in his position; the Clown is viewed as human being, the symbol becomes real. On the triadic level, distinctions are more difficult because elements from other levels are common, as are amalgamations of tri- adic possibilities. It is easiest to identify, in the position of what I have called the mean- ing-criterion, which I also think of as mind as distinct from ego, the Comedy of Wit, the comedy of Wilde and (frequently) Shaw. (Let us call this position III-2, because of DAVID THOREAU WIECK its mediating character.) In the position of The One Who Laughs (III-1), a good ex- ample is Twelfth Night which, although not lacking in farcical and satiric elements, aims higher, is not unkindly, shows affection and amusement, is good-humored, is without bitterness, and, appropriately, is poetic. In illustration of the final position, That Which Is Laughed At (1I-3), what is wanted is examples of aesthetic articulation of the absurd, comically; the extraction of meaning from that which is defective is meaning. Here I cite Waiting for Godot and Albee's Zoo Story; the theater of the absurd, so far as it turns the absurd to comic account, would appear to be on the whole an artistic institution corresponding to (III-3). (III-2) tends to display the articulation of new comic possibilities through the creation of new standards (by contrast, II-1 tends to be conventional and conservative). (III-1) is characterized by the resolution, in humor- ous but non-vindictive laughter, of the am- bivalence that the triad generates. (III-3) tends to accept absurdity as the rule of existence. That I am proposing hereby no genre exclusiveness I can make clear, if it is not clear already, by the example of Aristophanes, whom I regard as a satirist of character and manners who took a humor- ous view of things, was sharply witty, ex- plored the absurd for its own sake, and was all the time amusing himself and his audience. The only position he did not ex- ploit was the pathos of the Clown; but this art, appropriately an art of mime, would be awkward for such a witty writer. Something similar could be said of Chekhov. On the other hand, I would be inclined to treat Ionesco primarily through (III-2) and (III- 3). An important subsidiary conclusion will be that within comedy there can be no artis- tic sin of mixing the genres (except in- eptly).l5 Such a generation of artistic forms is bound to come under suspicion of inge- nuity. On the other hand, such derivation is what gives value and in a sense confirmation to the initial definitions. As personal testi- mony I may say that the differences among the forms or styles discussed above are clearer to me in consequence of this deduc-</page><page sequence="9">Funny Things tion. In the Marx Brothers, Moliere, Chap- lin, Shakespeare, Wilde, Beckett, I believe that distinct artistic points of view, differ- ent human standpoints, are represented. I have also accounted for the positions in comedy, and I hope in comic art more gen- erally, which need to be accounted for. Special position is sometimes given to such forms as parody or burlesque, but I see these as primarily referring to differences in technical means. 9. THE POSITION OF THE AESTHETIC SPECTATOR To understand the aesthetics of the comic, the position of the spectator of the play (or other aesthetic object) must be grasped cor- rectly. One might suppose that we would now have a new dyad or triad or even tetrad, in which the spectator would be in the position of The One Who Laughs and the play would be in the position of The One Who (or That Which) Is Laughed At. But this would be ridiculous, for there is nothing wrong with the play. If it is a good comedy, it is a complete and fine aesthetic object. As I understand the situation, if the play is successful we should not speak of the spectator, except as consciousness, as being in relation to the play. He is not outside the play, he enters into it. By "entering into the play" I am not re- ferring to identification with characters or to feelings of empathy. That which the spec- tator achieves identity with is the spirit and attitude and mode of feeling of the play. I suppose that I cannot prove to a skeptic that a play has a spirit and attitude and style in the strong sense required here. I am basing myself squarely on the distinc- tions of the preceding section, and by "dif- ference in spirit" I mean (for example) the difference between a Moliere play and a Chaplin film. Our emotions are different because the worlds created in the two cases imply two different creative spirits. In the simple case of Farce, the play itself is the essence, or objectification, or aesthetic reali- zation, of laughter; we laugh with its laugh- ter. (This language may be objectionably metaphorical but I find it difficult to treat the aesthetic situation more matter-of-factly. 445 Let the reader think back to my description of the monadic case; one evokes the struc- tureless, one does not describe it, and an aesthetic experience is an experience of unity.) In the case of Satire, we laugh with the author (we think of it this way) and we share his attitude of ridicule. The corol- laries for the other positions are perhaps obvious. From the position of the aesthetic-comic spectator, it follows that his ego is under no suspicion of involvement. He is disinter- ested in the sense required by Kant of the beholder of the beautiful. He has gone be- yond the wholesale self-commitment of (II) and the ambivalence of (III). Another im- portant consequence concerns the nature of the aesthetic judgment. If we ask what is the basis of our affirmation of aesthetic suc- cess in the comic case, I believe that the spectator makes this judgment, when it is well-founded, through recognition of his ability to remain within the framework (form, spirit) of the object, and his freedom from impulse or necessity to adopt a posi- tion outside it and toward it. This is an intuitive judgment of validity, closely re- lated to Kant's description of accord be- tween the Understanding and the Intuition in the case of Beauty (but Kant did not un- derstand the aesthetic possibilities of com- edy, with which he may have had even less acquaintance than with music). We signal- ize our "withinness" by laughing "with it" (vocally or in subvocal tendency) and thereby affirming its virtue. Unfortunately, no more than the subjective feelings sup- porting the judgment "is beautiful," is this laughter psychologically distinctive. The laugh sounds the same as when there is laughter in the schoolyard or at some funny event; empirically, "laughing within the play" is undistinguishable from "laughing because some jokes have been told on the stage." If we cannot tell the difference (not all of us can), our judgment is without basis. 10. THE AESTHETIC COMIC I turn back now to my earlier findings that defectiveness, or more generally defec- tiveness of form, or at any rate something</page><page sequence="10">446 which invites such characterization, is a necessary condition for "seeming funny" in (II) and (III), and I ask whether something like this holds for the aesthetic comic. Now, of the six aesthetic positions five are derived from (II) and (III) and will pre- serve their characteristics, subject to pre- vious qualification. On the face of it the aesthetic articulation of (I) is more proble- matical. It would solve some problems to deduce from its play-and-amusement orien- tation that it is pseudo-art, and there would be support in the tradition of aesthetics for doing so.16 But if it is the case, as I have already proposed, that (I) is the foundation for the presentation of the essence (phe- nomenologically) of funniness and play, and if (as would follow) the form of the work is adequate to this presentation, then I would not care to call the object non- aesthetic. In the discussion which led to attribution of "defectiveness in form" I ignored (I) be- cause a plain direct inspection of it seemed to yield no clues. But suppose one now asks the question whether something similar to "form-defectiveness" would be true of the spirit of the Marx Brothers. The term I think of is form-free. In Freud's language, whether metaphorical or not I am unsure, one would speak of rejection of the Reality Principle, affirmation of the Pleasure Prin- ciple. (For Freud, and the testimony is im- portant, "the child" in varying guises is always at the heart of the comic.) If one is to establish a link between form-defective and form-free, that link might be the con- trast between relative and absolute freedom (from form). Since absolute freedom from form can enter into art only symbolically, one would have to be careful to characterize the Farce as a presentation of a symbol of formlessness and freedom. Having come so far, I will not shrink from the steps which beckon. Is not what I described originally in (I) the absolute free- dom of the child (and in "relapse" of our- selves) from the tyranny of reality and form? Is it not a sign of the dominion of pleasure? What the child enjoys above all, given the necessary security, is the moment of novelty, surprise, topsy-turvyness-a kaleidoscope of action, only so it be vital action. Therefore DAVID THOREAU WIECK I like what Susanne Langer, who says much of value about comedy in Feeling and Form, says: that laughter is the result of "a surge of vital feeling," is "the crest of a wave of felt vitality." 17 But it is a part of matura- tion to adopt and identify with the reality- principle, to achieve a certain conformity and order, and to demand it intolerantly of others. This identification is reflected in (II) when whatever is different from one- self is inferior and is perceived as childish and babyish, and one applies to it the ridi- cule which (usually more moderately) the parents employ to discipline the childish in oneself. Then, when we have won this bat- tle, and we grow up a little (for I agree that it is an immature person who continues to laugh at cripples and foreigners and clumsy people), we begin to wish that we had not been quite so thorough in vanquishing the pleasure principle in ourselves; and this I see reflected in the ambivalence of (III) and our institutionalized pursuits of the trifling absurd for the sake of pleasure in it. But the aesthetic comic is at another level than that of laughter at the funny. Like the aesthetic in general, it represents the use of materials of everyday life to create or re- create values. For a few hours we enjoy an exhilarating freedom from an existence whose unworthiness of being taken seri- ously, whose worthiness of laughter, the work of art exhibits to us. Northrop Frye notes correctly that com- edy as a stable dramatic form has tended to present the comical liquidation of the ob- stacles to happiness.18 A "new society" is formed around the silly young people who at last grow up, and the obstructive and heretofore ludicrous older generation is reconciled. Freud thought the aim of the comic to be (as he expressed it feelingfully at the end of his study) the return to an infan- tile euphoria.19 For comedy, which Freud never really discusses, this will not do. In the final scene we do achieve, all of us, players and spectators, a situation in which we are one, and there is laughter and joy among us; life as such, indomitable, is af- firmed; all comedy is a means to this. But I would hesitate to say that we are again as children. That kind of unconditioned free- dom could not be a life for grown men and</page><page sequence="11">Funny Things women. Our freedom can only be relative, but now it is (through the artist, with whom we are united in spirit) in the mode of creativity, and that is a human triumph. lIn The Sense of Humor (New York, 1921) and more popularly in Enjoyment of Laughter (New York, 1936). 2 See Le Rire (1900), Chap. 1. 'Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651), Chap. 6. "Sudden Glory, is the passion which maketh those grimaces called laughter; and is caused either by some sudden act of their own, that pleaseth them; or by the apprehension of some deformed thing in another, by comparison whereof they suddenly ap- plaud themselves." The second of Hobbes's alterna- tives is the one usually cited in support of superi- ority and degradation theories of laughter. Hobbes's thesis is of course psycho-causal and therefore lies mainly outside my sphere of inquiry; if the "self" in "self-esteem" is not interpreted sharply individ- ualistically, there is no conflict between Hobbes's statements and the theory I am developing. 4 Bergson, Chap. 2. "Any arrangement of acts and events is comic which gives us, in a single combi- nation, the illusion of life and the distinct impres- sion of a mechanical arrangement." 5 Type (III) is the type which supports incon- gruity theories and the parallel psychological the- ories of disappointed expectation. I shall comment later on both. 6 These articulations are to be distinguished from the aesthetic-comic articulations to be discussed later. A successful clown is ipso facto funny but not ipso facto an object of aesthetic interest. 7Plato, Philebus, 48-50; Aristotle, Poetica, 1449; Hobbes; Sigmund Freud, Der Witz und seine Bezie- hung zum Unbewussten (1905), Chap. 7, "Der Witz und die Arten des Komischen"; Bergson, Chap. 2. 8In his "Remark" at the end of the Analytic of the Sublime; Section 54 of the Critique. "Suppose this story to be told: An Indian at the table of an Englishman in Surat, when he saw a bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned into froth and overflowing, testified his great astonish- ment with many exclamations. When the English- man asked him, 'What is there in this to astonish you so much?' he answered, 'I am not at all aston- 447 ished that it should flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.' At this story we laugh, and it gives us hearty pleasure...." Ibid. 10 To be precise, I am dealing here with what I have already characterized as an institution of the triad, namely joke-making and joke-telling. "1The reader may remember that "catching and being caught" was mentioned under "First Dis- tinctions" as a familiar occasion for non-objective (monadic) laugh-enjoyment. This was not an error. Not only is any particular case likely to be complex, but I believe that it is in the nature of the triadic situation to allow an affirming unity. See below, "The Third Element in the Triad." "This reference to Freud is, strictly speaking, anachronistic, since his work on wit and the comic antedates by fifteen years his development of the Reality Principle concept. But I would anticipate no difficulties in justifying the application of the principle. 13 The genealogy of incongruity theories is usually traced from Kant through Schopenhauer and Her- bert Spencer. Variants are numerous. Marie Swa- bey's Comic Laughter (New Haven, 1961) and, in the main, D. H. Monro's Argument of Laughter (Mel- bourne, 1951) fall into this class. 14 For acute observations on the historical devel- opment of comedy as an artistic form, see Wylie Sypher's essay, The Meanings of Comedy, included as an appendix to George Meredith's An Essay on Comedy, and Bergson's Laughter, in Comedy (New York, 1956). Among examples mentioned by Sypher, Machiavelli and Ben Jonson would seem to fit clearly into (II-1). Sypher's own stress is upon the recent prevalence of the tragi-comic absurd. 15"Tragic overtones," quite evidently out of place on the (I) or (II) levels unless we understand pathos as a species of tragedy, enter quite naturally into (III), especially (III-1) and (III-3). 1" From Croce and Collingwood in particular. The former saw comedy as tending to "the practical" rather than "the aesthetic", the latter as "entertain- ment" rather than "art proper." 17 (New York, 1953), p. 340. 8 Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, 1957). 19 Freud, "For the euphoria which we are thus striving to obtain is nothing but the state of a bygone time, in which we were wont to defray our psychic work with slight expenditure. It is the state of our childhood in which we did not know the comic, were incapable of wit, and did not need humor to make us happy."</page></plain_text>
