<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO VIEWS OF CUPID By Lawrence O. Scher Queens College, Flushing, N. Y. Apollonius created an of episode Rhodes and which Vergil centers each created an episode which centers around the character of Eros-Cupid. In the Argonautica (3.6-298), however, it is Eros' boyishness which stands pre- eminent, whereas in the Aeneid (1.657- 722) it is Cupid's godhead. Both writers make use of the same characters as well as similar story lines which come to one and the same conclusion. It is the literary means they use which provides an interesting comparison. Vergil conceives of the gods as su- preme mental beings. No-time is lost in meditation, no hesitation is evident as Venus spins crafty plans in her mind. In the opening six lines of the episode her scheme is formulated and polished, as befits a Vergilian goddess. The personality of Apollonius' gods is completely different. Hera and Athena open the Argonautica episode with indecisive banter. Neither has a good idea; each in turn is unwilling - or unable - to offer a suitable sug- gestion. The immediate resolution to this dilemma finds both goddesses with eyes fixed upon the ground, brooding apart. Even the dialogue is all too hu- man. It is as if Apollonius were pre- senting two countrywomen trying to decide what to make for dinner and not allowing them to reach an appropriate decision. He refuses to put the gods on a pedestal or make them of another world. Rather, the level of his godheads is human, and the interplay as if among mortal men. This anthropomorphism is vividly reflected in the portrayal of the god Eros. The first clue to Eros' personality is an under-the-breath remark made by Hera to Athena: . . and urge her to bid her son, if only he will obey" (3.26). The god is a brat, the familiar child whom we all, at- one time or another, would happily strangle if given the chance. This first impression is given im- mediate support: for twenty lines Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite argue among themselves over which of them will be burdened with the exasperating, even terrifying, chore of asking a favor of Eros. It seems the stubborn boy is not above making ominous threats to anyone with whom he disagrees. But at last Aphrodite accepts the task and goes off to speak with her son. Eros has been cheating at dice and the goddess scolds him ruthlessly, but then the tone changes abruptly, for Aphrodite has been warned by Hera not to use force of any kind. Therefore it is with a bribe - the promise of a new toy - that she entices him before she dares to make her request. To ask a favor outright would be unthinkable; first the promise, later the request. The little boy throws a tantrum, hurling his game to the ground and clinging to his mother's robes in hopes of obtaining the bribe first and paying later. But for once his pleading is all in vain. His mother has won. There is little in the Vergilian text which would lend itself to the develop- ment of a comparable character study of Cupid. The reader is told almost nothing about the god; everything is left to the imagination. Venus approaches her son and makes her request; willingly, joyfully, he obeys. There is no conversation, no argument between the two; in fact, Cupid makes no reply whatsoever. But this is only in keeping with the total scheme of the Aeneid. Vergil takes great pains not to develop the dozens of minor characters who make important, but brief, ap- pearances in the Aeneid. The person- alities of many and sundry characters would only serve to clutter the massive work. Vergil's task was to keep these supporting roles within the framework of the Aeneas story. Allecto in Aeneid 1 offers a good comparison to the Cupid of Book 1. Just as Vergil does not allow Cupid to speak, so too does he keep Allecto mute throughout. Both Cupid and Allecto are necessary to his plot and so are in- cluded, but they are not actual "members" of the Aeneid, appearing only in the role of "guests." The reader is told nothing about the personalities of either Cupid or Allecto and therefore has nothing to cling to. The person- alities of the two are nebulous; only their functions are clear. Once they have served their purposes and played out their part in their respective vignettes they are gone. There is no room for an Apollonian rogue god in the Aeneid ; there is no room for the omi- nous threat of an unrestrained and independent Allecto. All the charac- ters must somehow be controlled so as not to detract from the real story, that of Aeneas and the founding of Rome. The narrative situation in the Ae- neid is a serious one - if Dido is able to ensnare, and thus control, Aeneas in her passionate web, then Rome will never be founded - and so the exe- cution of this sequence must likewise be forceful and serious. Unlike the comic hesitation of Hera and Athena in the Argonautica, Venus' plan is godlike in its efficiency: it is conceived and polished in four lines. Venus knows that the wily Cupid is a boy in form alone; thus she will have him take ad- vantage of his physical appearance and exchange places with Ascanius. In this way he can literally fall into the em- braces of Queen Dido and thereby en- rapture her with his power. Apollonius presents an invisible, arrow-shooting Eros; Vergil's Cupid is a visible god who insinuates his power sans weapon. For Vergil the gods are not primitive forces, but refined and so- phisticated powers who work their way with mortals and find enjoyment in the process. The John Ford-like di- rection of the shoulder-shooting Eros in Apollonius has been adapted into a Noel Coward (Carthaginian) drawing- room of the highest sophistication. As- canius must be stolen away and drugged to sleep, and the restless audi- ence is meant to ponder whether he may not escape the spell and appear at the cHmax to foil the plot. Cupid-Ascanius flaunts himself in the most reckless fashion on Dido's lap. Will the queen - or, for that matter, Aeneas - realize that this is not the real Ascanius? And the power of the god himself is not an overt application. Cupid is love, and therefore his mere presence ac- complishes the end. Throughout this entire scene it is not Cupid the boy who is present, but Cupid the crafty god. It is not only her son whom Venus addresses, but also her fellow-god ("et supplex tua numi- na poseo," 1.666). Likewise, later on, the reader is again reminded of Cupid's godhead: "inscia Dido / insidat quan- tus miserae deus" (1.718-719). Further, Venus' explanation of her artful plan is adult, unfettered by the promises and bribes that Apollonius invents. The facts are stated bluntly; the mission is spelled out in clear, concise terms. Cupid obeys without comment, im- mediately executing the plan. In Apollonius the Eros episode is purposely spread out and extended as far as possible. There is no attempt at compactness. An invocation is followed by a lengthy discussion between Hera and Athena. Their joint appeal to Aphrodite stretches 110 lines, and then Aphrodite and Eros take up another 60 lines. There is a break in the action while the heroes are again the subject of the narrative, and Eros must wait another 100 lines before he is</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL OUTLOOK Page 79 allowed to perform his appointed task. The entire sequence encompasses fully one fifth of Book 3. It is clear that Vergil admired this scene but knew at the same time that it would be set off to best advantage if it appeared in his own poem as a vignette; were it as long and drawn out as the original, beauty and charm would be lost, and the sequence would become overpowering. Thus what had occupied nearly 300 lines in the Argonautica is reduced to 67 in the Aeneid. But the im- provement is due no more to the re- duction of the text than to the diligent care given to the meter, for it is the combination of these two that produces the closely knit dramatic effect. The first six lines demonstrate the tightly woven quality of the Vergilian meter. Metrically as well as logically these lines stand as a unit, emphasized by the use of the caesura. Although individual lines also contain the favored penthemimeral caesura, in none of these lines is this the main, emphatic caesura. Rather, the train of thought breaks before or after the second metrical foot: in line 657 after 3V2 feet, in 658 after Vk, in 659 after 3V2, in 660 after IV2, and in 661 after IV2; in 662 there are several powerful cae- surae. Thus the text is both bound to- gether and given marked regularity J3 y the presence - subdued though it may be - of the penthemimeral caesura and at the same time given variety by the other caesurae. The first complete stop is at line 662, and even this end-stopped line is cleverly handled. The opening four lines of the episode each contain dactyl couplets which give the narrative a brisk pace: 657 - ddsdds, 658 - ddsdds, 659 - sddsds, 660 - sssdds. Line 661 is extremely fast with five dactyls in a row (ddddds), but then the concluding line (662) is slowed to a dragged pace with a triplet of mid-line spondees (dsssds). The sequence is one of mounting speed, relaxing toward the end. This corresponds precisely to Venus' thought. Her plan is easily con- ceived, speedily polished, efficiently arranged for execution. The speed and efficiency of these thoughts is re- flected in the meter of the lines and the metrical unity that they form. Venus' speech to Cupid also flows very fast, with a notable absence of paired spondees. It is unified in much the same way as the opening lines. Throughout the sequence the pen- themimeral caesura is kept in the background as line pushes on into line. Powerful words are given the privi- leged initial position: 19% of the lines begin with strong verbs - e.g., "incen- dat" (660), "urit" (662), "haeret" (718) - and 51% of the lines have nouns or strong adjectives in the first position - e.g., "Consilia" (658), "vocibus" (671), "quinquaginta" (703). These forceful opening words compel the reader to push on, uniting each line with the pre- ceding one. Add the light dactylic base, and the whole passage seems to fly by with ever increasing speed. It is this speed which makes three heavily spon- daic sections stand out in bold relief. The first of these sections occupies lines 686-690. Spondaic couplets and triplets fill these lines; line 688 con- tains five spondees. The lines drag slowly too because of the placement of the caesurae: each sense unit is set off by a pause; every syllable is slow and ponderous. Venus has been explaining her plan to Cupid, and in these lines she reaches her conclusion. Ascanius will be lulled to sleep and then Cupid in the guise of the little boy will linger in the embrace of Dido. The slowness of the lines reflects the deceitful lingering of the wily god on the bosom of the queen. The ominous undertones of mystery and suspense are shown by the hissing predominant in the passage: "laetissi- ma," "mensas," "amplexus," "oscula," "inspires," "fallasque." Deceitfulness and plotting will ensnare the mortals. Venus slows her speech to make sure that Cupid absorbs each word, every instruction; all the cunning crafts which the god possesses will be needed to carry out Venus' plan. The last two spondaic sections de- scribe the enactment of the plot itself. Multiple spondees again appear as As- canius is lulled to sleep and uplifted to the Idalian groves, as Cupid obeys his mother, as the queen and her guests as- semble in stately fashion for the banquet (1.694-699). When at last Venus has her way and Dido falls com- pletely under the spell of Cupid the spondees reach a maximum density (1.708-716). Line 709 is particularly emphatic: "mirantur dona Aeneae, mi- rantur Iulum" (ssssds), but all the lines here are drudgingly slow, broken again and again by caesurae. The amazement of the guests; the lingering of Cupid in the embrace first of Dido, then of Ae- neas; the tenseness and stealthy atmos- phere of the plot are all emphasized by the plodding spondaic lines. Metrical use and narrative sense are inextricably combined throughout this episode. What had originally appeared in Apollonius as an extended tale filled with detailed characterizations becomes in the Aeneid a taut, unified vignette. Apollonius' story about Eros, the repulsive child, has been reduced, metrically polished, and given a much more sophisticated plot. The result is a memorable showpiece celebrating, not Cupid's boyishness, but, rather, his godhead.</page></plain_text>
