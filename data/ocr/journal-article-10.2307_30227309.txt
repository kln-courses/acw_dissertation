<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERARD DE MALYNES AND EDWARD MISSELDEN The Learned Library of the Seventeenth- Century Merchant Andrea Finkelstein The stereotypical view of the seventeenth-century merchant is likely that of Thomas Mun's England's Treasure by Forraign Trade, posthumously pub- lished in 1664 but completed decades earlier.' The requisite "excellent qual- ities" enumerated by Mun grudgingly allowed the usefulness of an elementary knowledge of Latin, "although there be no necessity that such a Merchant should be a great Scholar" (ET 3). A knowledge of modern tongues and customs, of weights and measures, of bookkeeping and pen- manship figured much more prominently in an educational program in which learning was subordinated to the art of making the best deal. Of such a program Gradgrind himself might be proud, but how accurate a portrait of his contemporaries and predecessors has Mun painted? This essay uses a neglected source-the economic literature of the period-along with wills and inventories to flesh out the mental library of the seventeenth-century merchant, which was more learned than we may have imagined. There was a time when Mun's characterization was not only taken as the norm for the merchant proper but extended by analogy to cover the entire "Middle Class." That entity was ostensibly shaped by what Joseph Schum- peter called "the particular mental habits generated by the work in the busi- ness office," or what R. H. Tawney called the "spirit of modern business" or Max Weber the "Capitalist Geist."2 A more nuanced but curiously ho- mogenous view appeared in Louis B. Wright's classic Middle-Class Culture in Elizabethan England (1935). While admitting that the lines between the</page><page sequence="2">2 BoOK HISTORY three classes (aristocratic, middle, and peasant) were porous and that the learned professionals in the upper rank shared many values with the middle, Wright saw a central group composed of "merchants, tradesfolk, and skilled craftsmen" whose "thoughts and interests centered in business profits" and formed a distinct mentality rooted in the virtues of "thrift," "sturdy independence," "honesty," and ambition for both economic and self-improvement.3 He shows us a class enjoying classic literature as much as sensational plays, teaching itself ancient as well as modern languages, and endowing schools.4 But there is still a deep utilitarian undercurrent in the constant emphasis on the skills apprentices need to become successful merchants.5 And there is an assumption that all subgroups within this "Middle Class" had uniform tastes: the "class" model colors the reading of the evidence. This schema has been challenged of late by an alternative revolving around the phrase "middling sort"-a phrase that at least has the advantage of being of the period, if not in common usage in a sociological sense until the 1620s.6 While free of the ideological overtones of "Middle Class," the phrase "middling sort" also tends to homogenize the great variety of lives encompassed therein. "Economically more fragmented that the poor or the landed elite," as Jonathan Barry has noted, this was a disparate group- politically, economically, and religiously-with little in common except "the need to work for their income using skill and engaging in a trade or profes- sion, rather than relying on rentier income or labouring in another's em- ployment."7 In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, merchant was a term normally applied only to the import-export trader. Although not all merchants rose to the level of financial oligarches (even in the heyday of the joint stock companies), as a group they were the commercial elite, the closest thing the age offered to a "Capitalist." Were they, then, possessed of a "Middle Class" Weltanschauung, or were they as various as their neighbors among the "middling sort"? Among the records commonly used to reconstruct the lives and values of the "middling sort" are the wills and death-inventories they left behind. With their assorted bequests and lists of household furnishings, these pro- vide valuable clues to family relationships and standards of living. They also impress upon us how literate this society was, at all but the lowest levels. That the local gentry, physician, lawyer, or clerk had books to bequeath is not surprising. But despite their relative expense, William Edwards of Pakenham left his books to "the use of my fellow servants at Pakenham Hall in common for their use and reading at fit and convenient times of their leisure."8 When the wills of all the yeomen who at least owned a Bible or Foxe's Book of Martyrs are put together with the wills of their social</page><page sequence="3">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 3 betters among the middling sort and added to the information available on titles, editions, press runs, and booksellers' inventories, we get a picture of a population eager for news, actively engaged in controversy, and trying so hard to educate themselves they threaten to swallow the world whole: the specialized knowledge of foreign languages, navigation, medicine, history, and law missing from their formal education waits for them (in London and other major urban centers at least) at the local bookstore.9 But a second look at those wills and inventories presents a more problem- atic picture. There are six merchants and three mercers represented in the Wills of the Archdeaconry of Suffolk, 1620-1624 and nary a mention of a book among them, though John Harper of Dunwich carefully distributes every blanket, stool, fire pan, pillow, napkin, and twilted silk cap he owns.10 On the other hand, nine of the forty-three individuals who still owed money to the York bookseller John Foster at his death were tradesmen, and the single merchant among them had an outstanding debt of 10 shillings and 8 pence."1 Richard Grassby's Business Community of Seventeenth-Century England documents the existence later in the century of a small group of merchant bibliophiles who spent their Saturdays book hunting and left chained libraries to their endowed schools-and a greater commercial com- munity that generally owned at least a few books outside the requisite pro- fessional manuals (though works of history and literature were rarely in evidence before 1640).12 While the largest libraries have been catalogued, what lies behind the unnamed "books" left to friends and family in those wills? And which of the inventoried books were purchased for utilitarian reasons and which read for pleasure? Which arguments in those works did the merchants agree with and which not? Turning to the works they themselves left behind offers a body of evidence, which, when studied in conjunction with the wills and inventories, helps flesh out our picture of their mental universe. Gerard de Malynes (fl. 1586-1626) was a slightly older contemporary of Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) and William Shakespeare (1564-1616).13 A part-time spy for Robert Cecil14 and an independent merchant with nothing good to say about the East India Company, his was a career shaped by the cut-throat nature of Elizabethan commerce: he was imprisoned once for fraud over cargo confiscated from a Spanish ships1 and once for bankruptcy when his partners in a lead farthing deal insisted on paying him in their own coin.16 Although he gives his family's place of origin as Lancashire, Gerard was born in Antwerp (LM 263) and first appears in English records as a member of the Dutch Church in London, where in 1586 he pledged 20 shillings per year to a fund the Church was raising "for the support of se- lected students of their congregation at Cambridge University and else-</page><page sequence="4">4 BOOK HISTORY where."''17 But his command of English lends support to the thesis that his father, an assay master, relocated the family to accept employment during the great recoinage of 1561.18 A frequent consultant to government commissions on matters of trade whose expertise was acknowledged even by his antagonists, Malynes was the author of six books that are still consulted by researchers in the history of economic thought.19 A Treatise of the Canker of Englands Common- wealth (1601) and St. George for England, Allegorically Described (1601) dissected and attacked the international market in money, while Englands View in the Unmasking of Two Paradoxes (1603) contested the American treasure explanation for the price revolution advanced by Jean Bodin.20 The Maintenance of Free Trade (1622) and The Center of the Circle of Com- merce (1623) foreshadowed the quantity theory of money while dealing with the decade's trade depression, while his Consuetudo vel Lex Mercato- ria (1622) remained a standard merchant's manual throughout the cen- tury.21 Favorable seventeenth-century references to his work can be found in works as varied as Lewes Robert's competing merchants' manual, the Merchants Mappe of Commerce (1638), and William Lowndes's Further Essay for the Amendment of the Gold and Silver Coins (1695). Thomas Mun's England's Treasure (1664) attacked his conclusions but conceded that Malynes was "skilful in many things which he hath both written and collected concerning th' affairs of Merchants."22 Malynes was, as one might expect, learned in his field. He could cull references from both common and civil law: he knew his Fortescue (LM 471-73) and St. German (LM 461) as well as he did his Straccia, Aquinas, and Scotus (LM 375, 452). He could cite medieval maritime laws from Genoa (1186), Marseilles (1162), Venice (1262), and Aragon (1270 and 1340) as easily as he could those of Antoninus or the latest change in the "Sea-Lawes of the Haunce Townes, made in the year 1614" (LM 120, 167, 175). He consulted English histories-by Grafton, Malmsbury, and Hollin- shed (LM 187-89)-closely and often for the evolution of royal commercial policy. He had at least a passing acquaintance with Guicciardini and Frois- sart (LM 189). And he kept abreast of the latest Continental economic theo- ries, and in their native tongues (EV 65, 118). But his greatest usefulness for modern researchers may lie entirely outside the arena of economics. Word for word, more than half his output has nothing to do with ex- change rates, assay ratios, weights and measures, mercantile law, or book- keeping, although there is plenty of that. Scattered throughout his works are mini treatises on color theory (LM 54-55), estimates of the Earth's age (LM 10-11), calendar systems ancient and modern (LM 11-12, 15-16), Hermetic and Pythagorean number theory (LM 17-18), Galenic physiology (LM 486), and Paracelsian alchemical theory (LM 258-59).</page><page sequence="5">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 5 He took an independent stance with regard to established authority, whether contemporary or classical, clerical or secular. He refuted Dr. Thomas Wilson's Discourse uppon Usurye (1572), the standard anti- interest tract of his day, point by point,23 and discounted Aristotle's anti- commercial stance as written in an ignorance born of living in trade's infancy (FT 37-38 and LM 62, 486). He ridiculed the communalism of Plato's Re- public (EV 118-19) and More's Utopia (CA 1-2) alike. And he put his money where his mouth was even when it was not politic to do so, sending King James I his recommendations for adopting the Gregorian calendar.24 Malynes was intensely proud of the scope of his learning. When he apol- ogized to his readers for a digression on the Lapis philosophorum as "being farre from the merchants profession," it was in the nature of a boast rather than a proposed limitation on studies appropriate to the merchant (LM 258). It suggests, as well, that there was a widening rift within the mercan- tile community itself over its own identity. The lists of "excellent qualities" required of merchants that appear in so many of these pamphlets (whether or not intended as merchant's manuals) range far beyond the question of the skills necessary to keep books or know good cloth from bad.25 Since we do not know for certain whether Malynes was raised in England or near Antwerp, we can only speculate about his education. The history of the Dutch Church in London during his childhood is complex: chartered in 1550, its members were forced to take refuge on the Continent after Mary's accession, began returning in 1559, and had their Church rechartered in 1560.26 The Church originally had its own school, but after it was reestab- lished members sent their children to English schools or made use of the services of independent Dutch schoolmasters living in London.27 Franciscus Marquinas, an Italian silkworker who had set up as a schoolmaster in 1580, offered courses to twenty-four church members' children in Latin, reading, writing, arithmetic, and accounting in Dutch and English.28 Beyond this basic level, Malynes appears to have been self-taught. What, then, did Malynes think appropriate reading for a merchant in training? Judging by his self-instruction, he would have had every appren- tice merchant begin with the "Classics." In fact, despite his grammar school Latin and lack of Greek, the "Classics" seem to have been Malynes's great- est passion.29 His biblical references (emphasis on the Old Testament) are numerous, but classical to biblical his citations run at about 5:3. Despite his disdain for Aristotle's views of commerce, Malynes was a devoted student of the Politics (CA 5-6), the Ethics (LM 205), the Physics (MFT 38), and the Metaphysics (CCC 43).30 He knew his Ptolemy (LM 62) and had at least a passing acquaintance with Euclid (MFT 85). Many of the works he mentions or draws upon were already available in English, and where he merely paraphrases we cannot know in which language he read for pleasure,</page><page sequence="6">6 BOOK HISTORY but he could cite Cato (EV 1) and Cicero (LM 60) in the original, and find just the right verse from Horace (CCC 137; Odes IV.ii.1-4) or Ovid (CCC 80; Metamorphoses 111.715) or Virgil (MFT 105; Aeneid VI.29-30) with which to skewer an opponent. He also knew his "Civilians" in Latin (LM 375, 452). He sees no shame in admitting to using Attic Nights (LM Epis- tle), so we know he sometimes got his citations secondhand. But we also know his knowledge went beyond the schoolboy's texts: when it came to Cato, for example, he knew the De re rustica as well as the Distichb (LM 60, 329; EV 1; MFT 5, 39, 83), and Procopius (MFT 48) was not part of the grammar school canon. He mined the works of Strabo (LM 120), Pliny (LM 120), Suetonius (LM 146, SG 39), and Procopius as much for moral exempla as for evidence of ancient commercial practice: he retold Plutarch's story of Sertorius and the pulling out of the horse's tail, hair by hair, with obvious relish (MFT 59). He treated his readers to Pliny's story of the pearl Cleopatra dissolved in vinegar to impress Marc Antony (LM 197). From Suetonius came the ex- ploits of Publius Clodius, who disguised himself as a woman to make a play for Caesar's wife (SG 39). And nothing in Procopius interested him as much as did the possible meanings of Belisaurius's "squint" (MFT 48). There were exempla from Virgil, too: Sinon, who convinced the Trojans to bring in the wooden horse (SG 49), and Manilus Torquatus, whose passion for justice would not let him spare even his own son (SG 27). But Ovid remained for Malynes (as he had for Shakespeare) the most frequented source.31 In the works of Malynes appeared not only the better-known figures of Midas (SG 28), Tantalus (SG 28), and Icarus (SG 37), but also Polyxena, doomed to be sacrificed on Achilles' tomb (SG 50), and Ixion, bound to a whirling wheel in punishment for attempting intercourse with Juno (LM 499). Ma- lynes was almost as fond of Aesop's tales: he regaled his readers with the tale of the jackdaw's borrowed plumes (SG 38), the dog who snatched at the "shadow of the flesh" (SG 43), and the hapless thieves who stole a crowing cock (SG 35).32 This tied into his faith in folk wisdom in general: in his pages were pointed references to Canute's attempt to command the tides (SG 35), patient Griselda (SG 54), the "Indian Ants or Emmets, who gather the gold and keep it, although they cannot use it" (SG 29), and "the wolves of Styria, which delight to bark against the moon" (SG 30).33 But be his sources highly literary or low, the wisdom Malynes treasured most was, like the remedies he proposed, essentially moral: there had yet been no parting of the cultures for Gerard de Malynes. Still, he belonged to a moment in time in which there was a growing attempt to discipline popu- lar culture, and elements of that change could be seen in his condemnations of those who lived licentiously or spent "their stockes by prodigall riot" (SG 21-22).34 And those were just the idle rich. As to the idle poor, best to</page><page sequence="7">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 7 "set [them] on worke," or plant them in Roman-style colonies to prevent them from stirring up "more commotions" (LM 229, 234). But he did not read only for edification, even of a moral sort. Malynes also loved certain authors so greatly for their literary skill that he borrowed great chunks of their work without attribution. His St. George for England reproduced the first several lines of the "General Prologue" to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales before decking out his text in figure of speech after figure of speech from Thomas More's Utopia (despite his dislike for Utopia's com- munalism).35 Malynes lived in a world in which a new learning was competing with the old. This was, after all, the heyday of Paracelsianism in England.36 Malynes had read John Dee's work, which was full of Neo-Hermetic and Paracelsian ideas, but he had also "read all the bookes of Paracelsus" that he "could find," and included a large chunk of the De Transmutatione Rerum for his readers' edification (LM 258-59). The most likely source for all of this (as well as for his generous if somewhat confused borrowings from Galen) was a friend Malynes described as an unfortunate physician who succumbed "to a burning ague after a long illness" (LM 256-58).37 He was also well versed in the humbler sciences of his day, recommending "Master Hill his booke of husbandrie" for its information on beekeeping (LM 233), the work of Tobias Gentleman on fishing (LM 242), and of Mr. Markham on "hunts- manship" (CCC 85). It is possible that beekeeping was more than a literary interest; the Lex Mercatoria contains a long section on the art, a treatise well enough thought of to be reprinted by Samuel Hartlib in his Reformed Commonwealth of the Bees (1655).38 Perhaps Gerard's expertise in this matter was gained in practice. Malynes's interest in the sciences-applied and theoretical-and his as- sumption that they were not outside the purview of the "middling sort" tapped into another aspect of his age's changing attitude toward learning. Malynes believed humans must "obey the knowne will of God" and "rever- ence (with admiration) his secret will not declared unto us" (LM 205). He damned the mercantile exchange on the grounds that, the valuation of the coin being a matter of "the sovereignty and dignity of the Prince," it was a matter "of too high presumption for subjects to step into"(CA 14, 56). This was the political embodiment of the ground Carlo Ginzburg characterized as "a separate sphere of 'highness' (cosmic, religious, political) which was forbidden to human knowledge."" 39 Ginzburg used a change in the depiction of Icarus in emblem books to trace changes in seventeenth-century attitudes toward science.40 Soaring on "Icarian" wings was the epitome of folly in the estimation of Gerard de Malynes (CCC 137), but Malynes actually be- longed to that transitional point in Ginzburg's thesis in which science, al-</page><page sequence="8">8 BOOK HISTORY though not yet politics or religion, was no longer forbidden knowledge to those outside the control of their institutional guardians. Malynes kept abreast of the voyages of Drake and Cavendish (LM 182), and the discovery of "Terra Australis incognita" by Ferdinand de Quir in 1615 (LM 236). He was fascinated by cartography, arguing against the straight-line representa- tion of meridians of longitude adopted by Mercator (LM 185), and organiz- ing the entire text of his last treatise (The Center of the Circle of Commerce) around the climate "zones" formed by the Arctic and Antarctic Circles and the two Tropics. He was fascinated by the size of the Earth ("5400 Geomet- ricall Miles, or 21600 ordinarie Miles") and his country's portion of it ("29 million, 568 thousand acres") (LM 66).41 And, counting by parishes, he estimated (somewhat overoptimistically) that there were 16.8 million peo- ple in England (EV 135-37). He shared an interest in all aspects of agricul- tural and commercial improvement as well as a preference for state- managed development with Sir Francis Bacon. In his books were schemes for transnational trade councils (LM 242), new coinages (LM 386), and regulated loans for the working classes (LM 335), arguments for patent protection (LM 215-16) and for new plantations (LM 234) as well as im- provements to fishing and navigation (CCC 127). But there were places where the new science went that Gerard de Ma- lynes would not follow. He reviled the "imaginarie" mathematics of Coper- nican theory for ignoring Aristotelian physics (LM 62, 184). He would admit only those elements of the new science that did not threaten the moral order supported by the old. His sharpest condemnation in this light was reserved for Pyrrhonic Skepticism: "For some men (upon private respects) will cast doubts beyond the Moone..... And to the other I may say, Know you not that the skeptike Doctrine of Pyrrho, Aristen, and Herillus, hath been long agoe hist out of the Schooles, or rather banisht and confined amongst the Barbarians? Will you cause us to doubt of all things: then shall we doubt whether you doubt or no" (CCC 123-24). The first man to accuse Gerard de Malynes of plagiarism was Edward Mis- selden (fl. 1608-54), an ally of Thomas Mun (1571-1641) and an antago- nist of Malynes in the pamphlet wars of the 1620s over the causes of the decade's trade depression in which Misselden and Mun supported Trade Balance theory against Malynes's view that currency speculation was the root of all evil. Deriding those who denied an author "the honour of his owne" (CC 45-46),42 Misselden claimed that "from one end to the other" the books of Gerard de Malynes were "piec't together with stollen stuffe" (CC 29).43 Harold Ogden White has demonstrated the existence throughout the sixteenth and well into the seventeenth century of a fairly consistent (if not always honored) tradition in this regard. Based on classical models,</page><page sequence="9">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 9 English Renaissance writers understood originality as creative adaptation of the themes and styles of canonical models, disparaged simple copying as much as they did absolute innovation, and considered copious unacknowl- edged borrowing "theft"-the word plagiarism (kidnapping) not coming into common usage until the 1630s.44 By the standards of the day, Malynes would seem to be guilty of literary theft, at least for the larger chunks of appropriated (and uncited) material. Despite his attack on Malynes, Misselden could be as slavish a copier as his adversary. A series of citations in Free Trade from classical authors in sup- port of trade contains one purporting to be from Seneca (along with Missel- den's translation of the same). But the passage is actually a citation from Grotius's Mare Liberum in which Grotius paraphrased a passage from Sene- ca's Natural Questions on the wind. The bit of indirect citing on Missel- den's part is revealed by his copying Grotius's citation of the passage as Natural Questions 111.4 when it is more likely V.18.4 (Book III being about rivers).45 Was Misselden equally guilty? The tradition cited by White was essentially a literary one; less well established genres were having to make up their own rules. Pioneers in the fields of history and geography, such as Richard Hakluyt, favored simple (but acknowledged) copying and were beginning to use citations for paraphrased material as well, but White him- self discusses the frequent and essentially unnoticed copying in the age's "muck-raking pamphlets."46 Malynes and Misselden were engaged in just such a pamphlet war. But they were also part of the construction of a rela- tively new genre that we might call the policy manual of political economics. As such, they were pioneers in establishing its rules. Although Misselden occasionally relied upon (without so revealing) a citation in a secondary source, his criticisms of Malynes show us a pioneer in one genre consciously seeking to establish its legitimacy by adopting the rules of more established forms. They are also evidence that Misselden was well-enough read to be aware of those rules. Ironically, neither merchant explicitly considered any relationship between intellectual property and property per se. Born in Hackney, Edward Misselden came up through the ranks of the Mer- chant Adventurers' Company, becoming deputy-governor of its branch at Delft (1623-33) while, through his contacts with Thomas Mun, negotiating with Amsterdam on behalf of the English East India Company. Serving two masters is never easy: in 1628, Edward Misselden was accused by the States- General of spying for England and by Carleton, the English ambassador at the Hague, of working for the Dutch against the interests of both compa- nies. The accusation by the States-General was no more unusual in Missel- den's case than in that of Malynes: in the infancy of bureaucratization, governments gathered their foreign intelligence from whatever sources were</page><page sequence="10">10 BOOK HISTORY at hand, and merchants were likely informants. Misselden's professional life became even more complicated when he supported Archbishop Laud's attempt to impose liturgical uniformity on the "strongly presbyterian" Mer- chant Adventurers in Delft.47 Misselden's stand cost him his post at Delft and the chance to become deputy-governor at Rotterdam in 1635 (by which time the King's efforts on his behalf likely did him more harm than good).48 With the King's eventual defeat, Misselden lost whatever influence he had once had: letters to Cromwell's advisers went unanswered and Misselden's works were overshadowed by Mun's (despite the reliance of the latter on Misselden's Balance of Trade theory). Misselden appears to have submitted a "Treatise" on "Ecclesiastical Pol- icy" to Archbishop Laud's office, nothing of which remains excepting Laud's note that "the Treatise itself is very fair, and against the lay-eldership directly" on a list of some objectionable passages.49 He wrote no all-encom- passing merchants' manual, but the preponderance of classical over biblical citations is even greater in Misselden's two slim volumes-Free Trade, or the Means to Make Trade Flourish (1622) and The Circle of Commerce (1623)-than in Malynes's more massive works. Where he acquired his erudition has not been discovered. We know he believed in higher education enough to send his son Samuel to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but Edward Misselden's name has not yet been found in any university records.50 As an apprentice to a member of the Merchant Adventurers' Company, he would have been given training in bookkeeping and arithmetic, penmanship, business correspondence, business practices, and some exposure to cosmography, navigation and modern languages.51 He would also have learned "a set of family and educational values" encom- passing charity, probity, and decorousness.52 Although there were excep- tions, apprenticeship normally began at about fourteen years of age or later,s3 making it an alternative to the university as a form of secondary education, following at least a few terms in grammar school. The grammar school attended might be one sponsored by the apprenticing field: the Mer- chant Taylors, for example, endowed such a school in 1561.54 Misselden's knowledge of Latin and Greek would likely have been acquired in grammar school, though the general run of the grammar schools of the period was much stronger in Latin than in Greek.55 It is possible, but not as likely, that he picked up some Hebrew there.s6 If not, grammars in these languages were available at various booksellers, and readers who made it their business to know which booksellers specialized in which fields might not find it all that difficult to browse through or acquire histories, legal texts, statute books, the latest rediscovered classical text or works from the evolving modern canon. They would even find numerous books complaining about the inor-</page><page sequence="11">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 11 dinate amount of garbage being printed, driving out the quality in this "printing age" where "every red-nosed rimester is an author."s7 Searching through the sources on whose works Misselden depended for his causes immediate and remote, primary and secondary, particular and gen- eral, active and passive, we will find Aristotle and his categories (CC 40- 43), Pacius and his Commentaries on Aristotle (CC 11), Aquinas (CC 93), Bartolus (FT 39), Straccia (FT 20), and a host of other civilians paraded before our eyes in digressions whose primary purpose is to prove that Ma- lynes, whose Latin was not as fine as Misselden's, could not even distinguish "the Principles of naturall things from their Essence" or "Matter from Forme and the Privation thereof" (CC 9 and 11-13).58 No analysis of the ways of transferring property passes by without a critique of Malynes's un- derstanding of Scotus (CC 93).59 The Scholastic strain ran as deep in Missel- den's mind as in his adversary's.60 But jumbled amid the Scholastic sources were Virgil (CC 96) and Columella (FT 133), Cato (FT 13) and Tacitus (FT 67), Cicero (FT 134) and Seneca (FT 25-26), Horace (FT 66) and Ovid (FT 38), Hesiod (FT 25-26), Pliny (FT 21), Plato (CC Ded.), and Maimonides (FT 121), and from a later day Ramus (CC 73), Bodin (FT 122), Althusius (FT 57), Joseph Scaliger (FT Ded.), Grotius (FT 36), and Sir Thomas More (FT 20) among others. In Misselden's heavy use of citations in (and from) the original Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, we can see the trilingual educational program favored by such "Catholic" Humanists as Erasmus and More as well as by such Humanist-trained "Protestant" rebels as Calvin.61 Although he had more languages than Malynes and a deeper understand- ing of Scholastic philosophy, the range of his interests seems not to have been as wide. But even within those narrower bonds a contemporary reader could find nearly as much of art history (Giotto's ability to draw a perfect circle freehand), geometry (doubling cubes and "the Quadrature" of cir- cles),62 chemistry (whether there were four elements or ten and which phi- losopher espoused which system [CC 11]),63 mythology (Cadmus's serpents' teeth [CC 42]), or legal and constitutional theory (the difference between jus and consuetudo, malum prohibitum and malum in se, or the proper uses of the dispensing power [FT 37, 61-62])-as of exchange rates or book- keeping in Misselden's tracts. And the world view revealed in those volumes was as conservative as that of his main opponent. We may begin to reconstruct both Misselden's physics and metaphysics from remarks such as "Great Philip of Macedon, suffered a mean musician to say unto him, Absit, ut haec tu me melius scias.... Everything moves it selfe to its Center" (FT Ded.), or "the other Great Lights in the Spheares thereof" (FT 2). Thus the "ballance of trade" was introduced as the "Cen- ter" to which the "Circle of Commerce" must "contract" (FT 3), and "the</page><page sequence="12">12 BOOK HISTORY finenes of monies" was "that Cynosure or Center, whereunto all Ex- changes" had "their naturall propension" (CC 97). Here we find ourselves in the same anthropomorphic universe of nested "cosms" as drawn for us by Malynes: "Neverthelesse when I looke upon the Face of the Great body politique of this Weale publicke, and therein consider the High wisdome of His sacred Majesty, as the intellectual part of this Microcosme, or alter orbis as Caesar calles it: the Prudence &amp; Providence of His Nobles, as the Eyes thereof; the great decay of Trade, the Nerves thereof" (FT 4). And here is the same tincture of Alchemy with its Similarities and Sympathies used to explain the importance of "the Restauration of Trade, wherein all of us by Sympathie have our part, and feele the waight; the very Vinculum amicitiae (CC Epistle). And, like Malynes, Misselden sought a regulated "Restaura- tion," for, as he said: "a Restraint of the Publique Liberty ... is alwayes to be allowed, when the same is recompenced with a Publique Utility. Accord- ing to that of Tacitus, Omne magnum exemplum habet in se aliquid iniqui, quod utilitate publica contra sinulos compensatur" (FT 67-68).64 State reg- ulation brought up the old problem of "high and low," which was, in the hands of Misselden's generation slowly being transformed into raison d'dtat: "To find out the causes of things, is a worke of Philosophy, and much Felicity, to find out a fit Remedy, is of high Eminency: But to apply the Remedy, is a matter of State and Policy" (FT 6). In the second edition of Misselden's Free Trade is a pointed defense of the erudition displayed in the first: Some men aske me, Quorsum haec lactura? Wherefore all this cost and waste of learning &amp; languages, in the trodden way of Trade? And tell me that I seem to plow with others Heyfers, as if it were not contingent to a Merchant, to be acquainted with the Muses. Surely it is with many, the price of these paines: that litterae and litterati non habent inimicum praeter ignorantem ... thinke that learning and languages are an Appendix not unnecessary to the fa- cultie of a Merchant (FT Ded.) The same division within the mercantile community that we saw in the self- justification of Malynes appears within those of his rival. Far from having resolved the matter, the passing of a generation has seen a widening of the problem, for it is clear from Misselden's defense of his learning that the reading public at large had not kept up with the old ways: it was getting more difficult to find readers in any field who did not need their citations translated for them:</page><page sequence="13">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 13 Bodin, the great Politician of France, in his bookes De Republica, and therein also of Merchants and Merchandize, doth so oft cite Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine testimonies. The like doth Grotius that learned Netherlander, in his Mare Liberum, his Free Sea Trade, and other of his Workes. And this did that famous Orator M.T. Cicero, the Master of Eloquence, both practice himself, and command to his sonne .... I know it is growne in use in this Kingdome, to cite in speech and writing, the Translation for the Originall. But surely it is more common, then commendable. .... For if the Text be He- brew, and it bee rendered in Greeke; or Greeke, and rendered in Latine, or as the manner is, to cite Latine for both; neither the Au- thor hath any honour, nor the Auditor benefite. (CC 45-46)65 What is even more revealing is the way Misselden defended his erudition by aligning his texts with those of the more venerable fields of moral and politi- cal discourse. Here his mix of ancient and modern sources helps fill in our picture of the evolving canon: Bodin and Grotius had become instant "clas- sics." Backing up his mere merchant's opinions with those of the more learned classes, he could give his reader Joseph Scaliger's Carmen de Mirandis Bata- vie on the miraculous bounty the cloth, wheat, and wine trades had pro- cured for a land in which flocks of sheep, fields of wheat, and vineyards were scarce if at all to be found (FT Ded.).66 Here Misselden understood he had more to defend than the learning of his calling; he had to defend the calling itself. He might claim that Merchants were "of high account in all parts of the world (CC 17)," but whereas "the States and States-men, Gov- ernours, Counsellors, and Magistrates of Venice, Luca, Genoa, Florence, the United Provinces of the Low Countries, and many other well governed Commonwealths, are by education Merchants" (CC 19), this was not the case in England, where the opposition was led by the Crown. "Merchants," said James I, thinke the whole common-weale ordeined for making them up; and accounting it their lawfull gaine and trade, to enrich themselves upon the losse of all the rest of the people; they transport from us things necessarie; bringing backe sometimes unnecessary things and at other times nothing at all. They buy for us the worst wares and sell them at the dearest prices . . . being as constant in their evill custome, as if it were settled Law for them. They are also the spe- ciall cause of the corruption of the coyne, transporting all our owne, and bringing in forraine, upon what price they please to set on it.67</page><page sequence="14">14 BOOK HISTORY And a disdain for the mercantile classes was hardly unique to James I. Mis- selden would have found them underpinning the absence of a monetary economy in the very same Utopia he cited as one of his proofs that commod- ities and not money were the original life-blood of (and still the ultimate force behind) trade (CC 20, 95). This attitude survived the political upheav- als through which Misselden lived. Archbishop Laud, whose efforts to im- pose ceremonial uniformity Misselden had endorsed, believed that there was "no private end, but in something or other it will be led to run cross the public; and, if gain come in, though it be by 'making shrines for Diana,' it is no matter with them though Ephesus be in an uproar for it."68 James Harrington of republican fame restricted the influence of the merchants, shopkeepers, and artisans of The Commonwealth of Oceana to (and by) their self-censoring ward and guild system.69 Such a deeply held prejudice against the mercantile classes goes far to explain one exculpatory passage in which Misselden did his best to assimi- late the pursuit of gain to the pursuit of family honor (and estate) of the gentle classes: "Merchants are wont to make it their glory, to advance their fortunes, renowne their names, embellize their houses, beautifie their fami- lies with the honour of this faculty: and to perpetuate the fame unto posteri- ties, as an hereditary title of honour unto their name and blood" (CC 18). The recurring trade crises of the seventeenth century brought forth a flood of curative proposals from merchants and nonmerchants alike. These pam- phlets have most often been consulted by modern scholars in light of their economic views, a natural enough endeavor: they are, after all, first and foremost, litmus tests of the state of the age's economic theory. But, remem- bering that some merchants, at least, considered their learning an important part of their "glory," we might do well to search these works for their views of matters far from economic. Keeping in mind the caveat that most mer- chants (like most members of any profession or status) did not write books (and thus those who did form a nonrandom sample), this look at the works of Gerard de Malynes and Edward Misselden might suggest a starting point for such a search.

His birth year is unknown, but referring to a commission on which he served in 1600- 1601, Malynes (LM 281) remarked on his "owne knowledge concerning assayes ... observed and knowne above fortie yeares, my father also having beene a Mint-master." Taking the forty years to mean professional experience rather than the casual knowledge obtained in his father's household would put his birth at mid-century. His date of death is equally obscure, but Lynn Muchmore presented an excellent case for supposing it to be before 1627 rather than after 1641, as was previously supposed, given an undated petition from Malynes calendared in the State Papers in 1641.

De Roover's proposed link to an aldermanic family in Melechen is intriguing, but he admits no record has been found of Gerard in Belgium. Nor is Roover aware of the complex makeup of the "foreign" church in London: by 1600 many of its members were English subjects, being the descendants of denizated and naturalized fore- bears. For this, see Grell, Dutch Calvinists, 8. 19. Modern opinions have varied widely. Johnson dismissed him as "a pathetic advocate of medieval justice who could not understand the amorality of the modern market," while Schumpeter believed no seventeenth-century writer "surpassed him in clear and full under- standing of the international mechanism of foreign exchanges that works through price levels and gold and silver movements." Letwin concluded that his books "were to economic theory as an engineer's manual is to theoretical mechanics," while Spiegel claimed Malynes came closer than anyone before David Hume to solving the problem of "the automatic flow of specie</page><page sequence="17">MALYNES AND MISSELDEN 17 and attending changes in prices" that was "to bring the curtain down on mercantilist thought."

The "treasure" theory in question was advanced in Bodin's La Response de Jean Bodin aux Paradoxes de Malestroit touchant l'encherissement de toutes choses et le moyen d'y remed- ier (1576), which itself contested Malestroit's debasement theory. 21. It was reprinted in 1629 [STC 17223], 1636 [STC 17224], 1656 [STC-Wing M364], and 1685 [STC-Wing M364a]. A "third edition" appeared in 1686 [STC-Wing M365]. 22.

Compare [STC 25857] Thomas Wilson's A Discourse uppon Usurye (London: R. Tot- telli, 1572), ed. R. H. Tawney (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1963), 236, 241, 285, 301, and 313, with Malynes (CA 56, 113; FT 2; and LM 64, 236). Malynes's liberal use of uncited passages from Wilson has led Raymond de Roover to label him "addicted to plagiarism" without an idea in his head not cribbed from some scholastic text. For which, see Raymond De Roover, "Scholasticism and Mercantilism: A Contrast," in Essays in Economic Thought: Aristotle to Marshall, ed. Joseph J. Spengler and William R. Allen (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1960), 96. But De Roover missed the changes Malynes made in the arguments he copied. In Wilson's dialogue the preacher refuted the lawyer's defense of commercial interest; Malynes copied the lawyer's argument in order to defend it. Wilson discussed "bankes of charitye" only to condemn them; Malynes supported the institution of a Mons pietatis. De Roover's disparagement of "mercantile" authors has been noted even by his advocates; see Julius Kirsh- ner, "Raymond de Roover on Scholastic Economic Thought," in de Roover, Business, 35. Of all these writers, de Roover seems hardest on Malynes; there is an almost personal animus. Notice that the article on Malynes from this collection (already cited) is as much about the Royal Commission of 1564 and its dependence on the work of Thomas Gresham as it is about Malynes. For this, see de Roover, "Malynes," 359-62, 364-65. 24. Malynes could be politically obtuse in the extreme. That he had sent his calendar recommendations to James in 1604 was one thing (Lex Mercatoria, 16), but to boast in 1622 of having done so after quoting from a 1609 speech in which James revealed his hatred of the reform was quite another. For the king's speech, see [STC 14344] James I, The Political Works of James I (London: R. Barker at J. Bill, 1616), reprint, ed. Charles Howard McIlwain (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1918), 311. For passages "plagiarized" by Malynes, compare ibid., 55, 64, and 307, with the dedication to James I in the Lex Mercatoria. 25. Malynes's "compleate merchant" checklist appears in Lex Mercatoria, 6-7. It includes arithmetic, weights and measures, political and physical geography, customs regulations, cur- rency alloys and exchange rates, shipbuilding, insurance, and bookkeeping in addition to his more "heterodox" ideas. 26.

In 1638 the church adver- tised for a general schoolmaster proficient only in English, French, and Dutch, reserving the classical curriculum for a smaller number of students being prepared for university rather than apprenticeship. For which, see ibid., 113. 29. He was extremely sensitive about his lack of Greek: thus his preemptive strike at Ed-</page><page sequence="18">18 BOOK HISTORY ward Misselden (whose books are replete with Greek, Latin, and Hebrew citations) as that "Babylon of learning" (CCC 1, 116). Except for the odd, and not always correct or correctly spelled, derivation (e.g., monopoly: from uovoo and jrwLto [sic] in LM 214) so common it could have come from any of his Scholastic sources, Greek is nowhere used in his works. An inveterate name-dropper as well, he would certainly have paraded any university degree before his readers if he had one. 30. The Politics is cited or used most often; the Ethics least often. 31. See Robert Kilburn Root, Classical Mythology in Shakespeare (New York: Gordian, 1965; originally published in 1903) 3-4, on the predominance of Ovid over Virgil (&gt;4:1) as the source for Shakespeare's citations. 32. More fables appear in FT, 26; and CCC 17, 19, and 112. 33. His interpretations of these tales, however, were not always accurate, as, for example, his take on Canute: "king Kanutus who in this Iland would have commaunded the waters [SG 35]." 34. See Peter Burke, Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978), 208, 212, 270-81, on the growing gap between the two cultures and popular license as bearing the brunt of the attack. 35. An analysis of the use made of More's Utopia in St. George (in addition to borrowings from other authors) can be found in Helen E. Sandison, "An Elizabethan Economist's Method of Literary Composition," Huntington Library Quarterly 6, no. 2 (February 1943): 205-11. Thanks to his slavish copying, she was able to pinpoint the particular edition (via copied errors) Malynes used, the 1597 edition of Robinson's translation of Utopia (ibid., 207). Ma- lynes did not, however, read More merely for his literary devices; there was also an extensive analysis of the incident of the Flatulentine ambassadors (EV 98-103). 36.

The physician might have been the Kelley mentioned as having some connection with an experiment using "seven glasses" (to distill the "'Lapis Philosophorum, by the operation of the Sunne, in seven years") like the "glass" sold by the physician's widow. Or he might have been the unnamed man Malynes saw turn lead into mercury only to die (presumably from the ill effects of his success) three months later. The problem is that Malynes was enough of a snob to name his famous friends (such as Raleigh and Drake), but not those, like the physician, who moved in less exalted circles. 38.

See Joan Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1966), 373, however, for Mulcaster's attack on such Merchant endowments as "counterfeit liberality."

See ibid., 118-19, on the even greater rarity of Hebrew. The imbalance between Latin on the one hand and Greek and Hebrew on the other extended to the university level; for which, see ibid., 159. But note the remark of Sir James Whitelocke (118) that he was taught all three languages at the Merchant Taylors School. Whitelocke, a merchant's son, went on to Oxford and the inns of court. If Misselden was sent to this institution, it might account for his unusual level of erudition. Note also Baptist Goodall's recommendation that merchants needed a grounding in all three ancient languages (as well as "High Dutch") in The Tryall of Travell (1630), cited in Wright, Middle-Class Culture, 357. Despite the link between the Merchant Taylors School and the College of St. John at Oxford (see Charlton, Education in Renaissance</page><page sequence="20">20 BOOK HISTORY England, 131 on the places reserved there for the school's graduates), Misselden's name does not appear in the Alumni Oronienses ... 1500-1714. 57.

Discussing the correct relationship between donation, permutation, buying, selling, and lending of money. 60. The term "Scholastic" has often been applied to the economic theories in Malynes's works and in Misselden's first book as a shorthand for their most frequently cited sources. "Aristotelian" might be a better term for their philosophical thought per se, but it cannot be denied that the economic discourse of the century was still heavily dependent on the work of Aquinas and Scotus. A good summary of this can be found in Jacob Viner, "Religious Thought and Economic Society: Four Chapters from an Unfinished Work by Jacob Viner," ed. Jacques Melitz and Donald Winch, History of Political Economy 10, no.1 (Spring 1978): 1-192. A discussion of the ways in which Malynes both adhered to and moved away from Scholastic economic thought can be found in Roover, "Malynes," 350-58. Roover considered Malynes a transitional figure between Scholasticism and mercantilism. 61. On the support for a trilingual education among both Protestants and Catholic human- ists as necessary for religious reasons, see, for example, Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England, 84-85, 129. 62. Misselden, Circle of Commerce, unpaged dedication to Middlesex, with marginal no- tations to Epitaphium Iotti in Peacham, cap. 12. For which, see Henry Peacham, Peacham's Compleat Gentleman (London: J. Legat for F. Constable,1634), ed. G. S. Gordon (Oxford: Clarendon, 1906), 118. The marginal notation for the "quadrature" is Peter Ramus's Geome- try, lib. 4. 63. Giving us the versions of Hesiod, Anaximines, Thales, Hippasius Metaphontinus, and the Pythagoreans from assorted sources. 64. The system Misselden favored can best be described as oligopoly. His definition of a monopoly in the strict sense (of which he disapproved) was taken from that of Johannes Al- thusius, Politica methodice, cap. 31-32; for which, see FT 57-58. 65. Citing Cicero, De Officiis I.1, and Peter Ramus, Dialecticae Institutiones (1543) 32.33, on the link between "Testimony" and "Authority." Misselden's concession to his public's lack of learning was to render Hebrew sources into Greek and Latin and English, Greek sources into Latin and English, and Latin sources into English, subjecting those who could read the original to multiple repetitions of the same point-although he himself complained of the time wasted by "double" translations (CC 46). Misselden's defense forms an ironic counterpoint to the public disdain for "unlearned authors" and readers requiring translations so prominent only a decade or two before (and not yet vanished from the scene in 1622). On this, see Wright, Middle-Class Culture, 93-95. 66. The poem, quoted in full by Misselden, although not named, appeared in the 1615 edition of Joseph Scaliger's Poemata. For a future member of Archbishop Laud's party, Missel- den was exceedingly fond of nonconforming sources. 67. James I, Basilikon Doron in Political Works, 26. 68.
