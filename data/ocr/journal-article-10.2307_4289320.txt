Against All Cruelty: the Humanitarian League, 1891-1919 by Dan Weinbren The Humanitarian League was a London-based radical pressure group which espoused 'humane principles on a rational basis'. It existed between 1891 and 1919 as part of a broader movement promoting alternatives to industrial progress, economic liberalism and hell-fire Protestantism. The League aimed to bolster links between radicals and to pioneer a 'well- defined and unmistakeable standard of humaneness' through legislative changes which would aid the cultivation of people's innate sympathy rather than encourage selfish individualism.' It opposed vivisection, compulsory vaccination and the trade in, ill-treatment or killing of animals. Members also campaigned for Poor Law and Criminal Law reform, for the public control of a number of trades and institutions, for arbitration as a means of resolving international disputes and for greater public access to the countryside.2 League members were frequently and have continued to be marginalized as cranks of limited significance.3 There has however been some recognition of the significance of certain League activists: the first systematic guide to animal rights literature, published ninety-nine years after the League was formed, is dedicated to the League's founder, Henry Salt; and ainother recent work has suggested that today's debate about the moral status of animals 'would have bemused the Victorians, with the exception, perhaps of Henry Salt'. Nevertheless, assessments have gener- ally ignored the broad perspective of the League and have thus broken the links that it sought to strengthen.4 It is difficult to measure the full extent to History Workshop Journal Issue 38 ?)

League campaigns led to legislation to ban miniature zoos in London and some hunting and flogging; and the League also influenced legislation on Prisons (1898), on Criminal Justice and Criminal Appeals (1912) and on Plumage (1921). Its activities led to changes within the Howard Association and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and it inspired the environmental movement.6 The League is also of interest not only because of its achievements but because its rise and fall are an exemplar of the fate of liberal England during its crisis. Part I of this essay sketches the foundation of the League and the basis of its ideas, which were reactions to Darwin and to mid-century Christian orthodoxy. Part II is an outline of the League's structure, and Part III an analysis of the ways in which the League, in order to promote the broad goal of Humanitarianism, worked within conventional perimeters, by lobbying the influential for specific changes and highlighting individual cases and individual solutions to the general social malaise that it dis- cerned. I The League was established by the socialist Henry Stephens Salt (1851- 1939). Salt admired Howard Williams' The Ethics of Diet (1883), a biographical history of the literature of humane dietetics, in which the formation of a 'humane society with a wider scope than any previously existing body' was proposed. Salt developed his ideas in an article, 'Humanitarianism', published in the Westminster Review in 1889, and in a paper presented to his fellow Fabians.7 Deciding that 'Humaneness found little place in the Fabian philosophy', with prominent socialists and vegetarians Williams, Edward Maitland, Ernest Bell, Kenneth Romanes and Alice Lewis, he formed the Humanitarian League.8 Salt remained Honorary Secretary and Lewis Treasurer for the entire existence of the League. League members were united by their questioning of ideas which had till recently been certainties. They included journalists, novelists, members of the Independent Labour Party, the Vegetarian Society, the Church Socialist League, the National Secular Society, and the Society for the Abolition of Capital Punishment, and supporters of a number of other radical causes. What they shared was an interest in the development of broad-based, democratic political alternatives to the dominance of laissez- faire and of the weak by the strong. The League's programme drew in those who wanted to change people's behaviour. It included those who wanted to improve individuals, those who wanted state intervention in the name of</page><page sequence="4">Against All Cruelty 89 collective good against the market and those who wanted to use the state to resolve the crises affecting civil society. The League grew into a flexible network of groups with diverse foci but core values. It shared with New Liberalism a belief in the value of the constitution and a desire to transform the liberal state, from above, into a more collectivist regime. It had a radical vision and a practical agenda which emphasized both collective, state-instituted reforms designed to help realize the potential of individuals, and individual self-improvement. The League aimed at a new form of liberalism, where instead of power being legitimated in contractual terms, with the state enforcing contracts between sane adult men, the state was legitimated in terms of its ability to oppose cruelty. New social identities would be established as 'Greater Kinship' developed: 'the scope of humane feeling will gradually be expanded', possibly towards disgust not just at torture but at the 'wanton destruction of any beautiful scene - the destruction of a growing tree or the pollution of a clear river'.9 The basis of the creed was that instinctive compassion, if guided by reason, could be the basis of a state which would intervene to educate, regulate and legislate. The League proposed to bridge the gaps between disparate forces within society, to neutralize differences by partially recasting, and thus partly preserving, the liberal tradition. Organizing society to promote compassion would be natural, rational, and economically viable, and would benefit both victims and perpetrators of violence. Central to the League was a distinctive reading of Darwin. Marx and Engels had adopted Darwinism as the biological counterpart to the class war, they wanted to dedicate the English edition of Capital to Darwin; Herbert Spencer used Darwin as scientific justification for his ideas about the 'survival of the fittest'; New Liberals employed ideas derived from Darwin in order to render their classification and regulation of the poor and the unfit as scientific.10 Between Marx and Spencer were League members, interested in biological unity, not racial difference, in the state as efficient arbiter of a balanced, regulated society, allocating functions and redistri- buting wealth. The League vision of citizenship was derived from Darwin, but was broader than the liberal version. It was of a rational, ethical, new order based upon 'Greater Kinship'. Darwin wrote in his notebook, 'Animals may partake from our common origin in one ancestor. . . we may all be netted together'. When Humanity set out to refute 'certain fallacies' the first of which was 'nature red in tooth and claw', it cited Darwin as evidence that nature was not heartlessly always at war.1" League member Alfred Russel Wallace's paper proposing the theory of evolution by natural selection was read to the Linnean Society in 1858, together with Darwin's paper 'On the Origin of species by . . . natural selection'. Wallace argued that competition had failed society, that life did not evolve through combat, and that a just, rational, co-operative vegetarian society where women could choose their work and were financially independent of men would ensure the improvement of the human race.12 Salt adapted the theme:</page><page sequence="5">90 History Workshop Journal humanity and science between them have exploded the idea of a hard-and-fast line between white . .. and black . .. rich and poor ... educated and uneducated . . . 'good' . . . and 'bad'. Equally impossible to maintain in the light of newer knowledge, is the idea that there is a difference in kind and not in degree only between human and non-human intelligence.'3 League member Robert Blatchford held that it was now scientifically proven that altruism was 'better than selfishness'. " William Jupp, the author of Religion of nature and human experience (1906), argued that 'What Wordsworth felt concerning the relations of Man to Nature, Darwin proved to have a reasonable basis in fact' "15 Thomas Hardy thought that Darwin had revealed that all organic creatures were linked and had thus undermined the defence of vivisection and 'shifted the centre of altruism to the whole world collectively'.16 Professor Lawson Tait, an antivivisectionist doctor, wrote: Admitting that so-called lower animals are part of ourselves, in being of one scheme and differing from us only in degree, no matter how they be considered, is to admit that they have equal rights.'7 Whereas New Liberals argued that the state had moral functions and, as the embodiment of reason, had to intervene to preserve liberty and to aid efficiency, the League wanted a state which would cultivate better citizens and promote the simple life based on a notion of unity with all sentient beings. League publications repeatedly insisted that there was an 'innate instinct of compassion', 'an instinctive justice and mercy', and that it was important to trust 'to the merciful character which enters into every character by nature'. The League argued that civilization was a disease caused by private property. Humanitarian ideas could best be integrated into society through the increase in humanely exercised public control, and by people living more naturally. Health was a 'positive force' within everybody and disease 'a failure to learn or obey the laws of the inner being'.18 Edward Aveling's proposal for the League's name, the 'New Savages', Salt's autobiography about life in England, Seventy years among savages (1921), and Carpenter's Civilisation: its cause and cure (1889) all reflect this notion of original purity tainted by modern society.19 Vivisection had become acceptable within society principally because of the 'deterioration of character and perception induced by a diet to which man is not naturally adapted'. 'Redemption' required 'the love and the will to accomplish' a change in diet.20 The League called vivisection 'the logical outcome and last expression of the scientific materialism of the day' and held that vivisectors had renounced morality and did not understand the oneness of nature, the 'purity of blood', and the abhorrent character of inoculation by means of 'animal poison'.21 A vivisector, by the nature of his work, 'draws a fresh veil between himself and</page><page sequence="6">Against All Cruelty 91 the source of all life and light'. To ignore the plight of animals was 'to destroy the consciousness of self, the everlasting soul, the knowledge of which before all things and alone gave true health and freedom from disease'." Healthy unification and reintegration could occur through a return to nature.23 However mercy was not the only instinct. Salt recognized that 'big game hunting' was 'doubtless an exciting pastime' and another League author, R.H. Jude, equated tiger hunting with manliness. Salt went on to ask: what of that other tiger that lurks in the heart of us and how is he going to be eliminated, so long as a savage lust for killing is a recognised form of amusement?24 The League wanted regulation of instincts in order to counter 'indifferen- tism in society' and 'partial and short-sighted philanthropy'. It wanted to promote rational Humanitarianism as political and constructive, 'not merely a kindly sentiment, product of the heart rather than the head'.25 The employment of scientific evidence as the basis for a moral system, the idea that human feelings were rational, natural and had a lengthy history outside Christianity, was further bolstered by the decline in interest in Christian orthodoxy. The League was developed by people who rejected the notions of simple salvation and God's infallible word and who replaced them with liberal religion, a doctrine of love, or agnosticism. Robert Blatchford argued that the need was not 'to divide men into good and evil' as Christians did, but to change the environment.26 By the late nineteenth century to deny hell or to question the need for a personal experience of God was no longer widely perceived as amoral and subversive. The League reflects a sense of optimism about human capacity, a broader conception of the sacred. Scepticism replaced fear as to the everlasting burning of non-Christians. Darwin and geologists were cited as evidence in contradiction to Biblical literalism. The League did not reject spiritual terms (Edward Carpenter wrote that he 'saw deep in the eyes of the animals, the human soul look up at me'), but it placed them alongside arguments that it was natural and rational to oppose all cruelty.27 At the same time as Christian religious orthodoxy 'disintegrated in the later [18]'70s and '80s and more obviously in the '90s and thereafter, and a variety of religious positions acquired social acceptability', political ideas too were being reconstructed.28 The League proposed a route out of the chaos, a new politics of self-improvement and social reform based upon a natural, secular, code of kindness towards nature and all life. II In line with the shifts in Christian morality, the League's structure emphasized self-development, not self-restraint, reflecting the belief,</page><page sequence="7">92 History Workshop Journal expressed in the League's first publication, that 'morality is progressive' and could be expanded if compassion was allowed free growth.29 There were four quasi-autonomous departments: one dealt with Criminal Law and Prison Reform; another with Humane Diet (joined from 1897, by Dress); and there were others for Lectures for Children and Sports. Each department had an executive committee and a treasurer. In 1908 the four departments were consolidated into two; Criminal Law and Prison Reform and another one called Animals' Defence. In addition, in 1898, an Indian Humanitarian Committee was formed and there was also a Ladies' Committee and an Entertainment Committee. Branches were established in Glasgow, Manchester, Croydon, Letchworth and Bombay from 1909. The League's federal structure allowed League supporters to emphasize varying aspects of Humanitarianism. One member, Fitzroy Stewart, who was also Secretary to the Conservative Central Office, favoured the abolition of bloodsports but not of flogging; another member challenged Salt to a duel over birching, which Salt opposed, but supported the League's protests over the feeding of live prey to snakes at London Zoo.30 In the League's Corporal Punishment in India: Whipping and Morality in Gaols it is proposed that flogging be maintained as a punishment for 'gross outrages committed by a gang of men in concert' and a League author on prison reform said that he was uninterested in opposition to cruel sports and vivisection.3" The League's opposition to rabbit coursing was couched in traditional terms, 'We beseech you in the name alike of your country, your manhood and your religion to give over this vile amusement', whereas much other League material rejected orthodox notions of masculinity and Christianity.32 Within each department there was an eclectic mix of approaches. League authors included a judge, the Recorder of Liverpool, MPs, authors on prison reform and offenders, such as Robert Johnson who wrote 'I was in Prison': a plea for the amelioration of the criminal law (1893), and a suffragette who described her time in Holloway in the Humane Review.33 The structure meant that the committee of Our Dumb Friends League could give five guineas to the League specifically for animal welfare work; and that novelist George Meredith could join, as he agreed with the campaign against spring traps for rabbits and bloodsports, if not with all the League's positions.34 Although Salt has tended to be seen as pivotal, there were others who were prominent in specific campaigns.35 In the case of bloodsports although Salt was involved - he campaigned against beagling - it was Killing for Sport (1914), a collection of essays by Carpenter and others with a foreword by G.B. Shaw, which received most publicity. Another League member, publisher and writer Ernest Bell, with the support of Carpenter, Shaw and Salt, was central to the establishment of the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports in 1924. In 1932 Bell founded the National Society for the Abolition of Cruel Sports. Similarly it was W.D. Morrison who was central to the prison work of the League and it was Arthur St John and Carl Heath,</page><page sequence="8">Against All Cruelty 93 not Salt, who went on to form the Prison Reform League which later revitalized the Howard Association. The monthly Humanity (subsequently renamed the Humanitarian), was launched in 1895. It was edited by Salt. He also edited the quarterly Humane Review, available from 1900, and two spoofs: the Brutalarian: a journal for the sane and strong (one edition 1904) and Beagler Boy (two editions, 1907) which appealed for help 'to save a gallant school sport from extinction'. However others wrote the numerous pamphlets; and the Prison Record (four editions 1900-01) was edited by Collinson. Mr and Mrs Atherton Curtis funded the journals. There was no strict central authority over the content of pamphlets. Different emphases were to be found in, for example, the publications about the low-paid written by a Fabian, a Liberal and a member of the Independent Labour Party. In Industrial Women and how to Help them and Women's Wages and the Conditions under which they are earned (1893), Isabella Ford argued that 'when the working woman does awake and desire her true salvation she must, as all of us must, work it out for herself'. Ford opposed 'rescue work' and wanted instead to 'help awaken that desire for a true salvation' and to 'fill the minds of those we wish to emancipate with an intelligent discontent'.36 The 'full solution' to sweating lay in 'the growth of sympathy guided by reason . .. intelligently [to] organize the whole of life in accordance with Insight and Love'. Ford's 'remedy' for low wages lay in arousing women workers to see 'a better value in their own worth, their own infinite value'.37 In Dangerous Trades For Women (1893), written by Liberal Louise Mallet, the emphasis was on 'social responsibilities' and there was a plea for the Women's Liberal Association to help create 'a sound public opinion'.38 Altering society through education, even if this included teaching 'women to rebel not submit' as Isabella Ford advocated, was necessarily a long-term project.39 In his The Sweated System (1896), Maurice Adams, a Fabian, proposed municipalization and nationalization of the industry in order to alleviate the plight of the workers. The federal structure of the League aided its promotion of unity. This was of significance during the 1890s, a period when the gap between 'the esoteric and the empirical wings of the movement' widened, when 'the Ethical impulse . . . moved out of the socialist movement'.4O In 1895 the League issued 'a plan for a federation of all advanced workers'. It saw connections between those interested in the 'simplification' of life and the liberalization of social and sexual relations, people who focussed upon a more sensitive approach to animals and those who emphasized the importance of electoral politics. Humanity argued in 1898 that as long as pecuniary profit was the guiding principle, 'it will remain impossible to secure a right treatment of animals [as] economic necessity leaves no scope for humaneness'. The League made it clear that 'the idea of profit precedes and transcends all ideas of kindness of humanity'. Where a cabman who flogged his horse was prosecuted he was 'often overdriven himself by his employer and though this does not justify his conduct it largely accounts for it'. The League called</page><page sequence="9">94 History Workshop Journal upon 'Labour' to 'defend animals against the horrible exploitation of so-called science' and it argued that vivisection was due to 'irresponsible '41 money power'. The League held joint meetings with other groups and promoted their activities. A joint committee of women was established with the Romilly Society, which was founded by League member C.H. Hopwood, to campaign for the liberalization of the law on infanticide.42 The League held a meeting on the Sweated Trades in conjunction with the Fellowship of New Life. It campaigned, successfully, with the medical journal, the Lancet, as well as with the Prison Reform League and the State Children's Association (both of which had close associations with the League), for the removal of the flogging clauses from the Youthful Offenders Act (1900). The 1904 Annual Report of the Prison Reform League in the Humanitarian and League material was reprinted in the theosophical journal, the Herald of the Star.43 In 1895 it instituted an annual National Humanitarian Conference, an event which survived the demise of the League by at least a year. In 1919 it was organized by the League of Peace and Freedom and the speakers, Louise Lind-af-Hageby, Isabella Ford and Charlotte Despard, were all League members.44 The League also pointed to the connections between different campaigns. It was argued that 'woman is par excellence [above all] the sweated one' and that opposition to sweated labour was 'quite as much in the cause of animals as it is in the cause of men'.45 Howard Williams called flogging 'torture' and vivisection 'experimental torture'. Salt proposed that 'the twin tyrannies of flogging and vivisection should be linked together ... for they are indeed linked expressions of one barbarous spirit'.46 By 1919 the League felt that it had co-ordinated progressives; 'We think we may congratulate ourselves on having brought social reformers and zoophilists [animal lovers] into line'.47 The League was not indiscriminate in its choice of allies. It sought alliances 'with kindred spirits that are in tendency, progressive'.48 Isabella Ford was both chair of the Leeds branch of the RSPCA and on the executive committee of the League.49 However the League disapproved of the RSPCA's President, the Duke of York, when he went stag-hunting and on another occasion the League enquired, 'What has become of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that it never seems to have made a persistent stand against this barbarity in high places?'50 It also asked 'Where is the Howard Association?' and concluded that it was 'no longer progress- ive but a reactionary . .. dead weight'.51 The Association, which boasted of its connections with the Home Secretary, had become 'tame' and 'a parasite of the old system'.52 The League objected to women being categorized as 'ministering angels' or 'womanly women', if these terms were used as a means of denying women the vote. It campaigned for the release of hunger-striking suffrage campaigners and opposed the 'barbarous and repugnant' practice of forcible feeding.53 However one edition of the League's Prison Record was devoted to refuting the arguments made by</page><page sequence="10">Against All Cruelty 95 both Mrs Fenwick Miller, editor-owner of the Women's Signal, and the Edinburgh Women's Suffrage Society in support of flogging for certain crimes against women.54 The League disagreed and made the case that flogging men for offences against women was part of the so-called "'chivalrous" spirit which has for centuries done more than anything else to '55 keep women in subjugation under the guise of respect'. III The principal tactics of the League were lobbying the influential and informing the public. Despite the claim that it relied 'not upon names but upon arguments' and that it was 'a mere handful of workers with no funds at their disposal, no influential support, no special qualifications for their task', many League members did enjoy a degree of influence in society.56 Henry Salt was at Eton with the head of the prison service and introduced Galsworthy to him. Galsworthy then wrote a play, and a League pamphlet, which were critical of the legal system. Many League letters to government departments were drafted by W.H.S. Monck, a civil servant.57 It was the evidence of a League member, prison chaplain William Douglas Morrison, to the 1895 Home Office committee on the management, administration, classification and treatment of prisoners which paved the way to the reforming 1898 Prisons Act, once called 'the most considered statement of penal policy ever enunciated in the country'.58 R.B. Haldane, who sat on the committee, wrote to Morrison, I think that not only the Prison Committee but the whole English public are in your debt. You have been the real instrument in bringing about what I hope will be a very great change for the better.59 Others in the League stressed the value of arousing the consciences of the influential. I.M. Greg and S.H. Towers requested shareholders of com- panies engaged in shipping cattle to draw attention to this 'evil' trade.60 In regard to hunting, Lady Florence Dixie, an explorer, novelist and war correspondent, wrote: 'One wonders what our Hindoo sisters think of the Christian women of England and their participation in cruel, cold-blooded slaughter' and the Reverend Stratton, a former fox hunter, called upon 'Aristocratic ladies and gentlemen' to 'exercise self denial' as he did not want the 'lower classes to imitate the higher'.6' The 1890s was also a period identified by Beatrice Webb as one when there was a 'growing uneasiness ... a new consciousness of sin' amongst men 'of intellect and property'.62 The League appealed to, and was part of, that new consciousness. It argued not only that the promotion of compassion would benefit victims; but that violence adversely affected the perpetrator as well. Salt noted that 'the horror of the old naval and military lashings is within the memory of many officers who were compelled to witness them'.63 He also argued that humane</page><page sequence="11">96 History Workshop Journal feelings towards animals 'form a natural tie which cannot be rudely broken without doing violence to many of the finer attitudes of our nature'.' The League sought to end capital and corporal punishment - hanging, flogging, the treadmill and oakum picking - as these brutalized both the punished and those meting out the punishment.65 In his poem The Hymn of the Flagellomaniacs Salt expanded on these ideas. He suggested that floggers had a 'fevered yearning/for the bare and bleeding back'.66 On another occasion Hopwood wrote that floggings 'brutalise and corrupt society'.67 The League defined its 'business' as being 'to educate public opinion and so pave the way for fuller and more advanced legislation'.68 It added that 'Bad as things are, it is only from the knowledge of their badness that we can hope for a means of reformation'. 69 The publications played inspirational, integrative and informative roles in the uniting of progressives and the promotion of Humanitarianism. The League also saw an important role for its lantern lectures for children, whilst the 1898 Annual Report argued that 'no more important work could be attempted than to visit the great public schools' and there was a League pamphlet and article by Salt: Litterae Humaniores: an appeal to teachers.70 The League encouraged letter writing and published an annual 'roll of honour' of the newspapers in which favourable coverage had appeared. It argued that through gaining a greater understanding of the social order people would come to appreciate common problems and solutions, rather than narrowing their focus.71 When both The Times and the Encyclopedia Britannica suggested that it was the introduc- tion of 'the cat', under the 1863 Garrotting Act, which had ended the garrotting epidemic of the previous year, the League's response, which pointed out that the garrotters had been gaoled before the introduction of the Act, was published in 300 newspapers.72 Immediately prior to the 1900 Flogging Bill the League organized a press campaign, petitions and a leaflet especially prepared for the House. The Bill was defeated. The League also campaigned successfully in 1906 to outlaw flogging in the Navy.73 Whatever the merits of a new moral order the League recognized the importance of the established framework of liberal economic values. In The Cruel Treatment of Fish Joseph Collinson argued that 'humane treatment would financially benefit the trader'.74 G.W. Foote in The Shadow of the Sword appealed to 'self interest which is eternal' as well as to humanity and reason, to put an end to wars.75 There was a need to treat problems 'from a more reasonable and scientific standpoint'. Prisons should be reformed not for sentimental reasons but 'from sound common-sense principles of economy, justice and mercy'.76 Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner in The Death Penalty (1905) argued that crime needed to be treated from 'a more reasonable and scientific standpoint . .. We need to probe for the causes of crime'. She thought criminals often were 'little more than mere straws driven on the wind of circumstance'. 7 The League argued that 'punishments may be necessary as a temporary expedient but they are perfectly futile in the long run'.78 It linked crime to social and economic deprivation: 'the vast</page><page sequence="12">Against All Cruelty 97 bulk of what is called crime is induced by extreme want and misery'.79 Edward Carpenter took up this point, suggesting of a woman who murdered her imbecile sister that both were victims of greed in factory and slum.80 The League used specific examples of injustice in order to draw attention to its wider concerns because it recognized that in the case of reforms 'progress is partial and intermittent and comes less as logic would expect than as feelings ordain'.81 It both campaigned for prison reform and publicized the fate of an individual convict shot on Dartmoor.82 Similarly it chose the state-owned Queen's Buckhounds as 'a very useful peg . . . on which to hang an exposure of the cruelty of staghunting'.83 In this sport, a de-horned, tame stag was released from a crate about three-quarters of a mile from the meet, chased and, if it was not injured, caught and re-crated. The Reverend J. Stratton (who brought to the League a quality which 'was at first somewhat deficient - the practical element which converts thought into action') led this campaign. It met with hostility: there was shooting at his house and he received abusive letters; but he continued to collect evidence of the cruelty involved in this 700-year tradition of hunting 'carted deer'. Petitions and deputations were organized, letters and pamphlets written and the support of the press enlisted. In 1901 the Buckhounds were abolished. Shortly afterwards the Admiralty withdrew financial support for the hounds of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and the RSPCA, which had not supported the League campaign, changed its policy. In 1910 it prosecuted Cambridge students for hunting carted deer. The campaign against bloodsports illustrates the ways in which the League pioneered a cause - it has been credited with initiating the anti-bloodsports movement - and its perception of legislative changes as important stepping stones on the route to a more humane world.84 Ernest Bell made this point whilst writing about vivisection: No invention will stop it. There are only two ways to do that. One is to forbid it absolutely by law under heavy penalty, the other is to create so strong a feeling against the cruelties and meanness which it involves that its advocates will be ashamed to carry it on.85 The campaign to stop the trade in feathers built upon the work and ideas of other organizations and employed a diversity of arguments within the League's conceptual framework of a post-Darwinian, socialistic morality, which it referred to as a 'branch of ethical science'.86 In 1891, when the League was formed, wild birds were second only to domestic pets as the subject of bourgeois animal lovers' interest. There was a Plumage League, a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and thousands of women had taken the pledge not to wear feathers. The League employed arguments similar to those of these campaigners; bird song was melodious, birds were models of industry and tenacity, and the method of killing them was cruel. Birds were frequently represented allegorically by League members.</page><page sequence="13">98 History Workshop Journal Thomas Hardy compared a caged skylark to a 'caged man', and used the image of caged birds to represent caged people in Jude the Obscure; in Tess of the d'Urbervilles he also employed the image of a cage as a prison for animals when he denounced the use of performing dogs at fairs. His anger was directed against the cruelty of 'an unnatural life in a wired cell'. In a poem about a bird blinded to encourage it to sing he asked 'Who is divine? This bird'.87 Salt compared a fellow League member, the novelist W.H. Hudson, to a captive eagle and a real eagle to a prisoner. A League suffragette, describing her prison experiences, likened Holloway to a 'cruel aviary', where women were 'caged up'. 88 The anthropomorphism was maintained by Edmund Selous, a renowned bird watcher who opposed laboratory-based work and treated birds as individuals with distinct states of mind. He initiated the idea that birds, like people, had 'courtship' habits.89 On the issue of the feathers trade, the League published an account, similar in tone to campaign pieces published by other organizations, of a return trip by the author to a herons' nesting ground in Florida. Where there had been 'several hundred' birds before, by 1897 there were only 'shattered nests. . . crumbling bones .. . the screaming of young birds and the buzzing of green flies'. The writer focussed on an individual victim of the killers and described the 'awful picture of pain'.90 Analyzing changes in attitudes in late Victorian society James Turner argues that people sympathized with the suffering of an individual, that: 'among the devils haunting the Victorians ... pain was an archdemon'.91 He suggests that this was a recent development, due in part to the fact that although the world was now explicable in terms of science and statistics and much of the natural world could be controlled, pain was less well understood or prevented. Certainly the League, for Salt, was part of a revolt against 'the monstrous fiction of an eternal hell' and 'the religion of the torture chamber'. He noted that Buddhists speak of Christendom as 'the hell of animals'; and a League pamphlet by R.H. Jude referred to Christianity as hypocritical for condemn- ing the occasional cigar whilst ignoring the 'sheer evil' of harming living creatures.92 League members tended to emphasize the importance of the light within and mercy, not an external, wrathful deity. From that viewpoint earthly pain was not insignificant in comparison to that which lay beyond death, and indeed to inflict unnecessary pain was to blaspheme in the face of a merciful God. Furthermore it was pain which reinforced the opposite of that sympathy, the fear of the beast within. Inflicting pain turned human animals into that from which they had descended, beasts. Humanitarian compassion for animals, our cousins, showed the basic, natural character of the world.93 While animal protectors sought to save every life, conservationists wished to safeguard endangered species, thus partially going against Darwinian notions of natural selection. The League used both arguments. It also suggested that the 'ruthless destruction' of birds would have dangerous repercussions for people. Owls, whose barred wings were popularly used as</page><page sequence="14">Against All Cruelty 99 hat decorations, were 'valuable to agriculture'. Moreover 'the wholesale slaughter of birds daily flung before the Juggernaut wheel of greed and vanity', had an adverse effect on human spirituality. The League drew together the arguments in order to make the case that birds merited protection because they appeared to be individually pretty and hard working; because the destruction of a species would have harmful side effects for people; and because they were 'feathered fellow-workers'.94 The League's view of animals informed its campaigns against both vivisection and compulsory vaccination. As there were vigorous campaigns in these fields well before the League was formed it did not make these concerns central but aimed rather 'to supplement such efforts as have already been organised for similar objects'.95 The 1871 Vaccination Act enabled non-medical vaccination officers to fine or imprison those parents who did not allow their children to be inoculated against smallpox. The law aroused sustained opposition and the legislation of 1898 and 1907 substan- tially acceded to anti-vaccinationist demands. The Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, followed lobbying by anti-vivisectionists. It provided regulation of vivisection, but the restrictions imposed could be overcome by means of certificates issued by the Home Office. The League focussed on the use of animals in experiments - they were too much like humans - and on the use of a vaccine made from calf lymph - the animalization of humans. It contributed a fresh theoretical perspective to the campaigns in that it elevated the notions of state intervention, education and a wholesome lifestyle. In addition it claimed responsibility for 'the more democratic element that has lately been introduced into the crusade against vivisec- tion' 96 Vaccination and experiments on live animals threatened natural purity and maintained the importance of scientific solutions. There was the 'very real and serious danger' of specialists gaining power, whereas 'the lay point of view is the only one to be considered. There cannot be any rational discussion of the professional point of view'. The most important reform of all was to be 'the humanising of medical education'. 97 Medical education was very much apart from philanthropy 'whereas it ought to be inseparable and indistinguishable from it'.98 The League also proposed the nationalization of the water supply, demanded 'better food and better homes' and argued in the case of epidemics that 'the evil is more social than individual'.99 It supported the provision, by the Maternity Society of England, of accommo- dation where women could get vegetarian food and know that there was no vivisection on the premises, and the work of League activist, and secretary of the international Vegetarian Federal Union, Josiah Oldfield, who ran the Humane Cottage Hospital and who later became senior physician at the Lady Margaret Fruitarian Hospital, Bromley. However for the League the 'general rule' in regard to hospitals was to 'agitate for public ones'.10' A hospital controlled by a county council hospital board could encourage a search for wisdom rather than knowledge, and unite philanthropy and</page><page sequence="15">100 History Workshop Journal education.101 It would also have a considerable educational influence on patients: 'rich and poor, educated and uneducated, idler and worker, mixing together for once on terms of equality'. Charity wards put patients at risk of mistreatment and experimentation but their replacement by state ownership in itself was not considered sufficient; it had to be humanitarian ownership. In 1919 the League argued that the proposed Ministry of Health would mean 'a large extension of medical tyranny and of experimental torture of animals other than man'.102 By that time, however, not only had state welfare provision not turned out as had been envisaged but the basis of support for the League had crumbled. Founded at a moment of what Carpenter called 'the great reaction [away] from the smug commercialism and materialism of the mid-Victorian epoch', as that diffuse reaction splintered and died away, the League failed to maintain momentum. 103 The development of garden cities, suburbs, bicycles, and cheaper rail travel all diminished the dichotomy between the countryside and the city, improved access to the countryside and blurred the vision of simple rustic harmony. The League gained support at the moment that the ILP 'completed its suicide' and there was considerable interest in a new vision; it lost it when Labour gained representation in the government and was coming to resemble a character in Salt's poem, 'The Song of the Respectables': Now wide awake, he treads on firmer ground, Shuns visionary dreams and hopes ecstatic; His views grow shrewd and sensible, and sound, And Social Democratic." The League promoted comprehensive, radical, 'humane principles of com- passion, love, gentleness and universal benevolence'.105 It was sufficiently attuned to conventional morality to be able to make successful legal inter- ventions and to propose specific socialistic legislation, some of which was later enacted. It provided a home for those who were disenchanted with the ideas which E.P. Thompson dubbed the 'dominant ideology' of industrializ- ation (Methodism and Utilitarianism), who wished to explore other ideas and who wanted to engage in promoting the 'creed of kinship' .106 During the First World War the membership and the publications of the League fell in number. It survived the Armistice, recognized 'our cause is now in a worse plight than ever before' and folded when most of the executive resigned.107 Although it failed to unite the many disparate manifestations of the 'late- Victorian revolt' it was responsible for some significant, innovative changes and it had a clear vision of the 'coming creed [as] likely to be none other than a religion of humanity - humanity in no narrower sense than compassion, love, justice for every living creature'.108</page><page sequence="16">Against All Cruelty 101 GUIDE TO REFERENCES AND ABBREVIATIONS Many Humanitarian League publications are held at the British Library of Economic and Political Science.

The League recom- mended the Co-operative Typewriters Company, founded to improve the status of female typists and shorthand writers, 'Fair Houses' for printing, Salvation Army matches which were made with harmless red phosphorus and the Letchworth Iceni Pottery, where the white lead formula was barred as it was injurious to the workforce. Humanity, May 1897; Humanity, July 1899 and Humanitarian, July 1910. See also L.J. Lowell, 'After the match strike: Bryant and May in the 1890s', Victorian Studies 25, Autumn 1982 and Jan Marsh, Back to the Land: the Pastoral Impulse in England from 1880-1914, 1983, pp. 227-8. 3 Mrs Ormiston Chant, of the Sporting League, an organization established to oppose the Humanitarian League, spoke disparagingly of 'these faddists . . . of the Humanitarian League' (quoted by Gareth Stedman Jones, 'Working class culture and working class politics in London 1870-1900: notes on the remaking of a working class', Journal of Social History 7: 4, Summer 1974, p. 496). S. Hay ('The Making of a late Victorian Hindu: M.K. Gandhi in London, 1888-1891', Victorian Studies 33, Autumn 1989, p. 81) called League members 'some of London's most eccentric idealists'. Josiah Oldfield said that the proudest day of his life was when the British Medical Association called him a 'scientific dietist' instead of a faddist (Streatham News, Balham News and Tooting News and Borough of Wandsworth Chronicle, 21 March 1919). Salt too was concerned about being labelled a crank, and countered the accu- sation in his Company, pp. 162-63, though he also wrote the self-deprecatingly titled Conso- lations of a Faddist, 1906. For H.M. Hyndman he was a 'crank' (Stephen Winsten, Salt and his Circle, 1951, p. 64); the Daily Telegraph (20 April 1939) called him 'the most thoroughgoing faddist in Britain'. More recently, Stanley Pierson (Marxism and the Origins of British Social- ism, Cornell, 1973, p. 183) called him 'a faddist'; Alan Haynes ('Murderous Millinery', History Today 33, July 1983, p. 28) 'a sentimental crank'; and L. Stevenson (The Ordeal of George Meredith: a Biography, New York, 1953, p. 348) one of a number of 'assorted cranks'. The label of 'crank' has been undermined by Chris Shaw who demonstrates that Salt and Carpenter shared a 'systematic idealist philosophy' (C.E. Shaw, 'Identified with the One: Edward Car- penter, Henry Salt and the Ethical Socialist Philosophy of Science', Prose Studies, history, theory, criticism 13: 1, 1990, p. 33, p. 46). 4 Charles R.

There is no evidence of Jewish members, although the Jewish method of slaughtering was condemned in Rev.

On the relationship between humanizing animals and de- animalizing of humans see Twigg, 'Vegetarian Movement', pp.202-3. J.
