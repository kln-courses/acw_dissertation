<plain_text><page sequence="1">I kernoi circolari in Oriente e in Occidente: Stru- menti di culto e immagini cosmiche, by Andrea M. Bignasca. Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis, Series Archaeologica 19. Freiburg, Switzerland: Universi- tatsverlag; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2000. XII + 258 pp., 36 plates, 12 tables, 4 maps. Cloth. SFr. 110.00/DM 132.00. Hollow, ring-shaped, horizontal, ceramic vessels topped by figural attachments have come to be known as ring kernoi. Andrea Bignasca's exhaustive study of the shape includes over 400 fourth- to first-millennium ex- amples from Iran, Sardinia, and all places in between. The interpretation of the pieces in cult as models of the cos- mos is buried in the third and fourth chapters, something that detracts from the initial reading of the volume. That this book comes directly from Bignasca's 1999 disserta- tion probably accounts for the lack of a more discursive introduction that would round out the text. Nonetheless, readers who are keen to learn more about ring kernoi, broad-ranging cultural interconnections from the Near East to the western Mediterranean, and intriguing ideas about artistic representations of ancient cosmic geography will find this volume a useful research tool and worth the read. To become easily familiar with the range of material considered in this study, the reader should begin with a review of tables 11 and 12, which summarize the range of contexts and symbols associated with ring kernoi. A read- through of definitions in chapter 1, followed by the larger implications of the study in chapter 4, clarifies a subse- quent reading of the wealth of detail in chapters 2 and 3. In formal scope this work is impressive and even con- vincing, but the specific causal connections behind the geographical spread and chronological continuity of the ring kernos as a cultic cosmological model remain to be demonstrated. The volume has six sections, the sixth containing an English summary and supporting documentation. The first chapter, an introduction, is largely technical, explaining the term "kernos" and justifying the chronological and geographical limits of the study. Here Bignasca notes, as have others previously, that the term kernos for the vessels of this study is technically incorrect, the ring kernos having more functional associations with rhyta and, to a</page><page sequence="2">2002 BOOK REVIEWS 93 lesser extent, askoi than to the Classical-period vessels at Eleusis to which the term kernos refers. A useful general discussion of vases that incorporates multiple small ves- sels clarifies the distinctive grouping of the horizontal ring-shaped vessels, to which the term "ring kernoi" con- tinues to refer in this volume. The study ends with sixth- century B.C. material because after that time these vessels no longer appear in the east, and the standardization of later vessels in Greece and Italy is something the author thinks takes the subject in a slightly different direction. Chapter 2, which takes up most of the volume, consists of discussions of ring kernoi, arranged geographically and chronologically. Objects from the four main geographical regions in the study are coded to make their general origin clear: O for the Orient, C for Cyprus, E (Elladico) for Greece and the Aegean islands, and W (western) for the Occident. Within their region, the objects are numbered from Arabic numeral one. This system relates directly to the structure of chapter 5, the catalog, making cross- reading among chapters quick and easy. The catalog itself is easy to use. Asterisks mark pieces that have illustra- tions in the volume, all of which are three-dimensionally rendered line drawings rather than photographs. Some in- clude cross-sections of the vessels. Details about all ves- sels also appear in 12 tables that highlight geographical, contextual, and formal patterns. Both the Orient and Occident groupings are broad, but for the sake of classification, the system works. For each of the four regions, the discussion in chapter 2 proceeds chronologically, from the Early Bronze Age through the sixth century B.C. It is here that the broad groupings of Orient and Occident (as opposed to Cypriote and Greek) are somewhat jarring. Is Iran, for example, best grouped with the southern Levant in the Iron Age, while Cyprus is a separate category? Of course Iranian material is distin- guished from Levantine in the discussion and the tables at the end of the volume go a long way toward highlighting narrower regional patterns (especially table 11). Also one can skip ahead, for example, from region to region to read only about the Late Bronze Age, if that is one's particular interest. A brief discussion of Classical and Hellenistic material follows the finds from the western Mediterranean as a preview of a later article on the subject. At the end of each regional discussion is a summary. These are particularly useful, for it is here that one can see easily the range of funerary, sanctuary, and secular contexts from which the ring kernoi come. The almost total lack of nonfunerary contexts on Cyprus compared with other regions in the study is not surprising, given the small number of nonfunerary contexts for some periods on the island. Thus, this apparent difference in context of use from other places should not be given too much importance. Chapter 3 discusses structural and iconographical ele- ments, going into detail about the vessels, bulls, caprids, rams, birds, serpents, lions, frogs, and monkeys, as well as anthropomorphic figures, pomegranates, shells, and even astragali that appear as plastically rendered figures on top of the hollow rings. Particularly striking is that not all the attached figural pieces communicate via a hole with the hollow rings. Nor are all the rings hollow. Considering the form and iconography of the pieces, Bignasca dis- cusses in detail the potential significance of the individual features, such as the bull for fertility, and the ring shape as a representation of the cosmic waters, citing a parallel with the Babylonian clay tablet map of the cosmos from Sippar. The contextual association of specific vessel forms, plants, and animals on individual ring kernoi is of particu- lar note. First, they compare with contemporary ceramic vessels and terracotta figures, thus making a formal link with other finds in the archaeological record. More im- portantly, they suggest symbols that were related in sys- tems of thought associated with cult activity in the ancient world, whether funerary, sanctuary-based, or otherwise. Individual artifacts in the ground, even if found in close association with one another, are always separate, and we must make the relational links among them. Although we have many images that link symbols in the ancient world, there are comparatively few that link a set of symbols to an image that may represent an ancient conception of spa- tial geography. It is this association that makes the ring kernoi remarkable as objects of study. Chapter 4, about general conclusions, elaborates on the functions of the ring kernoi. As containers for liquids, Bignasca argues that water, because of its association with the ocean, would have been most important for a model of the cosmos. The mixing of liquids, however, was also probably part of the vessels' function, so wine, oil, milk, etc. are also discussed. As cult objects, ring kernoi may have been related to negotiating or establishing order, es- pecially when life had been disrupted. If Bignasca is cor- rect that these were cosmic models, they would have been appropriate in all the contexts where they are found. Ne- gotiations of boundaries such as between life and death, humans and deities, as well as among past, present, and future, are all instances where such a model might have been in use. Although the general analogy with cosmic systems represented on the Babylonian tablet is interesting, what specific geographies might have been appropriate for the different regions of the study? Instead of a general spread- ing of ring kernoi from east to west over thousands of years, it would be helpful to have certain of the more tell- ing vessels and contexts highlighted to suggest how and why the broad patterns observed in this fine study might have occurred. The Late Bronze Age is one of particularly intensive and extensive ring kernos use. However, what is the specific difference or similarity between the use of these vessels, for example, on Cyprus or in the Aegean? What was the process for not only adopting the ring ker- nos, but for abandoning its use?</page><page sequence="3">94 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 328 Bignasca asserts that ring kernoi were used by the elite and that a general oriental perspective underlies the ves- sels and their use. However, do we see the transmission of form always at the same level of idea and function? Might there not be something more to say about why cer- tain kernoi and their associated images were appropri- ate not just on a general level, but for specific times and places? Bignasca's observation, for example, that the quantity of ring kernoi associated with the mass burial at Ashdod derives from an excessive need to reaffirm world order is a step in that direction. Now that the data is as- sembled, Bignasca has laid a firm foundation for further studies that may bring individual, ancient, and possibly cosmological views into focus. Joanna S.
