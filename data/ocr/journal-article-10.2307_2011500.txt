JUNE 10, 1909 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS THE COSMIC CHARACTER IN two earlier articles in this JOURNAL' the writer worked to grub out the roots of the pragmatic tree of knowledge. The tap- root he found to be a bare function, an universal activity, in its primal nature subpersonal and subconscious. In this paper I pre- sume to deal with the apparent disparity between this God, as blind, subvegetable, metaphysical first cause, and the cosmic character, the God alive, upon which religious experience seems to depend. I First of all we must disabuse our minds of the notion that the cosmic character is substantial. The function in which life, whether human or cosmic, has its primal cause is practically uni- versal and eternal; but only practically. The function is so long as life is; conscious activity (sum cogitans) is indubitable so long as the living doubt continues, but no longer. It is theoretically con- ceivable that all life, cosmic as well as human, should cease to be. In this catastrophic event the allegedly everlasting water-springs would have run dry, the tap-root of being would wither and dry up into nothing, the world-soul would flicker out in black death. But there is in all this no occasion for pausing. Tested prag- matically, death and nothing are unthinkable concepts. Reflection upon them could not further, but only retard life. Their sole reality consists in their devilish power to defeat at every point the lust of rationalism, the senseless passion for absolute certainty. Meanwhile I find no thinkable connection between this absolute cer- tainty and that practical certainty upon which active life depends. The cosmic function is indeed coneeivably perishable. But its decadence into death and nothing is practically unthinkable. Just because the cosmic life would in such an event flicker out into noth- ing, no one could possibly prepare his person for such a catastrophic end. The very last assumption with which our practical reason can get on is that of a functional activity, which, as active, is practically absolute and imperishable; and this no matter what disease, human 'Vol. IV., pp. 176-183, and Vol. VI., pp. 57-64. 309</page><page sequence="2">310 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY or cometary, may assault its universal life. Let one be purely humanitarian in his humanism after the manner of the positivists. Even so, he must assume that energy in one form or another of human activity is unassailable. This is the live nub of the school- man's insistenee upon an eternal as existent. There simply must be an a7repoy, he thinks-a That in its root impractical, but in its poten- tialities inexhaustible and practically absolute.2 There has got to be an universal energy on which the phenomenal life of God and of men may draw endlessly. Of course men and God may not have this limitless credit in the great vault beyond. There is a certain speculative risk in all life, for that is the condi- tion of life. Our lives, human and cosmic, depend upon taking the cash here and now and letting the credit go on so long as it will. It could only be after God and we were eternally dead and nothing, that the default of universal energy could reduce us to destitution and starvation; i. e., never so long as we know ourselves. In action the universal energy does function radically. It sloughs off dead parts from the cosmic organism and renews its withered members. The cosmic environment here and now is all on the side of health and perpetuity for those who are fit. And this is the first datum of the cosmic character: its inherent ability to pre- serve itself alive, its practical assumption that the energy within and without is everlastingly real and subject to all the drafts which can possibly be made upon it in the interest of life. II The implication of this first datum is that the cosmic character is an achievement. The universal energy must be drawn upow. In itself it is in the last degree impersonal, impractical, indifferent. The etymologists confirm this in their account of the verb of being. "To be" in its root-meaning is "to stand forth." The world- energy, I dare say, genuinely is only when it stands forth. The root-meaning of life is exclamatory, assertive, the will-to-power. I am: that I am. Too often cosmic life has been conceived as an energy which must needs function in the form of a phenomenal, universal life: its stand- ing forth is a necessary function of its eternal being. The Eternal thus unconsciously and without effort creates and maintains the best possible world: the world-soul does not actively draw upon, but is poured in upon, by the universal energy. But this postulate of willy- nilly creative energy goes against the grain of human experience. The fact is that the pouring-in process implies a certain suction on I Poincard says some clever things of this "something" as it stands in theoretical physics. See his " Science and Hypothesis," e. g., p. 166.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 311 the part of the living organism. The receiving of power from on high or from within implies a will-to-power. The first-class pessi- mists are wanting in this will; for them there is agony in the grow- ing-pains of life 's processes. They accordingly refuse to suckle themselves at the breast of being. They would sink back into the tireless, senseless That they set out from. It is not inherently impossible that one should in the end utterly dam the inlets of the universal energy. We must remark in this a second datum of the cosmic character. The will-to-power implies a will-to-impotence. This ingrained fea- ture of the human organism must be transcribed into the cosmic life as well. There is an energy circumpressing both within and without. Upon this the cosmic life draws at all times and places of its eventual life. The drawing-in process is not necessary, but optional. Merely to be, to stand forth, is in itself an unconscious symptom of health and character. For the universal life, like the human in its morbid moods, may genuinely prefer dissolution to further organization, death to life. The world-organism is thus an achievement. The tirelessness, persistency, and continuity of its being are symptomatic of a certain sanity, a congenital, tempera- mental healthy-mindedness in the living soul of things. There are cases, individual and racial, of apparently incurable insanity: the inlets of the universal life with its unconscious sanity seem hopelessly dammed up. Such evil is radical. Its cure, I imagine, can only be effected, if by any means, by a painful, con- scious operation within the universal life itself. Certainly in its case the unconscious remedial agency of the cosmic life has miserably failed. But in any event the existence here and there of diseased parts in the world-organism does not argue that the whole is incom- petent or likely to degenerate into the amorphous energy-the cosmic infancy it set out from. The evidence weighs heavily on the side of the general sanity of the cosmic life. A third datum of the cosmic character, therefore, is its animal efficiency and unconscious sanity. It achieves being, it draws upon the universal energy by a natural instinct-to-be. III In these prime data, however, the cosmic character is subcon- scious and subpersonal. So far, the cosmic life is strictly animal: it grows instinctively in the virgin womb of being. The human life is suckled, fortified and sanified within this cosmic animal.3 O3ne feels secure and willing to function naturally within cosmos's great organism. But I wonder if our cosmic emotion at this level is not really com- parable with the gratitude we might feel toward a great animal that has instinctively saved our own skin and bones from the grave?</page><page sequence="4">312 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY This, too, is religion of a certain type and its proper emotions are in a profound degree theophanic. Meanwhile it is arch-pessi- mism-a religion based upon the experience of personal life as a dis- ease of consciousness to be remedied by anesthesis and analgesis, a return to the subconscious organism of which personal feeling-will is but an inflamed member. Cosmiic character, so the argument goes, is only weakened and diseased by these germs of personality. The writer agrees that a person is an inflammation of cosmic being. But this disease of personality is a condition in which alone such terms as "purpose," "value," ''worth,' ''morality,' gain genuine meaning. Religious pessimism has always aimed at so- called uqnconscious purpose, instinctive worth, animal morality. But really these are all contradictions in terms. They would reduce ends to unconscious, instinctive, animal functions, whereas the quintessential meaning of an end requires that it be consciously felt, aimed at, controlled; in a word, that it prepossess and be con- sciously acknowledged by some person. I grant that this condition is hard. Each fulfillment wherein a conscious purpose becomes a part of the organism's unconscious character is but the progenitor of another newly-felt purpose; and so on endlessly. But this consti- tutes conscious as distinguished from unconscious character. In personality there is an indispensable, endless challenge to unful- filled being, a "standing forth" which, on the one hand, will not permit the human life to sink back into the unconscious bliss of animal activity it has risen above, and which, on the other hand, can never raise that human life to a haven of supraconscious rest. Fichte found this inner anstoss a challenge for all time. Carlyle leapt under it as under a cosmic lash. Poor Nietzsche lost his sanity under the pressure of its ceaseless will-to-power. At all events, the cosmic life has in us taken on a conspicuous per- sonal character. In us its present ends are genuinely felt. In us its ends are unthinkable, endless, as the pessimists are everlastinglv reminding us; but they are none-the-less conscious imperatives. We may risk disease, lose the sanity of our pure reason in gaining the sanity of our practical, but if we turn back we are as salt which has lost its savor: we lose the very flavor and essence of character. In us, then, the blind character of the cosmic impulses has become endlessly conscious. Henceforth we must aim at being, we must control our ends even to the point where the abysmal possibilities of being blind us with a new kind of blinddness; the blindness of one whose pupils strain to take iD the invisible. "But this is positivism, pure and simple," some one will say. "This is human character, very good while it lasts! but it makes out no such case for the u'niversal life. It means merely that a cer-</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 313 tain animal has evolved into conscious self-possession. Man, so far, sports above his cosmic progenitor. Like positivism, your cosmic humanism is really an ungodding (Entgottung) of the universal life, a surreptitious deification of human being. Is God, then, merely a 'crowd-consciousness'?" To all this cosmic humanism must reply imperturbably: God, if not merely human, is at any rate essentially just that. Our human- ism has practically all its active interests in common with scientific positivism.4 In its description of the universal life there is no taint of magic religion nor of overleapng metaphysics. The world-ground as the incomparably fecund matrix of the present cosmos is in our view identical with the ether-strains of experimental physics. Cosmos is a system of countless straining relations, a complex of Energie-str6men. Psychophysically the cosmic character appears, so far, as an organism of vital activities risen to the level of animal subconsciousness. In us this cosmic animal has varied to the high level of personal consciousness. But then, the " eternal " of rationalism is an unnecessary hypoth- esis, if only human character be allowed cosmic application and sweep. If conscious aiming is now and practically universal in the cosmic life, to say that it has been eternally so adds nothing signifi- cant to the present facts and life of the world-soul. The fact is that the hypothesis of an eternal, infinite character unconsciously seeks to remedy the one glaring defect in positivism; namely, its inveter- ate thinking of man apart from cosmos. But the human organism is continuous with the unthinkably limpid stuff of which the uni- versal life itself is a function. In a most important and literal sense the character of any part of the world-life is in its degree the character of the whole. The universal energy which all life draws upon is practically a perfect, limpid fluid. If I tap my desk here with my pen the world-ground is moved gelatinously throughout its whole being. Now, I permit in my person impulses of conscious purpose; these aims are like my pen-taps of a moment ago; whenever they hit the truth in the bull's-eye, they ring their reality into the whole cosmic life; and this by physical necessity, if you please. The cosmic life in us and through us has become in all its physical energies a personal animal. Should it turn back from the endless Person it now aims to become, should it seek to reduce or prevent the inflammation which in us brings it to conscious possession of all its own latent energies, it would surely degenerate into the blind, witless being it once was. An infinite appetite for personal being is thus a third datum of the cosmic character. 4I mean " scientific" as distinguished from the more passionate but shal- lower ethical positivism.</page><page sequence="6">314 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY IV Once we entertain the notion that the cosmic life is moved through and through by the birth of men within its being there remains only the task of ascribing to the cosmic character the ineradicable forms and passions of the human organism. For the religion of humanism will turn out to be in the highest degree anthro- pomorphic and anthropopathic in its experience of the divine life. As to the anthropomorphic character of the cosmic life. The cosmic physique obviously is free from the parts and organs we com- monly remark in the frames of animals; it has no systems, circula- tory, skeletal, urinogenital, and the like. It has not the blue eyes and fair hair of its Thracian idolator, nor the flat nose of the Ethiopian. It is as it were "all eye," "all ear," and "all thought." If it be physical at all, it would seem to have the quality of sensuous experi- ence without the visible end-organs thereof. Is, then, the cosmic life completely amorphous? This we can hardly say; for there is in fact a cosmic physique-planets, stars, earths, comets, all more or less harmoniously adjusted by this time into a systematic whole. Our thought of the cosmic life may thus in one point be psychophysical, and anthropomorphic. It is of course a figure to speak of the universal life as "all eye" and "all ear." Regarding its gross anatomy, one would be nearer the literal truth in thinking of the cosmic physique as all brain. The stellar universe, once more in its gross anatomy, is not unlike the cellular structure of a human cerebrum.5 Of all our animal psychophvsical functions it is the cerebral which the cosmic life most nearly dupli- cates. It would seem that we can dispense with every other form of physique save the nervous. Let idealism operate to remove that, and the remaining reality is in the last degree unreal and imprac- tical. Thus the cosmic life, like the human, may be conceived as indefinitely changing the form of its neural physique, constantly re- fining its centers and perhaps generating new (astral) nervous systems ad libitum. But the neural gist must persist if the life, human or cosmic, is to be real and practical in its impulses and ideas. Cosmic humanism is thus anthropomorphic in its religious inten- tion. In its essential terms it gratifies men's ingrained passion for human form in the divine life; i. e., by establishing in the place of the overturned God of hands and feet a real community of cerebral experience between man and the universal life. The physique of the cosmic life touches the physique of man in his most sensitive organ, 5 If a cerebrum were magnified to be proportionate with the stellar universe, I imagine the individual neurons would present a spectacle not unlike that of the stars and planets of the elliptoid universe.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 316 the brain. Physical functioning of the highest order (ideal coordi- nations, associations, intracortical strains, and the like) is the same in both. The fourth datum of the cosmic life is thus brain-character. If now we determine what this cerebral function is when void of all the more external organic sensations and functions of the human frame, we shall have some sense of the anthropopathic character of the cosmic life. V The elements left in our conscious processes after the elision of all sensory and organic qualities we are permitted to transcribe into the psychophysical life of the world-soul. We exclude at once all the base constituents of our human experience, all organic and sen- sory processes. The cosmic brain exposes no lobes; nor is it attached sympathetically to the "systems" which enliven our human frames. What, then, is this pure, cerebral experience? 1. There is in our human system a certain grossness of psycho- physical experience. But we aim always to submit our muscle and joint strains, visceral sensations and all that, to the control of our higher, cerebral energies. Now, we may suppose that this subor- dination of lower under higher centers is furthered and affirmed by the cosmic life, for the excellent reason that in the universal life the lower centers are not central and indeed do not exist: all its energies are physically, practically ideaL I dare say, the exquisite energiz- ing of the human organism when the cerebral function is uppermost is due to the fact that its energy is then directly in the stream of the cosmic life's cerebral energy. The human brain duplicates in its measure the physical harmonies of the celestial spheres. 2. Now, if the cosmic life is cerebral, it has more in common with the human than either mystic ecstasy or pessimistic coma has yet dreamed of in their philosophies of escape from phenomenal being. There is a dash of insanity in each of these extremes: mania in the one instance and melancholia with terminal coma in the other. The cosmic character, above all, must be well balanced; it must not blink the facts of its experience in an unbroken, maniacal ecstasy, nor must it wear itself out in the currents of being till it seeks relief in the unconscious silence in which its articulate purposes are set. Just here, I think, we uncover the supreme datum of the cosmic character-its conscious sanity. The cosmic life on its conscious side may well be assaulted by world-weariness. It is indeed in the highest degree probable that the energy-strains of the universal life should become fearfully fatiguing. In such an event the planets would continue on their unbroken course just as our neurons remain in their proper places even while wearing themselves out toward weariness and unconsciousness. Cosmic health and sanity is an</page><page sequence="8">316 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY achievement, as we have already remarked. To balance its world- soul between these extremes of endless, senseless ecstasy, on the one hand and endless, vegetative subconsciousness, on the other, I con- ceive to be the supreme achievement of the cosmic character. These, then, are the congenital feelings in the cosmic life: strain and haul, now ecstatic and again depressant, but with a practical intelligence that maintains the cosmic sanity. 3. The emotions in particular which characterize this balancing process are in the human case the feelings of patience and hopeful- ness. These melioristic feelings lie just between the extremes of world-pain and world-joy. In their pure form they are, we may suppose, non-sensuous, intracortical. Meanwhile, or perhaps just because they are cerebral, they are emotions which simply reek with character. They alone, I fancy, are the emotions which on second thought our anthropopathic religion would be willing to transcribe into the cosmic character. On first thought we select unbroken joy as the pathetic datum of the divine life. But such a gift, as we have seen, cheapens and indeed cancels all the other virtues of con- scious life. Accepting it one's life becomes at once supraconscious and impractical. The desideratum of conscious, practical life would be to face eternity hopefully and patiently. And now this enduring patience and hopefulness are literal data of the cosmic character. They are congenital and ineradicable in the well-balanced mind. Sanity is indeed just practical intelligence, buoyancy, rebounding energy-in a word patience and hopefulness, the ability to await patiently the returning of life's energies and buoyant confidence in life's outcome. Our postulate of the cosmic sanity involves these emotions as its necessary data. FRANK C. DoAN. MEADVILLE THEOLOGICAL SCHOOL.</page></plain_text>
