Along with Akan Christians, these missionaries in Ghana followed local Akan healing practices before the colonial period was formalized, contrary to a pervasive discourse condemning local religion and healing as un-Christian. Around 1885, however, a radical shift in healing practices occurred within the mission and in Germany that corresponded to both the Bacteriological Revolution and the formal colonial period. In 1885 the first medical missionary from Basel arrived in Ghana, while at the same time missionaries began supporting biomedicine exclusively. This posed a great problem for Akan Christians, who began to seek Akan healers coverdy. Akan Christians argued with their European coreligionists that Akan healing was a form of culturally relative therapy, not a rival theology. Keywords Basel Mission, Akan therapeutics, missionary medicine, Ghana, healing Introduction In 1996 the Presbyterian Church of Ghana established a religious healing center in the town of Akropong, the same town in which the first Ghanaian Presbyterian congregation was organized after 1835. Grace Deliverance Center, as this healing center is named, has become a significant part of health care delivery in and around Akropong. The philosophy and practice of Chris tian therapeutics at Grace, developed by Catechist Ebenezer Abboah-OfFei, is common among Pentecostals and Charismatics. Illness and misfortune are often a result of, among other things, patronizing any number of Akan heal ers. In this sense Akan therapy is judged as theology, and most forms of Akan traditional healing?those that interact with non-Christian spirits?are ?

This was not always the case within the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, however. This tradition emerged after the establishment of medical missionaries in 1885 by the Basel Mission, the institutional predecessor of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana. This time period of missionary medicine, prior to the 1880s, has rarely been examined in Africa. Most of the literature on missionary medicine, or more specifically medical missionaries, takes place during the colonial period.1 Other than biographical discussions of David Livingstone2 and Henry Calla way,3 missionary medicine in Africa has rarely been examined earlier than the signing of the Treaty of Berlin.4 In this essay I fill this historical gap by exam ining the healing ideologies and practices of the Basel Mission in Ghana before 1885.5 Furthermore, I discuss the factors involved in the radical shift in heal ing that took place around 1885 when the colonial period became formally instituted in Africa; the Bacteriological Revolution was unfolding in Euro America; and the Basel Mission sent its first medical missionary, Dr. Rudolf Fisch, to Ghana. I have divided this essay into six parts in order to demonstrate the complex and changing conversation between European and Akan Christians concern ing the proper and most effective ways to address illness and misfortune. These six subsections set out the historical stages through which the Basel Mission radically transformed its position regarding healing from one in which it sub scribed to the practices of local healers to one in which the European mission aries, who in large part came from W?rttemberg in southwest Germany, parted ways with their Akan brethren. The shift was a result of the Bacterio logical Revolution that gradually led the European missionaries to support biomedicine exclusively. It was a move, however, that their Akan Christian counterparts did not typically support. The Development and Growth of the Basel Mission, 1828-1918 The Basel Evangelical Missionary Society {Basel Missionsgeselhchaft) was the missionary arm of W?rttemberg Pietism.6 The Mission emerged from the German Society for Christianity {Deutsche Christentumsgesellschafi) as a Bible study and discussion group, created in 1780, that brought together prominent professionals within the Pietist movement. The members founded the Basel Mission in 1815 as a seminary for the education of overseas evangelists. The first graduates were not sent out as Basel missionaries, but joined older estab lished evangelical missions such as the Dutch Missionary Society, the North German Mission Society, and the Church Missionary Society, with which Basel kept particularly close ties.7 By 1821 the founders decided that the</page><page sequence="3">A Mohr I journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 431 Mission had to establish its own religious outposts abroad to bring the distinc tive Pietist worldview to the un-Christianized world. In December 1828, at the invitation of the Danish Crown and the Danish Lutheran Church, the first team of Basel missionaries arrived at the Danish trading settlement of Christiansborg in what is now Ghana. The early years of the Basel Mission in Ghana, from 1828 to 1850, were marked by a high mortality rate of European missionaries and a low conver sion rate among Ghanaians. In the first four years of the Mission from 1828 to 1832, seven missionaries were sent to Ghana and only one, Andreas Riis, survived. Not one Ghanaian convert was made during this time; Riis therefore decided to start a Basel Mission station elsewhere. On March 19, 1835, Riis founded a Basel Mission station in Akropong, the capital of the Akuapem Kingdom, located 25 miles northeast of Accra. Akropong was chosen for three reasons: 1) a lower incidence of malaria due to the high elevation, 2) a popula tion less influenced by amoral European traders, and 3) an escape from Gha naians' suspicion that the Basel missionaries were political agents of the Danish, who at that time controlled Christiansborg.8 However, converts were not easily made in Akropong either. By 1840 twelve years had elapsed since the first Basel missionaries arrived in Ghana and still not a single Ghanaian convert had been made. Meanwhile, eight of the nine Basel missionaries who arrived in Ghana had died. In 1843 a new strategy was put forth by the Basel Mission to try to gain converts. The mission decided to invite West African-descended Jamaicans to Ghana in order to demonstrate that Christianity was also a religion for people of African decent. The Jamaicans landed at Christiansborg on April 17, 1843; the following June they moved to Akropong. More Basel missionaries arrived from Europe throughout the 1840s. By 1851 the Basel Mission had stations in Christiansborg, Akropong, and Aburi, and had made just 21 Ghanaian converts.9 Early Ghanaian converts, particularly in Akropong, tended to fall into a few main categories of persons with ambiguous social status, such as princes who would not become rulers, ex-slaves who could escape servitude through con version, divorced or deserted women, orphans and various people who had broken politico-religious taboos.10 Christianity offered a way out of various existing constraints and promised upward social mobility for the dispossessed. Through the second half of the nineteenth century the number of converts began to grow. The time period from 1850 to 1870 was marked by an accelerated growth rate of the Christian community due to a mastery of Twi by certain missionar ies, evangelical activities in the major Akuapem towns around Akropong, training of Ghanaian personnel, and, more generally, the development of</page><page sequence="4">432 A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 trade and agriculture.11 The most significant growth in the Christian commu nity came from the Basel Mission schools since parents thought it advanta geous to send their children to European-model schools. By 1869 there were eight main mission centers with sixteen small Christian groups attached, a total Christian community of just over 2000.12 The Church continued to grow steadily into the early twentieth century. After 1875 the Basel Mission concentrated its efforts on church building in Ga, Krobo and Akuapem areas and on establishing a church in Asante. In January 1896 the British forces marched on Kumasi, the capital of Asante, and defeated the Asante army. British control of Asante allowed Basel mis sionaries to establish a station in Kumasi in June 1896.13 By 1898 the Basel Mission had 157 congregations, 21 ministers, and 128 schools with nearly 5000 students?comprehensively, a Christian community of 16,806 mem bers in Ghana.14 At this time there were nearly 200 Ghanaian pastors, teachers and other Basel Mission employees.15 By the mid-1910s political conflict between the British and Germans during World War I facilitated the expulsion of the German and Swiss Basel missionaries. By 1916 the British authorities in Ghana began to view the Basel missionaries, who were predominantly German, with suspicion. In the second week of December 1917 all German missionaries were brought to Accra and deported on the sixteenth. On February 2, 1918, all remaining Basel mission aries were ordered home by the Secretary of State in London. The colonial government invited the United Free Church of Scotland to assume responsi bility for the Basel missionary work.16 By the time of the Basel missionaries' deportation in early 1918, the church had grown considerably since its inception 90 years earlier. It claimed more than ten central stations and nearly 200 smaller Basel congregations, which were led by 30 Ghanaian pastors along with several catechists and teachers. The Basel community in 1918 totaled 30,000.17 After 1918 all major institu tional decisions were made by the Ghanaian leadership, and by 1926 a new name?the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast?was adopted (later changed to Presbyterian Church of Ghana at the time of independence in 1957). As previously stated, Basel was the missionary wing of W?rttemberg Pietism. Basel was one of W?rttemberg Pietism's four major centers in the nineteenth century, along with Stuttgart, Korntal and Bad Boll.18 Bad Boll became significant because it was the center of W?rttemberg healing prac tices, where Johann Christoph Blumhardt's Christian healing home or Kur haus was located. In the following section I describe the establishment and significant features of this nineteenth-century Pietist healing movement based in Bad Boll.</page><page sequence="5">A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 433 Christian Healing in W?rttemberg Pietism, 1800-1880 In the early nineteenth century a strand of Pietism emerged in W?rttemberg, led by Christian Gottlieb Blumhardt, which focused on the liberation of the sick from the Devil. The existence of sickness as well as antisocial or immoral behavior was explained by reference to Satan. These themes within Blum hardt's theology of healing and deliverance can be traced to earlier works of Friedrich Christoph Oetinger and even earlier to writings of Johann Albrecht Bengel.19 But neither Oetinger nor Bengel put healing and deliverance at the center of their theology as Christian Blumhardt did. Even more significant than Christian Blumhardt to the development of Christian healing practices was his nephew, Johann Christoph Blumhardt, who became the most impor tant healing and deliverance practitioner in W?rttemberg in the mid-nine teenth century. Johann Christoph Blumhardt's healing and deliverance ministry can be traced back to events that began in 1838. During that summer Blumhardt took a pastorate in Moettlingen where he noticed a total lack of enthusiasm among his parishioners. It was in his efforts to enliven his lethargic Moettlin gen congregation, which often slept through his sermons, that Blumhardt's healing and deliverance ministry came to the fore. It began with the case of a demon-possessed parishioner named Gottlieben Dittus, whose deliverance took almost two full years, from 1841-1843.20 In the early 1840s Gottlieben Dittus experienced a variety of unusual symp toms such as convulsions and seizures, foaming at the mouth, unexplained bleedings, as well as visual and auditory hallucinations of spirits. Many of these symptoms such as visions, hemorrhaging and fainting spells had been occurring since Dittus was a girl. Doctors could not explain many of these disorders, which more than once caused her to lose her job. Because of her pain and suffering, Dittus attempted to take her own life on one occasion. The first step Blumhardt took in helping Dittus was diagnostic: exploring her past in order to determine what afflicting agents were responsible for her maladies. After thoroughly investigating her past, Blumhardt learned that Dittus was abused by a guardian aunt who had exposed her to the popular peasant religion that was widely practiced throughout the region. Blumhardt determined that this exposure to popular peasant religion was directly respon sible for Dittus's afflictions, which in turn were symptoms of demonic posses sion. In time Blumhardt ascertained that Dittus was possessed by over 400 demons, which would often take control of her body and speak through her. Diagnosis gave way to treatment. Blumhardt, having no modern predeces sor's methods to emulate, tried to follow Jesus's healing practices as recorded in the Bible. Over the course of two years, Blumhardt prayed with Dittus</page><page sequence="6">434 A. Mohr I Journal ofReligion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 night and day, fasted, and continually attempted to exorcise the demons. The final battle took place in late December 1843 when the demons also took pos session of Dittus's brother and sister and threatened to kill them. Eventually, however, Blumhardt drove the demons away; as a result, Dittus made a full recovery, which included the disappearance of a high shoulder, a short leg, stomach troubles and various other conditions. Johann Blumhardt's theory of evil, derived from the exorcism of Gottlieben Dittus, made specific reference to aspects of popular peasant religion in W?rt temberg described as idolatry.21 He defined idolatry as belief in a non-Chris tian divine, supernatural and invisible power by which a person could obtain health, honor, wealth, or other types of fortune. By the practice of idolatry, people became bound to satanic powers and oftentimes possessed by his demons. Demons could affect people physically by causing disease or by inducing antisocial feelings and behavior such as lust, drunkenness, avarice, jealousy, and anger. Afflicting demons had to be forcefully cast out. Along with forming Blumhardt's theology of healing and deliverance, Dit tus's healing also sparked a revival in W?rttemberg. Hundreds of people flocked to Moettlingen to repent their sins, which often included participa tion in peasant religion. As a result, many were healed of various afflictions. While the revival was taking place in January 1846, church authorities con demned Blumhardt for praying for the sick instead of sending them to doc tors. Physicians who put pressure on church authorities complained that Blumhardt was infringing on their exclusive right to treat the afflicted. Church authorities forbade Blumhardt to pray for the sick and demanded that he refer them to physicians instead. While Blumhardt never prohibited sufferers from seeking medical attention, he expressed distrust for biomedicai means of heal ing since he believed only God could heal the afflicted.22 Blumhardt believed Christians had to fight for their health with faith, repentance and prayer. Eventually, however, Blumhardt submitted to the Church authorities and stopped praying publicly for the sick. The revival in Moettlingen began to wane once Blumhardt refrained from praying for the sick in 1846. Unhappy with this course of events, Blumhardt decided to search for a new location to establish his healing ministry that would take him out of the Church's sphere of authority. In 1852 Blumhardt purchased a former health spa at Bad Boll, located near Moettlingen and Stuttgart, which became his Kurhaus or faith healing home. Bluhardt's Kurhaus was not completely independent from the Lutheran Church of Germany, however. Bad Boll was designated a 'special' parish by the Church. At Bad Boll Blumhardt was allowed to remain a pastor in the Lutheran Church of Germany, even though he received no salary from the</page><page sequence="7">A Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 435 church. He was permitted to carry out all pastoral functions, such as baptisms, communions, confirmations, weddings and funerals, and the restriction against healing was lifted.23 From 1852 until his death in 1880, Blumhardt ministered to the sick and unfortunate at Bad Boll. Blumhardt's healing and deliverance ministry was not an isolated phenom enon within W?rttemberg Pietism, but was an example of a much wider prac tice within southwest Germany in the nineteenth century. Another major figure from Blumhardt's era whose name was closely associated with him was Dorothea Trudel. Between 1851 and 1856 Trudel opened two healing homes in Mannedorf, Switzerland, in the canton of Zurich to care for the sick. Located in German-speaking Switzerland, Zurich was part of the greater W?rttemberg religious community, as was the town of Basel. In the following section I discuss areas in which Pietist healing and missions overlapped in greater W?rttemberg and in Ghana. The Overlap of Healing and Missions in the Nineteenth Century Missions and healing were both significant aspects of Pietist religious practice in nineteenth-century W?rttemberg: Basel and Bad Boll were two of the four centers of W?rttemberg Pietism. Many leaders of the Pietist movement in W?rttemberg also participated in both spheres of church life. The two most influential healing and deliverance theologians, Christian Blumhardt and his nephew Johan Christoph Blumhardt, worked at the Basel Mission. Christian Blumhardt, who established the first systematic healing theology in W?rttemberg, was the Basel Mission's first Inspector (Director of Mission) from its establishment in 1815 until his retirement in 1838. Johann Blumhardt spent seven years (1830-1837) at the Basel Mission teaching Hebrew, mathematics, physics and chemistry. Upon leaving Basel in 1837 to work in Iptingen, Moettlingen and finally Bad Boll, Blumhardt remained closely attached to the Mission. Blumhardt collected weekly offerings for the Basel Mission every Saturday evening at Bad Boll.24 He was a frequent speaker at mission feasts, informed various congregations of the work of the mission, wrote a handbook about its history, and maintained close contact with mis sionaries throughout his life.25 One of the Basel missionaries who served in Ghana, Elias Schrenk, whose most notable accomplishments in Ghana included petitioning the British to keep the Gold Coast as a colony in 1865 and participating in early cocoa cul tivation in the 1870s, was a strong proponent of Pietist healing.26 Elias Schrenk entered the Basel Mission for training in 1854 at age sixteen, and served as a missionary to Ghana from 1859 to 1872, where he first worked as general</page><page sequence="8">436 A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 treasurer for the Basel Mission in Ghana.27 In 1858, the year before he left for Ghana, Schrenk fell ill and heard God tell him to visit Dorothea Trudel at Mannedorf to be healed. He first visited Blumhardt at Bad Boll; when he was not fully healed he visited Trudel's home in August 1858. In March 1859, Trudel laid hands on Schrenk and healed him entirely, which allowed him to leave for Ghana.28 In Ghana Schrenk described being near death several times only to be healed by Jesus at the last moment.29 Schrenk is the most notable example of a Basel missionary strongly invested in Christian healing and deliverance, although surely many other W?rttemberg missionaries in Ghana shared Schrenk's beliefs in Christian healing during the mid-nineteenth century. These Basel missionaries never established a healing home like Bad Boll in Ghana. The Basel Mission did not systematically teach or practice Christian healing similar to the movement in W?rttemberg. One former missionary suggested that the Baselers could not tell the difference between the Holy Spirit and various demons in cases of possessed Ghanaians, which is a neces sary criterion of the W?rttemberg healing system.30 Another reason, perhaps, was that many Akan Christians did not recognize their sinful behavior, a fact frequently lamented by the missionaries in their reports. Recognition of sin was another necessary criterion for the proper function of this Pietist healing system.31 Whatever the reasons, systematic Christian healing practices based on the model of Bad Boll were never established in Ghana by the Basel missionaries. There were, however, periodic accounts of healing miracles within the Basel community in nineteenth-century Ghana. The most notable healing occurred at Larteh in 1853, five miles south of Akropong, when the Ghanaian catechist Edward Samson raised a boy from the dead with prayer, thereby precipitating a small revival. Thirteen baptisms resulted in the next six months in Larteh, and permission was obtained from the chief to open a school.32 Presbyterian leaders today, many of whom are involved in the healing and deliverance ministry, recall Basel missionaries as more committed to healing through prayer than the archival record suggests. A former moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana (PCG) from 1995 through 1999 wrote that in the nineteenth century the Basel missionaries healed the sick through preaching and prayer, and trained Ghanaian Christians to do the same.33 Catechist Eben ezer Abboah-Offei, who currently manages the Presbyterian Church of Gha na's primary healing center, recalls his grandmother telling him that the Basel missionaries had the power of prayer, could perform miracles, and frequently healed people, especially in the Aburi hospital.34 Similar sentiments were expressed by Edward Okyere, an Akropong Presbyterian whose involvement</page><page sequence="9">A. Mohr I journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 437 in the 1970s in the parachurch organization Scripture Union helped to sup port the emerging Presbyterian healing and deliverance ministry.35 Samuel Atiemo, pastor of the Ghanaian Presbyterian church in Brooklyn, argued that the roots of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana came from Pietist Christianity in which the European and Jamaican missionaries had the power of prayer and the ability to confront and destroy the works of the Devil, which included oppressing Christians with disease and misfortune.36 From the historical accounts given by Ghanaian Presbyterian leaders today, one can deduce that certain missionaries and Akan Christian leaders did alle viate sickness and misfortune through prayer. But formalized healing prac tices, such as those found at Bad Boll, were never established by the Basel Mission in Ghana. Without well-established Christian healing practices, European and Akan Christians in nineteenth-century Ghana relied primarily on various forms of Akan therapy, which I outline in the following section. Akan religion, like W?rttemberg Christianity, had a well-defined ideology about illness, health and healing. Unlike those found in W?rttemberg, Akan therapeutics was heterogeneous, diverse, and inclusive, and its ministration involved a number of different ritual practitioners. Akan Healing in the Nineteenth Century Long before the Basel Mission began evangelizing in Ghana, forms of illness, misfortune, health and healing that made reference to the supernatural were prevalent within Akan healing traditions. A reconstruction of Akan therapeu tic traditions in the nineteenth century during the time period predominately addressed in this essay is a complicated endeavor because the first written accounts were composed by travelers,37 missionaries38 and colonial anthro pologists39 who, at times, were part and parcel of the institutions committed to destroying or controlling Akan healing and/or religious traditions.40 These authors, however, were meticulous in their research, and by disregarding their moral judgments one can reconstruct a partial picture of Akan therapeutic traditions. Because these are the very best and earliest written records of Akan therapeutics in English, I fashion my reconstruction principally from these sources. While multiple ethnic groups exist in Ghana, I focus on the Akan for two reasons. First, they are the largest single ethnic group in Ghana, therefore their healing traditions cover the widest area in the country.41 Second, the Presby terian Church was first established and maintained its strongest presence in the Akan regions of southern Ghana.</page><page sequence="10">438 A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 In Akan religion, illness and misfortune often had a spiritual component, if not an ultimate cause, that needed to be treated through supernatural forces.42 Health and prosperity for both the individual and the community were gener ally maintained through a series of rites of passage associated with birth, puberty, marriage and death, which all involved elders pouring libations for the ancestors as well as worshipping family, clan, village or national deities (abosom).43 Annual rites such as the Odwira ceremony (yam festival)44 and periodic rites such as the Addae festival (every 40 days) were meant to purify and protect the town and/or nation from evil, with libations given to ances tors and other deities.45 Ancestor and deity worship in the context of rites of passage amounted to protection against evil spirits?purveyors of sickness and misfortune?for both the individual and community. In order to maintain the good health of individuals and the prosperity of the community, it was necessary to ensure that relationships among human beings, as well as relationships between humans and spiritual entities, were kept in balance through the reciprocal exchange of gifts. This included sacri fices to deities. If good health, peace and prosperity were achieved, the rites described above were all that was performed. But if a person or group of peo ple became ill or experienced some type of misfortune, help was sought from a variety of spiritual entities and their associated ritual practitioners. An assortment of spiritual entities existed in nineteenth-century Akan reli gion that could potentially assist a sick individual or group of people, as in the case of a famine or epidemic. The sky god (nyame) did not significantly inter act in people's lives due to the more immediate influence of its subordinate deities (abosom).46 There was no fixed pantheon of deities. Deities became more or less popular over time: some were disregarded, while others were introduced from different regions. Three major types of deities existed: regional deities (ornan bosom), family deities (abusua bosom), and prophetic deities (okomfo bosom)41 These deities had anthropomorphic identities and were believed to have been created by the sky god to execute his will regarding people. Each of the deities had different properties. The regional deities were the tutelary spirits of a town, community or state, while the family deities were the guardian spirits of a family or clan. Together, these two classes of spirits were called the old deities (abosom-pan) and inhab ited places and things in nature such as rivers, hills, valleys, rocks, caves, trees or forests (see figure l).48 The old deities were served by priests (osofo), who performed ritual duties to appease the guardian spirit. Some old deities, how ever, were also served by prophets (okomfo) who became possessed by the spirit that spoke through them.49 Sickness within the town, community, state, fam ily or clan was often interpreted as stemming from these old deities. This could</page><page sequence="11">A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 439 occur if the followers of the deity neglected to perform proper rites for the deity or ignored a set of prohibitions for the deity.50 In cases of epidemics, the priests of the old deities would act. In 1883, for example, a whooping cough epidemic struck the southern Ghana town of Kukurantumi and between 60 and 80 children died.51 The reason for this calamity, argued the priests, was the rejection of the town deities by several Christian converts and many young men attending the Basel Mission school in the town. The adults asked the aid and protection of the town deities, who resided in a stone (oho). The priests predicted the destruction of the country by an imminent calamity if the townspeople did not seek protection from the town deity. At this point the head priest told each family head to come to him with a cushion on his head to demonstrate his loyalty and also to swear an oath of allegiance to remain a faithful servant of the deity.52 The head of each family complied, at which time the town deity began to possess its prophets, speaking through them and causing them to dance. After this ritual, the priests began speaking publicly and visited individual homes to tell the inhabitants to offer sacrifices to the town deity in order to suppress its anger. The townspeople followed the priests' advice and made sacrifices of sheep and oiled mashed yams, and many children were dedicated for service to the town deity. The priests also put lit torches in front of the entrance to the Christian quarter, after which they immediately put them out with water, signifying the impending calamity had been averted. In cases of large-scale suffering such as this epidemic, the priests of the old deities were consulted. The third type, the prophetic deities (pkomfo bosom), were referred to as the younger spirits (abosom-mma); they had different characteristics then the older spirits, being focused on individual suffering. The prophetic deities were solic ited by individuals in need, not by groups of people. The prophets of the younger deities were paid considerable amounts of money to assist in healing, to avert misfortune, to detect a person or witch causing an illness, to expose a thief or adulterer, or to procure good luck.53 Prophets (jkomfo) that served prophetic deities also dispensed medicines (aduru).54 Prophetic deities did not reside in natural objects, but were typically in various man-made objects and structures (see figure 2). Another unique feature of the prophetic deities was that they were served by prophets exclusively, not by priests. There were other spiritual entities and practitioners besides prophets that were consulted by individuals to protect and heal or, alternatively, to inflict disease or misfortune on an enemy. These practitioners were medicine makers (aduruyefo), amulet makers (asumanfo) and herbalists (odunsini).</page><page sequence="12">440 A.

Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 441 The medicine maker (aduruyefo) specialized in making medicines (aduru) to treat an array of personal afflictions and social situations: sickness, war, wealth, pregnancy and birth, hunting and agriculture, success in business or at school, love affairs, and family conflicts.55 Medicine was not always a consumable or applied object, but was often spiritual in nature (immaterial). Medicine was an ambivalent power that could provide protection against evils as in sickness, but could also be used to afflict an enemy. An amulet or charm maker (asumanfo) made amulets (suman) that were generally used for personal ends and often kept in the user's house in order to cure sicknesses or alternatively to poison others.56 Amulets were endowed with spiritual powers that were distinct from the deities, although they were at times used in conjunction with them (see figure 3).57 The amulet's power came from the physical and spiritual properties of plants or trees used in its construction, as well as the spiritual power conferred on it from forest dwarfs/ fairies (mmoatia),58 forest monsters (sasabonsom),59 witches (jbayifo),60 or the spirits of the dead.61 Figure 3.

Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 Amulets and amulet making overlapped considerably with medicine and medicine making. Making and distributing amulets for various health and protective purposes was often referred to as making medicine.62 Prophets (okomfo) and medicine makers (aduruyefo) made amulets as well.63 Therefore making amulets or making medicine was not the exclusive domain of either the amulet maker or the medicine maker. As this example indicates, categories of Akan healing practitioner frequently overlapped in any single individual. A third type of healing practitioner consulted in times of sickness was the herbalist {odunsinni) .64 Etymologically, odunsinni is derived from the noun dunsin, meaning the stump of a tree.65 The herbalist made medicine from roots (and herbs), although there was still a spiritual component to this work.66 Alternatively, there were forms of medicines administered and consumed that did not require a ritual specialist. This form of non-spiritual medicine was called abibiduru ('native' or 'country' medicine).67 Native medicine was the only type of therapy that did not have a spiritual component. Native medicine aside, individuals experiencing various problems relating to sickness and misfortune in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would consult these various practitioners to restore their health.68 Afflicted individuals had several options: they could consult a prophetic deity, an amu let maker, an herbalist or a medicine maker. Most of these Akan practitioners were morally ambiguous. Their powers to cure could also be used to afflict, depending on the wishes of the paying client. While certain practitioners did compete over clientele, there was no stand ard discourse of exclusion on par with that found in the W?rttemberg Pietist healing ministry in which participation in peasant religious healing practices was considered sinful and the cause of afflictions. One Akan practitioner could accuse another of causing harm to a client.69 Since practitioners were at times consulted to cause harm to other people this was very logical. But types of practitioners did not systematically try to exclude other types of practitioners. The only spiritual entity referred to as systematically harmful was witches (ibayifo).70 It was in this religious environment, which included these various thera peutic options for healing, that the W?rttemberg Pietists from the Basel Mis sion arrived to evangelize and spread their particular version of Christianity. These Akan healing institutions did not disappear with the establishment of Christianity through the nineteenth century, but coexisted, sometimes symbi otically and sometimes competitively, with churches. As I show in the follow ing section, through at least 1885 European missionaries and Akan Christians followed the local patterns of therapeutic inclusion established by Akan</page><page sequence="15">A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 443 non-Christians when they attempted to procure relief from illness and misfor tune by consulting a variety of Akan healers.71 Basel Mission Therapeutics in Ghana, 1828-1885 The physical separation of Akan Christians from non-Christians was the spa tial embodiment of a discourse of separation from and rejection of Akan reli gion. This physical separation was achieved by the Basel Mission through building a separate Christian quarter called Salem, based on the Korntal model, in every Ghanaian town where they had a church.72 Korntal?another of the four centers of W?rttemberg Pietism?was a self-governing Pietist vil lage kept separate from German society in order to maintain religious purity. It was believed that through separation moral Christian ethics could be better maintained in each Salem by Akan converts within the Christian quarter. Along with the physical separation from Akan religion created by the Chris tian quarter, Basel Missionaries offered Akan Christians means of spiritual separations from Akan religion. Spiritually, separation from Akan religion was marked by the ritual of baptism. At baptism the convert was made to renounce 'the devil and all his works', which meant that the convert could no longer take part in any rites of passage or other rituals associated with Akan religion. Nor could an Akan Christian accept stool office (chieftaincy), since political office was bound to certain Akan religious rituals, such as serving national dei ties, family deities, or ancestors. Throughout the Basel Mission Yearly Reports from 1850 onward, the tenor was one of antagonism toward 'fetishes' (abosom/ deity), 'fetish-priests' (probably ^^m^/prophet), and particularly the pro phetic deities {okomfo bosom), all of which were regarded as agents of the devil and the main obstacles to the spread of Christianity.73 As it had been in W?rt temberg, peasant religion in Ghana was demonized. Demonizing, as men tioned, and separating from Akan religion both physically and spiritually were predominant features of Basel Christianity.74 But this separation was more of a discourse than a practice, particularly with respect to Akan therapeutics before 1885.73 The spiritual separation between Akan religion and Christianity was maintained by neither European missionaries nor Akan Christians with regard to Akan therapeutics.76 In fact, several noted Akan Christians in the Basel community at this time were prac ticing Akan healers of several types, but particularly herbalists.77 There was no spiritual healing alternative offered by the Basel missionaries; they did not introduce any form of Christian ritual protection against harmful evil forces, as was found at Bad Boll. In this environment Akan healers saved the lives of</page><page sequence="16">444 A Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 missionaries and were frequently consulted by Akan Christians. While typi cally ineffective, missionary medicine became another choice within the many existing therapeutic options for both European and Akan Christians in Ghana during the nineteenth century. In the following sections I recount the cases of the European missionary Andreas Riis and the Ghanaian Catechist N. Afwireng, who both suffered from severe illness, as evidence to support the above claims.78 The Case of Missionary Andreas Riis In the nineteenth century West Africa was referred to as the 'White Man's Grave'.79 Travelers, traders and missionaries succumbed to tropical diseases, particularly malaria and yellow fever, at very high rates. In response to this disease environment, the first group of Basel missionaries received medical training in Copenhagen before they left for Ghana, while later missionaries received medical training at the seminary.80 At the seminary Basel missionaries learned to treat tropical diseases with cold baths, bloodletting and arsenic, which were techniques they used in Ghana.81 These techniques, however, were typically ineffective and oftentimes harmful.82 Therefore, the mortality rate? primarily resulting from malaria?was particularly high for Basel missionaries sent to Ghana in the nineteenth century.83 All four missionaries in the first group sent to Ghana died within three years after their arrival in 1828. Three of them passed away within the space of three weeks in August 1829, while the fourth, Johann Philipp Henke, died in November 1831. Henke died before the next three missionaries, Andreas Riis, Peter Petersen Jager, and Christian Frederich Heinze, arrived in March 1832. By the middle of July 1832 only Riis was still alive. In November 1837 two more missionaries arrived in Ghana from Basel, but by April 1938 both were dead. Between 1828 and 1838, nine missionaries were sent to Ghana and only Andreas Riis survived. Like his colleagues, Riis suffered from a variety of ailments in Ghana, but he pursued different therapeutic options than they did. Riis contracted malaria in September 1832 and was nursed at the plantation of George Lutterodt. Lutterodt was a European farmer who had been in Ghana since about 1805 and often cared for sick missionaries, such as Peter Peterson Jager, before Riis.84 Riis recovered, not due to any treatment given by Lutterodt but due to the care of an African doctor (Neger-Doctor) who prescribed cold ablutions and topical applications of lemon and soap. The healer who treated Riis was frequently consulted by the Christiansborg European community.85 After this treatment Riis fully recovered in the Akuapem hills, where he arrived on October 24.86</page><page sequence="17">A. Mohr I journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 445 After his recovery in Akuapem, Riis accepted an invitation from Governor Helmuth V. Ahrensdorf to preach and teach European children within Chris tiansborg Castle.87 Riis lamented his living and working among Europeans since this appointment was contrary to his mission, but he argued that it was the best way for him to maintain good health.88 But Riis's good health did not last long. By April 1834 Riis contracted another serious illness and was once again cured by a local healer.89 During this illness Riis claimed that Dr. Tietz, the European physician in Christiansborg, was useless.90 Riis argued that all patients treated by Dr. Tietz died, while those treated by the local healer survived.91 Riis was not the only missionary to be successfully treated by local Akan healers. Johannes Zimmerman, who wrote the first Ga dictionary and trans lated the first Ga Bible, was also cured of a serious illness by an Akan healer after biomedicine failed to restore his health. Both Riis and Zimmerman spoke of the transforming effect they experienced as a result of being cured by an Akan healer.92 But who exactly were these local healers who successfully treated the Basel missionaries like Riis? As I explained previously, if one became sick in Ghana there were a variety of Akan therapeutic practitioners one could choose to potentially alleviate one's illness. The missionary reports usually referred to an 'African doctor', 'traditional doctor', or 'fetish priest'. There was the prophet {okomfo), the amulet maker (asumanfo), the herbalist (odunsinni), and the medicine maker (aduruyefo), all of whom had the capacity to heal. All these healers made dif ferent sorts of medicine: some were material and consumed (like pharmaco peias), some were material and not consumed (like amulets), and others were spiritual and immaterial (like prayers). All four practitioners incorporated some form of spiritual ritual into their healing techniques.93 Healers of any one of these types or some combination thereof could have treated Riis, Zim merman and many other Basel missionaries. These missionaries were follow ing an Akan therapeutic pattern that was inclusive, unlike the exclusive forms of religious healing popularized at Bad Boll. Akan Christians like Catechist N. Afwireng took a similar course of action when ill. The Case of Catechist N. Afwireng Like European missionaries, Akan Christians suffered from a variety of afflic tions in nineteenth-century Ghana. An 1887 missionary report from the Kingdom of Kwahu, located northwest of Akuapem, indicated that smallpox, measles and whooping cough were endemic.94 Most people had skin infections, and a significant number suffered from leprosy, fever and dysentery as well.95 Because of the high frequency of the sickle-cell gene in Akan populations,</page><page sequence="18">446 A. Mohr I journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 malaria was not as statistically fatal for local populations as it was for Euro pean missionaries. For most of these diseases, missionary medicine was completely ineffective. Akan Christians, like non-Christian Akan and the European missionaries in the nineteenth century, followed a therapeutically inclusive model in which a number of different healers and types of healers were consulted to find relief from various afflictions. One particularly detailed account followed Catechist Afwireng, whose illness and treatment in 1885 was recorded in a Basel Mis sion report.96 In early 1885 Catechist N. Afwireng, who worked at the Basel station in Abetifi, traveled to the town of Obo and afterward became chronically ill. In two months he developed severe pains in his arms and legs, and was near death. Afwireng was taken to Akropong, where he arrived with a swollen foot. Reverend Dilger (see figure 4), a Basel missionary, believed that the swollen foot was a symptom of his previous illness and prescribed rest in order to cure this affliction. Traditional doctors' were consulted, who told Afwireng he was being spiritually poisoned. This convinced Afwireng of the supernatural root of his illness. The Catechist needed another expert opinion. Afwireng then consulted another Akan healer named Kwabi (see figure 5), who at this time if not later became a Catechist (and possibly a pastor) in the Basel Mission.97 A passage describes Kwabi's treatment of Afwireng as 'drastic' without being more specific. Kwabi also prescribed Afwireng a substance to rub into his skin and a therapeutic liquid to drink. A few days larer Afwireng began to have fainting spells, which caused him anxiety, and many, including Afwireng himself, believed his life was in danger. Kwabi commented that his good medicine would be of no use if God had already decided to take his life. This statement caused Afwireng extreme anxiety. As the fainting spells contin ued, the missionaries suggested that Afwireng travel with Kwabi to his home in Mpraeso to receive treatment for an extended period of time. Before traveling to Mpraeso with Kwabi, Afwireng asked for Dilger's thoughts about consulting another Akan healer, whom Dilger described pejo ratively as 'not only a heathen but a bad one'. This healer, whose name was not given, was a relative of Afwireng and was eventually consulted by the ailing Catechist. The new healer deduced that the 'fetish priest' (probably an okomfol prophet) from Obo had spiritually poisoned Afwireng. As a result, the healer advised Afwireng and Kwabi to claim from the Obo prophet the money they lost (presumably from lost work and therapeutic costs) since the beginning of the illness.98 Both healers?Kwabi and Afwireng's relative?told the Obo prophet that he should come to Akropong and heal Afwireng. The prophet denied that he</page><page sequence="19">A. Mohr I journal ofReligion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 Figure 4. Rev. Gottlob Dilger. Ref. no. QS-30-001.0676.01. Unknown Studio. Figure 5. Rev.

Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 poisoned Afwireng and swore the Kwahuhene's oath (oath of the chief of Kwahu) that it was not he who had caused Afwireng's illness." The case was brought before the Kwahuhene's court, which ruled against the Obo prophet. Kwabi was awarded twenty dollars in order to cover the cost of Afwireng's treatment and to compensate him for lost time. Reverend Dilger intervened at this point and told Kwabi it was inappropriate to accept this money.100 Instead, the Basel Committee promised to reimburse Kwabi 20 dollars for his previous treatment of Afwireng. Although the lawsuit was settled and Kwabi was compensated in principle, Afwireng was still very ill. The missionaries suggested that Afwireng be sent to Dr. Rudolf Fisch, the medical missionary in Aburi who had arrived in Ghana earlier in 1885, as a last attempt to cure him. After Afwireng's arrival in Aburi, Deacon Obeng, Afwireng's brother, requested that Afwireng be sent to him in Nsakye. This request was apparently denied, and Afwireng was examined and treated by Fisch. Fisch observed that Afwireng had multiple health problems: anemia, damage to his left lung, an enlarged spleen, abnormally numerous white blood corpuscles of the large linear type, as well as eye problems, urine problems and a psychological condition due to loss of hope. Fisch's final diag nosis was lineal anemia and hysterical melancholy. For this, Fisch prescribed arsenic in mounting doses. Afwireng stayed only four days at the hospital; the account of his illness ends when he left Fisch's care. During the course of his illness Afwireng consulted up to 20 different Akan healers as well as the missionary doctor for treatment of his illness. One mis sionary reported that the Akan healers consulted by Afwireng were mostly 'fetish priests' and 'soothsayers' (probably jkomfo).101 One healer made a 'fet ish' (sumanl'amulet) for Afwireng in order to treat his illness; this person may have been an amulet maker (asumanfo), prophet (okomfo) or medicine maker (aduruyefo). All parties in Ghana?European missionaries, Akan Christians or non-Christian Akan?relied primarily on Akan healers for their health care until at least 1885. Therapeutic Shifts in W?rttemberg and the Missionfield, 1885 to 1918 Toward the end of the nineteenth century W?rttemberg Pietist therapeutics began to shift from Christian healing of the sort institutionalized at Bad Boll to biomedicine. This shift, driven by the Bacteriological Revolution in Europe, affected the Basel Mission, which in 1885 sent its first medical missionary, Dr. Rudolf Fisch, to Ghana (Fisch in his Aburi dispensary is pictured in figure 6). From the 1880s onward, a gradual shift away from consulting Akan healers and toward relying exclusively on biomedicine occurred among Basel mis</page><page sequence="21">A. Mohr I journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 449 sionaries in Ghana. For Akan Christians this caused a significant problem. Many believed that illness and misfortune had supernatural causes and thus needed to be redressed by supernatural means. Consequently, many Akan Christians continued to rely on Akan healers for a variety of afflictions. Shifts in W?rttemberg Healing: From Spiritual Therapy to Biomedicine In 1880 Johann Christoph Blumhardt died. In his later years at Bad Boll, his theology shifted. In the early part of Blumhardt's ministry, he viewed healing as a purely supernatural process enacted by the Holy Spirit and accomplished by invoking the name of Jesus. He strongly questioned the effectiveness of biomedicai means of healing. The tension between his healing system and the medical establishment was exacerbated when the medical community, which lobbied Church authorities, succeeded in forcing Blumhardt to stop perform ing Christian healing rituals such as laying on of hands and praying for the afflicted. But later in Blumhardt's life he became disillusioned with the effec tiveness of healing through prayer and was convinced that medicine played a significant role in healing, even to the point of recommending that most of the sick that came to Bad Boll should consult physicians.102 Toward the end of his life Blumhardt believed that doctors served as instruments through whom God provided healing: a discourse generally adopted by medical mis sionaries during this time.103 This new investment in biomedicine by Blumhardt and within W?rttem berg Pietism was significantly influenced by the Bacteriological Revolution in Europe during the 1880s. During this time a series of discoveries of specific causal agents of infectious disease transformed medical practice and theory in Europe, most notably by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch. This included the discovery of the bacteria causing typhoid and leprosy (1880), tuberculosis (1882), cholera (1883), diphtheria and typhois (1884), pneumococcus (1886) and malta fever (1887). These scientific advances significantly influenced evangelical missions and contributed to the emergence and development of medical missions generally.104 By the time of Blumhardt's death in 1880 heal ing evangelism and practices had begun to wane in W?rttemberg, as evidenced by the theological shift of Blumhardt. This change from Christian healing to biomedicine within late W?rttemberg Pietism also corresponded with a shift in practices in the mission field. Shifts in Mission Therapy: From Akan Healers to Medical Missionaries Before 1885 the Basel Mission and Basel missionaries in Ghana had little investment in biomedicine, although instruction in personal health care in the</page><page sequence="22">450 A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 tropics was formally taught in the seminary to outgoing missionaries after 1845.109 The first Basel Mission doctor arrived more than 50 years prior to Dr. Fisch's in 1885, but C. F. Heinze died six weeks after his arrival in 1832. After Heinze's death and up to 1885, several missionaries requested that phy sicians be sent to Ghana. By 1843 Rev. Widmann suggested to the Home Board that it would be good to have a Christian doctor in Ghana.106 In 1863 Elias Schrenk expressed plans to the Home Board for the construction of a mission hospital with an accompanying physician.107 In 1865 the head of the (British) Government Medical Office, who had treated the Basel missionaries for a long period, decided to leave and suggested that the Mission send its own doctor to Ghana. In 1866 J. G. Christaller's wife died, after which time he asked the Mission to send a doctor to study local health practices, medicines and illnesses.108 In 1870 Elias Schrenk's third request for a missionary doctor was given more consideration by the Mission.109 Schrenk argued that mission aries were obligated to heal the sick but no longer had the power of Jesus to spiritually accomplish this goal. Finally, in 1882, Dr. Ernst Mahly was sent to Ghana with the task of inves tigating the particular health problems there over a two-year period. Mahly's report gave several recommendations with regard to the prevention of disease through proper clothing and diet, as well as the treatment of common dis eases. As a result of this report the Basel Home Board decided to send medical doctors and nurses to Ghana. Some of the board members, unhappy with this move, considered the decision to send doctors and nurses indicative of a lack of faith.110 This faction of the Home Board believed that Christians should trust in God alone for their healing, in agreement with Blumhardt's earlier approach to illness. When Fisch was appointed to Ghana as a medical missionary in 1885, he established a sanitorium and dispensary in Aburi, a town on the Akuapem ridge near Akropong. Fisch's responsibilities included caring for the mission aries at scattered stations and conducting outpatient clinics at the two medical stations in Aburi and Abokobi.111 The small hospitals at Aburi and Abokobi grew steadily, due to an increase in treatment of both Ghanaians and Europe ans. In 1912 there were over 20,000 outpatients treated at Aburi and Abokobi with 129 admitted to the 12 hospital beds.112 The Home Board decided to build a modern, well-equipped hospital at Aburi, but the project was halted due to the deportation of the Basel missionaries in 1918. As biomedicai means of healing became more effective in the first decade of the twentieth century, there was much less reliance by missionaries in Ghana on Akan healers. Missionaries like Riis and Zimmerman owed their lives to Akan healers, but by the time of Catechist Afwireng's illness in 1885 some of</page><page sequence="23">A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 451 Figure 6. Dr. Rudolph Fisch's Aburi dispensary, 1897. Ref. No. QW-30.006.001. Photograph taken by Dr. Rudolph Fisch. the missionaries were skeptical of the idea of being spiritually poisoned by malevolent spiritual forces and hence questioned the effectiveness of Akan healers.113 This attitude, of course, was enabled by the treatment of malaria with quinine that came into practice by the mid-nineteenth century.114 Dur ing Fisch's tenure in Ghana he was able to reduce missionary mortality from 36 percent to 6 percent through the prophylactic use of quinine.115 As bio medicine became more of an empirical and rationalist science, it shut itself off from non-Western forms of knowledge, thereby derogating their value. Euro peans reduced African healing systems to 'magic' and 'herbs'.116 After Fisch's arrival the therapeutic options supported by the missionaries shifted toward biomedicine, but not immediately.117 While 1885 marked the beginning of a transitional period, evidence suggests that some Basel mission aries continued consulting Akan healers into the twentieth century.118 For Akan Christians biomedicine did not address the evil spirits believed to be the cause of many illnesses and cases of misfortune, nor did the Basel Missionaries acknowledge the existence of these malevolent spirits.119 Akan Christians, alternatively, did believe in the ability of harmful spirits to afflict them and consulted Akan healers in the latter years of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. This caused considerable friction with European mis sionaries, who more and more complained of the 'superstitious Africans'. At this time therapeutic choices by Akan Christians began to be judged more as theological choices by the Basel missionaries.120</page><page sequence="24">452 A Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 In a report from 1894 Rev. Rusler described a problem within the Basel Christian community in the town of Anum, where many local Christians still observed superstitions and feared evil spirits.121 An elder in the church believed that there was a wicked spirit in his house, causing him misfortune and anxi ety. Rev. Rusler lamented that the elder was not content to pray about it but secretly went to an Osumanni' (amulet maker/asumanfo), who gave him an amulet as well as medicine to place around his house. Rev. Rusler concluded that the missionaries must continue to fight against these practices that were contrary to God's word. When confronted by missionaries, local Christians in Anum tried to explain these forms of therapy as local customs to be treated by their European brethren with a certain amount of cultural relativity. Conclusion Through the first 90 years of the Basel Mission in Ghana from 1828 to 1918, the mission was established and grew slowly. The Basel missionaries tried to replicate a W?rttemberg Christian peasant society in which agriculture, ani mal husbandry and crafts were promoted as well as the physical and spiritual separation from deleterious influences of non-Christian peasant society. A strong discourse emerged among the missionaries that portrayed Akan reli gion as demonic, but this discourse did not correspond with the Basel Chris tian community's participation in Akan therapeutics. Until 1885 when the first Basel medical missionary arrived in Ghana, Euro pean missionaries and Akan Christians frequently consulted a variety of Akan healers. From this time to the end of the century a shift gradually occurred, driven by, to an extent, the scientific discoveries of the Bacteriological Revolu tion. Biomedicai forms of healing became more accepted and eventually were exclusively promoted by missionaries in Ghana as well as in W?rttemberg. Akan healers were consulted less frequently by missionaries, who began to question the validity and legitimacy of local healing practices. While the Euro pean missionaries began to use biomedicine exclusively for treatment of their diseases, Akan Christians continued to solicit help from Akan healers. At times this solicitation occurred covertly since European missionaries discouraged this practice, as did colonial authorities who frequently outlawed various forms of Akan healing.122 Only Akan healers, however, provided ritualized protection from malevolent spiritual forces believed to be the cause of many disorders. Healing-centered forms of Christianity?denominations that shared much in common with Blumhardt's ministry at Bad Boll?did not emerge in Ghana until the first fifth of the twentieth century, when the Christian Catholic</page><page sequence="25">A. Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 453 Church (1900), Church of the Twelve Apostles (1915) and Faith Tabernacle Congregation (1918) offered its members religious healing practices that provided ritual protection against the evil spirits believed to cause disease and misfortune.123 The great success of Faith Tabernacle and its Pentecostal branches?particularly the Church of Pentecost?within the Presbyterian community eventually compelled the Presbyterian Church of Ghana to recog nize malevolent spiritual forces and incorporate Christian therapy by the 1960s.124 References Bartels, Francis L. 1965.

Comaroff and Comaroff 1997: 328-329; Gelfand 1957; Vaughn 1991: 57. 3. Etherington 1987: 77. 4. A dissertation written by Friedrich Fischer (1991) in German did explore issues of health and healing within the Basel Mission during this time period in southern Ghana. This dissertation, like the earlier literature on Livingstone and Callaway, was biographical in orientation, focusing on the first medical missionary to Ghana, Rudulf Fisch. The data that I analyzed for this article is broader than Fischer's and my analysis and conclusions also differ. I did, however, use Fischer's dissertation as a secondary source in this essay. 5. I will use the postcolonial name 'Ghana' throughout this paper to refer to the colo nial Gold Coast prior to 1957. 6. The Inspector or Director of Mission was always an ordained W?rttemberg Pietist; at any given time almost half of the missionaries were from W?rttemberg (Smith 1966: 21). 7.

Oetinger believed that sin and demonic forces caused illness, while the role of demons in human suffering can be traced to Bengel (Macchia 1993: 26-7). 20. The most thorough account in English describing Blumhardt's healing ministry is found in Zuendel 2000 [1880]. 21. Popular peasant religion in Germany influenced the Grimm Brothers fairy tales, such as Hansel and Gretel, Rumpelstiltskin and Snow White. Although from Hesse not W?rttemberg, the Grimm brothers collected German folk tales that had variants from other German regions including W?rttemberg (Kamenetsky 1992: 118-123). 22.

Rosier stated, what is so painful in so many of our Christians is their scanty consciousness of sin... Many in conversation claim to have no sin... and feel they are Christians when they have paid their church tax and been to church on Sundays' (Annum Correspondence, Rosler's Report for the Year 1894, dd. 30 Jan. 95.

Ellis 1887; Rattray 1923, 1927. While Rattray was doing research on Akan religion and healing in the early twentieth century and not the nineteenth, I have included his observations because his research was so thorough and was also conducted in the first quar ter of the twentieth century. 40. Because therapeutics in Africa typically involves the supernatural, Western catego ries of religion and health significantly overlap in the African context. Thus, the history of healing in Africa closely resembles and overlaps with the history of religion (see Feierman and Janzen 1992b: 4).</page><page sequence="29">A Mohr I Journal of Religion in Africa 39 (2009) 429-461 457 41. This is not to suggest that Akan therapeutic practices were culturally or historically bound. Akan therapeutic systems, like those of other African ethnic groups, were extremely flexible and incorporative, especially compared with (the modernist discourse of) orthodox European medicine in the Victorian era. 42. Material-based forms of healing such as inoculating and bone setting that had little or no spiritual component were also a part of the Akan healing repertoire in the nineteenth century (see Maier 1979). 43. For a more thorough discussion of Akan rites of passage, see Rattray (1927: 48-191). The asamanfo are defined as ancestral spirits (Rattray 1927: 11) or spirits of the dead or ghosts (Christaller [1881] 1933: 423). 44. For a significantly more nuanced analysis of Odwira in Asante, see McCaskie (1995: 144-242). 45. Rattray 1927: 127. 46. Christaller [1881] 1933: 598. 47. Ibid. 48.

The cushion, on which head loads are carried, in this context, is the symbol of a slave, signifying subjugation. As slaves are subservient to their masters, these people, carry ing cushions on their heads, are subjects of their deity (ibid). 53. Ellis [1887] 1964:124. Christaller ([1881] 1933: 598) claims only the okomfo bosom were consulted in sickness and misfortune, while Ellis ([1887] 1964: 92-3) states that abu sua bosom were also consulted in sickness and misfortune. 54. Christaller [1881] 1933: 598. 55. Rattray 1927: 40; Christaller [1881] 1933: 101. The etymology of medicine maker comes from aduru, meaning medicine, drug, powder or poison and ayefo&gt; which is a maker, author, mischief-maker, or mischievous enemy (Christaller [1881] 1933: 101, 587). Alter nate spellings are oduyefo, oduyefo or oduruyefo. 56. Christaller [1881] 1933: 600. Rattray refers to this practitioner as Sumankwafo (1927: 26). Christaller translated asumanfo to sorcerer, magician or wizard ([1881] 1933: 483). Some evidence indicates that amulets were used to avert all evils accept sickness and death, which was dealt with in other ways (Bowdich [1819] 1966: 271). 57. Rattray 1927: 11-12,23. 58. References to mmotia are found in Rattray (1927). 59. Sasabonsam is described as a forest monster with a huge human-shaped body and having red skin and long hair, who was believed to be the friend and chief of the sorcerers and witches (Christaller [1881] 1933: 429). 60. obayifo is the female witch, while bonsam refers to the male. Witches, almost always of the female variety, use their powers of destruction only within their own clan or family (Rattray 1927: 28). Witches eat people by sucking their blood and cause general misfor tune to people within their families (Rattray 1927: 29). 61. Rattray 1927: 23.</page><page sequence="30">458 A.

Odunsinni was translated as native physician, medicine-man, charmer, sorcerer, or wizard (Christaller [1881] 1933: 99). An alternate spelling is Dunsefo (Rattray 1927: 40). 65. Christaller [1881] 1933:99. 66. Rattray argues that the Akan herbalist (dunseni) or amulet maker (sumankwafo) believes that some leaf or root or plant is effective against a particular disorder because its spiritual potency is stronger than that of the affliction which it acts upon (1927: 39, 20). 67. Christaller [1881] 1933: 20. 68. There was another Akan practitioner, mentioned briefly in Christaller's dictionary, but not in any of the other sources. This was the Jsafo (not to be confused with osofo, the priest), defined as one who cures a disease: curer, healer, physician ([1881] 1933: 419). Perhaps this was a general term encompassing all Akan healers? 69. See the extended case of Catechist Afwireng later in this chapter. 70. Christaller [1881] 1933: 11. 71. In fact, research shows this was not a localized practice in Ghana, but within differ ent regions throughout sub-Saharan Africa (Feierman and Janzen 1992a). 72. Jenkins 1980: 430. 73. Smith 1966: 89; Middleton 1983: 5.1 put fetish and fetish priest in quotations to indicate the exact language used in the Basel missionary reports and their English transla tions. I will continue to use this method throughout the chapter, indicating when applica ble, what entity that word or phrase was referring to. 74. For a treatment of Pietist missionaries demonizing Ewe religion in Eastern Ghana, see Meyer (1999). 75. There were several areas within the Basel mission project in Ghana where discourse and practices did not correspond. Miller (2003) refers to these disjunctures as organiza tional contradictions. Also, Hokkanen (2007: 357-75) finds the same disjuncture within Scottish Missionary circles in northern Malawi in the late nineteenth century. 76. This discourse was produced particularly within Basel mission reports. We should not take for granted that missionaries in Ghana were writing reports specifically for the Mission Board in Europe. This discourse of separation and demonization of Akan religion could have been produced to maintain forms of support from the Home Board. For exam ple, Roman Catholic missionaries in East Africa would systematically misrepresent African religion and culture in the missionary press, portraying African misery and savagery in order to increase their funding by patrons troubled by these images (Keiran 1969). This might explain the contradiction between Basel missionaries demonizing Akan religion on the one hand and consulting Akan healers on the other. 77. See Fischer 1991: 504-10. Other Akan Christians in the nineteenth century who practices some form of Akan therapeutics included: Joshua Donko of Nsakye who was an herbalist (odunsinni); Pastor Carl Reindorf who was an herbalist; an unnamed Christian in Teshi who by 1882 was treating Christians and non-Christians; and Catechist Noah Akwai, who was an Akan healer and successfully treated European missionaries in the 1870s. 78. These two case studies were chosen because of the wealth of information about their illnesses in the Basel Mission reports. These two cases were not unique however, but were typical among European missionaries and Akan Christians before the 1880s. 79. West Africa (and Sierra Leone specifically) by the early 1820s was known as the 'white man's grave' (Fyfe 1962: 151; Comaroff and Comaroff 1997: 350).</page><page sequence="31">A.

It is possible too that the healers consulted by the missionaries in and around Christiansborg were Ga healers and not Akan healers as the Ga and not Akan comprise the local population in and around Accra. 90. Ibid. 91. Ibid. 92. Miller 2003: 144-5. 93. All the reports referred to a therapeutic practitioner: therefore I conclude that the Christians were not treated with country medicine (abibiduru), which did not require a specialized practitioner and was non-spiritual. 94.

Figure 5?a photograph from the Basel Mission Archive? lists Kwabi as a Pastor, not a Catechists. 98. The passage claims that since this healer was a relative of Afwireng, he could not claim money for his services. Rev. Dilger, who wrote this report, believed that is why this healer suggested the legal battle: i.e., to procure funds. 99. Oaths taken in the context of a legal dispute were meant to attest to the truthful ness of the statement (Ellis 1964 [1887]: 198). Obo, like Abetifi, is a town in the Kwahu kingdom therefore the oath taken would have been that of the local political authority, the Kwahuhene, or chief of Kwahu. 100. Dilger felt it was immoral to 'take vengeance in this way,' meaning, perhaps, seek ing retribution from a prophet.</page><page sequence="32">460 A.

Schrenk was also troubled by the fact that Ghanaian Christians when sick would consult with Akan prophets ('fetish priests'), which in his opinion was regressing to their previous religion.

The people of Anum are not Akan, but are ethnically Guan. Because of the long history of interaction between Guan with Akan peoples (particularly in Akuapem), I will assume that these occurrences in the Basel mission Guan community of Anum would have been the same as in Basel mission Akan communities. 122. See for example Gray 2001. 123. William Wade Harris' evangelization in and around Axim in 1914 led to the establishment of the Church of the Twelve Apostles around 1915. This healing-centered church was predated in Axim by a small Christian Catholic Church congregation (from 1900 to 1905)?followers of John Alexander Dowie?which, perhaps, established a cer tain sympathetic audience for Harris' message of Christian healing and deliverance.

Interestingly, Faith Tabernacle began originally as a Philadelphia branch of the Christian Catholic Church, but eventually became fully inde pendent after 1899 due to some minor theological differences (M?hr, forthcoming). 124.
