<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 573 This English translation has been made by Jacob's grandson, who has added a valu- able biographical introduction based on family memories and correspondence as well as published accounts. The German text itself has recently been published (Das Buch Exodus [Stuttgart, 1997]), and random comparisons of the translation with this indicate a considerable use of paraphrase by the translator and the presentation of Jacob's thoughts in a less rhetorical and slightly briefer form than he himself preferred. But there is no reason to call this an "abridged" translation: the essentials are there, even if the finer points of the commentary are sometimes not precisely represented (see, e.g., pp. 137 and 350). The system of transliteration used for Hebrew words is not a mod- ern scholarly one and, while it is generally clear what is meant, this is not always the case. Nevertheless, the English version of the commentary will make Jacob's detailed exposition of the Masoretic text, with its philological and exegetical acumen, available to a much wider readership. His steadfast opposition to source-analysis limits the use- fulness of the commentary, though even this may please some. In fact current empha- sis on reading "the final form of the text" promises to give Jacob's work a warmer welcome now than it would have received in the 1940s. A useful index of subjects and scholars (with sub-entries) is included in a pocket at the back. [G.I. DAVIES] K. JEPPESEN, Kirsten NIELSEN and B. ROSENDAL (ed.), In the Last Days. On Jewish and Christian Apocalyptic and its Period. 261 pp. Aarhus University Press, Aarhus, 1994. DK 198. This book dedicated to Benedikt Otzen consists of 21 essays on Apocalyptic and its historical context. The volume begins with a consideration of Gnosticism, Jewish Apocalypticism, and Early Christianity by Per Bilde. This is followed by five articles on particular aspects of Apocalyptic: Eduard Nielsen gives a note on Zech. xiv 4-5, Jes P. Asmussen introduces a Judaeo-Persian Daniel Apocalypse, Jakob Balling con- siders the concept of Martyrdom as Apocalypse, Sten Hidal examines the writings of Hippolytus and Theodoret of Cyrrhus on Daniel, Kirsten Nielsen writes on the Apocalypse of Sedrach, and Johannes B. Glenthoj presents the story of the robber in Syriac Christianity. The next two articles consider the contribution of two great O.T. scholars to the field of Apocalyptic: Magne Saebo looks at Gerhard von Rad, and Else Kragelund Holt considers Sigmund Mowinckel. The next six articles look at a variety of topics which form a background to Apocalyptic: Niels Peter Lemche considers the development from Prophetism to Apocalyptic; Hans M. Barstad, prophecy in Qumran; Bent, pop- ular wisdom in Qohelet, Svend Holm-Nielsen, the idea of Job as scapegoat; Hans J. Lundager Jensen, the idea of the Cosmic wedding; and Knud Jeppesen, the origin of the phrase "Then began men to call upon the name of Yahweh". The final five articles in this extremely eclectic collection look at a range of subjects covering Hieroglyphics, Emblems and Picture-Puzzles by Carsten Bach-Nielsen, Hellenism in Archaeology by John Strange, the Hellenistic Palaces of the Jewish Kings by Inge Nielsen, the lan- guage of the book of Daniel by Frederick H. Cryer, and the problems of giving this period a name by Gabriella Dahm. The book ends with a list of the works of Benedikt Otzen compiled by Pernille Carstens. [Paula GOODER] N.P. LEMCHE, Die Vorgeschichte Israels: von den Anfangen bis zum Ausgang des 13. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. Biblische Enzyklopadie 1. 231 pp. W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart, Berlin and Koln, 1996. This book, the first in a new series, is divided into four parts. PartI (pp. 9-73) is concerned with the biblical picture of the period discussed. Lemche first summarizes the account given in Genesis, Exodus and Numbers, and then argues that their contents should be regarded as narrative ("Erzahlung") rather than as history. Both the nature of the stories and the length of time between the composition of the biblical books and the happenings that they purport to portray tell against their histor- ical reliability. The stories of Abraham and his descendants in Genesis are best defined as "Familiengeschichte" (p. 22), not history. Further, Lemche maintains that arguments in favour of locating a patriarchal age in a particular period are unconvincing (names of people and places, and ethnic groups; the nomadic and allegedly early characteristics</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST of patriarchal life; affinity between patriarchal customs and those of the pre-Israelite period; and patriarchal religion as understood by A. Alt). The story of Joseph is, he holds, to be regarded "als eine Novelle oder sogar als einen Roman" (pp. 47-8). The story cannot be convincingly related to a particular person or time, and some elements in it cannot be dated before the Persian period (p. 51). Lemche questions the historicity of the narratives in the books of Exodus and Numbers. In his assessment of their contents, he follows G. von Rad and others in separating the tradition of the exodus from that of the giving of the law on Mount Sinai. These and other traditions are linked by the figure of Moses, and Lemche regards the link as secondary, though he does not deny the possibility of the historicity of Moses. In his opinion, the various traditions are legendary in character, and he is scep- tical about theories of a flight from Egypt of a much smaller group than the large numbers of the biblical account. Thus, Lemche concludes that the Pentateuch does not offer us reliable sources of historical information of the "Vorzeit", but is dealing "um literarische Kunstprodukte" (p. 69). Further, there are anachronisms that point to a date much later than the Bronze Age. For example, Gen. xi 31 refers to Ur of the Chaldees, but the Chaldeans did not move into southern Mesopotamia before the 8th century B.C.; and Gen. xxiv mentions camels, but they were not domesticated until shortly before 1000 B.C. We must look outside the O.T. for evidence of the period between c. 1300 and 1200 B.C. Part II (pp. 74-150) offers an historical reconstruction of the period. Lemche dis- cusses the written sources of information and the evidence supplied by archaeological research, and then the geography, climate, etc. of Syria-Palestine from the Early Bronze Age down to the Habiru and the Sea Peoples in the 12th century B.C. There is, he believes, reason to think that elements of the Habiru "von den spateren israelitischen Stammen aufgenommen worden sind" (p. 150). Part III (pp. 151-201) is devoted to "Elemente des Geisteslebens" and discusses different kinds of literature, both official and unofficial, and also religion and the ways in which gods and human life were viewed, the cult, magic and prophecy. I found this one of the most interesting parts of Lemche's book-in, for example, his comments on the statue of Idrimi and its text, and on the Ugaritic texts. Lemche does not dis- tinguish sharply between myth and legend in the epic texts from Ugarit, and he ques- tions a purely cultic interpretation of them. They confirm him in his view that "es im Syrien-und wohl auch im Palastina-der Bronzezeit eine bluhende Volksliteratur gegeben hat" (p. 181). Part IV (pp. 208-24) considers more theological questions. First, although the Pentateuch has many points of contact with other ancient Near Eastern texts, it differs from those of the Bronze Age, especially in its monotheism; and its prose texts pre- suppose a literate public. Second, Lemche discusses the purpose of the writings as they may be understood if the texts of the Pentateuch are dated in the 10th century, or the late 7th century in the age of Josiah, or the exilic period, or in post-exilic times (the 5th, the 4th, or even the 3rd century B.C.); and Lemche favours the post-exilic period. Finally, he seeks to answer the question "Was suchen wir in der Bibel?", and he maintains that it should not be regarded as a record of history. The book contains a chronological table, a map of the ancient Near East, and indexes of names, subjects and both biblical and extra-biblical references. Each section is preceded by a list of relevant publications. Lemche's discussion of Israel's "Vorgeschichte" is valuable both for the information that it contains and for his discussion of the issues involved in evaluating the evidence. His opinion that the stories in the book of Genesis with their anachronisms are not to be regarded as historical (in the usually-understood sense) accounts of events in the Bronze Age will find wide agreement among O.T. scholars. Similarly, the difficulty of treating the stories of the exodus and the wilderness wanderings as history will be 574</page><page sequence="3">BOOK LIST 575 widely recognized, although many still believe that they have a stronger historical core than Lemche acknowledges. Yet more controversial are his arguments for dating the Pentateuch in the post-exilic period, especially late in that period. There are strong arguments for dating at least parts of it much earlier. Whatever may be thought of such questions, readers will value the book and find it interesting. To end on a lighter note, Scottish readers are unlikely to welcome the description of James Barr in the penultimate sentence of the book as "der englische Alttestamentler und Theologe". [J.A. EMERTON] Y. MAORI, The Peshitta Version of the Pentateuch and Early Jewish Exegesis (Hebrew). 408 pp. The Magnes Press, Jerusalem, 1995. $23. This book is based on Maori's dis- sertation at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which was noted in VT 27 (1977), p. 256. The published form differs from the original in that the treatment of a number of subjects has been expanded, and more recent publications have been taken into consideration. The chapter headings are listed in English as well as Hebrew, but the book lacks the English summary of the dissertation. A translation into English would be welcome. [J.A. EMERTON] E. TALSTRA (ed.), Computer Assisted Analysis of Biblical Texts. Applicatio, 7. vi + 173 pp. Free University Press, Amsterdam, 1989. NLG 75, ?36. The tenth anniversary of the Werkgroep Informatica, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, was made into an oppor- tunity for representatives of a number of research groups to meet and report on their work. This volume includes the text of the reports on VU Amsterdam (E. Talstra, F. Postma), Maredsous (R.-F. Poswick), Westminster Seminary, Philadelphia (J. Alan Groves), Jerusalem (E. Tov, B.A. Nieuwoudt), Bethel-Bielefeld (C. Hardmeier), and Tubingen (H. Schweizer), and a short response by H.M. Vroom which drew attention to the contribution of formalized computer-based research on the biblical text to reflection about hermeneutical questions. The volume provides a valuable progress report on projects which were under way in the late 1980s before the massive devel- opment of "computer Bibles" on microcomputers in the past few years provided the wished-for "scholar-friendly" tools that are now in widespread use.

Contributions to Biblical Exegesis and Theology 21. 271 pp. Uitgeverij Peeters, Leuven, 1997. BEF 1240. In his intro- duction, the editor stresses the importance of iconography in the study of religion in Israel and elsewhere in the ancient Near East rather than almost exclusive reliance on texts. He notes the view of some scholars that images of Yahweh were used in temples in Israel. The present book "offers... a representative and well-informed survey of the available data, both textual and archaeological, on the role of divine images in the biblical world" (p. 18). The articles are all in English. I. Cornelius surveys iconography in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia and Urartu, and Syria-Palestine. He finds five ways of representing a deity: "as an anthropomorphic being;... a theriomorphic being; ... a mixture of the two;... in inanimate form (by symbols such as a lightning fork or a weapon"); and "by a materially emphasized empty space" (pp. 41-2). Angelika Berlejung describes and discusses the Mesopotamian ritual of the mouth-washing of images "to establish perfect purity and to enable con- tact between the earthly and the divine worlds", after which the "image became 'charged' with positive powers" (p. 45). H. Niehr "collects and discusses the evidence for a YHWHi statue in the First Temple" (p. 74). He believes that, given the widespread use of cultic images in the ancient Near East, the onus of proof is on those who deny such use in Israel and Judah, and who are thus involved in difficulty in explaining some passages in the O.T. For example, in 1 Kings xii 28-9 "The calf, as YHWH'S divine image, is not only a pedestal for an invisible deity... but is itself a theriomorphic cult image" (p. 82). Further, Niehr holds that cultic statues of Yahweh were found in Jerusalem no less than in the Northern</page></plain_text>
