<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART FROM SIAM "The Arts of Thailand," an exhibition organized by Professor Bowie of Indiana University, under the auspices of the Government of Thailand* Sir John Bowring, who visited King Mongkut at Bangkok in I855, describes the antiquities and curiosities his august host had collected. The private apartments in the palace were "ornamented with beautiful pendules and watches, statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, fine specimens of Chinese porcelain, and other costly decorations"; while the Chapel Royal was "crowded with a great variety of costly and curious objects - statues from Europe, porcelain vases from China; many a strange lusus naturae, such as elephants' tusks of extraordinary shape and size; ancient garments worn by former kings; specimens of elaborately-carved ivory and wood; gold and silver ornaments, with jewellery in endless variety; many statues of Buddha, one of which is said to be of massive gold." (Bowring, The Kingdom and People of Siam, London, I857; I, 412; II, 279; other references at I, 410, and II, 324.) These collections were the original nucleus of the National Museum, which was formed after King Mongkut's death. One of his sons, Prince Damrong, turned over to it the magni- ficent collection of bronzes and stone sculpture he assembled during his long years as Minister of the Interior. The same prince organized a number of branch museums in the provinces, where objects discovered by the local authorities or unearthed by the Archeological Service would be deposited, and from which a selection would be transferred to Bangkok from time to time. The National Museum has grown steadily. Princes and private persons have made donations and bequests; the monasteries of the country have sent old lacquered cabinets, manu- scripts, paintings, and other antiquities; and some of the most important additions have come from excavations conducted by various archeologists, including Prince Damrong's son Prince Subhadradis, who is the present Curator. An impressive selection from the Bangkok Museum and its subsidiaries, to which have been added loans from monasteries and private collectors, is now being displayed in the United States. It will come as a revelation to most people who see it, for the West is hardly better acquainted with the arts of Siam today than it was with those of China and Japan a hundred years ago; and the examples of Siamese art most often seen in Europe and America are listless and prettified objects of recent vintage, some of which are mistaken for antiquities. This exhibition is quite different. When I saw it at Bloomington last September I found the experience deeply moving. Though I was already acquainted with most of the objects in it, it * Bloomington, Oct. 9 - Nov. 23, I960; Metropolitan Museum, N.Y., Jan. o - Feb. 19, 1961; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Mar. 12 - Apr. 23; Toledo Art Museum, May 14 - June i I; Los Angeles County Museum, July 9 - Aug. 3; Seattle Art Museum, Sept. o - Oct. 8; Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco, Nov. 5 -Dec. 17; Honolulu Academy of Art, Jan. 21 - Mar. 3, 1962.

Judicious lighting and the general absence of glass barriers allowed them to be clearly seen. And the fact that they were lifted out of their context enabled them to be judged with a fresh eye as works of art. We have learned, indeed, from the eloquent pages of the late Dr. Coomaraswamy that that is not the way we ought to judge images of the Buddha. Unlike much western art they demand more of the spectator than a feeling for form; to be fully appreciated they need to be under- stood. Otherwise looking at them, no matter how earnestly, will be like listening to a recital of poetry in a language we do not know. This is not the place for me to expound the idiom; I have tried in former numbers of Artibus Asiae and elsewhere to call attention to the traditions and the practices that make the art of the image-maker at once so peculiar and so compelling. In importance, though not in numbers, images of the Buddha naturally dominate the ex- hibition. Nothing could be less abstract than this sculpture - or less realistic. It is representa- tionalism of the most thoroughgoing kind; but it represents what the mind knows rather than what the eye has seen. It is not so much the formal qualities that make the masterpiece, re- markable as they may be; it is the perfect adaptation of the formal qualities to the high theme. The series begins with an 'aniconic portrait of the Buddha' (to use Coomaraswamy's apt phrase), a carved stone Wheel of the Doctrine. A little figure of the sun-god still clings to the symbol that was his before the Buddhists adopted it; and a gentle crouching deer, carved separately, evokes the park at Sarnath where the First Sermon was preached. This wheel, attributable to the 7th or 8th century, but recalling the symbols used in Indian art a thousand years earlier, exemplifies the deliberate archaism that inspires and re-inspires the sculpture of Siam throughout its long history. Anthropomorphic images of the Buddha were made in Siam as early as the 6th century, and perhaps earlier. The school of Dvaravati (6th-I3th) is represented by a serene standing figure, a beautiful head, and two bas-reliefs, all in stone; and by several bronzes and stuccoes, so few examples of which are ever seen outside of Siam. The Khmerizing school of Lopburi is excel- lently represented. On the other hand the selection from Sukhodaya, the greatest and most spiritual of the Tai schools, is, apart from a suavely-modeled I5th century standing figure, a disappointment: there is no indubitable specimen of the i4th century high classic; the seated figures, while adequate, lack fire; and the single example of that most extraordinary invention of Siamese art, the bronze walking Buddhas of Sukhodaya, is weakly conceived and uncertainly executed. Northern Siam, however, contributes a small walking Buddha of considerable charm, cast in 1482, and, in addition, several seated Buddhas, including a splendid figure wearing the royal attire, probably of slightly later date; and two good examples of the lion type (the so- called early Chieng Sen), one of which is dated by an inscription to the year I486, while the other I take to be a decade or two later, though most of my Siamese friends attribute it to the I2th or I3th century. The U Tong examples display the usual firm modeling and soldierly dignity of that school, which somehow maintained a generally hiigh standard in spite of its mass production methods. In all there are nearly 300 objects in the exhibition, including stone sculpture and bronzes, terra cotta and stucco, architectural fragments and models, paintings and illuminated manu- 130</page><page sequence="3">scripts, furniture and lacquerware, ceramics, silver, jewelry, ceremonials utensils, actors' masks and marionettes. I cannot refrain from mentioning some of the things that gave me the most pleasure. A fragment of Dvaravati architecture - an assemblage of pilasters and balconies, volutes and arches carved in stone - is an aerial palace, with well-fed godlings peering from the dormers to see what is going on below. Stucco reliefs of scenes from the Buddha's life must have been numerous in Dvaravati art, but only fragments remain; an exquisite torso of a divinity and some heads of gods and demons make us long for more. A mutilated stone figure from Sri Deb (9th century?) is clearly the work of a sculptor who had observed the human form with affection- ate care. A red sandstone relief, of the Lopburi school, shows us some exalted persons sitting in a pavilion, served by attendants. The Lopburi bronzes, especially the little shrines, the cere- monial utensils, and the chariot fittings, are dynamic in design and crisp in detail. A pair of bland Hindu divinities show an alien theme rendered in the lyrical bronze style of Sukhodaya. Nothing could be more delightful than the jewelry and the figures of real and mythical animals in various materials. The earthenware jars and pots in the Khmer taste are partly covered with a dark-brown drip glaze; the glazed decorated stonewares and celadon monochromes of Sukho- daya, Svargaloka and northern Siam recall the wares of Tz'u-chou and Lung-ch'tian; and the Chinese export-ware made to Siamese specifications is a curious counterpart to our own Lowe- stoft. The 19th century painting preserves an ancient tradition; and the paraphernalia of palace and monastery life are marked with a sure sense of design and scrupulous craftsmanship. The displays, covering a period of fourteen centuries, range in mood from intense religious fervor to unabashed mischief. Only one mood is lacking: there is no misery. If there is an oc- casional scene of violence it is too theatrical to disturb the most squeamish observer; the only martyrdoms are in temporary hells; and the highest religious theme is not crucifixion but enlightenment.
