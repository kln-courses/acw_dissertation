The hill as a whole has yielded abundant archaeological remains, and the specific excavations discussed here produced artefacts ranging in date from the Neolithic to Byzantine/modern periods, thus encompassing most of the vast time-range of human activity at Knossos. However, the two sites with which this study is concerned are principally deposits of Bronze Age material. The first site is certainly mortuary, and is conventionally referred to as the Monastiriako Kephali Tomb. It is located near the north-eastern edge of the hill's plateau and is clearly visible today as a large pit 12 m long N-s and 8 m E-w, with a depth of 8 m on the west side (figs. 1.2-1.3).1 After its initial, accidental discovery, the site was first tested in 1933, initially by a representative of the Greek Archaeological Service and then by Romilly Jenkins as the representative of the British School at Athens in the absence of the curator John Pendlebury (excavation code T.II. 1 ).2 Excavations at the site were then re-opened in 1935 by R.W. Hutchinson, who tested immediately to the south of the 1933 excavation area and retrieved a large mortuary assemblage (excavation code 1935/3). None of these excavations has been fully published, and even unpublished written records are very limited. No excavation records have been located; Jenkins wrote a report on the 1933 fieldwork, and Hutchinson also prepared a manuscript for publication on the 1935 excavations, but none of this material has proven possible to trace.3 The surviving archival material (principally correspondence) and several brief published descriptions state that MM III burials in larnakes and inverted pithoi were found in 1933, and that in 1935 several further MM III pithoi were discovered, as well as a MM IA burial stratum beneath, separated from the receptacle burials by an intervening sterile layer.4 More recently, Sinclair Hood re-examined the material from the 1933 and 1935 excavations held in the Stratigraphical Museum at Knossos, and proposed that there was in fact continuous use of the Tomb from MM IA to MM IIIB (and possibly LM IA), with much of the 1933 material actually belonging to MM II rather than MM III.5 One of the aims of the current analysis is to revisit this question of the Tomb's history of use. The second site, which will be referred to here as the Monastiriako Kephali Deposit, is located at the northern edge of the hill's plateau, roughly 65 m distant from the Tomb.6 Hutchinson excavated the site in 1935 (excavation codes 1935/2 and 1935/4). In this case too no excavation notes have been recovered and the site was never fully published, although a brief description in the Archaeological Reports for that year described it as a 'thick deposit of MM IIIB sherds and fragmentary stone bowls', with some LMI pottery and two sword pommels.7 Hood has also reassessed the material in the Stratigraphical Museum from this site, commenting that the ceramics were predominantly MM III-LMIA in date but also noting the presence of some MM IA, MM II, LM III and Hellenistic material.8 1 Hood and Smyth 1981, 45 no. 140. 2 Jenkins was a Student at the BSA from 1930 to 1934 (Mango 1970, 7). The minutes of the BSA's Managing Committee of 13th February 1934 include the following entry relating to the site's excavation: 'Knossos. Sir Arthur Evans reported that during the Curator's absence three M.M. tombs had been accidentally found, and were unscientifically excavated by the local authorities. The Director had sent over Mr. Jenkins, whose report with illustrations was on the table. Sir Arthur Evans submitted that his intention to lodge a strong protest would not be practicable, owing to the legal right of the ephors to excavate accidental finds. Agreed to authorise the Director to make an agreement with the authorities of a delimitation of the School's sphere at Knossos, such agree ment to be approved by Sir Arthur Evans before ratification.' (BSA archives: 'Managing Committee Minutes 1930-39': '19307-35'). 3 In a letter to Humfry Payne on 1 st February 1934, Arthur Evans acknowledged receipt of Jenkins' report (BSA Archives: 'Knossos Correspondence 1930-39': 'Correspondence 1934'); the Minutes of the BSA's Managing Committee of 13th February 1934 also note that Jenkins' report had been tabled at the meeting (see n. 2). Subsequently, in a letter to Myres on 15th February 1937, Hutchinson mentioned that he was preparing a collaborative publication of the 1933 and 1935 excavations with Jenkins for the Annual of the BSA (Ashmolean Museum archive). Two later letters from John Cook to Hutchinson, dated 6th May 1952 and 4th June 1952, and a report by Hutchinson in 1952 refer to revived publication preparations (BSA Archives: 'Knossos Correspondence 1940— 49': 'Knossos Publications 1952' and 'Knossos Publications 1952 Hutchinson'). 4 Marinatos 1934, 249; Karo 1935, 240-1; Payne 1935, 168; Hutchinson 1962, 166-9. 5 Hood and Smyth 1981, 45. 6 Hood and Smyth 1981, 44-5 no. 139. 7 Payne 1935. 8 Hood and Smyth 1981, 44-5.</page><page sequence="12">KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND DEPOSIT' 200m Acropolis Tomb Fig. 1.1 (above).

Views of the MK Tomb site in 2011 (courtesy ofT. Whitelaw): a) view from east; b) view from north. Hutchinson interpreted the site as a secondary deposit from a nearby settlement context, but Hood inclined rather to a mortuary interpretation on the basis of the Deposit's location. One aim of the current analysis is to assess the nature and function of this site, especially in relation to the nearby Tomb. The bulk of the material kept from the excavations at both sites is held at the Stratigraphical Museum (henceforth 'SM') at Knossos, and this dataset is the principal focus of the present study. Analyses of the principal categories of material from each site are presented separately below, followed by discussion of the sites' history and function in their broader Knossian context in the concluding chapter. A potential problem, however, must be noted at the outset: there are six ceramic vessels and possibly a stone vessel with fragments present in both Deposit and Tomb boxes (the latter all from the 1935 excavation; see Chapters 3 and 4). These joins are likely to be the result of accidental post-excavation mixing, rather than of any ancient re-deposition of material between the two sites. One of the labels of Tomb box FA 28, in which one of these vessels occurs, actually notes a possible admixture of material from the Deposit excavation (see Appendix A). Moreover, the sherd breaks on all six ceramic vessels are still sharp, with no signs of the abrasion which might accompany secondary transferral by human agency (and which would certainly be expected from movement through natural agency) between sites so far apart. Finally, as will be discussed further below (Chapters 3 and 5), most vessels from the upper Tomb levels and the Deposit are only partially represented in the SM collection, by a single sherd; given such low retrieval chances for most vessels anyway, the likelihood that sherds of as many as six vessels were recovered from both sites is very low. Further examples of post-excavation mixing are also identifiable. For example, two sherds in Deposit box FA 11 derive from other excavations altogether, since they are labelled 'Isopata' and '1937/4 13'respectively, while there are several further examples of sherds which appear to have been transferred between the Tomb and Deposit boxes (discussed below in Chapters 3 and 5). There also appear to be two instances of labelling confusion between Flutchinson's excavations at the Tomb and Deposit, excavations which appear to have taken place simultaneously (in March and April 1935, to judge by the dates given on the SM box labels). An early report by Hutchinson (see pp. 7 and 75) gives the Tomb excavation code as ' 1935/4' and the Deposit's as '1935/3' (while '1935/2' refers to a dump of Roman sarcophagi east of the Teke); however, in Hutchinson's 1935 excavation notebook the Deposit excavation was, as now, listed as '1935/4' and the Tomb as '1935/3'. Hood has also observed that one of the SM boxes originally labelled '1935/3' probably belongs instead to the Deposit site9 — this is now stored in the SM as Deposit box FA 12 (see Appendix B). However, despite these problems it is unlikely that post-excavation mixing of material across the boxes from the two sites has been so extensive that their study is compromised: FIG. 1.4 presents an overall 9 Hood and Smyth 1981, 44.</page><page sequence="14">KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' Ceramic phase 3° m 25 - 4&gt; 1/3 20 - ai &gt; 15 - © 10 5 - 0 4 ^ - s « s § s , Ceramic phase Fig. 1.4.

A large cutting 2 metres deep had been made on the east side of the original cave but this deeper part was absolutely barren except for 1 or 2 sherds that had apparently fallen from higher levels. The deeper half of the cave has not been cleared but it seems probable that the results of excavating it would shew it to be analogous to the central portion. The upper strata, level and contemporary with Mr Jenkins' graves, whereof they form an extension, contained one complete pithos burial and the remains of at least 2 others, all belonging to the MMIIIb period. The most interesting object from the MMIII strata was a rather battered head of a man in grey limestone, presumably broken from a statuette, though we found no other fragments of it. If the head be Minoan work it is certainly unique but it bears some resemblance to the head of the standing ivory boy from Palaikastro. A very finely cut obsidian core was also found in this stratum. Under the MMIII burials was a stratum of barren earth, evidently the collapsed roof of the MMI cave since below it were a few vases and a quantity of sherds all dating from the MMIa period. Associated with these was a pile of human skulls and bones but it was impossible to distinguish the bones of any particular skeleton. The pottery included the normal conical cups, beaked jugs, votive sheep-bells, a barbotine side-spouted jug, and a small amphora containing some balls of grey stone. We also have a shorter summary published by Hutchinson:2 In 1935 under Sir Arthur Evans's auspices and guidance (and at his expense) I opened a rock shelter on Monasteriako Kephali, the acropolis hill west of the Minoan city. It proved to be a continuation of the rock shelter previously tapped by R.J.H. Jenkins, who found Middle Minoan IIIpithos graves there. I also found remains of about three pithos graves of Middle Minoan III date and a considerable quantity of pottery of that period, but, underneath and separated from it by a sterile layer of fallen rock representing a collapsed roof, I found the remains of an ossuary of Middle Minoan I date with one complete skull, a number of crania, and plenty of bones. There was, however, no possibility of distinguishing between those of one skeleton and of another. The only known field record, in one of Hutchinson's notebooks, is probably a single day's entry of finds from the upper part of the Tomb, at 0-1.5 m depth (italics inserted):3 '1935/3 M.K. tomb 0-1.5 7 cup shapes [sketch of a ?conical cup added here] masses of bone 2 bits of crucible with bronze slag attached 12 bits of fresco mostly with plain red paint but 1 with straight black band bordered by yellow' Turning to the excavated finds, 42 boxes of material from the Tomb site are held in the SM, listed in Appendix A. Five of these boxes derive from the 1933 excavation (T.II. 1 : boxes 1683 to 1687); 36 derive from Hutchinson's 1935 excavation (1935/3: boxes FA 1 to 311, a box of bone material and two further boxes containing (respectively) a lead slingshot and a cast of the limestone figurine head found in the Tomb); the final box contains material collected by Hood in 1966.4 1 The typed document, which constitutes one of the series of reports made annually by the Knossos Curator to the Managing Committee, is held in the BSA Archives: 'Knossos Excavations 1920-1970': 'Knossos Excavation Reports 1935-49' : report entitled '??Archaeological work at Knossos in 1935??'. 2 Hutchinson 1962, 166. 3 BSA Archives: 'Knossos Notebook 292 Hutchinson'. 4 The contents of this box are not included in the present publication, but the author is very grateful to Sinclair Hood for his kind permission to examine them and confirm that they are consistent in nature with the material kept from the excavations.</page><page sequence="17">KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' f Mill * * Fig. 2.1.

Boxes FA 31 and 311 can be confidently attributed to the 1935/3 excavation despite the queries on their labels, because of joins found with other sherds from the same excavation elsewhere in the SM collection. A 1941 inventory by Hutchinson exists which includes a list of 34 boxes of material from his 1935/3 excavation. This can only be partly matched with the present-day 1935/3 boxes, as no box numbers are given in the inventory and only very brief descriptions are provided of the contents for only some boxes.5 However, 20 of the entries can be tentatively matched with specific present-day boxes, and the inventory also provides a limited amount of extra information about ceramic, stone and plaster artefacts from the Tomb which is incorporated into the discussion below where relevant. The material in the SM boxes consists predominantly of ceramic vessel sherds, and also includes faunal remains, stone artefacts, faience beads, plaster fragments, metallurgical debris and marine shells, as well as human remains. No single box can be matched with the specific assemblage from the upper level described in Hutchinson's notebook (above), although box FA 17 does correlate fairly closely: its contents include three crucible fragments and 15 flat pieces of plaster, most of which have red decoration; a further piece has a blue-black stripe and although no yellow is visible at its border, this may have faded. However, the plaster 'cones' in the same box (see Chapter 4) are not noted in Hutchinson's entry and, conversely, no pottery is stored in box FA 17. Overall, this suggests that the SM boxes do not represent the entire individual daily recovery or collection units. There is also further material from both excavations in the Tomb which is now stored in the Herakleion Museum; this will be brought into the discussion below where relevant but it has not been possible to study it as part of the present project.6 Marinatos noted that three pithoi were taken to the Museum in 1933,7 one of which is pictured among a set of 13 photographs of material from the 1933 excavation in the BSA Archives (FIG. 2.1 and Chapter 3).8 Other artefacts in these photographs which are no longer in the SM and thus were presumably also transferred to Herakleion, are a fragment of a clay figurine and possibly a seal (discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 respectively; figs. 3.27 and 4.4 a). Concerning the finds from the 1935 excavation, we have a list written by Hutchinson in 1939 of the antiquities in the Villa Ariadne, which was generated in preparation for potential transferral of material to the Herakleion Museum; among this material, Hutchinson notes 'Vases, bones etc. which I excavated from Middle Minoan graves on Monasteriako Kephali in 1935. These are unpublished but I have noted what I want and have told Plato that so far as I am concerned he can have as soon as I have numbered the individual vases'.9 Unfortunately, this material was not itemised; nor do we have a record of what was actually sent. That some material did go, however, is clear from later correspondence in which Hutchinson refers to the existence of pots from the Tomb in the Herakleion Museum.10 While it is not currently possible to ascertain the amount of material removed, such transfers usually involved whole ceramic vessels and other artefacts or other remains of particular value, rather than sherds. They probably include the pots and the obsidian core in three early photographs held in the BSA Archives (reproduced in FIGS. 2.2 2.4).11 The photographs themselves are unlabelled but two of the vessels within them (in FIGS. 2.2 and 2.4) are labelled with the excavation code '1935/3'. Neither of these specific pots is now in the SM collection, but other vessels in all three of the photographs are (as detailed in Chapter 3). The remaining objects in the pictures are probably also, therefore, from Monastiriako Kephali, although some may derive from the Deposit site rather than the Tomb (sherd / in fig. 2.4 is labelled with the excavation code '1935/2'). However, these photographs do not account for all of the exceptional artefacts noted by Hutchinson in his unpublished report: the 'barbotine side-spouted jug' and 'small amphora containing some balls of grey stone' are not represented here or in the SM collection (a photograph of the head of the limestone figurine was published by Hutchinson and Pendlebury elsewhere — see Chapter 4, S76). It appears from Hutchinson's unpublished report that the Tomb was not investigated in its entirety, and that the 'deeper half' remained unexcavated. It is also clear that Hutchinson considered its original form to have been, at least partially, an artificial construction, 5 Copy on file at BSA Knossos. 6 During the period of study, access to the Herakleion Museum accession books or collections was not possible, due to the re-building of the museum and re-development of the displays. 7 Marinatos 1934, 249. 8 BSA Archives: 'BSA Excavation Records: Knossos': 'KNO 2445': KNO PhA 5441-5453. 9 From a letter by R.

A pencil label on a late Prepalatial sherd of the strata which were encountered by Hutchinson and in box FA 3 — 'Al dromos north' — implies that his workmen in different parts of the Tomb, and/or to Hutchinson had identified the tomb's entrance, which inaccuracies in recorded measurements. It is difficult was presumably on the east side. In the top of the MK to pinpoint exactly how much of the site was excavated hill, which is formed from limestone, there are several in the 1935 season, but Hutchinson's unpublished report small rock-shelters on the northeast and west sides a mentions investigation of the eastern and central little below the crest of the slope, and it is not unlikely portions (and the unexcavated deeper part), while that the Tomb too was originally a natural rock shelter, the SM box labels show that there was also a separate though possibly adapted for mortuary purposes.

The lowest which FA 9 and 21 belong). The enigmatic codes stratum, representing the earliest phase of the Tomb, 'Al', 'A2', 'Bl' and 'B3', which occur on several of contained a 'pile' of disarticulated human remains and the box labels (FA 13, FA 15-17, FA 20 and FA 28), an associated assemblage of pottery and stone artefacts, may refer to specific areas within the Tomb, perhaps and was dated by Hutchinson to MM IA. This was in the eastern and central portions — they appear overlain by a sterile layer of earth, which Hutchinson not to be stratigraphical categories, at any rate, since believed had been formed by the collapse of the tomb they can occur in association with more than one roof. The second phase consisted of'strata' of MM III stratum (e.g. 'Bl' is mentioned in association with both receptacle burials above this roof-fall layer, presumably the 1 st and 3rd strata). in an open-air cemetery. Hutchinson noted the recovery If there were spatial variations in the stratigraphie of several pithoi here which he considered to be sequence in different areas of the Tomb, this may also contemporary with the larnax and pithos burials found help to explain why a number of the SM box labels refer at the same site in 1933. to strata by other names still, or to no stratum at all. For Within the SM collection from the 1935 excavation, example, boxes FA 11 and FA 23 are assigned to the three numbered strata are mentioned on a number of 'MM III stratum' and FA 12 to the 'MM III A stratum', the box labels, though none mentions the sterile layer which might suggest that in some parts of the Tomb only of roof-collapse (see Appendix A). Five boxes belong one upper level of receptacle burials could be to the '3rd', or 'MM IA', stratum: FA 1, FA 2, FA 4, distinguished or that it was unclear which of the FA 8 and the Bones box. Two boxes belong to the '2nd' numbered strata the context correlated with. It should stratum: FA 9 and FA 22; and 11 belong to the '1st', or also be noted that box FA 23's label states that its 'upper', stratum: FA 10, FA 14-19 and FA 24-27. The material was 'Associated with pot containing small 3rd stratum clearly correlates with the first phase of stone balls'; however, the 'small amphora containing the Tomb's use as described in Hutchinson's reports: some balls of grey stone' referred to in Hutchinson's the MM IA level of disarticulated burials below the unpublished report (and which is presumably the same collapsed roof. Regarding the second phase of the Tomb, vessel) is there assigned to the MM IA stratum. These Hutchinson's unpublished account explicitly refers to conflicting dates perhaps suggest some ambiguity as to 'strata' of MM III pithos burials, rather than to a single which stratum this box's material actually derived from, level, and these may encompass both the 1 st and 2nd or confusion at the time or later, during post-excavation strata on the SM box labels. However, it should be noted analysis. The labels on the remaining boxes for 1935/3 that while the labels of several lst-stratum boxes do mention no stratum at all, although several record include the date 'MM III' in their descriptions, those depths, and one (FA 7) is specifically dated MM III. of the two 2nd-stratum boxes do not. These indications of a rather more complex The 3rd stratum seems to have been at 1-2 m below stratigraphy than is revealed by Hutchinson's reports a benchmark depth of 3 m: this is based on information (or may have been recognised during excavation) are on the exterior and interior labels of box FA 4, although, supported when we turn to look at the excavated unfortunately, they are now only partially legible (see material itself. Most of the SM boxes contain material Appendix A). In particular, one of the exterior side covering a broad date range. No box contains an labels of the box records a context of'3rd stratum (1- assemblage which is confidently datable to a single 2 below 3 m)'; moreover, in Hutchinson's 1941 ceramic phase (with the possible exception of FA 14, inventory of the SM boxes, the entry which apparently whose only datable vessel is a LM IA pithos — C359), correlates with box FA 4 is assigned a depth 'below 3 and there is no clear pattern of early material being m'). The material in the 2nd-stratum box FA 22 derived confined to the 3rd stratum boxes and of later material from 1-2 m depth from the surface. However, the depths being confined to boxes assigned to the 2nd, 1 st and given for the 1 st-stratum boxes overlap with box FA 22 general 'MM III' strata; there are also numerous and also vary among themselves (0-1.5 m for FA 17 ceramic sherd joins between boxes.

These inconsistencies possible explanations for the fact that the SM ceramic</page><page sequence="21">12 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' material presents a more confusing picture than as well.

It is likely that both of these processes have limited amount of such mixing has taken place between occurred to some extent; this issue will be revisited the Tomb and Deposit boxes, and this is no less in the analyses below, likely to have occurred within the corpus for each site</page><page sequence="22">3 The Monastiriako Kephali Tomb: the ceramic material and stratigraphy INTRODUCTION Approximately 3400 ceramic sherds are stored in the SM from the 1933 and 1935 excavations of the Tomb. The vast majority are Bronze Age, with one earlier sherd (Neolithic) and 43 post-Bronze Age (Geometric to Byzantine/modern). Some post-excavation analysis of the material had already been undertaken before the present project commenced, as a number of vessels from both the 1933 and 1935 excavations had been at least partially reconstructed. Hutchinson records in his annual reports that he was working on the material from the 1935 excavation over the next two years at least, and several of the vessels were labelled with their context or excavation code and, in some cases, catalogue numbers (presumably for Hutchinson's intended publication of the Tomb). It is not known what criteria were employed for the retention or discard of material during and after the excavations in either season. Fine, medium-fine, medium-coarse and coarse sherds are all present in the SM boxes but we cannot be sure that their ratios are representative of all the material originally recovered. There is certainly a predominance of sherds that are either diagnostic of shape or decorated, which is unlikely to be representative of the original assemblages. Where plain body sherds are present, they are often refittable with other sherds, and it therefore seems likely that many of them were kept solely for this reason, having been found in close proximity to other parts of the same vessels, which were recognised by the excavators as being at least partially reconstructable. The present analysis is based principally on a catalogue of the Bronze Age ceramic material in the SM, compiled for the purpose of this study. The catalogue, set out below, comprises those objects whose shape is recognisable from diagnostic features and which are datable within one ortwo ceramic phases (e.g. 'EM III or MM IA'). Dates are assigned to the vessels on stylistic grounds only, according to the ceramic phases with which they are typically associated; context has not been used as a supplementary criterion for dating (i.e. dates given on the box labels or inferred from other vessels in the same box) as it was observed early in the analysis that many of the boxes had ceramic assemblages covering a broad date range.1 The catalogue comprises 362 objects (C1-C362), almost all of which are vessels, and it represents 36% of all the Bronze Age sherds in the SM boxes. The uncatalogued Bronze Age material appears to fall within the general time period represented by the catalogued objects, although it was not datable with the same degree of precision. Among this uncatalogued material, several specific vessel shapes occur which are not represented at all in the catalogue because of dating difficulties; these will be highlighted and briefly discussed below (see also table 3.1). The remaining uncatalogued material, which is not included in the present study, therefore comprises two categories: a) sherds of vessels whose specific form is not identifiable, and b) sherds assignable to vessel forms which are represented in the catalogue, but which are not precisely datable in these specific instances. Most of the pots which were intact or almost intact when excavated were probably transferred to the Herakleion Museum, and those remaining in the SM collection are mainly conical cups. Early photographs of MK material (reproduced as FIGS. 2.1-2.4; see Chapter 2) include a number of well-preserved vessels which have presumably been moved to the Herakleion Museum, as they are no longer within the SM collection. These vessels are included in the discussion below where relevant; they are not catalogued, but since intact vessels constituted a small minority of the recovered material, they are unlikely to significantly affect assessments of vessel type representation in the overall assemblage. As noted in Chapter 1, there are sherds of six ceramic vessels which join with fragments stored in the Deposit boxes. One of these vessels has been catalogued below (C69 — a rounded cup), since the Tomb boxes contributed the majority of the extant sherds (one of which is also labelled with the Tomb's excavation code, '1935/3'). A further vessel has been catalogued with the Deposit material (Chapter 5: C401 — a pedestalled bowl), since the Deposit boxes produced the majority of its composite sherds. The four uncatalogued vessels are a jug (in Tomb box FA 20 and Deposit box FA 8), a bowl (in Tomb box FA 28 and Deposit box FA 4), an ovoid pithos (in Tomb boxes FA 5 and FA 31 and Deposit box FA 8) and a tripod basin (in Tomb boxes FA 5 and FA 31 and Deposit box FA 8; fig. 3.31 b). Importantly, this has also been observed for the bone material in the Bones box assigned to the 3rd stratum; see Chapter 4.</page><page sequence="23">14 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT ' The jug is datable to MM IIB or III A but has not been catalogued since it cannot be allocated to either the Tomb or the Deposit (as there is one component sherd in each collection). The bowl, which also has one sherd in each collection, is difficult to date with precision. The ovoid pithos and tripod basin do appear to belong to the Tomb since a greater number of their component sherds are in this collection, but they are not datable with sufficient precision to be included in the catalogue.

Large spouted jars are tall amphorae with a short tubular spout in the upper body or an everted rim-spout, decorated with dark-on-light trickle 63 Hood et al. 1959, 253-61. 64 Muhly 1992, 102 no. 113, 142. 65 PM 11,235.</page><page sequence="46">THE TOMB: THE CERA MIC MA TERIAL AND STRA TIGRAPHY 3 7 w 10 centimetres Fig. 3.28.

Fragments of nine examples were found among the SM boxes (FIG. 3.29); parallels occur in late Prepalatial and early Protopalatial settlement contexts.66 Incense burners and braziers also comprise minor categories among the SM material, with two and five examples respectively (fig. 3.29). The chronological development of cooking wares at Knossos is not yet well documented, partly due to a selective preference for fine wares in early excavation publications. There are sherds (usually rims and upper bodies) from 25 deep-bodied coarse-ware cooking pots (fig. 3.30); also present are sherds from 30 shallow plates and basins: coarse or medium-coarse vessels with flat bases, slightly raised edges or low vertical sides and, in some cases, tripod feet (FIG. 3.31). Fabric colours in both the deep-bodied and shallower cooking vessels range from red-brown to orange. The final category comprises tub larnakes, which were used as burial receptacles.

There are no identifiable larnax fragments among the SM material from the 1933 excavation, but the preliminary reports imply that at least one larnax was recovered during that season.67 DISCUSSION The earliest use of the Tomb was in the late Prepalatial period, although there are fragments of two earlier vessels among the 1935/3 material. The first is a Neolithic sherd: part of a bowl handle with burnished surface. It has worn edges and was found in the highest level of the tomb, at 0-1.5 m depth from the surface (box FA 13), and is undoubtedly intrusive. The second is the stem of an EM IIA stemmed goblet (CI), comprised of three joining sherds. The sherd breaks are fairly worn, especially at both ends of the stem, and the other catalogued material in the same box (FA 30) ranges in date from EM III or MM IA to MM IIA. The absence of any further identifiable EM II sherds in the SM boxes suggests that this is an isolated example and there is no reason to think it represents mortuary use of the Tomb at such an early date. By contrast, at least 105 (29%) of the catalogued objects from the Tomb belong to EM III or MM IA, and this large corpus can plausibly be interpreted as representing the earliest use of the Tomb. Two further late Prepalatial footed goblets, a single and a double sheepbell, a globular jar, four side-spouted jars and three beaked jugs are pictured in early photographs of MK material from Hutchinson's 1935 excavations, but are no longer in the SM collection and have presumably been transferred to Herakleion Museum (FIG. 2.2 a-d,f i, m; fig. 2.3 c,f-g, i-j); these vessels probably derive from the Tomb rather than the Deposit, given their good state of preservation. Almost all of the catalogued late Prepalatial vessels are fine-ware drinking or pouring shapes, which suggests that the consumption and/or offering of liquids or food were important elements of the mortuary rituals here, and medium-coarse and coarse-ware vessels associated with consumption may also have been deposited in this period (see the discussion of uncatalogued artefact types above). The most common open shape is the footed goblet, followed by one-handled cups (rounded, straight-sided or carinated), footless goblets and a single 'goblet' of unique shape (C103), while the pouring shapes comprise beaked jugs, bridge-spouted jars and side-spouted jars. The function of'sheepbells' is unclear, and they are probably best considered as figurines rather than as vessels.68 Hutchinson's unpublished report (see p. 7) mentioned the presence of 'conical cups, beaked jugs, votive sheep-bells' in the 3rd stratum, which is consistent with the catalogued Prepalatial material (the 'conical cups' presumably referring to footed and footless goblets). The one handled cups are not mentioned, however; and conversely, neither of the specific vessels which Hutchinson notes (the barbotine side-spouted jug and small amphora) is now in the SM. The MM IA date assigned by Hutchinson to the earliest burials in the Tomb may well be correct. However, we should note the possibility that burials actually commenced in the preceding phase, EM III. This dating issue is problematic partly because few late Prepalatial deposits at Knossos have so far been published and they vary in the reliability of their stratigraphie contexts and assemblage representation (due to selectivity in the retention of excavated artefacts). In recent years there have been shifts and disagreements in the dating of several of these deposits;69 the present analysis follows, in most respects, the deposit dates and the most recent typological framework for late Prepalatial ceramics outlined by Marinatos 1934, 249. See Morris and Peatfield 1990 for further discussion. E.g. Momigliano 1991, 152 and Cadogan et al. 1993, 25 for the Royal Road South Basements Lower Floor; Momigliano 1991 passim, MacGillivray 1998, 90-3 and Momigliano 2007, 95-6 for the Monolithic Pillar Basement lowest level, House B upper floor and House C floor deposits.</page><page sequence="50">THE TOMB: THE CERAMIC MATERIAL AND STRATIGRAPHY 41 Momigliano.70 However, although Momigliano draws a distinction between Early and Late EM III at Knossos, there are too few deposits of the earlier phase to allow its detailed characterisation,71 and EM III will therefore be treated as a single ceramic phase in the present study. MM IA is also retained as a single ceramic phase without demonstrable chronological subdivisions, as advocated by Momigliano. In general, Knossian fine wares show strong continuity between EM III and MM IA in fabrics, forming techniques, shapes and decoration. The principal feature which distinguishes MM IA assemblages is the regular appearance of polychrome decoration—specifically, white and orange 'geometric ' motifs on a dark slip — and the appearance of carinated and straight profiles on one-handled cups.72 These features do occur in a minority of the late Prepalatial vessels from the Tomb, indicating that burial activity did take place in MM IA; however, most of the ceramics could be assigned stylistically to either MM IA or EM III. Moreover, given that the skeletal remains in the lowest stratum were found mixed and in secondary context (see also Chapter 4), it was probably difficult or impossible at the time of excavation to distinguish any individual assemblages, which might have helped to distinguish between definite MM IA interments and those which were possibly earlier. Detailed comparison of the overall late Prepalatial corpus in the Tomb with contemporary settlement deposits at Knossos is hampered by problems reconstructing the entire original assemblages in both cases, but some general observations and comparisons can nevertheless be made. The typical fine and semi fine wares known from the settlement deposits — Polychrome, Dark-on-Light, Light-on-Dark, Plain and Monochrome — are all present in the Tomb, usually in the buff, orange or pink fabric classified by Momigliano as Type I,73 although some examples of the greenish Type II fabric also occur (e.g. C5, C61). Vessel shapes and decoration also share general similarities with settlement material. The footed goblets, which are the most common form in the Tomb by a significant margin, are fairly standardised in shape, with conical bodies and flattened or upturned feet predominating (Momigliano's type 3). They show a strong preference for light-on-dark over dark-on-light decoration (the latter accounting for only three of the 52 catalogued vessels), with the typical external band applied below the rim, though two uncatalogued vessels no longer in the SM collection (FIGS. 2.2 d and 2.3 i) are more elaborate, with spiralling and vertical wavy lines in Light-on-Dark or Polychrome Ware.74 The dark on-light splatter decoration on three rounded cups (C66-C68) and a side-spouted jar presumably also from the Tomb (FIG. 2.2 b) appears to be rare as yet in the settlement; indeed, contemporary parallels are known from very few sites on Crete. Haggis suggests that this decoration is particularly characteristic of the Siteia valley in MM I—II;75 the MK Tomb examples do seem consistent with the local fabric, although a further, uncatalogued bridge-spouted or side-spouted jar of MM I date from the Tomb with splatter decoration on its interior is in a different, possibly non-local fabric (fine clay, grey at the core and pink-red at the surface, with added buff slip) (fig. 3.7). The goblet C103 also seems to lack settlement parallels. Conversely, the fine ware shallow bowls found in the Upper East Well Deposit, dated by Momigliano to EM III Late, are not present in the Tomb.76 In terms of mortuary parallels for the Tomb in the late Prepalatial period, there are as yet no other known burials of such an early date at Knossos, in the valley or associated with the harbour town to the north. The nearest mortuary material with which this late Prepalatial assemblage can be compared is at Archanes Phourni, where a number of tombs and open-air deposits of this era have been excavated. All of the ceramic shapes which are attested twice or more at MK are also present at Phourni, although there is greater overall variety in vessel forms and decoration at the latter, as might be expected at a site with a considerably larger body of material.77 The major difference between the MK Tomb and the Phourni cemetery lies rather in burial receptacles, as these were apparently not used at the Knossian site, whereas pithoi and larnakes were both popular forms of primary and secondary interment at Phourni.78 Moving into the Protopalatial period, the MM IB material from the Tomb comprises similar drinking and pouring shapes to the late Prepalatial vessels. As well as the 30 vessels catalogued above (C110-C139) there is, among the photographed MK material no longer in the SM, a footless goblet (fig. 2.2 h)\ a cup with light on-dark and barbotine decoration which may be MM IA or MM IB (fig. 2.3 h), and a short-rimmed carinated cup with crinkled rim which may be MM IB or MM 70 Momigliano 2007. 71 Although Momigliano does suggest certain characteristic features, such as a predominance of Light-on-Dark Ware, and the presence of footed goblets, footless goblets and jugs with more globular shapes than are generally found in EM III Late deposits. 72 Momigliano notes that the very few polychrome pieces which do occur in EM III settlement deposits seem to be non-local products, which strengthens the association of the production of this ware at Knossos with the MM IA phase (2007, 84, 87, 91). 73 Momigliano 1991, 245. 74 Cf.

MM IB ceramics at Knossos are broadly characterised by the frequent use of the potter's wheel, and in the catalogue above, goblets and cups of MM I type have been classified stylistically as MM IB if wheelmade rather than handmade. It should be noted that this is not always a diagnostic feature since some use of rotation techniques occurred in the late Prepalatial phases (for example, many of the Prepalatial footed goblets in the Tomb appear to have wheel-turned feet), while many vessels continue to be handmade into the palatial period.79 However, the footed goblets assigned in the catalogue to the early Protopalatial phases (MM IB and/or MM IIA) do show marked differences from the late Prepalatial examples: as well as having wheel-formed bodies, their profiles tend to be more squat and less conical than the late Prepalatial goblets, and their dark slip covers the whole interior and all or most of the exterior of the vessel. Pouring vessels continued to be handmade in MM IB, and individual examples of MM I type in the Tomb have been assigned to MM IB if their profiles are sharply carinated rather than rounded. The Tomb vessels confidently datable to MM IIA (C159-C168) are far fewer than the MM IB corpus, but again include mainly drinking and pouring shapes: cups, saucers and a side-spouted jar. Unfortunately in the case of the footed goblet - the most common early Protopalatial vessel type in the Tomb (as in the late Prepalatial period) — it is usually not possible to date individual vessels to either MM IB or MM IIA on stylistic grounds alone.80 As a result, C140-C154 can only be dated to 'MM IB or MM IIA', though two others (CI 14 and CI 15) have been dated more specifically to MM IB on the basis of their orange and white banded decoration.81 As in the Prepalatial period, we have little in the way of mortuary parallels at Knossos with which to compare the MK assemblage of the MM IB and MM IIA phases. It appears on present evidence that the Ailias cemetery was established in MM IB, as Tomb I contained burials of this early phase, apparently in pithoi,82 though the majority of the cemetery is MM II—III in date; the earliest assemblages at Mavrospelio are MM IIB. The use of the MK Tomb site from MM IIB to LM IA involved interments in receptacles (though not necessarily exclusively). As noted above, the few tub larnakes in the SM collection cannot be dated precisely, but 21 pithoi have been included in the catalogue above (CI 84, C185, C280-C283, C302-C315, C359), which date from MM IIB to LM IA.83 Further uncatalogued pithoi recovered from the excavations should also be noted here as they will be relevant to calculations of the number of burials in the Tomb (Chapter 6). According to the early reports, three pithoi from the 1933 excavation were taken to Herakleion Museum; one of these was photographed by Pendlebury (fig. 2.1). Collectively, these pithoi were described as being 'decorated with white rosettes and other late MM motifs' and were dated by Karo to MM IIIB. However, the rosette motif could be earlier (the conical pithos CI84 with rosette decoration can be dated to MM IIB), and the conical pithos in fig. 2.1, which is decorated with spirals and a leafy band, is probably MM IIIA in date. This latter vessel displays similar fabric, morpho logical features, surface treatment and decorative motifs to a pithos from Aitania.84 Turning to the 1935 excavation, there are fragments of 10 uncatalogued pithoi among the SM material.85 It is likely that one or more complete pithoi were also recovered in 1935, since the early reports repeatedly mention that several pithos burials were unearthed: Payne mentions four; Karo notes one well-preserved pithos grave and the remains of at least two others; and Hutchinson reports 'one complete pithos burial and the remains of at least two others' in his unpublished report, and 'about three pithos graves' in his discussion of the site in Prehistoric Crete}6 As none of the pithoi in the SM from the 1935 excavation is intact, it is likely that at least one of these vessels has been removed to Herakleion Museum. A partially preserved pithos lid of probable Neopalatial date, also shown in one of the early photographs of 1935 MK material, may also derive from the Tomb (FIG. 2.3 b); it too is no longer in the SM collection. Within the SM corpus, there are greater numbers of recognisably MM IIB and IIIA than of later Neopalatial ceramics, which may suggest a lower level of activity in the Tomb in these later phases (for example, there are few sherds with characteristic LMIA spiral or reed 79 Macdonald and Knappett 2007, 41-5; Momigliano 2007, 83-4. 80 Momigliano 1990,483-6; MacGillivray 1998,66; 2007,125 6; Macdonald and Knappett 2007, 25. 81 This banded decoration is associated with MM IB at the latest in the Knossian Protopalatial settlement deposits examined by Macdonald and Knappett (2007, 46). Macdonald notes elsewhere that 'perhaps some very few polychrome, conical examples' of footed goblets may occur in MM IIA (2010, 203) but it appears that they would have been exceptional. 82 Platon 1950, 533; Hood 2010, 161. 83 In both the 1933 and 1935 excavations, pithoi appear to have been found inverted over the bodies. See Marinatos 1934, 249 for the pithoi discovered in 1933. A letter from Arthur Evans to Humfry Payne on 3rd April 1935 mentions that an 'MM III pithos' was found 'upside down in situ' in the 1935 excavation, although no details are given regarding the other pithoi (BSA Archives: 'Knossos Correspondence 1930-39': 'Correspondence 1935'). 84 Andreadaki-Vlasaki et al. 2008, 43 fig. 22. I am greatly indebted to K. Christakis for this information. 85 Six are conical: in boxes FA 6, FA 8, FA 18, FA 27 (two examples) and FA 31. One is ovoid (in box FA 9), one piriform (in box FA 28), and two are of uncertain shape (in boxes FA 19 and FA 22). 86 Payne 1935, 168; Karo 1935, 240; Hutchinson 1962, 166.</page><page sequence="52">THE TOMB: THE CERAMIC MATERIAL AND STRATIGRAPHY 43 Table 3 .2: Post-Bronze Age ceramic vessels in the Tomb boxes (all information courtesy of Peter Callaghan).

The MM II III vessels depicted in the early photographs of MK material but no longer held in the SM (fig. 2.2 j, I and o; fig. 2.3 e) are consistent with these shapes. As also noted above for the earlier phases of the Tomb, some of the uncatalogued medium-coarse and coarse ware vessels associated with cooking, consumption and lighting may also belong to these phases. The function of the pedestalled bowls, which also occur frequently, is uncertain. Among the 'minority' shapes are several hand lamps (the chronology of these vessels is not well understood, unfortunately, and for those included in the catalogue, the dates assigned are based on published parallels) and probably some of the figurines. There are a number of other known Knossian cemeteries in the MM IIB-LMIA phases, although few have been published in detail. Our best MM IIB evidence derives from the burial pit in Mavrospelio Tomb XVII, where a secondary deposit, sealed by pithos fragments, includes shapes similar to those of MK (particularly saucers, angular cups, a bridge-spouted jar, flat-rimmed juglets and plates).88 MM III pottery is present in much greater abundance in the cemetery, particularly in Tombs V-VII, IX and XVII, and at a number of other certain and possible funerary locations, particularly Gypsades, Ailias and Poros.89 All of these general cemetery areas continued in use into LM IA. Although only a limited number of the tombs have been fully published, their assemblages again appear to be similar to the material from the MK Tomb, including straight-sided cups, conical cups, saucers, ledge rimmed saucers, flat-rimmed jugs, spouted jugs, oval mouthed amphorae and hand lamps.90 There is no certainly identifiable LM IB material in the Tomb, and mortuary activity may have ceased by this point (indeed, this is a phase for which there is a general dearth of mortuary data from the Knossos valley).91 One or two LM III sherds are present among the Tomb material, though they do not derive from vessel types exclusively associated with mortuary activity (by contrast with the Deposit material; see Chapter 5).92 The post-Bronze Age vessels range in date from Geometric to Byzantine/modern sherds (table 3.2); no vessel was recovered complete and most are represented by one or two sherds only. Hutchinson's 1941 inventory of the 1935/3 boxes also mentions a 'classical figurine' from a box assigned to the upper stratum, while a further figurine fragment of an animal head in FA box 1 may also be post-Bronze Age. 87 Muhly 1992. 88 Forsdyke 1927,278-82,294 fig. 48,295, pi. 23; Alberti 2001, 174-6. 89 Preston 2013. 90 Cf.

There is some LM IB continuity in tomb use at neighbouring Poros (e.g. Muhly 1992 for Tomb 111967), though this too may have been limited. 92 See also Chapter 4 for discussion of potential LM III activity at the site.</page><page sequence="53">44 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND DEPO, T' Table 3.3: Chronological range of the datable ceramics in the Tomb boxes (black shading indicates definite presence; grey shading indicates possible presence).

The stratigraphy of the site is not straightforward to reconstruct, due to the lack of detailed excavation records, the ambiguity of many of the box labels and the broad date-ranges of the material within most of the boxes (table 3.3), although it is heartening to observe that in the detailed breakdown of the numbers of catalogued ceramics to which each SM box contributed sherds (fig. 3.33), Prepalatial material occurs more frequently in boxes labelled as belonging to the 3rd stratum than in those associated with the upper strata, and the situation reverses for material of MM II onwards. There is undoubtedly a good deal of overlap, however. Post-excavation mixing of sherds between boxes is probably contributing to this complexity, though pre-excavation (ancient) activity may also be responsible, as discussed below. Almost all of the Prepalatial material within the Tomb derives from the 1935 rather than the 1933 excavation, which is consistent with the early reports for both seasons, according to which only Hutchinson reached the earliest Tomb level. Seven Prepalatial vessels are marked with the inked label '1935/3 3rd' (C62, C66, C69, C75, C77, C96 and C105);93 presumably, this indicates that they were considered to have derived from the 3rd, 'MM IA' stratum described by Hutchinson, although only three of them have component sherds in boxes whose labels allocate them to this level (C69, C96, CI05). All of the boxes labelled as deriving from the 3rd stratum do contain late Prepalatial material (table 3.3). Significant quantities of Prepalatial material also occur in boxes FA 3 and FA 30 (fig. 3.33 a and b). However, the references to the 'surface' on the interior and exterior labels of box FA 3 are not easy to reconcile with the 3rd stratum. The labels of box FA 30 refer to an enigmatic context of 'burnt earth', which may have been associated with that noted on the interior label of box FA 8; moreover, two of the vessels with the post-excavation label '1935 3rd' (C77 and C105) have composite sherds in box FA 30. However, in Hutchinson's 1941 inventory a box assigned to the context 'Tombs burnt earth' is dated 'MM I?', which suggests that at the time of the excavation it was not straightforward to correlate this context with the more definite MM I level found elsewhere in the Tomb. A notable characteristic of the catalogued Prepalatial ceramic vessels is that most are represented by more than one sherd (FIG. 3.34) — although none is entirely reconstructable. A significant number of the catalogued MM IB vessels also share this characteristic. By contrast, the vast majority of the objects confidently assignable to MM II and later phases are represented by a single sherd, and it is rare for the multiple-sherd vessels to have more than three component fragments present in the SM collection (the few exceptions are usually pithoi, but also include several cups and medium-sized vessels — an amphora, pedestalled bowl and pyxis). Some of the single-sherd vessels from these later phases are largely complete and unbroken anyway, but they are mainly the more robust, thick-walled small vessels such as conical cups; for the majority, only a small proportion of the vessel is represented by the single sherd in the collection. This pattern indicates a striking difference between the recovery of objects belonging to the EM III-MM IB phases on the one hand, and to MM II-LM IA on the other. The precise placement of the dividing line between MM IB and MM IIA activities in the Tomb is rendered slightly ambiguous by the significant number of catalogued vessels which could belong to either of these phases (C140-C158), but the general distinction drawn between the earlier and the later material from the Tomb is nevertheless valid. This distinction may be a result of post-depositional processes. Hutchinson described the lowest stratum of the Tomb as having been crushed by roof collapse, which was probably responsible for the breakage of much of the assemblage in this stratum, as well as helping (to some extent) to preserve it from later disturbance. Those vessels which were then left crushed in this stratum were probably recognisable to the excavators as reconstructable artefacts, and their sherds (including non-diagnostic body sherds) therefore collected more assiduously. By contrast, vessels associated with the receptacle burials in the later levels may have been broken and scattered as new burial pits were created, so that by the time of excavation they were not seen as reconstructable pots and only diagnostic sherds were collected. If this interpretation is correct, it implies that much of the MM IB material was sealed with the late Prepalatial assemblages in the lowest stratum of the Tomb, thus extending the date-range for this stratum into the early Protopalatial era.94 It also suggests that disturbance of the later (MM II-LM IA) material represented by the upper levels was substantial: since we might expect feature sherds to have been retained by the excavators, the fact that the number of post-excavation joins for these phases is so low suggests that many sherds had been dispersed beyond the excavated area. 93 An eighth, uncatalogued closed vessel in box FA 22 with the same label is probably also Late Prepalatial in date (a probable beaked jug, in Polychrome Ware). 94 The MM IB carinated cup C121, which is almost entirely reconstructable, has an ink label on its base which is now partially illegible but may originally have read '1935/3 3rd'. If so, this would locate it in the 3rd stratum along with the other eight vessels with the same label, seven of which are certainly Late Prepalatial (see above).</page><page sequence="55">46 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' o Z 50 45 40 35 - 30 - 25 20 - 15 - 10 5 0 i &lt;&lt;M&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;U1&lt;&lt; ^ &lt; &lt; ™ £ ^ &lt; n □ = □ &lt; u. □ Key: Box numbers are given above each bar Dotted: 1935/3 boxes labelled '3rd' or 'MM IA' stratum Striped: 1935/3 boxes labelled '2nd' stratum Black: 1935/3 boxes labelled '1st' stratum Grey: 1933 boxes or 1935/3 boxes labelled 'MM III' or 'MM IIIA' stratum White: other boxes Fig. 3.33 (above, opposite and following page).

There is no through the layer of roof-collapse into the lowest burial exclusive link between the boxes assigned to a single stratum, which would have introduced later sherds to stratum (e.g. 3rd-stratum boxes do not only have cross this lowest level and churned up some fragments from joins with each other). Some 'vertical' stratigraphical the earliest assemblages into the upper levels. To some links may be discernible — for example, there are extent, therefore, the mixed dates of the ceramics in multiple joins between boxes FA 22 of the 2nd stratum, the SM boxes may be due to ancient activities, although, FA 4 of the 3rd stratum and FA 18 and FA 19 of the 1 st as noted above, post-excavation mixing is an equally stratum, and these boxes may therefore represent plausible explanation. Still later activities in the area different levels in the same area of the tomb. There are in the later Bronze Age and post-Bronze Age may also several objects with sherds in both the 1933 and 1935 have intruded upon the various layers of the Tomb; collections; however, this may be due to post-excavation however, the relatively small number of LM III and mixing as it is not clear why boxes FA 8, FA 29 and FA post-Bronze Age sherds present in the SM collection 31 from the 1935 excavation should show a particular suggests that this was not a major factor in the creation link to the 1933 material (especially as FA 8 derives of this complex stratigraphical record. Also, the from the 3rd stratum); conversely, no joins were survival of effectively intact inverted pithoi in the upper observed between the 1933 material and Hutchinson's level (as found in the 1933 excavation) suggests that boxes FA 6, FA 9 and FA 21, whose labels associate any such post-LM IA disturbance at the site was them with the area adjacent to the 1933 excavation, minimal or quite restricted.</page><page sequence="63">4 The Monastiriako Kephali Tomb: the non-ceramic material THE STONE VASES AND WORKED STONE Introduction As explained elsewhere in the volume, the finds are assigned to two broad contexts — inside the Tomb, and in the Deposit to the north, which the excavators characterised as a 'dump'. This last term is ominous, with its implications of confusion and potentially problematic stratigraphy. Reference to Chapter 1 above will show that internal joins between the two excavations are slight, with but half a dozen instances known. This phenomenon has been put down as most probably due to confusion occurring post-excavation. The single instance known in the stone material, (conical rhyton, S47), will thus be interpreted in the same way, and the apparent link between the two locales held to be of no significance. Of course, this does mean that the piece in question cannot properly be assigned a home: in the opinion of the author, however, the unfinished and broken nature of the piece would be placed better in the Deposit to the north. For the stone items, generally, any made up of joining fragments are relatively rare: two apiece for the Tomb (SI 1, S49) and the Deposit (S21, S35). In each case here the connection was made from within the same SM box, and so assumed excavated unit. The Tomb material comprises two subgroups: from the 1933 and 1935 excavations respectively. The first, and smaller, portion in terms of stone finds constitutes items S68-S74 in the catalogue below; the remainder of the catalogue entries derive from the 1935 excavation.1 Overall, stone finds are few at the Tomb site: some score of items all told. Of the material excavated in 1935, two stone vase fragments (Sll and S49) were found in the uppermost (or '1st') stratum (with pottery ranging from late Prepalatial to Neopalatial); with a further vase (S28) and a ?tool (S59) at a depth of some 1.60 m, possibly within the 2nd stratum (again with late Prepalatial to Neopalatial ceramics). The stone head (S76) and the obsidian core (S77) were described by Hutchinson as deriving from the upper, MM III level in the Tomb, with the receptacle burials. At a depth of 3 m, there are two further vase pieces (S24, S39) and a decorated slab (S64); their boxes (FA 5 and FA 6) contain late Prepalatial to post-Bronze Age ceramics, and the likely disturbed nature of the tomb is further affirmed by the fact that the slab also looks to be post-Bronze Age. Some confusion exists regarding the stone balls (S75), which may belong to either the lowest level or an upper stratum (see also Section II. 1 above). Equally, the stone vase fragments S40, S4 and S12 are of uncertain context, as box FA 28 appears to have an admixture of material from the Deposit (see Chapter 1). No internal stratigraphical details are known for the 1933 excavation (five vases: S68-S72; two tools: S73 and S74).

Discussion Stone Vessels The tomb yielded 13 or so vases: a Bird's Nest Bowl (S4), four indeterminate bowls (Sil, S12; S68 and S69), likely bucket-jars (S24, S28), lamps (S39, S40), a lid (S70), a tumbler (S71), a chalice (S72) and some nameless wall-pieces (S49) that are not here discussed. Can it be assumed at the outset that the catalogued pieces do represent once whole vases employed in/at the burial site? Here it will be so understood, but without strict justification. Of the bowls, the Bird's Nest variety (MSV 3;3 S4; FIG. 4.1) is represented by that with a small size and a low raised collar or rim (it would have had a moulded base too): this form is quite numerous in the Minoan corpus, has strong connections with the Mesara tholoi and a likely MM I date. The use here of a marble is 2 Hutchinson 1962, pl. 14a; Pendlebury 1939, 121, pl. 20.3. 3 Warren 1969, 11.</page><page sequence="67">THE TOMB: THE NON-CERAMIC MA TERIAL 5 9 also in keeping with the tendency at this early period to experiment with many stone types and patternings. Such vases also turn up at Knossos and in the broader north coastal zone, quite often being re-used in later contexts. Such a recycling may be the case here, as its location in the upper part of the tomb could indicate: even so, it could yet have been divorced from an original and earlier association with the lowest deposits in the cave, which are of an appropriately early MM date. Lack of determining features means that the other bowls (Sil, S12; S68 and S69; figs. 4.1 and4.2)4 can be broadly defined as just and only that. Sll and S12 have a rim diameter in the low 20s cm; S68 may be considerably broader: at some 48 cm across and with a steeper angled side than many. S12 is rather thin-walled. Of the next most commonly represented group amongst the Monastiriako corpus, namely the bucket jar (fig. 4.1 ),5 only a couple (S24, S28) may be found in the cave. A potential confusion with spouted bowls will always remain in those fragmentary cases, where both the defining bridge-spout of the bucket-jar is missing and the profile surviving does not distinguish between the more vertical one of the bucket-jars and the more inclined ones of the bowls. S24 is a good case in point. This would be one of the larger set within this form, whilst S28 represents a smaller (see below); the latter also tapers quite sharply to the base. As a form, the bucket-jar is widespread throughout the island and in time (MM I-LM I), with a floruit in the Neopalatial period. It is more a domestic item. Generally of serpentinite, the Monastiriako group conforms to the expected picture; S24 though is of a Neogene limestone. Of potential lamps (MSV 24;6 fig. 4.1), S39 should be kindred to the canonical pedestalled form, to judge from the general lines of the fragment preserved, but with somewhat heavier proportions; S40, with its ovoid base, could belong to those with the horizontal stick handles. All told, these are most likely to be broadly Neopalatial in manufacture; they are common all over the island. 570 is a typical lid (MSV 27;7 fig. 4.2), flanged on the underside, and probably once equipped with a central knob- or pawn-handle. Such are found throughout the whole period the craft was practised. This one is of reasonable size, at some 26 cm across, and made from serpentinite: two factors that in combination probably ensure that it belongs to MM III-LM I. 571 is here designated as a tumbler (ajar in Warren's terminology — MSV 21;8 FIG. 4.2). There is just the outside chance that it could have been a Miniature Amphora (MSV 28),9 though it seems a little heavy and large for such. If this second identification were accepted, it would provide another example at Monastiriako of a Mesara-related vase dating to EM III to MM I/II. S72, though but a small basal fragment, is by virtue of its distinctive profile immediately recognisable as a chalice (MSV 15;10 fig. 4.2). These are ritual vases of Neopalatial date, generally found in Crete in elite houses and Palaces throughout the island. Banded stones are not uncommonly chosen. For comments on techniques of production and problems of dating, see the joint discussion of the Tomb and Deposit material in Chapter 5 below. Stone Tools and Objects Numbering seven in total, this is a mixed group. About the vaguely possible tool (S59) and the missing stone balls (S75) nothing more is here said in detail. The first, S59, and S64, an unusual ornamental slab, are both now broken. Their locations in the tomb have a degree of stratigraphical detail: the latter was from a depth of 3 m, the tool from 1.6 m. Since it is hard to see the slab as of Bronze-Age date, its presence at such a low depth serves as a reminder on the parlous state of the stratigraphy involved therein. Involved too are a stone head (S76: here represented by a plaster copy)11 and an obsidian core of some magnificence (S77). None have much in the way of safe strati graphical associations (see the catalogue entries). Also added are two celts/Neolithic axes (S73 and S74; studied by Strasser),12 recovered from the 'MM Pithos Burials' dug in 1933. S64 (FIG. 4.3) is obviously an object with a purpose. The marble was first cut and worked into a slab of uniform thickness. The one surviving edge is bevelled to the reverse: a typical configuration when some such is intended as a veneer, or destined to be fitted together with other pieces into a composite whole. The point of this piece lies in the pattern cut into its upper face: though, being but a fragment, the scheme is irresolvable. From its nature and the marble quality employed, the object is likely to be Hellenistic, Roman or later in date; no parallels have been sought by the author. The sculpted head (S76) was located in the tomb by Hutchinson.13 Rather worn and battered, it has lost its mouth and chin completely.

At the Stratigraphical Museum in Knossos, though, a plaster cast of it has been found: its coarseness of reproduction does not assist in producing any sensible remarks (beyond its size). Probably the most distinctive features are the treatment of the eyes and the somewhat squared and block-like form of the whole head. Pendlebury likens it to a figure from a temple at Khafaje, which he dates to the mid 3rd millennium.14 Summarising the remarks reported in Hutchinson, one can observe that the experts of the day held somewhat contrary positions. To Frankfort, like Pendlebury, it was 'distinctly Sumerian'; he too compared it to Early Dynastic sculpture of the mid-3rd millennium BC.15 To Mallowan, however, it was 'certainly not Sumerian, but probably an archaic work from North Syria'.16 Hutchinson prefers to detect influence from the orient, perhaps Syria: but whether removed from there or produced locally in Crete under the influence of something Syrian is not clear. Given this variance of opinions, and the fact that the head has not been recently handled or described, it is sensible to leave the matter in abeyance — until those with the appropriate experience can study it anew. But at least a consistent Mesopotamian thread may be detected in earlier views. Obsidian and Celts The obsidian core, S77, on the other hand, has a more interpretable significance, even though nothing is known of this other than a photograph (fig. 2.4 e) and a line in an unpublished report by Hutchinson (BSA Archives; see Chapter 2). This is yet enough. The telling factor is its size. At 12.5 cm in length, this core is placed firmly in that class which shows Cycladic character istics, as opposed to their Cretan contemporaries, which scarcely ever get beyond 7 or so cm in length, and mostly are closer to 5 cm.17 The recognition here then of an off-island import or influence from the Cyclades will add another example of such contacts which are now found scattered along the north coast of the island. They are generally EM I and II in date, so far as the obsidian finds are concerned. Does this hint at a still earlier occupation or activity in this burial cave, as also suggested by the EM II goblet (CI, Chapter 3)? The two celts (FIG. 4.3) (in box 1684) are associated in that they were recovered in the 193 3 excavation. They are fairly typical of the sort in size, shape and material, though neither strictly is a functioning axe. One indeed is termed an adze (S73). The other (S74) is designated as either a hammerstone or a celt whose cutting edge was in the process of being re-sharpened. When re sharpening a celt one might have to grind the cutting edge flat to erase any vertical cracks that would cause the whole tool to break upon further use. Consequently, it is impossible to tell whether or not this last is a hammer-stone. These items traditionally have been termed 'Neolithic', but there is a strong suspicion they carry on being manufactured into EM; certainly they turn up in later contexts all over Crete. Thus their presence here cannot be used to suggest or deny a presence earlier than MM I in the tomb (see the obsidian core S77 above), though leaving the possibility open. D. E. THE SEAL S78 Seal, lentoid with rounded edges; string-hole horizontal. Serpentine, almost black with beige-coloured inclusions of a softer material (FIG. 4.4). D. 1.44-1.52, Th. 0.53, SH 0.23. Worn and slightly battered; engraving workshop fresh. A female figure, summarily rendered, in left profile with the upper part of the body shown frontally; both forearms, bent at the elbow; are raised. Neither hands nor feet are depicted; the head is a large featureless blob. The figure appears to wear a long divided skirt, but there are no clear indications of clothing on the upper body. Three dots in a triangular pattern in front of the figure; three further dots behind, between which is a diagonal line.

As this volume was being prepared, a photograph of the seal came to light in the Archives of the British School at Athens, evidently taken by J. D. S. Pendlebury and labelled by him 'Knossos MM III Tombs Acropolis Hill' (fig. 4.4 a). As indicated above (Chapters 1 and 2) there are no surviving records of the initial 1933 excavation by R. J. H. Jenkins, and only summary reports by R. W. Hutchinson exist, compiled after his subsequent investigation of the tomb in 1935. There is no mention of this seal in any of this meagre documentation. Thus Pendlebury's photograph provides the sole evidence for the association of this seal with the Tomb. Unlike other finds from the excavations, the seal was seemingly not retained in the SM, nor sent to the Herakleion Museum. In 1958 a description of the seal appeared in Cachets minoens de la Collection Giamalakis, accompanied by a photograph of the impression.18 The author of the catalogue was a niece by marriage of the collection's owner, Dr Stylianos Giamalakis, an Herakleion physician, who from the 1930s onwards had amassed a sizeable collection of seals and other antiquities. The catalogue was compiled in the 1950s prior to the acquisition of the collection by the Greek state in 1962, following the death of Dr Giamalakis. Thus the possibility that the seal had entered the museum following the Monastiriako Kephali excavations in the 1930s only to be misplaced and wrongly assigned to the Giamalakis Collection 14 Pendlebury 1939, 121. 15 Hutchinson 1962, 166. 16 Hutchinson 1962, 169, fn. 1. 17 Carter 1998, 69-70. 18 Xenaki-Sakellariou 1958, 60 no. 366, pi. 37.</page><page sequence="69">THE TOMB: THE NON-CERAMIC MA TERIAL 61 Fig. 4.4.

It was thoroughly documented by the CMS team in the early 1990s, to whom I am most grateful for permission to reproduce images published in CMS III (FIG. 4.4 b-d). A comparison of Pendlebury's photograph (FIG. 4.4 a) with that taken by Ingo Pini for the CMS volume (FIG. 4.4 b) shows that we not dealing with two seals depicting a similar motif, but one and the same piece, where tiny impurities in the stone match exactly, e.g. on and near the upper left edge behind the figure's shoulder and on the right edge immediately in front of her raised hand. Any differences in appearance are accounted for by the superior photographic equipment and lighting conditions employed by Pini.19 How and when the MK seal came into the Giamalakis Collection is a matter for speculation. Conceivably the seal was a chance find by one of the workmen, perhaps in the vicinity of the Tomb, following the 1933 excavations. If so we may be dealing with a case of 'finder's keepers'. At least Pendlebury was able to photograph the seal and evidently felt sufficiently convinced by any information about find-spot to attribute it to the MK tomb. Subsequently the seal may have passed through several hands before being acquired by Giamalakis, either through purchase or in lieu of payment for medical treatment. But while many of the Giamalakis seals have a 'provenance' (e.g. 'Mallia', 'Knossos') the MK seal does not, conceivably indicative of a serendipitous route to the collection. While the loss of concrete contextual information is regrettable, this is an ail-too common occurrence in the field of Aegean glyptic. For LB A Crete, seals from excavated contexts account for no more than 35% of 19 I am grateful to Laura Preston for sending me a scan of Pendlebury's photograh of the MK seal, which I swiftly recognised as being identical to CMS III no. 348, and for inviting me to contribute to this report. The initial identification was confirmed by superimposing enlarged scans from the CMS Archive on the Pendlebury image (with the contrast slightly enhanced, as shown in FIG. 4.4 a). Ingo Pini concurred with the identification, writing by email (30.5.11): 'There is not the slightest doubt that the seal of which you sent me a scan is identical with CMS III no. 348.'

And many seals were evidently chance losses in antiquity or suffered later disturbance and looting, whether ancient or modern. Insofar as possible, we must attempt to restore all such lost souls to their rightful 'context' apropos glyptic output and the wider social milieu in which they used. The MK lentoid belongs to a sizeable group of seals produced during the Neopalatial period in soft local stones.21 Choice of material varied somewhat over time: steatite, which had dominated output during MM II, in particular for three-sided prisms,22 was largely supplanted by serpentine and schist in the Late Minoan period.23 But patterns of exploitation remain obscure, in part due to imprecise or downright inaccurate identifications in the past.24 To be fair, identifying materials accurately is not easy in the case of small seals with engraved faces, sometimes subjected to long periods of use or depositional vagaries, resulting in abraded surfaces, worn string-holes and battered edges. The material of the MK seal has been identified by the CMS team as dark serpentine, almost black in colour with light 'speckles', essentially inclusions or impurities of a softer material.25 Ordinarily this is steatite or talc. But even among serpentine seals from secure Knossian contexts there is much variety in colour and appearance. These might reflect different sources, though there can also be variations from one outcrop to another within a relatively small area. The motif depicts a female figure in left profile with the upper part of the body rendered frontally, a pose well attested in LM I glyptic. Her shoulders are broad and upper arms well developed; the arms are bent at the elbow and the forearms are raised. These are treated more sketchily, especially her left forearm, indicated by a series of three or four uneven cuts. Indeed a summary treatment applies to all individual elements. Her head is a somewhat irregular featureless blob, inclined slightly to the left. Faint traces of a neck seem visible in the impression, but are not shown in the CMS drawing. Breasts are not indicated and there are no definite signs of clothing on the upper body; but the narrow waist and divided skirt leave no doubt that the figure is indeed female. Either side of the figure are groups of three neatly executed dots arranged in triangular patterns: left two dots above, one below; right one dot above, two below. Here a rather broad line runs diagonally from the upper dot. This might just be construed as a summarily rendered plant-motif,26 those in front as rock-like elements, but the latter seems unlikely given the decidedly regular juxta position of the dots. The dots would have been produced with a hand-held drill; knives and burins used for executing other elements. The pose of the female figure demands further comment. The seal has been grouped by Pini with other representations on soft stone lentoids depicting single female figures with one raised arm, often regarded as 'adorants'.27 In fact, as I have argued elsewhere, within Pini's group there exists considerable variation in pose and gesture.28 To a certain extent our ability to evaluate these is linked to quality of execution, which among the soft stone repertoire varies from rather poor to extremely careful. Insights can occasionally be gleaned from comparisons with the female figures depicted in cult scenes on gold signet rings. But even here certainty often eludes us. 'Gestures of adoration' are easiest to identify when figures are rendered wholly in profile: where we clearly see one arm raised, the other usually stretched out behind.29 But in other instances feet and head are shown in profile, whereas torso, arms, lower body are shown frontally or in three-quarter view and there is reason to doubt that a 'gesture of adoration' is actually shown. Conceivably we might be dealing with dancing figures or even depictions of the Potnia.30 Whatever the precise symbolism, our seal probably belongs in this category. Figures shown frontally with upraised arms, whether alone or flanked by animals, might well depict the Potnia.31 Among the various sub groups the female figures are sometimes accompanied by stars or rudimentary indications of rocks and/or 20 Krzyszkowska 2011, 439. 21 I have estimated that roughly 25% of output during LMI was in soft local stones (Krzyszkowska 2005, 124; cf. Krzyszkowska 2012, 740 for LM IB sealing deposits). The CMS database (now available on the internet at http:// www.arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal) may permit us to determine the proportion more accurately, though absolute exactitude is impossible given uncertainties in dating. This applies especially to soft stone seals, which may be so badly abraded that only a broad LM date is feasible. 22 Anastasiadou 2011; Krzyszkowska 2005, 92-5. 23 Müller 2007, 17-21. 24 Krzyszkowska 2010a, 256-7. 25 Xenaki-Sakellariou ( 1958,60) called the stone 'steatite' along with many others now re-identified as serpentine or schist by the CMS team. 26 So regarded by Xenaki-Sakellariou 1958, 60. 27 Pini 2010, 332-3, fig. 9. 28 Krzyszkowska 2012, 744—5. 29 Single figures; CMS III nos. 351-352.

With a vertical string-hole the motif is best appreciated when the seal is worn on a bracelet, as are modern wrist-watches. A horizontal string-hole is ideal for suspension on a necklace, and this may well have applied to some of the exceptionally large hard stone seals depicting the PotniaTheron. Was this also the case with the smaller soft stone lentoids depicting females, or were they worn on the wrist?35 The question is not merely one of idle curiosity as it brings us to a crucial point about all soft stone seals, including those depicting female figures. The elaborate banding and veining of many hard semi-precious stones actually obscures motifs on the original seals, and motifs are best appreciated in impression. By contrast the devices on soft stone seals are immediately legible from the original, unless the seal has become badly abraded. That some are exceptionally well engraved and bear unusual or innovative motifs suggests that soft stone seals should not ipso facto be dismissed as inferior products. But beyond that it is hard to proceed. We have no means of judging whether they belonged to a particular social class or group, and whether imagery could be freely chosen or was in some way restricted. What we can observe is that among soft stone seals bearing representations of females, alone or with animals, there is a marked concentration in the Knossos area.36 The fact that another seal belonging to this broad group can now be pinned down to a mortuary context the Monastiriako Kephali hill at Knossos is a happy circumstance indeed. That the seal was only slightly abraded and the engraving 'workshop fresh' is wholly consistent with the possibility that it may have accompanied one of the latest interments in the MK tomb, which was in use until LM IA.37 O. K. THE FAUNAL MATERIAL Among finds from MK currently stored at the SM were fourteen complete or fragmentary animal bones. All, apart from one, derived from boxes supposedly containing material from the Tomb. In view of debates on the role of meat consumption in funerary feasts38 and the extreme scarcity of adequately published data for animal bone assemblages from Minoan funerary contexts, presentation of even this extremely modest assemblage was considered necessary and potentially informative. Before proceeding, however, it should be noted that, as with all other groups of material from MK, paucity of excavation records, post-depositional disturbance and post-excavation mixing (see Chapter 2) render interpretation problematic and impose extreme caution in drawing inferences from the study of this assemblage. The presence of only one specimen in box FA 5 (.Specimen 1, table 4.1) containing ceramic and other material from the Deposit, suggests that animal bones, if present, were not systematically recovered, or at least kept, not surprising for the time when the excavation was undertaken.39 Comparatively more specimens were contained in MK Tomb boxes. The following discussion will concentrate on the latter material. Faunal material preserved in MK Tomb boxes can be divided into two groups. Group 1 consists of 32 Rrzyszkowska 20106, 180-1; 2012, 744-5. 33 Convenient illustrations of bird-ladies and females + goats appear in Pini 2010, figs. 5-6 and 11, respectively; see also Rrzyszkowska 2012, 743—4, pis. CLXXVa-c and CLXXVIe for further examples of females + animals. Among the rare exceptions to the horizontal string-hole 'rule' are CMS II.3, no. 169; IX no. 164 (diagonal) and VI no. 287 (vertical). The fine bifacial lentoid HMS 2815 from the Stratigraphical Museum extension site depicting a female figure in rocky terrain also has a vertical string-hole; it depicts a running deer on face b, which may have determined string-hole direction. See Rrzyszkowska 20106, 180, fig. 17.12a. 34 Goats rendered in the so-called 'talismanic' style prevalent in hard stone engraving during MM III-LM I form a striking exception, being regularly provided with horizontal string holes. The reason is unclear, but may reflect a (slightly) earlier fashion of wearing seals. 35 If the latter, then the issue of orientation arises: was the motif to be appreciated chiefly by the wearer or by others? Younger (1977, 148, 156-9) argued that where seals were worn did not matter, as they were carved from attractive materials (but this pertains chiefly to hard semi-precious stones) and that engraved faces were turned in to the flesh to protect the motifs from wear (but the very few depictions of seal-wearing do not provide conclusive evidence). 36 See Rrzyszkowska 2012, 741 ff for detailed discussion with provisos on 'provenances' and brief mention of unpublished examples from the Royal Road and other excavated contexts at Rnossos. 37 Cf. the soft stone lentoid depicting two female 'adorants' from one of the Poros tombs (Dimopoulou-Rethemiotaki 2004, 373, fig. 31.20) though contextual information is not yet available. 38 E.g. Hamilakis 1998. 39 Systematic collection of animal bones was essentially introduced at Rnossos by Hood who resumed excavations in the 1950s. Evans himself does not appear to have been interested in the recovery of animal bones: they are extremely rare in SM boxes with material from his work at the site, while animals are discussed rarely in PM and in very specific contexts relating mainly to games and ritual (Isaakidou 2005).</page><page sequence="72">64 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT ' Table 4.1 : List of animal bones from MK Tomb and Deposit (* see Appendices A and B for more details; highlighted specimens articulate).

If funerary feasts had taken place, in which meat was regularly and ostentatiously consumed and remains were buried within the tomb or in its vicinity, we might have expected a larger bone assemblage and perhaps more body parts from fewer individual animals.40 Therefore it is not unlikely that this material is intrusive and not connected with mortuary activity. Hence, these remains cannot be used to support deposition of either meat offerings or remains of funerary feasts at MK and are silent as regards the practice of funerary feasting. Group 2 bones (Specimens 7-14) tell a different, though not more easily decipherable story. According to preserved contextual information, this group, currently stored in a box with human bones, derives from the 3rd or 'MM IA' burial stratum. Only two species are represented: cattle and donkey (the latter based on available measurements — table 4.2). The specimens identified as donkey are, potentially, the most interesting of all the faunal material examined from MK. Three out of five are complete and two of these (,Specimens 10-11) are certainly articulating: they are of comparable size, their articulations match and they display comparable pathological conditions on their proximal articular surfaces (fig. 4.5). The distal radius (Specimen 9) displays a similar lesion and so probably belonged to the same individual. Moreover, all donkey bones are of a size compatible with their belonging to the same individual. Finally, butchery marks, observed on Specimen 10 and compatible with cutting for the purpose of skinning the animal, could identify this group of bones as tomb offerings, rather than a dead animal buried at a later date and thus unconnected with mortuary activity. So far, there have been no published reports of similar finds from funerary contexts of this period. Indeed, no physical remains of any equids from closely dated Prepalatial contexts are known. Horse teeth ('dei denti di cavallo') are reported by Banti from Tholos A at Ayia Triada, but their precise date is uncertain, as ceramics in the tomb span EM I-MM II.41 The potential importance of the MK finds, combined with the uncertainty of their date, made direct dating essential. Two samples from Specimens 9 and 1 0 were submitted to ORAU (Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit)42 for AMS dating. The sample obtained from Specimen 9 did not yield a date, due to poor collagen preservation, but that from Specimen 10 (OxA-24885) yielded a date between the early 13th and mid 11th c. cal. BC (FIG. 4.6). The implications of the date are manifold. First, since no sherds of this period were identified in the ceramics boxes assigned to the 3rd, or 'MM IA' stratum of the Tomb, the presence of the bones in this box is arguably a result of mixing during or since excavation. More perplexingly, the Tomb appears to have been in use only until LMIA (see Chapter 3 and table 3.3), though some later material, including a few LM III sherds, was identified in SM boxes. Therefore, on present evidence, these bones cannot be associated with funerary activity in the tomb. Given evidence for post excavation 'movement' of ceramic material between Deposit and Tomb boxes, it is not entirely implausible that the donkey bones had the same fate. On the other hand, evidence for ritual handling and deposition of 40 The presence among retained human remains of human phalanges, some of the smallest skeletal elements and thus those most prone to loss through poor recovery, may be an argument for relatively careful recovery of bones, including animal bones. 41 Banti 1933, 216. 42 We would like to thank the Knossos Donated Fund for generously funding dating of this material.</page><page sequence="74">66 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' Fig. 4.5.

Whether deposited in ritual or mundane circum stances, the donkey bones also shed a little welcome light on the role played by this species in LM Crete.

This demonstration of what many would take for granted is welcome, given increasing evidence for structured deposition and ritualised treatment of both donkeys and horses in the LBA of the southern Aegean.46 The evidence for skinning of the MK donkey is also of interest, although butchery marks on donkey bones, suggesting removal of meat and/or marrow, are reported from Tiryns on the southern mainland47 and Kastanas in northern Greece.48 V I. OTHER MATERIALS A small number of objects in other materials (faience, plaster, shell and metal) from the Tomb excavations are stored in the SM. A selection of them has been catalogued; the remainder are discussed briefly below. Catalogued material 01 Spherical bead with central hole. Faience. Complete. D. max. 1.6, of hole 0.3. Box FA 5, in a brown envelope labelled: '1935/3 Box 353 Bead' (in blue ink). 02 Spherical bead with central hole. Faience. Almost complete, though much of the surface eroded away. D. max. 1.65, of hole 0.35. Box FA 22A, in a brown envelope labelled: '1935/3 Faience Bead' (in blue ink) and '232' (in pencil). 03 Crucible fragments (3; 2 joining). From base and side of a large, bowl-like item. 9.75 x 6.9; Th. 3.5 at base, to about 2 on side. Fine buff clay (no obvious inclusions or vegetal impressions). Inside, the surface has been reduced to a slaggy state (up to 1 cm thick, but mostly much less), copper pieces and prills remain, corroded green; exterior is clean, hand-modelled and wiped; it has no signs of heat having been applied. Shape not really possible to deduce: but nothing to prevent it having been hemispherical. This may correspond to the two crucible fragments recorded in Flutchinson's excavation notebook as deriving from a depth of 0 1.5 m (see Chapter 2; box FA 17, in which this crucible is held, is also attributed to 0-1.5 m depth); if so, one of the fragments then fractured into two pieces after the excavation. Box FA 17. 04 Conch shell, fragment of mouth (lip of aperture, and part of body). L. pres. 9.4; Fit pres. 4.1;Th. wall 0.1-0.3. Natural white of shell; some beige concretion on outside. Worked: once part of vessel/trumpet. The naturally serrated edge of the mouth opening has been emphasised by a hand-cut groove (well under 1 mm wide and deep), worked 1-2 mm below it: visible on both inside and out. Box 1687. FIG. 4.7. 05 Slingshot, ovoid. Complete. Lead, one side slightly corroded. L. 3.4; W. 1.7; Th. 1.2;Wt31 gm. Moulded, seam along sides visible. Low-relief trident takes up most of one side: very angular form. If any inscription on the other, no longer visible. Box with front label: 'Knossos Area SF. Inscriptions Amphora Stamps'; within small cigarette box with date '31.3.35' and other details on. Said to be from 'Taphoi Bl', in mixed MM stratum. On the basis of the box label, and a note within Flutchinson's 1941 list of the SM boxes for this site, it appears that Flutchinson originally speculated that the inscribed trident was a Linear A sign. Discussion The faience beads (Ol and 02), which derive from the 1935 excavation, are stored in boxes FA 5 and FA Fig. 4.7. Worked conch shell (04) (Tomb): a) exterior view; b) interior view. 22A: neither box is associated with a specific stratum, but depths are given on the box labels (3 m and 1.6 m respectively). Also from the 1935 excavation are three fragments from a crucible (03), which will be published in more detail elsewhere by R. Doonan.49 It is noteworthy that there is a parallel for the occurrence of such an artefact in a Knossian MM mortuary context, in the fill of Upper Gypsades Tomb XVIII.50 The worked conch shell (04; fig. 4.7) was recovered in the 1933 excavation; it is one of several marine shells found in the Tomb (see below), but the only piece which has been modified. The lead slingshot (05) has nothing to do with the Bronze Age deposits. As with the later pottery and the engraved stone slab (S64; see Chapter 3 and above p. 57, respectively), its presence amongst the Bronze Age material merely underlines the degree of mixing that had taken place in the Tomb material, in antiquity or more recently. It is by definition most probably Hellenistic. Similar pieces illustrated in on-line antiquities sites, and others specifically Cretan as collected by Kelly,51 show that many had an image in low relief on one side, and some inscription on the other. 46 Pappi and Isaakidou in press. 47 von den Driesch and Boessneck 1990. 48 Becker 1986. 49 The authors would like to thank Dr Roger Doonan for examining this material. 50 Hood et al. 1959, 223, 253 no.

On the preserved side, it bears a trident (used by the Cretan city-state of Rhaukos on its coins, up to its destruction in 166-5 BC; and also by Phalasarna). It is perhaps more likely though that this symbol was here employed for its connotations of power and impact, as is the thunderbolt on other Cretan slingshots from Trypetos and Aptera. In fact, most of the signs illustrated make reference to lethal stings (snake, scorpion, bee), to speed in the air (comet) or both (javelin). Uncatalogued material A number of boxes from the 1935 excavation contain plaster fragments: FA 5 (three pieces), FA 14 (three pieces), FA 16 (three pieces), FA 17 (22 pieces), FA 23 (two pieces), FA 24 (two pieces) and FA 26 (one piece). The fragments in most of the boxes, which have traces of red and/or blue-black monochrome or stripes on their flat surface, are too small to identify the objects from which they derived. However, box FA 17 contains seven 'cones' as well as 15 flat fragments: four with faint traces of blue-black decoration and 11 with red, including one rim. At least some of this material (in particular, the cones and rim) appears to derive from at least three 'tripod hearths', similar to vessels found in the MM IIB settlement assemblage of the 'KV trial' at Knossos, which there comprised clay plates coated with plaster and attached to cone feet.52 Box FA 17 is labelled as deriving from the upper stratum, which suggests the association of these plaster vessels with receptacle burials in the second phase of the Tomb's use (within MM II to LM IA; see Chapters 2 and 3). Several unmodified marine shells are present among the SM material, most of which are complete or almost complete. Two are bivalves: one spondylus in box FA 5 and one area in FA 31. The remainder are gastropods: five murex in boxes FA 23, FA 24, FA 27 and 1687 (two shells).53 Most of the shells are stored in boxes specifically associated with either the 'upper stratum' or an MM III context (no shells are present in boxes associated with the 3rd stratum), suggesting that shell deposition was particularly associated with the second (receptacle burial) phase of the Tomb's use. Knossian parallels for unmodified marine shells in mortuary contexts occur in the Mavrospelio cemetery, in Tombs VII, XV and XX, but in mixed or LM III contexts.54 L. P. and D. E. THE HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS Introduction The human skeletal remains analysed in the report below represent a sample of those excavated from the Tomb in 1935. Archival evidence indicates that the skeletal material from the excavation was studied in 1936 by Robert W. Ehrich of the Peabody Museum, and the skulls were again examined in 1938 by Michael Rix, though the whereabouts of any reports produced are unknown.55 Some of the skeletal material may then have been transferred to Herakleion Museum in 1939 (see Chapter 2). The main focus of this report is the SM Bones box, containing three bags of bone material labelled 'MM IA', which were presumably excavated from the lowest stratum of the tomb by Hutchinson (see Appendix A) — though caution must be exercised over the reliability of this context, given the later date of faunal material also stored in this box (see pp. 63-7). In his published and unpublished reports Hutchinson describes the human bones from the lower stratum as the remains of multiple bodies in a disarticulated heap. A deposit overlaying this stratum was interpreted as the collapsed roof of the tomb. An additional smaller group of human bones was stored in box FA 15 with other assemblage material. The box labels indicate that it may have derived from a distinct MM III pithos burial in the uppermost stratum of the tomb. The report below focuses on the findings from the lowest, 'MM IA', stratum and box FA 15 as separate contexts. A limited number of further fragments are also stored in several other FA boxes, along with assemblage material (FA 2, FA 20, FA 25, FA 28, FA 30), but they will play no further part in the current study as they are not from readily identifiable contexts and/or are associated with ceramics from broad date ranges.56 52 Popham 1974, 189-90. 53 The authors are grateful to Dr Richard Preece (University Museum of Zoology, University of Cambridge) and Dr Eva Laurie (Department of Archaeology, University of York) for providing these identifications. 54 Forsdyke 1927, 264, 275, 283. 55 Ehrich's study is mentioned in a letter from Hutchinson to Myres on 15th February 1937 ( Ashmolean Museum archives; see also Chapter 1 n. 3). Rix's study is referred to in a letter from Hutchinson to Young on 11th February 1938 (BSA archives: Knossos Correspondence 1930-39: Correspondence 1938), a 1952 report on Knossos publications by Hutchinson and a letter from John Cook to Hutchinson on 4th June 1952 (both in the BSA archives: see Chapter 1 n. 3). The MK material is in each case listed under item 4). It is not clear, however, whether reports from either analyst were ever produced or received by Hutchinson. 56 Box FA 2 contains one cranial and two postcranial fragments; box FA 20 has two burnt cranial fragments; box FA 25 has two postcranial fragments; box FA 28 has seven cranial and three possible postcranial fragments; box FA 30 has 13 fragments, including at least three cranial and at least three postcranial fragments (some of the cranial material having traces of burning). Not all of this material was available for study at the time the analysis was undertaken; the author is grateful to Todd Whitelaw for his assistance in establishing counts for the unstudied material.</page><page sequence="77">THE TOMB: THE NON-CERAMIC MATERIAL 69 All of the human bones examined were dis articulated, commingled and highly fragmentary. The remains were assessed in order to address the following questions: 1 ) Are the human remains recovered from the lowest stratum of the tomb derived from primary interments or introduced to the tomb as secondary burials? 2) What is the minimum number of individuals buried in the lowest stratum? 3) What is the age and sex distribution of these individuals? 4) Are the human bones from box FA 15 the remains of a single individual? 5) Are there any pathological lesions present that could provide an indication of health and living environment? The methods used in this analysis and the results are presented below. A catalogue of the bones recorded has been included in Appendix C. Methods Sexing The bones of the pelvis provide the most reliable criteria for determining sex, but no pelvic bones were present in this sample. Sex estimations were based upon a variety of diagnostic criteria of the skull.57 Estimating sex using the skull is less reliable than the pelvis because a degree of overlap exists in the morphological features between the sexes. Different skeletal populations also vary in terms of the extent and range of sexual dimorphism exhibited within the group. These factors are exacerbated in this study by the highly fragmented and commingled nature of the assemblage. The majority of sex estimations were based upon the morphological characteristics of the temporal bone, in particular the mastoid process. All temporal bones were seriated according to robusticity in an attempt to gauge the extent and range of sexual dimorphism within the group. Because of the limitations mentioned above, the sex determinations made in this report have been stated as 'probable' male or female. Only 'adult' skeletal remains were assigned a sex because of the considerable degree of overlap in sexual dimorphism that exists prior to skeletal maturity. Ageing The absence of the necessary skeletal elements meant that age estimation of adult skeletons was not possible for this sample beyond the division of adult/child. While a number of molars were present it was not possible to use molar wear to estimate age because the dentitions were incomplete. Age estima tion of non-adult bones was based on skeletal fusion and growth.58 Table 4.3: Number of human bone fragments of each type excavated from the 'MM IA' stratum and the pithos burial in box FA 15.

These factors placed considerable interpretive limitations on the assemblage. The assemblage from the lowest, 'MMIA' stratum was dominated by bones of the skull (table 4.3). This is a frequent observation in skeletal assemblages excavated from communal tombs. It is probable that selective retention of these bones by the original excava tor is partly responsible for this bias. The tomb was originally excavated in the 1930s and at this time skulls were often the only part of skeletons retained from funerary contexts because of their perceived importance for addressing issues pertinent to the time (i.e. 'race'). Some fragmentation of the human remains may have occurred since the time of excavation,59 but most of the cranial bones were weathered, exhibiting erosion of the ectocranial and endocranial (external and internal) surfaces and smoothing of the fragment edges, indicating that some of the crania had been broken within the burial environment for some time. Indeed, Hutchinson notes in his published report that only one complete skull was found in this stratum (see Chapter 2). Postcranial bones were also present, although they were much less well represented. Postcranial bones identified include the major long bones of the arms and legs as well as the peripheral bones of the hands and feet. The latter is pertinent to the question of whether these were primary or secondary burials. Within secondary burial contexts the phalanges and metapodials are less frequently recovered.60 This evidence may well indicate that the bones had originally been primary interments. The fact that they were disarticulated when excavated by Hutchinson indicates some post-mortem modification of the burials, either a part of a funerary ritual, displacement at the addition of new burials, or perhaps later periods of disturbance of the tombs such as robbing. In contrast to the material from the 'MM I A' stratum, the material from box FA 15 was not dominated by cranial bones and included a range of very fragmentary post-cranial elements. The distribution of skeletal elements does not preclude the assemblage from this context representing a primary interment of a single individual. Minimum Number of Individuals The minimum number of individuals tends to be a very crude measure, calculated from the repetition of skeletal elements. In this study it was possible to further refine this calculation by a comparison of skeletal elements in order to discern whether they could be derived from the same or different individuals. A minimum number of 11 adult individuals are represent Table 4.4: Dental remains from the 'MM IA' stratum of the Tomb.

The skeletal remains from box FA 15 represent a minimum number of one individual. It was not possible to derive a sex or age from the few bones present. The Dentition and Dental Pathology This section discusses the dental remains present and dental pathology or abnormalities observed, table 4.4 shows those dentitions and loose teeth preserved in the 'MM IA' sample. No dental remains were preserved in box FA 15. Caries. A total of five teeth only were recovered, none of which showed evidence of carious lesions. However, there is indirect evidence for caries in the form of an abscess in one of the mandibles. It is likely that the affected tooth had been carious and this is what precipitated the infection of the alveolar bone. Abscesses. One individual suffered ante-mortem loss of the left lower second premolar and first molar (FIG. 4.8). Bone destruction and formation in the form of new lamellar bone is evident. The appearance of the alveolar 59 The archived 1952 report on Knossos publications by Hutchinson (see Chapter 1 n. 3) notes that 'Michael Rix sorted out my skulls but never sent me his conclusions and the skulls are now so damaged that you could not measure them'. 60 Andrews and Bello 2006. 61 Scheuer and Black 2000, 285.</page><page sequence="79">THE TOMB: THE NON-CERAMIC MATERIAL 71 Fig. 4.8.

An abscess forms as a result of the exposure and infection of the pulp cavity of the tooth by microorganisms. The infection tracks down the tooth and pus will accumulate at the root apex, eventually resulting in a sinus.62 Any factors that result in the exposure of the pulp cavity will predispose the teeth to infection and abscesses are frequently associated with chronic caries and severe attrition. Ante-mortem tooth loss. A total of four teeth had been lost during life (5%). Ante-mortem tooth loss may occur for a number of reasons, including dental disease, violence and severe attrition. Ante-mortem loss of the posterior teeth is more common in archaeological populations and usually results from dental disease. This appears to be the case in this sample. Enamel Hypoplasia. None of the observable teeth exhibited hypoplastic defects. However, the small sample size means that this evidence is inconclusive in terms of comparisons with contemporaneous sites. Pathological Lesions Diseases that affect the bones tend to be long-term, chronic conditions and the bones are often only involved in the later stages of the disease. Bone has a limited response to a wide variety of pathological conditions, therefore diagnosis of a specific disease can be problematic. This limitation is exacerbated in this sample because of the highly fragmented nature of the remains. Porotic Hyperostosis. Porotic hyperostosis refers, respectively, to the porous appearance of the ectocranial surface of the cranial vault and the expanded condition of the inner diploic space (the middle portion of bone when viewed in cross section). The condition is usually associated with either acquired or genetic anaemia and reflects the body's attempts to increase red blood cell production by expanding the red bone marrow (marrow hyperplasia) in the diploic space. This leads to a thinning of the outer table of the skull and a porous appearance to the ectocranial surface.63 This condition is frequently associated in the bioarchaeological literature with iron deficiency anaemia, as a consequence of a poor diet, pathogen exposure or parasitic infection.64 Six cranial fragments from the 'MM IA' stratum exhibited porotic hyperostosis in the form of porosity on the outer surface of the bone and an enlargement of the diploic space (FIG. 4.9). The lesions present were healed rather than active at the time of death, indicating that the condition was the result of an acquired anaemia rather than an inherited haemolytic anaemia such as thalassaemia. The prevalence of porotic hyperostosis observed in other Greek samples dating from the EBA to Late Minoan periods ranges from approximately 11-52%.65 A similar frequency of these lesions was observed in the burials at the nearby LM Kephala Tholos tomb.66 An additional small fragment of bone from box FA 15 exhibited very severe marrow hyperplasia and was unusually light, indicating a loss in bone mass (figs. 4.10 and 4.11). The severity of the bone changes, together with the small size of the fragment, meant that it was difficult to identify, but the author believes that it is likely to be a fragment of frontal bone (inferior to the glabella). The severity of the hyperplasia and the loss in bone mass, together with the location of the lesion, correspond with thalassaemia intermedia as observed by Lagia et al. in a clinical case.67 Putative cases of thalassaemia have been observed at the Minoan cemeteries of Khania Odos Palama and Armenoi,68 and this form of hereditary anaemia commonly affects central and eastern Mediterranean populations, particu larly those areas correlated with endemic malaria.69 One cannot make a firm diagnosis of thalassaemia on the basis of one small bone fragment. However, the skeletal changes are highly suggestive. A further fragment from this context was thought by the author to be a fragment of the proximal ulna. This fragment showed some evidence of new bone growth, though was badly weathered and damaged, making interpreta tion difficult. Unfortunately the rest of the bone fragments (should these belong to a single individual) are in a very poor condition. The incomplete nature of the bones means that the diagnosis of a specific disease is difficult. Benign Neoplasm. One fragment of cranium from the 'MM IA' stratum also exhibited a small button osteoma (FIG. 4.12). This is a benign neoplastic condition and it is unlikely that the individual was aware of its presence during life. Non-metric traits Non-metric traits are natural skeletal variants rather than pathological features. Those found on the skull and teeth do have an element of heritability to them, although they should not be used to verify genetic links between individuals within the same tomb or cemetery. One skull fragment from the 'MM I A' stratum exhibited a wormian bone on the lambdoid suture. This is essentially a separate ossicle of bone within the suture at the back of the skull. Conclusion Interpretation of this skeletal assemblage was severely hampered by the extremely fragmented and incomplete 62 Hillson 1986; Roberts and Manchester 1995. 63 Lewis 2000. 64 Stuart-Macadam 1991; Ortner 2002. 65 Keenleyside and Panayotova 2006, 381. 66 Gowland in Preston 2005. 67 Lagia et al. 2007. 68 Hallager and McGeorge 1992. 69 Keenleyside and Panayotova 2006.</page><page sequence="81">THE TOMB: THE NON-CERAMIC MATERIAL 73 condition of the bones. Despite these problems some additional information has been obtained from this analysis. Given the range of skeletal elements present in the 'MM IA' stratum, including the small bones of the hands and feet, it seems likely that the burials had originally been primary interments. These were later disturbed and the bones disarticulated and 'heaped'. Whether this was a result of an associated funerary ritual or later disturbance is not known. Presumably, the bodies were deposited over a period of time, and the decaying remains of antecedents were likely to have been disturbed by successive burials. A minimum number of 12 individuals were identified from the lower ('MM IA') stratum of the tomb, and these included males, females and a non adult. This is in accordance with findings from the nearby, though much later, Kephala Tholos which showed a similar range in terms of the sex and age groups interred. Females outnumber males by a ratio of 2:1 in this sample. Male skeletons tend to preserve better than female ones due to their larger and more robust bones. It is possible that any material transferred to Heraklion Museum included material from this stratum which was comprised mainly of males, thus distorting the sex ratio of the remaining assemblage. Alternatively, it could be a reflection of the original demographic of the tomb and if so, it is interesting to note observations of a preponderance of females in several other Prepalatial burial contexts on Crete.70 The skeletal remains in box FA 15 may well represent a single individual. However, this is difficult to confirm unreservedly due to the fragmentary and damaged nature of the bones. A range of pathological indicators were observed including abscesses, porotic hyperostosis, benign neoplastic disease and, from box FA 15, a possible case of thalassaemia. The small sample however reduces their interpretive value in terms of the lives and diet of these people. R.

Three separate MMIIIb strata were visible, and all the material had obviously been thrown downhill in a north-west direction from the bluff immediately to the south east; the latter however has no depth of earth and would not repay the trouble of excavation. The dump itself however proves that there must once have been a considerable building of MMIIIb date somewhere on the summit of the hill. The finds included a number of complete small vases and a few lamps, large quantities of sherds, two sword pommels in marble, one or two fragments of painted wall plaster and a very interesting base (of a fruitstand? or lamp?) adorned with painted white spirals and with lumps of barbotine pock-work. The two published reports on the site, in the Archaeo logical Reports and Archâologischer Anzeiger for 1935, present abbreviated versions of this same information.2 Hutchinson referred to the site as a 'dump', considering it to be a secondary deposit of domestic material from a higher location to the south east. Hood, however, has queried this interpretation and proposed instead that the Deposit is mortuary in character (see Chapter 1). There are no known excavation records, but the SM holds 13 boxes of material from the site, comprising ceramics, a number of fragments of stone artefacts, faunal material, plaster and bronze fragments, metallurgical debris and marine shells. Four of the boxes are labelled with the excavation code 1935/2 (FA 1-FA 3 and 13 A) and the other nine are labelled 1935/4 (see Appendix B). The use of the code 1935/2 is presumably simply a mistake in the labelling of some of the boxes, as this code was consistently used in contemporary reports and correspondence to refer to a test excavation in the area of Teke which had no Minoan material, and from which these boxes' material clearly does not, therefore, derive (see also Chapter 1). The 1941 inventory of boxes from excavations by Hutchinson (see Chapter 2) lists five boxes for 1935/2 and nine for 1935/4. Most of these boxes are assigned to the 'Dump' (i.e. the Deposit) but their descriptions are otherwise very brief and do not include box numbers, with the result that very few of the entries can be matched with present-day SM boxes, and little supplementary information can be derived from this list as a whole. It is likely that some of the material from the Deposit has been transferred to Herakleion Museum. It was noted in Chapter 2 above that some of the artefacts in the early photographs (FIGS. 2.2—4) which are no longer in the SM may derive from the Deposit, since one of the identifiable sherds in fig. 2.4 is labelled '1935/2' (/: C383) and a further, uncatalogued, sherd (/) is stored in Deposit box FA 3. The two sword pommels noted in Hutchinson's unpublished report are not in the Deposit boxes and have presumably been transferred to Herakleion Museum. Hutchinson's report describes three distinct MM IIIB strata in the Deposit, as well as a thin LM IA deposit on the northern edge. Several of the SM box labels refer to these levels: FA 9 is associated with the upper stratum, FA 3 with the 2nd stratum, and FA 10 and FA 11 with the 3rd stratum. No depths are given on any of the box labels, however; nor is there mention on any of the labels of the LM IA deposit. Two labels refer to a 'stony layer' (FA 4) and 'stony deposit' (FA 7), and the latter at least appears to have a link with the upper stratum, as discussed in Section III.2 below. L. P. THE CERAMIC MATERIAL A total of670 ceramic sherds are held in the 1935/2 and 1935/4 boxes in the SM. Most are Bronze Age, though there are 23 from the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods. There is evidence of post-excavation gluing on only one vessel (C366; the sherd to which it was origi nally joined is absent, however), and none of the sherds has been labelled with its context by the excavators.

Karo 1935, 240; Payne 1935, 168.</page><page sequence="83">16 KNOSSOS MONAST1R1AKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT ' The basis on which ceramic material found during the Deposit excavation was kept or discarded is not known. As with the curated Tomb material (which was excavated in the same season as the Deposit), fine, medium and coarse wares are present in the Deposit boxes but there is a heavy predominance of sherds which are either diagnostic in shape or decorated — indeed, almost all of the material falls under one or both of these categories. This dataset therefore probably only reflects a fraction of the material uncovered during the excavation. If we assume that broken vessels which remained in situ, and were therefore recognisable as being reconstructable, would have been more likely to be collected (as was argued above for the Tomb material, and is surely also the case for C446 and C477 below), then the low number of joining sherds among the Deposit material suggests that most of the fragments had already been dispersed and were in secondary contexts at the time they were excavated (only 11 of the 121 catalogued ceramics are represented by more than one sherd). This would accord with Hutchinson's interpretation of the site as a secondary deposit of material. There are a number of vessels in the Deposit boxes which are complete or almost complete, on which Hutchinson also commented in his unpublished report, but they are in the minority and tend to be small, robust shapes which would be most likely to survive re-deposition intact (i.e. conical cups, saucers and flat-rimmed juglets). The criteria employed for including objects in the catalogue for the present analysis are identical to those used for the Tomb material (see Chapter 3): that their shape is recognisable and that they are datable within one or two ceramic phases. Two vessels currently stored in SM Tomb boxes have been included in the Deposit catalogue below: the straight-sided cup C383, stored in Tomb box FA 20 but labelled '1935/2' in the early photograph reproduced in FIG. 2.4 /; and the pedestalled bowl C384, stored in Tomb box FA 22 but ascribed by Hutchinson to the Deposit in his unpublished report. The resulting catalogue comprises 121 objects, from all of the Deposit boxes except FA 6 and FA 13 A. These objects account for 25% of all the Bronze Age sherds in the Deposit boxes. This is a lower percentage than for the Tomb material (see Chapter 3), partly because of the paucity of joins in the Deposit boxes: most vessels are only represented by a very small proportion of the original whole and are therefore often difficult to date with precision. However, the uncatalogued Bronze Age material appears to fall within the same general date range as the catalogued artefacts, and shapes which are not represented in the catalogue will be discussed below.

There are also two larnax fragments: the gable end of a lid and a foot (box FA 9; FIG. 5.9 a-b). Both derive from chest larnakes (by contrast with the tub larnakes found in the Tomb: see Chapter 3), and they may represent a single larnax, since they share the same fabric (coarse; grey at the core and orange-brown at the surface). Discussion The catalogued Bronze Age pottery ranges from EM III/MM IA to LM IIIB or C in date (table 5.2). Most ceramic phases are represented, but the majority of the vessels date to MM III and LM IA. As noted in the Introduction (Chapter 1, fig. 1.4), there is only a small proportion of catalogued material which predates MM IIB, in contrast to the significant late Prepalatial and MM IB assemblage in the Tomb boxes. Since Hood observed MM IA and MM II surface sherds in the area of the Deposit in 1953,6 this pre-MM IIB material in the Deposit boxes cannot necessarily be dismissed as a product of post-excavation mixing with the Tomb assemblage. Most of the late Prepalatial material could potentially belong to either EM III or MM IA; it is notable that there is no Polychrome Ware, whose presence is one of the principal indicators of MM IA, but this ware also comprised a minority of the Tomb's much larger late Prepalatial corpus.

There is a strong similarity in vessel shapes between the Tomb and Deposit sites in the different phases represented. A mortuary function for the Deposit material cannot, therefore, be ruled out. There are fragments of six pithoi, which may have served as receptacles for burials. The two catalogued examples, C449 and C477, date to MM III and LM IA respectively; the four uncatalogued pithoi comprise three conical forms (in boxes FA 8, FA 9, FA 11) and one ovoid (in box FA 8) (fig. 5.9 c and d). No tub larnax fragments are recognisable among the Deposit material, but this would not preclude a mortuary interpretation for the Deposit, given their low numbers at the nearby Tomb too by comparison with pithoi. The presence of at least one chest larnax within the assemblage is intriguing. This is a late receptacle type in Crete, appearing in LM III. Unlike the earlier tub larnakes, which sometimes occurred in settlement contexts as well as tombs, chests appear to have had a more exclusively mortuary function. This strongly suggests that in LM III at least, the Deposit, or a nearby location from which its material had derived, was a funerary site; and the open shapes of this period (particularly C483, which is from the same box as the chest larnax fragments) may have belonged to burial assemblages. As at the Tomb, post-Bronze Age material is represented in the Deposit, here ranging from Classical to Roman (table 5.3). The catalogued vessels from the boxes associated with the two lower strata in the Deposit have a limited date-range (MM IIB to LMIA), while the upper stratum material ranges from late Prepalatial to LM III, with post-Bronze Age artefacts as well. There may be a particular link between box FA 9 of the upper stratum and FA 7 of the 'stony deposit', as they contain almost all of the vessels with sherd joins across boxes (C402, C404 and C414).7 Unless this is due to post-excavation mixing, it suggests that these boxes represent either the same or two contiguous contexts. L. P. THE STONE MATERIAL For the stone items from MK as a whole, the distribution is skewed towards the material found in The pedestalled bowl C401 also has component sherds in more than one Deposit box (FA 8 and FA 12), but there is also a further sherd in Tomb box FA 19, which suggests that this vessel has been subject to post-excavation mixing.</page><page sequence="92">THE MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI DEPOSIT 85 Table 5.3: Post-Bronze Age ceramic artefacts in the Deposit boxes (all information courtesy of Peter Callaghan).

These finds were noted in Hutchinson's unpublished report on the Deposit and the preliminary published reports by Payne and Karo.8 However, no further information is given on context, style or date; both objects are presumably in the Herakleion Museum. Discussion Stone Vessels Some 41 vessels are represented; all fragmentary. Dumped rubbish from the main settlement is always a possibility at the edges of the same. A very few by their large amount preserved hint at completeness: e.g. S3, S7, S21. But, in fact, it is really impossible to determine to what extent any of these might have been whole when deposited: even assuming that this is the correct interpretation of how they arrived there. By definition, though, dumped material is almost always disposed of because it is faulty. Yet there is nothing to distinguish this set in terms of proportions preserved from that known to come from the Tomb. This is disconcerting. From the Deposit were gathered many bowls (17): three Bird's Nests, three (possibly four) shouldered forms, one lugged, another with a ledge-rim, five large ones, one decorated with grooves (or a pyxis), one with a ring-foot, and one anonymous base. Together with these were bucket-jars (three certain S21-S23, five less so S22-S27, S29-S30), a basin of unusual rim form (S35), three lamps with handles (S36-S38), with one further certain and another possible handle (S41-S42), a cup (S43), a tumbler (S44), a lid (S45), perhaps a teapot-spout (S46), the same rhyton (S47) and sundry uncertain pieces (S31-S34, S48). A broad similarity exists between the two sets from the Deposit and the Tomb: bowls, bucket-jars and lamps being obviously held in common. If a single source for all was ever to be demonstrated, this would surely have to be the Tomb. However the considerable distance between the two locations on Monastiriako Kephali, and the fact that the Deposit is at a higher level, together make it most probable that the two sources under discus sion have no connection. Thus, the similarity observed would most likely indicate the presence of further and comparable tombs on the north side of the ridge. Of the near score of bowls (17), most are quite canonical, a few warrant particular comment. The Bird's Nest Bowls (MSV 3;9 SI, S2, S3; FIG. 5.10) represent the commoner species, lacking any separately moulded rim. The three BNB here are considerably larger than that inside the Tomb (S4), have no raised rim and are all of serpentinite: canonical Neopalatial in fact, as their position in the anonymous mix of the Deposit could argue. Bowls with a curved or carinatedprofile come with or without lugs (MSV 6 and 7 respectively;10 S5, S6, 8 Payne 1935, 168; Kara 1935, 240. 9 Warren 1969, 7-11. 10 Warren 1969, 17-19 and 20-1.</page><page sequence="102">THE MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI DEPOSIT 95 S7; FIG. 5.10). Most here, being fragmentary, cannot with safety be assigned to one or the other sort — though perhaps an apparent lack of handles in the cases of the reasonably well preserved S5 and S7 might suggest they at least belong to MSV 6. Depending on how high or low on the vase's profile the angle is positioned, sub-types A and C of Warren's MSV 6 may be invoked. Such are widely distributed all over the island, with a strong MM I bias and a tendency to use serpentinite; funerary contexts dominate at the present — if only because they are best represented in the excavated record. The specimens at Monastiriako are thus in no ways exceptional. S8 (fig. 5.10), of chlorite, if inverted from its position as drawn (quite possible) could display connections to a small set of such which carry incised 'grooves' on their upper halves.11 These grooves are normally vertically arranged: the assign ment here must remain somewhat hesitant. One (S9; FIG. 5.10) does have a shoulder lug. A large vessel, it is as broad as it is high, with its shoulder placed high on the profile: features that would all place it in Warren's sub-type C of MSV 7.12 Not a common variety, it may yet be found anywhere on Crete, in domestic contexts and almost exclusively of serpenti nite: it tends to be MM II-LM I in date. The ledge-rimmed bowl (MSV 8; S10; FIG. 5.10) was particularly popular, and so developed a plethora of sub-forms in EM IIÏ-MM II, as well as a notable LM set.13 The smaller examples, i.e. the majority, may be said to have funerary ties; they are to be found all over the island, and in all sorts of stones. S10 has a slight curve to its profile — suited to Warren's sub type A: it is a typical piece of this earlier set. Lack of determining features mean that another five bowls (S13-S17; FIGS. 5.11 and 5.12) can only be broadly defined as just and only that. For S13 alone is the full profile recognisable: it has heavy but shallow proportions — it could be placed in MSV 10, 31 or even 37.14 Those here found tend to be of two general sizes: with a rim diameter in the low 20s cm (S13 S14) or the low 30s (S15-S17). The side-profiles are set at 40-50 degrees to the horizontal, or rather more steeply in the case of S16; some exhibit more, others less of a curve in their line; some are thicker. Where no base is preserved, then there is always the chance that the foot was moulded (and so an MSV 32); likewise the lack of a rim permits the possibility that it was everted (and so an MSV 8). Smaller examples, and of more exotic stones, will always have a greater chance to be MM I—II than later. S17 is both broad and heavy in stature: the walls have attained a relatively acute slant over their last few cm. This and the irregularly shaped lug-handles argue it should be either an MSV 10 (cf. D. 111) or an MSV 37.15 The size and the material (serpentinite) probably make it domestic rather than primarily designed as funerary in intent. It could belong anywhere within the MM I-LM I date range. Remaining within the generic 'bowl' definition are a handful of oddities — regrettably, being again but very small fragments, their proper appreciation is compromised. S18 (FIG. 5.12), a basal piece, combines a moulded foot with a wide-spreading and low profile: not an impossible format for the simpler MSV 8 and 10 forms, for example. The neatly-enough worked diagonal grooves, however, are most unusual. At present they seem best, though not exactly, paralleled by a sub-type D of Warren's pyxis (MSV 33).16 These are two-part vases (D. 252 and 254), usually of chlorite, and almost always to be found in the Mesara tholoi in EM III-MMI contexts (Koumasa B provides a serpentinite example though). S19 (FIG. 5.12), another basal fragment, looks from its profile to be just another bowl with a moulded base (i.e. MSV 8,10 etc). The surprise lies in the underside of the base: this has been hollowed out to form an authentic ring-foot (in ceramic parlance). Such a feature can be tracked down as a rarity in other forms: illustrated in MSV are individual teapots (D. 303 — MSV 41, from Mochlos, EM II), a small pot (D. 272 — MSV 36, Mochlos) and a miscellaneous vase (D. 306 — MSV 42, Mochlos, EM-MM).17 It is probably a coincidence that these are all from Mochlos, but the possibility may thus be entertained that S19 was an EM-MM import from there to Rnossos: the author is not inclined to believe this as S19 is a larger item than the Mochliot ones and of serpentinite (against the tufa and marble used at Mochlos). Finally is S20 (FIG. 5.12), yet another basal piece, whose distinguishing feature is a rather slight concavity to the profile of the lower body. Such a line is rarely seen in bowls (though not impossible); they are commoner in MSV 20, a tumbler type, but never in so wide a form as this one is.18 On balance, then, some bowl or jug/jar would seem the most likely: certainly an open rather than a truly closed shape. A date is hard to assign here.

A certain discrepancy in size (as indicated by diameters) is noticeable, signifying two sub-sets. S22 and S27 are larger — with rims around 24-30+ cm, and their bases probably some 5-8 cm smaller. S21, S23, S25 and S26 comprise the slighter version: with rims at 14-16 across, and bases around 13-14 cm. They both show instances where the side profile tapers quite markedly towards the base: S22 in this set. The smaller calibre form also comes in taller and squatter forms: the latter have a height less than the base diameter; for the former the ratio is equal or greater in height. Whether the same held true for the overall larger set cannot be observed from those in this particular group. As observed above, the bucket-jar is associated with settlements, occurs all over the island and at any time within the first two Palatial periods, with a floruit in the second. The preference for serpentinite is obvious, only S29 is of marble. Remaining now of the large and open forms where a goodly amount of the profile exists is S35 (fig. 5.15). Features of note comprise its moulded base, the undercut and so ledge-like rim, and at least one button handle just below the rim. The curving profile would certainly suggest a bowl or basin (MSV 7 or 32 perhaps)20 — influenced to a degree conceivably by Egyptian vase forms?21 The closest illustrated comparable piece in MSV is P. 581,22 if one assumes the Monastiriako vase is not enough preserved to show spout or side-lug handles. All these vessels, and so S35 itself, are best placed in the Neopalatial phase of production. It is likely to be a rare if not unique piece. Of the lamps (MSV 24;23 fig. 5.16), S37 and S38 represent plain examples of the usual sort: the number of wick-cuttings (two being the norm) and the height or otherwise of the stem/pedestal cannot be determined, due to their fragmentary state. Two pendant handles are assumed. All told, these are most likely to be broadly Neopalatial in manufacture. S36 is different: with its straight stick-handle combined with its moulded base distinguished from the upper basin by the presence of a low stem/pedestal.24 It can date anywhere within MM I-LM I: perhaps towards the later given the similarity in its basic body form to the canonical types described here first. S42 (FIG. 5.17) could be a stray handle. S41 is harder to comprehend: it certainly sports a horizontal handle, but the angle of the side's profile may be too acute, its interior basin seems rather deep; and overall it is of a very wide dimension. On the other hand, other candidates of the requisite size and even vaguely similar handles are exceedingly hard to spot: about the only ones suitable would be something within MS V 10, bowls with handles. Such tend to be early (MM I—II) and with Mesara connections: either trait could apply at Monastiriako. The matter must be left open. S43 is a cup (MSV 17;25 FIG. 5.17). Its strap handle might at first sight be thought to place it within Warren's sub-type E, but its profile and size are better suited to his sub-type C. This latter type is a 'copy' of the metal-influenced ceramic cups (or a parallel imitation), equivalent to the Kamares Ware pieces (MM I—II). It would in all likelihood have had a moulded foot. Such are often associated with the elite centres of the north and centre. S44 is a 'tumbler' (ajar in Warren's terminology — MSV 21; FIG. 5.17): low and small it corresponds to his sub-type A.26 Such may be worked up from any number of stone-types (this is of serpentine here), and are heavily associated with the funerary contexts of the Mesara in MM I (and occasionally MM II at Knossos). S45 is again a typical lid (MSV 27;27 FIG. 5.17), here flanged on the underside, and probably once with a central knob- or pawn-handle. They turn up throughout the whole period the craft was practised. Of reasonable size, at some 18 cm across, and made from serpentinite, this too belongs to MM III-LM I. S46 (fig. 5.17) is a lone spout, of serpentinite, now sheared off. Its profile, size and cross-section probably rule it out as having a spouted-bowl as its parent vessel. If so, but two shapes remain as likely:28 jugs (MSV 22) and teapots (MSV 41). Mayhap it is slightly closer to the latter—especially Warren sub-types B or D: neither are common, and are located through the north and centre of Crete, in EM III-MM I contexts. As a jug, it ought to be sub-type A or B: the first is mostly MM I, funerary and from the north and centre; the latter runs between MM I-LM I, domestic in context and similarly located on the island. Unlike all the pieces to now considered,29 the last (S47; FIG. 5.17) is clearly far from finished, as well as being but a fragment. These two factors leave room for doubt as to the identification proposed here — that they are part of a conical rhyton (MSV 34, sub-type A).30 The slight taper evidenced declares its conical form and its relatively modest proportions; it constitutes the very top of the vase, as the presence of a ?sawn flat and polished plane at the larger end declares. This sort of rhyton is a Neopalatial product; they tend to be associated with elite centres (domestic and ritual) in the north, centre and far east of the island. 19 Warren 1969, 34-5. 20 Warren 1969, 20-1 and 78-80 respectively. 21 Cf.

Only one item, the postulated conical rhyton (S47) is clearly a waste-piece — broken and discarded in the course of manufacture. Typically the exterior has been roughly worked up to form — the taper, flat top and generally circular shape are already expressed: planes and facets have been removed by saw and abrasion work; the interior has been drilled out. The fatal damage was perhaps incurred in the drilling action, perhaps when attention returned to the exterior profile. Interestingly, the spout of the bucket-jar S22 has not been opened by drilling through its hole: was this final act simply deemed unnecessary since the vase was destined for a tomb? One of the first actions by the craftsman was to produce a roughly shaped block from which the vase eventually emerges. The external surfaces do not then require more than a decent level of flatness: some traces of this stage are probably to be identified in the condition some bases (S13, S20, S35) are now in — flat enough to stand firm, but with a partly pocked, partly smoothed face. This would be easiest achieved by a punch or perhaps a chisel on the softer stones — percussion work. Of the three vases so treated, two are larger, and one smaller. Size of vessel is not then an apparent factor in making or leaving the exterior so; nor anything to do with grip. The block created, thenceforth the craftsman will have worked by removing unwanted material according to guidelines marked into the surface. One area where these tend to remain is on the rim, where circles are scratched on by a simple compass to mark the position of the mouth and the side profiles. Three examples are evidenced here: S16, S35 and S22. The first pair have but a single line, the last three. The removal of the interior is most often accomplished by a drill. Rotary abrasion marks, with an often high level of polish accompanying them, are a particularly clear set of evidence for this. Some (e.g. S2, S6) are associated with a quite open profile, others a little (S4) or much more (S35) undercut. Different drilling materials and techniques will have accompli shed these dissimilar effects. Occasionally (e.g. S21, S44 and S71) the internal base profile was also marked by such grooves: the significance of their form and appearance has yet to be fully tested. A very unusual instance of the use of the drill is on the exterior of S19: here it is partly responsible for the hollowing out of its ring-foot. This could be more of a refining action as indications exist that some sort of chipping action was employed first. More usually though the interior's finish will vary between smooth (e.g. S15) to varying qualities of polish (S43), with the latter not infrequently accompanied by fine abrasive scratching (generally obliquely aligned to the vertical — e.g. S12, or more nearly vertical — e.g. S17). Rougher (S5) and matt (S44) surfaces exist; one (S13) hints that a degree of chipping had occurred. Exteriors are likewise treated: a corresponding set of surface conditions result. Matt or abraded (S5), even rougher (S24) textures are seen too. Refinements to profiles, in the form of grooves and channels, are apparently achieved by combining saw and abrasion work. Thus the ledge-rim of S10 is 'underscored' by a saw cut, and the grooves on S18 by saw and abrasion. In the case of the softer chlorite, S8, the irregular line taken by the channel has come about because a series of independent cuts were made: one extending, albeit not that accurately, the previous. For bowl S68, the purpose of the drilled hole has been preferred as an aid to attaching a handle: not a common occurrence for a simple bowl. The alternative explanation, of an aid to mending a broken vessel, is almost as unusual. What can be said concerning the allocation of these vases in time and space within the Tomb and Deposit? And how do the vase-types connect with a wider pattern of distribution in Crete? It has to be stated at the start that the lack of clear stratigraphy does bedevil this enquiry. If one goes on the typologies and observations as established by Warren, the following account can be extracted. This is applicable to both sets of material. Some ten items (S4^S7, S10, S18, S19, S43, S44, S46), and perhaps some others too (e.g. S41) are most at home amongst the first floruit of the craft: EM III-MM I. Only S4 is said to have been recovered in the Tomb, but nowhere near its bottom; most of the rest are from undatable contexts in the Deposit. At least three of the vase types (S4, bowl/?pyxis S18, tumbler S44) have good connections to groups with strong Mesara traits — and so funerary use. Equally, four other sets do not: bowls S5-S7, with the ledge rim version S10 are geographically more widely spread, and the cup S43 and spout S46 are all more associated with the centre and north, still at times with some links to the grave. A further nine vases (S1-S3, lugged bowl S9, basin S35, lamps with pendant handles S37, S38, the lid S45 and the rhyton S47) are more kindred to sorts found in the second floruit, in the Neopalatial era. Apart from the rhyton, with a piece in both the Tomb and Deposit boxes, all are from the Deposit. They may turn up at any of the major settlements or elite structures on the island: no particular ties to the Tomb are noted. This distribution leaves two main sets unassigned (12 pieces): the bucket-jars (at eight specimens a very prevalent shape) and the lamps with horizontal handles (perhaps four). Both may belong broadly to MM I to LM I. Both are at home with the living and the dead 31 Evely 1993, 177-81 and 182-6.</page><page sequence="105">98 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND DEPOSIT' alike across the island. Happily they turn up here in both the Tomb and the Deposit: those in the former do at least include some closer to the MM I—II zone, but nothing significant may be deduced. The recent publication of the vases from another palatial site, Phaistos,32 does not — of itself — resolve the underlying problem of this material group: that of a more precise dating for manufacture. It does, however, add full descriptions of just short of a thousand pieces. All the main types seen at Knossos are paralleled there. Some seem less common at Phaistos: the ledge-rimmed bowl and bucket-jar, for example. Others remain at a rarity level: the raised rim variant of the Bird's Nest Bowl. Yet others may be peculiar to that other palatial site: the pedestalled cup.33 In conclusion, little can be observed on this topic with regard to the Monastiriako corpus. Those vases assumed to be early deposited certainly include examples whose major distribution is more with the communal tombs of the Mesara. This should be no surprise, for the same applies up the valley at the Archanes cemetery:34 and one would expect Knossos, with its 'pull', to be partaking of a similar pattern of contacts and habits. Whether or not the funerary associations so often mentioned with the items from the southern tholoi reflect real practice or the uneven representation in the documented archaeological record of tombs over settlements at this early period is best left open for now. By the Neopalatial period, distri bution and usage seem to have evened out: almost anything can occur anywhere. Stone Tools and Objects Numbering 15 in all, the majority of these are the so called ground-tools (nine) with two chipped/flaked pieces and four mixed items. Of them all, only one (S63) — part of a bivalve mould for working metal — is of more than passing interest. Of the nine ground-tools,35 pounding and grinding actions account for the use-wear on six of them (S50 S55): a fairly normal preponderance for this class. S50 (fig. 5.18) is a good specimen of its type — where the whole surface has been altered by a combination of work that included pounding, grinding and crushing; the shape has been so modified to a regular enough sphere. The results of pounding actions are also seen on three others (S51-S53), but in differing proportions and blends, and so forming slightly varying tool-types. S51 (fig. 5.18) has a restricted zone of grinding alongside considerable pounding damage; S52 reverses this pattern of wear — and probably bears traces of polishing rather than rougher grinding. S53 is certainly a pounder, with some possible grinding/crushing work — its shape suggests it may have been employed in a manner reminiscent of a pestle. S54 and S55 are grinders — of differing shapes according to their natural form when collected. S57 (fig. 5.18) declares its worked condition by the sharp angle so created at an end by the processes of grinding and polishing. S56 is an unusual form — and also in its probable use. The matter turns on the flaked condition of the larger end: such can occur in straightforward pounding actions, where the forces of the blows cause flaking. Here, where the flakes have become detached from both faces of a longer side, the resultant appearance bears a passing resemblance to that of a deliberately created 'chopper',36 Elsewhere scratches and even a degree of 'polish'-wear argue that further tasks were demanded of the tool. S58 is an item of uncertain character: it could be a tool. Something of the same observation probably applies to S60, which certainly has been subject to a handling that has left it with small planes and fine abra sion scratching. The uniformity here of the presence of a polish, and the directional nature of the scratching — as well as the unusual colouration and patterning of the stone qua stone — make it feasible that the conditions remarked upon are all due to its having been deliberately worked to the shape it now holds. This still, regrettably, leaves its purpose undetermined, but makes it less likely to be a tool. Much the same can be said of S61, reinforced by the choice of banded-limestone, almost never a stone of choice for tools. The stones used in this tool group are absolutely typical: quartz/quartzites (four), crystalline limestone/ marble (three), and one apiece for serpentinite and ?arkose. Nothing more need be said. The pieces collected as S62 (FIG. 5.18) are all large flat crystals of gypsum (perhaps in its selenite form).37 Such have a natural tendency to split along planes of growth: as a result these several pieces might once have been part of a larger chunk. Even so, the physical condition at one edge of the chunkier remnant looks suspiciously as if it has been abraded: it could be to produce some powder or to alter the chunk's shape. 32 Palio 2008. 33 See S41 above. 34 Sakellarakis and Sakellaraki 1997, 571. 35 On comparable stone tools from Knossos specifically, see Evely 1984, 224-9 for the Unexplored Mansion (LM I—III broadly); and from Palaikastro, Evely 2012, 228-38, 262-3, 265-6 for Block M and in preparation for Building 1, dating from MM I-LM III. No attempt is made here to give extensive parallels to these individuals, typical as they are of their sorts. Additional comparanda are documented in the recent reports from Pseira and Mochlos. 36 Candidates for chopping tools are not at all often recognised in the Bronze Age repertoire on Crete: two such (but one also with pounding action that might be responsible) are known to the author from EM contexts at Petras Kephala. Another, from Palaikastro Building 1, is from an LM II—III A1 context. 37 Selenite is here used to indicate a large crystalline form of gypsum with sectile qualities; it is not translucent and has a pearly sheen.</page><page sequence="106">THE MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI DEPOSIT 99 S63 (FIG. 5.19) is the last to be considered. But a corner fragment of a two-piece mould,38 it is thus frustratingly incomplete. In its choice of stone (a schist), its bivalve nature, the position and style of the pouring channel, provision for the secure binding of the copper strips and the manner of working the interior and design — all may be matched in the Minoan corpus. It does find parallels in funerary contexts, but the chance still remains that it is but discarded rubbish.39 The block of stone was well-enough squared-up by saw and abrasion: traces on the sides show this. The mould's interior was sunk—probably by judicious use of chisel and abrasion: had there been any drill-work in excising the interior, no trace of it now remains. The pouring channel could have been drilled, but again such work has been overlain and obscured by abrasion refinements. In order to assure as tight a marrying of the two halves during the pour, strips of copper were wound tightly around the mould: a corner and a nearby linear zone have been roughened up by saw-cuts and scratches to provide essential grip. Finally into the sunken interior was cut an additional shallow form — a sort of arc remains, whose outline was marked by a double groove and also four minute holes (?drilled). The result of the cast would be a block of metal, on one of whose sides a motif in low relief would have been visible, enlivened (if that is the right term) by a very slight border and small projecting pins. It does not make much sense. Nothing resembling this has been found: the whole proves something of an enigma in its incomplete state. Concerning the obsidian/?chert (two: S65-S66), little is worth saying. They could have nothing to do with any burial matters, as obsidian may turn up as strays anywhere. One (S65) is a small flake, scarred by use and perhaps by having been reworked a touch too (to create the notch). The other (S66) is an anonymous chunk, a discard from early in the course of preparing a core for working. D. E. OTHER MATERIALS 06 Crucible fragment (1, small).

They may be identifiable with the 'one or two fragments of painted wall plaster' noted by Hutchinson in his unpublished report. Three complete marine shells and two further fragments are stored in box FA 8, all gastropods and all unmodified.

The absence of field records, including any plans and sections, from both excavation seasons ( 1933 and 1935) has meant that the contexts and interrelationships of a number of the SM boxes are not clear. The stratigraphy of the site is complex, probably due to a combination of ancient disturbance of earlier levels by later mortuary activities, and post-excavation mixing. The excavators' strategies for the retention or discard of finds at the time of excavation, which is a major factor in gauging how representative the available data are, are also not entirely transparent in the absence of field records, and the retention policies for different types of material probably varied. A further factor to consider is that following the two excavations, some of the retained material was transferred to Herakleion Museum (certainly including ceramic and stone material), but it has not been possible to establish a full list of this corpus and it is only partly represented in the present analysis. Finally, it appears from Hutchinson's reports of the 1935 season that the site has not been excavated in its entirety, although it is unclear what proportion of it, if any, is still preserved for future investigation. This must be borne in mind when examining issues such as burial numbers, for which only an MNI can be provided. Nevertheless, the analysis of the SM material does allow some important insights into burial practices at the largest urban centre on Bronze Age Crete. It not only provides our earliest certain Bronze Age evidence for tomb use at Rnossos, but also contributes substantially to our understanding of longer-term burial practices at this site. For while Knossos' population showed an unusually high level of interest in tomb use during the Protopalatial and Neopalatial periods, few of the known cemetery sites have yet been published in any detail. Use of the Tomb site for burial can be confidently identified from either EM III or MM IA to LM IA. Very limited earlier, intrusive material was also found by the excavators among the mortuary remains, including a Neolithic sherd and the stone 'celts' (S73 and S74 in Chapter 4); a limited amount of later Bronze Age and post-Bronze Age ceramic, stone, metal and faunal material is also present, attesting to subsequent activities in the area, though of a less clear nature (see discussions in Chapters 3 and 4). The overall history of the Tomb as a mortuary locale appears to fall into two broad phases. The first dates principally to the late Prepalatial period but appears to have extended also into MM IB (on the basis of patterns in the ceramic evidence). In this first phase (the '3rd stratum') the Tomb was a subterranean chamber, possibly at least partially artificial, and was used for multiple burials. A minimum of 12 individuals (including one non-adult) were buried in this level (p. 70). This may have been the burial ground for a specific kin group, although its size and composition is not possible to gauge on the present evidence. It is intriguing to note, however, that if the dataset of human remains analysed is representative of the group originally buried in the Tomb during this phase, there was clear age selection, and possibly also gender selection, in terms of eligibility for inclusion (as sub-adults are greatly under represented and females outnumber males by 2:1 ). The bodies had received secondary burial treatment, as they were found disarticulated and mingled. Any later disturbances of this burial level would probably not have been sufficient to account for this disarticulation, which we may therefore accept as representing ritual secondary burial activity. It is likely that the bodies had previously been primary interments in the same tomb, rather than being transferred here from another location for secondary burial, since small bones were present which would be less likely to be transferred in the latter scenario (p. 70). It is also interesting to note that there is no evidence for receptacle use, which was a very common feature of contemporary burial activities at the nearby cemetery of Archanes Phourni. Knossos witnessed a period of dramatic population growth in the later 3rd and early 2nd millennia, and urbanisation was probably accompanied by great social and political upheaval, of which the MM IB palace was one product. The Tomb probably does not represent the uppermost elite of Knossian society in the late Prepalatial period, especially as it lacks the value-laden materials found with some of the Archanes burials (particularly metals, ivory and exotic stones). The assemblage consists mainly of ceramic vessels associated with pouring and drinking activities, suggesting a strong emphasis on rituals accompanying the primary and secondary interments, although at least two stone vessels may also be associated with this level (S4 and S71 in Chapter 4). However, the demographic growth and state formation processes at Knossos, particularly in this late Prepalatial period,1 would have had repercussions for the entire population, not just the elite minority; the prominent location of this Tomb 1 Whitelaw 2012.</page><page sequence="108">102 KNOSSOS MONASTIRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT ' in the local landscape, reinforced by conspicuous and repetitive funerary ceremonies at the site, may have been one reaction to population expansion and attendant social reconfigurations, with the tomb being used as a prominent statement of one kin group's claims to belong within this landscape. According to Hutchinson, the remains of this first phase of the Tomb's use were sealed and preserved under a layer of roof-collapse. The second phase of the Tomb's use was dated by Hutchinson, Karo, Marinatos and Payne to MM III, but it actually appears to encompass a broader time-range, from MM II to LM IA. It appears to be represented by more than one stratum, though their number and relationships are unclear and possibly varied in different areas of the Tomb. Overall, though, this phase is characterised by the presence of receptacle (pithos and probably tub larnax) burials, which were used from at least MM IIB until LM IA. If, as Hutchinson believed, the tomb's roof had collapsed by this point, the site was almost certainly at least partly open-air now, and indeed may have extended beyond the collapsed chamber. It is not possible to ascertain whether use of the site resumed immediately after the collapse, though there is no clear hiatus revealed by the dates of the ceramics. The assemblages of this second phase in the MK Tomb appear to have been more disturbed than those of first (late Prepalatial to MM IB) phase, on the basis of the much lower number of joins that can be found between ceramic sherds. This may have been due the digging of new pits for receptacle burials, which damaged pre-existing receptacle burials. This may also help to explain the presence of at least some of the late Prepalatial ceramics in SM boxes associated with the Tomb's upper strata, and later ceramics in boxes of 3rd stratum material, if such activities occasionally also penetrated through the collapsed-roof layer into the lowest level of the Tomb. It is not possible to ascertain with certainty whether primary burial had become the rule in the second phase of the Tomb's use, due to the paucity of available skeletal evidence, although the analysis of the human remains in box FA 15, which were associated with a 'MM III' pithos burial, shows that they could represent a primary single interment (p. 70).2 If, however, we do assume at the very least that receptacles were initially used for single primary interments, we have evidence for a minimum of 39 burials (34 pithoi and 5 larnakes) for the 1933 and 1935 excavations together. For the MM IB to LM IA periods, we have contemporary tomb evidence in the Knossos valley and at the neighbouring harbour town at Poros; however, most of these tombs still await full publication, and detailed comparison of burial habits and assemblages across all the cemetery sites is not yet possible. Two general observations can nevertheless be made, for the MM IIB-LM IA periods at least.3 One is that on present evidence, assemblage composition was, at a broad level at least, fairly similar across the different sites, at least for those materials which have been most frequently reported. 'High status' assemblages are rare. Objects of personal adornment were fairly common although usually not abundant. Within the MKTomb specifically, the Neopalatial stone seal is the most reliably datable example, possibly originally worn on a necklace, and displaying a female motif which was typical of the Knossos area (see detailed discussion in Chapter 4, pp. 60-3). Ceramic vessels form the largest category, usually in shapes associated with drinking and food preparation and consumption activities (though, as noted on pp. 64-5, the preserved faunal material does not provide positive evidence for funerary feasting). Stone vessels of various forms also occur fairly frequently (see S39, S40, S70 and S72 particularly as Neopalatial examples from the MKTomb; Chapter 4). Figurines occur in small numbers — the anthropomorphic clay and stone examples at MK (pp. 35 and 58-60 (S76)) were recovered from the upper levels of the Tomb, although both they and the zoomorphic figurines are difficult to date precisely. The second observation, however, against which to set these similarities in assemblage composition, concerns the marked differences in corpse treatment between the various Knossian cemeteries.4 For MM III at least, the period in which our evidence is most abundant, Upper Gypsades, to the south of the palace, has produced floor burials, possibly bound;5 larnax use was the norm at Ailias, on the eastern side of the Knossos valley;6 pithos use predominated in the Monastiriako Kephali tomb, and at Poros there were both floor burials and probably the occasional use of wooden biers.7 These significant differences in the treatment of the deceased reinforce the impression that the use of different hill-slopes as burial grounds was a purposeful expression of community divisions (probably between real or idealised extended kin networks), and these cemeteries potentially offer 2 Hutchinson's only field record mentions 'masses of bone' in the upper level (0-1.5 m depth; see p. 7); if human (and if different material from that in box FA 15), this could represent either disarticulated secondary burials or primary interments unintentionally disrupted by later burials and/or subsequent activities at the site. 3 See also Preston 2013. 4 See also Preston 2013. 5 Hood et al. 1959. 6 Hood (2010, 161 ) notes that at Ailias, larnax use replaced pithos use in MM III. Unfortunately, the situation at the Mavrospelio cemetery is less clear, partly due to the co occurrence of burial material from different periods in a number of the tombs. 7 Muhly 1992. Muhly records staples, probably from a wooden bier, in the lowest stratum of the pit in Poros tomb 2 (ibid., 36-7), which suggest the presence of this receptacle type already in the earliest (MM III) phase of the tomb's use.</page><page sequence="109">CONCLUSIONS 103 valuable insights into horizontal divisions within the Knossian population, which may have formed important social, political and economic structuring principles at this urban centre. As with the Tomb, interpretation of the Deposit is constrained by the lack of excavation records. It does appear to consist of re-deposited material, as Hutchinson believed, given the highly fragmentary nature of almost all of the finds. It is not clear, however, when this material was removed from its primary location(s), and whether this was in a single or multiple episodes. Given Hutchinson's observation of three distinguishable strata in the Deposit, plus a distinct LM IA deposit at the northern end of the site, there is a strong possibility that we are dealing with multiple horizons of deposition, which could potentially be from different sources. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to examine Hutchinson's LM IA deposit in more detail, as none of the SM boxes can be assigned to this context either by its ceramic contents or by its label. However, the three principal strata in the Deposit which Hutchinson observed, and dated to MM IIIB, are represented by specific SM boxes (see Appendix B). Hutchinson's MM IIIB dating for all three strata is overly precise (see table 5.2); nevertheless, it is notable that the catalogued material from the three boxes assigned to the 3rd and 2nd strata have a much more restricted chronological range (MM IIB to LM IA) than do the datable ceramics from the box assigned to the upper stratum, which range from late Prepalatial to post-Bronze Age. Moerover, it was suggested above (Chapter 5, p. 84) that the 'Stony layer/deposit' is closely related to, and indeed possibly the same context as, the 1st stratum, on the basis of sherd cross joins between the boxes; it is noteworthy that the chronological range of the datable ceramics is also similar. Overall, this may indicate both a separate deposition episode and a different source for the 3rd and 2nd strata on the one hand, and the upper-stratum/ stony-deposit on the other. The question of whether the Deposit material derives from domestic or mortuary sites, or a combination of both, also remains open. In LM III at least, there is almost certainly mortuary activity represented, as indicated by the presence of at least one chest larnax (a form not attested in domestic contexts). The swords, of which only the pommels remain, may equally have belonged to this or another burial of the Final Palatial or Postpalatial eras, as may the LM II—III pottery catalogued above (C480-C483). The early discovery of an LM II chamber tomb on the southern slope of the same hill (fig. 1.1 ; the 'Acropolis' tomb)8 demonstrates that this area did have mortuary associations after the Neopalatial period. Moreover, the presence of weaponry in this grave (two swords and three spearheads) lends further support to the interpretation of the Deposit's sword-pommels as mortuary artefacts (a bronze spearhead accidentally recovered roughly 100 m west of the Deposit site may mark the site of a further such LM II/III tomb: FIG. 1.1 Site 138). As noted above (Chapters 1 and 5), Hutchinson described only Neopalatial material from the site, and he interpreted it as a secondary deposit from a domestic context further up the slope to the south east; Hood, by contrast, also noted the presence of much earlier material and proposed a mortuary interpretation for the corpus as a whole. Hutchinson's report does not mention any signs of a tomb structure at the site, but such would not be expected of a deposit no longer in sitir, rather, this material may have eroded downslope or been looted from one or more destroyed chamber tombs or, indeed, an open-air cemetery of pithos graves. The late Prepalatial to Neopalatial material in the SM collection does not definitively point to either a domestic or a mortuary function, though it is notable that the forms present are generally very similar to those of the corresponding phases in the Tomb (Chapters 3 and 5). One drawback we currently face with this question is the low number of recently excavated and thoroughly published domestic or mortuary assemblages from Protopalatial and Neopalatial Knossos which can provide detailed comparanda for the Deposit material.9 However, our present evidence suggests that a broadly similar range of ceramic forms can occur in both types of context (for example, the MK Tomb demonstrates that cooking wares are not exclusive to domestic assemblages, and the Poros tomb n 1967 suggests the same for loomweights).10 Thus it may prove to be the case that relative proportions of different fabrics, shapes and wares in ceramic assemblages will provide a more sensitive indicator of site function than mere presence or absence. The stone vessels, which show a broad diachronic range from late Prepalatial to Neopalatial, also display close comparability with the Tomb material (see Chapters 4 and 5) and could be compatible overall with either a domestic or mortuary interpretation, although individual forms vary as to whether their presently known Cretan parallels are principally mortuary or domestic. The stone 'tools' too are inconclusive. Several other potential mortuary sites have also been identified on the MK hill, apart from the LM II chamber tomb discussed above. A possible rock-cut chamber tomb on the northern side of the hill was reportedly 8 PMIV, 849; Hood and Smyth 1981, 45 no. 149. 9 See also Preston 2005, 84. Exceptions include the Protopalatial 'KV' trial (Popham 1974) and Neopalatial 'Acropolis houses' (Catling et al. 1979); the Neopalatial Poros tomb n 1967 provides a valuable mortuary dataset (Muhly 1992), which is supplemented particularly by Alberti's re study of the retained Mavrospelio material (Alberti 2001). 10 Muhly 1992, 102 no. 314, 142; although, unfortunately, this occurs in a context which is difficult to date.</page><page sequence="110">104 KNOSSOS MONASTJRIAKO KEPHALI TOMB AND 'DEPOSIT' examined but not fully excavated by Hutchinson in 1935 (FIG. 1.1 Site 137). A further tomb is recorded in the second Knossos survey on the eastern edge of the hill (Site 148), reportedly excavated by Nicholas Platon in 1940 and found to contain pithos burials. However, no records by Platon have been found for this site.11 Hood suggests that it may be identifiable with a possible tomb noted by Hutchinson on the 'west crest' of the hill in the same year,12 but equally, it may be a conflation of the aforementioned rock-cut chamber on the north edge of the hill or, more probably, the 1933 tests in the MK Tomb itself. On the upper east slope of the hill an emptied chamber tomb was identified by Hood in 1963 (Site 371), while several further possible tombs may have been located nearby (Site 147, although Hood notes that these have not been reliably identified). Finally, the minutes of a meeting of the BSA Managing Committee in December 1956 mention 'MM I tombs by fallen cave on NE slope of Monasteriako Kephali' as a possible site for excavation, although no further information is known, and this may correspond with one of the tomb sites discussed above.13 These sites, although unconfirmed, alert us to the possibility that the MK Tomb was by no means an isolated phenomenon, but that the Monastiriako Kephali hill accommodated a broader cemetery (or cemeteries) in the MM and early LM periods — perhaps akin to those on the Ailias slope which mirror the Monastiriako Kephali hill on the eastern side of the valley. 11 Preston, 2013: table 6.4 site MKi. 12 Hood and Smyth 1981, 45. 13 BSAarchives: 'Minutes ofBSA Managing Committee 1945 61': 'Minutes 1956-61'.</page><page sequence="111">Appendix A Monastiriako Kephali Deposit Stratigraphical Museum box labels italics indicate notes by the author = letter(s) or word(s) illegible (?) = reading uncertain The labels were written in black ink, unless otherwise stated: [wc] = white chalk; [be] = blue chalk; [p] = pencil; [ri] = red ink; [bi] = blue ink; [ip] = black ink label written over same label in pencil Box Exterior label (front) Exterior label Exterior label Exterior label Interior labels (side) (side) (back) 1683 T.II.l K333 MM III pithos burials on Acropolis 1684 T.II.l K333 MM III pithos burials on Acropolis 1685 T.II.l K333 MM III pithos burials on Acropolis 1686 T.II.l K333 MM III pithos burials on Acropolis 1687 T.II.l K333 MM III pithos burials on Acropolis FA 1 F.A.I 252 1935/3 Tomb Mon Monasteriako Kephali: Tomb.
