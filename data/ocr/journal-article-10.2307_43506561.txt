<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vidas Secas: A Deconstructable Narrative? Introduction The Brazilian writer Graciliano Ramos, particularly through his novel Vidas Secas ("Barren Lives"), has been viewed by some critics from a sociological viewpoint, either as a denouncer of the decaying rural feudalism in northeast Brazil since the Revolution of 1930 and of its dictatorial gov- ernment, or as a critic of the reification of the individual inside a social system which has been considered mainly res- ponsible for the human degradation in that region. It is true that Vidas Secas deals with these problems and also with questions of the absurdity of human life; however, it appears that the novel also relies on itself as a text and on the question of communication, where the narrative technique seems to move hand-in-hand with the development of character and situation. Affonso Romano de Santana, for example, has already interpreted Ramos' novel using the structuralist ap- proach, but a consistent application of Greimas' method both shows the limitations of other structuralist analyses and at the same time serves as a bridge between the sociological and structuralist interpretations of Vidas Secas. This paper will explore the implications of this latter proposition. A few lines will be dedicated to the explanation of the methodology of A. -J. Greimas' Sémantique Struturale - Re- cherche de Méthode , and, thereafter, we will discuss both the structure of the narrative and how the characters are man- ipulated as technical devices within the narrative. Whenever it is convenient and necessary, the method applied in this paper will appeal to other structuralist schemes in order to make clear its fundamental claims. It is not the aim of this paper to enter into analytical details of Greimas' theoretical methodology, but rather to utilize it to explain the narrative of Vidas Secas. - 57 -</page><page sequence="2">The Method The theoretical contribution of the Russian formalists, particularly of Tomashevsky, Eichenbaum and Shlovsky, has been correctly considered to be fundamental to the develop- ment of modern literary criticism, and it has reached its real value in the Western world in past decades primarily through linguistic studies which have brought a new perspective to the rereading of literary texts. A. -J. Greimas in his most impor- tant studies, Sémantique Struturale 1 and Du Sens, 2 reanalyzes the work of Vladimir Propp and offers a theory of literary interpretation based on the analysis of functions. He attempts to reduce the series of agents which act inside the text to a single model. Greimas, in Sémantique Struturale, reduces the elements previously rendered by Propp and Souriau into a set of six agents (actants) which organize themselves around a search. In his scheme there is a subject (the hero, as in a folktale), an object (the beloved princess), an addresser (the king who fights in order to conceal the object), an addressee (the people threatened by a dragon who profit by the hero's victory), an opponent (the evil forces which oppose themselves to the hero's goal) and an assistant (the good forces which show the hero the way to victory). The reduction of a narrative into these elements allows the critic to work within a generative model. The literary work is created as a fundamental project, sometimes involuntary, which renders possible the production of a certain number of enunciative components. The central theme of Greimas' work is the questioning of the phenomenon of meaning, a central question today in all human sciences. C'est dans le récherche portant sur la signification que les sciences humaines peuvent trouver leur dénomin- ateur commun. En effect, si les sciences de la nature s'interrogent pour savoir comment sont l'homme et le monde, les sciences de l'homme se posent, de façon plus ou moins explicite, la question de savoir ce qu'il sig- nifient l'un et l'autre.3 - 58 -</page><page sequence="3">Within the general aim of the human sciences Greimas finds that the basic objective of semantics is to question itself about the problem of meaning inside the boundaries of language. Semantic research verifies itself on two different levels: the first is the goal of the research, the language in question; the second is the quality of the linguistic instruments to be em- ployed in its description consisting of a metalanguage. We infer within metalinguistics a difference between the language in question and the linguistic instrument, both of which are to be understood as concepts present inside the language; these concepts, however, are not subject to analysis, for they precede any analysis. It is exactly the fact of preceding analysis that gives the concepts their metalinguistic charac- teristics and situates them on a higher theoretical level. Nevertheless, these metalinguistic concepts are also subject to verification and experimentalization. Therefore, this meta- linguistics implies the existence of a meta-metalinguistics: a third level or epistemological language whose aim is to verify the internal unity of the conceptual instrument of analysis. Greimas establishes a difference between what is under- stood as metalinguistic unities, i.e., operational unities, and the lexemes which belong to the language-object and become reality in the discourse itself. Semes organize themselves into semic categories and the relationships among them in the interior of this category will be defined by the opposition they present among themselves. This relation is understood as antonymic: identity /difference or conjunction/disjunction. Although these categories (semes) belong to the language- object they can only be formulated (as with the lexemes) outside the language-object. Therefore, they are part, like the semes, of metalinguistics. All semantic description is thus metalinguistic in the sense that "aucun sème ou catégorie sémique, même si sa dénomination est empruntée a la langue française [or Portuguese, English, etc.] n'est identique en principe a un lexème manifesté dans le discours" (p. 34). As a substitute for the term lexeme, borrowed from linguistics, Greimas proposes semene: a unit of discourse constituted of one seme and one contextual seme or classeme. The seme, ac- - 59 -</page><page sequence="4">cording to Greimas, renders count of the realization oř pos- sible semes within the elementary structure; it consists of an axis of semic probabilities, inside a lexeme or semene. The contextual seme, in its turn, renders count of the contexts which involve the seme; the classeme permits us to assign the semene an equal meaning. After having touched upon the operational concepts which constitute the metalinguistic substratum for the semantic des- cription, let us focus, following Greimas, on its object: the discourse. The first task of an analyst is the division of anal- ysable units, since they present themselves in different dimen- sions: they may be constituted by a single term or by a locution. Greimas utilizes for a better understanding of these unities the notion of isotopy, the equalness of meaning that exists among those different messages, in terms of formation and extension. The understanding and the recognition of these isotopie dimensions presuppose, before a full realiza- tion, the description of the metalinguistic function of the discourse. This latter bases itself on the principle of expansion, i.e., in the recognition that . . .le discours, conçu comme une hiérarchie des unités de communication s'emboîtant les unes dans les autres, contient en lui la négation de cette hiérarchie, du fait que les unités de communication de dimensions différentes peuvent en même temps être reconnues comme équiva- lentes. (P. 72) In Greimas' scheme, because the expansion can bear the same meaning of a condensation, the discourse can function metalinguistically. This way a denomination, a word x, may be substituted or may have the same meaning as a definition: a statement is constituted by the words fl + fo + c. This is the procedure of the metalinguistic functioning of the discourse, according to Greimas, in which the definition is considered as metalanguage in its relation to the denomination. This guar- antees the isotopy of messages which consist of different dimensions. It is this sort of linguistic isotopy that exists between a denomination: competition , and a definition: - 60 -</page><page sequence="5">sportive match; the identity between the two systems oř meaning is given by what Greimas calls "possession en commun de plusiers sèmes identiques" (p. 79). The common possession of various identical semes constitutes the classematic basis to the semantic analysis. This can be illustrated by the following figure: Figure 1: Ëansion ¡nitior^ ^denomjriatiorj condensation I ¡nitior^ ^denomjriatiorj metalinguistic functioning of the discourse After dealing with the conceptual repertoire and its operational basis, defined by Greimas as the isotopy of discourse between condensation and expansion, denomination and definition, this paper will focus briefly on the description of meaning. This description consists, according to Greimas, of an arrangement of the semenes between two major groups in which the classeme leads to a cosmological dimension responsible for the knowledge of the exterior world; it also can lead to a noological dimension responsible for the understanding of the interior world. In Greimas' words, ... le description achevée de la dimension cosmologique constituerait la cosmologie épuisant la connaissance du monde exterieur. La description complète de la dimen- sion noologique constituerait, dans les mêmes condi- tions, la noologie rendant entièrement compte du monde intérieur. (P. 120) Nevertheless, these two semantic universes never appear in their full potential in the object under analysis, but rather in microuniverses whose manifestation corresponds to the limited descriptive corpus. Greimas explains that "La man- ifestation partielle de la dimension cosmologique sera dite manifestation pratique , et la manifestation partielle de la - 61 -</page><page sequence="6">dimension noologique, manifestation mythy que" (p. 120). We will deal with these two categories when focusing on the two actant levels of the narrative in Graciliano Ramos' Vidas Secas. Greimas divides the unities of the manifestation modes into two basic groups: the first renders count of discrete unities or actants, the second of integrality or predicate. The combin- ation of the actants and the predicates constitute a major unity known as message. The predicate may embody staticity or dynamism; the dynamic predicate points to the function of the actants, the static one points to its qualification. Both the practical and mythic fictionalizations may be constituted by either dynamic messages pointing to the universe of trans- formation and change, or by qualificative messages pointing to the universe of constancy or permanence. It is from the predominance of one of these types of messages - dynamic or static, functional or qualitative - that it is possible for the analyst to establish the typology of the afictional micro- universes. The following figure systematizes Greimas' theoretical statements: Figure 2 models ► functional qualitative manifestation practical technologic scientific mythic ideologic axiologic The narrative of Vidas Secas deals primarily with the cos- mologica! dimension in spite of its function as an instrument rendering count of the addresser's myth. Because the func- tional message dominates the discourse of Vidas Secas it belongs to the ideologic typology. Before turning to the analysis of the text itself, it is neces- sary to summarize Greimas' methodology, or the procedures for the analysis of the text in question. Greimas' method proposes the following steps: 1. The option of the deductive system for the elaboration of the concepts described above. This does not mean the - 62 -</page><page sequence="7">elimination of the inductive process; it does not mean to reject verifying in reality (given a text or language- object) the conceptual repertory. 2. Elaboration of the corpus to be studied which Greimas defines as a set of messages contained in the description of the linguistic model in mind. This corpus is always partial, according to Greimas, but must be representa- tive to allow later comparisons and generalizations when contrasted to other corpuses. 3. The messages have to be listed and then reduced to a comprehensible set. 4. From the reduction of the inventory of messages, its structuralization follows which allows the elaboration of its model. Since we will examine the phases referring to the structure of Graciliano Ramos' text and to its characters, this introductory presentation of Greimas' model will make it unnecessary to describe these different steps when dealing with the text. The Narrative Vidas Secas (1938) is Ramos' fourth novel. The novels plot deals with the simplicity of the northeastern region of Brazil. In the place of the long detours which characterize realist novels from the period of the formation and rising of the bourgeoisie, we have in Vidas Secas an almost linear reality - without intensive dramatic conflicts - which is limited to a short period in the life of a peasant family moving away from drought and its agricultural consequences. Expelled by the drought, Fabiano, his wife, two boys, a dog and a parrot emigrate searching for a more favorable region to settle in. They found an abandoned farm in which Fabiano works after making some arrangement with the owner of the land, always absent and distant. With the return of the drought, they are obliged to leave the farm and to emigrate again; this time (the end of the novel) they are not searching for another farm but travelling south. The novel takes place between the two droughts whose cyclical repetition constitutes an epic picture in which human actions are inserted. The whole novel takes place in a period - 63 -</page><page sequence="8">we can call provisory tor Fabiano. Ramos relates, in an or- ganically coherent structure, the various problems which typify the agrarian universe of that region in Brazil: the social exploitation, the loneliness of the characters, the contradic- tory awareness (between passivity and revolt) of the Brazilian peasant, the frustration of even his most insignificant aspirations, his possibilities (concrete or abstract) of transcending a situation of misery. Fabianos nomadism is related to the phenomenon of drought only on a surface level. When analyzed more deeply, his nomadism is linked primarily to the fact that Fabiano is not an owner of property, a fact that prohibits him from settling down on the land. Furthermore, the low level of agrarian technological resources is responsible for the apparent impotence of the peasants. All these facts make Fabiano's life on the farm temporary. The whole situation of the working class of that region may be understood in terms of recurring images: what is happening to Fabiano might be happening to other families of the same economic and cul- tural level. In this sense, a single narrative is not composed but rather nuclear narratives. The events in general end up in themselves, not occupying a specific place in a chain. When they do so, they have only short-run consequences, which are never made interesting to the reader. Only twice in the entire book, in the reappearance of the Yellow Soldier and in the second drought, is the subject matter of one chapter part of the motif of another one. The author, in abolishing the notion of narrative continuity, makes the text turn to itself. The various movements of the novel are constituted of pieces which turn in slow motion around an axis (e.g., the chapter dedicated to the dog, Beleia). It is through this turning-on-its- own-axis theme that the narrative ends up dealing not only with the problems of the Brazilian peasant but also with the problems of communication, and of language. Rui Mourão appropriately said that " Vidas Secas , antes de qualquer outra coisa, é o drama de uma impossibilidade de comunicaçao humana."4 Fabiano, Sinhá Vitória, the two boys and Baleia are a solitary group; nevertheless, the more they seem united in the common occupation of surviving in a common - 64 -</page><page sequence="9">economy and affection, the more tfiey remain isolated within themselves, each one forming an entity. They do not com- municate with each other. Significantly enough, each of them has a special chapter in the novel, and language is Fabiano's primary preoccupation. We shall return to this problem in the final part of this paper. The construction of Vidas Secas establishes the following different phases in the narrative structure: 1. Rupture of equilibrium. 2. Wandering of the characters = search of an object which will be defined little by little. 3. An attempt of setting down ~ the threat of loss of equilibrium. 4 . Failure of equilibrium because of the number of obsta- cles to overcome = oppressive forces. 5 . Characters return to wandering, but this time to escape from the oppressive forces. Apparently, the novel's structure assumes what most critics have interpreted as a cyclical movement; however, its move- ment is really elliptical rather than cyclical, since at the end of the novel the characters do not repeat the same journey - they do not look for a new land in the countryside to settle down- but rather they move away from the region, looking for a city "in the south" where they can settle. It is true that between the beginning of the story and its end almost nothing happens, and that the action of the first chapter "Mudança" ('Moving') is very similar to the last one "Fuga" ('Escape'). However, between these two titles there is the loss of a semantic com- ponent. In its semantic set of meanings the word " mudança " forshadows a change which might be positive or negative, but it does not imply the total elimination of the same conditions under which the characters have lived. It translates a possibil- ity of hope, or at least the change of hope. (In this case, illusion and dream, since the ecological, social and psycho- logical conditions remain the same.) "Fuga", however, announces an unpredictable objective which leads to a defin- ite instability and, therefore, it does not imply any acknow- ledgeable hope, nor illusory dreams of modifying that specific situation. It also implies, and herein lies the basic difference - 65 -</page><page sequence="10">between the end oř the novel and its beginning, that the con- ditions will not remain the same for the characters, since "fuga" means an escape in absolute terms from a certain situation, and a rejection, again in absolute terms, of an existential condition. It is through this absolute negation of hope and opportunity that Vidas Secas tells us of a new horizon which will become reality. The attitude of Fabiano at the end of the novel differs greatly from that at the beginning. The criticism of Vidas Secas brings to the fore two aspects which appear important in this discussion: first, that the novel is able to be deconstructed, following Rubem Braga's5 observation repeated by the majority of the critics. Antonio Cândido,6 examining this topic more deeply, postulates that Vidas Secas' structure of small juxtaposed pictures reminds us of the medieval triptyches in which the life of a saint or hero is organized in a rather free set of unities. Mr. Cândido refers to Vidas Secas triptychal or rosaceous since, according to his view, the end of the narrative coincides with its beginning, repeating the eternal return form; secondly, we find critics who define Vidas Secas as ahistoric and claim that the story itself is secondary since it lacks the traditional plot with its mechanism of climax and anticlimax, which reduces every- thing to the characters and their feelings. Based on Greimas' method, a reexamination of the nar- rative structural division becomes necessary. It seems more accurate to divide the novel into two major parts, each presenting a distinct moment: the first part ranging from Chapter One to Chapter Eight, and the second from Chapter Nine (Baleia s death) to the end. The concept of permutability that Brazilian structuralist criticism has applied to the entire novel seems applicable only between the two different sets of chapters; i.e., Chapters One through Nine can be permuted only among themselves and not with those of the second part. To permute, chapters of the first part with the ones after Baleias death, as most have proposed, would confuse the reader's understanding of events, as well as damaging the semantic levels of the narrative. It would be confusing to have a chapter after Baleia's death (dealing with Fabianos reflection about the dog) inserted among chapters where the - 66 -</page><page sequence="11">dog is still alive and playing an important role in the plot. Another distinctive aspect of the internal structure of the narrative which reflects upon Fabiano s change is the fact that in the first part of Vidas Secas the ideologic contents are made apparent; in the second, these ideologic contents are questioned. It is true, though, that the notion of permuta- bility cannot be applied to the chapter of the narrative as a whole, but the same is not valid in respect to the permuta- bility of its characters, as we shall see later. In addition, Greimas' notion of transformation, as part of the narrative construction, is applicable to Vidas Secas . This transformation becomes particularly apparent in the recur- rence of the novel's primary motif. This recurrence is typical of Ramos' technique and it assumes a different form according to the work in question. In the analysis of the sen- tence or the word, Ramos uses transformations in the following ways: in the neurotic process of association of ideas we find in Luis dä Silva (Angústia); in the author's use of one or more characters repeatedly in one or more words (Infancia/ Angústia), and sometimes even in some of the episodes that are retold with slight variation (Infancia/ Vidas Secas). In Vidas Secas there are fourteen recurrent motifs. In general, they occur throughout the novel, appearing either isolated or transformed into other motifs: 1. dried landscape 2. buzzards looking for dead bodies 3. zoomorphization and anthropomorphization of beings 4. reification of human beings 5. problem of discourse and expression of the characters 6. silence in nature and characters 7. parrot 8. fragmentary thoughts of the characters 9. Seu Tomás 10. the red twiggy dress of Vitoria 11. the wooden bed of Vitoria 12. oppressive owner of the property - boss - 67 -</page><page sequence="12">13. dead snakes in the yard 14. Yellow Soldier The number of motifs, as Greimas states, is variable. It de- pends on the process of selecting the corpus of analysis. One could add to the above list at lease five other motifs which could be called motif-characters:7 15. Fabiano 16. Baleia 17. Vitória 18. Older boy 19. Younger boy Applying the principles of transformation, these motifs can be inserted in the fourteen other ones. The author gives each of these motif-characters a special chapter and the story is retold five different times from each point of view. Ramos' technique here is very similar to that adopted by William Faulkner in As I Lay Dying , published in 1930. It is, however, very unlikely that Ramos knew Faulkner's novel. The probable model for both Faulkner and Ramos is Sterne's Tristam Shandy. It is in the mind of these motif -characters that most of the other motifs take place and permute them- selves in the process of constructing the story. The most frequent motifs coincide with our focus of study in this paper: anthropo- and zoomorphism are present in all chapters and "discourse" and are only left out of Chapter Nine. If, on the one hand, the motifs are permutable from chapter to chapter, then they, on the other hand, are not only connected with a single motif-character, but may relate to more than one actant. Similarly, the character may be related to more than one of these motifs. Therefore, motifs and char- acters do not appear exclusively in reciprocal relation and may exclude other combinations. A motif may also be con- nected both to character A and to character B, C, or D. There is a large field of permutational movement between and among motifs and characters. The movements of these com- binations confirm the importance of recurrent motifs which function structurally as substitutes for dramatic actions, and for decharacterization which make the characters figures which may later become motifs. This narrative procedure is also responsible for the lack of - 68 -</page><page sequence="13">individuality in the characters. It demonstrates in this way that the individual contains universal rather than particular characteristics. It explains, as well, the presence of the permu- tational model responsible for the binary combination man/animal. In a way, traditional critics have not been com- pletely wrong when they talk about the deconstructable char- acteristic of Vidas Secas. Their mistake resides only in their disregard of the semantic differentiation between the first and second parts of the novel. Having focused on the semantic meaning and on the struc- tural arrangement of the motifs in Vidas Secas , we can then turn to the level of character. Characters appear individually in each narrative and may be classified, according to Greimas, in determined groups according to their common characteristics: they constitute the general category of actants. Greimas proposes through this distinction to separate the individuals (actors) from its generalization, classifying them in specific groups, according to their common features. The starting point for elaboration of the actants' groups was adopted by Greimas from Etienne Souriau's and Vladimir Propp's theoretical conclusions. Propp examined similar questions starting from a specific corpus. Souriau used dramatic literature whereas Propp analyzed a set of Russian folktales. After studying the set of characters arranged by Souriau and Propp, Greimas deduces six elementary kinds of actants which he conceives of in three pairs: Figure 4 addressor ► object ► addressee assistant ^ subject M opponent Applying these categories to the narrative of Vidas Secas , we can state that the actants who function in the search scheme proposed by the narrator are precisely defined. Using Greimas' model of function, we have the following pattern: a. A subject. Actants composed of the elements which assume the form of family characters: Fabiano, Sinhá Vitoria, the Older Boy, the Younger Boy, the dog Baleia and, finally, the parrot. It is significant to consider the dog and the parrot - 69 -</page><page sequence="14">as members oř the family because the narrator-author tells us to proceed this way at the beginning of the novel. b. An object. This object assumes various forms and is defined by the searching for the promised land; either it is the farm, the object proposed at the beginning of the novel, or the south at the end of it. c. An addresser. A provocative agent who stimulates the subject to initiate his search and who imposes certain con- ditions on him. The addresser assumes on one level of the narrative the drastic drought phenomenon. It acts twice in the novel: it stimulates the subject to begin his wandering and de- fines his searches. d. An addressee. An agent who will profit by the achieve- ment of an object. In Vidas Secas this agent is the subject himself (the family). e. An opponent. It embodies the set of elements which prevents the subject from obtaining the desired object. In our narrative this opponent includes hostility, nature, society, the oppressive boss, and the arbitrary social order - all of which we may synthesize as "oppressive forces". f. An assistant. In Vidas Secas the assistant is not strong enough to provide sufficient help to the subject to settle down. Like the mundanca (changing') of seasons, all are temporary and unable to help the subject attain the object. These features may be understood as deceiving stimuli. "Fuga" leads us beyond the narrative, and its value as an as- sistant is uncertain and imprecise. It is possible to elaborate the following scheme: Figure 5 addresser: ^ object: land, addressee: the drought settling down the hero A assistant: subject: opponent: deceiving stimuli ^ the hero ^ oppressive forces This model is unquestionable if one keeps the surface struc- - 70 -</page><page sequence="15">ture of the text in mind. However, if one considers that the elliptical construction of the novel transports the subject from a state of affairs dominated by illusory hopes and dreams to another, slightly but significantly different from the first, at the end of the novel, and if one considers Claude Bremond's scheme8 for the analysis of characters in fictional narratives, one may examine this new phase as twofold, one positive and the other negative: the attainment of desires (flight), and the new defeat similar to the first one. Readers are invited to decipher the code presented by the text, and in this way they can refuse the role of the "deceived" assumed by the subject. A plot of this texture, when relegated to the secondary plane, is composed of the distribution of the agents which may depart from Greimas' model but may fit into Bremond's model, which encompasses all the addresser's alternatives; the deep structure of the narrative is thus reached. Thus, the text tries to compromise the reader with a fight which would call his attention to the social conditions of the northeastern man's life, and denounce the state of oppression and misery of a whole region of Brazil. The hero's effort at awareness translates itself through a set of questions whose answers are not given. The problems seem to have easy solu- tions, but these are not made clear to the reader. This novel is built around silence, and the narrator's questions, thus obliging readers to meditate. It aims to extract from them the expected answers. The search assumes a new dimension in the deep structure of the text: the object-land which was of primary importance is relegated to a secondary level. The text assumes the first plane and organizes itself as a texture in whose plot the actants are distributed around an axis situated at the same level of the searching object. The actual narrative is built up in parallel fashion to its surface level and the nar- rator becomes the stimulative agent of the search. The real addresser is responsible for sending the subject to search the hailing object from which he himself will profit. The novel is constructed, thus, of successive reductions that damage the elements of the evident and superficial structure in order to bring out its latent deep structure. In the deep structure the "installation" of the subject is no longer an - 71 -</page><page sequence="16">end in itself and becomes a pretext which allows the definition of the real object: the narrative process. Thus, the successive reductions of the surface structure of the narrative lead to the negation of that same level of the text. Its elliptical nature asks for a rereading of the text in search of a real narrative. It is in the sphere of the subject that those reductions turn out to be more evident. The sketchy technique used for describing the characters is already a hint of this reduction; even the vo- cabulary used emphasizes the miserable state of the hero who moves to and from the levels of man and animal, from the realm of aspiration to that of degradation, in Bremond's terms (pp. 282-294). The following scheme clarifies the char- acter s situation in the narrative: Fabiano: + human + language aspiration. Vitória: + human + bed + animal Fabiano: + Baleia (dog) degradation. -h animal Vitória: -h parrot Fabiano ± human Vitória ± human Figure 6 - 72 -</page><page sequence="17">The basic opposition in this mythical world, the binary model man /animal, is similarly discussed by Affonso Romano de Santana in his Análise Estrutural de Romances Brasileiros (p. 154), in which he considers the + human char- acters as one mathematical set opposed to the -human ones as a second set. There is an explicit tendency for the first set to become the second, and vice-versa. One may agree with Mr. Santana that through an evolution of vertical and horizontal reasonings on those two sets, maintaining the same para- digms, it is possible to better understand the equilibrium between these two poles on the semantic level of the novel. Throughout the novel the components of subset one, + human, are identified with the elements of subset two, -human; i.e., Fabiano and Sinhá Vitória, as well as the older and the younger boys possess the qualities given to both Baleia (the dog) and the parrot. They, then, appear to strive for higher goals, to ascend to + human. In the realm of de- gradation Baleia and the parrot refer to Fabiano and Sinhá Vitória, especially in the chapter dedicated to Fabiano. In the realm of aspirations the referent is, in the case of Fabiano, the linguistic ability of Seu Tomás for whom Fabiano greatly ad- mires, and often whom Fabiano models himself in his en- deavor to become a real human being. Fabiano thinks what he lacks is the ability to speak and to reason as Seu Tomás does (Vidas Secas, p. 25). In the case of Sinhá Vitoria her great aspiration of becoming a real human being is related to owning a bed like the one Seu Tomás has. For Fabiano dis- course is the chief differentiation of + or - humanness; for Vitoria it is the economic status, a bed made of leather (com- fort) to replace her miserable bare/ wooden one. Here in the realm of actants Fabiano and Sinhá Vitoria are to a large ex- tent permutable; however, discourse is quantitatively and qualitatively more significant for the novelist and for the characters, as we shall see. Not only are Fabiano and Sinhá Vitoria potentially permutable between themselves in this oscillation between the + and - human axis, but the other characters of the study, the younger and the older boys, who do not even have proper names, are also permutable. Like their parents, their levels of aspiration and degradation center - 73 -</page><page sequence="18">around the same object in the entire text. The characters could be perfectly represented as a , b, c, d, considering that anub, c^d, b^c. It is this phenomenon of permutability which gives a sense of eternal return to the novels construction, a fact emphasized by critics. The boys are depicted most of the time as having the same quality of the parents, without any variation either in the past or the future. The characters circulate in a closed universe where the extremes are almost equalized, as already noted in the dis- cussion of the elliptical construction of the narrative. Fabiano talks about the future and confuses it with the past. The sit- uation has been the same for generations: Esses movimentos eram inúteis, mas o vaqueiro, o pai do vaqueiro, o avô e outros antepassados mais antigos haviam-se acostumado a percorrer veredas, afastando o mato com a mao ... 10 (P. 18) Os meninos eram uns brutos, como o pai. Quando crescessem, guardariam as reses de um patrao invisível, seriam pisados, maltratados por um soldado amarelo.11 (P. 40) If it is clear that characters may be permutable between themselves, it is likewise evident that the -human elements, whether animal, vegetable or object and landscape, also alternate, assuming each others' characteristics. And finally, if one temporarily overlooks the distinctive feature of discourse which determines meaningful internal changes in the narrative and points to the level of reification denounced in the novel, these last elements which I would label x, w, y, z are permutable with those first a, b, c, d. This way the anthropomorphism and zoomorphism become a constant in the narrative, one acting metaphorically upon the other. In this scheme not only have a^b, b^c and c^d, but also a^b^c^d^x^y^z.

In these oppositions the second element is nothing but the negation of the first one, which seems to imply the identification of the + and - signs. This way, the actions of the characters cannot be denied but the progress of their difficult actions goes hand- in-hand with stones and animals. In the heart of the narrative action becomes its negation. The subject of the action moves from possessor to possessed and lacks the basic characteristics that may define him as a human being. This is why Sinhá Vitória understands that she can only be a human being if she has a bed like Seu Tomás does; she overlooks the Marxist distinctions between being and having. Sinhá Vitoria is des- cribed as 'nao diferenciava muito da bolandeira de Seu Tomás"16 (p. 49). This kind of reification assumes its climax in Fabiano whom Ramos describes as "uma coisa de fazenda, um traste"17 (p. 52). Fabiano is thus reified and becomes iden- tified with and possessed by a mere thing, a discarded object. Reification of the characters in Vidas Secas leads us back to the question of lack of communication among the human ele- ments of the narrative and to the novels construction in iso- lated chapters (only two chapters deal with part of the same motif). It also leads us to the question of discourse, a constant motif in the text, as we have seen in Figure 3 above. The anal- ysis of the subset + human, where we have compared - 75 -</page><page sequence="20">Fabiano with Baleia and Vitória with the parrot, shows us that anthropo- and zoomorphism are rendered possible inside the narrative through the absence of speech /awareness which defines man in opposition to animal (following Fabiano's own reason). It is the inability of Fabiano and Vitória throughout most of the narrative to articulate as subjects which reduces them to object and equalizes them with nature. The existential impotence of the characters stands for their verbal impotence in their everyday relations. They communicate through gesture and animalized guttural sounds, are unable to organize the world into a representational and ideal system, and behave like objects which may be permutable in time and space. This lack of communication is treated differently in the chapter "Fuga" where Fabiano and Sinhá Vitória will be able to talk to each other for hours and hours, forgetting time and conquering miles in their journey to the South. When speech becomes primarily an instrument for com- merce and capitalism, and both Fabiano and his family fail to convey meaning, they return to their limited group, to their isolation. Metaphorically speaking, we can say that the char- acters' thoughts are as "deconstructed" as the surface of the narrative itself. They operate in a way very similar to collage. Also in the realm of their thoughts the world is deconstructed, its parts put together without any sense of priority. Signifier and signified are placed on a single plane. For Sinhá Vitória, for instance, wedding parties, rodeos, mass, are confused and confusing. She is not able to decode their difference. When Fabiano is arrested and put in jail, he sees everything as part of a single level. His ideas are isolated sentences, inarticulated segments in constant permutation; signifier and signified do not have any precise boundaries. Thus, the only aim of the novel is not the search for the prom- ised land which will allow the subjects to settle down. The successive reductions of the subjects and the continuous alien- ation of their belongings bring them to self-destruction and reification, and make it impossible for them to achieve higher good, that is speech; and their liberation will only become a reality when they achieve this ultimate good - speech for the characters, and discourse for the writer. Therefore, as a result - 76 -</page><page sequence="21">of the transformations and permutations of the fundamental model, the object is not defined as a concrete final product (a leather bed or a farm), but as a total definitive and, therefore, liberati ve good: discourse. The first chapters of the narrative whose aim is to deter- mine the qualities of the subject are stressed by the absolute lack of communication among the characters, a lack of com- munication caused by the absolute absence of means of ex- pression. This surely does not mean that the necessity of com- munication is not present, but rather that it is not set in concrete terms. E Fabiano foi sentar-se na calçada, resolvido a conversar. O vocabulário dele era pequeno mas em horas de comunicabilidade enriquecia-se com algumas expressões de Seu Tomás da bolandeira.18 (P. 63) Fabianos attitude in borrowing Seu Tomás' expression demonstrates that he has an undeveloped sense of language and misuses terminology with which he is not familiar and which, indeed, causes him certain fear and anxiety. His lan- guage is a disconnected set of words which is never realized. It is a chewing of isolated segments of speech better character- ized by its disjunctive structure: Isto é. Vamos e nao vamos. Quer dizer. Enfim, contando, etc. E conforme.19 (P. 63) In the linguistic realm of the narrative, everything happens as if each character has a special and different code and as if its deciphering is not only impossible but also not useful. Characters try, through different methods, to overcome their problems of communication. In a major effort, they substitute primitive sounds, lacking any semantic expression, for words. They speak louder and louder in their attempt to make themselves understood, but soon their voices become weaker and weaker and their guttural noise gives place to absolute silence. In this silence each step means alienation and loss of the desired object. Only with 'Tuga", when these - 77 -</page><page sequence="22">characters escape to the South, do they seem to approach their liberating object: speech. Their consciousness of the value of speech is achieved little by little, piece by piece. Sinhá Vitoria realizes that ''se ficasse calada, seria como um pé de mandacaru, secando, morrendo."20 (P. 126) Sinhá Vitória starts to talk to Fabiano, who in the beginning is reluctant, as usual, but he "acha bom que Sinhá Vitória tivesse puxado conversa,"21 (P. 127) and they talk and talk, realizing that they have changed, that it was worthless to try to remain in that area of drought, and that they would get a different occupation elsewhere. After a pause and some indecision, "a conversa recomeçou. Agora Fabiano estava meio otimista"22 (p. 128). They go on talking, making plans for the future, for the education of the children who, according to Sinhá Vitória, would never become vaqueiros; they would adopt a completely different lifestyle. Little by little, the idea of a new life possesses their minds, and they are both optimistic in their talk and conclusions. They are so involved in their conversations and plans that Fabiano Nao sentia a espingarda, o saco, as pedras miúdas que lhe entravam nas alpergatas, o cheiro de carniças que empestavam o caminho. As palavras de Sinhá Vitória encantavam-no. Iriam para diante, alcançariam uma terra desconhecida.23 (P. 134) What a different attitude from the first chapter and from most of the novel! The characters talk to each other, and the nar- rator seems to have reencountered the liberating discourse. The narrative assumes, at this level, another dimension: the search is not only that of Fabiano and his family for the promised land, but also the narrator s search who, twice threatened by the social problems he faces and by his inability to bring about an efficient solution, begins his unending search for the true narrative, i.e., that narrative which will give him the right to fulfill his narrator's functions. Seen through this perspective, Vidas Secas is a response to a typical postmodernist problem: that of the author in search of his ideal text. Conversely, Vidas Secas reminds us of Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author. Fabiano - 78 -</page><page sequence="23">and his family will be, in this view, only the instruments of an experience which is realized at the creative level: the creator becomes the real addresser and the subject, the mediate instrument of the searching process, in an adventure which aims to uncover speech mysteries. The narrator in Vidas Secas , contrary to some modernist tendencies, searches to reconstruct a fragmented narrative discourse. He attempts to penetrate the world of meanings and find out what there is behind the words. The adventure of Vidas Secas is the ad- venture of the author himself in search of the right text, of the right discourse. Only through the author's discovery and con- quest of the desired object do the characters achieve liberation and humanization. Characters, narrator and author live the same struggle. The actant model seems to be twofold, as illustrated in the figure below. Its organization is centered around the addresser, since the subject no longer imposes himself as a starting point. A. subject opponent the hero ignorance (social victim) y Y' addresser I, respons- ible for the process of awareness object ^ assistant the li- insufficient berative ▼ signs speech addressee the oppres- sed one - 79 -</page><page sequence="24">B. subject opponent character verbal (instru- opacity ment) y 4 addresser I, the writer object ^ ^ assistant the appro- misleading priate ▼ signs discourse addressee I, writer Greimas' model helps us to conclude that the question of who speaks, who thinks and to whom the narrated world belongs may be answered in accordance with the above figure. The narrative of Vidas Secas , in a sort of social compromise, is centered around an "I" who is anguished to find a form of expression (in the level of characters, readers, and /or an implied author) which provides him with the means to affirm himself, and an "I" (the writer) who strives for the appropriate means (appropriate discourse) for his act of naming the various ficticious phenomena and liberating the characters of his narrative.
