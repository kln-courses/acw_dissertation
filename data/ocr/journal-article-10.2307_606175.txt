It is not clear here why ( .a) and (2.a) should be caused by (1.1) and (2), respectively, the more because statement no. (1), which implies (1.1), should be understood as "logical proposition" ("logische Aussage") but not as "ontological proposition," ac- cording to Iwata, whereas the causal relation indicated by "&gt;" can only be understood on an ontological level. Moreover, ac- cording to Iwata's previous explanations, (l.a) and (2.a) are his own reformulations of the statements (1.1) and (2) respectively, where he substitutes the words "wahrgenommen werden" ("be- ing perceived") for "vorhanden sein" ("being present"). Thus the reader now either may relinquish his hope of understanding the formula or may assume that the symbol "=" here is not used in the meaning of "(l.a) is caused by (1.1)," etc., but somehow refers to the substitution. In fact, such a definition of "=" is found on the following page.3 After having successfully solved this problem, one now would expect that the supposition verbalized in the first part of this sentence should be identical with that of the formula in brackets in the second part, as the latter is introduced by "d.h." ("das heiBt"), which means "that is" or "that means." What should be deduced from the state- ments (1) and (2) is the sahopalambhaniyama. What in fact is deduced in the formula, namely (l.a) = [8.2'] and (2.a) = [8.1'], is only that the factor to be grasped is not perceived when the cognition is not perceived and that the cognition is not per- ceived when the factor to be grasped is not perceived, i.e., sahanupalambhaniyama. And this is, according to Iwata, a pre- supposition for the sahopalambhaniyama. Thus, Iwata's ideas could be understood more easily had he abstained from using this kind of formula. 3 Vol. I, p. 24: . . .

In spite of these shortcomings, Iwata's work is a valuable contribution to the understanding of Dharmakirti's theory of knowledge and the Buddhist epistemological tradition and a must for everybody interested in this field. HELMUT KRASSER AUSTRIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES Tibetan Medical Paintings: Illustrations to the Blue Beryl Treatise of Sangye Gyamtso (1653-1705). Translations and summaries by YURI PARFIONOVITCH; edited and introduced by Gyurme Dorje and Fernand Meyer, with editorial and linguistic consultations by Vilena Dylykova-Parfionovitch, Donatus Butkus, Robert Mayer, Sergey Klokov, and Helena Bespalova; general editor: ANTHONY ARIS; foreword by His Holiness, DALAI LAMA XIV. New York: HARRY N. ABRAMS, 1992. Appendix, bibliography, notes, index. Two volumes, slipcased. Pp. 340. $195. The first volume of this two-volume publication includes a foreword, preface, introductions, and the seventy-six color and one black-and-white medical paintings, with relevant translations and data opposite each painting, from the Blue Beryl treatise. The original paintings used in this publication were made under the auspices of the thirteenth Dalai Lama in the 1920s and are now held in the Ethnographic Museum in Ulan-Ude. The history of the compilation of the paintings used for this collection is detailed in the introduction (1:8). They are primarily reproductions of the original medical paintings commissioned in Lhasa from 1687-1703. The Blue Beryl treatise was completed in 1688 by Sangye Gyamtso (1653-1705), the regent of Tibet. It is a commentary on a much older noncanonical Tibetan treatise called the Four Tantras. The sequence of the paintings follows the four-part sequence of these two literary works. The first section of the texts and their corresponding paintings are called "... the Root Tantra, [which] presents the basics of medical science- physiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment, in the form of a concise arboreal metaphor." The second, third, and fourth sections of the texts and paintings are, respectively, the "Exe- getical Tantra [which] elaborates on the theoretical con- tent . . . , the Instructional Tantra [which] focusses on the practical application of medical diagnosis and treatment, [and] ... the Subsequent Tantra presents the system of diag- nostics, and the administering of medications or therapeutic techniques .. ." (I:14). The first painting shows the Medicine Buddha in the Indo- Tibetan tradition, an acknowledgement of the Buddhist orienta- 651</page><page sequence="2">Journal of the American Oriental Society 114.4 (1994) tion of the entire system. The mythical and historical medical lineages are shown in the top panels of the first fifteen paintings. Paintings two through four summarize the Tibetan medical sys- tem of physiology, pathology, and diagnostics in arboreal sym- bols. The fifth painting details human embryology. The sixth through eleventh paintings contain diagrams of and symbols for human anatomy. Paintings twelve and thirteen show the Bud- dhist system of subtle channels (these are also shown in part in the tenth painting). The fourteenth and fifteenth paintings chart specific vulnerable points in the human body. Sixteen through eighteen present the details of Tibetan medical physiology and pathology, including the analysis of mental states and dreams, and painting nineteen shows gross human pathologies. Number twenty details occupational pathologies and therapies, and paint- ings twenty-one and twenty-two are concerned with dietetics and dietary therapies. Paintings twenty-three through thirty-one show Tibetan materia medica; thirty-two and thirty-three, medi- cal formulaires; and thirty-four, medical instruments. Paintings thirty-five and thirty-six are concerned with health maintenance, diagnostics, and therapies. Painting thirty-seven depicts the ideal qualities of a physician in this system. Thirty-eight and thirty- nine are further diagrams of medical therapies, including blood- letting, surgery, and moxibustion. The next fourteen paintings, forty through fifty-three, are a compendium of disease etiologies, pediatrics, gynecology, geriatrics, toxic substances, diseases caused by demonic possession, and their treatments. Paintings fifty-four through sixty-seven are concerned with further diag- nostic procedures, including urinalysis and pulse diagnosis. Numbers sixty-eight through seventy-four contain detailed de- scriptions of medical treatments. The seventy-fifth and seventy- sixth paintings are a summary of diagnostic theory, and the last painting, seventy-seven, is concerned with the transmission of medical knowledge from teachers to students. The second volume includes black-and-white reproductions of the seventy-seven medical paintings, in which each item in each painting is assigned a number or letter. On each page op- posite these reproductions, the pharmacopeia, medical instru- mentation, religious symbolism, and applications to physical and religious disorders and diseases depicted in the paintings in volume one are systematically translated or rendered by conventional Western terms, with original Tibetan words listed in parentheses. The inscriptions from the Blue Beryl at the bottom of each painting are translated at the end of each list. The lineages of scholars, doctors, and saints depicted in the first fifteen paintings are identified. Volume two includes glossaries of Tibetan, Latin, and English medical terminology, and a bibliography. This project builds on the foundation of the text research, fieldwork, and Russian translations of Yuri Parfionovitch (1921- 1990). It is a welcome improvement over the 1983 and 1986 Ti- betan and Chinese editions and the 1988 edition with marginal English translations. The editors and authors present theoretical, historical, ethnographic, and religious data. Tibetan Medical Paintings is a unique publication because the volumes present Tibetan medical and Buddhist cultures in two media, verbal and visual. The seventeenth-century Tibetan medical system was de- veloped under diverse influences-Greek, Indian, Chinese, Iranian, and Tibetan regional variations (1:3). The specifics of these influences remain to be analyzed in detail. In addition to the inclusion of foreign medical technologies, there was his- torical development in the theory and practice of medicine in Tibet, lack of standardization of terminology, variations of availability and applications of medicines and techniques, different degrees of education, and most relevant, varying degrees of access to the paintings and texts presented in this publication. This development continues today as Tibetan medicine becomes secularized and changes in light of Western influences. Tibetan Medical Paintings is an accurate compen- dium of Tibetan medicine in theory and practice, and, at the same time, a valuable record of cultural and religious history. These books record the unique Tibetan synthesis of human physiology and the Buddhist conception of human life in its fully developed form. They are concerned with medicine both for the human body and the mind, in the Western conceptions, and with medical applications for the intricate subtle human anatomy, in the Buddhist conception. This subtle anatomy is similar to that found in Buddhist tantric literature, and is briefly explained as such in the introductory essays (I: 14). The presuppositions of Buddhist medicine state that human physi- ology consists of a substratum of ten physical tissues, fluids, and residues, and three "humoral" substances. The humors- "respiratory breath, bile stored in the gall bladder, and mucous secretions of the stomach"-are subtle, but they are real "substances," not simply "energies." These "humors," blood, and other physical "... fluids circulate through networks of different kinds of channels" (1:4). This theory clearly operates in contexts unavailable to everyday consciousness, in visible and invisible physiologies. Buddhist spiritual physiology is merged with classical Tibetan medical physiology. Painting thirty-seven describes the etiology of disease processes in psy- chological terms-human diseases are caused by "desire," "hatred," and "delusion." In this respect Tibetan Medical Paintings reveals a remarkable aspect of the Tibetan view of life, that the body and mind work together in a single interac- tive process. This publication is a landmark in the study of Tibetan medi- cine and culture. It is a reference tool for scholars of medicine and of Tibetan culture and religion, and of interest and easily accessible to those interested in Tibetan culture. Though lin- guistic hurdles were some of the "immense problems" (I:1) met in the preparation of this work, they were adequately over- come. These volumes can be the basis for further research on the connection between medical science and Tibetan Bud- 652</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books dhism, on modern applications of the Tibetan medical theory and practice, and on Tibetan culture and religion. Finally, they also provide the basic data for the development of a clinical reference tool. The shortcoming of incomplete text-critical analysis of the entire text is far outweighed by the huge amount of data in the translations, precise presentation of the data in the Blue Beryl, and introductory essays. The English transla- tions in the text are clear and understandable, and convey the meaning of the Tibetan. This project also lays a solid founda- tion for further research in diagnostic methodologies, prepara- tion of medicines, and comparative analysis of medical theory and ethics.2 The bibliography and annotated scholarly analyses provide ample resources for further investigation. Any short- comings of this effort are insignificant in relation to the benefits of this pioneering work in the field of Tibetan medicine. PAUL NIETUPSKI JOHN CARROLL UNIVERSITY 1 Cf. K.

Meditation Differently: Phenomenological-psychological As- pects of Tibetan Buddhist (Mahamudra and sNying-thig) Practices from Original Tibetan Sources. By HERBERT GUENTHER. Delhi: MOTILAL BANARSIDASS, 1992. Pp. xvi + 210. Rs 135. This book contains seven chapters, and half is devoted to the seventh: the translation of a work with the abbreviated title, "The Sun's Life-Giving Force," composed by rTse-le rGod- tshangs-pa sNa-tshogs-rang-grol (sixteenth century). The Ti- betan title is not provided. The first six chapters are the trans- lator's introduction. The author, rGod-tshangs-pa, attempts to reconcile two systems of praxis, the Mahamudra and the rDzogs-chen, associated primarily with two schools: the bKa'- brgyud and the rNying-ma. He expounds them in the traditional framework of "ground, path, and goal." His emphasis upon the middle term justifies "meditation" in the book title, although the philosophic underpinnings are kept visible throughout. The translator's qualifier "differently" must be intended to denigrate other, unmentioned schools; and the grammar of the "medita- tion differently" demonstrates his inveterate creativity. A derivative purpose of the author, who belongs to the rNying-ma school, is to authenticate the rDzogs-chen system by demonstrating its consistency with Mahamudra, whose Indian provenance is not doubted. rDzogs-chen texts and their "tantra" sources were excluded from most editions of the Tibetan canon of translated scripture, and for good reason: even as rGod- tshangs-pa presents them, for example, they demonstrate a pre- occupation with cosmogonic beginnings that is not typical of Indian Buddhism. The translated text does indeed present the experience of meditation in unusual ways. Important topics include (p. 131) the role of inspection (dran pa, smrti)-whether it entangles the mind or facilitates liberation; the relationship of the two systems to supreme yoga-tantra (pp. 135ff.) and its psycho-physiology (138ff.); and the effects of the "lighting up" experience (p. 150) on behavior in the world-in a word, non-activity. Still farther along the path (pp. 153ff.), the bodhisattva's wisdom and pow- ers are presented from the point of view of the bodhisattva's mind, not-as in most other texts-by observation from out- side. Even the dreams of bodhisattvas are described. Because the rDzogs-chen has been studied less than the sys- tems of other schools, the value of bringing this text to light is all the greater. However, the dearth of alternative renderings makes it difficult to assess the translator's interpretations. The bibliography contains numerous Tibetan sources but no study or translation by any contemporary buddhist or buddhologist, aside from the translator himself. There is no question of Pro- fessor Guenther's high level of linguistic competence; the fol- lowing issues are raised in the spirit of inquiry. The term "Being," drawn from Heidegger, leaps out of the text. The translator has responded in previous works to the suggestion that it wrongly imputes to rDzogs-chen thought a quasi-substantialism. The term translates gzhi, more com- monly translated as "ground." In the text by rGod-tshangs-pa, gzhi is rendered initially as "basis" (p. 96), then as "Being" (pp. 97ff.). This "Being" (in parentheses, p. 97), is imputed with "overall purposing"-a development that seems to stretch past substantialism to anthropomorphism. A substantialist interpretation may be justified by this very work of rGod-tshangs-pa, who relates (and deflects) a Mahamudra criticism of rDzogs-chen as sub- stantialist for its treatment of gzhi (here translated as "ulti- mate stuff," p. 130). However, it seems doubtful that gzhi is as prominent in the rDzogs-chen system as it is in the translator's. In a passage of chapter three (p. 28) translated from the mKha'-yang of kLong-chen Rab-'byams-pa, the term "Being" appears six times (twice it is placed within parentheses) whereas it does not appear at all in the original Tibetan. This instance could be multiplied. In numerous places besides, abstract nouns are created where they do not appear to be warranted by the Tibetan text. Restricting our examination to the translation proper, the phrase ka dag pa (p. 101), generally understood to mean "pure 653</page></plain_text>
