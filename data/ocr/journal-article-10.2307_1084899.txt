<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews when put in this stream, adds an important element for the development of a comparative social history. A History of Children's Play is a book that deserves attention. The Classroom Society: The Construction of Educational Experience by Herbert A. Thelen. New York: Halsted Press, 1981. 226 pp. $27.95. Arthur Blumberg Syracuse University Let me start out very directly. At first glance, the casual reader of The Classroom Society may be inclined to toss it off as a warmed-over plea to mobilize education under the banner of a new "progressive" education, seeking to resuscitate "life adjustment" as what schools should be all about. To do so would be a rather gross error. Furthermore, the book cannot be read casually. It needs to be studied, thought about, and, if an anthropomorphism is permitted, argued with. Put another way, the book may be seen as an invitation to the reader to engage in an internal dialogue about the values, assumptions, and practices that historically have provided the basis of educational enterprise. The dialogue, though, is not only an intellectual one. Inescapably, for the serious reader, it will also involve the emotions, as Thelen forces us to compare what we do in the name of education with what we might do. He rattles the skeletons in one of our back closets, and, for most of us -university professors or public school teachers-this can be a somewhat disconcerting experience. Can Thelen really be writing about me? If I am honest, the answer is yes. But like anyone who is reading this review, I have learned well how to rationalize my behavior as I see it conflicting with some of my values. Nonetheless, the book should not be read if one is unwilling to engage in such a dialogue. So much for my own preface to The Classroom Society. The Classroom Society is more than a book about classrooms and teachers. It is, perhaps, equally a book about Herbert Thelen. It speaks not only of the delicate and complex issues of educating children, making policies about their education, about curriculum and evaluation, ARTHUR BLUMBERG is professor of education in the School of Ed- ucation, Syracuse University. He did his undergraduate work at the University of Connecticut and his graduate work at Springfield College and Columbia University. His research and writing concerns are with the group and organizational factors that relate to learning and work life in the schools.

It also speaks of Thelen's intellectual and emotional history as a rigorous thinker and a compassionate human being who has, over the last 40 years, maintained his own personal quest for ways to think about a theory and a practice of education. Such an education would conceive it not as an "information-oriented acquisition of knowledge" but "as a process of individual 'unfolding' and self-realization, through which, either directly or indirectly, a better (i.e., more educative) society will come into being" (p. 66). The intellectual and emotional history that Thelen brings to bear in this book seems to derive from two sources. First, there was his early experience as a graduate student in chemistry and then as a high school science teacher who took part in the evaluation phase of the Eight-Year Study (Aiken 1942). Second was his involvement as a professor of education at The University of Chicago with the National Training Laboratories and T-group training. It is this latter experience that pervades the book, though in a subtle way. However, it is not the emotional-expressive, "let it all hang out" part of the T-group myth that Thelen uses in his analysis. Rather, his interest in and study of the group as a learning environment leads to his understanding of the classroom as a microsociety. Furthermore, it leads to his position that the educative classroom, one that fosters the process of individual unfolding and self-realization, mandates that the teacher comprehend the dynamics of the classroom as a group and not as an aggregate of individuals who are gathered in compulsory fashion to learn infor- mation. Thus, we have references to Bion's (1961) notions of group emotionality and of the relationship between such emotionality and the task of the group. And in a related fashion, Thelen's own work reported in Emotional Dynamics and Group Culture (Stock and Thelen 1958) comes into play. As another example, one that is central to the methodological theory Thelen proposes, we find continual emphasis placed on Helen Hall Jennings's (1950) ideas of psyche groups and sociogroups and the manner in which the task of the classroom group is facilitated or hampered by a less than adequate understanding and use of this underworld of interacting group dynamics. The Classroom Society is about change in the schools and changing the way we conceive schools. It is introduced by the metaphorical title of chapter 1, "The Cultural Archetype: Education's Guardian Angel." (A foreshadowing of this title is found, I think, in Thelen's article, "Some Classroom Quiddities for People-oriented Teachers" [1965]. He wrote at that time of the sacred and sacrosanct beliefs that maintain our thinking about education.) The guardian angel, in this case, however, 378 American Journal of Education</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews is more malevolent than benign, at least as Thelen sees it. That is, what has developed in our society is a widespread and rather firmly implanted notion of not only what schools ought to be doing but how they ought to be doing it. And, of course, the what and how of the schools, according to the archetype, is a focus on information acquisition and technical competence, not "dialectical quests for meaning" (p. 11), which, from Thelen's view, is what a humane, fulfilling education should be all about. This archetype not only is present in the adult community but among students as well, and it constitutes the major barrier to change of the type that Thelen advocates. Everyone has been to school. Everyone knows what should happen in schools. The cultural archetype results from these facts to reinforce what has been. Who meddles with the sacred, after all? But if we are to move from where we are to where Thelen would have us be, some meddling, perhaps major meddling, must take place. The cultural archetype lurks in the background of the rest of the book. It is present as Thelen discusses policymaking for an educative school, the dialogue and dialectics necessary for educational change, what the educative goal of growth means, the need for trade-offs in values, the classroom as a group, the role of the teacher, teaching, curriculum building, and evaluation or, as he entitles his last chapter, "The Enterprise Comes to Judgment." It is all highly yeasty and meaty, to mix a metaphor. In fact, from the perspective of a rather brief review such as this is, there is much too much contained in the book for justice to be done. Hardly a page goes by that does not leave the reader with something about which to conduct an internal dialogue- which I think is what Thelen meant to have happen. For me, though, because I see myself primarily as a teacher, the book's major impact appeared in chapters 7, 8, and 9-"Propositions for Educative Class- rooms," "The Role of the Teacher," and Teaching: Development of the Enquiring Community." In what follows, I note just a few central thoughts that attracted my attention with some force. In chapter 7, we confront, in some detail, an analysis of the classroom society according to Thelen. It consists of the interpersonal network (the psyche group), the legislative network (the sociogroup), and the task group, wherein the student becomes the "doer, problem-solver, creator, producer, investigator" (p. 110). The essential task of teaching is to develop and maintain a fluid and creative mix of student activity related to classroom needs by making appropriate use of these three groups whose membership may be transient, depending on what it is to be worked on. Crucial to the analysis is this last point, as Thelen differentiates work-an effort that makes a difference-from labor- August 1982 379</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews an effort that "may make a difference but not in its own right and not to the laborer" (p. 112). I was left thinking about how much of what my students engage in is work and how much is labor. Chapter 8 speaks of the role of the teacher as being one that has its conceptual base as a group analyst, diagnostician, and interpreter of behavior. Only as the teacher has these skills can the teacher's insights and creative abilities concerning task-work productivity-be brought to bear effectively. Again, the key word is work, as the focus of the teacher's role is to develop a classroom society in which the members voluntarily engage in work, which they find attractive, not labor, which is repelling. The title of chapter 9, "Teaching: Development of Enquiring Com- munity," reminded me of Schaefer's (1967) little book, The School as a Center of Inquiry. In the latter, what is proposed is the concept of a school in which a central concern is the production of knowledge about teaching and learning, as well as the concern with instruction itself. In a very real way, these are the focuses of the classroom as an enquiring community, as Thelen sees them. What a tantalizing prospect it would be to link the two ideas together! Central to chapter 9, and to me as a teacher, is the model that Thelen proposes that would enable students to reorganize and reconstruct experience (a Deweyan notion)-in short, to engage in educative, work-oriented activity. The model suggests how teachers, based on their understanding of the classroom group's behavior and task at any single moment, can make choices about what types of individual or group activities need to be engaged in to help further the student's quest. (It is essential that teachers assume that students are engaged in some sort of quest, says Thelen.) Use of the model mandates, among many other things, that the teacher be free enough with himself or herself to give up direct surveillance of students as they move from working alone to working in groups to back working by themselves to working with the total class. Taskmasters or prison guards need to maintain surveillance as the people under them are engaged in labor. The enquiring classroom is engaged in the human quest for work, thus obviating the need for surveillance. Because work is a natural, sought-for human activity, the teacher of the enquiring classroom also becomes free to work, not labor. Or so goes the implicit conceptual underpinning of this book. What is to be made of it all? Obviously, Thelen speaks my language. Equally obvious are my highly positive reactions to the book. I am left, though, with questions-about myself as a person and as a teacher. To what extent, for example, by my behavior with students in the classroom or in my office, do I reinforce the cultural archetype? I am also left with the question of whether The Classroom Society makes 380 American Journal of Education</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews demands on teachers that they cannot fulfill, that are unrealistic in all but a relatively few classroom settings. But then, is this only a ration- alization in the face of a task that Thelen would have us undertake? Readers of the book, as always, must supply their own answers. Not to read this book will deprive a person of the opportunity to engage in a good argument. References Aiken, Wilford M. Story of the Eight-Year Study. New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1942.
