<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT IS THEOLOGY?I (A Reply to Professor H. D. Lewis) JOHN HARTLAND-SWANN, B.Litt., Ph.D. PROFESSOR LEWIS'S paper, which appeared in a recent issue of this journal, raised many interesting problems. I propose, however, to deal only with the principal question which Mr. Lewis himself stated as follows: Just what is theology, what does it do ? Mr. Lewis's own answer as to what it does-or rather what it should do to-day- an answer which came rightly enough at the end of his paper, was, briefly, that theology should become creative as opposed to static. That is to say, it should, on the analogy of art criticism, " 'render' the religious experiences of the past by performing upon them as a whole, and with all the help which careful scholarship can provide, an operation not dissimilar to that performed in the complete symbolism of the original experience upon the elements of more overt meaning within it." Now, I must confess right away that I am not at all clear what this really implies; but if it does imply what I think it implies, then I believe we may have to wait a considerable time before Mr. Lewis's "reapers" appear. In order to make my point clear, I propose to offer my own version of what theologians have conceived their job to be, and also to say something about the grave difficulties with which they are faced but which they are often prone to ignore. I should like to approach this question by discussing first of all the nature of religion. Now, it is apparently one of the most difficult things in the world to find a satisfactory definition of religion (the same of course applies to a definition of philosophy, as Mr. Lewis has well pointed out). The psychologist Leuba collected no less than forty-eight definitions, added two more of his own-and rejected the lot. The reason for this was not that any of the definitions was necessarily incorrect, but that all were partial. Each writer in question emphasized as religious that aspect of life which was for him significant. We must conclude, therefore, that if we are in search of adequacy as well as exactness, the term religion does not admit of any short or simple definition: its various aspects must be dealt with separately, although at the same time their interconnection must be made clear. This prompts me to hazard a definition of my own. Religion, then, I will say, has three main aspects and any fruitful definition must take account of all three and distinguish between them. If it does not do so, then only confusion can result. These I This paper was read before the Oxford University Socratic Club on May I9, I952, in reply to Prof. Lewis's paper of the same title. 54</page><page sequence="2">WHAT IS THEOLOGY? three aspects may be defined-with the maximum of generality and the minimum of complexity-as follows: (A) A certain emotional attitude, adopted on suitable occasions, individually or in groups. (B) Certain customs, ritual and institutions. (C) A system of beliefs implicative of a special relationship between man and something "beyond" himself. These beliefs may be expressed in the form of propositions con- cerning certain ultimate facts of a metaphysical nature. This defining schema, obviously enough, does little more than describe the three main characteristics of any religion which is susceptible of coherent formulation and exposition. It says nothing of the particular human emotion or emotions involved, nothing of the precise rituals employed, or institutions that flourish, in any particular cult, and nothing of the actual beliefs or the allegedly ultimate facts presupposed. All this can be extracted from relevant works on psychology, sociology, anthropology and comparative religion. What we require, in the present context, is merely a stable basis on which to work, so that we may elucidate the religious "complex," as we might call it, from a universal point of view and study its point of contact with both theology and philosophy-a matter to which Mr. Lewis referred in the early part of his paper. The distinction between the three aspects of religion is of course logical rather than actual; but aspects (A) and (B)-the emotional attitude and the ritual respectively-existed in primitive, loosely organized cults without aspect (C). Or, to put it more accurately, they existed without (C) in its form of explicit highly systematized dog- matic formulations such as we find in medieval scholasticism. Now, although theology pays some attention to the emotional attitude, as well as to ritual and institutions, its main concern is with (C)- that is, with beliefs. In short, it is the peculiar task of the theologian to codify, to systematize, and, so far as possible, to rationalize the complex body of beliefs forming the accepted basis of the particular religion in which he is interested. This was precisely what Hesiod, an early theologian, tried to do, a little crudely perhaps, in his Theogony-just as it was what the far more sophisticated medieval theologians attempted in their mighty Summae. But, unlike Hesiod, the scholastic theologians were pre-eminently concerned with explicit dogma. They would therefore have agreed with the following state- ment of the atheistical philosopher McTaggart: "I maintain that dogma is necessary to religion. Dogma is not religion, any more than the skeleton is the living body. But we can no more be religious with- out dogma than our bodies could live without their skeletons." McTaggart did not concern himself overmuch with how dogma 55</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY comes to enter the religious scheme in the first place; but if we address ourselves to certain psychologists we are given an interesting his- torical explanation. This explanation may be summed up by saying that dogma first arose from early and more or less inchoate attempts to formulate, or intellectualize, certain primitive "behaviour- compulsions." To elaborate slightly: certain human behaviour- compulsions are exhibited in early religious customs, ritual and institutions-which vary according to climate, locality and race- and as a counterpart to these, myths grow up, at first verbal, then written; and finally from these myths are developed the often very abstract dogmas about whose validity theologians spend their lives arguing with each other. And it is to be noted, our psychologists insist, that religious dogma, once extracted from behaviour-com- pulsions and rationalized, goes forward under its own steam so to speak, and expands into a vast intellectualist structure which bears little relation to the original behaviour-compulsions responsible for its genesis. Of course, theologians do not, as a rule, pay much attention to this sort of explanation; for them, dogma is based on revelation as mediated by "authority." But to this our psychologists would reply that dogma, though originally deriving from the intel- lectualization of behaviour-compulsions, is now attributed to divine revelation through an all-too-human process of interpolation and subreption; and they would add that this so-called supernatural revelation inversely serves to justify to believers the customs, ritual and institutions of the particular cultus they have adopted and practise. This acute conflict of opinion over the status and validity of revelation raises, obviously enough, a most important problem, to which I shall return in a moment. But I want first to complete my elucidation of the religious complex by saying something about how philosophy fits in. We might put it this way. The propositional aspect of religion (aspect (C) in my defining schema) is not only the main concern of theology-it is also, to a limited extent, the province of philosophy. That is to say, philosophy, if (and it is a big if!) its theory of knowledge permits, can deal with certain fundamental problems concerning the existence of a supreme Being, the nature of soul or spirit and other contiguous matters. Many philosophers have considered, and some perhaps still consider, that it is the peculiar duty of philosophy to act as a sort of purifier of extravagant and anthropomorphic religious beliefs. The position was put by Pringle- Pattison as follows: "It is the proper office of philosophy, or let us say of the critical reason generally, to purify religious belief and practice by teaching man to discard intellectually untenable or morally unworthy conceptions of the divine." That philosophy has an important role to play in regard to religious belief has in fact been 56</page><page sequence="4">WHAT IS THEOLOGY? affirmed by a great number of philosophers from Plato down to McTaggart; but the negative function outlined by Pringle-Pattison has usually been combined with a complementary positive function. Thus, it has been held that a rational approach to certain ultimate problems-common to philosophy and theology-enables some basic religious beliefs to be metaphysically validated. And this leads to the formulation of that philosophical or "natural" theology which goes back to Plato's Laws and received such detailed treatment during the Middle Ages. Even the sceptical Hume declared-how consis- tently with his main philosophical position we need not enquire- that there were rational grounds for a somewhat attenuated theism. Let us, however, concentrate for a moment on the Middle Ages. By the time St. Thomas Aquinas came on the scene, the position was briefly as follows. It was held that there were two domains of truth, called Faith and Reason respectively. The domain of Faith embraced those religious truths disclosed by an authoritative interpretation of Holy Writ; the domain of Reason covered those truths which, with the help of Aristotle's philosophy, could be established by the lumen naturale alone. These two domains overlapped; and the area common to both contained, therefore, those truths of Faith that could be franked by Reason-it contained, that is, the body of truth known as natural theology. But-and this I think is important-it was also held that the residual truths of Faith, though not rationally demon- strable, were not on that account to be regarded as "contrary" to Reason, but rather as "above" Reason. This was the position as Albertus Magnus understood it, and his disciple Aquinas busied himself with determining the exact size the area of natural theology was to be. And it was this tactic which enabled him to achieve his famous synthesis of philosophy and theology and thus to erect what he hoped would be a permanent and stable bridge between Faith and Reason. The Thomist synthesis illustrates, I think, the desire, common to so many theologians, to enjoy the best of two worlds-the world of doctrinal orthodoxy and the world of rational speculation-and to satisfy, if they can, both the intellect and emotions of mankind. That this policy has its dangers, however, was recognized by Aquinas' immediate scholastic successors, Duns Scotus and William of Occam. Realizing that Reason is sometimes apt to show scant respect for theological dogmas, they began to withdraw more and more religious truths from the scope of rational explanation. In this, Occam went much further than Scotus; for he held that, in order to protect Faith against sceptical attack, all religious truths, including even the existence of God, should be withdrawn from the sphere of Reason and find their justification in revelation as mediated by authority. As a consequence, the bridge between Faith and Reason, 57</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY so painstakingly erected by Albertus and Aquinas, was now declared to be unstable and indeed unusable. Natural theology was thus eliminated, and revelation was all. The point of my dwelling on the medieval situation is that it is reflected in modern theology. To-day, there are some theologians who believe, as Aquinas believed, that some religious truths at least can be rationally demonstrated; and there are other theologians who believe, as Occam believed, that it is safer to keep religious truths well out of the way of rational enquiry. And there are also, it may be noted, some theologians who look back, not only to Occam but even to Tertullian; for they appear to hold, not only that no religious truth is capable of rational demonstration, but that it is precisely by being absurd and irrational that a religious dogma becomes worthy of credence. I think that some of the continental theologians-so ably castigated in Professor Lewis's book Morals and the New Theology-would fall into this category. Not many modern theologians, then, are convinced that philosophy can do very much for them. And those that are, since they are relying for support on a discipline distinct from their own, would do well to examine what professional philosophers, without theological com- mitments, have to say. In point of fact, most moder philosophers would either agree with William of Occam that no theological truth can be philosophically validated, or, if they happen to be positivists, declare outright that all theological propositions, being metaphysical, are philosophically meaningless. Moreover, even if philosophy is still in some way relevant to religious belief (as I myself believe it is), it is by no means certain that it can furnish the sort of proofs theologians require, or indeed any proofs at all. Hence, however much some theologians may hanker after philosophical support, the only tenable sanction for the dogmas peculiar to any faith appears to be revela- tion-or, more precisely, certain sacred texts which are held to be divinely inspired and therefore true. Such a sanction has always been declared necessary for the more specifically "dogmatic" claims of a particular faith-claims for long regarded as "beyond" or "above" reason; but it seems now that revelation may also have to bear the full weight of the basic claims concerning God and the human soul which in the past were also sustained by philosophical argument. The validity of revelation, therefore, constitutes the central problem to-day, not only for the would-be religious believer, but also for Mr. Lewis's creative theologian. It will be noted that I have already raised, by implication, a momentous question which Christian theologians are apt to by-pass, or dismiss all too easily, in their efforts to unravel the implications of their own sacred texts. This question can be stated quite simply. Are we justified in regarding the Christian revelation as true, and 58</page><page sequence="6">WHAT IS THEOLOGY? Mohammedan, Hindu and Buddhist revelations as false? Or, sup- posing we are of the Moslem world, must we regard the Koran as divinely inspired and the New Testament (as interpreted by Christian theologians) as embodying a mass of fictitious claims? The fact that the Christian and Mohammedan revelations are not entirely mutually exclusive (since they both proclaim a single personal God) does not alter the fundamental problem; for the Christian cannot find any warrant in his Scriptures for the sacred truths enunciated in the Koran, and the Mohammedan must declare Christ's alleged claim to divinity to be wholly spurious. In short, the dogmatic claims peculiar to Christianity are clearly opposed to those peculiar to Moham- medanism-and equally to those peculiar to any of the other world-religions. In the light of these competing revelations, then, what is the per- plexed seeker after religious truth to believe? There are, I think, three possible alternatives. (I) He may regard all so-called revelations as mere codifications of human wish-fulfilments-this is, broadly speaking, the psychological-anthropological approach. (2) He may regard competing revelations as all containing some truth, and attribute the differences to some divine influence adapting the revelation to the varying intellectual and emotional requirements of different races or geographical groups. This view has something in common with the praeparatio evangelica theory about so-called pagan cults, but more exactly it represents the position of Professor Rhadakrishnan. (3) He may regard one revelation only as true, and declare all others to be false. Now the uncomfortable fact which the open-minded student has to face is that for each one of these alternative policies there is as much, or as little, justification as for the other two. Of course, those who have already convinced themselves of the truth of one or the other will naturally build up as strong a case as they can for their own particular view. The arguments that can be adduced for the first alternative are certainly persuasive-as students of psychology, anthropology and comparative religion are well aware. Anthropo- logists, for example, have discovered that Christian beliefs and practices are paralleled in a thousand tribal religions-a discovery that not only undermines the claim to exclusiveness of Christian dogmas, but also, taken with other discoveries, indicates that man's religious beliefs are basically conditioned by his psychological needs. Nevertheless, it is at least possible to maintain that even if sacred texts are in some sense an expression of man's emotional require- ments, they may also be the vehicle for some divine message. Yet of this there can be neither proof nor disproof-which means that the vital point at issue is undecided and undecidable. The second alter- native, though representing a more liberal view than the third, 59</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY likewise evades this point-for none of its adherents can tell us how we are to know that so-called sacred texts are in any way different from mere mythology which is admitted to be the product of human imagination. For the third alternative there is no proper argument available at all-the Christian, the Mohammedan and the Hindu can equally claim sole validity for their respective revelations, and though one can question the validity of revelation in general (as those who adopt the first alternative necessarily do), I do not see by what possible criterion you can declare one revelation to be more credence- worthy than another. If there is such a criterion, it can, I believe, be only that of the individual's own religious experience. But since religious experience constitutes a problem on its own-as I shall endeavour to show in a moment-I feel impelled to suggest that this question of competing revelations is one to which there is no proper solution. It may be that all revelation is mere mythology or mumbo- jumbo; it may be that there is some genuinely divine message en- shrined in all (or most) revelations; or it may be that one revelation is wholly true and all the rest false. No one, therefore, can reasonably blame a Mohammedan for not being a Christian, or a Christian for refusing to embrace the dogmas of Mahayana Buddhism; either may be right and both may be mistaken. With the ground thus cleared, I should now like to consider a problem which more specifically concerns most of us in the West, namely, the status and validity of the Christian revelation. For whether or no Christianity is, in the final analysis, more credence- worthy than other faiths, it certainly has a prior claim on our consideration since it is an integral part of our cultural tradition. Now whatever concessions to "common sense" a Christian theolo- gian may be willing to make here and there, his standpoint must be that the Scriptures are, to put it shortly, the word of God. For that reason the alleged historical events they record are true; and for the same reason the doctrines which they teach, and the conduct which they enjoin, must be accepted and followed. Of course, most theo- logians would enter a pretty substantial caveat about the Old Testament, but they would stand by every word of the New. It is, they would claim, an authentic account of certain historical events, written by men directly inspired by God; and from the recorded sayings of Jesus, the Son of God, we learn the true basis of a universal religion. Unfortunately, however, it is on this very question of authenticity that the moder seeker after truth encounters the gravest difficulties. For if by "authenticity" is meant that each book of the New Testament was actually written, as it now stands, by the person who is alleged to have written it-then the New Testament, taken as a whole, is far from authentic. It is in fact, according to impartial Biblical scholars, a mass of interpolations, suppressions, 6o</page><page sequence="8">WHAT IS THEOLOGY? distortions and (in some cases) downright forgeries. We can under- stand, therefore, why those who claim to be inspired by the scientific outlook are prone to view the New Testament with a certain amount of suspicion. But even those who consider the scientific outlook irrelevant in this context may well ask themselves whether the Almighty could really have decided to convey his divine message in such a dubious way. Many of course have asked themselves this question, and not feeling able to provide a satisfactory answer have abandoned the dogmas of Christianity while still accepting that Jesus of Nazareth formulated the finest ethical code that the mind of man could conceive. There is nothing, however, that distresses a theologian more than to have Christianity reduced to a mere code of ethics. Moreover, it is still open to him to reply that, granting the Biblical scholars are right about the textual manipulations, the actual message is still authentic, and the various doctrines which have been based on the reported life and sayings of Jesus form the one, true, universal religion. Such a claim, however-which in certain circumstances might have much to recommend it-raises serious problems, which I propose briefly to consider. Now if we ask what it was that first split Christendom in two, and subsequently split the Protestant portion into multiple fragments, the broad answer must be: the vital question of the correct interpre- tation of Holy Writ. Hence, if a theologian tells us to-day that the actual message of the gospels is still authentic, we have at once to ask him: what exactly is this message? But here is the rub. For his answer will vary according to his own particular faith. If he is a Roman Catholic he will give us an answer which clashes with what he would have given us had he been a Protestant. Moreover, although every Catholic theologian would, broadly speaking, give us the same answer, the answers we should receive from Protestant theologians would differ quite fundamentally. Consider, for instance, the present conflict of opinion on the dogma of the Virgin Birth-sharply aired at a recent Modem Churchmen's conference at Cambridge; or the denial by some theologians, and the acceptance by others, of Biblical miracles in general. It is indeed a far cry to-day from Canterbury to Birmingham. All this indicates how difficult it is, for the Protestant Church at least, to come forward with one authentic message and one only, in the light of Biblical scholarship. And if we interrogated theologians or leaders of other Protestant sects (Methodists, Presbyterians, Quakers and so forth), we should be impelled towards the conclusion that there are as many "authentic messages" as there are divisions in the Church. The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, it is true, appears to embody a uniform message, but even here, as we saw not so long ago, this message is liable to be altered at the behest of the Pope. This new variation of 6I</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY the Scriptural message-I refer to the bodily Assumption of the Holy Mother into Heaven-will doubtless be accepted by all Roman Catholics with good grace; but it appears to have caused considerable misgiving among Protestants, and has been rejected outright by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York on the ground that there is no warrant whatever for it in the Scriptures. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the Eastern Churches (Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox and so forth) have steadfastly refused, since the year A.D. 787, to accept any of Rome's pronouncements regarding new dogmas. It is clear enough, then, that there is no single "authoritative" Christian message which can be proffered for our acceptance or rejection. What we believe, therefore, if we are of the Christian faith, is purely a matter of personal preference-that is, if we are relying exclusively on revelation. Moreover, even if we are determined to discount traditional interpretations, and to make a searching analysis of Holy Writ for ourselves, we are in no better case. For impartial Biblical scholarship-to which we have inevitably to turn for our basic information-discloses that there is no means of knowing which of the various messages has the better claim to divine inspira- tion or to be "authentic." Some scholars (M. Alfred Loisy for instance) even go so far as to say that we cannot be certain that we possess one genuine saying of Jesus. This question of the "authentic message" then, is the question, the nagging, ineluctable question, which faces the would-be pious believer and equally the new, creative theologian of Mr. Lewis. It is the question that incontinently thrust itself forward when Mr. Lewis said that it was important for us "to hasten the revival of true religion," or when he spoke of the creative theologian "forging new truths" and performing upon "those deposits of truth which have settled more permanently in our religious traditions." In other words, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that these remarks of Mr. Lewis conceal a vast petitio principii; for how are we to recognize a "true" religion when we see it-what is our touchstone to be? Mr. Lewis does not say. He does not tell us how we are to distinguish between genuine religion on the one hand, and mere superstition on the other. Many dogmas of Roman Catholic theology are regarded as downright superstition by Protestant theology-and vice versa; while what is superstition to the Christian may be the embodiment of spiritual truth to the Mohammedan or Hindu. Yet it is possible that Mr. Lewis has got an answer to this problem, and that this answer centres in what is called religious experience. For religious experience, Mr. Lewis insisted, is to play a large part in determining the activity or orientation of the modern creative theologian. This may well be important. It is true of course-as sceptics would be 62</page><page sequence="10">WHAT IS THEOLOGY? quick to remind us-that much so-called religious experience can be explained away by psychological analysis. It derives, we may be told, from a sort of internal wish-fulfilment under pressure from emotional requirements. But it may not be legitimate to interpret all religious experience in this way-and certainly psychologists are incapable of proving that it all can be so interpreted. Thus it may be that many people are able to experience in a less "intense" way what the great mystics claim to experience ecstatically-namely, God. But not all people have the same sort of religious experience (some have none at all); and no doubt much already accepted belief is, almost unconsciously, merged into what is actually experienced. This would explain why a Christian who claims to experience God might also claim that he in some way experiences Jesus too-or why the Mohammedan might claim to experience, not some ineffable One (as the true mystic is supposed to do), but the benevolent yet jealous Creator-God whom the Koran has told him about. In general, I believe, the deliverances of religious experience are vague and imprecise-people somehow "feel" the presence of Deity or Spirit- but are then perhaps tempted to interpret this experience in terms of some clearly enunciated set of doctrines (usually those of their traditional faith). Yet to admit this vagueness and imprecision seems to me far more convincing than to claim that some exact knowledge is gained which buttresses the pretensions of one particular faith. Hence, while I can appreciate Mr. Lewis's contention that the modern creative theologian should "forge new truths" in the "fires of deep and continuous religious experiences," I am curious to know how these truths will appear when expressed in ordinary language. Will they resemble, or differ radically from, the dogmatic truths of traditional theologies? If they differ, is there a chance of eventual wide acceptance? Will a sufficiently large number of other, and more simple, people find that they correspond to their own religious experiences-assuming that they have some? Moreover, to quote Mr. Lewis's own words, "How can we know what is from God, and what is not, if God is so much beyond and 'other than' ourselves?" These, then, are some of the difficulties which I see facing any one who wishes to embark on theological reconstruction. As Mr. Lewis appositely remarked, it is the truth we are after and we cannot have two contradictory answers to the same question. Let me conclude, therefore, by summing up in a few words the threefold dilemma with which the creative theologian will have to cope. (I) If he uses reason or philosophy as a support for religious belief, he ignores the lessons of history-and courts a very rough handling from modern philoso- phers; on the other hand, he has got to meet the challenge of people who think like Professor Sir Edmund Whittaker. "The religious man," said Professor Whitaker in a reply to Fred Hoyle, "asserts that 63</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY religion cannot be accepted on any other ground than that it is true; it must be justified in the first instance at the bar of reason: the intellect must be satisfied first, the heart afterwards." (2) If our theologian elects to tread the Occamist path, and relies entirely on revelation, then he will be up against all the difficulties which I have discussed, and will find it virtually impossible to select an authentic message which will be universally agreed to be such. But if he cannot find an authentic message, then presumably revelation is useless. (3) If finally he falls back on his own religious experience, he may find this difficult to express in words, and even if expressible, by no means easy to reconcile with the conflicting religious experiences of others. Yet there cannot-as Mr. Lewis and I have agreed-be two contradictory answers to the same question. Where then, I ask Mr. Lewis, are his reapers to go for their harvest, and how are they to be sure that what they call wheat will not appear to others as tares?
