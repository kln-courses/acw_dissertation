<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Anxious Pursuit: Agricultural Innovation and Modernity in the Lower South, 1730-1815. By Joyce E. Chaplin. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1993. Pp. xvii, 411. $45.00 Joyce Chaplin's fascinating study of agricultural innovation in the Lower South and its relationship to modernity is a hallmark of its kind. It seeks successfully to cover the transition from colonial to antebellum South to see how a society that was earlier at the forefront of economic progress, particularly in its coastal-lowlands manifestations, could reach a stage of economic and social anachronism in the quarter-century before the Civil War. It cannot be said to have stagnated, except in some regions. Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, for example, believe that the southern economy was quite competitive. In the eyes of contemporary opponents, indeed, it was rapaciously expanding. Denizens of the most progressive (industrial) societies of the time neverthe- less regarded it largely with disrelish. Professor Chaplin makes it clear that transition or transformation was not what she sought. She began what she thought would be a "study of historical continuity but ... ended up emphasizing change as well as persistance" (p. vii). Her realization, after hours of perusing planters' library inventories "containing all the latest (circa 1800)</page><page sequence="2">466 Reviews of Books in improving literature," that Lower South society was by no means static might almost be considered commonplace, except that the contrary assumption forms the implicit lens through which much antebellum southern history has been written. It is a misleading presumption. The notion of progress was an important component of Lower South life. Although society was based on a system of enslaved labor about which many, even of its practitioners, had doubts, it had obvious economic viability and was the basis by the 1770s of the richest region in North America. In 1774, the Upper and Lower South together held one-half the total private wealth of colonial America. At the same date, nine people with the greatest inventoried wealth were South Carolinians. Moreover, societies in Georgia and Florida that had tried to operate free-labor economies had proven to be comparative failures. Yankees, among others, migrated South in the post-Revolutionary era, attracted by the evident prospects for prosperity. Bringing welcomed skills to the search for wealth, often pioneering technological change, they had no trouble adjustinig to slavery. Recognizing its drawbacks, they nevertheless embraced its promise. It remained for later generations to couple economic develop- ment with industrialization. One of the most interesting aspects of Chaplin's book is her analysis of southern social thought, based on an historical schema adduced by the Scottish school. (And any reading of Eugene Genovese, especially his early work, on the white South will need to be supplemented with Chaplin.) Scottish theory allowed Lower South planters to fashion a defense of slavery out of doctrines that would not seem obviously to favor it, for their doubts about slavery had the same source. This defense, she suggests, prefigured but was not the same as the antebellum stance. In particular, it was more forward- than backward-looking. Slavery might be a temporary expedient along .the route to commercial success but inhibited its highest development. Ultimately, it must be abolished. But slavery was not the only or most objectionable social ill. Speedy progress was also objectionable because it disrupted natural processes of evolution. Faced with slavery and the prospect of abolition, one could plausibly argue a defense for the institution and for a delay in its dissolution, yet still be troubled. These reflections allowed low-country people to guard slavery in their own region and oppose it in the up-country. There was little or no hypocrisy in their vision of virtuous, free, white yeoman laboring without the contamination of enslaved blacks. For their part, however, backcountry whites clamored for the contagion. In opposition to low-country rationales of slavery as an unfortunate necessity in disease-ridden semi- tropics-related as it often was to restrictive land policies and legislative hegemony- they offered a Herrenvolk vision of economic and political democracy based on black labor. The demand for equal access to land and slaves created in miniature a South Carolina version of the subsequent dispute between North and South in the territories, and became a cornerstone of the South's racist political economy. Only gradually did it displace an earlier, more specific proslavery argument. Her focus on white people does not lead Chaplin to neglect their relationships with black or red people. Unlike their compatriots farther north, whites in the lower South did not regard Indians as noble savages. Rather they saw them as an obstacle to progress; they represented a stage of arrested development beyond which whites strove to advance. Their idea of simple virtue did not embrace Native Americans nor any of those (including white hunters and trappers) who lived like them. But their quest for advancement, for civility over savagery, led more often to talk of ameliorating rather than abolishing African bondage. Growth of a creole black population forced whites to recognize the blacks' humanity; and, contrary to what Ira Berlin has suggested, even here Revolutionary ideology had affects. Thus Georgia planter William Baldwin could concede that "racial slavery was 'subversive of every idea of moral as well as political justice' " (p. 59) and yet deny the logic of that deduction. Chaplin also notes the irony</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 467 of the fact that cotton-first produced extensively by slaves for domestic use during the Revolutionary era-initially represented a concession to the slaves' autonomy. The same crop became the most striking symbol of their descendants' bondage. Yet (in another context), she robs the cotton plant of the anthropomorphic character it assumes in some studies and makes the point that cotton didn't make the Cotton South; people did. Chaplin touches everything from disease to mechanical devices, philosophy to politics, regional conflict to social cohesion in this wide-ranging study. She does an exemplary job of integrating social thought with economic change and agricultural progress. Extremely well read, she engages the literature without meanness or carping. She offers a clear picture of a society that was at once distinct from and a precursor to the antebellum South about which so much continues to be written. Willie Lee Rose and Michael Mullin set out years ago to write an evolutionary history of slavery; to rupture the tendency to look at the earlier forms of the' institution from the vantage point of its later developments. Chaplin has done the same for a region. No student of the South can afford to overlook this study. DANIEL C. LITTLEFIELD, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</page></plain_text>
