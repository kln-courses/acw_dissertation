<plain_text><page sequence="1">Doctoral Dissertations and Master's Theses in Japanese Language, Linguistics, and Literature Compiled and Edited by Frank Joseph Shulman This section, inaugurated with the September 1975 issue of the Journal of the Association of Teachers of Japanese and continued in some twenty- five issues published since that year, constitutes an ongoing effort to pro- vide authoritative information about recently completed doctoral disser- tations and master's theses dealing in their entirety or just in part with the language, linguistics, literature, and drama of Japan. Intended as a ser- vice for scholars, students, and librarians in the academic world, this in- formation is compiled and edited only for the purpose of increasing scholarly awareness of important research in the field of Japanese stud- ies, providing the authors of the dissertations and theses that are cited with greater visibility among their colleagues, and promoting scholarship in additional ways that may ultimately advance the frontiers of human and scientific knowledge. While the majority of the bibliographical en- tries in each issue of the journal refer to studies undertaken in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, whenever possible we also seek to call attention to pertinent research completed in continental Euro- pean, Australasian, and Asian institutions of higher learning. Each bibliographical entry provides the author's full name and year of birth (if known), the complete title and subtitle of his or her dissertation, the university and calendar year of the completed thesis or of the author's degree, the name of the author's adviser/supervisor or thesis committee chairperson, the complete pagination of the dissertation typescript, and a citation of the source of the abstract that in most cases constitutes the descriptive annotation. The abstracts (edited in most cases and, in some cases, extensively rewritten for clarity of presentation) are published to- gether with their abbreviated tables of contents whenever the latter are readily available. The doctoral dissertations and master's theses whose summaries have appeared in Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) and in Master 's Abstracts International (MAI) respectively are accompa- nied by the appropriate DAI or MAI volume, issue, and page numbers citing the source of the abstract in those two serial publications as well as by their UMI order numbers (e.g., UM 9978242; UM 3131513).

Learner Autonomy, Teacher Autonomy and the Process of Becoming a Pro- Autonomy Teacher: Theoretical Perspectives and Life Stories of Six Teachers ofJapanese as a Second Language.

In this dissertation, I explore how teachers may develop their understanding of and a positive attitude towards learner autonomy. Part One consists of two chap- ters. In Chapter One, I compare the definitions of learner autonomy that are found in the relevant literature and examine how theorists differ in their inter- pretation of the term. The discrepancies are attributed to (a) the social context in which each author works, (b) the fact that our understanding of learner auton- omy is always tentative and in flux, and (c) loose definitions of some technical terms in psychology. I do not make any value judgment of existing definitions because each one must be evaluated against the context in which it is put to use 233</page><page sequence="4">Japanese Language and Literature and examining each context was beyond the scope of the present dissertation. I give, instead, the definition of learner autonomy that I have developed in my work context and elaborate on it. For me, learner autonomy is a modular ca- pacity that exists in relation to others and in one's social context, allowing one to make choices concerning one's own learning in the service of one's wishes and aspirations. My definition emphasizes the interdependent nature of learner au- tonomy and the social and affective as well as cognitive aspects of the concept. In chapter Two, I review the literature on the teacher's role in the develop- ment of learner autonomy. A common claim in these writings is that learning in support of the development of second language learner autonomy involves much more than acquiring a new set of knowledge/skills. It entails acquiring a particu- lar kind of personal quality. My review of second language teacher educators' accounts of their practice indicates that many treat reflective practice, action research and teacher autonomy almost as synonymous. The successes which these practitioners claim are found to be either rather limited or not fully speci- fied. The remainder of the chapter examines the concepts of reflective practice, action research and teacher autonomy separately and discusses their relevance to the capacity of the teachers to support learner autonomy. Part Two of the dissertation comprises eight chapters. Chapter Three describes the research procedure and explains the rationale behind my choices. I chose Donald E. Polkinghorne's (1988; 1995) narrative analysis as my research meth- odology but with some modifications. Six teachers of Japanese as a second lan- guage who in my view have a positive attitude towards learner autonomy were interviewed twice about significant events and people that influenced their thinking about learner autonomy. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and edited. The edited transcripts were checked by each interviewee. Then I wrote a story starting from each teacher's childhood and running through to the present and had it checked by each teacher. Each of Chapters Four to Nine presents a life story. In Chapter Ten, I draw together the threads of the six stories and claim that (a) the kind of commitment pro-autonomy teachers have is commitment of self to learners; (b) the seed of this commitment is likely to be the development of their personal autonomy, their early interest in and empathic understanding of what may be called the foreign, social awareness, and autonomous foreign lan- guage learning experience; and (c) the factors which may accelerate the process of becoming a pro-autonomy teacher includes observing and talking to learners, teacher autonomy as freedom, supportive colleagues and teacher educators, and knowledge of some academic disciplines and other genres of relevant literature. Based on these claims, I suggest that (a) participation in a teacher education programme specifically focused on learner autonomy should be voluntary, (b) interest in foreign and social awareness may be screening criteria, where pos- sible, while second language competence, degree of personal autonomy and commitment to the profession may not make good criteria, and (c) one way to develop the required commitment in teachers may be to build a community of learner autonomy practitioners in which pre-service teachers and newly initiated in-service teachers can participate. I also offer some recommendations on cur- riculum and teaching practicum and emphasize the need to cultivate teachers' 234</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts narrative knowledge. In concluding the dissertation, I suggest that rewriting a curriculum is not enough to change educational practices in favour of learner au- tonomy. [Abstract on pages iii-iv of Aoki's dissertation].

Using a Diglot Reader to Teach Kanji: The Effects of Audio and Romaji on the Acquisition of Kanji Vocabulary. Brigham Young University [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Instructional Psychology and Technology). Chairperson/ Major Adviser: Paul F. Merrill. xii, 124p. DAI 66, no.5 (Nov. 2005): 1678-A; UM 3176260. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a computer- based Japanese/English diglot reader on the breadth and depth of the acquisition of kanji-words. On a diglot reader, L2 text is embedded in L1 text, thereby en- abling L2 learners to receive enough context to understand the L2 text and learn vocabulary in it. This study was also conducted to determine the effects of two methods of presenting the pronunciation of kanji-words-audio recording and romaji-on the acquisition of the meaning and pronunciation of kanji-words as well as the overall effect of the learning of pronunciation on the learning and re- tention of meaning. Eighty-one university students enrolled in first-year Japanese classes partici- pated in this study. They were divided into four groups, and each group received a version of the diglot reader with a different presentation of pronunciation for self-study. One group received the reader with audio recording and romaji, one with audio only, one with romaji only, and the one with neither of them. A fifty- item kanji pretest, a posttest, and a retention test were administered. The posttest was administered immediately after the experiment and the retention test was administered one week later. The results show that overall, the participants gained the meaning of twenty- one words and the pronunciation of seventeen words through the diglot reader. For the most part, they gained the depth of knowledge of kanji-words that al- lowed them to understand the meaning of the words, but not to write sentences with them. The retention rates for meaning and pronunciation were both .73 one week after the completion of reading. No significant effects of audio and romaji notation of pronunciation were found on the learning of meaning of kanji-words. Those who learned both the meaning and the pronunciation of kanji-words, however, had a higher retention rate of kanji meaning than those who learned only the meaning, thus suggesting that there is a benefit of learning pronunciation along with meaning when learn- 235</page><page sequence="6">Japanese Language and Literature ing kanji. The results also indicated that when participants received pronunci- ation information in one form while reading, either in audio or romaji, giving an additional form of pronunciation information did not have significant effects on their learning of pronunciation.

Most partici- pants reported that they had studied Japanese either formally or informally be- fore enrolling in the courses. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Literature Review. 3. Method. 4. Results. 5.

This dissertation set out to provide a thick and rich description of interpreta- tions and understandings of the complex nature of international telecollabora- tion, including (a) the relationship between participants, computer technologies, and contexts; (b) cross-cultural contradictions; and (c) learning. To achieve this objective, the study examined the long distance computer mediated communica- tion in four WebCT forums which joined fifty-two Japanese, thirty-seven Mexi- can, and forty-six Russian English learners. The sources of data consisted of the written transcripts of the online ex- changes, interviews, pre- and post-project surveys, journals, and participant ob- servations. The analysis of data was framed within my model of Intercultural Context-Embedded Telecollaborative Activity (ICETA, an expanded version of the Activity System model by Yrj6 Engestrdm, 1987) and was structured within three broad dimensions: Contexts, Contradictions, and Learning. The "Contexts" dimension included the characteristics of geopolitical structures, institutional contexts, context of interaction, and students' agency. Emphasis was placed on defining the extent to which the students shaped the environments and the environments shaped the students' participation. "Contradictions" captured the how, and "Learning" the what aspects of interaction. The study illustrates how affordances of multiple contextual layers defined 236</page><page sequence="7">Abstracts students' participation trajectories, their objectives, motivation or unwillingness to interact, and their attitudes towards one another. The Japanese and Mexican students' participation represented an interactive learning paradigm whereas the participation of the Russian students represented a curriculum teacher-centered paradigm. Depending on their identity of deep, strategic or surface communi- cators, the students demonstrated differences in the quality of their participation. The study identified eight major contradictions attributed to the students' different cultures-of-use of the computer technologies (Steven Thorne, 2003) and to the different frames of reference with regard to their norms of language use and beliefs about learning online. The study found evidence of both learning and not learning through content and discourse analysis of interaction protocols and students' interview and survey reports. Extending the ongoing discussion, the study emphasizes the importance of (a) students' cultures-of-use of computer technologies, mediated by instructors and by broader socio-cultural contexts, (b) students' frames of reference with regard to interaction and learning, and (c) students' agency in defining the meaning of being communicatively competent in international/intercultural online environ- ments.

An Investigation into Strategies Used in Interactive Videodisc (IVD) Tasks for Listening Comprehension of Japanese as a Second Language. Griffith Univer- sity [Australia], 1997 (M.Phil., Faculty of Education). Chairperson/Major Ad- viser: Marilyn McMeniman and James Garton. xiii, 280p. No published abstract. Contact the Griffith University Library (Nathan, Brisbane, Queensland 4111, Australia) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number QGU MtGravatt LB1044.75.B82 1997). This thesis investigated the listening strategies used by four tertiary students in an intermediate Japanese course during interactive videodisc (IVD) tasks. It examined the specific listening strategies used while engaged in the IVD tasks in order to gain insight into the possible effects of the IVD system on the development of language learning in listening skills... The think-aloud method was primarily used in this investigation together with retrospective interviews to support the data. The study found that the listening strategies of the learners included both higher (meaning) and lower (word iden- tification) level processes of the listening activity. In the two think-aloud ses- sions, most participants frequently used the relistening and inferencing strategies followed by rehearsing and organization strategies. The data revealed that the frequent use of the monitoring strategy was consistent in two of the participants 237</page><page sequence="8">Japanese Language and Literature in both of the sessions. It was not used consistently, however, by the other two participants. Further qualitative analysis of the listening strategies of each participant re- vealed difficulties with integrating and using both the higher and lower pro- cesses simultaneously. It seems that the focus of the participants during the IVD listening task was primarily on word and sound recognition, rather than on the construction of global meaning. The study thereby revealed that a lack of vo- cabulary knowledge and the misrepresentation of vocabulary in the participant's long term memory was a barrier to comprehension for most participants .... In order to define the possible effects of the IVD program on the development of listening skills, a new audio tape listening task was implemented prior to the IVD task in the second session. Improved results in listening comprehension in the IVD task over the audio tape was expected, as combinations of aural and visual media made input more comprehensible than aural alone. The more inter- esting finding, however, is that the participants were particularly encouraged to work on making sense of words by using relistening and rehearsing strategies in the IVD environment. The results indicated that the IVD program can be suc- cessfully used as a learning tool which impacts positively on the cognitive and metacognitive dimensions of learners' strategy use. The study revealed advan- tages in using the IVD system over the traditional audio tape method for lis- tening comprehension. Despite the IVD program's advantages, however, there still is a need to develop even more highly sophisticated help functions, for ex- ample dictionary and grammar checks. The thesis concluded with recommendations for further investigation into the role of training and guidance strategy which may lead to the most effective lan- guage listening within an IVD environment.

Student-Teachers' Use of Microteaching Activity to Construct Sociolinguistic Knowledge within a Japanese Immersion Initial Teacher Education Program in Australia.

In 1993, the first preservice teacher education degree program delivered 238</page><page sequence="9">Abstracts through Japanese immersion was established at Central Queensland University in Australia. The aim of the degree program was to graduate a multiskilled teacher with specialisations in Japanese as a Foreign Language (JFL), primary education and immersion. While immersion education over the past thirty years has been extensively implemented and researched at the primary and secondary level, as a pedagogic practice, it remains undertheorised, underconceptualised and underresearched at the post-secondary level. Previous research has highlighted how immersion students fail to acquire target-like proficiency in sociolinguistic and grammatical competence. One way to facilitate student acquisition of sociolinguistic knowledge is through func- tional-analytic tasks. What is still unclear is (a) how the social interplay of group dynamics within a functional-analytic task frames individual learning, (b) how students actually come to construct such understandings in the moment-to- moment interactions that take place within such tasks, and (c) how the task itself may mediate students' learning. Using a Vygotskian framework, I studied a cohort of immersion student- teachers over a twelve-week period in the first half of 1999. The student- teachers were engaged in a particular functional-analytic task, namely micro- teaching planning activity. The aim of the study was to investigate how student- teachers come to construct sociolinguistic knowledge about JFL use for teach- ing. The results indicate that the ability of student-teachers to construct new sociolinguistic understandings is highly variable and that their participation in a functional-analytic task alone does not guarantee learning success. The factors which contributed to microgenetic development include (a) student-teachers' re- ceptivity to engage with and appropriate mediational tools, (b) sensitivity about making judgments and acting on the nature and quality of regulative assistance, mediational tools and dialogic interaction, and (c) ability to strategically manage dialogic interaction. Other findings arising out of this study include the fact that (d) the use of the L1, even within an immersion context, is a necessary semiotic tool used by student-teachers to enhance L2 understanding, (e) the use of native speakers within group activity does not guarantee productive interaction, (f) the higher the level of collaborative work within groups, the more student-teachers find op- portunities to develop a sense of socialisation into a community of JFL teaching practice, and (g) the types of sociolinguistic understandings constructed within microteaching functional-analytic activity incorporate ways of using JFL in a classroom, ways of qualifying JFL within instructional activities and ways of using professionally related jargon to talk about JFL teaching. Finally, this study provides a means to conceptualise immersion education as a multidimensional social process involving not only a second language but also a second culture uniquely framed by its socio-historical context.

Effects of Semantic Radical Information Types on Inferring the Meaning of Unfamiliar Kanji among Native Speakers and Foreign Language Learners of Japanese. Carnegie Mellon University [United States], 2004 (Ph.D. in Modem Languages). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Keiko Koda. xii, 121p. DAI 66, no.9 (Mar. 2006); UM 3186026. This dissertation explored the impact of morphological properties on inferring unfamiliar kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese) among native speakers and Japanese as a foreign language learners. Research has shown that incidental word learning, essential in vocabulary acquisition, entails word-meaning infer- ence (R. J. Jenkins, B. Motlock, and B. T. Slocum, 1989; E. Nagy and R. C. An- derson, 1984). Investigations involving alphabetic readers identify two essential competencies underlying successful inference: the abilities to extract morpho- logical information from unknown words, and to integrate contextual informa- tion with extracted morphological information. Vocabulary knowledge supports both of these competencies. To further explore these factors in a non-alphabetic language, this study examined inferential behaviors among native and non- native kanji users at Carnegie Mellon University. Three research questions were posed: (a) Does the functional salience of kanji components alter inferential behaviors? (b) Does it facilitate kanji meaning inference? and (c) Does character knowledge affect the way in which morphological information is used during kanji inferring? The results of the study demonstrated that among kanji users the functional salience of morphological components has a strong impact on inferential behav- iors, but it does not enhance inference accuracy, and that character knowledge, as well, affects kanji inference behaviors. These findings clearly imply that kanji users are sensitive to the functional salience of morphological components. Such sensitivity evolves gradually as kanji knowledge accumulates and guides infer- ence behaviors. In short, inference processes are constrained by morphological properties.

City University of New York [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Gita Marto- hardjono. xviii, 353p. DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2909-A; UM 3187373. This dissertation investigates the second language (L2) acquisition of aspec- tual morphology within the framework of formal, truth-conditional semantics (Tarski, 1944; Davidson, 1969). We evaluate the relative contribution of the na- tive language grammar and the input available to the learner in an effort to de- velop a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect. The focus is on the acquisition of the semantics of the forms that mark the progressive in English and Japanese. The two forms, be+ing in English and te- iru in Japanese, interact differently with the lexical aspect of the verb phrase to which they attach. In English, the progressive denotes an event-in-progress in- terpretation regardless of the verb. In Japanese, achievements such as die are in- compatible with a progressive interpretation, allowing only for a resultative in- terpretation of V+ te-iru (Jacobsen, 1992; McClure, 1995; Ogihara, 1998, 1999; Shirai, 2000, i.a.). The analysis that we adopt, McClure (1995), argues that the difference lies in the truth conditions of the aspectual operator PROD in the two languages. In a controlled, bidirectional, experimental study, we investigate the L2 acqui- sition of this crosslinguistic difference using two tasks: a grammaticality judg- ment task and an interpretation task. Adult learners from a range of proficiency levels are tested including a group of near-natives in the L2 English study. The results of the interpretation task suggest that learners have more difficulty pre- empting an interpretation that is not available in the L2, but is an option in the LI. Results also indicate that L2 learners have considerably less difficulty ad- ding an interpretation to their L2 grammar that is not available in the native lan- guage. We argue that these results can be accounted for if we consider the role of the input available to the learner. Our results also reveal that there are con- texts where L2 learners follow developmental patterns similar to L1 learners. We argue that a comprehensive model of the L2 acquisition of aspect must consider not only properties of the learner's grammar but also the role of input and how principles of learnability interact with the learners' grammatical repre- sentation in the course of development.

DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2819-A; UM 3185314. This critical instrumental case study examines what happens when my work- ing/middle-class students and I engage in transformative learning approaches to culture in a high school introductory foreign language class. Specifically, through analysis of scaffolded class discussions; student projects, written work, pre- and post-discussion responses; field notes; and interviews with focal stu- dents, this study seeks to answer (a) How students construct notions of cos- mological citizenship, spirituality, ecological awareness/interconnectedness, and value-creation through class activities; (b) How students perceive the connection of (a) to Japanese; (c) How students characterize the connection of (a) and (b) with their own lives and identities; and (d) How transformative learning affects the quality of students' second language acquisition. Findings reveal that through topic-centered dialogue-social construction-students developed transformative learning notions regarding the above questions both in the first and target language.

Previous studies have reported various advantages of the use of Computer- Mediated Communication (CMC) in second language acquisition. Since CMC has the attributes of interactive networked communications in written form, re- searchers have claimed that CMC has the characteristics of both speaking and writing and that we need to investigate the transfer of language skills from CMC performance into oral performance. It has been claimed that synchronous CMC 242</page><page sequence="13">Abstracts (chat) more effectively increases oral production than asynchronous CMC (bul- letin boards) and face-to-face discussions. No studies to date, however, have ex- amined the effects of synchronous and asynchronous CMC on the development of oral proficiency among learners of Japanese. In addition, none of the previous studies has closely examined whether there are any other factors that potentially correlate to the development of oral proficiency among individual students. The present study, therefore, has investigated the effects of synchronous and asynchronous CMC on the development of oral proficiency among learners of Japanese. Thirty-six novice learners of Japanese enrolled in fourth semester Japanese at Purdue University were involved. The participants were divided into three groups (synchronous and asynchronous CMC groups, and a face-to-face group). They had weekly discussions over the course of one semester. I then compared the gain in scores between the pre-test and the post-test among the three groups. The findings of the subjective ratings showed a significant dif- ference among the gains of the three groups, favoring the face-to-face group. Regarding factors potentially correlated to oral proficiency development, the present study found such factors as proficiency levels and attitudes toward dis- cussions to be related to the development of oral proficiency. I also found that the synchronous CMC group showed positive attitudes toward discussions and that the asynchronous CMC group achieved a higher level of syntactic complexity than the other two groups. Based on these findings, I made recommendations regarding instructional applications of CMC for the development of oral proficiency.

The effect of an intervention on study abroad outcomes has been studied be- fore the development of the Maximizing Study Abroad guides and the ensuing 243</page><page sequence="14">Japanese Language and Literature Research Project. This dissertation attempts to learn of students' perceptions of the culture learning process, comparing those of a control group and an experi- mental group from the original Maximizing Study Abroad Research Project, and to apply the results to a culture learning theory for the study abroad experience. The primary goal of this study is to understand study abroad students' percep- tions of the culture learning process and to relate these perceptions to Jack Mezi- row's (1991) Transformative Learning Theory. The intercultural field has mea- sured study abroad outcomes in the past. Contrary to the development of these outcomes' studies, less focus has been given to the development of a culture learning theory specifically related to the study abroad field. The secondary goal of this study is to compare the culture learning process of two populations of students, those who used the Maximizing Study Abroad guide while abroad and those who did not. Ten students from each group were inter- viewed with semi-structured questions. The participants also had to analyze a critical incident from a Japanese context to see if there were any differences in their understanding of underlying intercultural issues. The results demonstrate that there is a pattern for the specific culture learning theory proposed. The re- sults also show that a difference existed in how the students from the two groups articulated their culture learning and to what extent they understood the under- lying cultural issues in the critical incident. The effect of an intervention on culture learning during the study abroad pro- cess on students' perceptions of the culture learning process raise questions con- cerning how students approach culture learning effectively while abroad. This study attempts to understand how two different groups approach culture learn- ing. In addition, application of Mezirow's (1991) Transformative Learning The- ory to the culture learning process, creates the basis for the operationalization of a culture learning theory for the study abroad experience.

Integrating Learning Strategies, Time Management and Anxiety-Free Learn- ing in a Tertiary-Level Course in Basic Japanese: An Intervention Study.

This dissertation is concerned with the value of a set of teaching and learning intervention procedures designed to improve the success rate of students who take first-year Japanese at an Australian university. Prompted by the then high attrition rate in the introductory first year course at the University of Sydney, the empirical aspects of this study began with a survey of the factors that contributed to success in learning Japanese as a foreign lan- guage. In particular, it focused on learning script as it is a key component in mastering Japanese. The results of the survey, along with recommendations taken from the research literature, were then used to develop a suite of interven- tion techniques designed to increase the rate of success. This phase of the project was conducted during 1996-1997. The study focused on three issues within the script classes as prominent as- pects of acquiring Japanese as a foreign language: (a) instructing students in ef- fective learning strategies, (b) improving academic time management skills, and (c) providing an enjoyable, anxiety-free learning environment for lifting motiva- tion. Four intervention techniques were prepared for the incoming first-year stu- dents in 1997. These techniques were designated as "My Goals and Success", "Exercises and My Progress", "Learning Strategies Report", and Fumie Kato's Homepage, and were implemented in the scripting classes as an intervention study throughout the 1997 academic year. Another aspect investigated was the differences between those first year learn- ers with a background of experience with an ideographic writing system against those who were familiar only with European writing systems. It was known by experience at the University of Sydney that learners with a background knowl- edge of ideographic writing systems, such as Chinese or Korean, found the first year Japanese course considerably less taxing than students without such previ- 245</page><page sequence="16">Japanese Language and Literature ous experience. Little was known in detail, however, as to how this experience influenced the way that students went about learning Japanese. Accordingly, the opportunity was taken to employ student background as a factor of interest. The outcomes of this research suggested that the intervention techniques im- proved the success rate and academic achievement of students in 1997. The type of effect, however, differed between the two types of students. The students with a background in an ideographic writing system appeared to benefit more than the students with a background only of a phonographic writing system when im- provement is measured by rate of success and academic achievement. The latter group, however, significantly lifted their motivation and gained more from learning strategy instruction and time management practice than the group with a background of an ideographic writing system. It was further found that the methods used for learning kanji, the general lan- guage learning strategies that were favored, the preferences for teaching pro- cedures, and the needs for assistance were different between the two groups of learners. On the basis of this study, it was concluded that although the intervention techniques employed were effective, and would be useful even in teaching both types of learners in a common curriculum within a common course, Japanese language educators should consider paying greater attention to the language ex- perience differences of learners as a correlate of differences in preferred modes of instruction and learning.

Cultural Compatibility in Educational Contexts: Japanese Native-Speaker Teachers in Australian Classrooms. University of Queensland [Australia], 2000 (Ph.D. in Asian Languages and Studies). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Megan Jennaway. xv, 402p. No published abstract. Contact the Fryer Library, Univer- sity of Queensland (Brisbane, Qld. 4072, Australia) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number THE13868). This dissertation examines the compatibility between the culture of teachers who are native speakers of Japanese and the culture of their students in Aus- tralian classrooms. The teachers who comprise the subjects of this study are in- dividuals who completed all of their formal education (i.e., through the tertiary level) in Japan; the students are English-speaking Australian students without any regard to their cultural origin. The dissertation argues that there is a "culture of learning" specific to any educational context, which is established through the 246</page><page sequence="17">Abstracts interaction of the cultures of those who are involved-the teachers and the stu- dents-as well as by the social, political and historical factors and the physical environment that surround them. Such a culture of learning affects how the teachers function in their classrooms, or more specifically, how they control their students. This poses a major challenge to beginning teachers, especially to those who lack experience in being students within that cultural context. Exam- ining the culture of learning illuminates the mechanism of classroom control in order that the teachers who are new to the culture can gain some understanding of the underlying culture essential to their optimal performance. This dissertation consists of a three-stage study, each one of which is self- contained but contains developmental layers of teaching and learning culture: (a) a comparative study of exchange students in Japan and Australia that focuses on their perceptions about teachers, students, learning, and the classroom in their respective host country; (b) a group of trainee teachers that discusses their ex- periences in a teaching practicum; and (c) first-year teachers, native speaker of Japanese, that examines their difficulties, teaching strategies and classroom communication. Of particular interest are the detailed examinations of the lan- guage used in the classroom by these Japanese teachers and its effects on the culture of learning. This is examined in a detailed comparative study with teach- ers who are native speakers of English and who are familiar with the local cul- ture of learning. The research concludes that knowledge of the local "culture" of learning is es- sential for all educators and that training in the relevant cultural context is par- ticularly important for teachers who are new to the culture. The dissertation also suggests that developing awareness about the role of "culture of learning" is a responsibility of all educators who work in cross-cultural contexts, something that currently applies to the majority of teachers. There is the need for an instru- ment which will help educators identify the degree of cultural compatibility among their instructional approaches, the curriculum and their students. The dis- sertation also challenges those who employ teachers from overseas to indicate clearly what is meant by successful teaching in the local context and how new teachers may achieve it. Finally, the dissertation asserts that it is the professional responsibility of teachers to become aware of the nature of both their own culture and that of their students in order to facilitate the students' learning. This includes the de- velopment of a "communicative competence" that is specific to the given con- text. Furthermore, the difficulties caused by cultural incompatibility should not be attributed to a "lack of assertiveness" inherent in the teachers, to their "per- sonal incompetence", or to an irreconcilable "cultural difference", but rather to a lack of relevant experience and support, which implies a clear need for specific training.

This thesis examined the process by which students learning Japanese choose between the particles ni and de. Twenty-nine native speakers of English who were enrolled in a Japanese language program participated in this study. They were divided into three groups according to their level of proficiency. The learn- ers' strategies of particle choice were investigated using the think-aloud and im- mediate retrospective method. The distance between a particle and the verb also was analyzed for its effect on the type of strategies used by the learners and on their accurate choice of particle. The results suggested that accurate particle choice was related to the use of metalinguistic knowledge but not to the learners' proficiency levels. Further- more, the distance between the target particle and the verb did not affect the types of strategy. The findings addressed the significance of the attention to those learners' strategies in particle instructions. [Abstract on page iii of Mad- dock's thesis]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2.

This study is an investigation of the reward systems for Assistant Language 248</page><page sequence="19">Abstracts Teachers (ALTs) at a private ALT dispatch/supply organization. In recent years, there has been a substantial growth in the number of ALTs employed from pri- vate organizations. The general reason for this inquiry is the lack of discussion about what is important to ALTs regarding reward systems from a human rela- tions management perspective, and an over-concentration on how to manage rapid and expansive growth in an emergent market in the personnel sense. The effect of reward systems on the perceptions of equity and alternative reward systems is the main point of inquiry. A survey of ALT reward system perceptions was made, including a survey of ALT perceptions, pertinent docu- ments, and interviews with organization stakeholders. The result of this investi- gation is that the reward systems generally do not contribute to perceptions of equity. Alternative reward systems are generally not appealing to ALTs, and appear to have little influence on motivation. The implication of these findings point towards the need to better harmonize reward systems in a manner that in- creases equity. These results touch on general human relations management themes such as recruiting, training, evaluation, retention and turnover. [Abstract on page i of McDonough's thesis]. Contents: 1.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Lorraine E. Kumpf. vi, 103p. Master's Abstracts International 44, no.4 (Aug. 2006): 1082; UM 1431804. This thesis examines the knowledge that English speaking adult learners have of the use of Japanese case particles. The study seeks to determine which case particles are more accurately expressed than others, and the possible factors for this difference. It also examines the relationship between learners' own percep- tions of difficulty and their accuracy in using the particles, and finally, the types of rationales that learners employ when they choose a particle. The study used the cloze test and verbal protocol for the investigation. The results showed that learners had difficulty in identifying particles with multi function-form relationship, non-prototypical use, and use that is distinct from their native language. As for these difficult particles, there was a non-propor- tional relationship between the learners' perception of difficulty on the one hand and, on the other hand, accuracy in their use. There were three kinds of strate- gies which learners employ depending on the nature of particles: the use of intu- ition, the use of English translation, and the application of their linguistic knowl- edge of Japanese.

University of Southern California [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Education). Chairperson/ Major Adviser: Robert S. Rueda. xi, 115p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2073-A; UM 3180403. This study explored the differences in the motivational beliefs of 277 Ameri- can high school students who were learning the Japanese language. It posed the question, "How do those beliefs differ in Japanese heritage students (n=135) from those of non-Japanese heritage students (n = 142)"? The sample consisted of 154 (55.6%) females and 123 (44%) males. The research explored nine moti- vational variables: (a) heritage-related motivation, (b) integrative motivation, (c) travel-related motivation, (d) instrumental motivation, (e) intrinsic motivation, (f) self-efficacy, (g) effort, (h) goal specificity, and (i) goal strategy. The data were collected through a questionnaire. Factor analyses, t tests, MANOVA, one- way ANOVAs, regression procedures, and correlation coefficients addressed the research question. This study tested the following hypotheses: (HI) With parental influence, Japanese heritage students are more motivated in learning Japanese than non- Japanese heritage students. (H2) High-efficacy non-Japanese heritage students exert effort and strive for academic success, whereas-even with lower effi- cacy-Japanese heritage students exert effort and strive for academic success. (H3) Japanese heritage students set higher goals for themselves, even with lower self-efficacy, than Euro-American students. (H4) Japanese heritage students ex- pend more effort to reach their higher goals than do Euro-American students. The results showed that Japanese language learners of the three groups (Japa- nese heritage [n= 135], non-Japanese heritage Asian students [n= 69], and non- Asian [n = 73]) differed in heritage-related motivation, intrinsic motivation, self- efficacy, and goal specificity. For the hypotheses, the findings revealed the fol- lowing: (H1) With parental influence, Japanese heritage students were definitely motivated in learning the Japanese language. (H2) For Japanese heritage stu- dents, effort correlated positively with self-efficacy, whereas effort correlated negatively with self-efficacy for non-Japanese heritage Asians and non-Asians. Even though this result did not support the second hypothesis, the data revealed that socio-cultural differences existed in correlations between self-efficacy and effort. (H3) Goal specificity correlated significantly with self-efficacy in the three ethnic groups. (H4) This study did not support the fourth hypothesis. 250</page><page sequence="21">Abstracts Teachers and administrators may use the motivational findings to develop Japa- nese language programs specifically designed to help students of different ethnic backgrounds.

Applying a Lexical Approach to the Use of Authentic Texts with Beginners in Japanese. University of Dublin (Trinity College) [Ireland], 2001 (M.Phil. in Ap- plied Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: David Little. 85, 7p. and ap- pendices (unpaginated). No published abstract. Contact Trinity College Library (College Street, Dublin 2, Ireland) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number Thesis 6605). This thesis investigates the possible application of a lexical approach to the use of authentic texts with beginning learners of Japanese. The lexical approach is a particular model which enables learners to read authentic texts from the early stages. The use of authentic texts for beginning learners is often considered difficult because they have not acquired sufficient linguistic and vocabulary knowledge of the target language. In Japanese language teaching, their use is often considered too difficult in particular for learners from non-logographic lan- guage backgrounds because of the complicated writing system of Japanese. The lexical approach provides learners with scaffolding in order to compen- sate for their insufficient knowledge of the target language and enables them to understand authentic texts. Examples of this approach have been introduced pri- marily in European languages, and therefore this study explores the application of this approach in the Japanese language classroom. Particular consideration is given to the difficulties in reading Japanese and the skills and strategies which need to be developed for learners from non-logographic language backgrounds. Experimental classes were carried out in order to investigate whether or not the use of the lexical approach was effective for English-speaking learners of Japanese. Accompanying tests, interviews and questionnaires were given to the subjects for further analysis. Although test results did not explicitly reveal the nature of the learners' improvement, the experiments showed that the lexical approach enabled English-speaking learners of Japanese to understand authentic texts and to acquire skills and strategies in coping with authentic texts.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Alei- dine J. Moeller. 336p. (various pagings). DAI 67, no.2 (Aug. 2006): 495-A; UM 3208117. The purpose of this single case study was to explore authentic communication for Japanese language learning in second-year Japanese classes at a small, pri- vate university in the Midwest. The types of authentic Japanese communication and materials in and outside of the Japanese class were studied from four learn- ers' and one professor's perspectives. The data were collected throughout one academic year, the first semester of 2004 through the second semester of 2005. Multiple methods of data collection were used in this study including personal interviews, casual conversations, par- ticipant observation of classes and related events, and the study of relevant doc- uments including the textbook, students' study sheets, videos, oral exam tran- scripts, copies of e-mails, reflection sheets, and copies of web logs. Qualitative research procedures were used to study second-year Japanese lan- guage learners' authentic communication. The data were analyzed by categoriz- ing them into codes, then themes and sub-themes. Five themes emerged in this study: (a) the e-mail writing process, (b) the e-mail reading process, (c) the learning process, (d) learning through s-mail, and (e) authentic Japanese.

Does Instruction Help Learners Become Proficient in L2 Writing? The Case of the Japanese Particles Wa, Ga, and the Passive. University of Oregon [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures: Japanese Language and Pedagogy). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Noriko Fujii and Tetsuo Harada. xvii, 267p. DAI 66, no.7 (Jan. 2006): 2560-A; UM 3181128. In order to be competent in second language writing, learners should know not only sentence-level grammar but also discourse rules, i.e., how to use linguistic items appropriately to create coherence. Language instruction, however, tends to emphasize sentence-level accuracy and neglect discourse-level instruction. Al- though researchers such as Richard G. Kern and Jean Marie Schultz (Modern Language Journal, 1992) maintained the importance of discourse-level instruc- tion, the effect of different types of discourse-level instruction has not been in- vestigated in second language acquisition studies. Thus, in order to help learners 252</page><page sequence="23">Abstracts become proficient in second language writing, it is imperative for researchers and language teachers to know what type of discourse-level grammar instruction is beneficial for learners to be able to use linguistic items appropriately in texts and become proficient writers. This dissertation compared the effects of two types of instruction, explicit grammar instruction (N = 12) and typographical enhancement (N = 14), on the acquisition of the discourse functions of Japanese particles, wa, ga, and the pas- sive construction, and investigated which type of instruction is beneficial for the learners. The study found that the effectiveness of instruction is influenced by the functions of the linguistic items and the readiness of the learners. The stu- dents seemed to be able to learn one function of ga from either type of in- struction, but they had difficulty in learning another function of ga from textual enhancement. The learner's readiness strongly affected language acquisition, es- pecially the acquisition of the passive, and neither type of instruction was found to be beneficial to learners who were not ready to learn the structure. The study also found that most students exhibited improvement immediately after the treat- ment and deterioration after 1.5 months without treatment. These results suggest potential benefits of using different types of instruction and the necessity of repetition of instruction. Since it is difficult for researchers and language teachers to determine what type of instruction is most beneficial for certain linguistic items and whether or not students are ready to learn a cer- tain linguistic item, it will be most beneficial for students if we provide different types of instruction at different times during language instruction.

This dissertation is an ethnographic/qualitative case study of a teacher study group for Japanese language teachers, held at an intensive Japanese summer pro- gram located in Japan. The five study group members met regularly and ex- plored the transactional model of teaching and learning. The group studied the transactional model theory and its application in a university Japanese course. 253</page><page sequence="24">Japanese Language and Literature Multiple data sources, including fieldnotes, teacher study group meeting tran- scripts, interview transcripts, participants' journals, background questionnaires, program handbooks, flyers, syllabi, and lesson plans were collected over the eight week research period. A focused recursive coding and analysis process was used to generate descriptive themes and theories that explained the research events and participants' experiences. The teacher study group resulted in two members transforming their theory and practice. These two members were selected for in-depth case study. The re- searcher also analyzed her own experience as the third case study, and analyzed the conflicts and challenges she encountered as a member of the teacher study group. The major findings include: common processes and factors for teacher change, complexity of socio-cultural/socio-political environments of a teacher study group, and the challenge of participant observation within teacher study group research.

It in- vestigates the listening strategies used by tertiary-level learners of Japanese as a foreign language in non-interactional listening tasks. The dissertation addresses four research questions: (a) What are the listening strategies used by native speakers of Japanese (L1) and by above-average proficiency (AA) and below- average proficiency (BAP) tertiary-level learners of Japanese as a foreign lan- guage who are Australian-English speakers, in audiovisual and audio-only lis- tening contexts? (b) How does the voice medium in different genres (television news broadcasts and television family dramas) influence these speakers' listen- ing strategies in audiovisual and audio-only listening contexts? (c) What are the similarities and differences in strategy use in audiovisual and audio-only listen- ing contexts between the L group and the AAS and BAP L2 subgroups; what are the effective strategies used by these speakers; and what types of strategies should be included in an instructional package for an effective intervention pro- 254</page><page sequence="25">Abstracts gram? and (d) Does the listening strategy intervention program developed in this study result in more strategic listening in Japanese? The research was conducted in two stages. The first study pursued refinement of a listening strategy classification scheme for use in the second study. The sec- ond study sought to develop, administer, and evaluate the efficacy of a listening strategy intervention program. The participants' verbal data were collected and analyzed, using the think-aloud protocol method, which is most effective for capturing listeners' on-line processing of authentic Japanese satellite texts.

University of Iowa [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Second Language Acquisition). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Richard R. Hurtig. xii, 270p. DAI 67, no.1 (July 2006): 168-A; UM 3202964. Native speakers can identify second language learners based on their non- native prosody. This perception of foreignness influences native speakers' im- pression of the second language learners (i.e., learners tend to be perceived as socially inferior to speakers of the target language group). Researchers in second language acquisition have investigated prosodic problems of Japanese learners including mastery of long/short vowel distinctions, usage of accent patterns, and sentence intonation patterns. Japanese learners' productions, however, often in- volve problems at multiple levels of the prosodic system; thus we need to inves- tigate their productions from an integrative point of view. Willem J. M. Levelt's speech production model proposed the existence of a prosody generator that is integral to the phonological encoding process. The model assumes an integration of segmental, metrical, syntactic and intentional information in order to con- struct prosodic constituents. Using this model, we can assume that second lan- guage learners' speech sounds non-native-like because the prosody generator either lacks information or that some of the information arrives at the generator more slowly. Japanese learners with a range of proficiency levels and native speakers par- ticipated in production and perception tasks which elicited their ability to pro- duce/perceive mora timing, word accent, prosodic cues to mark syntactic struc- tures, and interrogative sentence intonation. Furthermore, spontaneous narratives were collected, which became stimuli for native speaker judgment tasks of com- prehensibility and accentedness. All oral data were analyzed with computer speech analysis software to determine moraic durations and pitch patterns. 255</page><page sequence="26">Japanese Language and Literature The results consistently indicate that Japanese learners have difficulty produc- ing native-like prosody at multiple levels, although it is apparent that advanced learners could produce higher level prosody (i.e., phrasal and sentential levels) better than lower proficiency learners. Japanese learners performed very poorly on perception tasks, illustrating their low perceptual ability. Native speaker judgments reveal that even advanced learners' narratives were perceived to be accented; proficiency levels and the accentedness scores were negatively corre- lated. The comparison of various components of prosody, in both production and perception, together with ratings of global foreign accentedness made it possible to identify the components of second language acquisition that contribute to make the learner's prosody more native-like or more non-native-like.

This thesis discusses the use of the Sheltered Initiation Language Learning (SILL) method to teach Japanese communicatively. Its more specific goal is to develop a coherent method for teaching Japanese effectively by combining ease of learning and communicative potential. The thesis first introduces a number of problems in teaching Japanese, determines the areas of particular difficulty, and evaluates various textbooks. This is followed by an overview of approaches and methods, including a discussion of M. Pienemann's Teachability Hypothesis. The Audiolingual Method, Natural Approach, Communicative Language Teach- ing, and Sheltered Initiation Language Learning are the methods discussed. The thesis suggests the injection of a more clearly communicative focus into SILL. The resulting method is applied to the teaching of speaking in Japanese, with a focus on grammatical sequencing, vocabulary selection and sequencing, and in- teractive topics. The same idea is also applied to the teaching of writing in Japa- nese. An overview of the Japanese writing system is presented and the se- quencing and selection of characters and symbols are discussed. The concluding chapter focuses on effective classroom activities, with an overview of common activities as well as their evaluation. SILL comprehension exercises are also dis- cussed and exemplified.

This thesis attempted to narrate some stories relating to the heritage language development of five second-generation Japanese-Canadian students in the Great- er Toronto area. The study focused on the salient factors that contributed to the enhancement of their heritage language ability. A qualitative approach, based on reflexive ethnography methodology, was employed to allow the researcher to be reflective on the research process, and to make the relationships between the researcher and the researched visible. The salient factors that were found to have affected the students' heritage language skills included the role of their parents, the promotion of Japanese as a heritage language through attendance at Japanese school, their involvement in Japanese language-related pastimes, visits to Japan, their interaction with Japanese Canadian friends, and their maintenance of a positive outlook. The students' current proficiency in Japanese was observed to be the result of multifaceted efforts that both the students and their parents had made over many years.

This study examined the relationship between the production and the per- ception of Japanese word-initial stops by adult native speakers of Korean who were learning Japanese. Their perceptions of the speech of a native speaker of Japanese, as well as their perceptions of their own speech, were examined. Eighteen Koreans produced the word-initial stop voicing contrast, and the ac- curacy of their production was judged by ten native speakers of Japanese. These same learners of Japanese then completed identification tests which judged their perceptual accuracy of their own pre-recorded production (intemal perception) as well as their perception of a native Japanese speaker's production (external perception). The results of the comparison among their production, external per- ception and internal perception showed that (a) external perception was more ac- curate than internal perception, (b) perception precedes production, and (c) there was a correlation between internal perception and production. These findings indicated the importance of examining internal perception in order to investigate the second language learner's phonetic categorization and the relationship be- tween perception and production.

The learning of kanji is a demanding, complicated and time-consuming task, but it is fundamental for adult learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) who are acquiring written communication skills in Japanese. This dissertation examines how learners proceduralize kanji knowledge (graphemic, semantic and phonemic representations) with reference to a skill learning model. It also ex- plores the type of kanji learning strategies that learners draw on, and how they use those strategies. These learning processes are then examined in relation to the outcomes of the participants' performance. Following a naturalistic inquiry for the qualitative analysis, empirical data from multiple sources were obtained over the course of two semesters of tertiary level JFL study during which learners interacted with the multimedia CALL program, KanjiSensee, developed for this study. The seventeen participants, fal- ling into three groups, represented a typical distribution for JFL beginner classes 258</page><page sequence="29">Abstracts in Australia: students without any previous learning experience of Japanese (the "no-J" group), students with some learning experience of Japanese as a second language (target language) (the "yes-J" group), and students having a kanji background in their first language (the "yes-K" group). Due to the small number of participants, one should be cautious in generalizing from the results. Appar- ently, however, while frequent interaction with KanjiSensee may activate accu- rate production supported by self-testing and thorough practice of kanji, it may not always be associated with high performance. The negative attitudes of learn- ers towards CALL methods may be associated with low outcomes from the viewpoint of strategy use. The main outcomes of this research suggest that the salient impact of KanjiSensee is its capacity to promote input enhancement, while text modifica- tion on the screen is invaluable for the various needs of individual learners in processing and retaining information about kanji. Above all, the study showed that CALL methods and the transferability of strategy and kanji knowledge from first language learners affect the choice of strategy use. Irrespective of the learn- ers' backgrounds and CALL methods, however, the "Planning your Learning" strategy is essential for managing the entire kanji learning process while the "Frequency" strategy (repetitive writing practice) is indispensable for automati- zation, cognitively and strategically. I furthermore found that contextual learning could promote the expansion of kanji vocabulary and text processing skills. Further study is recommended to examine contextual learning dealing with the introduction of phonetic radicals from the beginning level by designing a special "help" function in CALL pro- grams to sensitize learners to the phonological properties of kanji at lexical and sub-lexical levels.

This preliminary study investigated the effectiveness of the Strategy Inventory 259</page><page sequence="30">Japanese Language and Literature for Learning Kanji (SILK) test instrument as an awareness raising activity for kanji learning strategies in a Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) classroom context. While few studies have been conducted in this context, the nature of kanji learning necessitates learner autonomy and the use of learning strategies to make the task of learning kanji easier. The current learning strategy instruction debate, based on cognitive theory and the results of empirical studies, has suggested replacing time consuming and often ineffective explicit instructional approaches with awareness raising activ- ities. A need has been expressed by practitioners in this field to further inves- tigate effective awareness raising activities as a viable alternative for learning strategy instruction. This study involved eighty-four participants who were enrolled in second and third year JFL study at the Gold Coast campus of Griffith University in Queens- land, Australia. Learners' attitudes towards SILK and its effectiveness as a learning strategy awareness raising activity were investigated through SILK test implementation and the use of questionnaires and interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed that in the Griffith University learning context, the SILK test instrument was an effective and efficient means of raising kanji learners' awareness of learning strategies. This suggests the potential of the SILK test instrument as a pedagogical tool for awareness raising, and a viable activity for inclusion in learning strategy instruction. The results of this study are significant in contributing to pedagogical developments at Griffith Univer- sity and in providing data to allow for future cross contextual comparison.

DAI 65, no.11 (May 2005): 4179-A; UM 3155030. This dissertation is an inquiry into the socialization process of listening and speaking in a Japanese elementary school classroom. Ethnographic research was conducted in Town Elementary School (a pseudonym) in the Hokuriku area of Japan. Seikatsuka "Daily Living" classes were video taped and used to deter- mine the process through which first grade children were socialized to listen and speak in culturally appropriate ways in the classroom. The socialization of listening is illustrated through the establishment of rules related to: sitting posture, turn selection, desk configuration, and negative as- sessments with footing shifts. All of the listening rules that were established 260</page><page sequence="31">Abstracts during this lesson emerged out of the failure of the children to listen during their whole-class discussions. A trouble source or infraction appeared, usually not lis- tening, and it was followed by the explicit teaching of a rule or code of conduct. The socialization of listening naturally segued into a description of the sociali- zation of speaking. Listening was firmly established as a prerequisite for speak- ing, as was standing using the appropriate speaking posture. Yet, the most ex- plicit socialization of speaking related to the use of particular grammatical frames to connect one's talk to a prior student's talk. These grammatical frames were presented in both oral and written form. After they were written out, the children were held accountable for their use. The students who did not use these frames lost their turns to talk. The students who did use these frames were scaf- folded to produce a rich elaboration of their initial contributions to the class dis- cussion.

Every culture utilizes and views silence differently. This thesis examines the use of silence in the speech act of asking and answering questions, in two dif- ferent speech events by a small group of Japanese learners of conversational English in Matsuyama, Japan. Data for this study were collected within an eth- nographic framework (Muriel Saville-Troike, 2003), utilizing participant ob- servations, interviews, questionnaires, and audio and digital video recordings of both events. The focus is a comparison of the use of silence, and the body lan- guage in those periods of silence, to determine the degree of sociolinguistic transference with this particular speech community. Specifically, long periods of silence were incorporated in most participants' speech acts and, generally, silent periods were longer in the L2 than the L1. In addition, during these periods of silence, it was observed that age, gender and status influenced the body language 261</page><page sequence="32">Japanese Language and Literature used by this small groups of learners in the L1 and L2 speech events.

Along with the advancement of the Internet, the use of the World Wide Web in foreign language teaching and learning has been explored and practiced by many language education professionals in the field. How best to use the tech- nology to facilitate foreign language teaching and learning largely depends on a thorough understanding of the technology and on solid learning theory. The use of the web in foreign language education so far has been mainly in three areas: source of authentic materials, means of communication, and instruction delivery. The first two applications have been extensively explored and studied, whereas the third application has been less studied in part because of the newness of the web technology. This thesis explores and discusses the issue of interactivity in the web-based development of foreign language learning materials. It achieves its goal through an examination of currently available interactive technology in connection with its applicability in foreign language teaching and learning with real world exam- ples. It looks at the possibilities of web interactivity in foreign language teaching and learning. Using the ATLAS Japanese Project as a showcase, the thesis illus- trates how web-based interactive technologies can be implemented in practice, and provides guidelines based on an interactionist perspective from second lan- guage acquisition research. More specifically, it uses a sample unit in the Japa- nese Language Project to demonstrate how the principles of second language acquisition can be used as guidelines in web-based materials development and how human-computer interaction can be realized in online language learning ac- tivities. The thesis discusses the strengths and limitations of web-based interactivity in foreign language teaching and learning, and suggestions are provided for teach- ers who are interested in designing and developing web-based materials. The goal is to inform those who want to develop web-based language learning mater- ials of both the potential and the limitations of current web-based interactive technology.

State University of New York at Buffalo [United States], 2006 (Ph.D. in Lin- guistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Robert D. Van Valin, Jr. viii, 246p. DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 4368-A; UM 3203965. The patterns of association that are found between forms and meanings in lan- guage are not inevitable since the same meaning can be represented by different forms in different languages. It does not mean, however, that they are com- pletely random; instead, there often are some motivations for a certain form to have a certain meaning, and their associations can be accounted for from a func- tional perspective. This dissertation deals with a rich variety of numeral quanti- fier (NQ) constructions in Japanese and investigates the association patterns be- tween the formal properties of those NQ constructions on one hand and their meanings and discourse functions on the other hand through a comparative analysis of the meanings and discourse functions of those constructions. The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter One shows that NQ consists of a numeral and a classifier, both of which have some subtypes, and introduces a total of ten NQ constructions that I deal with in this study. Chapters Two, Three and Four analyze the discourse functions of the three major NQ construc- tions, namely the Prenominal NQ construction (Pre-N), the Juxtaposed NQ con- struction (JX), and the Floating NQ construction (FL), and discuss their func- tional relationships among their intra-constructional variations as well as the functional relationships with other NQ constructions that are structurally rele- vant to them. I also discuss the constraints on quantifier-float and propose that the constraints are multi-layered in syntax, semantics, and pragmatics respec- tively. Chapter Five discusses the inter-constructional relationships of the three NQ constructions in terms of the cognitive representation of quantification and compares their discourse functions in regard to the collectiveness of the denoted entities, the scope of NQ, and the distribution patterns in text data. Chapter Six presents the formal representations of the functional differences of the NQ con- structions using the Role and Reference Grammar framework. This study shows 263</page><page sequence="34">Japanese Language and Literature that the NQ constructions in Japanese have non-arbitrary association patterns be- tween their forms and meanings to a great extent and that the differences in their structural properties are clearly reflected in the differences in their meanings and discourse functions.

Geminate Weight: Case Studies and Formal Models. University of Washington [United States], 2003 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Sharon L. Hargus. 3, ix, 340p. DAI 64, no.11 (May 2004): 4028-A; UM 3111056. This dissertation examines data from Japanese and fifteen other languages with geminates and compares leading models of geminates and syllable weight to determine the most cross-linguistically predictive and explanatory model of geminate length. On the common assumption that segmental length is prosodic, its representation depends on the syllable model that is espoused and that is eventually determined to be adequate in accounting for cross-linguistic patterns. I compare four syllable models corresponding to two basic models of geminates, a skeletal model and a moraic model, with patterns of geminate distribution and weight in a variety of languages and weight-sensitive phenomena (including stress, minimality, metrics, compensatory lengthening, reduplication and lan- guage games). Many of the languages or patterns have arisen in the literature, but are reanalyzed here in the context of understanding each weight system as a whole and of clarifying the implications of the data and of the competing sylla- ble models. All four syllable models compared are ultimately inadequate to account for the attested patterns. While a moraic model of syllable weight predicts and mod- els attested patterns most successfully, the moraic model of geminates as in- herently weight-bearing is an insufficient definition of geminates because it fails to distinguish geminates from weight-bearing singleton consonants in some cases. I argue that the representational distinction between geminates and single- tons is not one of X-slots in a skeletal or composite syllable model (as pre- viously proposed), but one of root nodes, similar to that proposed by Elisabeth Selkirk (1990). This model of geminates entails a revised syllable model, re- sembling the moraic and composite models, but with important distinctions. This syllable model makes predictions that must be further examined; some are supported by recent findings. This investigation into the representation of geminates concerns many sub- fields of phonology that also individually merit cross-linguistic studies. The rep- resentations examined are fundamental to defining the prosodic units to be util- ized in a constraint based approach and in defining input and output forms that 264</page><page sequence="35">Abstracts are evaluated in that approach. This study also provides data-driven analyses of the weight systems of the sixteen languages, and pinpoints patterns that are (and are not) crucial in comparing weight models.

The Common Loanwords in Japanese Based on High-Frequency English Vocabulary and Their Effect on Language Ac- quisition. Victoria University of Wellington [New Zealand], 2004 (Ph.D. in Lin- guistics and Applied Language Studies: Applied Linguistics). ChairpersonMajor Adviser: Paul Nation. xii, 312p. No published abstract. Contact the library of Victoria University of Wellington for information regarding the availability of copies (call number Central Theses AS741 VUW PhD TLinA 24). This dissertation examines the nature of the high-frequency English words that have been adopted into Japanese and their effect upon L2 English vocabu- lary acquisition. The findings include: (a) High-frequency English vocabulary is of great use to learners in an L2 situation, as it provides good coverage of even unsimplified texts. (b) It appears that just 2,000 to 3,000 word families provide adequate coverage of general, unsimplified texts. (c) The BNC 3000 (Nation, forthcoming), a frequency list based on the British National Corpus, is an ap- propriate frequency list on which to base other research. (d) Although loan words are widespread and deeply integrated into Japanese, questions remain re- garding their comprehensibility to Japanese. (e) The "paradox of cognates" that cognates appear both to hinder and aid language acquisition-can be re- solved by seeing the role of transfer errors from a developmental perspective. Regardless of semantic overlap, formal similarities between L1 and L2 provide a "lexical peg" which tends to propel acquisition forward. (f) There is substantial empirical evidence that English loanwords in Japanese assist the acquisition of their related borrowed words in English. Moreover, loanwords were found in disproportionate numbers in learner production. (g) A thorough examination of the comprehensibility of two dictionaries [Motwani and Kamiya] of "common" loanwords showed that researchers needing a fairly complete listing of today's common gairaigo cannot depend upon a single source of data. (h) Daulton's (1998) findings concerning the overlap between common loanwords in Japanese and high-frequency English vocabulary are unreliable because of the lack of validity in his list of loanwords. (i) While there is a profusion of everyday loan- words in the Japanese media, there likewise is a large number of poorly under- 265</page><page sequence="36">Japanese Language and Literature stood items. Among them can be found various nonce borrowings and idiosyn- cratic usages, which are a propelling force in the growing lexicon. (j) Using four types of lexical data including a newspaper corpus, it was found that 45.3 per- cent of BNC 3000 word families correspond to loanwords whose comprehensi- bility was confirmed with Japanese university students. (k) Japanese learners are able to generalize their cognate-based knowledge of a word family member to the other inflected forms and derivations present in the word family. This val- idates the utility of high-frequency words. (1) Most of the correspondences between high-frequency English and common loanwords appear to be of high quality. Accordingly, a very useful "built-in lexicon" of useful cognates for high- frequency English vocabulary appears to exist in the Japanese lexicon.

In recent decades, the major pragmatic frameworks-notably Gricean Max- ims, Searle's Speech act theory, and Brown and Levinson's politeness theory- have often been problematically interpreted as "universal" principles in much of the pragmatic literature. Some of these theories are postulated on the basis of a 266</page><page sequence="37">Abstracts speaker's rational contribution to the communication in English-speaking speech communities, and ignore contextual factors and cultural value systems. Conse- quently, some researchers have cast doubt upon their applicability to non-Anglo, particularly non-European, speech communities. Following Ide's (e.g., 1989, 1998) argument against the universality of these frameworks, this thesis dis- cusses the organization of the Japanese linguistic politeness system. It focuses on the pragmatic functions of modality and the pragmatic and semantic restric- tions that the notion of territory of information imposes on the language. It also raises the question of the learnability of these factors for English-speaking learn- ers of Japanese. [Abstract at the beginning of Ebata's thesis]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2.

This dissertation explores the issue of language transfer in the acquisition of Japanese as a third or greater language at the university level. The term "L &gt; 3" was adopted to describe the acquisition of a language or languages beyond a second language or first foreign language. The following research questions were investigated: (a) What is/are the major source(s) of language transfer in the acquisition of Japanese as an L &gt; 3? (b) What are the roles of sociolinguistic transfer and sociolinguistic competence in the acquisition of Japanese as an L &gt; 3? (c) How do L2 proficiency, prior language learning experience, and residence in Japan affect sociolinguistic transfer and sociolinguistic competence in the ac- quisition of Japanese as an L &gt; 3? (d) What is the relevance of L &gt; 3 acquisition research for general second lan- guage acquisition theory development? To investigate the above research questions, twenty-four third-year learners of Japanese at the University of Sydney and ten native-speaker informants who were living in Sydney volunteered as subjects for this study. The learners came from a variety of first and second language backgrounds, but all had followed the same course of study at university, which began at the ab initio level in the first year. Of the twenty-four learners, twenty-one were learning Japanese as an 267</page><page sequence="38">Japanese Language and Literature L &gt;3; three were learning it as a first foreign language. The following data elici- tation instruments were used: C-test, DCT (Discourse Completion Task), DET (Discourse Evaluation Task), SWT (Short Writing Task), and a Language Learning Background Questionnaire. The C-test was used to evaluate overall language proficiency, whereas the DCT, the DET, and the SWT were designed to elicit data on learner sociolinguistic competence through speech art realisation tasks. Data gathered from the above instruments were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively in an attempt to discern possible sources of transfer and other factors that influence sociolinguistic competence. An opportunity for written in- trospection was included in the DCT, the DET, and the SWT to gather addi- tional information on reasons for responses and on metalinguistic notions. Results from the study showed that one's first language had the most influence on learner performance because no learners had learned a second language that was closer to Japanese typologically than their first language. Native speakers of Chinese and Korean performed better in lexical areas because of the large Chinese-character-based lexicon in Chinese, Japanese and Korean, but overall, native-speakers of English ranked second after Korean learners in language proficiency. These findings are limited, however, because there were only two native speakers of Korean in the data sample. With regard to sociolinguistic competence and transfer, the dissertation showed that learners were aware of different speech levels in Japanese and the need to use honorifics in certain situ- ations, but that they did not use the informal register in situations that would or- dinarily have called for it. This suggests that instruction in the use of the in- formal register may not have been sufficient. Finally, the study showed that the C-test is a valid measure of Japanese proficiency and that the HDI (Honorary Density Index) is useful for providing a quantitative measure of honorific use in different speech act frames.

In some languages, a subset of the lexicon is exempt from generalizations that hold over the rest of the lexicon. Usually, the words that make up this excep- tional class are loanwords from a foreign language. This dissertation argues that such a partitioning of the lexicon more or less according to the historical origins of words is psychologically real to native speakers and should be considered part of Universal Grammar. I conducted a series of experiments using speakers of Japanese, English, and Latvian to show that speakers use knowledge of the strat- ification of their languages to resolve ambiguities in the sound signal. I found 268</page><page sequence="39">Abstracts some evidence to suggest that speakers interpret certain marked speech sounds as a sign of foreignness and also that speakers are aware of the foreign origin of some unmarked words. I argue that information concerning the source of unmarked foreign words can only come from non-grammatical sources. Once supplied with this information, however, the grammar can account for perceptual bias, as well as classify marked words into their respective lexical strata. These results can be obtained by combining several already existing proposals that have been made recently within the Optimality Theory framework.

This thesis is a study of the productivity of rules for the past tense [-ta] verbal inflection in Japanese. It addresses a puzzle that arose in earlier work by Timothy Vance (1987), namely the apparent inability of many native speakers of Japanese to conjugate novel verbs using the very productive inflectional patterns found in their language. The primary data used in this study consist of the responses of fourteen native speakers of Japanese on a rigorously designed computer-based test of nonce verbs. Our analysis is based on the fact that the verbal inflection of native Japanese verbs is transparent and predictable, as is demonstrated, and therefore should be productive for native speakers of Japanese as similar productive rules are for na- tive speakers of other languages. Our results, however, indicate that only a small minority of the native speak- ers of Japanese are consistently able to apply the phonological rules of the past tense conjugation. Indeed, it appears that the privileged group of speakers who provide "correct" conjugations of novel forms are not using their natural lin- guistic intuitions in doing so, but instead are following a conscious, analytical 269</page><page sequence="40">Japanese Language and Literature strategy; suggesting that for the majority, rote memory plays a more significant role in the acquisition of verbal inflection than do the productive rules of the lan- guage.

University of Hawaii at Manoa [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures: Japanese). Chairperson/ Major Adviser: Haruko M. Cook. xiv, 177p. DAI 66, no.4 (Oct. 2005): 1339-A; UM 3171050. Literality in interpersonal communication has been discussed in language phi- losophy as well as in psycholinguistics, in which the relationship between what is actually uttered and what is intended has been an issue. The gap between them can be explained in two different ways: one is the conventionality of language use and the other is through inference based on the literal meaning. These two explanations contrast in such a way that the former does not assume that the literal meaning of the utterance necessarily contributes to the generation of its intended meaning, whereas the latter treats the literal meaning as the basis of the inference. Theoretically speaking, it may be possible to categorize non-literal ut- terances into roughly two types: conventional utterances and non-conventional utterances. For the latter type, if the gap between what is uttered and what is communicated is perceived as small, it can be considered that the utterance is more literal. The present study examined how both native Japanese speakers and learners of Japanese, who are native speakers of American English, perceive three types of utterances, literal utterances (e.g., Kyoo wa shokuji o gochisooshite-itadaite, doomo arigatoo gozaimashita), non-literal non-conventional utterances (e.g., Kondo baito-dai haittara, watashi ga gochisoo shimasu ne), and non-literal conventional utterances (e.g., Gochisoo sama deshita), using a set of multiple- choice questionnaires asking the participants to choose the most likely interpre- tation of the utterance. Two groups of university students, sixty native speakers of Japanese and sixty native speakers of American English, who had completed two-years of formal Japanese instruction, participated in the study. The effect of the language groups, L1 and L2, was statistically significant (p &lt;.0001) and the interaction between the utterance types and language groups was also significant (p = .0052), while the effect of utterance types was not sig- nificant (p = .2911). The most obvious difference between native and non-native speakers of Japanese was found when they interpreted non-literal conventional utterances, while the difference was the smallest for literal utterances. These findings suggest that non-native speakers of Japanese are more likely to fail to 270</page><page sequence="41">Abstracts comprehend conventionally used indirect utterances that native speakers use fre- quently in daily communication.

University of Delaware [United States], 2006 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Satoshi Tomioka. xii, 188p. DAI 67, no.l (July 2006): 200-A; UM 3205429. It has been widely assumed that pragmatics is independent of the computation of syntax and semantics. There is now a movement, however, in the direction that at least some pragmatic effects should be analyzed in semantics. Some lexi- cal items have been identified as being closely tied to implicatures. Furthermore, language has the linguistic means to indicate the nature of evidence for an ut- tered statement, evidentiality. The existence of these items raises the question of where exactly is the boundary of semantics and pragmatics. Japanese has a rich paradigm of morphological manifestation of implicatures and evidentiality, which also has a rigid syntax. By investigating Japanese discourse items which give rise to pragmatic effects, this dissertation sheds new light on the issue of how these pragmatic notions are represented in language. Contrastive-marking is analyzed as an indication of lexically specified Gric- ean implicature. Adopting Philippe Schlenker's (2003) notion of "shiftable in- dexicals", I argue that Contrastive-marking also contains a shiftable indexical because the implicature associated with Contrastive-marking can be relativized to an attitude-holder other than the actual speaker of the sentence. This associa- tion between the implicature and the attitude-holder cannot be established in cer- tain constructions, adjunct clauses and relative clauses. Hence, I argue that the computation of Contrastive-marking involves an island-sensitive movement of an operator. I also present a parallelism between Contrastive-marking and Evidential- marking with respect to the distribution among adjunct clauses. I take this fact to show that both Contrastive-marking and Evidential-marking express some atti- tude towards a closed proposition, following Michael Johnston's (1994) analysis that the semantics of temporal and if-clauses involve an event quantification, while that of because-clauses is a relation between two particular events. Fur- thermore, I argue that because-operator and evidential-marking are context- shifters that can bind shiftable indexicals. 271</page><page sequence="42">Japanese Language and Literature Towards the end of the dissertation, I present an analysis of a particular dis- course item darou as an evidential marker that has a modal flavor, which indi- cates the speaker's bias towards the embedded proposition and indicates that the bias is based on non-observable reasoning on the part of the speaker. The data also toss a question into the discussion of levels of meaning to which discourse items commit. [Abstract on pages xi-xii ofHara's dissertation]. Contents: 1. Background and Overview. 2.

HASHIMOTO, Yuria (1977-). Involvement of "Zero Expressions" in Topic Transitions in Japanese Spoken Discourse.

This thesis analyzes a phenomenon in Japanese spoken discourse that is mostly known by the term "ellipsis". Behind this term, there is the assumption of an "underlying full syntactic structure" required by the core grammar of the language, from which it is "derived" or "deviated". This study takes a different position and chooses to call the phenomenon "zero expression", meaning that it is a full-fledged, not a deviated, form of reference in an utterance that implicitly indicates semantically/pragmatically crucial information for the interlocutors to interpret the whole utterance. Based on the above perspective, the present study focuses on the involvement of zero expressions in discourse topic transitions in spontaneous multi-party conversations. More specifically, it challenges a common argument in the lit- erature that they mark topic continuity but seldom cross a topic boundary. By examining the data, this thesis contends that zero expressions appear at topic transitions quite frequently in spontaneous conversations among intimate indi- viduals, primarily because there is a high possibility that they (a) share the knowledge of the dominant "theme" of their conversation and/or (b) exploit the resources of the local environment. This thesis further claims that the distinction between zero expression and some other types of reference seen in the data is not as clear-cut when investi- gated from both the syntactic and semantic-pragmatic points of view. The study suggests that the various means of reference in Japanese including zero expres- sion may not be well-explicable by the common linguistic assumption of "core grammar" or "syntactically obligatory elements".

Even though the notions of politeness and implicature are key concepts in the field of pragmatics, the intersection between them has received only minimal attention. This thesis investigates their relationship-in particular, the way in which implicatures give rise to politeness, the term "politeness implicature" be- ing used to refer to this phenomenon. I propose a metalinguistic approach for this analysis. The purpose of the metalanguage is to provide a set of tools for an- alyzing and explicating politeness implicature in Japanese and to enable compar- isons to be made with such other languages as English. Since metalanguages up to now have primarily been constructed in semantic research, this study repre- sents one of the first attempts to utilize a metalinguistic approach in analyzing pragmatic phenomena (such as politeness implicature). Building upon a review of key literature on politeness and implicature, the notion of politeness implica- ture is defined as something else implied in addition to what is literally said, which shows that the speaker thinks well of others or does not think too highly of himself or herself. I discuss the different ways in which implying may gen- erate politeness, using examples of politeness implicature gathered from a vari- ety of different sources in Japanese. A number of phenomena closely related to politeness implicature also emerge from this discussion. They draw attention to areas that will require further investigation if a comprehensive theory of polite- ness implicature is to be constructed. While politeness implicatures are indeed a complex phenomenon, the metalinguisitic approach employed in deconstructing examples of them demonstrates that they can still be explained, to some extent at least, in fairly simple terms.

This thesis set out to analyze loanwords in Japanese, primarily from English, that are found in material oriented towards specific generations. Many previous studies have also paid attention to the use of loanwords in Japanese. For ex- ample, Kyoko Takashi (1990) analyzes borrowings from English in Japanese advertising texts, while Iwasaki (1994) examines the use of borrowings from English in newspaper editorials. Few studies, however, have paid attention to generational differences of borrowings. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to examine variations in the quality and quantity of the loanwords that appear across generations in Japanese. For the analyses, both linguistic theories (such as phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics) and social and psycho- logical factors are taken into account. One of the more controversial issues- borrowing, Code-Mixing and Code-Switching-is discussed for a better under- standing of borrowings in Japanese. The targeted domain of this study is restricted to female fashion articles, since the high frequency of loanwords that are observed may be most appropriate to identifying generational differences. The study draws its data from five of the most widely distributed Japanese magazines, which target five different gener- ations: teenagers, twenty-year-olds, thirty-year-olds, forty-year-olds, and fifty- and sixty-year olds. The present study produced two major findings. First, while a great number of loanwords are used among all age groups, different types of borrowing behav- iors are observed among generations. Second, the data from borrowings in Japa- nese have also provided new notions to the controversy of borrowing, Code- 274</page><page sequence="45">Abstracts Mixing and Code-Switching.

Prosody and LF Interpretation: Processing Japanese Wh-Questions. Univer- sity of Massachusetts at Amherst [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Lyn Frazier. xxiv, 469p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2192-A; UM 3179881. This dissertation investigates how prosodic phrasing influences listeners' interpretation of scopally ambiguous wh-questions in Japanese. It focuses on sentences such as that in (1), in which the wh-phrase can take either embedded or matrix scope: (1) [CP [IP John-wa [CP Mary-ga nani-o katta-ka] kikimasita]-ka] John-TOP Mary-NOM what-ACC bought-Q asked-Q 'Did John ask what Mary bought?' (Embedded scope) or 'What did John ask whether Mary bought?' (Matrix scope) I argue that the comprehension of the wh-phrase is guided by the prosodic phrasing of the sentence, as specified in the Scope Prosody Correspondence in (2): (2) Scope Prosody Correspondence (SPC). The scope of a term X should not extend beyond the Major (phonological) Phrase (MaP) containing X. The SPC predicts that there is a strong bias for an embedded scope interpretation when a MaP boundary appears after the embedded Q-marker in (1). Without such a prosodic boundary, the SPC predicts that both embedded and matrix scope interpretations are equally available. The results of off-line comprehen- sion experiments supported these predictions of the SPC. They also indicated that prosodic phrasing rather than pitch compression is the primary determinant of listeners' scope assignments. In addition, it was shown that an embedded scope interpretation was induced by the prosodic boundary at the embedded Q- marker, not by the focus interpretation of the matrix verb. Further experiments showed that the SPC also applies to unambiguous wh- questions and to other sentences that contain negative polarity items or quanti- fiers (e.g., interaction between negation and negative polarity sika, relative scope of quantifiers), but not to sentences that lack scope-relevant items. These results suggest that the SPC is not a construction specific principle effective only in wh- questions but rather a general principle that listeners use when they process sen- tences containing all and only scope relevant items. Finally, speakers of Tokyo Japanese sometimes inserted a MaP boundary after 275</page><page sequence="46">Japanese Language and Literature the embedded Q-marker, and sometimes did not, for both scope interpretations of the wh-phrase. In contrast to the comprehension results, in production, the presence of a prosodic boundary after the embedded Q-marker was not reserved for embedded questions except when the two structures were explicitly com- pared.

This thesis evaluates models of adult second language acquisition (L2A) with respect to the availability of principles and parameters of Universal Grammar (UG) in "Poverty-of-the-Stimulus" (POS) situations. It reports on an empirical study of the acquisition of word order optionality in L2 German by native speak- ers of English and Japanese. Following a review of the rationale and results of previous research on POS phenomena in L2A, we develop a theoretical account of word order optionality in German, Japanese and English within the framework of the Minimalist Pro- gram (Chomsky, 1995). Specifically, we discuss remnant movement, i.e., incom- plete category fronting across a previously extracted phrase as in (1): (1) [A...ti...]j...Bi...tj A universal constraint (Unambiguous Domination (UD), Moller 1996), which is reducible to the (Minimalist) UG-principle, Attract F, prohibits such remnant movement constellations if both movements are of the same type. Notably, evi- dence for UD exists only in the context of interacting types of A-bar movement, e.g., scrambling and topicalization in German and Japanese. English disallows scrambling, and the operation of UD for German is underdetermined in the in- put. By contrast, UD constrains scrambling in Japanese; yet, unlike German, Japanese allows scrambling across finite clause boundaries ....

In both of these constructions, an NP within the embedded clause is interpreted as an argument of the matrix clause. There are two major goals in this dissertation. The first is to provide a unified syntactic and semantic analysis of the CENP and IHRC constructions. I argue that the CENP construction is basically the same as the IHRC construction, even though some previous researchers have assumed the contrary (Kuroda 1992, 1999, Ohara 1996, Shimoyama 1999, among others). Furthermore, I argue that both the CENP NP and the MC NP are arguments of the matrix verbs. My second goal is to closely examine the syntactic and semantic properties of the CENP construction and the IHRC construction. As discussed by Hoshi (1995) and Shimoyama (1999), the interpretation of the argument which is "modified by the IHRC" in these constructions is quite similar to that of E-type pronouns (Evans 1977, 1980). In addition, there are some facts that show that the event of the embedded clause is linguistically connected to the event of the matrix clause. Regarding all these properties, the CENP construction behaves in the same manner as the IHRC construction. Adapting the E-type pronoun analy- ses of the IHRC (Hoshi 1995 and Shimoyama 1999), I propose an alternative analysis of the CENP construction and the IHRC construction to capture those properties. Moreover, even though the CENP construction and the IHRC construction share many properties with each other, there are some differences between them (Shimoyama 1999, among others). In particular, the CENP cannot appear as the subject of the matrix clause, whereas the IHRC can. However, we observe re- strictions on possible internal heads with regard to the subject IHRC, in contrast to the CENP. I try to account for those differences under a unified analysis of the 277</page><page sequence="48">Japanese Language and Literature CENP construction and the IHRC construction, together with an analysis of the subject MC, which adapts Shimoyama's (1999) analysis of the IHRC.

University of Oregon [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Noriko Fujii and Susan G. Guion. xiii, 171p. DAI 67, no.l (July 2006): 171-A; UM 3201683. This dissertation investigates the Japanese singleton vs. geminate stop contrast (e.g., t vs. tt) in order to explore potentially invariant perceptual cues signaling this contrast in the continuously varying acoustic signal. Previous studies have shown that temporal properties of sounds are heavily influenced by changes in speech rate such that the durations of members of two contrasting categories can be overlapping. Given this, questions arise as to how category distinction is achieved for contrasts signaled by differences in the temporal domain. This study examines the singleton and geminate stop contrast in Japanese, using the tenets central to the general auditory approach (e.g., Diehl, Lotto, and Holt, 2004). The specific proposals examined are that (a) there are covarying, multiple acoustic characteristics that redundantly distinguish the two Japanese stop types, and (b) there exists a higher-order relational measure that invariantly distinguishes the two categories amidst a variable signal. In the first acoustic experiment, the segmental durations of the stop conso- nants, as well as the fundamental frequency (tO), amplitude and phonation qual- ity of the surrounding vowels are measured in order to investigate possible co- variation of these features with the singleton vs. geminate contrast. In the second acoustic experiment, a number of relational timings between the closure dura- tion and other segment(s) are assessed as rate-independent measures distinguish- ing the two stop types. In the final experiment, perceptual relevance of the key relational timings is examined. The results suggest that acoustic correlates to the singleton vs. geminate contrast indeed covary: Preceding mora duration, follow- ing vowel duration, f, and amplitude are all found to be related to the contrast. The results also suggest that there are higher-order relational measures serving as rate-independent cues for the contrast: The ratios of stop closure to the pre- ceding mora as well as stop closure to the following vowel are found to be stable across speaking rates and to be accurate in classifying naturally-produced to- 278</page><page sequence="49">Abstracts kens. The listeners' response patterns show an influential role of preceding mora duration and a small role of following vowel duration. The results also suggest that non-durational factor(s) influence the perception of the singleton vs. gem- inate stops. [Abstract on pages iv-v of Idemaru's dissertation]. Contents: 1.

Unlike English, Japanese does not stress syllables, reduce vowel sounds, or end with consonants (except /n/). The present study investigated the influence of Japanese speakers' first language interference, relatable to those characteristics of Japanese, on their pronunciation of English, and the effects of form-focused instructions on (a) reduction of unstressed vowels, (b) stress placement, and (c) production of final consonant sounds. Ten advanced adult Japanese learners of English were divided into two groups: the experimental group, which received training for thirty minutes twice a week for six weeks, and the control group, which did not receive any treatment. Both groups took the pre- and the post- tests, which were evaluated by five raters according to different tasks and skills. The results showed that the experimental group made greater progress than the control group at the post-test, not only in those three areas, but also in overall pronunciation.

Master's Abstracts International 43, no.3 (June 2005): 678; UM 1423803. In traditional Japanese grammar, desu is translated and taught as a copula-be in English. This, however, does not completely account for the nature of the word desu from a theoretic syntactic point of view. The Japanese language has syntactic markings for politeness, and various forms of the word desu itself in- clude the meaning of politeness. For example, the word da is used as a [-polite] 279</page><page sequence="50">Japanese Language and Literature marker and desu is used as a [+polite] marker in sentences that have adjectives as predicates, while da [-polite] or desu [+polite] bear tense as in datta and desita respectively. Therefore, desu cannot be simply treated as a copula like "be". Desu clearly undergoes various transformations. This work focuses on and attempts to explain the purposes and transformations involved with desu struc- tures in Japanese along with tree-diagrams and counterpart structures of English. Contents: 1.

Among the multiple and diverse meanings and functions of passive construc- tions, this study considers that the primary function of passives in Japanese is to portray an event from the point of view of an affected entity. The dissertation identifies three types of affectedness in Japanese passive constructions: emotive affectedness, direct/physical affectedness, and objective affectedness. Emotive affectedness, often referred to as "adversative" meaning, has drawn the attention of many researchers. It has been strongly associated in the past with the syn- tactic category called the "indirect passive", but it is actually also observed in many instances of the "direct passive". Direct/physical affectedness is detected mainly in the construction that is here referred to as the "direct sentient passive". This meaning is common in passives in many other languages, including Eng- lish. The last type-objective affectedness-is primarily associated with "non- sentient passives", more specifically with what is here called the "plain passive". Many previous researchers have claimed a complete and apparently transpar- ent correlation between syntactic and semantic distinctions of the Japanese pas- sive. The present study rejects these direct correlations. In the course of analyz- ing authentic data, it becomes evident that the correlation is much more subtle than has generally been recognized, and that it is a matter of degree or contin- uum, rather than a discrete, black and white issue. To reflect this view, this study proposes separate sets of categories for syntactic and semantic distinctions. The ultimate aim of this dissertation is to reveal how Japanese passives are actually used in real contexts. For this purpose, a detailed examination of au- thentic written and spoken data is conducted. Some findings of the data analysis contradict previous claims, such as the finding of a large proportion of passives 280</page><page sequence="51">Abstracts with a non-sentient subject and very low frequency of occurrence of indirect passives. This research also finds that, although more than half of the propositional meanings in the passive data examined are "negative", a considerable number of passives still appear in a proposition with a neutral or positive meaning. Another prominent finding regarding propositional meaning is that it seems to be related to the degree of centrality of the passive subject to the event. With regard to the syntactic classification of passive, in particular, it is observed that the lower the degree of the centrality of the subject of the passive to the event, the greater the likelihood that the passive clause involves a negative proposition.

The science of translation is informed by a diverse range of theoretical mod- els. These models typically address linguistic aspects in the translation process and less often cultural aspects. To investigate the process of translation, it is use- ful to model translation in a variety of ways. For example, translation can be classified into types; it can also be considered in terms of translation equiva- lence, transference and translatability as well as in terms of linguistic and cul- tural considerations. The extent to which this modeling in fact informs the prac- tice of translation, however, is debatable. The aim of this thesis is two fold. First, it contributes to the debate on the extent to which theory informs practice, and second, it compares two transla- tions from English into Japanese as a means of illustrating how the translator renders different versions depending on intention. The method of this study involves the translation of the Australian novel, My Place, by Sally Morgan (born in 1951). First, the translation was conducted without reference to translation theory. Second, having read and considered the body of work on translation, the difficulties I faced in the process of translating My Place were then reassessed in theoretical terms in order to assist in under- standing why difficulties in fact arose. Finally, an alternative translation of My 281</page><page sequence="52">Japanese Language and Literature Place by Kato Megumi was read and the similarities and differences with Kaji- kawa's translation were noted. The results of this study indicate that translation theory only partially informs translation practice due to a lack of incorporation of SL cultural consideration into the models. These, if they are present, are usually as secondary considera- tions following linguistic ones. This consequently reduces the usefulness of the- ory in practice, especially when translating a literary work such as My Place. Furthermore, the comparison of the two translations reveals the different inten- tions of the translators. The Kajikawa version reveals a TL version which pre- serves the cultural color and contexts of the original with some loss of reada- bility, while the Kato version maintains readability with the loss of SL cultural accuracy. In other words, Kajikawa is truer to the original while Kato is truer to the TL readership. [Abstract on pages ii-iii of Kajikawa's thesis]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Types of Translation. 3.

Contact the University Library, University of Surrey (George Edwards Building, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, United Kingdom) for in- formation regarding the availability of copies (catalogue control number M0001654SR). This thesis discusses the cognitive development of 3- 2 to 5 year old simul- taneous Japanese-English bilinguals relative to that of English and Japanese monolinguals in the same age group. The specific area of cognitive development tested is the ability to separate word meaning from form and to recognize the arbitrariness of language. The research is based on a similar study by Anita Ianco-Worrall (1970) using English-Afrikaans bilinguals in a bilingual society in South Africa. There are two major differences between the present research and Ianco-Worrall's: one is that the Japanese-English bilinguals reside in the United States, where Japanese is a minority language; the second is that there is no common linguistic foundation between Japanese and English. Nevertheless, the Japanese-English bilinguals demonstrated an advanced awareness of the separation of a referent from its object, or the recognition of the arbitrary as- signment of the word while the function of the object itself remains the same. Although the result is somewhat different from that of lanco-Worrall, it is a positive indication of the degree to which simultaneous bilinguals in an additive situation can maintain their linguality even if one language is considered a mi- 282</page><page sequence="53">Abstracts nority language in the majority environment.

The study of casual speech, along with that of children's language acquisition, dialects and aphasia, can provide data of considerable significance in identifying the marked segments and structures of languages. Yet few attempts have been made to model formally variation between formal and casual speech. Japanese, for instance, displays a variety of contracting processes in casual speech but, as far as I am aware, no one has ever formalized the grammar underlying casual speech in this language. This dissertation is an attempt to shed light on this un- derdeveloped area of study. By closely examining a wide range of phonological processes observed in casual Japanese speech, I aim to formalize its grammar within the Framework of Optimality Theory (John McCarthy and Alan Prince, 1993; Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky, 1993), with particular focus on one of its branches, Correspondence Theory (John McCarthy and Alan Prince, 1995). In this dissertation, the grammar of casual speech is formalized by means of constraint reranking. To this end. the hierarchy of constraints for formal Japa- nese speech is first established through the analysis of consonant alternatives and the formation of the te-form of verbs, which more or less corresponds to the English present participle. My close examination of casual speech processes found that the shift from formal speech to causal speech merely involves the demotion of two constraints, namely MAX-V-IO and MAC-C-IO, and that casual speech contraction can mostly be ascribed to the interaction of ONSET, *LAB and *r. The latter two, therefore, are considered to be marked in Japanese. I also found that only closed-class items are targeted by most of the processes. This clearly indicates that the distinction between open class and closed class is a cornerstone of the formal-casual contrast in Japanese phonology. [Abstract on page vii of Kawai's dissertation].

Contact Trinity College Library (College Street, Dublin 2, Ireland) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number Thesis 6141). This thesis explores ingo, the name given to Japanese secret languages. My main objective is to examine the word formation strategies used in lexical innovation in ingo by investigating both the morpho-phonological and non- morphological word formation processes. The lexicon of the ingo discussed in this thesis is an amalgam of original data collected during the time that I spent in Japan and data collected from Japanese historical records or dictionaries. I con- duct a comparative analysis of the word formation processes employed in ingo and the word formation processes used in standard Japanese, and examine the strategies that are unique to either ingo or the standard language. From this analysis, I conclude that the morphological word formation processes common to both ingo and standard Japanese are prefixation, suffixation, truncation, acro- nyms, compounding and portmanteau blending. The non-morphological word formation processes shared by both are the revival of classical vocabulary, the modernisation of readings, Japanese coinage of Sino-Japanese vocabulary, bor- rowings from dialects, foreign languages and other sociolects, metaphorical ex- tension, the use of proper and generic nouns, word play and descriptive circum- location. Strategies that are common to both ingo and standard Japanese but differ in their application are reduplication and conversion. Processes that are unique to standard Japanese and are not featured in ingo are the use of earlier Chinese translations and the use of ateji or phonetic substitution. Infixation, transposition, word initial truncation, antonyms and orthographical references are all word formation processes unique to ingo and are not featured in standard Japanese. I also examine the interaction between the morphology and phonology of ingo and discuss the implication which this has for phonological theory. By demon- strating that morae play an important role in deriving lexical items, and by showing that many lexical processes are subject to morphological constraints, I conclude that the mora is an indispensable notion for the description of Japanese ingo.

University of Michigan [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairper- son/Major Adviser: Acrisio M. Pires and Marilyn J. Shatz. xiii, 155p. DAI 66, no.10 (Apr. 2006): 3626-A; UM 3192678. The goal of this dissertation is to illuminate the core aspects of the observed and potential causative/passive ambiguities regarding Korean -/-, Japanese - (s)ase- and -(r)are- and English have-en. Although the ambiguity between a causative interpretation and a passive interpretation of a structure has been ob- served in many languages, the factors that constrain both the existence and the kinds of causative/passive ambiguities have not been fully investigated. In order to fill this gap, I take a cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary approach. The re- sults are summarized as follows. First, I suggest "causativity" and "passivity" as the cross-linguistic characteristics of causatives and passives. Relying on these notions, I resolve the confusions in the literature on this topic, and explain some of the phenomena that could not be accounted for previously. Second, for each of the major causative and passive types of the target languages, I provide an analysis in which the syntax and the semantics of causatives and passives are integrated by "Voice", which plays the syntactic role of moving or inserting an argument and the semantic role of assigning event-control (EC) or affectedness. Third, a systematic account of causative/passive ambiguities is also provided in terms of three factors: (a) the same number of arguments at the root verb level and at the sentential level; (b) the surface identity; (c) the fact that the SUBJECT can be either "initiating/permitting the root event (RE)" or "undergoing the RE/affected by the RE". Fourth, two empirical studies confirm: (a) the cross- linguistic differences in passives with a SUBJECT-oriented adverb; (b) the ambi- guity of have-en. Those empirical studies also show how non-syntactic factors such as the effect of an event or the possession relation can affect the interpre- tation of a causative/passive structure. Fifth, the commonalities and differences among the target languages are also illuminated: at least in terms of causatives, passives and their ambiguities, Korean appears to pattern with English rather than with Japanese.

DAI 66, no.7 (Jan. 2006): 2559-A; UM 3181253. This dissertation investigates the fundamental nature of nouns in classifier and non-classifier languages within the context of plurality-related phenomena. The 285</page><page sequence="56">Japanese Language and Literature recent literature contains many suggestions which draw a distinction between classifier and non-classifier languages with respect to the nature of nouns. The fundamental reason for the apparent optional plural marking in classifier lan- guages has been ascribed to the different nature of nouns, e.g., all nouns in clas- sifier languages are mass nouns. The goal of this dissertation is two-fold. First, it shows that there is no funda- mental distinction with respect to the nature of nouns between classifier lan- guages and non-classifier languages. We show that the mass/count distinction of classifier languages such as Chinese is as real as that of non-classifier languages such as English. We demonstrate that the parametric difference in the mass/ count distinction between these two types of languages is how and where the semantic information is encoded. We propose the "Nominal Feature Analysis", which is a feature-based analytic mechanism for dealing with nominal struc- tures. We also show how to achieve the language-universal lexical representa- tion of nominals. The second goal of this dissertation is the characterization of the plural mark- ing phenomena in classifier languages. The unique roles of plural markers in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese are investigated in detail. We show that the plural markers in these languages mark more than the plurality of referents of nouns. The occurrence of a classifier is required in enumerating nominal expres- sion in classifier languages. As is well documented, these languages, in contrast to nonclassifier languages, do not have an obligatory marking of the plurality on nouns. With regard to the fundamental nature of the plural marker in classifier languages, we raise the following questions: (a) Are plural markers in classifier languages really optional? (b) If not, what kind of semantic function(s) do they perform? and (c) In what way(s) are they different from plural markers in non- classifier languages? Not only do we answer these questions, but we also pro- vide micro-parametric variations in the syntax and semantics of plural markers. Finally, we consider the relationship of these parameters in relation to the issue of second language acquisition. [Abstract on pages ix-x of Kim's dissertation]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Kyle B. Johnson. xv, 301p. DAI 65, no. 11 (May 2005): 4177-A; UM 3152715. This dissertation investigates how syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors interact to produce the internally-headed relative clause (IHRC) construction in Korean and Japanese. The IHRC construction differs from the more familiar externally-headed relative clause (EHRC) construction in several ways. First, unlike an EHRC, an IHRC's content restricts the content of the matrix clause 286</page><page sequence="57">Abstracts rather than that of the semantic head. Second, its interpretation is heavily influ- enced by the discourse context in ways not seen with the EHRC. Third, unlike the head of an EHRC, the head of an IHRC does not correspond to any overt syntactic phrase and hence needs to be determined by language users based on the relative clause's content, the matrix predicate's semantics, and the discourse context. The literature offers an abundance of sensitive analyses of the IHRC construction, but it leaves two central questions unanswered: What determines the interpretation of the construction? And, if pragmatic principles play a role, how do they interact with the morphosyntax and the semantics? I answer these questions with an event-based semantic analysis. I show that the construction's interpretation is determined partly by grammatical factors (e.g., the embedded clause's aspect and the matrix predicate's semantics) and partly by pragmatic factors (the discourse context and the discourse participants' world knowledge). In particular, I isolate two sources of the semantic variability of the construction. First, the matrix clause contains a pronominal definite de- scription, whose denotation contains a free relation variable. The value of this variable is determined by the embedded clause's event structure, the matrix predicate's semantics, and the discourse context. Second, the relative operator that occurs in this construction connects the content of the embedded clause with that of the matrix clause, establishing either a temporal or a causal relation be- tween them, depending on whether the embedded clause describes a temporary state or a permanent state. This study establishes important connections between the semantics of a defi- nite description and event structure, thereby solving a particularly challenging formal-linking problem, one that afflicts existing E-type pronoun analyses of the IHRC construction. In addition, it provides a constrained but flexible interpretive mechanism for the construction, eliminating the need for many of the extra- grammatical constraints that characterize existing treatments.

Interpersonal Influences on Gesture Production: Evidence for Gesture Form Convergence across Speakers in Dyadic Interaction. University of Chicago [United States], 2006 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: David McNeill. x, 157p. DAI 67, no.2 (Aug. 2006): 397-A; UM 3206328. When we speak, we move our hands. That is, hand movements that we call gestures emerge during the formulation of thoughts while we attempt to encode 287</page><page sequence="58">Japanese Language and Literature them in socially constituted codes of words and sentences. The intrinsic relation- ship between these two expressive modalities has led researchers to believe that the two modes of thinking (imagistic thinking and categorical linguistic thinking manifested in gesture and speech respectively) comprise a single unit of thought, an "intrapsychological" unit within a speaker's mind. Gestures, however, are social as well as private. In my dissertation, I analyzed video-recordings of cartoon narrations by English- and Japanese-speaking dyads to explore the social or "interpsychological" aspect of gesture production by focusing on how the gestures used by different speakers can show similarity of form. The first study used mirror image stimuli to investigate the relative strengths of the speaker's underlying images and interpersonal gesture coordination in motion trajectory gestures. In one group of dyads (controls), both members of the dyad watched the same stimulus clips. In the experimental group of dyads, each speaker watched a stimulus clip that was a mirror image of the clip watched by the other speaker. The frequency of shifts in gestures' orientation re- vealed that although underlying image has overall stronger influence than co- ordination, speakers tend to avoid apparent conflicts in trajectory's orientation when they produced co-referential and overlapping gestures. In the second study, to isolate the effect of interpersonal coordination from convergence due to speech, I controlled the dyads' visual access to each other's gestures by placing a blind between speakers. A within-dyad analysis on the rate of the same handshapes used by both speakers when narrating with and without a blind revealed a robust effect of mutual visibility. Finally, in the third study, I investigated the coordination of gestures in rela- tion to linguistic context. Detailed analysis of the shift in speech during what I call "gestural mimicry" demonstrated that gesture coordination is not mechan- istic imitation.

I investigate the question of how the units of a linguistic expression are line- arly ordered in syntax. In particular, I examine the interactions between locality 288A</page><page sequence="59">Abstracts conditions on movement and the mapping between syntax and phonology. I show that Cyclic Linearization of syntactic structure and constraints on domain- internal movement of multiple specifiers predict unique ordering restrictions at the edges of syntactic domains. As a consequence of cyclic Spell-out and con- ditions on syntactic agreement, elements externally merged as a constituent at the edge of a Spell-out domain cannot be separated by a domain-internal ele- ment. This proposal provides a unified account of a variety of types of ordering restrictions in scrambling -in particular, floating quantifier and possessor con- structions in Korean and Japanese. Evidence is drawn from interactions among various factors, which include: scrambling, the scope and syntactic position of adverbs, depictive and resultative predicates, possessor constructions, and vari- eties of floating quantifiers, among others. It is argued that the domain of cyclic Spell-out must include the edge as well as the complement of a Spell-out do- main. This challenges the view that edges are designated escape hatches in syn- tax. Other results include arguments that scrambling is feature-driven move- ment, support for the view that syntactic agreement is feature sharing, as well as a particular repertoire of phases (including VP and well as vP).

University of Hawaii at Manoa [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Lin- guistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Kenneth L. Rehg. xvi, 198p. DAI 66, no.4 (Oct. 2005): 1339-A; UM 3171055. This dissertation is about long vowels in Tokyo Japanese and in Pohnpeian, a Micronesian language. Vowel length is contrastive in these two languages, and it is phonologically represented by mora counts. Long vowels carry two moras and short vowels one. The results from three production and three perception ex- periments show that the production and perception of vowel length is not iden- tical between Japanese and Pohnpeian. The proportion of the duration of long to short vowels is much greater in Japanese. Furthermore, not only duration but also pitch fall is crucial for Japanese speakers in marking vowel length, and the use of durational cues among Pohnpeian speakers differs from that of Japanese speakers. The phonetic implementations of long vowels seem to play an impor- tant role in the listeners' categorization of vowel length. The duration of vowels and the amount of pitch fall were measured. The ratio of the mean duration of long vowels to short vowels was not 2:1 in either lan- 289</page><page sequence="60">Japanese Language and Literature guage. In Japanese accented vowels, it was 1.65:1 in fast speech and 1.77:1 in slow speech, and in Japanese unaccented vowels, it was 1.93:1 in fast speech and 2.42:1 in slow speech. In Pohnpeian, it was 1.30:1 in fast speech and 1.47:1 in slow speech. The duration of vowels was vulnerable to speech rates in both languages, but pitch fall in Japanese accented vowels was not. The durational distinction be- tween long and short vowels was increased in Japanese unaccented vowels com- pared to accented vowels, and it was even greater as the speech rate decreased. These results indicate that both duration and pitch fall are important for Japanese speakers to mark phonological vowel length, while Pohnpeian speakers primar- ily used duration to mark vowel length. The patterns of vowel length categorization by each group of language lis- teners agreed with the results from production experiments. Japanese listeners' categorization of vowel length was affected by pitch fall. Even when the dura- tion of vowels was equivalent to long vowels, Japanese listeners were not able to categorize vowel length without an adequate amount of pitch fall. Furthermore, they required longer duration than Pohnpeian listeners to perceive a vowel as long. [Abstract on pages viii- ix of Kozasa's dissertation]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Background. 3.

This dissertation investigates forms, functions, and discursive strategies in English crossing in Korean and Japanese pop culture. The corpus consists of (a) music: 752 songs (395 K-Pop songs and 357 J-pop songs); (b) 20 hours of tele- vision shows: 12 episodes of 6 dramas, 3 shows of one comedy, and 5 episodes of one entertaining English instructional variety show; (c) 6 movies: 3 Korean movies and 3 Japanese movies; and (d) advertising: 720 Korean TV commer- cials and 506 Japanese TV commercials, 413 print ads, and 50 Internet accessed TV commercials. This study argues that Expanding Circle Englishes (ECEs) in Korean and Japanese popular culture exemplify glocalized hybrid language performativity. The findings of this study suggest that English is a creative force in Korean and Japanese entertainment media and is associated with modern, young, liberal, and defiant identities. English in Korean and Japanese pop culture is localized at dif- ferent linguistic levels including lexical, phonological, syntactic, morphological, and discursive features. English is often remade for domestic use in local con- 290</page><page sequence="61">Abstracts texts no matter how deviant it may appear to inheritors and source populations of Inner Circle Englishes (ICEs). English crossing serves as the entry point for young Koreans and Japanese into a global economic order and is positioned as a positively valued strategy of individuals. In particular, bilingualism and linguistic versatility in the form of crossing into languages other than one's own can be viewed as empowering, insofar as it creates opportunities for Koreans and Japanese to participate in the global economy, and not as mindless capitulation to domination by the United States.

On the Past Tense in Japanese Relative Clauses. University of Washington [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Karen T. Zagona. 2, vi, 294p. DAI 66, no.7 (Jan. 2006): 2559-A; UM 3183387. This dissertation investigates the past tense marker -ta in Japanese relative clauses with two empirical goals: (a) to examine and explain how the past marker -ta is construed, and (b) to investigate the conditions that determine the tense construal of the past marker -ta . Two environments are considered: (a) the past in relative clauses under main clauses with past verbs, and (b) the past in relative clauses under main clauses with non-past verbs. I claim that the past -ta has two points of orientation for its interpretation: the moment of utterance and the main clause events. The two options are realized as the feature [+Deictic] on the head of Tense Phrases. The selection of features itself is not constrained by the theory of tense. I argue, however, that the orientation of tense is determined on the basis of at least two factors: the licensing of Deictic temporal adverbs and the definiteness of relative clause head nouns. Therefore, my main goal from a theoretical perspective is to construct a theory whose coverage includes these two factors and to explain how they interact with tense. The proposed analysis addresses some problematic aspects of the previous analyses, which either do not have sufficient empirical coverage to account for the Japanese cases or adopt some theoretical machinery (e.g., movement of relative clauses) in order to ob- tain desired readings without explaining how ambiguity with respect to temporal location of events in relative and main clauses is resolved. In addition, I extend the analysis to two other kinds of temporal adverbs (Clock-Calendar, e.g., Sun- day and Dependent, e.g., the following day) and show that the temporal interpre- tation of all three types of temporal adverbs is syntactically explained in a simi- lar way with the feature [+Deictic]. Then, I discuss how definiteness determines 291</page><page sequence="62">Japanese Language and Literature the choice of orientation. Indefinite head nouns only allow tenses in relative clauses to be interpreted in relation to main clause tenses. Definite head nouns do not have such a restriction, that is, they are interpreted independently of main clause tenses. I further explore the phenomenon and explain why definiteness is related to the temporal interpretation of relative clauses.

A Study of L1 Influence in the L2 Acquisition of Japanese with Respect to a "Poverty of the Stimulus" Phenomenon.

Contact the University of Durham Libraries (Stockton Road, Durham DH1 3LY, United Kingdom) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number DissLing 1998/MAR). The "Full Transfer/Full Access" hypothesis of second language (L2) acqui- sition (Schwartz and Sprouse, 1996) claims that the first language (L1) grammar forms the initial Interlanguage grammar. The modification of this grammar is then motivated by evidence in the target language input. The present thesis in- vestigates this hypothesis by replicating an experiment by Kazue Kanno ("The Stability of UG Principles in Second-Language Acquisition: Evidence from Japanese". Linguistics 36 (1998):1125-46), which looks at a poverty of the stimulus phenomenon in the L2 acquisition of Japanese by native speakers of English. The phenomenon in question is a constraint existing only in null subject languages (and, therefore, in Japanese but not in English) which bars overt pro- nouns from having quantified NPs as antecedents. The thesis is organised as follows: Chapter One first gives an explanation of how an investigation of L2 poverty of the stimulus problems can contribute to our understanding of the role of Universal Grammar in L2 acquisition, and then it relates the predictions of the Full Transfer/Full Access hypothesis to L2 pov- erty of the simulus problems. Chapter Two describes the syntax of the phenom- enon to be examined and gives an overview of Kanno's investigation of this phenomenon. Chapter Three details the hypothesis, design, and method of the present experiment. Chapter Four presents the experimental results. Chapter Five compares the results of the present experiment with those of Kanno and addresses questions arising from the analysis of these results and the results of a 292</page><page sequence="63">Abstracts further control experiment. The thesis concludes that the experimental results presented herein support the claims of the Full Transfer/Full Access hypothesis.

This dissertation investigates native language (L) influence and innate lin- guistic knowledge (i.e., Universal Grammar) in non-native language (L2) acqui- sition by means of a comparative interlanguage study of quantifier scope inter- pretation in L2 Japanese, by adult native speakers of English, Chinese and Korean. The phenomena investigated are: (a) the availability of object-wide scope in sentences with an existentially- quantified subject and universally-quantified object (e.g., Someone read every book). (b) the availability of a pair-list reading in questions with everyone as the subject and what as the object (e.g., What did everyone buy?). Picture-sentence match tasks are developed to investigate these two phenomena in native Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean, as well as in English/Japanese Chinese/Japanese and Korean/Japanese interlanguage. The native experimental data confirm that, with respect to (a), the object-wide scope interpretation ("for each book, someone read it") is readily available in English but not in Japanese, Chinese or Korean; and with respect to (b), a pair-list answer (e.g., Sam bought apples, Jane bought pears, Sue bought .. .) is readily available in English, Chi- nese and Korean, but not in Japanese. 293</page><page sequence="64">Japanese Language and Literature These cross-linguistic differences are exploited in the investigation of two main predictions based on Bonnie D. Schwartz and Rex A. Sprouse's (1994, 1996) Full Transfer/Full Access model of L2 acquisition: (a) the L2 learner groups will show divergent development with respect to Japanese scope inter- pretation due to the distinct scope interpretation possibilities in their respective Lis; (b) advanced L2 learners of Japanese will demonstrate native-like knowl- edge of quantification phenomena even under severe poverty of the stimulus, due to L2 acquisition being constrained by UG. The results support both predic- tions. On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that both the L and UG are privileged sources of knowledge in the L2 acquisition of phenomena at the syntax-semantics interpretive interface.

University of Texas at Austin [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Nicholas M. Asher. xii, 268p. DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2912-A; UM 3185711. This dissertation examines several issues at the semantics-pragmatics inter- face in Japanese and English: modal subordination, particles and adverbials. Chapter Two presents the framework that is used throughout, and applies it to English modal subordination. In Chapter Three, the realization of modal subord- ination is shown to be quite different in Japanese than in European languages; in particular, the construction of discourse structure plays a much greater role. This chapter discusses the semantics of the Japanese modals and the realization of evidentiality within them. Modal subordination in Japanese can be licensed by certain discourse par- ticles. In Chapter Four, I turn to these particles, showing that the dynamic sys- tem developed in Chapter One can be extended to their analysis, although exten- sions involving deontic modality, underspecification and revision of information states are required. After making the necessary extensions, a semantics is formu- lated that accounts not only for the particles' ability to license modal subordi- 294</page><page sequence="65">Abstracts nation but also for other aspects of their meaning that have been noted in the lit- erature: insistence, restriction to new information, and others. Chapter Five continues the discussion of particles, concentrating on English man. Man exhibits quite different properties when it appears sentence-initially and sentence-finally; sentence-final man is semantically much like the Japanese yo, even licensing modal subordination in certain contexts. Sentence-initial par- ticles and expletives are shown to exhibit semantic restrictions on their dis- tribution and also clear truth-conditional effects on the sentences they appear in. Their interpretation is shown to depend a great deal on intonational factors in two senses. The semantics of degree constructions are also shown to be affected by the particles in certain circumstances. Chapter Six, the final chapter, steps away from particles to consider several complex adverbials in Japanese, each one of which has an emotive component to its meaning. First, a pair of related adverbials, yoku and yokumo, are consid- ered; they exhibit clear interactions with interpreter knowledge and the common ground. The final part of the dissertation turns to another adverbial, sekkaku, which is very context-dependent in that certain aspects of its meaning depend on world knowledge.

Japanese Women's Listening Behavior in Face-to-Face Conversation: The Use of Reactive Tokens and Nods. Michigan State University [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Mutsuko Endo Hud- son. 2, xiii, 186p. DAI 66, no.4 (Oct. 2005): 1340-A; UM 3171497. The present study examines Japanese women's use of reactive tokens (Patricia M. Clancy et al., 1996) in Japanese face-to-face conversation and perception of other's listening behavior in relation to the social variables of age and conversa- tion styles (formal and informal). Reactive tokens examined in the present study are eight verbal reactive tokens such as backchannels, reactive expressions, and laughter and one non-verbal reactive token, nods. The investigation is based on a quantitative analysis of formal and informal conversation data from thirty participants and qualitative data of participant in- terview. The perception is examined on the basis of the ratings of five different listening behaviors in videos and interview. The findings show that the use of re- active tokens was influenced by age and conversation styles but that perception does not vary according to age. Age influences the proportion of nods and verbal reactive tokens in the formal conversation. The younger participants use more nods and fewer verbal reactive tokens than do older participants when there is a difference in power between a 295</page><page sequence="66">Japanese Language and Literature speaker and a listener. In the informal conversation, there is not age-graded ef- fect in the use of verbal reactive tokens and nods but three common interaction styles by all age groups are identified. The variation of listening behavior in the present study is explained by "multi- dimensional model" (Deborah Tannen, 1993) in which four social contexts are defined by power and solidarity between participants. The follow-up interview and the results of perception study revealed that the perception of other's listening behavior may not vary according to perceivers' age. Participants perceived the one which is closest to their own performance in informal conversation most natural in the present study. This confirms Dell Hymes's notion of "Speech community" (1974) that members of a speech com- munity share norms. The findings of the present study suggest that nods are used as reactive tokens as a strategy to mitigate face threatening acts (Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson, 1987). In Japanese women's face-to-face conversation, social varia- bles of age and conversation styles play important roles in the choice of an ap- propriate listening behavior in the contexts.

A Syntactic Structure of Lexical Verbs. University of Maryland at College Park [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Juan Uriagereka. 2, vii, 276p. DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 4372-A; UM 3202038. In this dissertation, I propose a syntactic structure for verbs which directly encodes their event complexities. I present a model that is "internalist" in the Chomskyan sense: Aktionsart properties of predicates are not a real-world affair, but the interpretation of a mind structure. For this purpose, I base my proposal on the Dimensional Theory of Juan Uriagereka (2005). Syntactic constructs are in this view the results of operations that create increasingly complex objects, based on an algorithm that is homo-morphic with the structure of numerical cat- egories. First, I propose that Aktionsart can be read off from structural complexities of syntactic objects and their associated "theta-roles". Specifically, I present the SAAC Hypothesis: Syntactic complexity in a verb is reflected in the number of syntactic arguments it takes. This approach, within the confines of the Dimen- sional Theory, results in an emergent "thematic hierarchy": Causer - Agent -- Locative -- Goal -- Theme. I test the accuracy of this hierarchy and concomi- 296</page><page sequence="67">Abstracts tant assumptions through paradigms such as the control of implicit arguments, selectional properties of verbs, extractions, aspect-sensitive adverbials, etc. Second, I argue that the verbal structure which I propose is syntactically and semantically real, by extending the proposal in Howard Lasnik (1999) on VP ellipsis from inflectional to derivational morphology. I discuss two contrasting methods of morphological amalgamation in English and Japanese, executed in Syntax and PF, respectively. This demonstrates a tight network of entailment patterns that holds of verbs, derived crucially from the architecture I argue for. Third, an analogous point is made through the structural positionings of caus- ative and inchoative derivational morphemes in Japanese. There, each order of structural complexity has a profound impact on the class of eventualities which a derivational morpheme can describe. "Dimensional talks" are observed between certain derivational morphemes, which presumably find their roots in operations of the computational system within the Dimensional Theory. I show that the ver- bal structure in Japanese reflects directly an underlying bi-clausality that I argue for, in terms of derivational morphemes, further supporting a natural mapping between syntax and semantics. This is, in the end, an attempt for a "Minimalist" theory of Aktionsart.

Con- tact the University of Canterbury Central Library (Christchurch, New Zealand) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number P130.52.A8. N147 2002). This dissertation attempts to examine language contact phenomena in the speech of first-generation Japanese adults in Australia and New Zealand through the analysis of interview and other spoken data. Its major objectives are to (a) describe and analyze the types of transference and integration phenomena iden- tified in the corpus, (b) identify and analyze the types of strategies employed by first-generation Japanese speakers in Japanese-Australian/New Zealand English contact, (c) investigate the types of lexical transfers (i.e., loanwords) peculiar to 297</page><page sequence="68">Japanese Language and Literature the Australian/New Zealand environment, and (d) investigate the factors affect- ing lexical transference. The basic assumption underlying the dissertation is that there are principles which we may call strategies at work behind language contact phenomena and that these strategies (i.e., processing, monitoring, and social) affect contact pro- cesses such as transference and integration. These three types of strategies oper- ate concurrently and generate rules for transference and integration under the influence of certain more general principles (i.e., maxims and determinants) prevailing in a given contact setting. In this dissertation, evidence is presented to show that interdialectal differences in the types of lexical transfers are attribut- able to differences in rules, strategies, maxims, and determinants operating in different bilingual communities. Various factors are involved in transference. It is observed that according to their length and type of stay, Japanese speakers employ different contact strate- gies. In the interview situation with a newcomer from Japan, migrants tend to suppress lexical transference while sojourners are likely to adopt it. The choice of contact strategies depends primarily on whether the speaker and the interloc- utor share the same communicative norm. In a dynamic type of bilingual situa- tion such as that found in the Japanese communities in Australia/New Zealand, the communicative norm is in a state of flux, and therefore the Japanese speakers in these communities employ a set of contact strategies which allow them to ex- plore an ad hoc norm for communication with respect to lexical transference.

Similarities and Differences between Japanese and Americans on Their Use and Perception of Polite Speech. DePaul University [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Psychology). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Linda A. Camras. xii, 178p. DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 6956-B; UM 3200267. This study was designed to examine the similarities and differences between Japanese and Americans in their use of politeness in a request. It examined the effects of three politeness-influencing factors-distance, degree of imposition, and legitimacy of the request-on the speakers' intended level of politeness (ILP), the perceived likelihood of gaining compliance (PLGC), and the raters' perceived politeness (RPP) of those requests. The effect of gender on these vari- ables was also examined. All three situational determinants had significant effects on the PLGC scores 298</page><page sequence="69">Abstracts of both nationality groups. Only distance and imposition, however, had signifi- cant effects on the ILP scores for both groups. The legitimacy of the request did not affect ILP scores save for the Japanese males who intended more politeness in the low than in the high legitimacy condition. The Americans, in general, in- tended more politeness than did the Japanese, and their directives were also per- ceived as more polite than the Japanese directives by American raters. Further- more, female directives were rated as more polite than male directives. There also was evidence to suggest that the universality of Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson's model of politeness should be reconsidered due to substantial differences in the findings for Americans versus Japanese. In particu- lar, the findings suggested that the Americans' use of politeness may be moti- vated by a desire to gain compliance. The results did not suggest that this might be true for the Japanese. This may be due to differences in the perception and/or definition of face by these two nationality groups.

This thesis analyzes the kinship terms for parents that are used by college-age native speakers of Japanese. Through the analysis of surveys and audio-recorded conversations, I demonstrate the relationship between the use of kinship terms and the social aspects of gender difference, interlocutor difference, and formal- ity. The results show that (a) male speakers use a wider variety of terms than female speakers both for addressing and referring to parents, (b) the socially ex- pected humble terms (chichi for father, haha for mother) are mainly used for ref- erence only in very formal situations by both genders, and (c) more polite terms are used as the social distance with the interlocutor increases. I argue that both genders, but male speakers in particular, use a variety of kinship terms to adjust overall politeness, express solidarity, and present a particular self-image. This thesis thereby demonstrates that the use of kinship terms contributes to the dy- namic use of language. [Abstract on page iv of Nakajima's thesis]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Background. 3.

The exploration of possible similarities between music and language has been the focus of a number of studies. Music and language both utilize auditory and oral channels to perceive and produce sounds, and this shared domain has at- tracted the attention of researchers. Various approaches have been taken in in- vestigating this fascinating area; they range from theoretical and generative ap- proaches to methodological approaches. Andrzej Rakowski (1988) among others discusses universality in music and language from the viewpoint of the limited power of phonemes in language and the limited intervals of the scale in music. He claims that the operation of trans- mitting information takes on the same coding system in music and language, with respect to the complex psychological properties involved. The suggestion that certain properties may be shared between the musical domain and the lan- guage domain of human cognition has served as the starting point of this empir- ical study. This thesis identifies possible correlates in Japanese phonology of three ele- ments of music. Japanese geminates, vowel lengthening, and pitch accentuation are hypothesized to be correlates of rhythm (particularly syncopation), time du- ration and pitch in music; and an experiment is conducted to investigate aptitude in these three elements of music and in the three areas of L2 Japanese phonol- ogy. This approach of examining musical features and language-specific pho- netic features can contribute to the debate arising from the generally holistic ap- proach of previous studies. A test battery was newly constructed, drawing on conventional measures such as Carl Emil Seashore (1938) for music aptitude and J. B. Carroll (1981) for language aptitude. The results, obtained from twenty adult native speakers of English, show some correlation between rhythm, in music, and geminates, in phonetics. This led to a further discussion of the cognitive aspects of perceiving, integrating and interpreting the meaning of input. I speculate that the issues raised by the analysis and discussion of the results of this thesis can be further explored in future studies, focusing particularly on the details of psychological questions, along with the analysis of L2 phonology (including phonetics) and musical representation.

This dissertation attempts to understand the nature of Case marking and agree- ment through a detailed study of Icelandic and Japanese. My investigation fo- cuses especially on the nominative Case in certain objects and in non-finite sub- jects. I address the question of how nominative case can surface on NPs other than finite subjects. For this purpose, I develop a new theory of Case and agreement based on Chomsky's (2000, 2001, 2004) recent theory of long distance agree- ment. I propose that AGREE by a single Probe with multiple Goals can take place sequentially (Sequential AGREE). Under the theory of Sequential AGREE, I make two significant assumptions: nominative is uniformly licensed by T and the size of infinitival complement clauses varies (Susanne Wurmbrand, 2001). By investigating Icelandic, I show that not only finite T but also non-finite T licenses nominative. Evidence comes from the person restrictions in dative- nominative constructions, Case-marked PRO, and intervention effects in Ice- landic. Adopting Wurmbrand's idea, I give a unified account for the distribution of embedded nominative NPs and optional agreement facts between such NPs and the finite verb in bi-clausal dative-nominative constructions in Icelandic. I propose that the optionality comes from whether the infinitival complement is TP or smaller than TP in Icelandic. Based on Japanese facts of scope interactions among the nominative object, potential verb, and negation, I argue that nominative is licensed only by T and not by any other category between T and the nominative argument licenses nominative. Case alternation in potential constructions in Japanese derives from Wurmbrand's idea: when the complement clause is larger than v*P, the accusa- tive is licensed on the object by v*; when the complement clause is smaller than v*P, the nominative is licensed by the matrix T via Sequential AGREE. Providing relevant data from Icelandic and Japanese, I attempt to argue that nominative NPs in finite clauses are all licensed by the same T and that nomina- tive NPs in non-finite clauses can be licensed exactly in the same way as the ones in finite clauses. Throughout the dissertation, I solidify the claim that re- gardless of its finiteness, only T licenses nominative Case. [Abstract at the be- ginning of Nomura's dissertation]. Contents: 1.

University of California at Los Angeles [United States], 2004 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cul- tures). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Shoichi Iwasaki. xviii, 227p. DAI 65, no.11 (May 2005): 4178-A; UM 3155026. This dissertation examines the structural development and the characteristics of morpheme reduplications (or doubling) in causative, potential, and passive constructions in modem Japanese. Two of these reduplication phenomena are often referred to as causative sa-insertion and potential re-insertion. However, passive ra-insertion and other longer, fully reduplicated insertions such as sase- insertion and rare-insertion are also observed. Previous studies have traced the historical development of the modem potential suffix -(r)rare (Fumio Inoue, 1998; Hideo Komatsu, 1999; Inoue, 2003), but little has been done on the recent aforementioned insertions. This study analyzes the morpheme insertions (partial and full reduplications), using data obtained from the Internet, to note their inci- dence and trending, as well as to hypothesize why such changes may be taking place. The main focus is on the causative sa-insertion-how consonant verbs are preferred over vowel verbs, how certain sentential patterns such as the bene- factive -(s)ase-te-itadaku and passive-causative constructions include sa-inser- tion more than others, and the role that sa-insertion plays in the overall historical development of the Japanese language. The hypothesis for the insertion phenomena is that they are emerging as a form of intensifier to compensate for an "insufficiency" in meaning. For causa- tive sa-insertion, there is a demand to increase the politeness level of the bene- factive expression -(s)ase-te-itadaku. For potentials, re-insertion follows a mor- pheme reduction in the form of ra-deletion, where the potential form results in a shorter form. To some speakers, this reduction takes away from the potential meaning, leaving a desire for a way to add more "potentialness". These mor- pheme insertions fulfill a certain need for clearer, more transparent meaning. In- sertions provide a more distinct, analyzable structure: -(s)aSAs- (versus -(s)as-) for causatives, and -(r)eRE- (versus -(r)e-) for potentials. In addition to a longer and more transparent morpheme, insertions contribute to a millennium-long process of simplification of the conjugation paradigm. With re-insertion, and to an extent the sa-insertion, the conjugation paradigm for the consonant and vowel verbs can be united to form one conjugation paradigm for all "regular" verbs. Thus, the multiple morpheme changes over the past thou- sand years has led to a common morpheme and a common conjugation paradigm for all vowel and consonant verbs.

Development and Maintenance of Minority Language Literacy in Japanese- English Bilingual Children in Australia. University of Sydney [Australia], 2001 (Ph.D. in Linguistics).

This dissertation adopted an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the de- velopment and maintenance of minority language literacy in Japanese-English bilingual children in Australia, focusing on the longitudinal development and maintenance of Japanese writing skills among school-age Japanese-English bi- linguals (ages 6-12) who reside outside the Japanese community and attend a weekend Japanese school in Sydney. More specifically, the study compared longitudinal data with cross-sectional data from (a) Japanese-English bilinguals who also learn Japanese at a weekend school in Sydney, but live in the Japanese community, (b) Japanese monolinguals who are schooled in Sydney, and (c) Japanese monolinguals in Japan. The dissertation's objective was to examine (a) the nature and development of literacy in Japanese as a minority first language in contact settings, (b) the influences of the socio-cultural and the individual contexts on minority language literacy, and (c) the interrelationship between the socio-cultural context and the individual context, in order to find a way to pro- mote and achieve higher levels of literacy in a minority language. Both descrip- tive and statistical analyses were employed. With regard to the first issue, the findings of the cross-sectional analyses sug- gested that the bilinguals' Japanese is characterized by two features: develop- ment and transference. The longitudinal data of written Japanese was collected from bilinguals residing outside the Japanese community in order to examine the effect of contact on the development of minority language literacy. The results of the analyses showed that while there are some changes in the occurrence of non-standard features at group level, and in the amount of writing in some indi- viduals, overall literacy development is minor. Also revealed is the fact that it is not parentage (endogenous or exogamous families), but the degree of writing practice that is important for the development of literacy in this sample. The examination of the second issue including the whole bilingual population showed that both the socio-cultural and the individual contexts are important for the development of minority language literacy. In particular, the following fac- tors of the individual context were identified as significant for the development and maintenance of literacy and general ability in Japanese in a minority con- text: continuous and extensive use of the Japanese language and its scripts in 303</page><page sequence="74">Japanese Language and Literature both public and private domains, a high degree of community contact, positive identification with both language groups, and parental attitudes that encourage their children's maintenance of Japanese. As for the influence of the socio- cultural context, the presence of a Japanese community was found to promote literacy in Japanese. The predominance of English at the macro-level, however, overrides such positive effects at the micro-level. Specifically, the absence of wider socio-cultural support and experience, alongside monolingual English education hampers the acquisition of literacy and related registers in Japanese. In fact, the gap between Japanese-English bilinguals and Japanese monolinguals in literacy widens with each grade after the second grade, when the learning of higher levels of literacy and more formal academic registers takes place. Furthermore, the results regarding the third issue confirmed the interrelation- ship between the socio-cultural context and the individual context of language use and attitudes. The existence of a Japanese community significantly encour- ages private language use among bilinguals, but does not affect their cultural and group identification. It is the broader socio-cultural context that has a greater effect on attitudes, however, and the tendency to favor identification with Aus- tralian culture [group] and to reject identification with Japanese culture [group] increases with age and the length of residence. In short, the results of the study suggested the insufficiency of individual and community efforts to compensate for the lack of extensive socio-cultural and educational support for the development and maintenance of Japanese literacy. Therefore, in view of the widely demonstrated benefits and effectiveness of bilingual education, this study argues that there is an urgent need for effective bilingual education for background speakers if Australia aims to maximize the potential of its human resources.

This dissertation addresses the Japanese speech act, aisatsu, at two university social events: nyigakushiki and kyojukai. Notes from participant observation 304</page><page sequence="75">Abstracts and supporting written texts add an ethnographic dimension to the recorded spoken data of these two different events. This study of the use of language in everyday situations measures the ways in which speech acts, and their corre- sponding gestures, are "framed" by the events and "constructed" by the speak- ers. Japanese language both produces and is a product of social behavior; and in this case, acts, genres and events are related to macro-level discussions in the anthropology of formalized and ritual language reflecting social ideals and con- ventions. Japanese has a relative abundance of ritual language and speech levels, as do other major Asian languages such as Javanese, Hindi, Korean, Thai and Malay. Specifically, I discuss the extent to which the polite aisatsu of these two speech events is used to introduce an element of social distance and political expedi- ency in the discourse of these events, and how this language is used as a form of posturing, a kind of self-defense or "wrapping". The data also imply that both the social event and language performance are used to emphasize, or deempha- size, social boundaries at a Japanese university. The use of aisatsu in these two events suggests that its common interpretation as "greeting" or "formal greet- ing" is perhaps too narrow, and that we need to expand the notion of this Japa- nese speech form to include a longer "formal address or speech". Likewise, the creativity in the use of such a formal speech genre as aisatsu shows the agency of the speakers and questions the notion that context is a determinant of lan- guage use. Finally, this analysis of two instances of social interaction at a Japanese insti- tution provides, in a modest way, a "thicker description" of what it is to "be" a member of a Japanese university.

A Multimodular Analysis of Japanese Quantifiers. University of Chicago [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Linguistics). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Jerrold M. Sadock. xii, 171p. DAI 66, no.3 (Sept. 2005): 979-A; UM 3168381. This dissertation is an attempt to analyze Japanese quantifier phenomena in the light of a multimodular grammar (adopted from Jerrold M. Sadock's Auto- lexical Syntax, 1991), which postulates several parallel independent modules. Japanese has numerous quantifiers which occur both NP-internally and NP- externally. Their syntactic and semantic properties are not uniform. Further- more, a single quantifier can occur in either of two possible NP-internal posi- tions. Previous studies have concentrated their discussions on one group of quantifiers, that is, numeral quantifiers, and focused on one module, either syn- tax or semantics. This study proposes a unified analysis of Japanese quantifiers based on an examination of their properties in the modules of syntax, semantics, 305</page><page sequence="76">Japanese Language and Literature and information structure, which is adopted from Enric Valluvi's The Informa- tional Component (1992). Quantifiers are shown to have three NP-internal patterns and their syntactic properties are examined. NP-internal quantifiers are shown to be NP in the syn- tax and M(CN) in the semantics. They can be G-specific in the sense of Feng- Hsi Liu (Scope and Specificity, 1997) or non-specific depending on the position inside the NP. NP-external quantifiers are shown to be Ad-V in the syntax and M(Pred) in the semantics. A difference between NP-internal and NP-external quantifiers is exhibited in the information structure, with NP-external quantifiers triggering ALL-FOCUS sentences. Antecedentless quantifiers are shown to have a special function in discourse. In addition, non-case-marked WH-numeral quantifiers are shown to be a subset of antecedentless quantifiers. Their syntactic and semantic behavior is best understood in terms of a categorial mismatch. After the introduction, the dissertation gives a brief overview of the previous analyses on the key issues of Japanese numeral quantifiers in the second chapter. The third chapter is devoted to a typological analysis of Japanese quantifiers based on their syntactic properties. The fourth chapter discusses the semantic properties and differences among quantifiers. The fifth chapter investigates the information structure and sentences with quantifiers. Differences in the informa- tion structure of wa-marked and ga-marked sentences are also examined. The sixth chapter studies the interfaces between syntax and semantics, and between syntax and information structure. [Abstract on pages xi-xii of Reynolds' disser- tation]. Contents: 1.

There is a considerable amount of language contact between English and Japanese in the current linguistic environment in Japan. This environment re- sults in the frequent use of English loanwords, or gairaigo. This thesis addresses the theory and actual use of English loanwords in Japan. Part One addresses the mechanics of how English words become part of the Japanese lexicon. Special attention is paid to morphological patterns such as ab- breviations, compounding, and changes in parts-of-speech. Because of the rapid- ity of change in the field of loanword usage, existing scholarship on the subject 306</page><page sequence="77">Abstracts must be constantly reviewed and updated. Herein, conventional theory is com- pared to the usage of actual loan words in two widely-distributed Japanese newspapers, the Yomiuri Shimbun and the Asahi Shimbun, based on samples that were collected in April 2000. Newspapers are a unique form of language expres- sion in that they not only reflect the language that is in use but also help to shape it. This dual role makes newspapers particularly appropriate for a study of this nature. As expected, the corpus collected in Part One (see pages 104-59: Appendix B: Newspaper Loanword Database) contains a number of forms typically absent from research on loanwords in Japanese. Conversely, many of the patterns de- scribed in past literature are unattested in the newspaper corpus. Patterns vary in different contexts due to the fluid characteristics intrinsic to loanwords. This study attempts to move from purely academic theories to an understanding of the current state of loanwords in the Japanese language. Part Two is an annotated bibliography that addresses various facets of loan- word usage in Japan. Categories found in the bibliography include "General", "Pop-Culture Treatment of Gairaigo", "Historical Perspectives", "Phonology and Transcription", "Loanwords in Overseas Japanese", and "Dictionaries". Of particular value are the works listed in the "Pop-Culture" section, for while they are not commonly included in conventional scholarship, these works do express the attitudes and views of typical speakers of Japanese. The annotated bibliography (pages 54-100) is intended for students of the Japanese language and Japanese culture who require varied resources related to loanwords. It should also be useful to those who are seeking areas in need of further study or an overview of the field as a whole.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Awako Kano. viii, 323p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2198-A; UM 3179801. Women's speech in Japan is a gendered category of language, which has been reinforced by the expectation of society towards women since the late nineteenth 307</page><page sequence="78">Japanese Language and Literature century. It was constructed according to the demands of the modem state, which required that Japan's national language, kokugo, be standardized. The language policy implemented by the government, however, did not overtly include women's speech in its problematized topics and discussions. This dissertation investigates how women's speech and national language policy were interrelated during the modem period, and how this past relationship has been inherited as a gendered legacy of language use in the present. To examine Japanese women's speech as an issue of language policy, I use a covert/overt distinction as the framework of this study. Unlike overt language policy, covert language policy is not codified, but functions effectively in soci- ety. In my study, women's speech is a covert language policy, which was paired with overt language policy and conducted by both the government and new/old middle class women as agents during the 1890s-1920s. Women's speech was strongly influenced by the government's gender policy, ryosai kenbo or "good wife, wise mother". This policy required the use of modest and gentle language for women. Although it encouraged women to actively choose polite, feminine language, it also allowed them to resist the policy and create rough, deviant speech. I found that concepts which restricted women's speech were thoroughly promoted during the 1890s-1920s through educational texts such as colloquial grammar books, school textbooks, educational women's magazines, and modem literature. The forms of women's speech developed more on the basis of the genbun-itchi style in literature than on the language reform that was promoted by the government. During the post-World War II period, discussions at Kokugo Shingikai [The National Language Council] as representative of overt Japanese language policy indirectly included women's speech as an issue related to keigo [honorifics]. Although the boundaries of the feminine and masculine use of lan- guage became blurred, it is clear that women's speech is hard to terminate and that a certain degree of gender discrimination through language use still remains.

The concept of linguistic imperialism has long been proposed in the field of critical applied linguistics, but little research has been done in the case of Japa- nese linguistic imperialism, which was enthusiastically pursued in Asia before World War Two. This thesis discusses the implementation of Japanese language policy in Japan-colonized/occupied Asia through 1945 as an assimilationist in- struction. I also refer to the other varieties of linguistic imperialism, namely that of English and French, for comparative purposes. [Abstract at the beginning of Shimoji's thesis]. Contents: Introduction. 1.

DAI 66, no.2 (Aug. 2005): 575-A; UM 3163406. This dissertation reports the results of a study of a vowel reduction in Japa- nese. Vowel reduction (durational and spectral) has been observed in many lan- guages; however, only a few studies have been conducted that research Japanese phonetic vowel reduction. Furthermore, in these studies, the factors influencing duration and formants were not controlled. I investigated vowel reductions in Japanese, while controlling the factors influencing duration and formants. In my study, vowels in the functional particles /ga/, /de/, and /to/ were compared with word-final vowels in lexical words. The overall results show that there was a significant effect for LEXICAL on DURATION and F1 values but not on F2 values. When I looked at the lexical ef- fect for individual vowels, vowels [a] and [o] showed lexical effect on DURA- TION but [e] did not. I sought the reasons for the absence of lexical effect on DURATION of [e] and concluded that lexical effects on [e] were not observed because of phrase final lengthening. For formants, only [a] showed a significant lexical effect on F1 and F2 values but [e] and [o] did not. The lack of observation of a lexical effect was probably due to the short locus distance between alveolar consonants, [d] and [t], and vowels, [e] and [o], respectively. Furthermore, I investigated the possible coar- ticulation effects of consonants on vowels and V-to-V coarticulation effects. Durational and spectral vowel reductions for [a] were observed, which raised the question of whether duration is the only factor that causes spectral vowel 309</page><page sequence="80">Japanese Language and Literature reduction. In the undershoot hypothesis, the short duration of reduced vowels leads to spectral vowel reduction; in other words, duration is the only factor that causes spectral vowel reduction. I investigated whether or not there was a lexical effect in addition to a durational effect. The results indicate that there was a sig- nificant effect for LEXICAL on Fl values. Function particles have a low infor- mation value; consequently speakers do not articulate these function particles clearly. In my hypothesis, there are two targets (content and function) instead of one target.

Second, they identified the tokens in the AXY-discrimination task. Results showed that syllabic structure contributed sig- nificantly to the production and perception of Japanese pitch contrast, but differ- ently in native and non-native speakers. Its effect varied according to the accent type of the words. Significant differences were observed mostly in unaccented words. The analysis of accent correctness revealed that in the unaccented con- ditions, for both L1 and L2, CVCVCV tokens were produced better than words with non-syllabic morae. Correctedness of L2 perception in unaccented words also deteriorated in words with non-syllabic morae. No correlation was found between the production and the perception of pitch patterns.

The position of negation in the phrase structure of Japanese remains a conten- tious question in the literature. Where a particular position is adopted, it is not always done so consistently with other works, and specific choices are not al- ways justified. Judgments regarding the scope of negation would be very valu- able for reaching a final principled account of negation's place in the phrase structure, but unfortunately the literature on that matter also is not clear. The data regarding the scope of Japanese negation is so contradictory and lacking in an empirical base that some researchers have declared it to be useless for syn- tactic analysis (Naomi Fukui and Hiromu Sakai, "The Visibility Guidelines for Functional Categories", 2003). Seeking solid scope data upon which to base a conclusion about the structure of negation, we used a Truth Value Judgment Task (Stephen Crain and Rosalind Thornton, Investigations in Universal Gram- mar, 1998) experiment to elicit scope judgments from forty-eight native speak- ers of Japanese in the Vancouver metropolitan area. Participants were shown scenarios designed to elicit judgments on Q &gt;Neg or Neg &gt;Q readings, using two different forms of negation. Based on the results of the experiment, we reached a conclusion placing NegP relatively low in the phrase structure, within the vP domain. Furthermore, similarities between the results of this study and a similar study on Korean (Chunghye Han, Jeffrey Lidz and Julien Musolino, "Verb-Raising and Grammar Competition in Korean", 2003) imply that overt verb raising exists for half of native Japanese speakers, and lead to further ques- tions in the larger domains of head-final languages, and language acquisition.

This dissertation investigated the acquisition of internal state words by Japa- nese children while engaged in conversation with their mothers. The acquisition of a lexicon of words referring to internal states is an important step for children in acquiring emotional competence, which is the knowledge of socially approp- riate ways of expressing and responding to emotions and feelings in oneself and in others. Forty-one middle class mothers and their children (mean age of girls = 2;2, mean age of boys =2;3) participated in the study. Twenty dyads were boy- mother pairs; twenty-one dyads were girl-mother pairs. The mothers and their children were visited at home and were asked to read a wordless picture book and to have a snack. The mothers were also asked a standard set of questions about their child-rearing beliefs after the observations were recorded. The obser- vations were audio- and video-taped and transcribed. All internal state words were coded for their category, meaning, function, and other features, and ana- lyzed using pairwise t-tests and chi-square analyses. The independent variables included the children's gender and the context. The results were compared with those from studies of English-speaking children. The participants produced quite different internal state words, depending on the conversational setting: thus context is a variable that must not be ignored. In terms of gender differences, the boys and their mothers used significantly more sensory perception words than the girls and their mothers, and the boys were more concerned with volition and ability than the girls; by contrast, the girls and their mothers used significantly more positive affect words than the boys and their mothers. The mothers encouraged the boys to be strong and assertive, while a greater emphasis with the girls was on being affectionate and sensitive to others. The comparisons with studies of English-speaking children illustrate the acquisition of internal state words that reflect values characteristic of Japa- nese culture. The children were learning the cultural values of belongingness, empathy, and occupying one's proper place in society. By selectively discussing internal states, the mothers led their children towards emotional competence ap- propriate to their gender, to the social context, and to the society in which they live.

These findings tend to support models like the Dual Route Cascaded Model (Coltheart, Rastle, Perry, Langdon, &amp; Ziegler, 2001) in which lexical access occurs via two routes, one in which phonology is directly retrieved in parallel, and a second in which pho- nology is computed serially. This model predicts that consistent languages rely more on the computational route, whereas less consistent languages rely more on the direct route. If lexical parsing preferences require that languages differing in consistency engage distinct processing, for bilinguals, two languages that dif- fer in consistency should function independently. Bilingual word recognition re- search, however, demonstrates that both languages are active and competing, even when they differ in consistency, a finding captured by the Bilingual Inter- active Activation model (Dijkstra &amp; van Heuven, 1998). This creates a paradox for word recognition in that cross-language interactions occur, but for lexical parsing, both languages appear to function independently. To examine this par- adox, three experiments were performed, using tasks shown to reveal parsing preferences. In each experiment, the performance of native English speakers and proficient non-native speakers of English was compared in English. In the first experiment, participants made lexical decisions to stimuli including pseudo- homophones, to compare native and non-native spelling-to-sound computation. In the second experiment, participants performed clustered lexical decision in which word and nonword stimuli were parsed after the onset or the first vowel to compare the importance of the rime unit in processing. Finally, in the third ex- periment, participants named words and nonwords including English-German cognates to examine how second language processing strategies differ for German-English bilinguals in the presence of strong first language cues. In Experiments 1 and 2, the results were similar for native English and native German speakers. In Experiment 1, native Japanese speakers also produced sim- ilar results in English, although their performance was more dependent on their proficiency in English. When native German speakers named English words in Experiment 3, however, both first and second language processing strategies were revealed. The implications for current models of word recognition are dis- cussed, and a bilingual Dual Route model is proposed. [Abstract on pages iii-iv of Sumutka's dissertation]. Contents: 1.

The discussions of this dissertation center around the question of why it is possible in Japanese to relativize a subject out of a subject and why it is more problematic to relativize an object out of an object. Both relative clauses are not readily allowed in English and in many other languages. The latter phenomenon is predicted by the Subjacency Condition. One component of the answer lies in the structure of Japanese, which has been characterized as an SOV language. I argue that the clause-internal structure of Japanese is considerably different from that of English and other SVO lan- guages. I apply the central claims of the Antisymmetry Theory (Richard S. Kayne, 1994) to derive the clause-internal structure and the structure of the pre- nominal relatives of Japanese. The analysis also incorporates multiple comple- mentizer projections (Rizzi 1997) to accommodate the order flexibility of this language. For the derivation of prenominal relatives, I argue that there is no operator movement; instead, movement of the "head" nominal phrase is pur- sued, the possibility of which is reintroduced in Kayne (1994). The discussion also includes a proposal of a KP system to account for the absence of KP/PP relativization in Japanese. Another ingredient of the answer concerns the formulations of locality condi- tions. Two of them--a condition on agreement and a condition on movement- are discussed extensively from a Minimalist point of view (Chomsky, 1995, 2000, 2001). For the former, I adopt a version of the Intervention Condition. For the latter, I suggest that neither old Subjacency nor the Phase Impenetrability Condition is optimal, and I propose a new condition: the Opacity Condition. I demonstrate that the raising of the "head" in the relativization of a subject out of a subject relative in Japanese is ruled out by neither the Intervention Condition nor the Opacity Condition, while that the raising of the "head" in the relativi- zation of an object out of an object violates the Opacity Condition. Finally, I discuss issues on overt resumptive pronouns, counter-examples, and wh-ques- tion. [Abstract on pages iv-v of Suzuki's dissertation]. Contents: 1. Introduction. 2.

This dissertation takes a semantically based tense/aspect approach to the long- 314</page><page sequence="85">Abstracts standing problem of wa- and ga-markings of "subjects" in Japanese. It argues for a correlation between wa/ga-markings of "subjects" and tense/aspect inter- pretations of clauses. The two types of tense/aspect interpretations correlated with wa- and ga- marked subjects are pinned down in terms of (a) two types of"evaluation time", which are distinguished as "original" and "new" (Eng, 1987), (b) two types of reference time (Reichenbach, 1947): one that coincides with speech time but not with event time, and the other that coincides with event time but not with speech time, and (c) two types of "viewpoint aspect" (Smith, 1991): one that presents "part" of a situation manifested at a precise temporal point (View past) and the other than presents "all" of a situation without decomposing it (View all). In order to provide syntactic mechanisms to account for the correlation be- tween wa/ga-markings of "subjects" and the two distinct types of tense/aspect interpretations, I propose two subdivisions of Tense in line with Chomsky's (1995) suggestion that Tense might have "further subdivisions and implications about event structure and perhaps other properties". I assume that the two subdi- visions of Tense are functional categories making up an articulated tense struc- ture (above VP) and that they contain distinct semantic features that are re- sponsible for the distinct tense/aspect interpretations correlated with wa- and ga- markings of subjects in Japanese. Being tense categories, they both have Tense- features and Determiner-features to be checked by predicates and subject DPs respectively. Due to the distinct semantic content of the two syntactic categories, depending on which Tense- and Determiner-features predicates and subjects check, we get two distinct types of tense/aspect interpretations of predicates and two distinct types of subjects (which are morphologically distinguished by wa- and ga-markings in Japanese). In this analysis, the Tense- and Determiner- features of a tense category ensure that a subject and a predicate are necessarily of the same semantic type. The tense system that I propose in order to account for the wa/ga-phenom- enon unifies tense and aspect to the extent that the wa/ga-phenomena relate to the interpretation of both tense and aspect. A notable consequence of my analy- sis is that the syntax and semantics of stage- and individual-level predicates (cf. Carlson, 1977; Kratzer, 1989; and Diesing, 1992) fall under the syntax and semantics of tense. The analysis also exhibits some interesting parallelisms to Davis' (1998), in which person features of subjects are related to a temporal structure. In addition, the proposed two subject positions within the articulated tense structure are demonstrated to be tenable across languages. Furthermore, I show that the reanalysis is extendable to subordinate clause case markings and interpretations, with special attention to factors such as fac- tivity and the distinctions among propositions, states of affairs, and situation- types.

This dissertation examines the phenomenon of external possession, in which a possessor of a verb's argument is licensed syntactically as an argument of the verb. I provide a uniform account of external possession in both Japanese and Korean in terms of a thematic operation. I develop a theory of theta-role assignment which takes seriously the widely held assumption that theta-roles are purely syntactic objects and hence exist independently of the semantics associated with them. This view suggests that theta-roles can be dissociated from the semantics determined by the predicate's lexical meaning and be re-associated with distinct semantics made available dur- ing the course of a derivation (Vieri Samek-Lodovici, 2003). In external possession, I argue that Possessor semantics is re-associated with a theta-role of the verb. This process is possible when the possessor is realised as a resumptive pro within the projection of the possessee argument, which has the consequence that the semantic representation of the possessee argument contains a variable corresponding to the possessor. The verb subsequently assigns the re- associated theta-role to the external possessor. I show that the present theory can explain the well-known obligatory "af- fected" reading of the external possessor of an object and the lack of it for the external possessor of a subject. I argue against analyses which postulate move- ment of the external possessor or attribute its construal to purely semantic or pragmatic inferences, as the phenomenon is more restricted than such analyses suggest. External possessors in Japanese and Korean take on the case of their posses- sees. In discussing other types of multiple nominative constructions, I demon- strate that such constructions do not necessarily involve a thematic operation. I also show that for case-licensing in these constructions, structures containing multiple specifiers as well as those with multiple copies of the licensing head are required.

This dissertation in developmental psychology examines how Japanese chil- dren develop their understanding of the two scripts of their language: kana and kanji. The hypothesis to be tested is that children undergo a three-step develop- ment in achieving a conventional understanding of the reading strategies associ- ated with each script. The first and second experiments are semi-structured interview studies that show that non-readers either do not have any firm ideas of what kana and kanji represent, or that they interpret single characters as representing multiple moras. Kana readers either have the understanding that single kana and kanji characters represent single moras, or they have the correct understanding that kana repre- sent moras and that kanji represent multiple moras. The third experiment is a structured experiment examining how Japanese chil- dren interpret characters within single words and phrases written in kana and kanji. The results show that non-readers either show script-irrelevant responses when shown kana and kanji, or adopt a logographic reading strategy in which they interpret single characters as representing single words. Readers interpret single characters as representing single moras, or show script-appropriate re- sponses to kana and kanji text. The fourth experiment is a longitudinal study examining how children's re- sponse strategies developed over a five-month period. The results provide direct evidence that the children followed a three-step sequence. This development is found to be generally associated with an increase in kana reading ability and with the ability to visually discriminate between the two types of scripts. Overall, the experiments suggest a developmental progression in which chil- dren initially adopt a logographic reading strategy without the assistance of ex- ternal teaching, which is generalised to both scripts. This stage is followed by the over-generalisation of a moraic reading strategy, once the children have started to learn kana. This stage is followed by the final stage, in which correct reading strategies are used in each script condition.

This thesis addresses the difficulty of obtaining good English translations of Japanese by analyzing a segment of Japanese expository writing to show that there are many discourse techniques employed by Japanese writers that do not transfer when translating text into English. Whenever a source text in Japanese utilizes a number of these unique discourse strategies, it must be rewritten and adapted to the logic and discourse strategies of the English language in order to communicate the author's message and main ideas. The source text for this analysis, Wa-dansu shfisei ("A Collection of Japanese Furniture". 1982), was chosen because of my interest in Japanese furniture. It contains a collection of nearly five hundred photographs of tansu furniture from the early through the Meiji periods, as well as five short essays written by dif- ferent authors. Each essay is a self-contained, cohesive article dealing with one aspect of tansu. The first essay, entitled "Wa-dansu no kigen to sono hattatsu" ("The Origin and Development of the Japanese Tansu"), by Kiuchi Takeo, was chosen simply because it came first in the list of essays. It is an eleven-page expository writing divided into five sections that centers around the historical as- pects of the tansu. The original text of the essay, as well as a free translation and adaptation, are provided in the appendices. After the text was analyzed and rewritten in the form of an adaptation, a small study was conducted among Japanese-speaking readers to explore some Japa- nese perspectives regarding the differences in discourse style between Japan and the West. This study involved translating the sections of the Adaptation that had shown the greatest variation in discourse style in the original text back into Japa- nese. The reverse translation and the original Japanese text were then evaluated 318</page><page sequence="89">Abstracts by Japanese-speaking readers, who were asked to compare the two discourse styles. While the results of these small studies, conducted on a total of forty samples, has a quantitative nature, most of the thesis is qualitative rather than quantitative in nature.

This thesis has its origins as a term paper for a seminar in historical linguis- tics. Dr. Wilbur A. Benware, who was the instructor for this seminar, encour- aged me to investigate the historical development of the aspect system in Japa- nese by adopting two approaches that we discussed in the seminar: those of Bernd Heine ("Grammaticalization as an Explanatory Parameter", 1994), who adopts the notion of grammaticalization, and of Helmut Lidtke ("Epistemologi- cal Remarks on Language Change and Language Universals", 1977), who ap- plies General Systems Theory to language change. My term paper was primarily a brief overview of the development of a few aspect markers in Japanese. As the complexity of the issues (both the aspect systems of human languages and the process of grammaticalization) demanded a more thorough treatment, the term paper was expanded into this M.A. thesis. In Chapter One, I examine the various factors, such as verb types, grammat- ical markers, and other lexical items, which constitute the aspectual meaning of a clause. In Chapter Two, I analyze three theories that illustrate the process of grammaticalization, which is a phenomenon based on human cognition involv- ing various linguistic evolutions, such as phonetic/phonological, morphological/ morphosyntactic, and syntactic changes. I also discuss how the notion of mark- edness relates to grammaticalization. In Chapter Three, I look at the develop- ment of six aspect markets in Classical Japanese--tsu, -nu, -keri, -tari, -ri, and wiru--by adopting the theories discussed in the first two chapters.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: David Embick. ix, 285p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2197-A; UM 3179832. This dissertation studies complex causative predicates, such as "pound flat", in relation to a question of verbal valence, with a focus on Igbo, Mandarin Chi- nese, and English. When a noun phrase enters a thematic relation with a nearby verb, does that relation project from the verb, or is it introduced by its structural context? Despite the attention given to this question, its answers are often hard to distinguish empirically. Yet complex causatives can provide a sharp diagnos- tic for the valence of verbs that occur in them. In English they suggest that agent and patient relations typically project from the verb. In Igbo and Mandarin, they show clearly that the typical verb has no arguments lexically. Agent and patient relations are introduced by structures extrinsic to the verb and, in the case of complex causatives, extrinsic to the complex predicate as a whole. Principles that relate the distribution of arguments to predicate meaning are correspond- ingly stated over structures larger than individual verb roots. These conclusions simplify the description of thematic interpretation and transitivity alternations in complex causatives, and the account of cross-linguistic differences in these same areas. Theoretically, they underscore one central point. The valence of a verb is not a trivial consequence of its meaning. Verbs that describe the same event can nevertheless differ in the number of participants which they have as lexical argu- ments. The dissertation also examines the typology of word order in complex causatives, based on a broad survey of languages, including Malayalam, Japa- nese, Edo, Vietnamese and Nosu Yi. It shows that variation derives from whether the predicate that describes the result of causation is a head or a phrase. [Abstract on page v of Williams' dissertation]. Contents: 1.

This longitudinal study examined the ways in which a multilingual and mul- ticultural child living in the United States developed and acquired his Japanese language skills. The subject was a boy who simultaneously acquired three diff- erent languages-Japanese, Swedish and English-from the age of two years and four months to three years and four months. The data were obtained from mother-child conversations that were regularly recorded, primarily in the United States but also in Japan. The major findings were that the subject initially mixed the three languages to a considerable extent, but towards the end of the study, he could hold conversations entirely in his dominant language, though he would still switch languages according to context. The environment strongly affected his language development, where direct inputs and attention from caretakers ap- peared to be the most important factors in establishing language dominance. Fi- nally, the author speculated that there was approximately a one-year difference in the subject's grammatical development compared to that of a normally devel- oping monolingual child. [Abstract on page iv of Yahata-Pettersson's thesis] Note: The subject of this study, the author's eldest son Carl, was born in Berk- eley, California, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, where his parents pursued their graduate studies at area institutions. His parents spoke to him only in their native languages (Japanese and Swedish), but they used English when communicating with each other. Accordingly, Carl heard English conversations at home. In addition, he attended two preschools in the San Francisco Bay area, where he interacted with other children in English, and spent two months in a small countryside town in Kyuishu while visiting with his grandparents, where he had the opportunity to go to a hoikuen (Japanese preschool) on a daily basis.

It 322</page><page sequence="93">Abstracts attempts to identify the cultural forces underlying the rhetorical and linguistic characteristics of the genre through multi-layered accounts of such texts. A surface-level analysis of the genres identifies the following major character- istics: (a) adherence to a rigid structural format of introduction, including sea- sonal greetings, main body and concluding remarks; (b) indirect and implicit discourse patterns, providing rather lengthy introductory and concluding parts, with a relatively brief main body; and (c) a profuse use of formulaic expressions with honorific language, many words of Chinese origin, and devices to eliminate the use of "I" and to avoid the direct address of "I" and "You". These features are central to the great concern for proper social relationships among the Japa- nese discourse community. The letters are further analyzed from sociocultural perspectives, particularly a strong emphasis on the maintenance of harmonious interpersonal relationships; for in Japan, the consciousness of rank in a group-oriented vertical society serves as a social norm and regulator of social behavior, including verbal prac- tices. The result is a great concern for form over content, indirect or implicit dis- course patterns, and the differentiation of linguistic codes. The ideological roots of Japanese society, with its principles and prescribed social etiquettes, are fundamentally traced to Confucianism. Confucianism rein- forced interpersonal relationships and the resulting discourse patterns describe what is presently found in Japanese society. The impact of Zen Buddhism is de- tected in the Japanese propensity for non-verbal and implicit discourse practices wherein the ability to infer is required. In addition, both Zen and Shinto are con- sidered as possible origins of the inclusion of seasonal greetings in Japanese let- ters. I suggest that this knowledge and the genre analysis of familiar texts of every- day life can be incorporated into the regular curricula of advanced-level reading and writing Japanese classes in order to increase awareness that each text is in- fluenced by various social and cultural forces.

This dissertation is a study of the inflection appearing on adjectives in Japa- nese. The goal of this work is to investigate the structure of adjectival construc- tions in Japanese and its relation to adjectival inflection. In pursuing this goal, I 323</page><page sequence="94">Japanese Language and Literature examine standard Japanese in comparison with other world languages, as well as several dialects spoken in Japan. Chapter One reviews the general patterns of inflection appearing on attributive adjectives in world languages, including English, Spanish, German, Russian, Icelandic, Swedish, Romanian, Igbo, Jukun and Balanta. Comparative study suggests that inflection on adjectives in their noun-modifying function typically falls into one of the following categories: (a) agreement, (b) case-marking, (c) definiteness marking, (d) incorporated/reduced relative clause material, (e) long- and short-form morphology, and (f) adverbial marking. A simple question is: which category does Japanese adjectival morphology belong to? Chapter Two introduces data of adjectival forms in Japanese, with special attention to inflection. Japanese is unique in that it contains two morphologically distinct types of adjectives, which I call "true adjectives" and "nominal adjec- tives". I discuss the two types from morphological, syntactic and semantic per- spectives, and review the main literature on the topic, which ranges from Japa- nese traditional grammarians in the early twentieth century to generative gram- marians in the framework of Chomsky's classic feature-decomposition theory. Chapter Three examines the nature of the attributive adjective inflection in Japanese, taking up the possibilities sketched out in the first chapter, and intro- ducing the most widely accepted analysis. Traditionally, grammarians and lin- guists have assumed that Japanese attributive adjective inflection represents incorporated/reduced relative clause material ((d) above). I show, however, that this idea is not sufficient to analyze all prenominal adjectives in Japanese. I pre- sent crucial semantic data that undermine the traditional analysis. I also offer evidence from distributional patterns. The traditional analysis is based almost entirely on data from standard Japanese, but there is in fact great morphological variation in Japanese dialects, and the inclusion of these patterns directly chal- lenges the traditional view. Dialect data are introduced from previously pub- lished work as well as from my own field notes. Chapter Four further explores the nature of the inflection on attributive adjec- tives in Japanese. Detailed examination in Chapter Three eliminates all but one analytical possibility: case-marking ((b) above). I argue that the status of Japa- nese as a case-marking language, as well as the historical development of Japa- nese adjectival inflection, makes the case-marking analysis plausible. I then dis- cuss the remarkable similarity between Japanese adjectival inflection and the so- called Ezafe marking on adjectives and other nominal modifiers observed in Indo-Iranian languages such as Persian, Kurdish and Zazaki. Ezafe has been convincingly argued to be a case-marking phenomenon, hence the parallelism lends further support to a case analysis. In the remainder of the chapter, I extend the case marking analysis of prenominal inflection to the other adjectival con- structions in Japanese, including (primary) predicatives, small clauses, secon- dary predicatives, and adverbials. Chapter Five constitutes a technical argument for the case-marking hypoth- esis. Japanese contains an elliptical construction in which a small set of Japanese true adjectives of space and time appear to license a null space/time nominal precisely when inflected with the morpheme -ku. Case-marking is known to li- 324</page><page sequence="95">Abstracts cense empty nouns in Dutch, and Japanese -ku inflection appears to form a class with -i inflection insofar as -i and -ku can alternate in certain circumstances. I argue that if -ku is analyzed as a case-marker, like -i, then the Japanese null nominals can be assimilated to the Dutch ones: both instances can be viewed as the licensing of a null nominal by case-marking.

Chairperson/Major Ad- viser: Matthew S. Dryer. xii, 360p. DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 4374-A; UM 3203907. When speaking, the speaker has a general idea about what he or she is going to talk about. He knows how to form a grammatical sentence, and he knows what grammatical roles he is going to assign to who and to what. In a language such as Japanese where the assignment of grammatical roles does not involve constituent ordering, the speaker has to decide in which constituent ordering to deliver a sentence. For example, when a Japanese speaker wants to say "Fred saw John", he first assigns case particles, possibly the nominative case particle ga for "Fred" and the accusative case particle o for "John". The speaker then has to decide in which order, Fred-ga John-o or John-o Fred-ga, he will deliver the sentence. I first investigate three factors that are pertinent to the choice of one constit- uent ordering over another: recency of previous mentions, cataphoric persistence and syntactic heaviness of the constituent. Recency is quantified by Referential Distance (RD), cataphoric persistence by Topic Persistence (TP), and syntactic heaviness by Syntactic Weight (SW). The relative measurement of RD, TP and SW between the two constituents in question indicates that the constituent with a lower RD, a higher TP or a higher SW tends to come before the constituent with a higher RD, a lower TP or a lower SW. Based on the patterns between factors and the earlier position, algorithms are formulated to examine if the algorithms can correctly predict the ordering choice between SOV and OSV. Applying the algorithms to the data shows not only that single predictors, RD, TP and SW, can make correct predictions, but also that the combination of three predictors can predict with a higher success rate than the single predictor or the combi- nation of two predictors. In addition, other factors, the focus structure, the use of the particle wa and demonstratives, the light verb construction, and scene-setting and topical elements, are explored. The algorithms based on the factors are fur- ther applied to clauses containing the subject, the direct object and other phrases 325</page><page sequence="96">Japanese Language and Literature to examine if the factors are relevant to predicting what comes first or what pre- cedes what.

Yamashita surveyed address term usage in Japan- and UK [United Kingdom]- based native Japanese language teacher (JLT) speech communities in order to establish whether differences in addressing behaviour occur between such speech communities. Her research results revealed that, at a general level, ad- dress term usage by Japan-based JLT tends to be more formal and less variable than that of UK-based JLT. Furthermore, it appears that the role of confounding factors, such as age and gender, either play a minor role in determining address term usage or none at all. Observed differences in address term usage for Japan- and UK-based JLT are believed to be a product of the modification of the basic Japanese addressing system by UK-based JLT in accordance with a much more informal academic setting in the UK. Compared to Japan, addressing amongst JLT in the UK dem- onstrates greater reciprocity, and addressing relationships are far more symmet- rical. [Abstract on page i of Yamashita's thesis].

DAI 65, no.10 (Apr. 2005): 3785-A; UM 3151137. This dissertation investigates the notion of social identity within James Paul 326</page><page sequence="97">Abstracts Gee's (1989, 1996, 1999) framework of discourse. A Christian testimony is a type of personal narrative in which the believers' experiences are evaluated in terms of values and beliefs from the Scripture, which is the communal guiding norm. Construing social identity as membership in a discourse, this study ex- plores social identity which is presented, negotiated, and socialized in narration as situated social practice. When we narrate a story, we evaluate our experiences in terms of communal values and expectations. These communal expectations of "how to be a good person" constitute an integral part of our identity. In our attempts to reconcile our personal experiences with communal expectations, we, as narrators, go through "problem-solving", or a process whereby we present ourselves as good and socially competent people. I argue that the presentation of testimony is constrained by the shared values and beliefs which consist of a discourse in this particular community. The nar- rators made reference to the spiritual values, which rendered the believers' per- sonal narrative into testimony, recounting how they worked through a problem with God's assistance. Moreover, presenting their responses to the narrative problems as reflecting the moral values from the Scripture, the narrators struc- tured the narrated events as moral events in order to create their moral identity as good Christians. I also argue that testimony can be a site of socialization, where novice members are socialized into the shared values and beliefs through interaction with expert members. Finally, the testifiers in the present study are Japanese immigrants and non-immigrants who practice their faith in Hawaii. Japanese values are still an inseparable part of their identity. I demonstrate that these two sets of values (i.e., Christian and Japanese) are alternately recognized as two separate discourses or integrated to form a single Christian discourse. I also indicate that the narrators negotiate morality between the two conflicting perspectives. Through ethnographically-informed discourse analysis, this research aims to shed new light on the complex nature of social identity which is constantly de- fined and evolves through interpersonal interaction.

How the social status of the requester and the politeness level of the request affect people's indirectness in refusing re- quests are compared between the two cultures by eliciting the written data. The request responses in open-ended data are analyzed based on the classifications of refusals developed by Lesie M. Beebe, Tomoko T. Takahashi, and Robin Uliss- Weltz (1990) and the refusal tactics of Mary J. Bresnahan, Deborah A. Cai, and A. Rivers (1994). The analysis shows that the use of strategies and their frequen- cies are similar between Americans and Japanese, but the number of strategies and the degree of indirectness and face threat in responses differ. Americans are more likely to accept or move towards the cooperation of the other's request while Japanese tend to mitigate their refusals by using more strategies. This study suggests that the cultural preferences in direct and indirect communication styles do not always apply to the use of language in face-threatening situations. The indirectness in the use of language is not different between Americans and Japanese. The differences in indirectness in the request responses between the two cultures are in the clearness of the speaker's standpoints between the com- pliance and the refusal of the request.

Chinese does not allow causative alternating unaccusative verbs or object- Experiencer psych verbs. It employs analytical causative (headed by shi "make"), resultative (headed by de) and compound causative (with an activity predicate VI and a result predicate V2 forming a V1-V2 compound) construc- tions to represent causativity. The present dissertation explored the syntactic and semantic properties of these verbs and constructions within the generative framework. I proposed that Chinese unaccusative verbs and psych verbs involve a single VP and that Chi- nese resultative and compound causative constructions involve a functional cate- gory AspP. I conducted an empirical study to look into the mental represen- tations of these Chinese verbs and constructions in the second language Chinese 328</page><page sequence="99">Abstracts grammars of native speakers of English, Japanese and Korean. My research aimed at finding out whether L transfer persists in L2 Chinese and whether L2 learners can acquire the functional AspP involved in Chinese resultative and compound causative constructions. The experiment consisted of a cloze test, a production test, an acceptability judgment test and a comprehension test. It involved fifty-five English speakers, fifty-six Japanese speakers, seventy-three Korean speakers and twenty-eight na- tive Chinese as controls [at universities in Beijing and the University of Cam- bridge in England]. Both developmental patterns and variations between dif- ferent language groups were examined to see whether L2 Chinese learners can acquire native-like mental representations of the structures examined and whether L2 groups from different L1 groups show any variation in their L2 Chi- nese mental representations. The results suggested that L2 Chinese learners are more likely to make causative errors with Chinese unaccusative verbs than with psych verbs and that compound causative constructions are more difficult to ac- quire than resultative constructions in L2 acquisition of Chinese. I concluded that L1 transfer does not happen everywhere and that functional categories un- available in the learners' first languages can be properly represented in L2 Chi- nese grammars.

This dissertation compares various modes of literary censorship in Japan and the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s under imperialism and democ- racy, employed by occupiers and inflicted on the occupied. Considered as a "mi- nor literature", banned fiction and poetry serve not only as marginalized others 329</page><page sequence="100">Japanese Language and Literature to be catalogued and assimilated into the realm of the readable, but also as traces that suggest the contours of the unreadable and unwritable. Three broad themes destabilize notions of radically identifiable modes of suppression and enable my comparison: how the archivization of censorship reveals the explicit and implicit components of historical censors; how sedition and obscenity-the two major criteria for literary censorship during the period-were internalized and resisted by the censored; and how official state censorship forms a continuum with self- censorship, critical scorn, and canon formation. Drawing on an array of Japanese and American literary and historical sources-including collections of censors' examination copies, statistical analyses of book production and sales, literary manuscripts, trial records, and police reports--I propose that any study of mar- ginal literatures must also recognize the continued construction and reconstruc- tion of new margins by critical discourses. "Pages Crossed" argues the ethical necessity of reading the literary casualties left behind in the path of a violence to texts that transcends war and its political institutions.

This dissertation focuses on a series of public discussions about the roles of women and the proper relationship between women and the state in late nineteenth-century Japan. During the 1870s, as Japan's leaders confronted a hostile world, they encountered an idea with great currency in the West, that the status of women reflected a country's level of civilization. Although Japanese elites initiated dialogue about women's roles out of concern for the country's reputation vis-&amp;-vis the outside world, the conversation soon moved to an emerging public sphere, taking place in both speech and in print. Participants included men in and outside of government as well as women who made claims 330</page><page sequence="101">Abstracts concerning their rights and responsibilities in the new polity. Talk about women had a variety of meanings depending on the speaker and the context. Commen- tators addressed subjects including the newly-assimilated concept of "rights", the meanings of "equality" and the proper place of women in and outside of the home. Whereas previous scholarship assumes women's inevitable exclusion from public life, this dissertation reveals a much broader and far-reaching set of dis- courses on the subject of women's roles and rights than scholars have heretofore imagined. Never just about that status of women, discussions were connected to issues including the shape of the new polity, national rights, and Japan's place in the hierarchy of nations. Chapters move from an exploration of the meanings of terms to an investigation of the ways that women engaged in public. I pay par- ticular attention to the process by which women moved from their status as ob- jects of reform to participants in an increasingly expanded public sphere. At the same time, I show how women laid claim to new modes of public expression which they retained even after their formal exclusion from politics. The dissertation demonstrates that modernity gave rise to mixed consequences for women. On the one hand, women were given a language of rights, an oppor- tunity to cast aside old notions, and the chance to represent themselves in print and to play a limited political role. On the other, as gender began to supersede status, women were defined as a group as never before and their sphere of action was restricted in unprecedented ways.

DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2222-A; UM 3181680. This dissertation explores how writers and directors in modern Japan have utilized the figure of the "controlling" mother to articulate various inequalities that have accompanied Japan's ongoing negotiations with the sociopolitical and epistemological authority of the West. Locating mother-son depictions in narra- tives from three different periods in Japan's modern history, I show how this trope was sometimes used to represent the maturation of the individual and at other times the development of the nation. In Chapter One, which examines works by Meiji period writers Futabatei Shimei and Higuchi Ichiyo, I show how 331</page><page sequence="102">Japanese Language and Literature sons are depicted as being reluctantly pulled by their mother figures into new worlds revolving around financial concerns. These depictions reflected discom- fort with the rapid societal changes taking place at that time. Chapter Two moves to early postwar works, where mothers exerted control over their sons not by forcing them towards an uneasy future, as they do in the Meiji works, but by beckoning them towards the safety and comfort of a childhood past. I interpret these narrative formulations as responses to the emphasis on patriarchal author- ity found in what had come to be seen as Freud's version of "Oedipus". Perhaps because a model of normativity based on a powerful father figure proved ill suited for the case of a recently defeated Japan, this period saw a re-envisioning of Japanese culture along matricentric lines. I show how Yasuoka Shatari, Tanizaki Jun'ichirb, and Yoshida Yoshishige grappled with this tendency by re- enacting, rebutting and even mocking the Oedipal myth. Although these works expose how Western epistemological discourses reinforced existing hierarchies between Japan and the West, their resistance was undercut by the complexity of their narratives. Such an ambivalent stance is also present in later postwar works, which I discuss in Chapter Three. Filmmaker Masumura Yasuz5, for ex- ample, expresses his ambivalence by employing the mother-son dynamic as a metaphor for and diagnosis of the "social pathology" plaguing postwar Japan, at once critiquing the materialism of the 1960s and providing a cautionary tale that sees normative heterosexuality as a casualty in Japan's rise to economic power.

Para-reality is de- fined as a state in which polar natures coexist and influence each other, and their boundaries are sometimes ambiguous, as if their opposing elements are identi- cal. That is, this idea offers visions of joining, both-and, ambiguity, or coexis- tence of polar natures. 332</page><page sequence="103">Abstractsine The view ofpara will contribute to the reconsideration of the dualistic way of thinking. Dualism is characterized by the master code of dividing, either-or, or excluding. As Jacques Derrida acutely points out, Western metaphysics dichot- omizes morality, values, and other concepts to binary opposites, thereby hier- archically ranking the oppositions as superior/inferior. The dichotic view tends to think little of the other seenasons the inferior, giving rise to a rift between the binary natures. This way of thinking does not provide a place for human relative and subjective intuitions, reconciliations of conflicted things, or equal co-rela- tionships between two domains. In Japan, para-reality is a traditional worldview that it is expressed as many metaphoric images in myths, literature, arts, poems, or manga. In order to discuss the map of para, this dissertation follows the mythopoetic analysis. This method sees various phenomena and ideas through their fundamental images and myths. This study also uses the textual pluralism approach, which decon- structs a dominant interpretation of a myth. This method makes it possible to understand a narrative from various points of view. Reading a tale from this perspective, one can notice many images and voices of the individual characters that are regarded as subjugated or secondary positions in the story. The textural pluralism is highly important for reading the Japanese myths. Japanese mythology in Kojiki and Nihongi is compiled from the political per- spectives of the imperial isan in early Japan. In their images and characters, the myths describe the superiority of the early Japanese government over other tribes in Japan and other countries in East Asia during the eighth century. Mean- while, this study discovered new para-realistic imageries by focusing on each character and their voices in the same Japanese myths. [Abstract on pages iii iv of Awazuhara' s dissertation].

The performance art form butolic (butoh) that was bo from the political and cultural maelstrom that swept Japan in the 1960s has confounded observers everywhere. Hijikata Tatsumi (1928-1986), the co-founder with Ono Kazuo of buto, experienced an analogous personal maelstrom as a transplant from rural 333</page><page sequence="104">Japanese Language and Literature northeastern Japan (Thoku) to the re-energized Tokyo of the 1950s. The crux of my argument is that a performance art form that is often seen as mysterious gains that enigmatic quality by its location at the crossroads of several philo- sophical, artistic, and political debates. These include a renewed focus on the body, new theories of subjectivity and selfhood, a re-evaluation of (personal) experience, explorations into pain (as well as violence and sacrifice), attempts to contest social mores, questions about the nature of gender, forays into new kinds of actor training, a re-evaluation of the actor vis--vis the audience and chore- ographer with a concomitant de-emphasis of expression, a renewed interest in surrealism, a phenomenological exploration into the properties of things and objet, worries about the extent of socialization and the strength of epistemic structures, a focus on the differential between the metropolis and the periphery, attempts to construct an effective political discourse in the face of failed student protests, and attempts to contest the exoticizing attitudes of the West. As Hiji- kata negotiated this laundry list of concerns, he formulated a style of dance that responded to each of them in a unique (and sometimes contradictory) way.

DAI 66, no.11 (May 2006): pp.4143-A; UM 3196781. Focusing on the period 1750-1912, this dissertation traces the trajectory of eccentrism in Japan among aesthetes engaged in cultural production (the fine arts, literature, drama, and artisanry) with the aim of problematizing the "mod- ernization" of Japanese subjectivity. Throughout this period, aesthetic eccen- trism existed both in practice as an identity of resistance and in literature within an emergent genre of biographical writings on eccentrics (kiinden). While the diversity of individuals cultivating these identities challenges precise definitions of the terms used to signify aesthetic eccentricity (i.e., ki and ky), the phenom- enon does follow a distinct trajectory during this volatile period. The individuals examined in this study are uncomfortable in public and offi- cial spheres and seek autonomous aesthetic spaces informed by practices of re- clusion and aestheticism anchored in Chinese and Japanese tradition. By dressing themselves in a mantle of aesthetics, eccentrics (kijin and kyjin) em- 334A</page><page sequence="105">Abstracts brace both nostalgia for a happier past and ideals of otherworldly individualism. Furthermore, by clinging to utopian interiority, they employ strategies of "mak- ing do" as they negotiate the demands of the cultural field. Their success in this endeavor is dependent upon a continually fluctuating culture of sociopolitical tolerance. Japanese and Western scholarship has examined this topic through the lens of modernization and determined that the irreverent individualism exhibited by eccentrics marks them as anti-feudal (modern). It has looked to the historical antagonism between Daoism and Confucianism and concluded that the Daoist (Zhuangsian) origins of the kijin identity stand in resistance to Neo-Confucian ideology and the bakuhan system. In contrast, this study finds that aesthetic ec- centrism is informed by a plurality of intellectual traditions, Neo-Confucianism foremost among them. Second, it argues that the tendency to view kijin and other non-conformists as hallmarks of modernity is anachronistic and too easily submits to the commercial interests that have constructed the kijin as a literary icon since the late eighteenth century. Identities of difference, of which kijin and ky6ijin are only recent manifestations, have been endemic to the artistic field throughout Japan's history.

This dissertation examines the integrity of the characterization of Murasaki, a principal heroine in the classical masterpiece, Genji monogatari (The Tale of Genji). This lengthy novel, written almost one thousand years ago, is rich in metaphor and intertextuality and allows for diverse interpretations. The dissertation provides an overview of characterization in the story and ex- plores in detail how Murasaki is portrayed. Through a comprehensive analysis of the language used to describe her, including specific expressions, metaphors and images, and an examination of her social, cultural and historical context, the 335</page><page sequence="106">Japanese Language and Literature dissertation concludes that Murasaki's personality, depicted in many fragmented scenes, realistically represents a true embodiment of the profound human psyche and its development over time, arguing against the view that Murasaki is unreal- istically and inconsistently characterized. The Tale ofGenji is regarded as the first fictional story written in Japan that sheds a realistic light on the innermost world of human beings. It focuses on the conflict between love and pride. Unlike earlier stories, it is clearly evident that Murasaki, and many of the other female characters, exhibit great pride and self- esteem. Their pride lies in their individuality, while their love exists in their interrelationships, both of them factors intrinsic to human existence. As the story is set in Heian Japan's polygamous society, women falling in love with Genji, the main protagonist, are destined to suffer serious inner conflict between the pain of their love and their hurt pride. This conflict takes place within a context in which maintaining one's appearance is of paramount importance. Suffering makes such women introspective, especially so for Murasaki, whose spirited and honest nature exhibits remarkable mental development. Murasaki's psycholog- ical profile is developed in such a way that her final journey towards death re- veals the profound depths of human spirituality, readily accepted and intimately shared by the reader.

DAI 65, no.11 (May 2005): 4203-A; UM 3155558. Images of evil, scissors-wielding censors lurk in most narratives of literary and film history. Japan has had its own share of artists being persecuted by the official censors and their self-appointed minions. The brutal murders of prole- tariat writer Kobayashi Takiji by the police in 1933 and of the Japanese trans- lator of Salman Rushdie by a Muslim extremist in 1991 are perhaps the most notorious cases of this. Such incidents, and other less spectacular acts of censor- ship, are often cited to prove that art in modem Japan has been at the mercy of draconian censorship. This story fails to account for the complexity of the interactions between cen- 336</page><page sequence="107">Abstracts sor and artist. It depicts the censor as having the power to exercise a political or legal judgment on a work of art, and the artist as being able to respond only by being either admirably subversive or unscrupulously complicit. This approach reduces art to the status of mere political indicator used to gauge the ideological affiliations of artists. In other words, censorship has often been used to write po- litical, rather than artistic, history. In this dissertation, I examine literary and film censorship in Japan by focus- ing on the most celebrated censorship trials of the post World War II period. I organize my dissertation around the artistic issues raised in the trials to show how the trials influenced and were influenced by artistic theories of authorship and reception, as well as by the notions of aesthetic value that define a canon. I draw from the seven postwar censorship trials that were prosecuted under ob- scenity laws and reached the appellate courts, with particular focus on the precedent-setting trials of the translation of Lady Chatterley's Lover in the 1950s and on the 1970s trials of Oshima Nagisa's book version of his infamous film In the Realm of the Senses (Ai no koriida, 1976) and Nagai Kafi's story "Behind the papering of the four-and-a half mat room" ("Yojohan fusuma no shitabari", 1924). By considering how legal and artistic discourses often collided, but sometimes colluded, with one another in these trials, I illustrate the dynamic re- lationship of censor, artist, and text in modem Japanese literary and film history.

A microfiche copy may also be borrowed on interlibrary loan from Library and Archives Canada (formerly known as the the National Library of Canada) in Ottawa, using the ISBN number 0-494-10475-9. This dissertation examines and compares representations of female subjectiv- ity in selected literary texts by women writers from modem Japan and Taiwan. Particular attention is paid to narrative constructions of gender, race, and nation as these configure subjectivity. The use of a comparative framework of analysis provides a more nuanced understanding both of the specific authors addressed 337</page><page sequence="108">Japanese Language and Literature and the gendered nature of modem literary production in these two countries that share such a complex colonial and postcolonial history. The dissertation begins by situating the literary works addressed in the socio- histoncal context from which they emerged. The analysis of the literary works incorporates critical concepts and insights by postcolonial theorists such as Ga- yatri Spivak and Trinh T. Minh-Ha, as well as feminist and gender theorists such as H6lne Cixous and Luce Irigaray. The five critically-acclaimed women writers under discussion are Kanai Mi- eko, Enchi Fumiko, and Oba Minako from Japan, and Li Ang and Zhu Tianxin from Taiwan. In each chapter, one writer from Japan is paired with one from Taiwan according to the thematic similarities of their works. Themes that I have chosen for comparison include the female body, feminine sexuality, man- slaughtering, women's language, and geographic/temporal displacement. These themes appear frequently and conspicuously in the fiction of the most important female writers of postwar Japan and Taiwan, and as such they provide valuable points of entry for the critical exploration of identity issues of gender, race, and nation. Apart from the similarities of theme, structure and writing strategy, this com- parative study also explores the differences between Japanese and Taiwanese women's writing in the modem period. As Taiwan's complicated colonial his- tory differentiates its postcoloniality from that of Japan, national identity often emerges as a crucial issue in Taiwanese women's writing; this is less often the case in the work of Japanese women writers. My elucidation and discussion of these differences counters the Orientalist tendency to treat all non-Western countries as a homogenous block, on the erroneous assumption that there is one fundamental experience of coloniality that all colonized nations share. By exam- ining the residual influences of colonialism in postcolonial Japan and Taiwan, this dissertation contributes to the critical exploration/interrogation of the fea- tures of both extra-Asian and intra-Asian colonialisms in general, and their ef- fects on gendered literary production in particular.

Terayama Shiji (1935?-1983) was a poet and a playwright, a director of film and live-drama performance, and a popular critic of politics, horseracing, and 338</page><page sequence="109">Abstracts boxing. This dissertation explores the way that Terayama's work often rides the line between the confrontational aesthetic inversions of avant-gardism and the relative independence of modernism, as well as the line between modernist so- cial engagement and the playful pastiche associated with postmodernism. Simi- larly, by combining cultural forms--jazz and the novel or tanka and film--the projects offer space in which to explore relationships between genre delineation and the material properties of media. Terayama was especially interested in ex- ploiting culturally produced assumptions about genre and medium to magnify and then break an expectation. Consistent across nearly all of his projects are studies of the rhetorical production of truth-value, propositions for a fresh under- standing of fictionality, efforts to depolarize power structures, experiments in maximizing the sensation of presence, agitations for social revolution through sexual liberation, and demands that conceptually metonymic universalities be reconstituted to their full particularity. The core project might be described as a delimitation of fiction to the knowledge of not-knowing, but a not-knowing that forces motion rather than pause-a poetics of agnosticism against stasis. Draw- ing from his fixed-form poetry, political writings, radio dramas, theoretical essays on language, prose fiction, plays, and films, this dissertation works in roughly chronological order through Terayama's most significant work, distil- ling core problems and analyzing key texts.

Siseki and the Moral Imagination: Mon, Kokoro, and Michikusa. Yale Uni- versity [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. East Asian Languages and Literatures). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Edwin McClellan. 1, vi, 160p. DAI 66, no.3 (Sept. 2005): 1003-A; UM 3168873. This dissertation is a study of the moral imagination in three of the late novels of Natsume Sbseki (1867-1916): Mon (The Gate, 1910), Kokoro (The Heart, 1914), and Michikusa (Grass on the Wayside, 1915). Situating Sbseki's fictional project within the international literary movement of modernism, the dissertation advances an analytic of the moral imagination corresponding to the tradition of moral enquiry that includes Aristotle and Augustine. In modernity the reflective subject of interiority, which has traditionally been predicated on a teleological narrative of virtue, is divorced from the communities of moral reflection and in- struction necessary to sustain that interiority and avoid despair and meaning- lessness. Soseki's three late novels examine the attempts of the modemrn self of interiority to respond to a universe that is increasingly perceived either as indif- ferent, the empty universe of nihilism, or as hostile, the universe of gnosticism. Mon portrays the fall into modernity as an entrapment in a dialectic between the 339</page><page sequence="110">Japanese Language and Literature obligations of an ethical self, whose teleology is conceived in relation to the family, and the desire for release from the ironies of fate through the pursuit of sublime experience. Kokoro examines the possibilities of an ethical response to the mediation of desire and its engendering of the community of violence. In the savagely ironic cosmos of Michikusa, the protagonist Kenzo struggles for liter- ary creativity only to uncover, through his inability to escape the twin entrap- ments of history and the family, the gnosis of his true identity as a secret agent of death and sterility.

DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2935-A; UM 3186334. This dissertation examines the modem Japanese magazine My6jJ (Venus, 1900-1908). Mydj&amp;'s legacy endures as a repository of romanticism, poetry, visual art and late Meiji figures, including the poets Yosano Akiko and Ishikawa Takuboku and the artists Fujishima Takeji and Nagahara Shisui. Instead of look- ing at MyojJ as a source for individual movements, genres or historical figures, however, my study looks at Myj&amp; itself. By viewing Mydj6 as the literary and visual arts magazine (bungei bijutsu zasshi) that its editor Yosano Tekkan (Hi- roshi) and his group of collaborators collectively known as the Mydj5 group in- tended, my study explores the MydjJ group's mission to promote the arts, or geijutsu. As a composite product of the New Poetry Society (Shinshisha) and the western-style painting coterie White Horse Society (Hakubakai), My3j6 pro- posed self-cultivation in the arts in order to prevent what the Myj&amp; group per- ceived as the decline of Japanese civilization. The Mydj6 group's encourage- ment of the global exchange of arts, advocating cosmopolitanism, places it within the wider network of contemporaneous western arts magazines such as Jugend (Youth, 1895-1932). The intersection of Mydjd's diverse texts and images with late Meiji cultural discourse forms the basis of the chapters. The first chapter examines the Myoj&amp; group's response to the government's censorship of Mydj&amp;'s November 1900 publication of nudes within the context of the Meiji period Debate on Nudes (Rataiga rons&amp;) and from the perspective of the banning as a defining moment in the magazine's efforts to civilize the nation through the cultivation of indi- vidual taste (shumi). The second chapter looks at the Myj&amp; group's response to the public's preoccupation with the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), explor- ing the war as a rupture in the free pursuit of learning that threatened to under- 340</page><page sequence="111">Abstracts mine the Myj group's mission of self-cultivation in the arts. The third chapter addresses the individual and how the Myj group cultivated the individual as civic-minded artist to contribute to the civilization of Japan. Refusing to accom- modate the postwar rise of naturalism (shizenshugi) and its endorsement of the individual as severed from social obligation, Myj folded, having helped to institutionalize the arts in modern Japan.

This dissertation concerns the Buddhist sermonizing tradition in medieval Ja- pan. Focusing on setsuwa (exempla used in sermons to illustrate points of doc- trine), this study combines recent scholarship in the fields of performance stud- ies, medieval Christianity, Buddhist studies and anthropology to explore the body as a theatre of transformation and redemption. Chapters One and Two examine the history of setsuwa scholarship, tracing its origins in the romantic nationalism of European folklore studies. These chapters argue that studying setsuwa in terms of oral tradition is inadequate and needs to be tempered with a sensitivity to the rhetoric of medieval Buddhism and the performative nature of setsuwa texts. Material from two medieval sources a preaching manual and notations documenting a sermonizing event-are used to establish a liturgical template for situating temple-based sermonizing in approp- riate architectural, rhetorical, and ritual contexts. Chapters Three and Four continue the emphasis on the performance as an event while Chapters Five and Six delve much more deeply into questions of the text as text. Chapter Three focuses on the role of erotics in setsuwa, examining the ways in which arousal, the deferment of sexual gratification, and the threat of predation are used as metaphors for the awakening, development, and per- formance of religious devotion. Chapter Four centers on the violent marking of the human body, such that one's physical appearance may be read as a reflection of one's karmic standing. In addition, this chapter considers modern criticisms 341</page><page sequence="112">Japanese Language and Literature levied against medieval Buddhism by the Critical Buddhism movement, arguing that medieval writings encourage attitudes of penitence and self-examination rather than positing karma as an excuse for social injustice. Chapter Five exam- ines the literary trope of physical dismemberment in the context of meditations on the putrefaction of the human body after death, showing that setsuwa work to create an understanding of the human body itself as a potential text of Bud- dhism. Finally, Chapter Six concentrates on the significant overlap between de- scriptions of medieval technologies of chanting, memorizing, and copying su- tras, arguing that Buddhism treats the body, the mind, and the page as meta- phorically intertwined locations for the inscription of Buddhist texts.

This dissertation reevaluates the prewar fiction of Sati Haruo (1892-1964). As a poet, painter, essayist and novelist, Sate displayed a remarkable range of artistic ability. Previous scholarship in Japan has focused on the close relation- ship between Sati's personal life and his fiction. This study considers the close interaction between contemporaneous discourses and Satb's experiments with fantastic literature, melancholy, detective fiction and film, and his writing on co- lonial Taiwan. I combine close readings of texts with a broader exploration of the cultural and social issues of the Taish period (1912-1926). The study be- gins with a consideration of Satb's use of the fantastic as a response to literary naturalism. I then consider Sata's canonical works, which are closely identified with melancholy. Relating Sat's use of melancholy to contemporary discourses on mental illness, nerves and urbanization, I suggest that Sat6 used melancholy as a framework for exploring the nature of modernity. Furthermore, Sat's de- tective fiction is closely linked to the popular culture, particularly film, of his day. I examine the intersection of high and popular culture in Sati's detective fiction and discover a close symbiotic relationship between print and film and that Sat was a perceptive observer of the cinema. Finally, I consider SatO's colonial fiction based on a trip he took to Taiwan in 1920. Sat6's work begins as 342</page><page sequence="113">Abstracts an exotic escape to the colony but develops into a mature vision of civilization critique. The image of Sat that emerges is not one of an aesthetic escapist but rather one of a creative and ambivalent writer whose works incorporated many of the social and colonial contradictions of his time.

DAI 66, no.5 (Nov. 2005): 1776-A; UM 3175186. This dissertation explores the literary expression of infanticide and murderous mothers in the works of three women writers of the Shwa period: Hirabayashi Taiko (1905-1972), Enchi Fumiko (1905-1986), and Oba Minako (born in 1930). It surveys these issues within the context of the Shwa period (1926- 1989), which encompasses a broad range of events: the rise and fall of the left- wing in the 1920s and 30s, World War II and the Occupation that ensued in the aftermath of Japan's defeat, postwar reforms, political unrest in the 1960s, the consumerist boom of the seventies, and the rise of the economic bubble in the mid to late eighties. Sh6wa witnessed dramatic changes in women's rights, the family, and reproductive legislation, and it was both with and against these shift- ing ideological currents that these women writers attempted in various ways to write into existence new relationships between the maternal body and subjectiv- ity. Several of Hirabayashi's short stories of the late 1920s portray acts of infan- ticide that occur within the context of proletarian struggle; Enchi's postwar fic- tion scripts unseemly female protagonists who resist motherhood, and one work in particular contains an act of symbolic infanticide. And finally, Oba's stories of the yamanba (mountain witch) depict female characters who simultaneously harbor within them maternal instincts and infanticidal/homicidal urges, culmi- nating in one story in a paradoxical act of maternal suicide. A site often repre- sented as the locus of control and confinement for women, the maternal body in literature was transformed into a dynamic site of ideological interplay and ex- pression through acts such as infanticide or maternal suicide in their Sh6wa fic- tion. These writers demonstrate through maternal subjectivity that for many Shawa women writers, subjectivity was clearly defined as a process of becoming rather than a state of being. That is, rather than viewing the "subject" as an a 343</page><page sequence="114">Japanese Language and Literature priori existence, women authors tended to portray the process of becoming sub- jects-and in particular, of becoming female subjects. Indeed, for many women writers, the pathway to subjectivity was not without formidable obstacles, and was frequently portrayed as an unfinished journey.

The Heian poet-priest Nain (also called Tachibana no Nagayasu, 988-ca. 1052) was a wanderer who inspired many of his contemporaries and successors in his pursuit of the Way of Poetry (kadJ). In this dissertation, I present a study and translation of his entire extant poetic oeuvre, focusing especially on his per- sonal anthology (shikashli), Noin shii (also called Nain hoshi shi, ca.1046). My study situates Nbin's life and poetry in the context of the literary and social movements of his age, paying special attention to the politics, poetics, and po- tential of the shikashl genre. This study begins by arguing that Nbin's exploration of new possibilities for the shikashi genre has been obscured by an oppositional poetics which priv- ileges the established imperial waka anthologies (chokusenwakashi). Clearing this bias allows a reconsideration of the milieu and motives for Nain's creative goals and methods. In Part One of the dissertation, I consider the various contexts in which we encounter Nain and his work. In the first chapter, I approach Nain as a member of a particular social class, the zuryJ, a sub-elite who produced much of the lit- erary culture that has survived from the Heian era. Following the model of his life presented in N6in shi, I examine three of his relationships with fellow zuryJ poets and consider the significance of informal poetry groups outside the imper- ial court. In the second and third chapters, I introduce N6in as a poet and critic through his later poetry and two short prose pieces. In the fourth and fifth chap- ters, I address the core topic of my study: how to read Noin shi as an indepen- dent literary work and model for N~in's patrons and his disciples. Chapter Five offers an extended reading of the last fifth of the Nain shi, detailing the opera- tion of coherent and extended narrative in a work that appears at first to consist of multiple independent lyric poems. Part Two then presents a complete translation of Noin shii from the Matsu- 344</page><page sequence="115">Abstracts daira Manuscript, with textual commentary and annotation, allowing the reader to encounter N6in's story of his own life as he designed it to be read. I conclude by suggesting that N6in was not alone in innovating around the personal poetry collection form, and that a great deal of fundamental literary, rather than historical, analysis of the shikashi corpus is still needed before we can hope to understand the variety and potential of Heian and later waka poetry.

Harvard University [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Civilizations). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Jay Rubin. viii, 495p. DAI 66, no.11 (May 2006): 4028-A; UM 3194404. This dissertation studies the persistence of Chinese prose and poetry (kanshi- bun) in modem Japanese literature through a close examination of the works of Narushima Rythoku. It is part of a recent move to historicize traditional narra- tives of Japanese literary development that have tended to exclude Chinese texts from the canons of Japan's "national literature". Improved access to education in the early Meiji period in fact gave rise to an expanded population of kanshibun readers and to a proliferation of literary works, journals, and societies that devel- oped to meet their needs, yet Meiji kanshibun has tended to be seen as a mori- bund vestige of pre-modern culture. Such a view misrepresents what was in fact a much broader, dynamic, and adaptable medium. This dissertation demonstrates how kanshibun remained relevant to the literary figures of the Meiji period even as they showed a lively interest in the West and a commitment to Japan's mod- ernization. Ryuhoku is an ideal subject for such a study because he was deeply steeped in the Chinese literary tradition, uncommonly conversant with Western culture, and thoroughly engaged as a critic of contemporary Japanese society. The dissertation is organized chronologically, but each chapter also highlights a particular genre of kanshibun in which Ryuhoku wrote. The first two chapters consider his kanshi. Drawing on manuscripts and published anthologies, these chapters examine the compositional circumstances of kanshi, exchanges among kanshi poets, and the potential of kanshi as a medium of self-expression. The third chapter looks at Ryiuky shinshi ("New Chronicles of Yanagibashi"), dis- cussing it as an exemplar of the satirical texts known as hanjokimono ("chron- 345</page><page sequence="116">Japanese Language and Literature icles of urban prosperity") and situating it within the larger cluster of genres known as kanbun gesaku ("playful writings in Chinese"). The fourth chapter traces how kanshibun overseas travelogues facilitated the charting of new land- scapes as objects of knowledge and poetic expression. The final chapter con- siders Rytihoku's role as a journalist, both as a political commentator in the Chgya and Yomiuri newspapers, and as the publisher of Kagetsu shinshi, a pio- neering literary journal that created a forum for its readers' literary expressions in Chinese.

Japan annexed Korea in 1910, and governed the peninsula as a colony until 1945. The estimated 650,000 zainichi Koreans (literally, residing-in-Japan Kore- ans) in Japan today are one legacy of that period, and comprise Japan's largest minority. Continuing discrimination against the zainichi Korean minority at var- ious levels of Japanese society has meant that the historical, cultural, and social realities of the zainichi community present a genuine challenge to Japanese con- structions of nation, homogeneity, democracy, and legal justice. Many of these realities are reflected in the community's literary representations. Recognition of those same realties has dominated studies of the zainichi Korean community both inside and outside Japan, as well as discussion of zainichi Korean literature. While these facts and realities present the context and background to my dissertation, I deal here less with the "facts" of history than with the imagined, "translated" facts of the zainichi Korean community. For, in the words of Irish playwright Brian Friel, "it is not the literal past, the 'facts' of history, that shape us, but images of the past embodied in language..,. we must never cease renew- ing those images, because once we do, we fossilise" (Translations, 1981:66). My dissertation consequently looks towards the alternate provisional realities constructed through the literary process, through fictions of identity, the other, and gender. A particular focus on the intersections of gender and ethnicity in the 346</page><page sequence="117">Abstracts works of Ri Kaisei (born in 1935), Chong Ch'u-wol (bomrn in 1944), Yi Yang-ji (1955-1992), and Yui Miri (bomrn in 1968) highlights the process by which liter- ary realities once the sole property of zainichi Korean male writers were re- shaped by the zainichi Korean women writers who succeeded them. Throughout, I celebrate the work of the many writers from the diverse and changing zainichi Korean community who have struggled with the burden of responsibility pre- sented by their ethnicity, and have worked to reshape and re-conceive new forms of zainichi Korean expression and identity.

Chairperson/Ma- jor Adviser: James R. Reichert. vii, 217p. DAI 66, no.ll (May 2006): 4028-A; UM 3197435. This dissertation focuses on the construction of individual and communal identity in the fiction and criticism of Abe Kobo (1924-1993). I consider Abe's writings in their historical, intellectual and literary contexts in order to demon- strate how his texts function as explicit critiques of the subjugation of the indi- vidual by the community in the modemrn nation-state. I argue that three promi- nent tropes in Abe's works-the hometown, the frontier, and the city-are mobilized to objectify and criticize the assumptions upon which contemporary hierarchical communities are predicated, while positing the possibility of an au- tonomous mode of identity within the nation-state. The introduction examines Abe's position in the larger field of Japanese lit- erature as a so-called "international" writer. I assert that this label is a product of his rejection of conventional narratives of national cultural identity. Further- more, I assert that the categories of "national" and "international" are rendered meaningless by Abe's rejection of essentialized communal identity. The first chapter examines the concepts of the hometown and the border in relation to Owarishimichi no shirube ni (1948) and Kemonotachi wa kokyo o mezasu (1957). I demonstrate how Abe moves beyond early ideas of the border as a source of transcendental identity in order to embrace a more sophisticated and dialectical notion of the border capable of challenging national identity. The second chapter focuses on Abe's 1964 novel, Enomoto Buy6, and discusses the roles of loyalty and historical narrative in the construction of communal identity. I argue that Abe's text is not simply a rejection of a specific community but, through its rejection of loyalty, it constitutes a radical challenge to the assumed power of communities over the individual. The third and final chapter focuses 347</page><page sequence="118">Japanese Language and Literature on Moetsukita chizu (1967) as the last novel in this stage of Abe's career to an- alyze and deconstruct national identity. I argue that Moetsukita chizu presents an alternative to conventional notions of community by relativizing and destabil- izing ideologically interpellated notions of "self". The conclusion outlines the central ideas of the dissertation and relates them to Abe's later literary produc- tion. [Abstract on page iv of Gibeau's dissertation].

Strange Tidings from the Realm of Immortals: Hirata Atsutane's Ethnogra- phy of the Other World. Stanford University [United States], 2006 (Ph.D. in Religious Studies). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Carl W. Bielefeldt and Bernard Faure. x, 373p. DAI 67, no.2 (Aug. 2006): 373-A; UM 3209039. The nineteenth century Japanese nativist scholar Hirata Atsutane's work Sen- kyo ibun, or Strange Tidings from the Realm of Immortals, has been long misun- derstood. This dissertation starts by classifying the work as the proper object of religious studies. From there it identifies it as ethnographic fiction and subjects it to literary analysis to find important new meaning in the text. Hirata Atsutane (1776-1843) started recording his work Senkyo ibun in 1822. The message it was intended to deliver was ultimately no different than Atsu- tane's standard offering that he usually delivered through a textual medium. The import of the standard message was that the Japanese people are essentially dif- ferent and superior to all other human beings in the world. This case study ex- amines the packaging of that message in a new delivery system, as described in the text of Senkyo ibun. The key to the new system was a supernatural Shinto medium. This record of the whole exotic episode, where Atsutane performed as an emcee touting his sideshow Tengu Boy oddity, shows an elaborate presentation staged to introduce and give supernatural credence to Atsutane's own theological innovation called the sanjin (mountain man). This was to be the Shinto hero, holy man, and reli- gious medium who, by his own superior abilities, could show the Japanese peo- ple that they no longer needed to look outside of native Japanese culture-that is, to China, India, or the West-for a champion in whom they could take pride. This choice of a spiritual medium, however, had consequences for the redefi- nition of Japanese identity. The new medium ultimately suggested that the best signifiers of Japanese identity were not in the material world but rather lay in the spiritual world because the Japanese claim to originality in material culture was tenuous. Furthermore, close study of the sanjin shows just how reliant Atsu- tane's imaginary hero was on foreign precedents.

University of Hawaii at Manoa [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures: Japanese). Chair- person/Major Adviser: Arthur H. Thornhill (III). xiii, 289p. DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 4382-A; UM 3198357. This study centers on Zekkai Chtshin (1336-1405) and Gido Shushin (1325- 1388), along with their circle of disciples, including Gyokuen Bonpi (1348- after 1420), Seiin Shunjo (1358-1422), Isho Tokugan (1360-1437) and Kozei Rytha (1375-1446). Its focus is the Kitayama period between the late four- teenth century and first few decades of the fifteenth century, generally consid- ered the heyday of Five Mountains Literature (gozan bungaku). Examined in detail are the manifold ways in which Chinese literary aesthetics, philosophy and religion were syncretically assimilated into the writings of these medieval Japanese monks. Specifically analyzed is how the monks, drawing al- lusively from the Chinese tradition, conventionally produced a literature that often exhibits an "unconventional" aesthetic with undercurrents of dissent and discord. The prominent, influential monks chosen for this study formed "friends societies" that paradoxically advocated "anti-authoritarianism" while enjoying the patronage of the shogunate. The research attempts to explain why these elite monks, who not only associated with the highest political and cultural figures of their day (such as the Ashikaga shoguns and renga master Niji Yoshimoto), but also often themselves assumed positions of authority, wrote such "anti-authori- tarian" literature. It delineates the ways that unconventionality, forming part of a greater tradition within Muromachi society, became quite conventional. Also highlighted is the idealization by the gozan monks of aesthetic reclusion, and the inherent contradictions of an urban literature propounding the elegance of a life apart from mainstream society. Within the monks' writings, this "rhet- oric of reclusion", via the power attached to various secular, patrician Chinese traditions and paradigmatic eremitic models, is shown to reveal a search for the Way and the practical principles by which humans should live. Also demon- 349</page><page sequence="120">Japanese Language and Literature strated is how often this "rhetoric of reclusion" was a way for the monks to le- gitimize and rationalize their own power. Ultimately, this study illustrates that the ubiquity of eremitic models in the monks' writings suggests the frustrations that many felt in compromising their hermetic ideals. Conflict over their elite status contributed to the lyric power of their literature, which, with inherent religious value, champions withdrawal from the societal center for the purity of life on the periphery.

This dissertation innovatively juxtaposes East and West, ancient and modern, and multiple linguistic communities (i.e., Japanese, French, and English) in or- der to reveal connections that add to our knowledge of World Literature and the human condition. By closely examining liminality in women's writing from dis- crete literary traditions, we can observe a meaningful strategy for social com- ment and protest employed by a broad selection of authors. The careers of char- acters such as Ukifune in Genji monogatari by Murasaki Shikibu, Guilliadun in Eliduc by Marie de France, Lady Matilda in A Simple Story by Elizabeth Inch- bald, and Lily Bart in A House of Mirth by Edith Wharton all stage for the reader a dynamic process leading from marginalization to a form of qualified empowerment, via the paradoxical embodiment of the boundary. This line si- multaneously defines the rigid dichotomies that constrain their lives and rela- tionships with others and offers the promise of a "space of preparation" (Gaston Bachelard) for eventual subjectivity and agency. My heroines respond to the de- mands and perils of romance by living literally on the edge, creating a form of refuge and potentiality on, rather than behind or beyond, the limen itself. Whereas either side functions as a hostile "anti-space" (Elisabeth Bronfen), the threshold itself offers, if not "felicitous space" (Judith Fryer), at least the pos- sibility of manipulation and subversion. Anthropologists (Victor Witter Turner, Arnold van Gennep) have explained that the liminal primarily serves to rein- force the social structure, but nonetheless remains an unsettling stage of disrup- tion or even threatened destruction governable only by strict adherence to ritual. 350</page><page sequence="121">Abstracts The act of embodying and extending this normally transient phase allows intel- ligent, strong-willed heroines to protest their bounded bodies and speak the unspeakable. Employing a feminist critical stance, I demonstrate how certain women authors, despite obvious differences in their respective socio-cultural contexts, employ strikingly (dis)similar liminal images that act in a creative and revolutionary way to destabilize the prevalent centre/margin paradigm and thereby challenge gendered hierarchical practices based on a damaging imbal- ance of power.

This dissertation-a comparative analysis of Japanese and Taiwanese fiction during the period 1960-1990-is the first sustained attempt to read these two modem literatures together. Indeed, although comparative literature in general is a well-established field, the type of intra-regional enquiry conducted here-in which the field of comparison is limited to East Asia without using the West as the main point of reference-constitutes a departure from standard practice. The dissertation examines how aspects of modernity are represented in fiction from Japan and Taiwan during the later postwar period. It complements evidence drawn from other disciplines, and uses literature as a medium through which to show that the experience of modernity in these two societies differs from that of the West and elsewhere. In particular, the dissertation examines the relationship between fictional practice and state-sponsored programmes of modernity, and argues that the writers examined here adopt stances of anxiety, ambivalence or downright hostility towards an authoritarian establishment. The fictional worlds which these writers evoke consistently critique and subvert the "progressive" 351</page><page sequence="122">Japanese Language and Literature dominant discourse, and in the process create visions of modernity that are not just alternative but thoroughly dystopian. These dysfunctional worlds are viewed through the prism of two recurrent tropes, namely the city and sexuality. Their breadth of reference allows them to weave in and out of these fictional narratives in constantly changing guise. In fact, they function as the metaphorical matrix within which writers of quite varied stamp express their profound concern over the far-reaching changes which have transformed postwar Japan and Taiwan. This dissertation highlights three major aspects of modernity in these two coun- tries: American geopolitical and cultural hegemony in East Asia, the breakdown of the traditional family system, and the emergence of a commodified society. Each of these themes is analysed through recourse to a number of paradigmatic texts by a catholic range of writers. Cumulatively, these texts provide a repre- sentative cross-section of Japanese and Taiwanese fiction during the later post- war period, and demonstrate that these two literary cultures are animated by marked oppositionalist energies.

The aim of this thesis is to explore the representations of African Americans in modem Japanese literature. By investigating prewar and contemporary Japa- nese texts, one can paint a picture of the language, images, and symbols used to introduce and illustrate African Americans to Japanese society. In this respect, this thesis examines the works of three authors, namely, Abe Tomoji (1903- 1973), Yamada Eimi (bom in 1959), and Murakami Ryui (bom in 1952). Specifi- cally, Abe's "Shinema no kokujin" ("A Negro in Cinema", 1930), Yamada's Beddotaimu aizu ("Bedtime Eyes", 1985), Hizamazuite ashi o oname ("Kneel Down and Lick My Feet", 1988), "Otoko ga onna o aisuru toki" ("When a Man Loves a Woman", 1987), "Seijin muki mifu" ("X-Rated Blanket", 1988), Tora- shu ("Trash", 1996), and Murakami's Kagiri naku tomei ni chikai buriu ("Al- most Transparent Blue", 1976). Each of these authors has similarities in the fact that they were inspired to write about African Americans due to their specific experience(s) with them. Abe's infatuation with American cinema inspired him to construct a portrait of an African American filmstar, Stepin Fetchit (1892-1985). Yamada's principal involvement with African American servicemen stationed in Japan motivated her to write a collection of works illuminating certain aspects of African Ameri- can men. Murakami's living arrangements with African American GIs were in- fluential in his writing a novel about that period in his life. A common thread mirrored in the works of these authors is the sexuality of African American men. This research is organized in a manner to demonstrate the various levels in which sexuality is presented in modem Japanese literature. Chapter Two depicts the more subtle ways in which the sexual attraction of Af- rican American men was suggested in the 1930s. Chapter Three portrays explicit love obtained with African American men in the 1980s. Chapter Four illustrates the extreme perverse sexuality of African American men in the mid-1970s. Finally, the Appendix of this thesis presents three translations, namely, Abe's "Shinema no kokujin", and Yamada's Hizamazuite ashi o oname [excerpt] and "Koi no daichosasen" ("The Biggest Search Party for Love", 1988). The final translation is a comic strip. While this comic strip is not discussed in the body of the text, it provides a provocative insight into the ways in which Yamada has been perceived by the public due to her intimate relations with African Ameri- can men.

Realizing the Dramatic Potential of the Oratorio Chorus in Jeanne d'Arc au bicher by Paul Claudel and Arthur Honegger. University of Houston [United States], 2005 (D.M.A.. Moores School of Music). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Charles S. Hausmann. ix, 198p. DAI 66, no.3 (Sept. 2005): 812-A; UM 3167479. The first collaboration between French poet/playwright Paul Claudel (1868- 1955) and composer Arthur Honegger (1892-1955) resulted in a hybrid work of music theater that fell on the spectrum somewhere between opera, oratorio and the passion genres. Although the work was labeled a "dramatic oratorio" by its creators, Jeanne d'Arc au bacher (Joan of Arc at the Stake) (1935) is not rooted in the classical oratorio tradition. Instead, Claudel's search for a new kind of total theater led him to explore the possibilities of a drama wherein symbolic gesture was supported by music, and the manner of textual delivery ran the gamut from free speech to measured speech and full singing. He drew on his knowledge and personal experiences of theatrical traditions whose origins were remote in time and place. Three of these in particular came to have a demonstra- ble bearing on his theatrical oeuvre: early Greek drama, Japanese Noh theater, and the Medieval mystery play. Similarly, Claudel's theatrical use of the dra- matic entity known as the Chorus was based more on these ancient theater styles than on the traditional use of the chorus as it had evolved over the centuries in Europe. Unlike much standard oratorio literature where the chorus is relegated to an exclusively musical function, in Jeanne au bzcher it is assigned a dramatic role that is second to none other in the work. At times the chorus is the principal antagonist of the drama. Claudel's libretto and Honegger's score, however, yield only sketchy information on how the chorus should conduct itself onstage. This document explores the parameters and possibilities of integrating the oratorio chorus into the dramatic scenario in an immediate and visceral manner. Sugges- tions for stage movement, gesture and attitude are offered based on selected principles of Claudelian theater, and, to a lesser degree, the choral models of Greek drama, the mystery play and the Passions of Johann Sebastian Bach. Only with adequate and well-informed stage direction can the chorus uphold the weight of the dramatic burden placed upon it in this work. Logistical details are discussed, including the placement of performing forces, both musical and the- atrical. The public and critical reception of Jeanne au bacher has been sharply di- vided between Europe and the United States since its premibre in 1938. Based on critical reviews of productions given over the past six decades, this document evaluates the reasons for the lack of popularity which the work has suffered in the States. Directorial suggestions on making the work dramatically viable for contemporary audiences are made. [Abstract on pages iv-v of Keele's disserta- tion].

KEY, Margaret. In Pursuit of a New Realism: Detection and Documentary in Abe Koibo. Indi- ana University [United States], 2006 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cul- tures). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Edith L. Sarra. viii, 292, 2p. DAI 67, no.1 (July 2006): 302-A; UM 3204296. This dissertation examines the role of the documentary and detective genres in Abe Kiba's realist project of the 1950s and 1960s. Critics typically regard Abe (1924-1993) as writing against realism, due to his avant-garde aesthetics that challenged mainstream forms of realism. My analysis of a range of texts, includ- ing reportage, critical essays, fiction, television drama and theater, aims to show that an emphatically realist agenda was at the heart of Abe's life work. Under- lying his theory and practice of realism was a critique of conventional documen- tary and of the classic detective story, two genres that promise to deliver "the truth" based on an objective narrativization of the facts. Through representa- tional strategies that became increasingly self-conscious as his theory of realism evolved, Abe drew attention to the degree to which the documentarian and the detective are active fabricators of meaning, rather than neutral observers, and are foregrounded the cognitive processes by which we, detective-like, interpret the world around us. By undermining the epistemological foundations and aesthetic conventions of the two genres, Abe sought to reinvigorate literature's capacity for representing what is real. The self-conscious aesthetic of his work also cre- ated a critical space for metafictional ideas that were not yet acknowledged by the literary establishment of his time and have yet to be recognized by critics today. Although my primary concern is the way in which the texts critically engage in methodological and epistemological questions of artistic representation, I am also interested in the ethical aim behind Abe's efforts to develop a new form of realism. The documentary qualities of his writing, such as its valorization of ob- jectivity and its particular attention to the material and the concrete rather than the emotional and the abstract, are strategies for challenging the dominant as- sumptions about what constitutes good ethics and good art, as well as the rela- tionship between these two spheres.

The Figash (ca.1349) is the seventeenth of twenty-one imperially-sponsored poetry anthologies (chokusenshu). This anthology was compiled by the Kyi- goku school of poets who were aligned with the northern Jimyin branch of the imperial line. The poetry and the poets contained in the anthology as well as the arrangement of the anthology reflect the political standing and the poetic values of the Kyagoku poets. Many features of the Fgashi, such as the arrangement, the naming, and the inclusion of prefaces, reflect how important it was for the Kyagoku school com- pilers to distinguish their poetry from that of their rivals in the Niji school as the two schools sought legitimacy and support during this unstable period. Patron- age was essential to the livelihoods of the Ky~goku poets. The Kybgoku com- pilers had to be careful in their selection of poets and poems for inclusion in the anthology to reflect the poets and poetry that they respected. The Ky6goku style of poetry contains elements that distinguish it from the poetry of the Nijo school. The use of unusual vocabulary, unusual imagery and unusual phrases compared to those used by the Niji school helped to create an easily identifiable style of poetry that came to be known as the Kyagoku style of poetry. At the time of the presentation ceremony in 1346, the first book of spring po- ems was the only book completed. It was not for another year that any additional books would be completed. The first book of spring poems, therefore, was very important because it was the only indication of the compilers' intentions with regard to the poets and the poetry that were to be included in the anthology. The poems and the poets contained in the first book of spring poems reflect not only the political necessity of careful consideration when it came to organizing po- ems and poets, but also illustrate the Kyagoku style.

University of Iowa [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in History). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Stephen G. Vlastos. 2, viii, 211p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2359-A; UM 3179090. This dissertation explores Japanese-language Japanese American literature as a discourse of identity politics among Japanese Americans between 1936 and 1952. Shikaku, the first Japanese American translocal and multi-genre literary journal, published its inaugural issue in November of 1936, and 1952 marked the publication of Ibara aru shiramichi (Thorny path) by Asako Yamamoto, which was one of the earliest sustained literary accounts either in English or Japanese of the wartime experiences of Japanese Americans. One of the major goals of this dissertation is to uncover the muffled voices of Japanese Americans whose primary language was Japanese. I further scrutinize the ways in which Japanese Americans valued the tradition of English-Japanese bilingualism, and how bilingualism played a central role in the formation of Japanese American identity. From the 1930s through the Pacific War, when the relationship between Japan and the United States was the most hostile, and even after the war when Japan-U.S. relations changed dramatically, Japanese Americans felt acute pres- sures to suppress Japanese language and culture which had become associated with political sympathizers with Japan, the enemy, and therefore disloyalty to the U.S. Even under such intense pressure, however, bilingualism remained a critical tool for Japanese Americans to maintain and reconfigure their identity. They carefully guarded the tradition of biculturalism grounded in bilingualism in order to preserve a distinct identity against the intensified pressures of Ameri- canization with the emphasis on English-only monolingualism. The wartime political environment imposed a racially polarized discourse of American identity that singled out Japanese Americans as a disloyal group and gave a new impetus to Americanization programs. I argue that Japanese lan- guage literature provided writers protected space within which they engaged po- litically charged discussions on such topics as racialized and gendered politics of loyalty and the retention of biculturalism under the increasing pressure of Amer- icanization. After the war, as the issue of disloyalty receded, Japanese language literature acquired a new role as a critical resource for Japanese Americans to commemorate wartime experiences, and to rebuild cultural and psychological ties with Japan and Japanese culture.

DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2935-A; UM 3186686. This dissertation is a study of two Edo period narratives that circulated for over two hundred years and purport to tell of the arrival and expulsion of the Christian missionaries in Japan. Combining the results of archival research and an ideological analysis of representations of Japan and the Kirishitan as a West- ern "other" in the tales, the work employs a cultural studies approach to examine the place in Edo popular culture of Kirishitan monogatari (Tale of the Kirishi- tan), printed in 1639 and 1665, and Kirishitan shumon raicho jikki (Record of the Arrival of the Kirishitan Sect), which circulated in manuscript from the late seventeenth century until its first printing in 1868. A translation of the latter text is included in Appendix Two (pages 208-59). The first two chapters detail the startling results of archival research in twenty libraries in Japan, which reveal that over 150 extant copies of Kirishitan shzumon raich6 jikki exist under at least sixty-five different titles. They further trace the evolution of the tales from the earlier kanazoshi style to the laterjitsuroku style, and show the importance of the latter as a genre in which news of current events and other prohibited information circulated in manuscript form under the baku- fu's censorship radar. The analysis reveals that a crucial element in the success of this circulation was the phenomenon of the commercial lending library. The third chapter analyzes the representation of the so-called Kirishitan (Christians) in the tales as a discursive strategy that worked to allay the anxiety brought on by a new, more comprehensive understanding of Japan's place in the world and by the ever growing, unsettling presence of Western ships offshore. In the tales, the threatening Kirishitan demons and would-be conquerors are subjugated not only through their expulsion by Hideyoshi, but also in their representation as an exoticized but thoroughly domesticated "other". The fourth chapter examines the imagined geographies of the tales to show how they ignore new information about the world and instead remap Japan at the center of the traditional, sacred "three realms" cosmology, with the land of the Kirishitan representing the bar- baric peoples outside that realm.

Stanford University [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Asian Languages: Japanese). Chairperson/Major Adviser: James Reichert. x, 335p. DAI 66, no.1 (July 2005): 182-A; UM 3162357. In the early 1600s, Japan's nascent mass-publishing industry began churning out editions of literary classics, such as courtly romances, medieval didactic tracts, and collections of poetry that sometimes featured full-page woodblock illustrations in the style of their elaborately handcrafted forebears. By the end of the seventeenth century, an increasingly literate public was familiar not only with these works but also with parodies based on them. My dissertation focuses upon one such text, Inu hyakunin isshu (The Mock One Hundred Poets, 1669), an illustrated parody of Hyakunin isshu (The One Hundred Poets, One Poem Each, ca.1230), the famous anthology of classical poetry from the seventh cen- tury onward compiled by the courtier Fujiwara no Teika (1162-1241). The Mock Poets belonged to a venerable form of comic verse known as kyoka (sometimes translated as "madcap verse"). It established a trend for parodies of Teika's classic, which proliferated over the course of the Edo period (1600- 1868) and worked their influence on many areas of popular culture. My main argument is that The Mock Poets' brand of parody-both visual and verbal-was firmly rooted in the literature of the past and was a natural out- growth of classical aesthetics and centuries of comic poetry and narrative. The Mock Poets not only resulted from increased literacy but also contributed to a public discourse on how to "read" classical poetry. Heretofore, mid-seventeenth- century, word-for-word parodies of canonical texts have often been viewed in isolation-or as unworthy adjunct to serious poetic composition-and summar- ily dismissed as derivative and unimportant. I contend, however, that placed within the larger discursive context of seventeenth-century popular literature, The Mock Poets can be viewed as representing a sophisticated literary critique of Teika's text that incorporates social satire. Part One of my dissertation places The Mock Poets within the political, social and literary milieus of the seventeenth century, showing how the dissemination of classical literary texts, together with Neo-Confucian and other emerging forms of hermeneutic discourse, paved the way for alternative modes of inter- pretation; reflects the emerging "spatial consciousness" that came to dominate the cultural imaginary which remapped the classical association between poetic composition and place; constituted part of a broader process of reconstructing and deconstructing canonical texts within the context of public performance; ex- amines the discourse of satire and social commentary in kyka and comic story- 359</page><page sequence="130">Japanese Language and Literature books; and discusses the nature of parody within the context of late seventeenth- century and early eighteenth-century visual culture. Part Two presents my own annotated translations of both Teika's original an- thology and The Mock One Hundred Poets (the first ever complete translation of the latter). It also provides commentary explaining, on the one hand, the context of the honka (the source poems)-the occasion for which they were composed, varying interpretations over time, and visual representations-and on the other hand, the formal structure of the parody-the choice of subject matter, the de- gree to which it reflects interpretations of the honka, and visual and literary allu- sions. My translations endeavor to remain as literally faithful to the texts as pos- sible while reproducing (or compensating for) the puns and textual playfulness that are essential components of parody.

Manly Narratives: Writing Hokkaido into the Political and Cultural Land- scape of Imperial Japan. University of California at Irvine [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Literatures). Chairperson/Major Ad- viser: James A. Fujii. vii, 195p. DAI 66, no.6 (Dec. 2005): 2223-A; UM 3181261. This dissertation examines competing portrayals of "manliness" and "man- hood" set in or associated with Hokkaido which served to define not only the northern colony but also the Japanese nation as a whole, as various social, polit- ical, and cultural actors during the Meiji era responded to the continually chang- ing imperatives in the strategies of nation-building, imperial expansion and power-politics that emerged in relation to a threatening West. In the introduction, I challenge implicit and explicit denials of Hokkaido's co- lonial status, argue that Hokkaido played a significant role in the production of modem Japanese national institutions and ideology, and outline how the Meiji elite attempted to justify and naturalize an almost wholly new form of gov- 360</page><page sequence="131">Abstracts emment through proclamations that laid claim to and encouraged the settlement of Hokkaido. Chapter One considers the process by which Japanese military might was extended to the island through the stalwart bodies of state-sanctioned farming-soldiers (tondenhei) and interrogates tondenhei recruitment campaigns, military rescripts and soldiers' handbooks to understand how the appropriation of the samurai as a modem masculine icon was used to define and refine imper- ial ideology, promote colonial expansion and discipline an unseasoned and unre- liable modem military. Kunikida Doppo's (1871-1908) short story, "Sorachi- gawa no kishibe" ("The Shores of Sorachi River", 1902), the focus of Chapter Two, reveals the ways literary works reinforced the colonization of Hokkaido through depictions of "developing" a "blank slate" and portrayals of the manly "battles" of colonists subjugating Hokkaido's savage wilderness. Ultimately, such official and popular renderings belie both the oppression of Ainu com- munities under Meiji colonial law and the contestatory nature of the making of modern Japan. Hara Hoitsuan's (1866-1904) Anchii seijika (The Secret Politician, 1890), treated in Chapter Three, however, highlights the material and corporeal prac- tices involved in the Meiji state's attempts to discipline and unify the Japanese population. In narrating the plight of ordinary farmers imprisoned in the harsh shi/ikan prison system in Hokkaido for their involvement in a peasant protest, this work suppresses traditionally accepted male-male sexuality at the same time that it strategically celebrates male-male love bonds in order to challenge an in- different, morally bankrupt government.

My dissertation explores the links between Kawabata Yasunari's (1899- 1972) modernist techniques in his masterpiece Snow Country (Yukiguni) and wartime Japanese political and social processes. While the dominant reading has 361</page><page sequence="132">Japanese Language and Literature seen the novel as a purely literary evocation of traditional Japanese beauty, I approach it as an ambitious experiment by a central player in Japan's literary world that juxtaposed modernism, imperialism, and patriarchal ideology. I look at textual forms and strategies as well as cultural and socio-historical contexts to show that the war was what allowed Snow Country to achieve its modernist aes- theticization of imperialist politics. In so doing, I challenge the assumption that the modem Japanese classic is apolitical and show how it is complicit with var- ious forms of nationalism, discrimination, and exploitation. The first chapter sketches my approach and methodology, a combination of textual analysis and socio-historical examination. I argue that the novel, written from 1934 to 1948, is not a mere literary celebration of traditional Japanese beauty, but rather a modernist experiment during wartime that encouraged people to identify emo- tionally with the nation and to forget its violent legacy. The second chapter ex- amines the creation of the geisha heroine by looking at textual constructs and strategies as well as literary debates and social changes in the period from 1934 to 1937. I explore how the geisha is transformed from a sexual laborer and com- modity into a symbol of imperial Japan. In the final chapter, I examine the last twenty pages, added in the 1940s to encode a rapidly changing war situation. Here the text is suddenly overtaken by the admiration of quintessential female productivity in the village community; the geisha is relegated to the side stage. Throughout, I attempt to dismantle Snow Country's masquerade as a willed em- bodiment of quintessential Japanese aesthetics, showing how it contributes to the production of a "national culture" at the time of mobilization for total war.

The misnomer that satire is lacking in Japanese literature stems from consider- ing satire as a genre. When satire is seen as a mode which operates parasitically on various host structures, however, numerous satirical works can be found. The term host structure is employed instead of genre because of the uncertainties and unreliability associated with genre studies in Japan. Hence, a definition for each host structure is established at the start of each chapter. The way in which the features of the host structure and the writer's own characteristics function in the process of conveying satire is looked at. The writers chosen for this study are Miyazawa Kenji, Tsutsui Yasutaka, Hoshi Shinichi, Kurahashi Yumiko, Shimizu Yoshinori, and Dazai Osamu. They are categorized in various chapters under relevant host structures. Miyazawa is categorized under the children's animal story host structure; Tsutsui and Hoshi under science fiction; Kurahashi under fantasy; Shimizu under pastiche; and three writers, Dazai Osamu, Kurahashi Yumiko and Shimizu Yoshinori, are grouped under folk tales. Each chapter includes translations of works by the au- thors that have never been previously translated. These translations support the text analysis and initiate the reader's response. The dissertation initiates the identification of satire in works that are not normally associated with it. There- fore, in the future, satire may be seen as a more versatile entity that can be ac- commodated by a multitude of host structures. [Abstract on pages iv-v of Ma- tsushima's dissertation].

This dissertation examines the practice of cross-gender casting in theater, pay- ing particular attention to female actors playing male characters. Women have been acting in nominally men's roles consistently since before the formally rec- ognized beginnings of theater and they have done so in nearly every region of the world. In investigating a variety of circumstances under which it has hap- pened, the study establishes a set of models for viewing different forms of 363</page><page sequence="134">Japanese Language and Literature female-to-male theatrical transvestism and cross-gender performance. When sit- uated within their own cultural and historical context, these moments and the responses to them provide valuable information about how the most funda- mental and powerful of rhetorical categories, man and woman, have evolved. Chapter One examines the most enduring of documented performances whereby groups of women--whether professional or amateur--act both the men's and the women's parts in their theatrical productions. Surveying a broad array of in- stances-Sanskrit dramas, Okuni Kabuki, convent theaters, women's colleges, the Takarazuka Revue, and recent feminist and queer experiments-the chapter establishes a narrative of occurrence, sanction, and often near-erasure from the historical record. Chapter Two focuses on three nineteenth-century actors--Ma- dame Vestris, Charlotte Cushman, and Sarah Bernhardt. Their successful careers embody divergent methods of representing maleness, masculinity and feminin- ity, and highlight an increased awareness of and reckoning with the changing status of women in post-Industrial societies. Chapter Three looks at solo per- formers like Anna Deavere Smith, Lily Tomlin, Carmelita Tropicana, and Marga Gomez as examples of how women in the late twentieth century have deployed humor, familial dynamics, and racial and ethnic difference in their representations of men to establish authority and agency in their stage acts. Chapter Four investigates critical responses to Ally Sheedy's casting in the title role of Hedwig, a gender-ambiguous character previously played by men. Chap- ter Five uses productions of plays by Kate Bornstein, Keith Curran, and David Harrison to explore the complications that arise when casting transsexual char- acters undergoing the sex-reassignment process. The conclusion speculates on the future of women in cross-gender performance, drawing particular note of the concurrent productions of Matt and Ben and Peggy Shaw's To My Chagrin in 2004.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Anne Sokolsky. iv, 83p. Master's Abstracts International 44, no.3 (June 2006): 1151; UM 1430398. End6 Shisaku (1923-1996), a renowned Japanese novelist and a committed Catholic, produced numerous works of fiction and essays. Many of them deal with his struggle between the cultural heritage of the polytheistic Japanese envi- ronment and the strictness of Catholic monotheism. Furthermore, the morality which Catholicism imposed upon him often ran contrary to his beliefs, as a 364</page><page sequence="135">Abstracts writer, of depicting human nature and the mind truthfully. Enda, however, found a way to harmonize these conflicting elements and established his own philoso- phy. In this thesis, I examine the way that Endb developed his philosophy by analyzing some of his essays and two representative works of fiction, Chinmoku (Silence) (1966) and DTpu Riba (Deep River) (1993). Clearly, Enda's philoso- phy regarding literature was formed early in his life and remained consistent while his notion of religion evolved as his experience grew and his perspectives changed.

This dissertation analyzes contemporary literary attempts by Western and Japanese writers to defy patriarchal control over the female body. Situating the female body through myth, religion, and various forms of art as "grotesque" is Western culture's means of control over nature. In contrast to this, Japanese cul- ture originally had more harmonious concepts of the mind and body, but was transformed into a pattern similar to that of the West. During the period of Ja- pan's cultural transformation, one example of literary resistance by women writ- ers appeared as the Tale ofGenji (Genji monogatari), arguably the first novel in the world, which uses an ambiguous narrative method and the concept of the grotesque body. Contemporary women's writings still employ similar strategies, though they are more direct and effective. From the beginning of the twentieth century and through the development of consumer society, more bodies are re- garded as "grotesque" but there are also cultural exchanges in the world which seek to subvert such tendencies. Despite unmistakable cultural differences be- tween Western and Japanese representations, they often influence each other and draw upon similar strategies. Both use the motif of the grotesque body to create a reverse discourse, and to re-situate the body, as the symbol of the retrieval of a "natural" and sexual body which is found in Japanese myth. English and Japa- nese women writers also maneuver to strike a balance between fantastic and more conventional narrative modes. Though the majority of Japanese writers are still working within a broadly realistic mode, the writers who are analysed here use fantastic mode as a weapon of formal and ideological subversion. These 365</page><page sequence="136">Japanese Language and Literature writers include Angela Carter (who lived in Japan), Margaret Atwood, Fay Wel- don, Muriel Spark, Matsumoto Yuko, Matsuura Rieko, Shono Yoriko, and Ku- rahashi Yumiko.

DAI 66, no.12 (June 2006): 4380- A; UM 3197719. My dissertation explores the nature of "Okinawan literature" by focusing on Oshiro Tatsuhiro (born in 1925), an important contemporary writer from Oki- nawa. By investigating continuities and changes in the thematic concerns as well as in the narratives of Oshiro's major fiction, I demonstrate that Oshiro's literary works have been shaped by his consciousness of Okinawan culture-its his- torical heritage, indigenous beliefs, and everyday life-and by his quest for Okinawan literary identity. Chapter One analyzes the narrative structure of Kakuteru pdat (Cocktail Party, 1967) to show the ways in which Oshiro narrates Okinawan history and identity, and to demonstrate that intertextuality in this novella creates a new historical narrative about Okinawa. Chapter Two exam- ines the nexus linking literary prizes and Okinawan fiction in order to explore the site in which Okinawan literature is generated. In this chapter I deploy the concept of "minor literature" proposed by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari in order to capture the possibilities of Okinawan literature. Chapter Three analyzes Oshiro's important religious stories to demonstrate how Oshiro depicts the con- nection between Okinawan religion and identity in his literary works. Chapter Four consists of a close reading of Hi no hate kara (From the End of the Day, 1993), a work which directly depicts the Battle of Okinawa. In this chapter I analyze Oshiro's attempts to narrate a war that has heavily and deeply affected Okinawan history and society. As an appendix, I include my translation into English of Oshiro's Meiro (The Labyrinth, 1991), a story about an Okinawan yuta (female medium). Since he became the first Okinawan writer to win the Akutagawa Prize in 1967 for his novella Kakuteru pdtT, Oshiro has played a vital role in the Okinawan literary scene. Okinawan identity as a literary theme runs through his works. He attempts to establish an Okinawan literary identity within the site of Japanese literature. Oshiro's major contribution to Okinawan liter- 366</page><page sequence="137">Abstracts ature is threefold: he has presented various literary themes ranging from the American occupation in Okinawa to Okinawan religion; he has attempted to create a new narrative of Okinawan history; and he has explored the problem of language-in oral and written forms-in Okinawa.

MUKAI, Kohei. "Mugen" for Orchestra [Original Composition]. University of Missouri at Kansas City [United States], 2005 (D.M.A. in Music Composition, Conservatory of Music). Chairperson/Major Adviser: James Mobberley. viii, 62p. DAI 66, no.4 (Oct. 2005): 1210-A; UM 3170671. Mugen is an orchestral work with a significantly extended expression of mu- sical tension, based on traditional Japanese ghost stories, concepts of time and form from the Noh drama, and dramatic effects of the Kabuki theater. It is also an application of a re-creation of the timbre of Japanese traditional instruments using a Western orchestra. The translation of the title Mugen is "Dreams-Illusions-Phantasms", which implies a "surrealistic sense". The term comes from Mugen Noh, a genre of Noh which appears in opposition to Genjitsu Noh, or "Reality Noh". In Mugen Noh, the protagonist is normally a person who does not exist (an archetype in the mythical sense), or is from the past. The term particularly specifies that the story is not about the real world. Noh drama is extremely abstract in its expression. The concept of time is stretched, hence the extremely high tension of the atmo- sphere is maintained longer than in Western drama. The characteristic physical gestures and the sense of expanded breathing might be described as a floating quality between reality and the supernatural, an alternate dimension or another world. The unique structure of Noh features principal scenes as extended mono- logues, while other shorter story scenes function as introductions or interludes. I applied this concept of structure to Mugen, which consists of several long monologue-like sections interspersed with fast-changing sections. The mono- logues have the character of a solo performance, but they are actually expressed by the blending of many instruments using techniques of timbral orchestration. Solo shakuhachi (Japanese bamboo flute) and gong sounds are the inspiration for orchestral timbres that recreate and augment them. Careful listening and some filtering of the original sounds were used both to isolate specific compo- 367</page><page sequence="138">Japanese Language and Literature nent tones (fundamental and partials) and to suggest specific orchestral instru- ments that would be most effective in the recreation process. In contrast to Noh's restrained and abstract expression, the secular Kabuki theater has very dramatic effects, and uses sound effects which suggest partic- ular phenomena or incidents. In Mugen, sound effects suggesting the appearance of ghosts or the suggestion of death are applied to the interspersing fast- changing sections. [Abstract on pages ii-iv of Mukai's dissertation].

Writing as Response and as Translation: Jiandeng xinhua and the Evolution of the Chuanqi Genre in East Asia, Particularly in Vietnam. Harvard Univer- sity [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Civilizations). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Patrick Hanan. 2, v, 607p. DAI 66, no.5 (Nov. 2005): 1776-A; UM 3174100. This dissertation begins with a study of Jiandeng xinhua (New Tales Told Be- side the Trimmed Lamp), a collection of tales of the extraordinary written in classical Chinese by the Ming period writer Qu You (1347-1433). Jiandeng xin- hua is examined here as Qu's literary response to his predecessors' works. The dissertation also scrutinizes the dissemination of Qu You's collection to Korea, Vietnam, and Japan and its adaptations in these countries. While it concentrates on the specific case of Vietnam, the theoretical issues are discussed from a broader comparative perspective, drawing on examples from across East Asian literature. For non-Chinese writers, to write in classical Chinese was to write in a second language, and the analysis of their works requires special consider- ation. The position I take is that these non-Chinese authors were placed in the position of having to do their writing "as translation". From this vantage point, this dissertation explores various aspects of the non-Chinese writers who chose to publish their works in classical Chinese. The dissertation examines the introduction of chuanqi literature into Vietnam in the fifteenth century through the tale "Viet Tinh" (The Well of Viet). The col- lection Truyen Ky Man Luc (Tales of the Strange Casually Recorded) by the sixteenth-century Vietnamese writer Nguyen Tu provides us with an interesting example of how Jiandeng xinhua was adapted and reworked in Vietnam. Com- posed in classical Chinese, Jiandeng xinhua and Truyen Ky Man Luc may both be regarded as fictionalized discussions of the contemporary concerns of intel- lectuals in distinct cultural and historical contexts. Yet this consideration may also be taken further: based on an intertextual approach, on reception theory, and also on examples from these two collections, the dissertation emphasizes the au- thors' role as readers of their predecessors' literary works and as authors and "translators" who, basing themselves on these readings and their own cultural contexts, also had to perform the task of "filling the gaps" left in their pre- 368</page><page sequence="139">Abstracts decessors' literary works. We may reconstruct a kind of dialogue between chuanqi writers from different times and places. Seven tales by Chinese and Vietnamese writers are translated, extensively annotated, and examined to show how the literati in different countries responded to one another across temporal, spatial, and cultural distances. When rewriting chuanqi tales by their Chinese counterparts, Vietnamese chuanqi writers, on the basis of their own belief systems, typically localized various elements of the original Chinese tales, particularly those having to do with religious belief. This religious localization is illustrated here by several ex- amples taken from Truyen Ky Man Luc and other chuanqi tales in Vietnam. The tales "The General of the Yaksa" and "The Lady from Nam Xumng" in Truyen Ky Man Luc plus supporting evidence from study in the field demonstrate how Vietnamese popular beliefs-specifically, the cults of Van Di Thanh and Prin- cess Vu-were developed on the basis of chuanqi tales. The historical back- ground, the religious and intellectual interdependence of the three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism), and the diplomatic relationship be- tween China and Vietnam at the time when Truyen Ky Man Luc was composed, are also discussed in detail. When examined in transnational, cross-cultural and trans-generational contexts, chuanqi tales of the two collections provide insights into the socio-political, intellectual, literary, and religious interactions between China and Vietnam.

In this thesis, I set out to investigate assumptions about gender that derive from a social role theory; to consider the historical and social forces that help shape the performances of Kabuki and Takarazuka in Japan and of drag queens and kings in the West; to apply what is learned to the cross-gender performances by means of a critical semiotic framework including performance and gender 369</page><page sequence="140">Japanese Language and Literature codes; to re-evaluate these performances in light of the above analysis; and fi- nally, to compare how gender is manipulated in both Japanese and western per- formances. Because there is little substantiation of formal acting techniques of any of the cross-gender performers examined, social role theory created a struc- ture that could be applied to all of the performances. My intent was to look be- yond the obvious and the stereotypes to deconstruct and reconfigure gender that would eventually lead to an adjustment of established notions of gender.

Columbia University [United States], 2003 (Ph.D. in East Asian Languages and Cultures). Chairperson/Major Adviser: Carol N. Gluck. 2, ii, 218p. DAI 64, no.4 (Oct. 2003): 1369-A; UM 3088396. This dissertation explores the emergence of "custom" (fuzoku) as a fundamen- tal category of knowledge about social life in Japan during the Meiji period (1868-1912). Whether characterized as an obstacle to the nation's development or as the true source of its progress, customs came to figure prominently in late nineteenth-century understandings of Japan's past, present, and future. This dis- sertation investigates how the new national police force, kabuki artists and the- ater modernizers, historians, and reform activists struggled to define and shape social practices designated as fiizoku, such as hairstyles and clothing, in the ser- vice of "civilization" and "enlightenment", the twin goals of Meiji Japan. As a result of these endeavors, "custom" came to play a pivotal role in broader Japa- nese efforts to create a modem nation and preserve its autonomy in the face of Euro-American imperialism. This approach to fizoku calls into question its status as a simply descriptive or taxonomic term and foregrounds what it does for those who have taken it up be- fore, during and since the Meiji period. From this perspective, the preoccupation of a variety of groups and institutions with describing and influencing "custom" can be recognized as a strategy that aimed as much at staking out a space of au- thority for its self-appointed guardians as it did at actually affecting social prac- tices. Neither the concern with "custom" nor the salience of that category to un- derstandings of nationhood was unique to Japan. In an era of frenzied nation- building and expanding empires, daily life came under intense new forms of scrutiny the world over in the nineteenth century. More recently, "everyday life" has become a crucial field of inquiry for those seeking to grasp the social history of modem nation and empire-building. This study seeks to illustrate how dis- course on fizoku has shaped both social practices and understandings of Japan's 370</page><page sequence="141">Abstracts modem transformation, and speaks to the larger transnational history of how such categories as "custom" or "everyday life" can be seen as contributing to the unfolding of modernity rather than merely registering its material effects.

Manga (Japanese comics) and anime (Japanese animation, also called Japani- mation) have become a standard part of American comic book culture during the past two decades. The works of Tezuka Osamu (1928-1989), often referred to as the Manga no kamisama ("God of manga") or the inventor of modem manga, however, have only recently begun to be translated into English. Tezuka is known for his long, plot-driven graphic novels with dynamic panel layout. He produced over 150,000 pages of comics in his lifetime, consistently working as one of the top cartoonists in Japan. As the first full-length study of Tezuka's works in the English language, this dissertation investigates Tezuka's works in relation to their cultural, social and political climate. Situated in the era of rapid industrialization and cultural importation, Tezuka's works serve as an ideal site of investigation for theories of intertextuality, parody, theatricality, performa- tivity, as well as inter-media and intercultural adaptation. The influences that shaped Tezuka's works are complex, based on his knowl- edge of film, theatre and other media. Tezuka's comic images often allude to specific innovations in film technology in the postwar era, such as deep focus cinematography. His application of the Hollywood Star System introduced the dynamics of celebrity acting and character-actor separation. Borrowed themes and genres from popular films reveal the changing status of domestic and im- ported (particularly American) films in twentieth century Japanese popular cul- ture. Tezuka often quoted images from theatre productions of an all-female revue company, Takarazuka Kagekidan (founded in 1913), which is known for its extravagant scenery, costumes, and performances by its flamboyant female-to- 371</page><page sequence="142">Japanese Language and Literature male impersonators. The theatre company's rigorous training system, male- dominated administration, as well as its public performance of gender and hier- archy also make their way into Tezuka's comics, mostly in the form of his cross- dressed heroines. The images of the Orientalized Middle East, auto-Orientalized Japan, as well as romanticized West, all of which serve as staples on Takarazuka stage (often adapted from French revue), were also translated into Tezuka's comics. Manga is a hybrid art form, and Tezuka is not so much a "God of manga" who created the genre from nothingness, but rather a multidisciplinary artist who freely borrowed vocabularies from various art forms to transform his medium. Tezuka's works served as self-conscious, multi-layered parody of Japan's post- war era, capturing, representing and re-performing its cultural and ideological shifts.

Examining German and Japanese literature and literary criticism, this disser- tation argues that the notion of national identity prior to the Second World War in both countries shared features of the discourse on German Geist, which gave their ultra nationalistic campaigns a similarly skewed logic. Setting the scene, the first chapter discusses the German and Japanese search in the early twentieth century for national identities based on their respective cultural traditions and the resulting rejection of foreign creeds. The second chapter, then, recalls the discovery of a German linguistic past and notions of national identity in the Grimms' fairy tales and their work on Germanic mythology. Geist was becom- ing a conceptual metaphor for a German community without a political identity. While such ancient forms of German as Old High German only knew Geist as a creature outside of the human body, by the nineteenth century it had become something akin to the human "mind", "spirit", or "life force". Without such a turn in usage, German students who burned books of so-called un-German Geist in 1933 would never have been able to make sense of their own deed. Chapter three analyzes E. T. A. Hoffmann's usage of Geist as a thing similar to the Seele (soul), relating these usages to religion and early ideas on Seelen- kunde (psychology), as well as to Sigmund Freud's theories in the early twen- 372</page><page sequence="143">Abstracts tieth century. Chapter four examines the writings of Hermann Hesse, which placed him oddly between the Nazis and the exiles, and his considerations on the role of German Geist in the creation of a "German" personality with connections to both the European West and the Asian East. Finally, chapter five (pages 166- 248) treats Japanese borrowings from European literature, especially from the German tradition, and Japan's attempt to distinguish itself from both Asia and Europe. In the effort, writers such as Nitobe Inazi sought to describe for a West- ern audience Japan's essence, or soul. Similarly, authors such as Mori Ogai and Tanizaki Jun'ichiro left their own take on the new Japanese personality and its connection to a German tradition, making Japanese spirit a concept much like German Geist.

The main focus of this dissertation is its delineation of the paradigm of post- war Japanese literature. This is achieved primarily through an examination of the fiction of Oe Kenzaburo. The dissertation focuses on seven quintessential notions of literary criticism and their application in postwar Japanese fiction. These are in order of the thesis chapters: An examination of the term "postwar itself" (Chapter One), the idea of the "nation" in the newly emerging postwar society (Chapter Two), the notion of "exile" with its ramifications of marginality and diasporas (Chapter Three), the emergence of "alterity" in the postwar Japa- nese geography (Chapter Four), the implications of "history" (Chapter Five), the imagery of the "grotesque" (Chapter Six), and finally the mode of "modernity" (Chapter Seven). Throughout the dissertation, the analysis of the aforementioned keywords is undertaken through their reflections in the literature of the postwar period with specific reference to the corpus of Oe Kenzabur6's literature. The dissertation includes a thorough investigation of the changing modes of litera- ture throughout the postwar literary paradigm. The fiction of Oe Kenzaburo as one of the main representatives of postwar literature is compared with that of Ooka Shohei, Kawabata Yasunari and Abe Kobo in order to establish the dif- ference to the prewar tradition as well as other literary trends prevalent in the postwar paradigm.

This dissertation analyzes postwar fantastic literatures of the United States and Japan, focusing on the science fiction genre. Through comparisons of fan- tastic texts from the U.S. and Japan, it examines how postwar Japanese society has formed popular fantastic narratives with backgrounds of war, industrializa- tion, computerization, and postmodernism, and how writers have strategically employed this rhetoric of fantasy and science fiction to express the limits and possibilities of gender and ethnicity that bound their social roles and writings. The dissertation's overall argument is developed in three steps. First, I ques- tion the concept of "Japanese science fiction" as a genre, and by briefly exam- ining Oguri Mushitari's Kokushikan satsujin jiken [Murder at Black Death Mansion] and Yumeno Kytisaku's Dogura magura [Dogra Magra], I propose to reconfigure popular fantastic fiction as texts that seek Japanese identity in the creative failures to imitate authentic Western models of detective fiction and sci- ence fiction. Second, by analyzing postwar fantastic narratives that shed light on Japan's war memories, such as Numa Shbzb's Kachikujin Yapii [Yapoo, the Human Cattle], Komatsu Sakya's time parallel stories, and Miyabe Miyuki's Gamotei jiken [The Gamo Mansion Case], I suggest that the tropes of science fiction assumed in Western theories are often reversed and used for opposite effects in postwar Japanese science fiction. Lastly, I focus on gender issues in science fiction novels and shijo manga (visual novels for girls) by examining issues of androgyny and reproduction in science fiction texts by Hagio Moto, Takemiya Keiko and Ohara Mariko, in comparison to texts by Ursula Le Guin and James Tiptree, Jr. I then question gender and ethnic identity in Japanese cy- berpunk texts such as Noa Azusa's Baberu no kaori [The Flower ofBabel] and Kanbayashi Chohei's Sent6yosei Yukikaze [Battle Fairy Yukikaze]. These com- parisons demonstrate that philosophies of liberation and subversion embedded in, or applied to, American science fiction are often employed in Japanese sci- 374</page><page sequence="145">Abstracts ence fiction for different, or opposite, effects. The fantastic texts that "fail" to emulate authentic Western models have actively constructed postwar Japanese identity by inventing new tropes of fantasy and thereby re-imagining the locus of Japanese uniqueness.

No published abstract. Contact Mur- doch University Library (Perth, Western Australia) for information regarding the availability of copies (call number 883.59 M9739S). Over the past few decades, Murakami Haruki has emerged as one of the most significant literary figures in Japan. Having produced some eighty-six original works and translations, he has recast the format of the novel, reformulated the parameters of contemporary literary style, and ventured into non-fiction writing and social commentary. He is now a thoroughly "globalized" writer, with works translated into ten languages. While much of the critical literature on Murakami in Japanese has recently become more sophisticated, critiques in English have remained largely bound to the conventional analyses applied to earlier forms of modem Japanese fiction. In particular, the nexus in Murakami's writing between modernity, subjectivity and representation has been poorly theorized. This dissertation offers a new approach to dealing with Murakami's radical narrative project by demonstrating how his first and later trilogies utilize the structure of the simulacrum, a second-order representation, to develop a critique of contemporary Japanese culture. After outlining the critical-fictional contours of the "Murakami Phenomenon", the discussion addresses the vexed question of Japanese modernity within the context of the national-cultural imaginary, glob- alized artistic discourses, and the idea of the Japanese novel. Some competing perspectives on the theory of the simulacrum then are presented as a way of demonstrating the wide applicability of a syncretic model of the simulacrum. Murakami's first trilogy is analyzed in terms of its use of the tropes of parody, pastiche, metafiction, allegory and "landscape"--all of which are shown to be modalities of the simulacrum. Indicating a tentative "return" of the referent, the 375</page><page sequence="146">Japanese Language and Literature second and much later trilogy is investigated in terms of the way in which it uses the structure of the simulacrum to problematize the distinction between the dis- courses of "fiction" and "history" via the aesthetic modalities of the sublime. The dissertation concludes by demonstrating that within the context of current media-entertainment technologies and the competing discursive regimes of con- temporary Japanese culture, Murakami's destabilization of hitherto clearly de- fined genres of writing is also indicative of a new politics of representation, the limits of which have only just begun to emerge.

Optical Allusions: Screens, Painting, and Poetry in Heian and Kamakura Ja- pan. University of California at Berkeley [United States], 2005 (Ph.D. in Japa- nese Language). Chairperson/Major Adviser: H. Mack Horton. 3, vi, 289p. DAI 66, no.8 (Feb. 2006): 2935-A; UM 3187157. The interrelationship between screens, painting, and poetry provides a fertile ground for analyzing the ways that poets of Heian (794-1185) and Kamakura Japan (1185-1333) negotiated and established the very aesthetics and conven- tions upon which classical literature is based. This dissertation examines this in- terrelationship on several levels. Chapter One narrates the early history of screens and screen poetry in Japan, beginning with compositions in Chinese based on Tang Dynasty (618-907) poem-painting models. In addition to discussing the physical nature of painted screens within their architectural contexts, the chapter also includes an account of the earliest word-image relationships and the variety of approaches taken by screen poets in the years leading up to the compilation of the first imperial an- thology of Japanese verse, Kokinshi, in 905. Chapter Two focuses on poetic practices, issues of rhetoric and perspective, and the role inscription played in the compositional process. The major points of the chapter are that the composition of screen poetry effected a separation of poet and speaker, helped establish the conventions of poetic topics, and may 376</page><page sequence="147">Abstracts have had a significant impact on the way that monogatari narratives were read and composed. Skilled screen poets capitalized on the limitations of occasional verse by using an "optical allusion" to expand the meaning of his or her poems to include a complex network of poetic associations and express sentiments ap- propriate to an occasion while simultaneously referring to a specific painted im- age. Such screen poems enhanced the image on which they were based by ad- ding sensory elements that could not be painted, such as temperature, motion, and sound, and yet could still be appreciated independently, without reference to the pictures upon which they were based. In Chapter Three, I show how the visual arts played a pivotal role in the early formation of assigned topics (dai) in Heian Japan and helped poets mediate di- rect experience and poetic expression. I argue that the way that poetic topics developed in the period leading up to Kokinshi is inextricable from the rise of screen painting and other visual arts during the same period. Chapter Four centers on the famous poet-priest Saigy (1118-1190) and his sequence of twenty-seven poems he composed "Upon Seeing Pictures of Hell". My major point in analyzing these poems is to show how Saigy crosses the lines of convention and genre--by using terms not usually found in traditional waka poetry, and by making extensive use of dramatic prose reminiscent of monogatari narrative. In exploring the visual-verbal nexus to an unprecedented degree, Saigy6 blurs the line between orthodox and unorthodox composition and ventures into uncharted realms of poetic expression.

This dissertation examines the theme of exile in Heian period (794-1185) re- ligion, literature, and law. While exile was only one of five categories of punish- ment mentioned in the early Japanese law codes, no other sanction came to oc- cupy so great a place in the Heian Japanese imagination. Myths, literature, and religious cults from Nara and Heian abound with stories of the exile of gods, tales of exile from the moon, and the worship of spirits of exiled nobility. To address this widespread trope I adopt a cultural studies approach, examining the Ritsuryo legal codes, works of literature such as Taketori monogatari and Genji 377</page><page sequence="148">Japanese Language and Literature monogatari, and oracle texts and historical chronicles associated with the trans- formation of the exiled courtier Sugawara Michizane into the deity Tenjin. In each instance, I analyze how themes of exile and divinity provided particularly resonant means by which groups re-imagined the constellation of power within Heian society. I begin and conclude by examining the theories of the twentieth century scholar Orikuchi Shinobu, showing how the act of imagining exile, far from disappearing with the advent of modernity, continued to provide a means by which people re-imagined both Heian society and the contemporary social order.

Colonial and postcolonial discourse studies have focused almost entirely on Anglo and Francophone texts. This dissertation primarily deals with colonial and postcolonial discourses from Japan, which since the mid-nineteenth century has experienced both Western cultural and economic colonization and occupa- tion on the one hand and its own colonial (military, political, economic and cultural) expansion in areas of Asia and the Pacific area on the other hand. The dissertation concentrates on the representations of the Pacific, in which Asia/ Pacific, Japan and the West have been involved with one another, the three sub- jects conditioning Japanese colonialism and postcolonialism. A key segment of the dissertation is that the three-way interactions of colonial/postcolonial repre- sentations of Japanese in the Pacific region produce a colonial subject different from Eurocentric colonial models and more complex than dominant Self-Other theories have allowed. In considering colonialism and postcolonialism in the Pa- cific, the dissertation points out that the Japanese subject as colonizer/colonized is used in contemporary texts from Japan and the Pacific islands to intervene not only in the colonial myths of southern earthly paradise but also in the anti- colonial binarism of oppressor/oppressed.

This dissertation examines the theatrical work of the Korean Diaspora in Ja- pan after World War II. This group is referred to here as "Zainichi-Koreans", evoking their hybrid, nomadic status in Japan. Theatre by "Zainichi-Koreans" embodies the representational strategies which they have used since the end of the war. These representational strategies are shaped by the hegemonic Japa- nese, the "Zainichi-Koreans" diasporic imaginary, and cultural, national and eth- nic identification. Korean diasporic theatre, ideologies of the Japanese nation- state, and tradition are three topics addressed in this dissertation. I utilize theo- ries that apply to modemrn Japanese theatre, intercultural theatre, and neo- and/or post-coloniality, and employ both Japanese and Western formulations. These in- clude Julia Kristeva on the abject, Michael Omi and Howard Winant's definition of "race", Paul Gilroy "Against Race", Rustom Bharucha on the secular, Neil Lazarus and Harry D. Harootunian on modernity, Joseph R. Roach on surro- gation, Sakabe Toshiki on reflexivity, Tsurumi Shunsuke on tenko (recantation), and Kayama Rika on Japanese "petit-nationalism". Korean diasporic theatre must be considered within the context of contemporary Japanese theatre. Thus, I look at the work of Hirata Oriza and Kaneshita Tatsuo and how it defines a "Japanese standard" as a reflection of growing Japanese neo-nationalism. I show how neo-nationalism was incipient in most post-World War II Japanese theatre and how it began to expand in the 1960s. I look at the work of Kara Jiur from the 1960s and 1970s for manifestations of neo-nationalism, and "Zainichi- Koreans" erasure. I examine the representational strategies of contemporary "Zainichi-Korean" playwrights and directors such as Tsuka K6hei, Yi Miri, Chong Wishin and Kim Sujin. Their work has been a constant effort to interact with a culture that marginalizes them, finding ways to gain a measure of agency as "Zainichi-Koreans". Most recently, the theatre troupe Shinjuku Ryazanpaku, founded by Chong and Kim, uses a mobile tent theatre to embody the nomadic, abject status of "Zainichi-Koreans". That tent also embodies the shift in the Ko- 379</page><page sequence="150">Japanese Language and Literature rean diasporic imaginary from a longing for a unified Korean homeland to one of a nomadic condition. The conclusion considers how Korean diasporic theatre may be taking the imaginary of a nomadic condition beyond the borders of Ja- pan, thereby creating potentially greater resistance to the hegemonic Japanese ideology of a homogeneous nation-state/ [Abstract on pages xi-xii of Swain's dissertation].

This dissertation aims at theorizing gendered subjectivity with regard to the meaning and representation of "woman" in the intertextual space of the Shake- spearean and kabuki theaters. Together with Jacques Lacan's writing on subjec- tivity, Jacques Derrida's work provides the methodological framework to prac- tice a deconstructive reading of the textual system that we inhabit. I decipher the fictional inscriptions of "woman" and their contradictory impli- cations in Shakespeare and kabuki. The ambiguous positions of women as the marginal other bring to light both the inner contradictions in the totalizing narra- tive of patriarchy on "woman" and the disruptive power of "woman" as radical other than "man", and suspend the logic of identity based on the dialectics of bi- nary oppositions. Meanwhile, womanliness masqueraded by male actors (boy actors and kabuki female impersonators) throws into relief the question of femininity and, further- more, the citationality and fictionality of"female" identity. We become a "man" or a "woman" by learning culturally defined gender-roles or, more precisely, the meaning of masculinity or femininity inscribed in and by language when we enter what Lacan calls the "symbolic order". In other words, the subject im- personates either "man" or "woman" for the gaze of the Other on the stage of this world theatre. If the condition of all human beings is im-personation, then contexts matter in this world theatre. At the same time, the subject can never be complete or fully real-ize itself since the effect of gendered subjectivity is induced and re-presented as "fiction" 380</page><page sequence="151">Abstracts (or ideological anamorphosis) and dispersed in and by the very undecidable play of meaning-as an incomplete (hi)story of the "I" narrated in the tense of the future anterior. Nevertheless, this very impossibility of the subject's identity- with-itself perhaps opens up the possibility of the subject as the process of be- coming.

While scholars have often concep- 381</page><page sequence="152">Japanese Language and Literature tualized Japan's empire in terms of the proximity of colonizer to colonized, I look at the representations of two groups which the Japanese considered most distant from themselves: Taiwanese aborigines and South Sea islanders. Specifi- cally, I explore the trope of "savagery" in texts written between 1907 and 1942 by Oshika Taku (1898-1959), Sato Haruo (1892-1964), Akutagawa Rytinosuke (1892-1927), Nitobe Inaz6 (1862-1923), Hijikata Hisakatsu (1900-1977) and Nakajima Atsushi (1909-1942). The trope of the "savage" undergoes a number of metamorphoses during this time frame: violent headhunter to be subjugated, ethnographic "other" to be studied, happy primitives to be exoticized, and hy- brid colonial subject to be assimilated. I organize these texts into chapters that trace the different stages of Japan's imperial trajectory: early colonial conquest, liberalist critiques of colonialism, late colonial integration and wartime mobil- ization. "Savagery" is a polyvalent trope that these writers use not only to talk about cultural "otherness", but also to write allegories about their own ambiva- lence towards Japan's modernity and their experience as Japanese colonizers. My approach to these texts is interdisciplinary and comparative. I am espe- cially interested in the connections between the literary text and a broader nexus of social discourses: the writings of colonial administrators, ethnographic re- ports, Western colonial narratives, popular manga, school textbooks and eugenic science. By situating the literary texts in this wider context of discourse, I call into question the boundaries traditionally used to demarcate literature, popular culture, social science and history. Besides introducing neglected works from this critical historical period, I believe that my dissertation sheds new light on the nature of the Japanese imperial gaze and the ambivalence that often charac- terized the lived experience of Japanese colonialism. In Chapter One, I focus on images of Taiwanese aborigines as "headhunters" in conquest narratives by Oshika Taku and others against the background of the violent subjugation of the Taiwan highlands and the official discourse on Ja- pan's civilizing mission. In Chapter Two, I turn to the relationship between a story by Sato Haruo and the construction of subjugated "primitives" as an object of science in colonial ethnography. In Chapter Three, I study the bifurcation of colonial images of the South Seas in the 1920s and 1930s between romanticized images of happy primitives in island paradises in works by Akutagawa Rytino- suke and Hijikata Hisakatsu and concurrent popular stereotypes of South Sea islanders as racialized and violent others in mass media. In Chapter Four, I con- centrate on stories about the South Seas by the late colonial writer Nakajima Atsushi to explore new concerns with cultural hybridity and racial mixing that characterized the period of the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Sumie Jones. xii, 316, 2p. DAI 65, no.12 (June 2005): 4570-A; UM 3156325. When Japan's missions of political and cultural leaders were sent to visit Western countries by the Tokugawa shogunate and by the newly formed Meiji government during the 1860s and 1870s, what impressed the members was the important position that theater held in each nation. Inspired by this discovery, the progressive theater manager Morita Kan'ya XII, the powerful politician Ito Hirobumi, and the ambitious journalist Fukuchi Ochi collaborated, between 1878 and 1879, to create a "Japanese national drama" that was comparable to nineteenth-century Western theater. As a result, kabuki, which had flourished as a popular entertainment for Tokugawa com- moners, was suddenly burdened by the need to deserve the elevated position of representing Japanese culture. The commercial theater for entertainment was in- vited to turn into a public theater, and as such, forced to encounter Western civ- ilization face to face. This ambitious attempt has tended to be treated as an individual undertaking and as a mere part of the trend of "kabuki reform" in Japan's theater history. I believe, however, that this undertaking is better viewed as an attempt not merely to reform or modify but also to "transform" kabuki into a totally different kind of theater for a totally different kind of audience, specifically, into national drama aimed at upper class citizens and intellectual elites including foreigners. This dissertation reevaluates Morita Kan'ya's kabuki productions of 1878-79 as representing a unique hybrid resulting from the direct, if accidental and frag- mental, encounter between nineteenth-century Western theater and Meiji kabuki. Furthermore, this research reveals that the significance of these productions is best understood within the large cultural and political scope of the "reformation" of kabuki and the "transformation" of Japanese theater, a scope that Kan'ya, and his collaborators and his advisors, claimed from the start.

Chairperson/Major Adviser: Edward Kamens. xi, 543, 342p. DAI 66, no.11 (May 2006): 4028-A; UM 3194724. The standard view of Eiga monogatari (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes) under- stands the "flowering fortunes" of the title as belonging to Fujiwara no Michi- naga (966-1027), who presided over the literary flourishing of the eleventh- century Heian court of Emperor Ichijo. Eiga monogatari, however, is much more than an aggrandized story about his glory. My aim in this study is to ex- hume stories of women buried in Eiga monogatari, forgotten in the conventional narratives regarding Heian period culture, while demonstrating the significance of Eiga monogatari as one of the earliest forms of response to Genji monogatari in using the language of "tales" to compose "history". In chapter One, I introduce one such woman: the putative author of Eiga monogatari, Akazome Emon, unjustly neglected so far despite her fame as a poet among her contemporaries. Chapter Two discusses previous scholarship on Eiga monogatari by examining the construction of grandiose narratives about the Heian period that have adversely affected our view of its literary culture. In Chapter Three, I contemplate the representation of buried mothers. I argue that their burials in a tamaya (spirit hut), as they are represented in the work, grant them solidarity as pitiful but proud women who refused to participate in Michi- naga's glory. In Chapter Four, I demonstrate how the author threads characters together through suggestive, overlapping details to form what I call figural con- stellations. These groupings illustrate the range of experiences in court life dur- ing the eleventh century. In Chapter Five, I discuss the fathers and daughters who appear as mono no ke (malevolent spirit possessions). I contend that one of the motivations heading the representation of "buried women" was the fear of such possessions. In the sixth chapter, I examine The Sequel (zokuhen), the last ten chapters of Eiga monogatari, proposing that The Sequel is an apt embodi- ment of the hybrid, pluralistic nature of the work as a whole, combining many authors, texts, and figures into a single work. As an appendix, I offer a complete translation of The Sequel (Books 31-40). [Abstract on pages iii-iv of Wata- nabe's dissertation]. Contents: Introduction. 1.

This dissertation considers how poems collected in Kaifiis&amp; (751) and the three ninth-century royal anthologies functioned in the context of the increas- ingly centralized Yamato government of ancient Japan. These "Chinese-lan- guage poems" are known collectively as kanshi. My study addresses the follow- ing questions: In what ways did they serve to confirm, or (less often) challenge, political authority? What theories existed regarding the proper relationship be- tween writing and governing? How were these ideals put into practice? How did the government monitor poetic activity? What significance should we assign to narratives in which discursive deviance was punished? While maintaining an emphasis on poetic rhetoric, I also seek to understand these poems as ritual ges- tures, possessing special functions unique to their court contexts. To that end, I consider kanshi together with a wide range of other writings: uta, setsuwa, monogatari, edicts, juridical records, obituaries, diplomatic correspondence, and prefaces to poetic anthologies. Because kanshi are written in an idiom of classical Chinese, and because they are rife with references to continental texts, it is nearly impossible to discuss them without confronting the additional problem of reception; that is, the ways in which Nara and Heian poets interpreted, quoted, and put to use textual mater- ials that flowed in from the continent. My approach has sought to go beyond familiar nation-state-based articulations of reception such as Nihon-ka (Japan- ization) and wa-kan (Japaneseness-Chineseness) by construing reception as an historically contingent plurality of textual interpretations. Focusing on the plu- rality of reception, I argue, renews appreciation for the dizzying variety of im- ported texts available at court, the range of interpretations that any single text or writer potentially could evoke, and the fact that poets appropriating from the same texts at nearly the same time were motivated by their own immediate (and often disparate) purposes-not out of some inexorable status of just being Japa- nese.

This thesis is an appraisal of the novel Ikitsugite (For Generations) by the writer Ichinose Aya (born in 1932), who enjoys a reputation for being an ob- server of young rural people's lives. Many of her works, including Ikitsugite, deal with individuals who face hardship for reasons that are not their fault. The thesis presents for the first time three chapters of the novel in English translation (chapters 6, 9 and 13) as the basis for the discussion and analysis of the text as an accurate portrayal in fiction of the real-life experience of the hard- ships faced by war widows and their offspring for generations. I argue that Ichi- nose's portrayal levels criticism against the Japanese government as the architect of the policies which brought about the suffering of war widows and the con- tinuing discrimination against them and their offspring.

This dissertation focuses on the Hiroshima memorial practices within which the survivors of the atomic bomb appear as innocent victims. Recent historical studies, however, point to Japanese responsibility for the Asia-Pacific War (1931-1945) and challenge the innocent image of the Hiroshima survivors. The Hiroshima community faced a methodological impasse in dealing with its prob- lems: the survivors' ambivalence between victim and victimiser and a tension between history and memory. This dissertation proposes a new perspective on these problems by adopting and adapting Hannah Arendt's "storytelling" as its methodology. Chapter One explores the complex structure of the commemoration of the dropping of the atomic bomb. It presents the results of my interviews with sur- vivors and the younger generation, and outlines several factors that influence the survivors' testimonies and memories. I point out that Hiroshima memorial prac- tices have developed characteristic views on the following issues: (a) the surviv- 386</page><page sequence="157">Abstracts ors' identity, (b) the symbolism of the "spirit of Hiroshima", and (c) the mean- ings of the event in Hiroshima. Chapter Two describes scholars' views from the 1990s of the dropping of the atomic bomb and the commemoration of this event. It focuses especially on opinions concerning Japanese responsibility and Hiroshima memories as argued by Takahashi Tetsuya and Kato Norihiro. Takahashi and Kato find victim con- sciousness and ethnocentric tendencies in the officially sanctioned Hiroshima memories. Their views of the atomic bomb reflect the nationalist claim of the re- visionist historians. I argue that their debate considers the following issues: (a) Japan's responsibility for its colonialism in the Asia and Pacific region, and (b) national identity. Regarding the latter, Takahashi and Kato examine Hannah Arendt's historical approach, storytelling. The social constructionism presented by Ueno Chizuko, the sociologist of feminism, coincides with Arendt's story- telling. Chapter Three develops Kato and Takahashi's analysis of Hannah Arendt's conception of "storytelling". Arendt's storytelling suggests a way to place per- sonal memories into the broader context of the history. I investigate two issues: Arendt's identity and her characterization of storytellers, by explaining her life and her philosophical conceptions of "natality", Selbstdenken and "judgment". I point out that the core of Arendt's storytelling is her notion of "in-between". The notion of "in-between" suggests dynamic possibilities for young generation to create new stories about the first nuclear disaster in Hiroshima, by focusing on the equivocal identity of the Hiroshima survivors. In conclusion, I argue that Hannah Arendt's storytelling is the most appropri- ate methodology for approaching the Hiroshima memories within the context of current historical perspectives of Japan's wartime responsibility. My analysis, however, questions two conceptions: sensus communis and the principle of the "in-between". I use Julia Kristeva's notion of the "abject" as the most useful way to develop Arendt's notion of "in-between" for application to Hiroshima memories and memorial practices.

This dissertation examines action-based art and theatrical performances that 387</page><page sequence="158">Japanese Language and Literature utilize artistic strategies of abstraction and the assertion of actuality in order to circumvent portrayal. Proposing a Weberian ideal concept of Dis-play, which opposes the conventional Play form that haunts most studies of theatrical per- formance, I argue throughout that it is possible to sidestep mimetic represen- tation and effect a socially valuable non-Aristotelian catharsis of perceptual dis- ruption. In the opening chapters, I examine the threats posed to critical thinking by the legacy of theatrical naturalism and by the increase in technologies of simulation, arguing that action-based art such as performance must arrest and confront spec- tators with phenomenological actuality rather than distract them via aesthetic fantasy. These chapters critique the aesthetic theories of mimesis as put forth by Aristotle and Plato by examining the teleology of catharsis as it relates to the modes of both representational drama and non-representational poetry. I follow this theoretical framework with an overview of twentieth-century attempts to overthrow the stranglehold of mimetically representational performance, focus- ing on the critical reception of American Modem Dance and various European artists such as the Symbolists, Pirandello, Brecht, and the Absurdists. In the remaining chapters, I analyze in detail how specific artists have em- ployed strategies of abstract treatment and the assertion of actuality as well as the perceptually disruptive consequences which their artworks effect in spec- tators. I first explore the work of the Gutai artists working in Japan in the 1950s, positing that their works disrupt spectators' notions of time by creating traces of action reduced to forms. My next exploration considers four productions of the Living Theatre, whose pursuit of a sincere form of acting began with poetic texts, moved on to realistic portrayals and ended with a complete rejection of mimetic representation. The next chapter analyzes the impact of Elizabeth Streb's Pop Action choreographic structures on spectators' sensations of time, identity and authority. My final chapter, an examination of the insufficient poetic texts of Leslie Scalapino, considers whether it is possible to transform writing into action through non-representational performance.
