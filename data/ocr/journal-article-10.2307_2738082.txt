FINK Du kommst mir vor wie Saul, der Sohn Kis, der ausging, seines Vaters Eselinnen zu suchen und ein K6nigreich fand. Hieran halte man sich. Denn im Grunde scheint doch das Ganze nichts anderes sagen zu wollen, als dass der Mensch, trotz aller Dummheiten und Verwirrungen, von einer hoheren Hand geleitet, doch zum gliicklichen Ziele gelange.' IT IS PARADOXICAL that human life is subject to chance and acci- dent, while at the same time showing signs of law and order. The maturation of an individual, wrote Goethe, is fraught with false starts, obscure directions, hidden forces, and sudden failure. Yet alongside these unpredictable events there is evidence of patterns that make life seem preordained and events stereotyped. This interplay of design and chance in human life is a central message in Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (1795-96), a novel whose origins and sequel preoccupied Goethe most of his life.2 Indeed, the novel illustrates Goethe's belief that human life, when observed under any imaginable conditions, would sometimes show p?roportional and mathematical harmony and other times divisive and confused agitation: "Gesetz und Zufall greifen in einander . . . und hier liegt das Inkalkulable, das Inkommensurable der Weltge- 9 '3 1 Johann P.

These two concepts, functioning together in an individual's development, represent an un- derlying principle of Goethe's science of man.4 Although they origi- nated from differing traditions, purpose from Neoplatonism and chance from atomism, Goethe viewed their function as contrapuntal. That is, the occurrence of events in an individual's life, at any point in time, might be the product of accident as well as prediction.5 Goethe realized these concepts as counterpoint in his study of Wilhelm Meister's devel- opment. The study lasted about fifty years (1778-1825) and the opening passage, above, came at the end of that period, after much reflection on the relationship of law and chance in the life of an individual. The coexistence of two concepts such as purpose and chance is found in most of Goethe's later writings, be it in his dramatic treatment of Wilhelm Meister or in his historical treatment of Johannes Kepler. What was in the air at the turn of the century that brought Goethe to this paradox and to its significance for the human condition? Scholarship on Goethe and Platonism has never fully responded to the question,6 for it has dealt only with the second half of the opening passage,7 declaring that events are "von einer hoheren Hand geleitet." It is clear from Goethe's writings at the turn of the century that other systems of thought were afoot, challenging the stereotypes of determinism that had been 4 See Karl J.

Marchand (Carbondale: Southern Illinois Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 41-55. 5 Goethe, too, was an individual influenced by any number of events at any point in time and we would have to assume for any study of the older Goethe that the influence of various traditions increased proportionately with his age. For a discussion on random processes see Maurice S. Bartlett, An Introduction to Stochastic Processes (New York and London: Cambridge Univ.

B. Nisbet, Goethe and the Scientific Tradition (London: The Institute of Germanic Studies, 1972). 7 There is little reason to expect that before 1960 scholarship would note the impor- tance of atomism for Goethe's poetic writings, for it was only then that serious research began on Goethe as a historian of science.

Goethe's response to the tradition of atomism came rather late com- pared to the response by French and English writers such as Voltaire (1694-1778), Andre Chenier (1762-94), James Thomson (1700-48), and Thomas Gray (1716-71).1o However, it came at a time of general appreciation in Germany for the Greek and Roman forerunners of the tradition. By the middle of the eighteenth century leading German intellects such as Lessing had expressed respect for Lucretian thought and had assimilated various concepts into their own philosophy. Yet it was not until the final decade of the century that the Weimar circle, which included Duke Karl August, Karl von Knebel, Herder, and Goethe, took serious interest in the entire tradition. 11 At that time Herder took particular interest in the espousal of the ideals of rural life in Books 8 Special credit goes to Professor H.

F. Meinecke, published the first German translation of De rerum natura. The movement, beginning with Meinecke's translation in 1795 and concluding with a much improved translation by Knebel in 1821,13 had a profound impact on German thought at the turn of the century. In Goethe's case the tradition left a mark on his scientific writings and on the language, imagery, structure, and thought of several of his major literary works. It was through his research into the history of optics during the last decade of the eighteenth century that Goethe became acutely aware of the various philosophies of the organization of matter, particularly those of the atomists. He studied the ancient documents on Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius, tracing the expansion of atomism into modern times in the writings of Pierre Gassendi, Robert Boyle, Nicolas Male- branche, and Claude L. Berthollet. 4 From these writings Goethe discovered concepts such as vacuous space, infinite matter, multishaped atoms, action over a distance, and matter and motion, making note throughout of their significance for the human condition. A concept important to Goethe's reception of Lucretian atomism was the notion that matter contained a "swerve" [Beugen der Stoffe], and that this characteristic of a particle existed "schon in den Keimen des Stoffs. "15 Among the implications Goethe drew from this was the idea of free will and a denial of a world order preordained and constantly influenced by a Divine Being. Nature was no longer to be viewed as the Platonic conformation of a blueprint, but was to be seen as open to chance interaction. Thus Goethe perceived that Lucretius' theory of matter had a built-in potential for entities to deviate from an absolute path. In his research notes Goethe also observed that the chaotic times of Lucretius did not make such a view attractive, for free will, choice, chance, and unknown potentialities did not relieve the anxieties of a 12 See Wolfgang Schmid, "Lukrez und der Wandel seines Bildes," Antike und Abendland, 2 (1946), 198, and Carl Hammer, Goethe and Rousseau: Resonances of the Mind (Lexington: Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1973), pp. 122-36. 13 According to Hadzsits, Lucretius and his Influence, p. 328, the Meinecke transla- tion first appeared in 1795.

For Goethe and his times the "swerve" in Lucretian atomism was a relief from religious deter- minism, but it also created for him and his age the burden of confronting a cosmology void of Providence. Goethe began to study the transition from ancient to modern atomism in the fall of 1800 and was to remain fascinated by the drift of basic ideas through the centuries: "Wie wunderbar verhalt sich nicht Gassendi zu Epikur. "16 Goethe noted that after Pierre Gassendi the tradition of atomism took on a new significance, as in the mechanical explanations of scientists like Robert Boyle. He devoted seven pages in his history of optics to Boyle, noting that Boyle, like other seventeenth-century writ- ers, considered light to be a substance, subject to "Corpusculare Globu- lare, rotirende mechanische ahnliche Erklirungen. "17 In researching Boyle's experiments with the air pump, Goethe observed the signifi- cance of vacuous space for atomism, but he also recognized the conflict- ing views in Boyle's writings as symptomatic of seventeenth-century science. Cartesian plenists, for example, had asserted that completely empty space is folly. However, in order to completely fill space mem- bers of this school of thought, such as Nicolas Malebranche, postulated vortices of particles with varying degrees of coarseness and subtlety. This was, of course, necessitated by the view that there was only action by contact in space, not action over a distance, as asserted by Newton. By 1700 many of these tensions were worked out at the empirical, theoretical, and even at the theological level. Indeed, the groundwork for integrating Christianity and atomism had been laid by the Cambridge Platonists who allowed for discrete particles and design, relieving the tensions by purifying atomism from overtones of atheism. 18 Thus, while Newton himself generally avoided clear statements on the role of Provi- 16 Goethe (LA), Pt.

Rattansi, "Newton and the 'Pipes of Pan,"' Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, 21 (1966), 108-43, for a study of Newton's integration of design arguments and atomism. Indeed, Danton B. Sailor, "Moses and Atomism, "Journal of the History of Ideas 25 (1964), 3-16, argues that Newton, like the Cambridge Platonists, attempted to unite Christian tradition and atomism and that Moses' creation story provided them such a link.

Goethe on the other hand was less affected by the theological difficulties presented by classical atomism and, rather than purify it, made contrapuntal key concepts such as chance and accident. Atomism in Germany, particularly as conceived by Goethe, never went through the stages of purification it had been subjected to, for example, by Henry More in England and by Pierre Gassendi in France. Goethe's study of pagan atomism was part of a larger movement in Germany, headed by August Wolf, in the revolution of historiography. 19 The approach of these late eighteenth century Ger- mans to the history of science was philological, and it was close analysis and translation of documents that led Goethe to key observations such as the importance of a "swerve, " a "Beugen der Stoffe" for the metaphys- ical and theological levels of atomism. Since Goethe became familiar with atomism rather late in the eighteenth century, he was no longer dealing only with a response to the thoughts of Lucretius, but to a blossoming tradition which had been greatly expanded by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century writers. By 1800 Goethe was responding to a tradition which had proliferated into most fields of inquiry, including developing fields such as psychol- ogy.20 By then the language of atomism had precipitated various sys- tems of thought with overlapping and closely related concepts, so that as the century progressed it became increasingly difficult to distinguish between Cartesian corpuscles, Newtonian bodies, and Leibnizian monads. It was early in the century that the thought systems of Descartes and Newton were being challenged by a third alternative, the monadol- ogy of Leibniz.2" The questions concerning the nature of particles, the possibility of vacuous space, as well as concepts such as matter, motion, 19 Herbert Butterfield, Man on his Past: The Study of the History of Historical Scholarship (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1955), p. 42, compares the seventeenth-century revolution in science to the eighteenth-century revolution in his- toriography, emphasizing as the respective intellectual centers of these movements Padua and Gottingen.

His simple substances, like Newton's bodies, were discrete entities and like Descartes's corpuscles they formed a continuity in nature. Leibniz attempted to further synthesize the tradi- tion by attributing unique and uniform characteristics to his monads. These ultimate particles then had characteristics in common with other particles, but at the same time were capable of changing their nature from within their own structure. Leibniz's monadology was of particular importance to Goethe's total conception of atomism both for the dual emphasis on the similar and unique features of an individual entity and for his emphasis on an active principle, "Prinzip der Veranderung," inherent in each individual. Leibniz's monadology was an anthropomorphic atomism and served Goethe well for his own vitalistic approach to the description of natural and human events. The monadology, particularly as interpreted by romantics such as Friedrich W. J. Schelling, provided a point of view which focused on the life of an individual in process. Thus Goethean concepts such as "Tatigkeit," "gepragte Form," "Polaritat," "Stre- ben, " and "Metamorphose" became fundamental to his description of the maturation of individuals such as Wilhelm Meister.22 Indeed the chance interactions in Wilhelm's development are an expression of Leibniz's doctrine of individual accidents, where it is the accidents, as opposed to the attributes, that give individuality to an entity. That is, the predictable characteristics do not mark the individuality of a phenome- non as do those characteristics which are random and peculiar.23 Although Goethe was acquainted with various thought systems within atomism, he did not totally accept any of them; this is obvious especially in his long campaign against Newtonian optics.24 However, he was 22 Hermann Schmitz, Goethes Altersdenken im problemgeschichtlichen Zusam- menhang (Bonn: Bouvier, 1959), pp. 285-91, provides a survey of scholarship on Goethe's acquaintance with Leibniz's monadology, stressing the role played by Roman- tic philosophers in Goethe's interpretation of Leibniz's writings.

It was precisely the paradoxical perspective and the confusion in terminology that became the most significant factors in his poetization of the atomistic tradition. While the tradition provided him with a rich supply of symbols and imagery for depicting the human condition, it also gave him the opportunity to comment on the state of eighteenth-century science. Goethe's ability to enrich the German language with concepts, im- ages, symbols, and metaphors from various traditions is one of his unique contributions to German poetry.25 From the language of atomism he selected actio in distans as a key metaphor in a number of his works after 1800. Although this particular concept was basic to Newton's system of thought, Goethe was able to use the metaphor in his poetical writings without accepting Newtonian science. Goethe used such con- cepts to describe the human condition, but at the same time he showed the inadequacy of the language of science for the description of social events. Goethe's position in eighteenth-century science is indeed paradoxical. While he disagreed with Newton's mechanical and materi- alistic language for the explanation of light and color, he contributed greatly to the history of science by introducing British science to Ger- man language and thought.26 That Goethe should select actio in distans as a central metaphor is not surprising, for most important thinkers of the eighteenth century were captivated by the concept and used it in various fields of inquiry. John Locke, Immanuel Kant, William Porterfield, Torbern Bergman, Daniel Jenisch, and many others organized entire systems of knowledge around this concept whose mystical overtones were suspect prior to 1686.27 At that time Isaac Newton formalized the concept with a mathematical 25 On Goethe's contribution to the development of a German literary language see Eric A.

Fink in "Eighteenth-century actio in distans: The Origins of a Fiction, " paper presented at the Midwest ASECS meeting in Bloomington, Indiana, October 1975.</page><page sequence="9">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 385 description of the relationship and motion of distant celestial bodies: "the whole force with which one of these spheres attracts the other will be reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance of the centres. "28 Newtonian science had made the concept of actio in distans fashionable for the explanation of other phenomena in terms of attrac- tion and repulsion. Query Thirty-one of Newton's Opticks (1717) illus- trates the potential of the concept for the poetization of human and natural events: Have not the small Particles of Bodies certain Powers, Virtues, or Forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the Rays of Light for reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them, but also upon one another for producing a great Part of the Phenomena of Nature? For it's well known, that Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and these Instances shew the Tenor and Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive Powers than these.29 The concept of actio in distans had become basic to scientific thought in the eighteenth century, as can be observed in Immanuel Kant's theory of the origin and structure of the universe.30 At midcentury, Kant had used attraction and repulsion to describe the development of galactic systems from minute particles scattered throughout the universe, parti- cles that began to form chunks and then collections of chunks rotating around a common center. Through atomism Kant described the genesis and stability of a collection of well-ordered systems of stars in a manner that does not differ greatly from today's view of the cosmos. A cosmology based on sound principles of mathematics and on an integrated system of astronomy appealed to eighteenth-century thinkers. Goethe is not to be excluded from those who found in atomism a security which other systems of thought did not give: Seit unser vortrefflicher Kant mit diirren Worten sagt: es lasse sich keine Materie ohne Anziehen und Abstossen denken, (das heisst doch wohl, nicht ohne Polaritat,) bin ich sehr beruhigt, unter dieser Autoritat meine Welt- anschauung fortsetzen zu konnen, nach meinen friihesten Uberzeugungen, an denen ich niemals irre geworden bin.3t 28 Isaac Newton, The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1729), trans.

IV, Vol. 24, p. 227.</page><page sequence="10">386 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES Goethe felt secure in the atomistic and scientifically explained world, and like other atomists he was also content to have God be the one to set the universe into motion with an initial act, allowing the various parts and particles of the universe to seek out their independent pattern of life. While Newton was to suggest divine intervention for occasional repair of the stellar clockwork, and while Kant anticipated no deviations in the law of gravity and the present constitution of the universe, Goethe turned his attention to the implications of atomism for the life of a human being. These implications centered around the concept of actio in distans, which was also the original title of a ballad conceived around 1810 and later published as "Wirkung in die Ferne. " The same concept had appeared earlier in chemistry as attractionibus electivis, and was to be chosen by Goethe as the title of his novel: Die Wahlverwandtschaf- ten. Five years after the novel's publication, Goethe again made exten- sive use of the metaphor in the West-6stlicher Divan, particularly in the poem "Wiederfinden.'" In these literary works Goethe illustrated the force of attractive powers in human interaction. He also illustrated the use of scientific concepts as a tool for describing the path of individual lives and as a forum for criticizing science. Finally, within these works Goethe brought concepts from several traditions and thought systems into counterpoint, making the perplexities of language and thought the central message in his description of the life of an individual. The appeal of free will, innate forces, and chance was strong in the eighteenth century and contributed to the rise and continued penetration of atomism in the thought and language of writers. In Roman times Lucretius had attempted to overcome the belief that determined and preordained patterns were characteristic of natural and human events. In his system of thought he had introduced the notion that each particle has an inherent slight swerve, slant, or obliqueness, allowing a deviation from the mrromentary path. Individual entities were given a degree of choice in their destiny and the future was not mapped out for them in advance. Goethe did not accept the gentle swerve as a datum of the human condition, but positioned it in counterpoint to the view that the path of life is preestablished. In Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre we find the confusion and perplexities of conflicting systems of thought to be the central issue, as Wilhelm reflects on the riddles and strange incidents in the development of his life: "Sonderbar! . . . sollten zufallige Ereig-</page><page sequence="11">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 387 nisse einen Zusammenhang haben? Und das, was wir Schicksal nennen, sollte es bloss Zufall sein?9932 Wilhelm is perplexed by his unpredictable and occasional encounters with individuals important to his life, such as the child Felix: "Wo kommst du her mein Kind, gerade in diesem Augenblick?"33 Yet Wilhelm also sees that these chance events form a pattern which seems in part to be structured by a higher power, namely, the "tower society" that watches over his development. Although he discovers the existence of this society, it does not inform him of his particular pattern of life and he is left to wander and reflect upon his course.34 At the end of the novel he is as confused as ever concerning his future. He knows that he will continue to err in his search for a pattern of life which is commensurate with his innate characteristics and true potentials. However, only in retrospect will he be assured of the role which chance and design have played in developing these potential characteristics. Although the development of individual lives in Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre certainly reflects the thought systems of atomism, particu- larly the monadology of Leibniz, the symbolism of language is not as specific as that found in his later novel, Die Wahlverwandtschaften. In 1796, at the time of Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre 's publication and more than a decade before publication of Die Wahlverwandtschaften, Goethe became concerned with the implications of substituting terminology for inorganic matter for properties of living matter. Various sections of the essay "Einleitung in die Vergleichende Anatomie, "3 show Goethe toying with notions of determinism, free will, external influences, innate forces, and mortality at a time when the arbitrary distinction between organic and inorganic matter stood firm.36 In this essay Goethe 32 Goethe, Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (WA), ed. C. Schuddekopf, Pt. I, Vol. 23, p. 122. 33 Ibid., p. 127. 34 The view of the individual as a wanderer on a long journey is typical of Goethe's poetization of atomism and falls into the thought system of Leibniz as well. See Nieraad, Dav Bild vom lebendigen Spiegel, pp. 118-28, on the "Wandermotiv" in the writings of Leibniz and Goethe. 35 For Goethe's early conception of the novel see his "Tag- und Jahreshefte als Erganzung meiner sonstigen Bekenntnisse, von 1807-1822," ed.

Unfortunately, attempts to reconstruct the origins of the novel such as Hans Wolff, Goethe in der Periode der Wahlverwandtschaften (Bern: Francke, 1952), are based on biographical experiences like personal contacts and love affairs, but not on Goethe's intense intellectual experiences in the history of science. 36 The synthetic fabrication of organic substances (for example, urine by Friedrich Wohler) did not develop until about the time of Goethe's death.

(London: Macmillan, 1964), IV, 259.</page><page sequence="12">388 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES notes that indifference, "Gleichgiiltigkeit," seems more characteristic of the construction of inorganic matter than of living matter. However, he also notes that the bonding of minerals is in some instances con- ditioned by external circumstances rather than by their law or accident. He is repeating Berthollet's suggestion that factors other than affinity, such as mass and volatility, might be responsible for certain natural patterns.37 Thus Goethe left open the question of chance versus deter- minism in the interaction of organic as well as inorganic substances. Ten years later this same question was to surface again in Die Wahlver- wandtschaften. In Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre the perplexities brought about by the coexistence of law and chance are examined at the end of the novel. In Die Wahlverwandtschaften the key characters take up the question at the outset. The later novel begins with Charlotte and her husband, Eduard, enjoying a serene marriage in a rural setting typical of the landed aristocracy. The key metaphor is introduced early with the Captain's unexpected visit. A second visitor, Ottilie, soon follows. Before Ot- tilie's arrival, the Captain, Eduard, and Charlotte discuss the theoretical basis for the interaction of inorganic elements, giving the reader an insight into the developing affinities. While the two male characters display great knowledge of the role of attraction, repulsion, and affinity in chemical sciences, Charlotte finds such language inadequate. Instead she argues against accident, choice, and freedom as well as against design, determinism, and law: Aber ich wiirde niemals eine Wahl, eher eine Naturnothwendigkeit erblicken, und diese kaum; denn es ist am Ende vielleicht gar nur die Sache der Gelegenheit. Gelegenheit macht Verhaltnisse, wie sie Diebe macht; und wenn von Ihren Naturk6rpern die Rede ist, so scheint mir die Wahl bloss in den Handen des Chemikers zu liegen, der diese Wesen zusammenbringt.38 Charlotte is questioning the degree of choice involved in the attraction 37 Wolf, A History of Science, I, 378-79. It is significant that studies on the title of the novel as metaphor, such as Beda Allemann, "Zur Funktion der chemischen Gleichnis- rede in Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften," in Untersuchungen zur Literatur als Ge- schichte, ed. Vincent J. Giinter et al. (Berlin: Schmidt, 1973), pp. 199-218, have failed to place Goethe in the context of his knowledge of the history of science. Allemann's study in particular fails to show that through Charlotte Goethe challenged determinism and chance as final descriptions of human interaction. 38 Goethe, Die Wahlverwandtschaften, ed. M. Walberg (WA), Pt. I, Vol. 20, p. 53. While most studies see in the "Gleichnisrede" a determinism, there are studies such as Paul Hankammer, Spiel der Machte (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1960), where "Gleichnisrede" implies that human destiny is subject to "etwas Unerwartetes.'" While Hankammer tends toward the atomistic language, he cloaks his discussion in terms of alchemy and magic.</page><page sequence="13">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 389 between particles or between human beings. However, she also ques- tions the degree of determinism involved, suggesting that conditions, or situations, affect the state of relationships in organic and inorganic substances. Indeed, Charlotte's comments move beyond traditional notions of atomism and Neoplatonism and appear to be in step with advancements in chemistry. The relationships of elements are not acci- dental or determined, but are a matter of "Gelegenheit, " depending on the conditions in which an individual or substance is placed. Thus she uses the language of atomism as well as Neoplatonism, but avoids commitment to either system of thought and expresses concern for the implications of such perspectives for philosophy and for the human spirit. Charlotte's observation that there is no security in the thought systems of atomism and Neoplatonism has implications for her own spiritual and physical condition. The four individuals, while they become bonded collectively, also show individual attractions, Eduard leaving Charlotte for Ottilie and Charlotte inclining toward the Captain. The attractions and affinities soon draw the marriage partners apart, thus placing the design of marriage in juxtaposition to the free interaction of the indi- viduals. Indeed Ottilie, the child of nature, unwittingly follows her blind passion for Eduard, only later rejecting him for the sake of the social order that society established through the institution of marriage. In the end she does not become a product of natural law and individual chance, but renounces her beloved Eduard and places the process of life in a realm beyond design and accident. In the novel love becomes Goethe's version of that substance which, according to Leibniz, consists of spirit and matter. Within the concept of love Goethe combines both the spiritual and physical attractions be- tween Eduard and Ottilie, illustrating the Leibnizian unity of body and spirit as the underlying principles of nature. However, he also places the power of love on the same plane as magnetism, electricity, and gravity, for its effects bring about the death of Eduard and Charlotte's child and lead to Eduard's flight to join a military expedition. Goethe has used Charlotte's observation that man is above primitive drives of nature and able to accept or reject natural inclinations to challenge materialist determinism, through the irony of actio in distans. While the dialogue between the Captain and Eduard in chapter four remains atomistic and scientific, Charlotte adds a humanistic note, voicing sympathy for "die arme Luftsaure" who must now wander through infinity alone. Charlotte's concern for "die arme Luftsaure"</page><page sequence="14">390 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES early in the novel seems to be a premonition of her own future, which includes periods of unattached wandering through uncharted areas of social and psychological existence. As she says, it is neither necessity nor choice that brought about her affinities, but the situation. One could hardly suggest that there was a physical or spiritual attraction at the outset of the novel, or any plans for it among the characters. Yet one cannot forego the comment that Charlotte alone seems to have the option of adding a slight swerve to her course of action, for her understanding of chemical and human relationships is the most sophisticated of the group. While Ottilie experiences more severely the decision to reject her natural impulses, Charlotte alone understands Lucretius' gentle swerve, making it possible to alter a course which seems headed for an unavoid- able collision, or for loneliness and oblivion. With her superior scientific and humanistic awareness, Charlotte also becomes the most afflicted individual in the novel, for she bears the burden of realizing the paradox between determinism and freedom in the interaction of individual entities. Indeed, the paradox is made more absurd when Eduard and Charlotte, each thinking of a second party during sexual intercourse, produce a child with the physical features of their respective thought-partners. Such a transference would indeed require a powerful force acting over a distance. What better presentation of life's quandary is there than this absurdity? The ludicrous event again marks Goethe's basic mistrust of any single system of thought which must ultimately conflict with other systems of equal prestige. It seems appropriate that his novel should introduce both sides of the issue, and add the third perspective of environmental conditioning, making the paradox the most significant factor of individual relationships. In addition to Goethe's longer prose works, there are several exam- ples of poetry in which we find the language and symbolism of the atomistic tradition. Most of this poetry appears in Goethe's later years, after publication of Die Wahlverwandtschaften. The ballad "Wirkung in die Ferne" was first printed in 1815, although the personal notations by Goethe and Friedrich W. Riemer lead us to assume that it had its basic conceptual structure by the early part of 1808. Critics generally seek the stimulus to the poem in some parapsychological experience that might have taken Dlace when the romantic Doet. Zacharias Werner. visited 39 The notes to most standard editions of Goethe 's writings such as Goethes Samtliche Werke, (Jubilaums-Ausgabe), ed. E. Heller, 40 vols. (Stuttgart: Cotta, 1902-12), will base the source of the poem on Goethe's meeting with Zacharias Werner in 1807. John Milfull, "The 'Idea' of Goethe's Wahlverwandtschaften," German Quarterly, 47 (1972), 83-94, goes so far as to base his discussion on Werner's theory of love.</page><page sequence="15">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 391 Weimar in 1807.39 While such experiences may have affected Goethe, his intensive search into atomism and the history of science at that time is a certainty. In his ballad the scientific concept actio in distans is used to illustrate the age-old conflict between the plenists and the atomists: those who, with Descartes, believed matter to be a con- tinuum, and those who, with Newton, accepted a universe of discrete parts. The Cartesians, who felt that all interaction between bodies must be caused by a pressure of one body upon another, condemned Newton's attraction over a distance as a revival of occultism. With tongue in cheek, Goethe again focused on the dilemma of conflicting thought systems by portraying the disagreements of the plenists and the atomists as a clandestine love affair. Like the elements in Kant's early stages of the cosmos, the queen's page and a beautiful lady in waiting rebound within the space of the castle walls. The former, sent on an errand by the queen, "eilt so behende, war bald an Schlosses Ende. "40 The lady in waiting, who spills some of her drink on her dress, also "eilt und fliegt so behende entgegen des Schlosses Ende." These two free particles collide at some remote spot but manage to disengage, the lady continuing to her room while the page returns to the queen in the banquet hall. The queen, being as wise as the Old Testament Queen of Sheba, takes advantage of an object lesson and renews an ancient argument with her mistress of ceremonies, saying: Wir kamen doch neulich zu Streite, Und ihr behauptetet steif und fest, Nicht reiche der Geist in die Weite; Die Gegenwart nur Die lasse wohl Spur; Doch niemand wirk' in die Ferne, Sogar nicht die himmlischen Sterne.4" The mistress of ceremonies has obviously taken the position of the Cartesian plenists who recognized no vacuity in space and hence no forces such as gravitation. She would claim the only forces in the universe to be those of impact of one particle on its neighbor: "Die Gegenwart nur, die lasse wohl Spur. " The young page, his vest soiled, appears to prove the contrary, serving as the wise queen's actio in distans. Of course, knowing that it was not really Newtonian action at a distance, but close contact which transferred the spot, the queen 40 Goethe, "Wirkung in die Ferne," in Gedichte, ed.

The language and imagery of atomism in "Wiederfinden" (1815) is not a common topos of scholarship. While the poem is rich in the language of many traditions, the atomistic tradition is well represented; the first stanza begins with the particle interaction of the two lovers who rejoice at their reunion after eons of dark separation. Union comes after the shattering hours of creation, which dispersed individual entities in some distant epoch in the past.43 As light and darkness separated in these early moments of creation, so also were all other elements scattered: "Jedes nach der Weite rang,/Starr, in ungemess'nen Raumen,/Ohne Sehnsucht, ohne Klang."44 In the fourth stanza Goethe described the chance reunion of particles through uncharted time and space in true atomistic fashion. These particles, bursting with the active principle of Leibniz's monads, "mit eiligem Bestreben," search through space for that which corresponds to themselves. If the particles should find their correspondences, their only concern would be to capture them: "wenn es nur sich fasst und halt!" Although there is strong imagery from the Christian tradition in the separation of light and darkness, there are important differences in the absence of preordination or Divine destiny when the particles combine. Only the initial dispersion is ordered, "Es Werde," upon which the universe groans with pain as "sogleich die Elemente scheidend aus- einander fliehn. " When the process of reunion begins, Allah no longer intervenes for "Allah braucht nicht mehr zu schaffen, wir erschaffen seine Welt." Indeed Goethe, like others in the atomistic tradition, seemed here to subscribe to a form of deism; God had set the universe into motion in an initial act, although he no longer interfered in its daily 42 Horst Haller's brief survey of commentaries on "Goethes Gedicht 'Wiederfin- den, "' Padagogische Rundschau, 15 (1961), 101-4, lists most of the standard opinions on the poem. For a longer discussion see the Studien zum West-bstlichen Divans Goethes, ed. E. Lohner (Darmstadt: Wiss.Buchgesellschaft, 1971), which includes examples of structural, biographical, and historical approaches. Most interpretations explain the poem in terms of Goethe's love experience, the Hebrew Creation myth, German mysticism, or in in terms of some pseudoscientific tradition such as alchemy. However, unnoticed in this recent revival of scholarship on the poem is a brief reference to the tradition of atomism made by Jonas Cohn, "Goethe's Gedicht 'Wiederfinden,"' Archiv fur Geschichte der Philosophie, 1 (1947), 122. 43 Goethe's notion of the evolution of the universe is like that of Kant, or as expressed in greater detail by more recent cosmologists such as Georges Lemaitre, The Primeval Atom: An Essay on Cosmogony, trans. Betty H. and Serge A. Korff (New York: Nostrand, 1950). 44 Goethe, "Wiederfinden, " in West-ostlicher Divan, ed. K. Burdach (WA), Pt. I, Vol. 6, pp. 188-89.</page><page sequence="17">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 393 functions. However, many deists subscribed to a mechanical philoso- phy, while Goethe returned to his own form of vitalism and chose Eros as his prime mover. He concluded the poem by returning to the two lovers, with whom he began, who now have cemented their bonds: So, mit morgenrothen Flugeln, Riss es mich an deinen Mund, Und die Nacht mit tausend Siegeln Kriftigt sternenhell den Bund.45 By 1820 the language of atomism had become part of Goethe's everyday language. In his later years actio in distans and associated terms were used to describe ordinary events, so that in a letter to Sulpiz Boisseree Goethe admitted that with regard to his old friend Johann Willemer and his more recent love relationship with Johann's third wife, Maria, "meine actio in distans weder sehr kraftig noch anhaltend ist. " And in a conversation with Kanzler von Muller, he commented that there were two types of women: "solche die actio in distans haben, und solche die nur durch Gegenwart etwas sind. "46 Indeed, by the time the metaphor was included in the poem "Wiederfinden, " such imagery had become so much a part of ordinary language that it escaped the attention of most interpretations of the poem. Goethe often used the language of atomism to express the most subtle of relationships. In his essays on the history of Oriental literature he discussed the gentle inclination of human hearts in the Song of Solomon: "Das Hauptthema jedoch bleibt gliihende Neigung jugendlicher Herzen, die sich suchen, finden, abstossen, anziehen, unter mancherlei h6chst einfachen Zustanden. " The terms "suchen," "finden," "abstossen, " and "anziehen" are, of course, central to the love theme in thei nneftrv of the Wo.ft-Xvdichor Divan hiut thpuy nre -nuiall1, rn.mmcn 45 Ibid., p. 189. Eros is a favorite topos of scholarship on the poem as in Walter Marg, "Goethes 'Wiederfinden, "' Euphorion, 46 (1952), 59-79, or in Wilhelm Schneider, Liebe zum deutschen Gedicht (Vienna: Herder, 1958), p. 235, although such scholarship fails to relate the force of love to atomism, especially to Leibniz's monadology. 46 Goethe's Briefe, ed.

The simple, yet forceful concepts of attraction and repulsion were favorites in Goethe's writing from 1800 to 1820. In Die Wahlver- wandtschaften he commented on the magnitude of the forces of attrac- tion and repulsion in human interaction; "Der Kopf ware nicht hin- reichend das zu fassen, es wiirde zerspringen oder sich verwirren. "48 And again in the West-ostlicher Divan Suleika expresses a similar awe of the force which attracts her to Hatem: Die Sonne kommt! Ein Prachterscheinen! Der Sichelmond umklammert sie. Wer konnte solch ein Paar vereinen? Diess Rathsel wie erklirt sich's? wie?49 As Suleika is puzzled by the source of the force which draws her to Hatem so Newton in Query Twenty-eight contemplated the mystery behind gravity which attracts star to star: What is there in places almost empty of Matter, and whence is it that the Sun and Planets gravitate towards one another, without dense Matter between them? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in vain; and whence arises all that order and Beauty which we see in the World? To what end are Comets, and whence is it that Planets move all one and the same way in Orbs concentrick, while Comets move all manner of ways in Orbs very excentrick; and what hinders the fix'd Stars from falling upon one another?50 Indeed, despite Goethe's opposition to Newton's theory of optics, they shared an awe of the forces of attraction and repulsion, Goethe referring to human, and Newton to natural phenomena. Like Wilhelm Meister, Suleika and Newton are puzzled by the mysterious connections of human and natural events. Although some events relate with regular- ity, as if so designed by a Divine Being, others seem only to occur at random, as if by accident. In any case, whether events occur at random or in a pattern, they gained the respect and admiration of both Goethe and Newton. 48 Goethe, Die Wahlverwandtschaften (WA), Pt. I, Vol. 20, p. 333. 49 Goethe, West-bstlicher Divan (WA), Pt. I, Vol. 6, p. 154. Although the emphasis of this poem is on the awesomeness of a force which would unite such a pair, interpretations are generally limited to Goethe and Marianne Willemer's close personal relationship and to their reference to the heraldic emblem which was the stimulus for the poem. While the emblem may have been the stiimulus for the poem, the language certainly symbolizes the tradition of atomism and emphasizes the attraction and acciden- tal meeting of both the sun and moon and Goethe and Marianne. 50 Newton, Opticks, p. 369.</page><page sequence="19">ATOMISM IN GOETHE'S WRITINGS 395 While it may be convenient to believe in the design and order of life, as it is expressed in Neoplatonism, it is certainly more realistic to accept the paradoxes of life, as expressed by Wilhelm Meister's teacher, Jarno. Serendipity and chance, as well as teleology and law, are facts of life and the flexibility which these two coexisting thought systems offer the individual does not solve anything, instead it creates problems and anxieties. At the end of the novel Wilhelm exclaims that his freedom has brought greater perplexities, although he is reassured that even larger paradoxes await him as he continues alone in search of his full human potential. In fact, the most perplexing paradox of all is that an active life of searching leaves little time for self-reflection and there are few who can master both at the same time: "Es sind nur wenige, die den Sinn haben und zugleich zur That fahig sind. Der Sinn erweitert, aber lahmt; die That belebt, aber beschrankt. "5 University of Kentucky 51 Goethe, Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre (WA), Pt. I, Vol. 23, p. 213.</page></plain_text>
