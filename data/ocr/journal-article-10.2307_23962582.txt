<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? Ν ο story from the Old Testament has had a greater impact upon the theology of the Christian Church and the art and literature of Western civilization than the story of 'man's first disobedience' in Genesis 3. The modern interpreter of this story, therefore, cannot but be aware of the great interpreters who have gone before him, and he may well wonder whether there is anything worth saying that has not already been said. None the less the fact is that the story continues to excite interest in a wide variety of ways, be it in popular debates about science and the Bible, the perennial debate about the origins and nature of evil, new approaches in the light of feminist or ecological perspectives, or simply the intrinsic fascination of the story in itself. Indeed, such is the profound and suggestive nature of the story that it would be in principle impossible for any one definitive interpretation to be produced. Some interpretations, however, are better than others, and it is my conviction that certain important aspects of the story have been neglected in many modern studies that has prompted me to produce my own attempt to shed fresh light upon the ancient text.1 Before starting, three preliminary points. First, I do not propose to discuss the classification of the story as myth, saga, folktale, or whatever. This is partly because these terms have been used in such a diversity of ways that they lack precise content unless carefully explained, and partly because I do not think that the Genesis material lends itself to any precise classification. Rather, I believe it will be more helpful simply to establish a correct general perspective on the story. This means recognizing that while the story is set in the context of the beginnings of human history, it is not actually told from that perspective but from the perspective of Hebrew life in the historical context of ancient Israel. This emerges most clearly through reflection upon the fact that the story is told in the mature language of classical Hebrew and embodies the developed concepts of classical Hebrew theology. Language is a social and cultural phenomenon which cannot 1 I am grateful to my friends and colleagues, D. Day, A. Gelston, C. T. R. Hayward, and G. J. Wenham for their helpful comments on a draft of this paper. The approach in this paper is in terms of a conventional historically orientated literary criticism. Those who are interested in how Gen. 2-3 might be understood in terms of structuralist perspectives should refer to Semeia, xviii (1980), all of whose articles are devoted to this topic. © Oxford University Press 1988 (Journal of Theological Studies, NS, Vol. 39, Pt. 1, April 1988] ) Oxford University Press 1988</page><page sequence="2">2 R. W. L. MOBERLY exist in isolation, nor can there be reflective theological thinking without an appropriate language to express it. Classical Hebrew language and theology therefore presuppose developed Hebrew culture. Such culture could not have existed in the story's own context, which is far removed from the Hebrew world of ancient Israel in both space and time.2 This has at least two implications. First, the story will of necessity illuminate primarily the cultural context within which it was written, rather than the primeval context in which it is set. Secondly, it will mean that it is appropriate to interpret the story in the light of a discriminating use of the rest of the Old Testament, as at least some of the rest of the Old Testament is presupposed by the story. Secondly, my concern is to read the text as far as possible as a coherent literary unity, in the belief that the meaning of most great stories can be grasped much more through close attention to the text as it is, than through possible reconstructions of how, when, and where the text came to be. This is, however, no easy undertaking with a text such as Gen. 3 which gives the impression of standing at the end point of a long and diverse history of reflection upon the issues and motifs that are central to it, and which may in certain respects only be explicable in the light of educated guesses as to what this history may have involved. Most obviously, for example, the tree of life, which is referred to in the introduction and conclusion (Gen. 2:9, 3: 22, 24) but is entirely absent in the main action of the story, gives the impression of being an interpretation of what is entailed by human obedience and disobedience to God that has been joined to the tradition yet not fully integrated into it.3 Moreover, the reference to the naming of Eve (3: 20) does not give the impression of being original to its present context.4 This means that any literary reading can explain only some and not all features of the text. None the less, while such difficulties must be recognized, I believe it is important to maintain the principle that any great work of literary art, such as Gen. 2 Before the advent of a critical historical awareness, it was naturally assumed by many that Hebrew was the original language of mankind. This was based on the combination of Gen. 2: 23 (Adam making a play on the Hebrew words for man and woman) and Gen. 11: 1 (only one language before Babel). See, for example, Rashi's comments on these verses (A. M. Silbermann (ed.), Pentateuch with Rashi's Commentary Commentary (Silbermann/Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul: Jeruslaem, 1973), pp. 12, 14). For a similar Christian understanding in ancient and medieval times, see, for example, J. N. D. Kelly, Jerome (Duckworth: London, 1975), p. 154and n. 7; B. Smalley, The Study of the Bible Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages (University of Notre Dame Press: Indiana, 1952, 1964), p. 362. 3 This is more fully discussed below, pp.14f and n. 39. 4 For further possible indications of the internal history of the narrative, see G. von Rad, Genesis (SCM: London, 1972: ET from German), pp. 98 f.; C. Westermann, Genesis 1-11 (SPCK: London, 1984: ET from German), pp. 186-96.</page><page sequence="3">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 3, has its own integrity and meaning, which must be respected; and that the integrity of the whole will transform and transcend the meaning of the possibly once-independent elements that have been incorporated into it. Thirdly, the primary object of this exercise is to read the story as a piece of ancient Hebrew literature in its ancient Hebrew context, which will require the exercise of both historical knowledge and historical imagination. However, the reason I am interested in the story is not simply the fact that it is a famous piece of ancient literature, but because I reverence it as part of holy scripture. This has at least three implications. First, it means that I, like many other commentators, interpret the story with at least half an eye on the hermeneutical question of its value and meaning for the believer today. This adds to the interest of the study—but it also carries the danger of reading into the story what one wants to read out from it. Secondly, it means that I regard it as important to escape from the notion that a story such as Gen. 3 has only one meaning. Meaning is determined by context, and the meaning of the story will naturally vary according as it is read within its ancient Hebrew context or within a Christian or Jewish context, and each of these three contexts is itself complex and variegated. All valid interpretations should surely in some way stand in continuity with the likely original meaning of the text, but their validity is determined by the way they genuinely utilize and illuminate aspects of the text in the light of their own general theological framework, rather than by any straightforward correspon dence to the supposed original meaning. Thirdly, I consider it important to take seriously the history of interpretation of the story within both Christian and Jewish contexts where it has always been read as scripture. For a modern Western Christian this means that one cannot avoid some engagement with the question of whether the classic interpretation of the story in terms of the 'Fall of Man' is a valid reading of the text, even though in a paper such as this one can only deal with the larger issues in the briefest of ways. The story of Gen. 3 must first be set within its immediate context of the narrative from Gen. 2:4 onwards. Yahweh God creates a man and puts him in a garden in Eden, a garden whose trees are of particular significance (2: 9). It is instructions with regard to these trees in 2: 15-17 that set the scene for chap. 3, and so it is here that the detailed study must begin. God gives the man a position of responsibility in the garden (v. 15; a role not dissimilar to that specified more generally in Gen. 1: 26-8). Within this setting the man is given a command (v. 16) and a prohibition (v. 17). There are several points of significance in this. First, the command, which although grammatically a command ('You</page><page sequence="4">4 R. W. L. MOBERLY shall eat') should no doubt be rendered permissively ('You may eat'), is remarkable for the freedom it gives; an emohatic verbal form is used (RSV(RSV 'You may freely eat': Heb. אצל תאכל), and the range of options given is as wide as it could be ('every tree', 'all the trees': מכל עץ). Secondly, within this wide-ranging permission, there is one prohibition, expressed in the emphatic form (לא rather than אל) as in the Decalogue. What exactly is meant by the 'knowledge of good and evil' which is prohibited is not made explicit in the text, and need not, I suggest, be an issue at this point.5 In the context of the story it is the fact of prohibition, rather than the content of what is prohibited, that assumes central importance. Thirdly, the penalty for doing what is prohibited is death. The emphatic verbal form used ('You shall surely die': מות תמות) is similar to the standard idiom for the death penalty in a legal context,6 and the identical expression is used elsewhere in a variety of contexts, usually with the imminent demise of the addressee in view.7 God's words therefore naturally mean an imminent termination of man's life if the prohibition is disobeyed. Fourthly, it is important to note that no reason is given by God either for his command or for his prohibition. There is no attempt at justification, such as 'It will be good/bad for you' (unlike the immediately following creation of woman which is introduced by 'It is not good for the man to be alone'). None the less, the story clearly assumes and implies that both the command and the prohibition are for man's good. Yahweh God who has made the man and the garden knows what is best for them, so that obedience to his words is entirely natural and proper. Fifthly, it is also important to note that the command and the prohibition are the first words of God to man,8 and so presumably are of fundamental importance for the relationship between them. In the light of these detailed points one can see that the situation in 2: 15-17 is surely an exact depiction of the general Old Testament 5 For discussion, see below, pp. 21-4. 6 e.g. Exod. 21: 15-17, Lev. 20: 9-16, cf. Gen. 26: 11, Exod. 19: 12. In these legal contexts the verb is invariably Hophal, מות יומת, with the literal sense 'be put to death'. 7 e.g. Gen. 20: 7, 1 Sam. 14: 39, 44, 22:16, 1 Kgs. 2:37, 42, 2 Kgs. 1:4, 6, 16, Jer. 26: 8. In all these instances the verb is Qal. On the difference between the Qal and the Hophal, F. Delitzsch comments, 'Hence it is said תמות [Qal], not תומת [Hophal] — death will not be a judicial execution, but a consequence involved in the nature of the transgression'transgression' (A New Commentary on Genesis, i (Τ. &amp;T. Clark: Edinburgh, 1888: ET from German), p. 139). 8 If one reads Gen. 2-3 independently of Gen. 1, then the words of 2:16-17 have the same sort of significance as 1: 26-8 as a general commission of God to man. If one reads Gen. 2-3 in its canonical position, then 2: 16-17's 'he first direct, personal address by God to man, in contrast to the blessing of 1:28 which is generalized and lacks the more intimate and specific setting of Gen. 2-3.</page><page sequence="5">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 5 understanding of man, especially Hebrew man,9 in the world. Man is given the dignity of a responsible role to fulfil, and he is to fulfil it through obedience to God's torah, his laws given for the guidance of life.10 Obedience is not automatic, for the possibility of life or death confronts man, and he must choose obedience if he is to live and avoid death. However, obedience is not seen as repressive or restrictive. Rather it lies at the very heart of Hebrew religion that freedom necessarily recognizes limits, limits which are specified in Torah, and which are good for man because they are God-given. It is this context of certain basic principles of Hebrew theology and ethics which, I suggest, sets the scene for chap. 3. Before we come to the main narrative there is the intervening paragraph concerning the creation of animals and of woman. At present we may simply note that this is integrated into the story as a whole, as it is one of the animals here created together with the woman who take centre stage as the story continues, and the concluding note about the nakedness of the man and the woman likewise sets the scene for what follows. The story continues with the introduction of the serpent, who is said to be cunning to an exceptional degree and is one of the creatures made by God. The significance of this characterization we will return to later. At present it will be appropriate to pass on swiftly with the narrator to the content of the serpent's words to the woman. First, it is unclear whether the serpent's words are a statement ('God has forbidden') or a question ('Has God forbidden?'). As the Hebrew stands it is more naturally a statement, but the rendering as a question is more subtle and does no violence to Hebrew idiom,11 and is, moreover, widely supported by the ancient versions and by the great majority of commentators both ancient and modern.12 The 9 It is likely that the distinctive situation of Israel should be seen as the presupposition underlying Gen. 2-3 as a whole; cf. K. Barth, Church Dogmatics III: 1 (Τ. &amp; T. Clark: Edinburgh, 1958. ET from German), pp. 240, 267 f., 273. 10 There might possibly be significance in the writer's choice of the verb 1צח״ in 2: 16. Cassuto comments, 'This is the first time that the verb to command appears in the Torah . . . serving as a symbol of, and introduction to, similar injunctions that were to be given to Israel in the future' (Commentary on Genesis, i (Magnes Press: Jerusalem, 1961. ET from Hebrew), p. 124). Likewise, there might possibly be significance in the fact that both the command and the prohibition concern food. This could be taken as suggestive of Israel's dietary laws, observance of which is a mark of Israel's unique relationship with Yahweh (cf. Lev. 11: 43-5, 20: 22-6). 11 It would be unnecessary to adopt the suggestion in BHS that an initial interrogative particle (ה) has been lost, presumably through haplography with the end of the previous word ΓΐΦΚΓΙ; cf. GK 150a. 12 For a denial that 3:1 is a question, seeE. A. Speiser, Genesis (Doubleday: Garden City, New York, 1964), p. 23; J. Walsh, 'Genesis 2: 4b-3: 24: A Synchronic Approach', JBL xcvi (1977), p. 164.</page><page sequence="6">6 R. W. L. MOBERLY rendering as a question is therefore preferable, although either way the general import of the serpent's words is not greatly affected. Secondly, the serpent's words are introduced by the idiomatic phrase אף כי which is acommonHebrewexpressionofemphasiseven though there is no exact parallel to its introductory usage here. It is important to maintain the emphasis by a rendering such as 'Has God really said?' or 'Is it true that God has said?' Next, we see that the serpent neatly reverses what God had previously said. God's words had emphasized freedom—the man could eat of every tree with only one prohibited. The serpent makes the prohibition universal. Instead of 'You may certainly eat from every tree of the garden' we have 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden' attributed to God. Why should the serpent say something which, as the woman duly points out, is clearly not the case? Apart from the fact that the serpent thereby engages the woman in debate, the main point lies presumably in the implication of the serpent's words. What matters is not that the serpent's words are obviously false, but that they imply that a total prohibition is the sort of unreasonable prohibition that one might expect from God, who is to be seen as more interested in restriction than in freedom. Such an innuendo is not dismissed simply by pointing out the obvious inaccuracy of the serpent's words. Finally, it may be significant that the serpent uses the bare term ׳Godאלהים) ׳) rather than 'Yahweh God' as is universally used in the surrounding "narrative (with the sole exception of the woman's response, which adopts the serpent's wording, and the serpent's further words in verse 5). The use of the personal name of God, Yahweh, could be seen as implying something of God's caring relationship to his people. If the serpent is implying that God is uncaring, the omission of God's personal name is a natural corollary. The woman's response to the serpent reaffirms God's permission to the humans to eat, but is worded differently. The verb, simply 'we may eat נאכל) ׳),, lacks the emphatic form of God's original permission (אכל תאכל)תאכל) , there is no reference to 'every' (כל) tree, and the death sentence, 'in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die', becomes simply 'lest you die'. Apart from this consistent weaken ing of God's words, the woman also increases the scope of God's prohibition by adding 'nor touch it'. It is difficult to decide how much significance is to be attributed to such variations. They could be simply a stylistic variation of purely literary significance.13 Tradi tional Jewish commentators, however, have usually seen significance 13 Some of the ancient versions tend to assimilate the woman's wording in 3: 2 to the wording of God's command in 2:16 (see BUS), which suggests that the translators were not aware of any particular significance here.</page><page sequence="7">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 7 in terms of the principle of Deut. 4: 2, Prov. 30: 6 of neither adding to nor subtracting from God's word,14 and I would judge that such an intuition is probably correct. It is not difficult to see the woman's answer as showing some uncertainty and lack of confidence in what God had said—hence her saying both less and more—and to connect this with the negative suggestion about God's character in the serpent's opening words. The serpent now replies and comes straight to the point. First, he flatly denies the explicit warning of God. God had said they would die, the serpent says they would not die.15 Secondly, the serpent says that the result of eating will be positive, not negative: (a) their eyes will be opened, an expression which elsewhere in the Old Testament has positive connotations of a new God-given quality of perception (e.g. Gen. 21: 19, 2 Kgs. 6: 17, 20); (b) they will be like God16 who knows good and evil,17 and this too picks up one of the positive fundamentals of Old Testament faith, that human nature finds its fulfilment in the imitation of God (so e.g. Gen. 1: 26-8, Lev. 19: 2).18 So the serpent is offering a prospect that is in principle entirely good and desirable. Thirdly, the serpent implicitly attributes a base motive to God for making the prohibition in the first place. The clear implication is that God acted out of fear and envy. Thus the silence about the motivation of the prohibition in 2: 17, which in that context was presumed to be for man's good, is given an entirely different slant by the serpent— repression, not benefit, was the reason. It will naturally follow from this that if an unworthy motive underlies the prohibition, then there will be little wrong in disobeying it. It is noteworthy that the serpent never tells the woman to transgress God's prohibition. He simply calls into question both God's truthfulness (by denying his warning) and God's trustworthiness (by impugning his motives) and leaves the woman to draw her own conclusions. 14 See Bereishis: Genesis/A New Translation with a Commentary Anthologized from Talmudic,Talmudic, Midrashic and Rabbinic Sources, vol. I, Artscroll Tanach Series (Mesorah Publications: New York, 1977), pp. 116 f. ls The unusual syntax of the serpent's words, לאימות תמתון rather than מות לא תמתוןתמתון is probably to be explained by the explicit recollection of the earlier words of God; cf. GK 113V. 16 The term אלהים could also mean 'gods', i.e. divine beings such as the members of Yahweh's heavenly court (cf. Gen. 3: 22; 1 Kgs. 22: 19-23; Job 1: 6, 2: 1), but in context a challenge to God himself seems more likely. 17 The phrase 'knowing good and evil' could be in grammatical agreement with 'you', i.e. the man and the woman, as well as with 'God', but the difference is only a matter of emphasis. 18 For a fascinating exposition of this important aspect of traditional Jewish theology, see M. Buber, 'Imitatio Dei' in his Mamre: Essays in Religion (Melbourne University Press: Melbourne &amp; London, 1946), pp. 32-43.</page><page sequence="8">8 R. W. L. MOBERLY The woman does draw her own conclusions. She looks at the forbidden tree and can only see that it looks good. It appeals to her physical senses ('good to eat', 'delight to the eyes'), and, moreover, it appears to promise positive enhancement of life ('to be desired to make one wise'). She can see nothing wrong, only something attractive and promising. So she takes and eats its fruit and her husband does likewise. Thus they disobey God's prohibition. And what is the result of this disobedience? In the light of God's original warning of death the reader would naturally expect punish ment to come in one of two ways. Either the tree would be deadly in itself and have a poisonous effect, or some penalty such as fire from Heaven or the earth swallowing them up would be inflicted. In fact neither of these happens. The divine death sentence is not executed. On the contrary, things turn out as the serpent said they would. Not only do the man and woman not die, as he said, but also their eyes are indeed opened, as he said. And later in the story God confirms that the man has indeed become godlike, knowing good and evil (3: 22), as the serpent said. Everything happens exactly as the serpent had said. Nor, moreover, is there anything obviously bad in the new kind of vision that the man and woman now possess. Clearly the fact of their nakedness, which their eyes had looked on before (cf. 2: 25), is now perceived in a new way, but their making loincloths for themselves need not be read as an action of sudden shame and confusion in any negative sense. We do not have to find here the fear subsequently engendered by the approach of God (3: 10). The Hebrews had a deep instinctive dislike of nakedness.19 The writer needed to add 'they were not ashamed' in 2: 25 to make clear that the nakedness of the man and woman was not something negative as the reader would naturally interpret it. Since the dislike of nakedness is never considered something negative or sinful elsewhere in the Old Testament,20 the natural Hebrew assessment of 3: 7 would surely be to regard the 19 Public exposure, particularly of one's private parts, was a matter of deep shame and distress (Gen. 9: 21-3; Exod. 20: 26; 2 Sam. 6: 20; Ezek. 16: 37; Lam. 1: 8), and the practice of stripping one's defeated enemy was a vivid symbol of his total humiliation (Isa. 20: 2-4, 47: 2 f; 2 Sam. 10: 4; 2 Chron. 28: 15; Mic. 1: 11). Consequently, nakedness also symbolized poverty and powerlessness (Isa. 58: 7; Hos. 2: 3 (Heb. 5); Job ι: 21, 22: 6, 24: 7, 10) and the provision of clothing symbolized care on the part of the giver and security for the recipient (Ezek. 16: 6-14; Hos. 2: 9 (Heb. 11); Gen. 3: 21). One can see a similar outlook in the New Testament also in passages such as Matt. 6: 30; 2 Cor. 5:3. 20 It is notable that even Yahweh's heavenly attendants, the seraphim, cover their private parts (Isa. 6: 2—following the customary interpretation of 'feet' as a euphemism for genitals, cf. Exod. 4: 25; Judg. 3: 24; 1 Sam. 24: 3 (Heb. 4)). Their action is part of a natural and proper reverence in the presence of God, without the slightest implication of guilt or fear.</page><page sequence="9">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 9 making of loincloths as something positive. As soon as the man and woman consciously realized their nakedness, they met the first situation of need they were confronted with in a constructive way. Their life does indeed appear to have been enriched. Before going any further in the story, we must pause to reflect on what we have just read. The whole story thus far has revolved around God's prohibition and the serpent's enticement to transgress it. God had said categorically that the man and the woman would die,21 and the serpent had said equally categorically that they would not die. And apparently the serpent was right, since they did not die. Moreover, God had at least implied that fullness of life came from obedience to him. The serpent had explicitly said that disobedience would bring enhancement. And again, apparently the serpent was right. How is one to account for this? Did God subsequently change his mind? Or was he simply wrong? The fact that apparently the serpent and not God spoke the truth is, I suggest, the central issue that the story raises. The crux for the interpreter must surely be the resolution of this remarkable anomaly, and the interpretation of the rest of the story will depend upon the decision made here. It is precisely here that many modern commentators seem to me unsatisfactory in their treatment. Westermann, for example, says, One must agree then with H. Gunkel and many others: "This threat is not fulfilled subsequently: they do not die immediately; this fact is not to be explained away, but simply acknowledged." Gunkel says that our difficulty with this was not felt so strongly by the ancient narrator, who would reply that God is and remains master of what he says. One must agree.'22 But must one in fact agree? At the very least such a claim about the standards of the ancient writer should be justified and not merely asserted; and while the text certainly should not be explained away, it does still need to be explained, and a recognition of the problem is not an explanation.23 Westermann himself concludes that the non-fulfilment of God's words is in fact essential to the narrative on the grounds that 'it shows that God's 21 The original prohibition was, of course, addressed to the man alone, but the woman is naturally presumed to be included in it as soon as she joins the man—thus the plural verbs in 3: 1—5. 22 Genesis, p. 225. 23 Gunkel himself does no more than cite Gen. 20: 3 as a parallel situation in which God threatens Abimelech with death but then mercifully allows him to live (Genesis (Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht: Gottingen, 1922), p. 10). This is, however, no true parallel, as not only does God insist that Abimelech first make an act of restitution (which would be the equivalent of repentance, though the text recognizes that repentance as such was not called for (20: 5, 6)), but also God requires that Abraham should pray for Abimelech (20: 7). Thus the story is closely conformed to the theological norms that we find elsewhere in the Old Testament, as outlined below.</page><page sequence="10">10 R. w. L. MOBERLY dealing with his creatures cannot be pinned down, not even by what God has said previously. And so even God's acts and words are open to misinterpretation and the serpent makes use of this.'24 But to say that God's dealings 'cannot be pinned down' and are 'open to misinterpretation' in no way meets the problem the text poses of God's words being positively false and misleading.25 The problem should not be watered down. Rather, it needs to be faced and assessed in the light of the Old Testament's own standards of divine consistency. Since much depends on whether or not the non-fulfilment of God's words would have been a genuine issue for the ancient writer, it is this that must be examined. The idea that God could apparently change his mind is not, of course, alien to Hebrew theology. On the contrary, there are many famous instances of God 'repenting',26 and not doing what he had said he would do.27 It should be noted, however, that God's words have this conditional quality because of their moral and relational nature. What God says is designed to elicit a response of obedience from man, and it is the nature of man's response that determines how God will act towards him. This is the principle classically enunciated in Jeremiah 18: 7-10: If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it. And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will repent of the good which I had intended to do to it. This principle is faithfully adhered to in every narrative which speaks of God repenting, with the addition of the other factor that the prayer of the faithful, as well as the repentance of the unfaithful, can move 2י Ibid., p. 225. 2s This was already an issue in the second century ad when Irenaeus (Against Heresies,Heresies, 5: 23) responded to gnostics who concluded that the Creator had been left powerless in the face of Wisdom, which spoke through the Serpent. For a discussion of Irenaeus' response and exegetical suggestions, see A. Orbe, 'Cinco exegeses ireneanas de Gen. 2, 17b adv. haer. V, 23, 1-2', Gregorianum, lxii (1981), pp. 75-113 (conveniently summarized in OT Abstracts, 4: 3 (1981), 222). 26 This traditional rendering is not entirely satisfactory, as 'repent' in modern English has moral overtones which are out of place with reference to God. But no alternative word or expression, such as 'regret', 'relent', or 'change one's mind' has the same flexibility of usage in English as 'repent', and so for convenience the traditional term will be retained here. 27 This important topic has received relatively little attention in modern Old Testament scholarship. For a recent discussion, see Τ. E. Fretheim, 'Divine Foreknowledge, Divine Constancy, and the Rejection of Saul's Kingship', CBQ xlvii (1985), pp. 595-602. Fretheim also provides a bibliography on the topic, p. 596 n. 3.</page><page sequence="11">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 11 God to modify his actions.28 Thus, for example, the sinfulness of humanity (Gen. 6: 5-7), the sin of the sons of Eli (1 Sam. 2: 17, 30), and the disobedience of Saul (1 Sam. 15: 11, 23, 26) all lead to God bringing disaster instead of the promised blessing. Conversely, the repentance of the men of Nineveh (Jonah 3: 7-10), Hezekiah's fear of God and prayer (Jer. 26: 18-19), the prayer of Moses (Exod. 32: n-14), and the prayer of Amos (Amos 7: 1-3, 4-6) all avert the judgement God had pronounced and secure his mercy. Such frequent language about divine repentance is a natural corollary of the profound Hebrew understanding of God's rela tionship with man as a genuine relationship, which involves and commits God as much as it involves and commits man. Moreover, a relationship between a moral God and varyingly obedient and disobedient man will necessarily involve paradoxes which Hebrew theology does not shrink from expressing in bold anthropomorph isms. The Old Testament does, however, recognize certain important limits upon its language about divine repentance. First, it is notable that usually the word for God repenting (DTtl) is not the word used for human repentance (שוב). This difference is regularly observed, and the words can be explicitly juxtaposed—when people repent (שוב), God repents (נחם) (Jer. 18: 8; Jonah 3: io).29 The practice of using a different word for God's repentance as opposed to man's repentance makes clear that any analogy betweeri them is only partial. Presumably the main point that is being safeguarded is the moral point that God does not need to turn from evil as man does. It is the dynamics of varying human response, not any struggle of his own with evil, that cause God to 'repent'. Secondly, there are two passages which deny that God does repent (Num. 23: 19; ι Sam. 15: 29). It is clear that neither of these is 28 The one apparent exception, as far as I am aware, is 2 Sam. 24: 16 where Yahweh 'repented of the evil' without being moved by either repentance or prayer. Perhaps the writer/editor is thereby making a point about the unique theological significance of Zion. Even here, however, one must presumably assume that David in v. 17 was unaware of the divine decision in v. 16. His confession of sin (v. 17) is prompted by his seeing the angel smiting the people (v. 15), not by seeing the angel stay his hand (v. 16); and the following narrative (vv. 21, 25) links the averting of the plague with David's repentance and sacrifice. Although, therefore, the text lays emphasis upon God's initiative in showing mercy, the overall theology of the passage is not significantly different from that elsewhere. 2י The distinction betweenΠΠ1 and שובis not absolute. ForGHlcan be used of man, sometimes in the sense of changing one's mind or having compassion (Exod. 13: 17; Judg. 21:6, 15) and sometimes in the sense of moral repentance (Jer. 8: 6, 31: 19; Job 42: 6), and 3Wcan be used of Yahweh (Jer. 4: 28; Joel 2: 14//J0nah 3: 9; Ps. 90: 13). When, however, שוב is used of Yahweh the sense is never that of moral repentance, but rather of responding flexibly to a situation in the sense indicated by חם!.</page><page sequence="12">12 R. W. L. MOBERLY denying the point already established about God's doings varying according to man's response, but are rather making the different point that God is never untruthful but always stands by what he has said. For in each passage the statement that God does not repent is parallel to the fact that he does not lie (לא איש אל ויכזב Num. 23: 19; 1 ,לא יש?ןר Sam. 15: 29), and in each passage the issue is God's faithfulness to his word (seeesp. Num.23:19b), in the one case God's irrevocable blessing upon Israel (Num. 23: 20-24), and in the other case his rejection of Saul which will lead to his choice of David (1 Sam. 15: 28). That is, God's choice of Israel and the house of David are at stake, and it is impossible that in his purposes of redemption God should ever go back on his word. It is worth noting that this sense of God not repenting in the sense of being false to his word is fundamental to Old Testament faith, and is not called in question by events apparently contradicting his word. God's apparent failure to honour his promises to Israel and the house of David is explicitly addressed in two of the most moving lament psalms (Pss. 44 and 89), neither of which ends with any word of hope or any resolution of the contradiction between what God has promised and what is actually happening. None the less, it is important that neither psalm therefore questions the truth of God's promise; the promise is affirmed, as are the events which go against it, and the psalmist's only solution is to cast himself upon God's steadfast love (חסד Ps. 44: 26 (Heb. 27), 89: 49 (Heb. 50)). Whatever the anguish of conflict between faith and circumstances, the possibility that God should prove false to his word is not seriously entertained. It is in the light of this consistent Old Testament understanding of the ways in which God does and does not repent that Gen. 3 must be read. While the Genesis writer would no doubt entirely accept Gunkel's point 'that God is and remains master of what he says', we have seen no evidence to suppose that he would draw Gunkel's corollary that God's sovereignty is ultimately arbitrary. On the contrary, the strong likelihood is that he shared with other Old Testament writers the conviction that God's sovereign freedom of action is always accompanied by a fundamental consistency of moral and redemptive purpose. It then becomes clear that human disobedi ence to God's explicit prohibition, as in Gen. 3, is not the kind of human response that could ever modify a word of judgement or lead God to repent of what he had said, even though some such divine repentance has often been suggested by commentators both medieval and modern.30 Rather, if God did not execute his death sentence upon 30 So, for example, Ibn Ezra, who significantly postulates that Adam must have repented first (Bereishis, p. 103). J. H. Hertz comments that 'in view of all the circumstances of the temptation, the All-merciful God mercifully modified the penalty,</page><page sequence="13">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 13 the man and the woman, then he would be guilty of repentance in the sense of proving false to his word. Is this conceivable in Gen. 3, when not only is the context set in Gen. 2: 15-17 that of some of the basic theological and ethical assumptions of the Old Testament, but also the setting of the story in its context at the beginning of Genesis—these were the first words of God personally addressed to man—makes it in some sense normative for the Old Testament as a whole?31 Furthermore, there is the question of whether it is conceivable not just that God could be wrong but that the serpent could be right. How is the reader expected to respond to the serpent? It is unnecessary here to explore the symbolic significance of the serpent in the ancient Near East generally, as two simple considerations will suffice for our purposes. First, elsewhere in the Old Testament, with the one notable exception of the brazen serpent made by Moses (Num. 21: 4-9), the serpent consistently represents hostility and threat to man,32 so much so that it will be one of the notable marks of a transformed world when this is no longer the case (Isa. 11:8). Secondly, this general Hebrew attitude is shared by the Genesis writer. For even though from the perspective of the story the enmity between mankind and the serpent still lies in the future (3:15), from the perspective of the writer and his readers such enmity is already an established fact. It is inevitable, therefore, that the known fact of enmity should colour the reader's response to the initial appearance of the serpent in the story. When one adds to this the obvious point that the serpent in Gen. 3 is deliberately undermining human obedience to God, there are clearly no grounds for the reader to regard the serpent as anything but a natural enemy. The conclusion that follows from this is that it is surely inconceivable that the Genesis writer could have allowed that in the situation of Gen. 3 the serpent could be right and God could be wrong. But how then are we to understand the text? I suggest that there is only one avenue of interpretation open to us, namely that God's death sentence was indeed carried out, but in some way other than the obvious and straightforward way that his words initially implied. If we look at the wording of his warning ('In the day that you and they did not die on the day of their sin' (The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, I: Genesis (OUP: London, 1929), p. 21); cf. J. Skinner, Genesis (Τ. &amp; T. Clark: Edinburgh, 1912), p. 67. But it is difficult to see what the mitigating circumstances might be. 31 Admittedly Israel could live with the apparent non-fulfilment of divine promises, as noted above, but that was hardly considered normative; and it is hard to escape the impression that Gen. 2-3 is intended as a normative portrayal of God's dealings with man. 32 See, for example, Gen. 49: 17; Exod. 4: 3; Isa. 14: 29; 27: 1; Jer. 8: 17; Amos 9: 3·</page><page sequence="14">14 R. W. L. MOBERLY eat of it you shall surely die') there are two elements which can without difficulty lend themselves to non-literal interpretation—'day' and 'die'; and indeed numerous non-literal interpretations of each have often been proposed. One ancient approach, for example, has been to appeal to Ps. 90: 4 (and 2 Pet. 3: 8) and so interpret 'day' as a 'day of God', that is, 1,000 years, that being the period during which Adam did die (after 930 years, Gen. 5: 5).33 Such a suggestion, however, is unnecessary for in fact ביום (lit. 'in day') is simply a common Hebrew idiom for 'when'.34 Thus the question whether 'day' is literal or not is beside the point.35 This means that we must focus on 'die' as the crucial term, and this anyway is what the text requires, for death was the substance of God's warning, and it was this that was flatly denied by the serpent. How then should 'you will die' be understood? Commentators have sometimes suggested some qualification such as 'you will deserve to die' or 'you will be doomed to die', but such guesses are unconvincing because they lack clear warrant in the text.36 Alternatively, commenta tors have argued that 'you will die' means 'you will become mortal',37 an argument which may be supported by appeal to the subsequent loss of the tree of life (3: 22). None the less, such a rendering is unsatisfactory for three reasons: (a) It implies that man in the garden was immortal, which is not even hinted at elsewhere in the text, 33 See, for example, Bereishis, pp. 102 f. This was already one of the options considered by Irenaeus (see n. 25 above). 34 Cf., for example, Gen. 2: 4, 5: 1,2; Exod. 32: 34; Num. 3: 1; 2 Sam. 22: 1; Isa. 11: 16. 35 The common usage of ביום is for DV to be in the construct before an infinitive, as in Gen. 2: 17, 3: 5. This means that although DT3 is itself indefinite (lit. 'in day'), it may become definite in sense ('in the day') since a suffix attached to the following infinitive makes the whole expression definite (cf. GK 127a). Thus the words ביום אכלך can mean 'on the day of your eating'. This meaning, however, is not absolutely required by the Hebrew (cf. GK 127ε), and if a writer wished unambiguously to ensure the sense 'on the day', it would be necessary to use the definite article with י1ם and employ a different construction, for example, ביום א?5ר תאכל. 36 A number of such suggestions are given in Bereishis, pp. 102 f., and Cassuto, Genesis,Genesis, pp. 124 f. See also Speiser, Genesis, p. 17. The best parallel for some such meaning would be the usage of מות תמות in Ezek. 33: 8, 14. There, however, the context requires such a meaning, which is not the case in Gen. 2: 17. 37 Jerome, for example, glossed Gen. 2: 17 with 'mortalis eris' {Liber Hebraic arum QuaestionumQuaestionum in Genesim: PL. XXIII, 308), and many other Christian commentators followed him. Even those not concerned to uphold this traditional interpretation may still argue for an interpretation in terms of becoming mortal; D. Jobling, for example, comments, 'All would be logical if 2: 17 were to read "you shall become mortal". Such a semantic "translation" is permissible and indeed necessary. To be transferred from the sphere of immortality to that of mortality is not much different in the semantics of myth from dying on the spot' ('The Myth Semantics of Genesis 2: 4b~3: 24', Semeia xviii (1980), 47).</page><page sequence="15">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 15 particularly in the crucial verse about the creation of man (2: 7).38 Even the reference to the tree of life does not indicate that man was immortal, only that he could have become immortal by eating its fruit, which, by implication ('lest he take also'), he had not yet done.39 (b) It becomes difficult to see what is the relevance of God's encounter and words in 3: 8-19 if they are not themselves the primary outworking of the threatened sentence, (c) There is the fact that the Hebrew words מות תמות תמות simply do not mean 'you will become mortal', but rather mean 'you will die'.40 One must conclude that when God said 'you will die', there is no reason to suppose that he did not mean what he said. 38 Τraditional Christian exegesis has argued for the original immortality of man not so much on the basis of Gen. 2-3 in itself as on the basis of the story when read in the light of the Pauline references to the introduction of death into the world through Adam's sin (Rom. 5: 12; 1 Cor. 15: 21). Death in these Pauline contexts has been interpreted as physical death, and the references to its introduction into the world have been taken to imply that there was a time when Adam was not subject to death. 39 Those who try to integrate the tree of life into the story as a whole have to deduce from the fact that only the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is prohibited that man could, and presumably did, eat from the tree of life; but that the tree only gave eternal life as long as one continued to eat from it, which was then made impossible by the expulsion. Such an interpretation is perfectly reasonable in itself, but unfortunately creates new problems. First, how can one reconcile 3: 3 which indicates only one tree, that of the knowledge of good and evil, in the middle of the garden, with 2: 9 which indicates that the tree of life was in the midst of the garden? It achieves little to argue that the 'middle' may refer to a general area which could have had more than one tree, for whether 'middle' is an exact spot or a general area the crucial fact remains that, were there more than one tree, the prohibited tree could not be identified in the way it is in 3: 3, solely by reference to its location. One is easily reduced to some rather bizarre speculation about two trees sharing a common trunk (see the discussion in Bereishis, p. 96). Secondly, 3: 22 clearly implies that the fruit of the tree of life worked in the same way as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; that is, one only had to eat of it once for its effect to be produced. The proposed integration again runs counter to the plain sense of the text. It might of course be argued that to seek a smooth integration of the tree of life into the story as a whole is to impose an anachronistic standard of literary coherence which is inapplicable to ancient traditional material. There is indeed force in such a consideration. None the less, I find it difficult to escape the impression that a certain overall realism and coherence was intended by the ancient writer(s), in the sort of way that makes the absence of the tree of life in 3: 3 a genuine difficulty. As indicated at the beginning, therefore, it is preferable to see the tree of life as an interpretation of the story (cast in the same narrative form as the story), rather than as an original part of it. For a sophisticated theological integration of the tree of life into the story as a whole, which does not, however, resolve the literary problem, see Barth, Dogmatics, III: 1, pp. 256 f., 276 ff. 40 It is in fact unclear how 'you will become mortal' would be expressed in biblical Hebrew, as biblical Hebrew does not have any adjective (or noun) corresponding to 'mortal'. But it does not follow from this that מות תמות would be as good a way as any of expressing it. The nearest the Old Testament comes to the phrase 'mortal man' is probably Isa. 51: 12, where 'mortal' is indeed expressed by ימות in the elliptical phrase</page><page sequence="16">16 R. W. L. MOBERLY It is at this point, when the various ways in which the sentence of death might be qualified all appear unconvincing, that most modern commentators have abandoned the attempt to reconcile what God said with what in fact happened. There remains, however, one way in which the problem might be resolved, and that is to interpret death itself in a non-literal, metaphorical way to signify something other than the termination of physical existence.41 The justification for such an approach is the fact that 'death' and 'life' are both terms that in religious and moral contexts are inherently suggestive of metaphorical senses in which they apply to the quality of human life, rather than its mere presence or absence. Such metaphorical, qualitative usage is well attested elsewhere in the Old Testament. In Deuteronomy, for example, life and death are set before Israel (Deut. 30: 15, 19), and while their meaning no doubt includes the literal sense of existence and non-existence, the primary concern of the text is the quality of life that will characterize Israel's occupation of the land. The fact that 'life' is linked with good and blessing, and 'death' with evil and curse, makes this clear. A similar usage of 'life' and 'death' is also common in the ethical instruction of Proverbs.42 Given such metaphorical usage elsewhere in the Old Testament, the question then is whether it is reasonable to apply such a sense to Gen. 3. It has already been noted that it is the Hebrew understanding of life under Torah, as classically expressed in Deuteronomy, that has set the context for Gen. 3 in Gen. 2: 15-17. There should be no אנה5 ימות. But the point in context appears to be the weakness and frailty of man in contrast to God, and so ימות is simply an expression of human limitation, not of some implied contrast to immortafity. Otherwise, since a phrase such as 5[ מות אתה would be ambiguous, an unambiguous expression would presumably neeci to be, say, 'your end will be death' (קצף מות), or 'you will not live for ever' (לא לעולם תחיה) neither of which, however, would fit well in Gen. 2: 17. In specific criticism of Jobling (see n. 37), J. G. Williams notes that the expression מות תמות 'is close to being a "performative": the speaking itself is to bring about whatTis predicated—unless the decree is lifted'. He further suggests that 'if 2: 17b meant "one doomed to die" it could have read we'akalta mimennu wemet [sic. perhaps rather ומת ] 'attah (see Exod. 12: 33; Deut. 17: 6; Gen. 44: 22). Although this would still be ambiguous, it is in keeping with a formula that is not a performative' (Ά Response to Jobling', Semeia xviii (1980), 52). In general, this difficulty in expressing 'you will become mortal' in biblical Hebrew should remined us that the idea of immortality, while not unknown (cf. Gen. 3: 22), plays no significant role in classical Hebrew theology, whose concern is almost exclusively with life under God on this side of the grave. A theology which understands this life explicitly within the context of the life to come or eternity only emerges at the end of the Old Testament period, and receives full expression in intertestamental and New Testament literature. 41 This is no novel suggestion, for it was often made by older commentators. See esp. Calvin's comments on 2: 17 (Genesis (Banner of Truth: London, 1965), pp. 127 f.). 42 So, for example, harlotry is a way of death, Prov. 5: 5L, 20-3, 7: 21-7.</page><page sequence="17">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 17 intrinsic objection, therefore, to the proposal that the metaphorical sense of death as a result of disobedience to Torah, such as in Deut. 30: 15, 19, may also be present in the Genesis narrative. At least it will be appropriate to see what is the result of reading the story in this light. As the story continues we see that, as soon as God appears, all in the garden is not well. Whereas previously God and the man had worked together closely (2:19, 22), now the sound of God inspires fear so that the man hides (3:8,10). Although the man had covered his nakedness (3:7), the approach of God makes that covering apparently worthless (3: ro). Whereas previously the man had delighted in the woman as 'bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh' (2: 23), he now refers to her as 'the woman you gave me' and shifts the blame on to her (3: 12). What we see is a degree of alienation and fear between the man and God, and the man and his wife, which did not exist previously. Both relationships have been poisoned by the act of disobedience. Thus the ancient writer is surely expressing the truth that evil, like good, brings its own reward. As the true reward of obedience is personal growth, so the true reward of disobedience is personal decay—a kind of dying instantly begins, even though this only becomes apparent in the presence of God.43 Furthermore, there follows a series of divine judgements. The serpent will be not just the most cunning (ערום) of creatures but also the most cursed (ארור), its crawling in the dust will become symbolic of this curse, and instead of conversing freely with the woman it will be in perpetual enmity with her and her descendants (3: 14 f.). The woman is to suffer inasmuch as in the two fundamental roles of ancient woman in which she should find her dignity and fulfilment, that is as wife and mother, she will now be subject to pain and domination (3: 16). The man likewise, in his fundamental role as farmer and food-producer, is subjected to pain and ceaseless toil; and the final pronouncement on the man who aspired to be like God is 'You are dust, and to dust you shall return' (3: 17-19). These words of judgement, which inflict penalties within the public life of the world, can be seen as complementary to the decay and death in the personal life of man, on the principle that there should be a correspondence 43 Westermann (Genesis, p. 252) sees underlying 3: 1-7 a primitive and partly magical understanding of the effect of a crime whereby 'the crime of its very self was the source of the harmful consequences to the one who perpetrated it', which gives way to the more advanced understanding of a personal and judicial process as in 3: 8 ff. By contrast, I would argue that it is in 3: 8-13 that we have the understanding of the crime as harmful in itself, and that this is not simply primitive or magical. Admittedly such an order of things is not in itself moral, but it is a presupposition for morality. The writer's portrayal shows a remarkably sophisticated grasp of the relationship between morality and integrity.</page><page sequence="18">18 R. W. L. MOBERLY between the personal and the public situation of man.44There may also be the point that since personal decay and death may be a process of which the person in question can be to a greater or lesser extent unaware, it is appropriate that there should be public consequences of which one cannot but be aware. Then finally man is expelled from the garden, which symbolizes removal in some way from God's presence. Since God's presence brings life (in normal circumstances), removal from his presence suggests a process of death. Moreover, the possibility of eternal life which was apparently open to man in his initial situation in the garden is removed from his grasp. While obedience to God had in some way contained the potential for eter nal life, disobedience makes that deep human longing unattainable; death in the literal sense, as well as the metaphorical, will be man's lot. If this interpretation is on the right lines, how does it affect the assessment of the story as a whole? What we have is a study of how a person is tempted to disobey God's Torah, and what are the consequences of such disobedience. The serpent's words to the woman are a brilliant portrayal of the psychology of temptation. The woman's trust in the goodness of God's prohibition is subtly undermined until the way of life and fulfilment appears to lie in disobedience. The main point then comes in the consequences of such disobedience. For what one would naturally expect would be immediate retribution in the form of physical death. This was the clear implication of God's initial warning, and such retribution is certainly found elsewhere in the Old Testament.45 But the writer's concern is with the fact that, in general, disobedience to God does not meet with any such penalty, and that therefore the relationship between human disobedience and divine judgement is to most appearances ambiguous. This problem was often faced by the prophets,46 and is indeed inherent in the whole understanding of a God whose way of life for man has been expressed in the gift of Τorah. The point, therefore, is precisely that it is often the case that apparently God is wrong and the serpent is right, that is that Torah can be disregarded and disobeyed with impunity. The Genesis writer wants this to be fully appreciated. None the less he also wants to show that such impunity is in fact superficial and illusory. This he achieves by inviting the reader to see that death may be real in a qualitative sense in both the personal and public life of man. The story is thus first 44 Order and disorder in the moral and natural realms are frequently connected in the Old Testament; see, for example, Deut. 28; Hos. 4: 1-3; Ps. 72. 45 e.g. Gen. 6: 5-7; Exod. 32: 35; Lev. 10: 1-2; Num. 16, 21: 5 f.; Jer. 28: 15-17. 46 e.g. Isa. 5: 19; Jer. 17: 15; Zeph. 1: 12.</page><page sequence="19">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 19 and foremost a profound study of the nature of morality and integrity in the Hebrew context of living by Torah.47 An interpretation along these lines, whatever may be its weaknesses in detail, does offer a coherent reading of the story as a whole, and is, as far as I can see, the only way of making sense of God's words and actions that is consistent with the rest of the Old Τestament and with the story's own normative setting at the beginning of Genesis. Does it, however, raise any particular difficulties of its own? One will be briefly considered.48 This is the difficulty posed by the words of curse and judgement in 3:14-19. For these do not sound like a description of what is true only when mankind is disobedient to God, but as a description of the constant and unchanging experience of life of the ancient Hebrew. The divine words apparently describe regular conditions, rather than conditions which only apply when man is disobedient, and as such it is unclear how well they illustrate the moral point at issue. It should be noted here that it has sometimes been proposed that the story originally existed in a shorter, simpler form in which the act of disobedience was followed directly by expulsion from the garden, symbolizing alienation from God.49 Since such a form of the story would closely fit the interpretation we have proposed, our analysis would tend to support the hypothesis of the story's growth in this way. One may conjecture at least two reasons why the words of curse and judgement were added to the tradition. First, a desire to make explicit the link between human disobedience and the painful realities of daily life, in the sort of way that is common elsewhere in the Old Testament.50 Secondly, a concern to link the story of Gen. 2—3 to the 47 This understanding of personal deterioration as the most serious consequence of wrongdoing is extensively developed in the New Testament, especially the Johannine writings. It is an insight that is also shared by moralists who do not stand in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. For a discussion of the whole issue, see Sir W. Moberly, The The Ethics of Punishment (Faber: London, 1968), chaps. 6-9, esp. pp. 178-85, 204—11. 48 One issue, which is not as such a difficulty but which touches on an interesting and obscure area, is the relationship of Gen. 2-3 to Deuteronomy. There are two notable affinities. First, there is a similar Torah theology (see esp. Deut. 30: 11-20). Secondly, there is a significant wisdom element in Gen. 2-3 in its concern with the limits of knowledge and a right relationship to creation (cf. W. Brueggemann, Genesis (John Knox Press: Atlanta, 1982), p. 51); and it is also in Deuteronomy that there is a marked convergence between Τorah and Wisdom (e.g. Deut. 4: 6, 29: 29). Both these affinities are with material in Deuteronomy (Chaps. 4, 29-30) that are generally considered to represent a distinctive editorial contribution to the book. At the same time, however, there is a complete absence in Gen. 2-3 of the terminology and expressions characteristic of Deuteronomy. The possible implications of all this for the date and life-setting of Gen. 2-3 will best be left for another occasion. 49 See Westermann, Genesis, pp. 195, 256 f. 50 Cf. n. 44 above.</page><page sequence="20">20 R. W. L. MOBERLY wider context of the primeval history, the motif of the curse upon the ground being one of several factors that skilfully link the originally independent stories of the primeval history (compare 3:17 with 4:11, 5: 29, 8: 21). When one considers the text with 3: 14-19 as an integral part, it is clear that the regular painful conditions of ancient life are being seen as consequent upon human sin. If one asks whose sin in particular is envisaged, the answer must be either the one sin of the man and the woman, or the sin of everybody in every generation. The difficulty with the first of these is that the story as a whole gives the impression of being a portrayal of what is generally true, rather than what was true on one particular occasion: moreover, the punishment would hardly fit the crime, which would seem inappropriate given the exemplary concern of the text as a whole. The condition of the world, therefore, is presumably to be seen as the result of the constant disobedience of mankind. Such an understanding of human nature as constantly disobedient to God need not be alien to the concerns of the story, for precisely this point is made by the flood narrative (esp. Gen. 6: 5, 8: 21). There the writer (generally considered to be the same as in Gen. 2-3) stresses that the regular condition of mankind is that of being disobedient to God and deserving of judgement (as in the flood), even though he equally makes the point that it is undeserved mercy that man normally receives.51 It is significant that in 8: 21 the cursed state of the ground is specifically connected with general human sinfulness,52 which would support the contention that the same point is also present in Gen. 3. We find that the story in fact contains two distinct points, depending upon how one reads it. If one takes the story as a whole, then the words of judgement in 3: 14-19 are part of what happens when when man is disobedient. If one takes the words in 3: 14-19 in their own right, they show that man is disobedient. The former reading implies that disobedience is not inevitable—obedience to Torah is a real possibility for man (cf. Deut. 30: 11-14). The latter implies that disobedience is in fact universal. Although there is a certain tension between these points, their conflation in the text can be understood in the same sort of way as one of the theological paradoxes of the flood narrative. There, although man is universally sinful (Gen. 6: 5), Noah finds favour in the eyes of God (6: 8) and is explicitly said to be righteous (6: 9).53 Even more strikingly, God's final pronouncement 51 For the interpretation of these verses, see my At the Mountain of God, JSOTS 22 (JSOT Press: Sheffield, 1983), pp. 91-3, 113-15. 52 The position of צוד in 8: 21a means that it qualifiesV^Vand not לא־אסף( as it does in 8: 21b), and must mean that the curse remains valid but will not be added to. 53 A recognition of the possible compilation of distinct sources should not mean that</page><page sequence="21">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 21 of the enduring sinfulness of man's heart (8: 21) must, in terms of the story, refer primarily to Noah himself and his family, even though Noah at the time is offering an acceptable sacrifice. Such a paradoxical assessment of man as profoundly sinful and yet also capable of true obedience to God is clear in the flood story. I propose that Gen. 2-3 should be read in a similar way. The main thrust of the story is the demonstration of the kind of death that disobedience to God entails, and the paradoxical point about human nature lies in the background. None the less, the paradox is present in the text. This well illustrates the methodological point that, although the text can and should be read as a whole, the text does none the less contain emphases which are best appreciated when the likely historical development of the text is taken into account. Finally, it will be appropriate to consider certain points of detail that were previously passed over but which touch on some of the larger issues that the story raises. First, there is the question of the importance that should be attached to the fact that the forbidden fruit was on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.54 Despite the inherently suggestive nature of the phrase 'the knowledge of good and evil', it is unclear whether it is as significant as is sometimes supposed. Enormous energy has been expended upon elucidating the meaning of the phrase, but the results are somewhat disappointing, mainly because Gen. 2-3 leaves the meaning of the phrase open—apart from the awareness of nakedness in 3: 7 the text gives no clear indication of the way in which the man and woman become more knowing than they were before. Gen. 3 certainly implies that knowledge of good and evil is a regular feature of the human condition (so esp. 3: 22), but attempts to pinpoint its meaning suffer from exactly the same problems as attempts to pinpoint the meaning of the 'image of God' in man (Gen. 1: 26)—the suggestive and elusive nature of the phrase gives the interpreter great scope to read his own understanding of humanity into it. Although one might hope that the question could be resolved on the basis of usage elsewhere in the Old Testament, it is unclear both how far usage of 'good and evil' elsewhere is consistent, and whether or not apparent parallels to Gen. 3 are true parallels. The content of the paradox of the completed text is thereby explained away. In any case, the Ρ material in Gen. 6:9-22 itself specifies that 'all flesh' was corrupt (6:12), as well as affirming that Noah was righteous (6:9), and so contains the paradox within itself in exactly the same way that the J material does (6: 5, 8). 54 For discussion and bibliography with regard to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, see Westermann, Genesis, pp. 240 ff.</page><page sequence="22">22 R. W. L. MOBERLY 'knowing good and evil', for example, can be moral awareness,55 but it can also be the non-moral ability to distinguish between what is pleasant and unpleasant.56 At least one point, however, does seem clear. This is that knowledge or discernment of good and evil is characteristic of maturity and adult life, and is lacking in small children (Deut. 1: 39; 1 Kgs. 3: 7, 9), or someone whose advanced age has brought on'second childishness and mere oblivion'(2 Sam. 19: 35 (Heb. 36)) .57 On the assumption that this usage is a genuine parallel to that in Gen. 3, it is these references to adult awareness that have provided much of the exegetical basis for the widespread modern reinterpretation of Gen. 3 whereby the story portrays the painful but necessary transition from childish innocence and transparence to adult awareness and experience which is marked by profound ambiguity—a 'fall upwards'.58 Further justification for such a reading of the text is an apparent parallel in the most famous story outside the Old Testament to have survived from the ancient Near East—the Epic of Gilgamesh.59 The story of Enkidu in the early part of the Epic contains some interesting echoes of motifs in Gen. 3. Enkidu, the primitive wild man who lives with the animals is seduced by a prostitute with the result that he loses his familiarity with the animals and enters the world of civilized man. The narrator comments that Enkidu 'now had wisdom, broader understanding', and the prostitute says to him 'Thou art wise, Enkidu, art become like a god.'60 However, later Enkidu has to die and ss So Deut. ι: 39, where the point seems to be that the children of the Israelites are not yet morally responsible and so do not share in the guilt of their parents. 56 S02Sam. 19: 35 (Heb. 36), where Barzillai is no longer able to enjoy the pleasures of adult life. In Isa. 7: 15-16 it is uncertain whether 'refusing the evil and choosing the good' means incipient moral awareness, i.e. when the child could begin to know what it ought or ought not to do, or simply the ability to express likes and dislikes of what it eats. 57 An apparent exception may be Isa. 7: 15-16 where the Immanuel child's capacity to 'refuse the evil and choose the good' is probably envisaged as taking place within a relatively short time, perhaps two years, after its birth; that is while the child is still a child and not yet an adult. Yet even here the point is that this capacity must be grown into. 58 So, for example, S. R. Driver, 'They had passed in a moment—as we all pass, though only in the course of years—from the innocence of childhood into the knowledge which belongs to adult age' (Genesis (Methuen: London, 1904), p. 46); cf. J. R. Lucas, 'There is an account of our moral and spiritual maturation from a state of innocence to a state of adult autonomy. . . . We are impelled to seek the knowledge of good and evil, however much it may hurt us. It is part of our development to adulthood, part of our becoming rational agents' ('The Origin of Sin' in his Freedom and Grace (SPCK:(SPCK: London, 1976), p. 43). 59 See J. B. Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the OT (Princeton University Press: Princeton, 1969), pp. 72 f.; also Ν. K. Sandars (ed.), The Epic of Gilgamesh,Gilgamesh, Penguin Classics (Penguin: Harmondsworth, 1964, 1972). 60 Tablet 1. iv, lines 29, 34 (ANET, p. 75).</page><page sequence="23">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 23 he curses the prostitute, apparently (though this is unclear) because she had set him on this path leading to death.61 The whole Epic of Gilgamesh displays a deep awareness of the limitations and ambi guities of human existence, and Enkidu's ambiguous entry into wisdom and civilization is an important part of this. Given certain similar motifs,62 one might suppose that the Hebrew story is making the same sort of point as the Mesopotamian story.63 It must certainly be admitted that the Genesis story does in some ways lend itself to this sort of interpretation. Such an interpretation is also particularly congenial to a twentieth-century culture that is familiar with both Freudian psychology and existentialism. None the less, as a serious interpretation of Gen. 3 it cannot be sustained.64 Primarily, this is because of the centrality to the Genesis story of prohibition, disobedience, and death, as outlined above. The knowledge of good and evil is something deadly for man, not a painful but necessary part of his development. On this proposed reading, one would have to allow that the serpent was right, especially in his insinuation that the prohibition was not for man's good, but that God was holding back something desirable. Such an implication about Torah would be intolerable for any Hebrew who accepted Torah as God's good and life-giving will for Israel. Moreover, the oft-revived suggestion that the condition of the man and the woman before they took the fruit was essentially that of a child is unlikely. Our analysis of 2:15-17 as depicting the basic condition of Hebrew man (that is, an adult living responsibly under Torah) tells against it, as does the significance attached to nakedness in 2: 25, 3: 7.65 Also, in the parallel account of the king of Tyre (Ezek. 28: 12—19) the key figure is an adult, as is Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgamesh or Adapa in the Myth of Adapa.66 The meaning of 'the knowledge of good and evil' is not therefore 61 Tablet νπ. iii, lines 5-10 (ANET, p. 86). 62 The parallels with the Enkidu story become even more striking if one suggests, as has often been done, that either the transgression in Gen. 3 (in some earlier form of the story) or the resultant awareness is to do with sexuality. For a survey of such suggestions, see Westermann, Genesis, p. 243; J. A. Bailey, 'Initiation and the Primal Woman in Gilgamesh and Genesis 2-3', JBL lxxxix (1970), pp. 144-7. 63 One might note also that the theme of humanity's development through a painful transition from simplicity to complexity is well known in Greek mythology, for example, the stories of Prometheus and Pandora. 6464 Insofar as a transition from simplicity to complexity is a genuinely significant element in Gen. 3, it could be indicative of the tradition-history of the story. The writer could have deliberately transformed a story that was initially more similar in outlook to that of Enkidu or Pandora, in order to highlight the distinctive theological understanding of life entailed by Hebrew faith in Yahweh. 65 Cf. Westermann, Genesis, p. 235. 66 See ANET, pp. 101—3.</page><page sequence="24">24 R. W. L. MOBERLY resolved by usage elsewhere in the Old Testament or by apparent similarities in other ancient texts. If one allows the context of the Genesis story itself to be the decisive factor in determining the details of the story, it would appear most likely that 'knowledge of good and evil' signifies moral autonomy, that is the adoption of a stance whereby one decides right and wrong for oneself rather than in obedience to divine Torah.67 Or if, as is often argued, 'knowledge of good and evil' means knowledge of everything, moral and non-moral alike,68 the meaning would be that of autonomy generally. Either way, the point is similar that acquisition of such knowledge means stepping out of the position of creaturely dependence and trust in the creator. Such an autonomous stance could well be what the Genesis writer saw as the general stance of mankind and also as the fundamental root of mankind's problems. Next, there is the question of the serpent and the problem of evil. Although the serpent is the agent of disobedience and is hostile to man, the serpent itself is not described as evil. This is no doubt because of the strong Hebrew sense that all that God had created was good, and the serpent is specifically one of the creatures that Yahweh God had made (3: 1, cf. 2: 19, 20). To characterize the serpent as evil in this context would imply that God had created evil, and despite the theoretical puzzle that the existence of evil poses for monotheism, mainline monotheistic theology, both Jewish and Christian, has always resisted ascribing to God the creation of evil. The writer of Gen. 3 shares this resistance and simply bypasses the theoretical problems that evil poses. The serpent is described not as evil but as the most cunning (ערום) of the creatures God had made, and two possible reasons for the writer's choice of this term can be discerned. First, the most obvious point to a reader of the Hebrew text is the play on words between the serpent as ערום (cunning) and the man and woman as ערום (naked)!69 Presumably the point of such word play is to introduce a sense of pleasure at the narrator's skilful use of language, and serves to remind the modern reader that Hebrew literature is rarely purely functional or didactic, but is to be enjoyed as well as profited from.70 67 So, for example, W. M. Clark, Ά Legal Background to the Yahwist's Use of "Good and Evil" in Genesis 2-3',JBL lxxxviii (1969), pp. 266-78. 68 So, for example, von Rad, Genesis, p. 89. 69 This point depends upon the juxtaposition of 2: 25 with 3:1. Elsewhere (3:7, 10, 11) the alternative form of the adjective, עירם is used. Had עירם been used in 3: 1, the word play would have been diminished. 70 The word play is also a standing temptation to commentators to exercise their ingenuity and imagination. So, for example, G. W. Coats speculates about a possible earlier form of the tradition 'that casts the tempter not as a naked (wise) snake, but as a</page><page sequence="25">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 25 Secondly, a study of the use of ערום elsewhere in the Old Testament is revealing. The word appears to be used in two ways.71 The most frequent usage is in Proverbs, where it is invariably a good and commendable quality—'prudent' or 'shrewd'.72 Outside Proverbs, however, the word is never clearly good or commendable and should probably always be rendered 'cunning' or 'crafty', that is a quality that is inherently ambiguous from a moral perspective; for cunning naturally arouses both admiration and suspicion.73 It is surely not the usage of ערום in Proverbs but that elsewhere in the Old Τestament that explains the writer's choice of the term for the serpent. The serpent is not evil as such but is possessed of a morally ambiguous quality that easily lends itself to evil. Thus the depiction of the serpent ignores the theoretical issue of how God's good creation can become evil, but rather illustrates the disastrous consequences of a classic misuse (for reasons unstated) of a rather unusual and ambiguous God-given quality. With regard to the theological problems posed by the existence of evil, it is worth remembering that most of those earlier commentators who were happy to read Gen. 3 as literal history still recognized that the story at best showed the first appearance of evil in the world but left unresolved the more fundamental issue of how such evil could exist in the first place. The traditional answer was to trace evil and the Fall back to some premundane catastrophe.74 On any reckoning, therefore, Gen. 3 leaves the fundamental enigma of evil unresolved. It is rather a classic picture of what disobedience to God involves and entails, which is certainly compatible with a traditional doctrine of the Fall but is not itself the basis for it.75 naked (and wise) woman (cf. the Gilgamesh Epic)' (Genesis, with an Introduction to Narrative Narrative Literature, FOTL 1 (Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 1983), p. 58). 71 For these purposes it is unnecessary to distinguish between the adjective and the related noun and verb. 72 Prov. 1: 4, 8: 5, 12, 12: 16, 23, 13: 16, 14: 8, 15, 18, 15: 5, 19: 25, 22: 3, 27: 12. 73 Saul says of David that he needs to be watched carefully as he is 'very cunning' (1 Sam. 23: 22), and the Gibeonites deceive the Israelites by employing crafty tactics in the way that the Israelites themselves had done previously at Jericho and Ai (Josh. 9: 3 f.). Cunning could easily be harnessed in murdering someone (Exod. 21: 14), and it is clear from Job that ערום can designate a kind of human intelligence that is opposed to God and so brought low by him (Job 5: 12, 13, 15: 5). 74 See, for example, N. P. Williams, The Ideas of the Fall and of Original Sin (Longmans: London, 1927). 75 The doctrine of the Fall is an issue of pure theology, which is necessitated by two basic convictions; first, that God is good and whatever he creates is likewise good, and secondly, that the condition of the world as we know it is of good that is corrupted and distorted by evil and so in need of God's salvation. The Fall is the traditional explanation of this paradoxical situation. If one resists the notion that evil is somehow inherent in creation, as is often suggested, and maintains the traditional Christian understanding of evil as a corruption of original good, then one is apparently forced to</page><page sequence="26">26 R. W. L. MOBERLY Finally, there is the question of the relationship between the meaning of the story in its Hebrew context and its meaning in the context of traditional or contemporary Christian theology. This is best approached through reflection upon the fact that Adam is clearly 'everyman', a point made both by his name,76 and by the context of the garden of God in which he is set, a context which is impervious to the usual divisions and distinctions of human life. Although the shape of the story is moulded by the presuppositions of Hebrew theology, these presuppositions are not allowed to obtrude upon the universality of the story. Thus, for example, although 2: 15-17 is shaped by Τorah theology, the actual term 'Torah' is not used, for it specifies what is God's special gift to Israel alone. The narrator has so presented his material that it can be read in the light of any authentic moral code. Christian theology, which does not see the pattern for life as constituted by Torah, and which has a more complex understanding of the place of moral codes than does the Old Τestament, none the less still recognizes the importance of the commandments of both Old Testament and New Testament and the centrality of obedience and trust. Moreover, the metaphorical sense of death as alienation and estrangement and the understanding of eternal life as inherent in a right and obedient relationship with God are both likewise congenial to Christian theology. The story thus naturally lends itself to transposition into a Christian context. It is also no surprise to a modern Western reader that this archetypal story of human sin should include reference to the effects of sin upon man's natural environment, a fact which give the story an immediate relevance to one of the pressing problems facing modern society. However, the precise way in which the text envisages the earth being affected, through a divine curse, is somewhat problematic, and a thorough study of the meaning of this within its Hebrew context is necessary before the hermeneutical issue can be properly tackled.77 In conclusion, it is not difficult to see not only why the story of Gen. 3 has had such an impact in the past, but also why it is important that the story should still be heard today. Sadly, in much popular thought the waters have been muddied by misleading debates about the maintain that evil is not eternal but originated within the sphere of time, i.e. that in some sense there was an historic Fall—though in saying this the inadequacy of traditional categories for comprehending the nature of this profound mystery must be stressed. Whatever one's resolution of the mystery, however, the point is that it is entirely a matter of the examination and explication of fundamental theological principles. 76 Hebrew אדם, like Latin 'homo' or English 'man' is a generic term for mankind. 77 For a recent discussion of the bearing of the early chapters of Genesis upon ecological issues, see B. W. Anderson, 'Creation and Ecology' in his (ed.) Creation in the Old Testament (Fortress Press/SPCK: Philadelphia/London, 1984), pp. 152-69.</page><page sequence="27">DID THE SERPENT GET IT RIGHT? 27 relationship between science and the Bible and also by the popular pejorative sense of the term ,myth'. This means that the intelligent appropriation of the story in contemporary theology will not always be straightforward. None the less one can feel confident that the profound and suggestive qualities of the story should enable the story in itself to prove both more enduring and more interesting than all the various debates and commentaries that become attached to it.
