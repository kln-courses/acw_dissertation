<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yuquot, the summer village of the Moachat Nootka, is situated on the southeastern tip of Nootka Island bor- dering the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Surrounded by the unpredictable waters of the Pacific Ocean and covered by thick stands of towering conifers, the mountainous area is rain drenched, often foggy and stormy, but temperatures rarely reach extremes because of the moderating influence of the Japanese Current. Long fiords permit access to the sheltered interior sites where the people of Yuquot spent the fall tak- ing and preserving large quantities of salmon and the winter performing their impressive ceremonials. YUQUOT: Where the Wind Blows 27 6</page><page sequence="2">BY WILLIAM J. FOLAN and JOHN T. DEWHIRST from All Directions On the afternoon of August 8 , 1774 , a group of Nootkans at their seaside village of Paisista sighted what they first thought to be a huge thunderbird far out at sea. As it drew near, the Nootkans rein- terpreted the apparition as a large canoe returning some of their dead chiefs , but closer inspection re- vealed a group of strangers . Finally some Noot- kans paddled out to the strange craft and ex- changed gifts with its crew . Then a storm blew up, causing the vessel to seek the safety of the high seas , leaving behind a legend of strange men in an equally strange craft . Thus , Nootka Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Co- lumbia was discovered by Lt. Commander Juan Perez of the Spanish frigate Santiago. He was re- turning from an historic voyage up the Northwest Coast of America to establish Spanish claims to this unexplored area threatened by the southward expansion of Russian fur traders operating in Alaska. The importance of the region to history and prehistory attracted the National Historic Sites Service of Canada to investigate the enormous midden at Yuquot, a Moachot Nootkan village located in one of the last archaeological frontiers of North America. Nootkans and Europeans began prolonged con- tact in 1778 when Captain James Cook, commander of the H.M.S. Resolution and H.M.S. Discovery, on his third and last voyage of exploration, explored the Nootka Sound region and traded European goods for Indian masks, weapons, hunting and fishing gear, foodstuffs, clothing and various pelts, including those of the valuable sea otter, the procurement of which became a major motivation in the early exploration of the Northwest Coast. Much of the written and graphic descriptions that the crews made of their Nootkan hosts is on file in several British archives, and native objects collected grace several European museums. This mountain of material has enabled us to describe accurately the Nootkans before they experienced in- tensive contact with European and American explorers and traders. Cook received a friendly welcome at Yuquot, lo- cated on the slope and crest of a high refuse midden rising from a gravel spit which formed the western- most perimeter of Friendly Cove. The houses were built of permanent log frames covered with planks when the village was occupied during the spring and 277</page><page sequence="3">Cook and the members of his crew wrote detailed descrip- tions of the different facial decorations, hair arrangements and ear and nose ornaments common to Nootkan men. The man in this Webber portrait is shown with a series of squares stamped on his forehead, a red ochre patch at his temple, and red ochre shading on the lower half of his face. He has groomed his hair with oil or grease and at- tached false braids ending in tassels, a rolled copper cyl- inder and two shell or copper ornaments. Courtesy of die Dixson Library, Sydney. In this study, the subject's forehead is decorated with wavy black lines meeting at the middle marked by an inverted "V" above the bridge of his nose. As in the drawing to the left, there is a patch of red ochre at his temple, but instead of uniform shading of the entire lower part of his face, the cheeks are decorated with wavy red lines. His hair is oiled, supplemented with false braids and liberally coated with red ochre. His only other orna- ment is a nose ring. Drawing by John Webber; courtesy of Farquhar Collection. YUQUOT continued</page><page sequence="4">Although Nootkan women were said not to paint de- signs on their faces in 1778, they did coat their skin and hair with a mixture of oil and red ochre. This woman is wearing a flat topped hat decorated with a long tassel and a zoomorphic design. Nootkan women wore a wrap-around cedar bark skirt and a one-piece mantle, also made of cedar bark, which they slipped over their heads. The neck of this garment was fre- quently trimmed with fur and the lower edge fringed with strips of cedar bark. Drawing by John Webber; courtesy of Farquhar Collection. In 1791, an artist with the Alejandro Malaspina ex- pedition sketched the most famous Nootkan, Chief Maquinna. Although he is shown without any painted facial decoration, he does have a moustache and a rather sparse goatee. His conical hat is topped by a pear-shaped protuberance (a mark of rank) and dec- orated with two whaling scenes. Nootkan legend and other clues suggest that Cook and Maquinna met in 1778, but attempts to link Maquinna with earlier de- scriptions of unidentified chiefs are tenuous. Courtesy of the Museo Naval, Spain. During one of Cook's visits to Yuquot, John Webber drew the first graphic record of the village. Two rows of large plank houses are built on a refuse midden above the beach and on the beach a small shed-like structure is built against the midden. A log "porch" and walkway are visible in front of two dwellings in the center of the drawing and sev- eral herring spawn drying racks are scattered between the structures. Several prerogatives of rank and status are also depicted: the upright, uncarved pole standing in front of the second house from the left; the exterior post and lintel feature supporting the roof beams of the center structure; and the large beams laid on the roofs of the large structure on the right and the smaller one left of center. The oval openings through the wall planks of two of the structures may also indicate status. In the right foreground is one of Cook's boats and several Nootkan canoes of various sizes are also drawn up on the beach. The extreme seaworthiness of the Nootkan canoe was demonstrated not only by the whal- ing ventures of die Nootkans but also by the early 20th century, round-the-world voyage of Captain Voss in his modi- fied Nootkan canoe, the Tilikum. Courtesy of the British Museum. summer. The shed-roofed, multiple family dwellings were built parallel to the beach in two or three rows which rose gradually one behind the other, the last row situated on the crest of the midden. The largest and most impressive houses in the village, 140 to 150 feet long, 24 to 30 feet wide and 7 to 8 feet high, were located closest to the beach. Those behind them and at the ends of the rows were smaller. After Cook's ships returned to England, news spread rapidly that the crews had made huge profits selling sea otter skins obtained in Nootka Sound. When reports and charts of Cook's voyage were pub- lished, the source of these precious furs became widely known and a steady stream of European and Ameri- can traders plied the waters of the Northwest Coast, trading for huge quantities of pelts sold later in Ma- 279</page><page sequence="5">Like impartial observers, two large carved and painted anthropomorphic forms watch a domestic scene in a plank house at Yuquot.

The impact of this trade was so great that reputedly it pulled Boston out of economic doldrums and made it one of the impor- tant trade centers of the world. Following Cook, many European traders came to Yuquot: James Hanna, 1785; James Strange, 1786, who left us an invaluable journal and word list which supplements the data gathered during Cook's visit; John Meares, 1788 who established a small factory in the village where he could house his men and trade and process furs. More importantly, the Spanish re- turned in 1789. Estevan José Martinez, Perez' pilot during the 1774 voyage, arrived at Yuquot to reassert through military power Spanish claims to this lucra- tive area. After several years of conflict between the English and Spanish, the convention for mutual abandonment of Yuquot was signed in Europe in • 1794. Spain permanently abandoned Yuquot, her northernmost settlement, in 1795 and the Northwest Coast became a free territory open to traders of all na- tions. The Moachat, led by Maquinna, returned to Yuquot and rebuilt their village. By this time the sea otter in the area had diminished to such an extent that Yuquot became little more than a place for traders to take on supplies of wood and water en route to more lucrative areas. An American ship, the Boston , was so employed near Yuquot in 1803, when it was boarded and seized by Maquinna and his men. All crew members were killed and beheaded except for John Rodgers Jewitt, a young armorer, and John Thompson, a sailmaker, who became Maquinna's slaves for approximately two and one half years. After Jewitt and Thompson were rescued in 1805, few shfps stopped at Yuquot and until the mid-nineteenth century the Moachat lived much as they did when first visited by Cook. The early European settlement on Vancouver Island began to make a permanent effect on the Nootkans in general. At first, large numbers of Nootkans succumbed to a series of diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (particularly the smallpox epidemic of 1852) to which Europeans were more resistant. Also, large quantities of firearms available from traders made feuds between village groups such deadly affairs that in some cases nearly whole villages were annihilated. 280</page><page sequence="6">General view of the modern village of Yuquot occupying the slope and crest of an ancient shell midden de- posited over 4,000 years on a gravel and sand spit The spit, rocky headland and islands form crescent-shaped Friendly Cove, which has sheltered the ships of many nations from the unpredictable weather of Nootka Sound for nearly 200 years.

Nootkans took part in the market economy, becom- ing major producers of dogfish oil lubricants for ma- chinery used in developing the lumber industry. They also sailed in sealing ships north to the Bering Sea where, if they escaped the dangers, their skills often earned them large sums of money. After 1895, when commercial salmon fishing expanded into Nootka Sound, many Moachat men became crew members on company fish boats while their wives and daughters worked in nearby canneries and reduction plants. Although Nootkans were willing to participate in a market economy, they were less willing to accept foreign values. In 1875 a mission was built near Yuquot at the village of Hesquiat. New teachings and laws began to undermine and contradict the old. Some Nootkan groups resisted with force, but ships of the Royal Navy at times compelled them to obey Euro- canadian laws. In 1889, Father A. J. Brabant built a church on the site of Meares* establishment at Yuquot. Nootkan culture began to change considerably. The Moachat adopted the dress and customs of their non-Indian neighbors. Houses at Yuquot increasingly resembled buildings in Victoria and Vancouver. The National Historic Sites Service of Canada be- gan archaeological excavations of the enormous mid- den at Yuquot in 1966. With a meticulously detailed technique of both vertical and horizontal control, a 281</page><page sequence="7">For an unknown length of time during the prehistoric period and at first contact with Europeans in 1774, the Nootkans uesd cutting tools of iron which is believed to have come from wrecks of oriental junks and trade with neighboring peoples. The Nootkans also used adze or gouge blades (a) pecked and ground from igneous stone. Primarily tools with these cutting blades, splitting wedges, and abraders of sandstone and sharkskin, were used to create a rich material culture in wood and bone. During the prehistoric and historic periods the Nootkans caught several species of fish with varieties of composite fish- hooks. One consisted of a ground stone shank with a grooved lower side and a lashing spur on the opposite side. A long, needle-like bone lashed firmly in the groove by wrapping nettle-fibre string around and above the spur completed the fishhook. The top of the shank was grooved for attachment of a leader. The hook represented by the large shank (c) may have been used in trolling for spring salmon and for taking cod. According to a respondent the bend in the other shank (d) would allow the com- plete hook to fit more easily inside a whole herring used as bait in trolling for salmon. The height of the shell blade (a) is 5.4 cm. Drawings by Ira Upin; photograph by Georges Lupien, National Historic Sites Service. Nearly all Nootkan fishing equipment consisted of wooden and fibre parts which decayed quickly in the rainy climate, and more resistant bone piercing components which remained to be found by the archaeologist. The late prehistoric and historic bone components shown here come from several dif- ferent kinds of hunting and fishing devices. The small wedge- shaped point (a) is probably the tip of a tripartite salmon harpoon head. The stemmed point (b) and multibarbed point (c) probably tipped arrows. The broken tip (d) may be from a thrusting spear. The two bone points (e) may have been part of a specialized double-pronged leister-harpoon for salmon. Different sizes of composite salmon harpoon heads are represented by unmatched barbs (f, ventral view and g, dorsal view) which had like mates that fitted together, form- ing sockets for a point at one end and the harpoon foreshaft at the other. Different varieties of gorges (h) were used to take fish and waterfowl. At least four kinds of composite fish- hooks with shanks of bone (k), stone, or wood, were used to catch several species of salmon, cod, and halibut. The straight point (i) was probably lashed to the U-shaped wooden shank of the halibut hook. The barbed point (j) is most likely also part of a composite fishhook. The large harpoon head (1) was probably for sealing. The length of the multibarbed point (c) is 11.9 cm. Photograph by Georges Lupien, Na- tional Historic Sites Service. YUQUOT continued 282</page><page sequence="8">The Moachat quickly acquired firearms which they used and traded to neighboring Nootkans and the Nimkish Kwakiutl. Standard 19th century hunt- ing gear and weapons were firearms represented here by the gunlock of a Northwest gun (a), two ramrod guides (g), probably for the Northwest gun, and gunflints (b). The complete 44-40 Do- minion cartridge (c) and .303 Canadian military issue cartridge shell (d) were used in rifles of the early 20th century. Modern fishhooks (f) and the occasional bent, wrought iron nail (e), possibly used as a fishhook, eventually replaced all com- posite hooks. Steel traps, like the post- 1930 mink size Oneida Victor trap (h), were important addi- tions to changing Moachat economic patterns. The fragment of iron stove (i) manufactured by Gur- ney Tilden, Hamilton, Ontario, post dates 1897 when large multi-family dwellings were ' being abandoned in favor of single-family units. The gunlock (a), courtesy of Professor Tomás Bartroli, is 15.1 cm. long. Photograph by Georges Lupien, National Historic Sites Service. section of the midden was excavated to a depth of eighteen feet, producing more than five thousand prehistoric and historic artifacts and approximately one hundred cubic feet of faunal remains. This culture collected from the Nootka Sound area from and ethnographic descriptions and objects of material material, combined with the wealth of ethnohistoric first European contact to the present, forms the basis for a multi-disciplined, integrated and functional analysis of the inhabitants of Yuquot from earliest known occupation to the present. Excavation began on the site of an historic plank house and the approximate site of the eighteenth-cen- tury Spanish troop quarters on the crest of the mid- den near the center of the present village. At the same time excavations began on San Miguel Island, the site of a Spanish gun battery. Here, we hoped to uncover remains of a small barrack, a field kitchen and gun emplacements, but, unfortunately, the Span- ish had dismantled these structures, and we found only a small quantity of eighteenth and nineteenth century artifacts. Although the historic period was generally well represented in the village by both indigenous and European artifacts, only a few fragments of a Spanish jar found near a burial, some sherds of other ceramics, and several nails mark the early period of European contact. This suggests (in agreement with ethnohis- toric accounts) that most goods obtained in trade with Europeans were exchanged with other Indians to pro- cure more furs and that indigenous subsistence pat- terns and technology did not change substantially until 283</page><page sequence="9">The relative quantity oř European artifacts from Yuquot and their periods of manufacture reflect enlargement and shrinkage of European contact. Artifacts from the early trading period are minimal, and the Spanish occupation from 1789 to 1795 left few identifiable remains, some of which are the mouth of an "olive jar" (d) and rim sherds of a bowl (e) and cup (f), both late 18th century Mex- ican Puebla Blue on White majolica. Almost no European artifacts can be attributed to the early and middle 19th century when few Europeans visited Yuquot and the Moa- chat lived much as they did in the 18th century. Most manufactured artifacts aate from the late 19th and the 20th centuries, when the Moachat experienced frequent contact with Eurocanadians and rapid cultural change. A carbonated drink bottle (i) manufactured by C. Morley, Victoria, and the base sherd of a post- 1870 Chinese liqueur or soy sauce bottle (h) suggest some of the many new tastes acquired then. Faceted blue trade beads (a and b), probably Venetian, were popular in the mid to late 19th century. A rarer 19th century bead at Yuquot was die Cornaline d'Allepo type (c). The body sherd of a com- mon yellow ware vessel with banded and mocha decora- tion (g) was one of the many types of ceramic wares used by the Moachat in the late 19th century. Height of bottle (i) without stopper is 17.8 cm. Photograph by Georges Lupien, National Historic Sites Service. YUQUOT continijed later. After 1875, however, when the Moachat became increasingly acculturated and virtually dependent on many Eurocanadian products, indigenous goods were rapidly replaced by manufactured items. Thus, in the upper levels, everything from hot water bottle stop- pers and baby feeding bottles to fragments of cast iron stoves, spent cartridges and steel traps were re- corded. Because objects of wood, skins, shells and plant fibers disintegrate quickly in the acidic soil and heavy rainfall, exact knowledge of such perishable aspects of Nootkan culture as the enormous cedar plank houses, colorful wooden masks and cedar bark regalia is lost for the precontact era. Therefore, nearly all the arti- facts recovered from the prehistoric strata at Yuquot are of bone or stone. Similar types of indigenous arti- facts found consistently throughout the midden and twenty-six carbon 14 dates suggest an unbroken occu- pation of more than four thousand years and little change in technology until extensive Eurocanadian contact in the late nineteenth century. Data recovered from the midden indicate that from the early days of human occupation, the inhabitants possessed a predominantly maritime-oriented culture with subsistence based primarily on fishing, mammal and bird hunting and shellfish collecting. Faunal re- mains and early European accounts of Moachat sub- sistence suggest that the prehistoric occupants of Yuquot relied on salmon, herring, cod and halibut as food sources. Seals, sea lions, porpoises and whales were also hunted and eaten. The bones of land mam- mals suggest that they were taken in lesser quantities for food and were also used as raw materials for tools and clothing. Numerous bird remains and arti- facts indicate that birds, mainly waterfowl, too were utilized for food and their bones for tools. Large amounts of mussel clam and chiton shells attest the importance of these shellfish in the Nootkan diet. Unfortunately, seaweed and various berries and roots eaten in historic times, and before European contact, have left no archaeological traces. Throughout the fine, charcoal-black midden we found the fishing gear components, harpoons, and projectile points with which the Nootkans caught their prey. The clever deadfalls, bird and fish nets, fish weirs and traps noted by the Europeans were also used prehistorically but, unfortunately, these devices have left no identifiable remains. Prehistoric clothing consisted of animal skins and cloth woven of cedar bark fibers which were some- 284</page><page sequence="10">This 42 foot high, vividly colored totem pole, carved around 1912, is topped by a Thunderbird.

Five years later Captain Jack presented the pole to Lord Willingdon, Governor General of Canada, who requested that it remain in Yuquot in memory of the first visit of a Governor General to Yuquot and to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Although the pole, now weather beaten and subject to dry rot still stands at Yuquot, the headdresses form part of the per- manent collection of the Museum of Anthropology of the University of British Columbia.

The white band toward the top of the excava- tion contains the re- mains of clams and mussels eaten within the historic period by residents of Yuquot. Older speckled remains of shell visible toward the bottom of the ex- cavation are not as ap- parent as those above because of deteriora- tion from water seep- age and the tremendous weight of the midden. Photograph by John Dewhirst; courtesy of the National Historic Sites Service. Ten teams of excavators trowelled their way through four millennia of refuse forming the midden. Each team, a recorder and usually one helper, excavated eight hours a day for two and one half months until the fossil beach bottom of the midden was reached. Other excavation personnel hoisted the buckets of midden mate- rial out of the pits and carried them to the screens for careful checking. The stadia rod leaning against the side of the trench was used with a level to determine the exact vertical pro- venience of artifacts, carbon and soil samples and features such as stone-rimmed fire pits.

Powers from super- natural beings were also deemed essential and were eagerly sought. The whaler, a chief for whom whaling was both a re- sponsibility and a prerogative, and his crew prepared for the hunt by fasting, sexual abstinence and rigorous purifica- tion marked by prayer and ceremonial bathing - all designed to bring help from supernatural beings. As part of this puri- fication the chief would enter fresh or salt water and scour his face and body with hemlock boughs until his blood ran freely. In the 1904 photograph of a family whal- ing shrine formerly located on an island in Jewitt Lake near Yuquot, a chief prayed for the procurement of dead whales. The shrine itself was a shelter which contained figures of humans. The human skulls placed on the ground formed a pallet for the whaler and his wife, and those perched on stakes were the "watch men" who guarded the shrine.

Although sev- eral varieties of bone needles were found, a single whalebone bark shredder and two bark beater frag- ments from the upper levels of the prehistoric strata are the only archaeological evidence that cedar bark was used before European contact. Prehistoric remains of adornment represented by several beads and pendants of bone, animal teeth and stone were found. In the historic period, blue glass trade beads became popular and gradually replaced items of indigenous manufacture. A rectangular and several circular stone- rimmed fire pits were recorded well within the prehistoric strata of the midden. These fire pits, some roughly aligned, may represent a series of cooking fires formed within. Unfortunately, no architectural remains were found at Yuquot, except for part of a well-preserved house- post and flooring of a recent house. The Moachat carved a variety of cedar dugout ca- noes in historic times, but no direct evidence for watercraft is available. However, watercraft of some kind was needed to maintain a maritime-based econ- omy and to reach Yuquot which is on an island. Moreover, the ground stone cutting tools distributed throughout the midden suggest a long tradition of woodworking of which wooden watercraft must have been a product. Watercraft would also make contact possible be- tween neighboring groups for trade and warfare, but the nature of contact between the prehistoric inhabit- ants of Yuquót and their neighbors is uncertain. Some trade with other peoples must have taken place be- cause the earliest European visitors report that trinkets and other materials traded to the Moachat soon disap- peared from the village to be replaced by more furs. Warfare and feuding, as activities of prehistoric life are suggested by a carved club or dagger han- dle and several large fragments of long, slender, sharpened whalebone points similar to those on short thrusting spears collected from Yuquot in historic times. Although over five hundred people lived in Yuquot during Cook's visit in 1778, only about one hundred of their descendants lived there during the excavation. The modern Nootkans not only emulated the friendli- ness of their ancestors, but also were skilled, interested and hard workers. Since the excavation, the popula- tion of the village has fallen off sharply due to the closing of the government day school, scarcity of work in the immediate area (the cannery and reduction plant were closed in the 1950s) and the tendency of young people to move to the city. Although many ex- residents return to Yuquot during the summer, today approximately only ten families live there on a yearly basis. Thus, the pressures of modern society are slowly turning what may be one of the oldest con- tinuously occupied villages in the Americas and once the chief port on the North Pacific into a memory.
