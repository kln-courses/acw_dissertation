<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SHI'-JEWISH "DEBATE" (MUNAZARA) IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY VERA B. MOREEN SWARTHMORE COLLEGE Surviving records of Jewish-Muslim polemical literature originate almost entirely from the Sunni mi- lieu. It is therefore difficult to establish whether polemical exchanges existed in the ShiCI world and how Shici arguments against Judaism may have differed from their Sunni counterparts. One record, albeit a "second-hand" one, recounted by some modern editors but based on earlier records, relates a mundzara ("debate") between the famous Shici divine, Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi b. Murtada Tabatabaci Burujirdi ("Bahr al-CUlim") and a few Jews in Dhu'l-Kifl (Iraq).' The encounter is said to have occurred in 1796 and the account sheds some light not only on the nature and extent of ShiCi-Jewish polemical exchanges but also on ShiCi-Jewish relations toward the end of the eighteenth century. This munazara may have been little more than a literary and educational exercise in promoting Bahr al-CUlum's erudition and the account we have of it shows clearly a predilection to rehash traditional Sunni arguments against Judaism. The voices of the Jewish interlocutors are muted and they present questions and answers that are difficult to believe. Nevertheless, there may be a kernel of historicity behind this rather unique account which makes it worthy of our attention. THE HISTORY OF POLEMICS between Jews and Muslims still has a number of unexplored corers even if the basic framework and arguments used by both sides were largely formulated as early as two centuries after the advent of Islam, and have been repeated, with little variation, ever since.2 However, because practically all the surviving 1 This text was brought to my attention by Professor Michel M.

A full account of the history of the Jews in Shi'i lands, particularly of the ancient Iranian Jewish community, is yet to be written. Although some of the later chapters of this history, particularly in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, are now better known,3 significant lacunae remain regarding most aspects of Jewish welfare since the establishment of the Safavid Shici state in 1501 and from the mid-eighteenth century until the present.4 There are many reasons that account for the difficulty of filling in these gaps,5 and yet only a full-scale investiga- tion would enable us to compare adequately the treat- ment of religious minorities in Shici as opposed to Sunni territories.6 Documents that deal directly with various aspects of Jewish-ShiCi relations are scarce; thus we are justified in exploring whatever evidence might help shed light on the subject. One such text, an account of a debate that is said to have taken place in Iraq toward the end of the eighteenth century (1796) between a famous Shici muj- tahid, commonly known by the honorific (laqab) Bahr al-'Ulim ("Ocean of the Sciences"), and the representa- tives of a small Jewish community, is the subject of this study. Referring to this particular debate in his article on "Muslim-Jewish Polemics" in The Encyclopedia of Reli- gion under the rubric "Decline of the Genre" [of polem- ics] and notes, Moshe Perlmann, without elaborating on the content, remarks that the Arabic account of the dis- putation shows it to have been "characterized by uncom- mon mildness and magnanimity."7 In order to arrive at a proper historical assessment, however, we need to con- sider the circumstances of the debate, the personalities involved, and the nature of the arguments employed by both sides. The accuracy of Perlmann's comment can only be determined through close scrutiny of the actual text of the debate, which, unfortunately, has not yet come to light.

(Tehran, 1956-60). 5 The information available is scant and much of it needs to be gleaned from Iranian royal chronicles, some of which have not yet been published in critical editions and most of which deal with very little outside the direct concerns of the court. Unless new manuscripts come to light, Judaeo-Persian texts, with the exception of the chronicles cited in n. 3, are mostly of literary nature, although some historical evidence can be gleaned from this material as well. 6 B. Lewis assesses very negatively the treatment of Jews in Shici Iran in his The Jews of Islam (Princeton, 1984), 40, 52, 82. I have tried to evaluate this assessment in light of Shici theolog- ical views in my "Salman-i Farisi and the Jews: An Anti-Shii'i Hadith from the Sixteenth Century?" in Irano-Judaica II, ed. Shaul Shaked and Amnon Netzer (Jerusalem, 1989), 144-57; and my "Risala-yi Sawa'iq al-yahid ['The Treatise Lightning Bolts against the Jews'] by Muhammad Baqir b. Muhammad Taqi al-Majlisi (d. 1699)," Die Welt des Islams 32 (1992): 177-95. The only account of this disputation that I have been able to find is recorded in the editors' introduction to Rijal al-Sayyid Bahr al-Uliim al-maCruf bi'l-Fawa'id al-rijaliyya ("The Biographies of Great Men, Known as 'Notes on Famous Men' of Bahr al-'Ulum"), written by the sayyid Muhammad Mahdi ibn Murtada Tabataba'i Burujirdi (1155-1212 A.H./A.D. 1742-97).8 The account given there and thus the text on which this study is based describes at some length (pp. 50-66) a munazara, a "de- bate," that occurred between Bahr al-cUlum and a group of Jews. According to the editors, the Sayyid took plea- sure in learned religious debates and had engaged in them previously several times with fellow Muslims during his seven-year stay in Mashhad (1772-79), and also in Mecca, during his three year hajj visit (1779-81). It was in Mash- had, in Khurasan, that he bested the philosopher Mirza Muhammad Mahdi al-Isfahani al-Khurasani, who then bestowed upon Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi the laqab "Bahr al-'Ulum" by which he came to be popularly known.9 The contents of these intra-Muslim debates are 7 The Encyclopedia of Religion, 11: 401. 8 Ed.

How- ever, perhaps because of the rarity of debates between Shicis and Jews, the same introduction presents a full account of the Sayyid's encounter with a group of Jews. Moreover, after the narrative of the debate itself, the ed- itors inform us that the exchange was famous enough to be noted by at least two other fairly recent Shici author- ities, namely Sayyid Mahmud Tabataba&gt;I, in al-Mawdhib al-saniyya ("The Sublime Gifts"),'1 and Sayyid Muham- mad Baqir al-Khwansari, in Rawdat al-janna fi ahwdl al-culamdD wa'l-sddat ("The Gardens of Paradise Regard- ing the Status of Learned Men and Sayyids").1 The former claims explicitly that many Jews converted as a result of this encounter. Both authors appear merely to be repeating a claim made by an earlier source, the Mun- tahd al-maqal ("The Conclusion of the Speech") by Shaykh Abu 'Ali Muhammad b. Ismaril al-Karbala'i (d. 1216 A.H. [1800-1801]), who was a student of Bahr al- cUlum. Shaykh Abu CAli's citation appears to be the ear- liest reference to the debate. He may have witnessed the event himself or had access to a contemporaneous account 1 "... Mahmud Tabataba3i in his book al-Mawahib al- saniyya, while mentioning the Sayyid Bahr al-'Ulum, said: 'As for his refutation of those who differ and are unbelievers in other regions and countries, it is too well known to be hidden. Due to his blessings, many who are too well known to mention have entered the religion of Islam. And today, among the peo- ple he set free, there are children whom we see among the pious of the time.' He [Mahmuid Tabataba'il also said: 'A large gath- ering of Jews confronted him in Dhu'l-Kifl, where two of their best people, cuzayr and Da'0ud, took it upon themselves to speak. The Sayyid [Bahr al-cUlum] asserted to them that which he transmitted to them of the books of the Torah, and he proved to them the occurrence of [textual] corruption in it until they ceased to talk. He wore himself out advising them until they finally acknowledged their weakness and sought a respite.... I heard from some of the learned men that one of the two later came to visit the Sayyid...." (Rijal al-sayyid, 65). 11 "Sayyid Muhammad Baqir stated in his book Rawdat al- janndt, while mentioning the Sayyid [Bahr al-'Ulum]: 'The de- tails of his disputation with a group of Jewish rabbis resulting, thanks to the blessedness of his soul, in the guidance of those ill-starred persons and in their submission to the truth and in acknowledging the prophecy of our praiseworthy prophet, is a clear business to which no obscurity or suppression is attached, and its confirmation does not lack proofs and witnesses until the clear, evident Resurrection ... "' (Rijal, 65-66). This state- ment is based on Muhammad Baqir al-Khwansari, Rawdat al- jannat fi ahwal al-'ulamd' wa'l-sadat (Qum, 1976), 7: 213. of it.'2 Several later sources, basing themselves on this report, repeat the claim.'3 The editors also maintain that the text of the debate itself has been carefully pre- served although they do not specify the manner of its recording, the name(s) of the transmitter(s), or its present location. They appear to imply that their account is based on a full text of the debate.14 In fact three sources refer explicitly to the existence of an original account. In the sentence following the quotation recorded in the Rijil, al- Khwinsari mentions that "the elucidation of this event is found in an orderly book among the collected works of the man mentioned above."'5 Mirza Muhammad CAli ("MuCallim Habibabadi"), in addition to referring to the conversion of some Jews in Dhu'l-Kifl (he is the only one among these sources to mention the location),l6 and bas- ing himself on al-Khwansari's claim, numbers the account of the debate (amplified by details provided by some un- named students of Bahr al-'Ulum who had witnessed it), as the eighth written work that can be attributed to the Sayyid.'7 Mirza Muhammad Tunuqabbuni also refers to a risala, or treatise, about "refuting (radd) the Jews."'8 Until this account actually surfaces, however (and, if it exists, it is probably still in manuscript), the editors' record of this encounter is the only one available to us. The Shici, or rather Muslim, bias of the account, which highlights Bahr al-CUlum's acumen and erudition, is readily apparent and what, if anything, in the account may be distorted or suppressed is, in the absence of other (especially Jewish) records of the event, a moot ques- tion. Despite the account's apparent grounding in fact, a number of its features cast doubt on whether the mund- zara actually took place in the manner related. Certain of its hortatory features suggest the possibility that the ker- nel of the actual event may have been subordinate to its aims, namely the extolling of Bahr al-'Ulum's educa- tional and proselytizing efforts. Furthermore, the vague identity of the Jewish protagonists suggests the possibility that the account, even in the form available to us, was 12 This work was not available to me, but the pertinent phrase is quoted in CAll Davani's Ustadh-i kull: Aqa Muhammad Baqir b.

But it would appear likely that the instruction derived from the mundzara was directed primarily at Shicis. THE DEBATERS AND THEIR TIMES The present account of the mundzara provides practi- cally no information about the identity of the Jewish par- ticipants in the debate, whose surnames are not given and who are referred to by the rather generic Jewish names of "Da'ud" and "CEzra" (CUzayr). If they were real indi- viduals, we may only guess that they were learned lead- ers of the local Jewish community.19 By contrast the Shici theologian, known to his contem- poraries and to future generations of learned Shicis sim- ply as "Bahr al-'Ul1m," was a major and prolific mujtahid of the usili branch of Shicism.20 His biography has been well preserved.21 In brief, he was born in Karbala in 1155/1742 where he studied under two famous theologians, Shaykh Yusuf al-Bahrani (d. 1186-1772) and Vahid Bihbihani (1118-1207/1706-92). He moved to Najaf in 1169/1755 and succeeded Bihbihani as a leading mujtahid upon the latter's death. Many miraculous stories are told about Bahr al-'Ulum, including the popular claim of communication with the Hidden (Twelfth) Imam.22 Bahr 19 See below, n. 63. As we have seen above, al-Khwansari (Rawdat al-janndt, 7: 213) does refer to them as ahbdr, "learned (non-Muslim) religious authorities," a claim not repeated by other sources. This claim can be assumed to be correct since the Sayyid is unlikely to have entered into such a discussion with or- dinary, unlearned Jews. 20 For succinct accounts of the usuli-akhbdri controversy in the eighteenth century, see Hamid Algar, Religion and State in Iran 1785-1906 (Berkeley, 1969), 33-35; Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shitism (New Haven, 1985), 117-18, 184-207, 222-25.

See especially Davani, Vahid Bihbihani, 224-32; and al-Tunukiabuni, Qisas (Tehran, n.d.), 171ff. al-cUlum, in turn, was the teacher of several famous students, such as Kashifu'l Ghita (d. 1812)23 and Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa&gt;i (d. 1826),24 to name only two, and he was the sire of a family that produced several famous Culamad up to the present. By the time of Bahr al-cUlum, the usili branch of Shi- Cism had come to prevail over the akhbdri in Iran and the Shici regions of Iraq.25 During most of his lifetime, Iran was under the rule of the Zand dynasty (1750-94); a change of dynasties occurred with the accession of the first Qajar Shah, Agha Muhammad (1794-97). Despite his family ties to Iran and to his ancestral town of Burfjird,26 Bahr al-CUlum was actually an Ottoman sub- ject. The two "thresholds" (Cataba), the shrines of Najaf and Karbala, were only briefly under Iranian protection during the reign of Shah cAbbas I (1571-1629) when he conquered Baghdad in 1624. They remained under his control until 1638, when Shah Safi I (1629-42) lost them again to the Ottomans.27 Nevertheless, Iranian threats to these parts of the Ottoman realm continued to make the Porte nervous.28 Despite Sunni dominion, the primarily Shi'C population of Najaf, Karbala, and their surroundings, retained strong ties with Iran. It is therefore not surprising to find a certain fluidity across these borders that neither the Ottomans nor the Iranians controlled too strictly. Thus students kept going back and forth to study with reputa- ble culamad and these, in turn, paid visits to their families on either side of the border. During Bahr al-'Ulum's lifetime approximately twelve Mamluk and Turkish pashas ruled Iraq (1750-1831). The welfare of Ottoman Jewry, already on the decline in the sixteenth century, continued to deteriorate in the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries.29 If the text before us is based on an actual event, and if this record of it is at least partially reliable, the apparent low level of erudition of the Jewish participants lends further support to the per- ception of the intellectual decline of Ottoman Jewry in 23 See a short biographical notice in Momen, An Introduc- tion, 315. 24 On the teachings of this shaykh, founder of the Shaykhi school of thought, see Momen, An Introduction, 225-31. 25 See the sources cited in n. 20, above. 26 Rijal al-sayyid, Iff. 27 Yitzhak Nakash, The ShiCis ofIraq (Princeton, 1994), 13-25. 28 Stanford J.

However, it is both unfair and ultimately impossible to gage the learning of these men from a debate in which, despite the veneer of friendli- ness, intimidation may have dominated, and from a sec- ond hand account issued by only one-the ShiCi-side of the debate. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEBATE The encounter between Bahr al-'Ulum and the Jews is supposed to have taken place in Dhu'l-Kifl (pronounced "Chefil" by the Persians, "Kifl" by the Arabs), a small town located about twenty miles south of Hilla, between Najaf and Karbala. This town derives its name from the Muslim name of the biblical prophet Ezekiel, whose tomb is supposed to be located there. Muslims usually identify the qur'anic "Dhu'l-Kifl" (Q 21:85; 38:48) with Ezekiel, and they, along with the Jews, venerate the prophet purportedly buried in the tomb.30 Dhu'l-Kifl was and continues to be a natural stopping place for Shici pil- grims traveling between Najaf and Karbala.31 Control of the tomb and its surroundings seems unclear between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries, although Jewish possession seems to have returned to some extent and the Jews continued to have access to the area. However, in 1765 the Danish traveler Carsten Niebuhr found the Muslims in charge of the shrine. It would appear that the Jews may not have regained full control of it until 1860, when the Muslims made an earnest but nonetheless un- successful attempt to wrest control once and for all.32 The existence and history of the shrine, attested to by numerous Jewish, Muslim, and European sources, is of 30 See I. Goldziher, The First Encyclopaedia of Islam (Leiden [1913-36], 1987), s.v. "Dhu'l Kifl"; EI2 (Leiden, 1971), 3: 535, s.v. "Hizkil"; Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1971), 6: 1096-97, s.v. "Ezekiel's Tomb"; Massac Bavel, ed. M. Benayahu (Jerusalem, 1955), 60. A detailed account of the various changes of authority between Jews and Muslims over the tomb is Zvi Yehudah's "Mabaqam shel yehude bavel Cal shelitah ha-qever Yehezkel ha-navi' be-Kifl be-'elef ha-sheni le-sefirah," Mehqarim he-toldot yehude 'lraq u-be-tarbutam 6, ed.

Unfortunately, our text does not shed light on either question. It is silent about who was in charge of the shrine although implying the existence of a large Jewish community-only some thirty years after Niebuhr passed through the area. Even if its claim of "three thousand Jewish souls"33 residing in Dhu'l-Kifl may be inflated for a small town (village?), perhaps in order to give the impression that the Sayyid engaged in debate with an important community, in the absence of accurate demographic information, we can assume, at most, that Dhu'l-Kifl was home to a fairly large number of Jews, perhaps even close to the number cited by the text, if all Jewish inhabitants, not only heads of families, were counted. If the shrine was wholly or even partially in Jewish hands, we may also assume that the livelihood of many of the Jews of Dhu'l-Kifl was either directly connected with its maintenance or with seeing to the needs of Jewish pilgrims.34 The account suggests that the debate took place at the initiative of the Jews, a dubious claim, since no disputa- tion between Jews and non-Jews ever took place, as far as we know, at the initiative of the former.35 Moreover, if the debate actually did take place, its ultimate aim appears to have been proselitizing.36 Given Bahr al-CUlum's pen- chant for religious debates, it is more likely that some Jews were urged, if not actually coerced, into participating in a dialogue with the Sayyid during his stopover in Dhu'l-Kifl. Interestingly, as it was often the case in many Christian tracts contra judaeos,37 the thrust of several of Bahr 33 See below, p. 578. 34 Unfortunately, John Gordon Lorimer's important Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia, 2 vols. (Calcutta, 1908-15), while attesting to widespread Jewish presence in Iraq in general (see, e.g., 2: 769, 770, and 792) does not shed light on their specific economic activities. 35 In addition to the sources cited in n. 2, see the following for the typology of Christian-Jewish debates in the Middle Ages: Frank Talmage, Disputation and Dialogue (New York, 1975); Amos Funkestein, "Basic Types of Christian Anti-Jewish Polem- ics in the Later Middle Ages," Viator 2 (1971): 373-82; Daniel J.

For the last years of Bahr al-'Ulum's life, when this incident is supposed to have occurred, it appears typical of highly respected Imami marjac al-taqlid ("source of em- ulation"), to engage publicly in such "teaching, the giving and receiving of ijdzat, leading worship, settling ques- tions of law and ritual, arbitrating disputes."39 THE ARGUMENTS OF THE DEBATE It is clear that this munazara is no "interfaith dialogue" as the concept is understood today. Although each side seems to know some aspects about the other's faith, Bahr al-'Ulum and his Jewish interlocutors are only margin- ally interested in each other's answers. The narrative of the account presents mostly the Sayyid's views. At times it seems as if the Jewish debaters are his "straw men." Bahr al-'Ulum's long arguments and the short, some- times apparently truncated answers of the Jewish partic- ipants, as well as the questions he directs toward his Jewish opponents, are obviously intended to display the erudition of the Sayyid, but we ought to question to what extent they do so at the expense, perhaps, of suppressing fuller, more learned answers, by his Jewish opponents. Even a cursory glance at Bahr al-'Ulum's arguments reveals that they are not original but that he was familiar with some of the older, traditional Muslim polemics against Judaism. Closer scrutiny uncovers his indebted- ness to the arguments of the Jewish apostate Samiauial al-Maghribi (d. ca. 1175), either directly, for we know that manuscripts of Ifhdm al-Yahud were widespread in the Muslim world,40 or indirectly, perhaps through the in- termediacy of someone such as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 1350).41 Both of these authors, and especially the first, were, in turn, indebted to the arguments of the Andalu- sian scholar Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), whose book on religious sects is one of the most significant texts on religion 38 See below, pp. 586 39 McChesney, "The Life," 168. 40 Samau'al al-Maghribi, Ifham al-yahud ("Silencing the Jews"), ed.

In fact, however, the scenario of the munazara may be simply a literary setting for Bahr al-'Ulum's display of what he knows of Jewish tradition. Since he, like earlier Muslim polemicists, was convinced that the Jews have tampered (tahrif) with the text of the Torah, and he accepted only the qur'anic version of biblical events,44 it would have served no purpose, and it may have been even dangerous, for his Jewish interlocutors (assuming they were real) to correct his erroneous (from the Jewish point of view) bib- lical references on the spot even if they had been able to do so-which also appears unlikely in this account. Or, if the Jews would have done so, it is unlikely that the ShiCi recorders of the event would have preserved these corrections, since they would have detracted from Bahr al-'Ulum's fame and erudition. Bahr al-'Ulum's arguments revolve essentially around four basic themes of Muslim-Jewish polemics: 1. the ab- sence of true monotheism among biblical Jews (pp. 578- 79); 2. anthropomorphism in the Torah (p. 583); 3. the charge that the Jews tampered with or corrupted the text of their Scripture (tahrif), including the related charges of abrogations (naskh) and innovations (bidac) (pp. 583- 86); 4. and the supremacy of Muhammad's prophecy over that of Moses (p. 588). Bahr al-'Ulum shows no sign of being acquainted with some of the traditional rabbinic answers to the problems he perceives in the Torah. In fact, 42 Ibn Hazm, al-Fisal wa'l-milal wa'l-ahwda wa'l-nihal wa hamishihi al-Milal wa'l-nihal li'l-Shahrastani, four volumes in two (Cairo, 1928).

See now also Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 138. 43 See below, p. 582. 44 It is interesting to note a couple of instances when Bahr al- CUlum implied that the qur'anic versions of the events he refers to are actually biblical; see below, p. 581. 575</page><page sequence="7">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) like Samaii'al al-Maghribi and Ibn Hazm before him, he finds the entire rabbinic tradition (Oral Law) reprehensi- ble. Some of his arguments were anticipated already by the Karaites and it is likely that Karaite objections are be- hind many of the polemical statements of Ibn Hazm and Samaudal al-Maghribi.45 Whatever Bahr al-'Ulum per- ceives as having been added to the Law of Moses (whose life and law he, like all Muslims, treats implicitly as a paradigm comparable to the life and sunna of Muham- mad), for example, the three daily prayers and pilgrim- age[s] (hajj) to Jerusalem belong, in his view, under the heading of bidca ("reprehensible innovation"), although he does not use this technical term.46 When he elaborates on aspects of naskh (p. 586), presumably in answer to a question posed by the Jews, Bahr al-'Ulum's explana- tions sound as if they were addressed only to the Muslims in his audience, who may well have held a range of defini- tions for that particular concept.47 Similarly, when he em- barks on persuading the Jews to abandon the "mindless" imitation of their forefathers (p. 586), he may be defining, for the benefit of his Muslim followers, rather than of the Jews, the proper meaning of taqlid ("imitation" or "blind acceptance of concepts") regarding the fundamentals of the faith (usiil al-din), which ought to consist of "each individual's independent investigation,"48 rather than of un- questioning following of others. This distinction was es- pecially important for the concept of marjac al-taqlid as developed by the usuli mujtahids.49 The participation of the Jews, as described in this ac- count, raises many other questions. The cumulative effect of their responses undermines the reliability of the ac- count itself, and, as a result, it resembles more a polemical tract than a live debate, even if the account was inspired originally by a historical occurrence. Some of the doubts raised by the Jewish response are: Is it believable, as stated earlier, that the Jews could not only have initiated the discussion but also put forth some six arguments, as the account claims? If the Jews were prominent and suppos- 45 Camilla Adang, "Elements karaites," 434-40. 46 This concept is, of course, an important battle ground in sharica, but not in Jewish halakhah. Rabbinic tradition is com- fortable in attributing most of the Oral Law (past, present, and future) to "the Law of Moses from Sinai" (BT, Berakot, 5a). See David Weiss Halivni, Revelation Restored: Divine Writ and Critical Responses (Boulder, Colo., 1997), 57-75. 47 John Wansbrough, Qur'anic Studies: Sources and Meth- ods of Scriptural Interpretation (Oxford, 1977), 197. 48 Momen, An Introduction, 175-76. 49 Ibid., 204; Ahmad Kazemi Moussavi, "The Establishment of MarjaCiyyat-i Taqlid in the Twelver Shi'c Community," Iranian Studies 18 (1985): 35-51. edly learned members of the Jewish community, how do we explain their complete silence when faced with im- portant accusations, such as the textual corruption of the Torah (pp. 582-83), or their confusion about the lack of prescribed prayer in Moses' time (pp. 583-84)? If their Jewish learning was so weak that they could not respond appropriately to these charges, is it more believable that they were familiar with the Qur'an to the point of being able to quote from it (pp. 585-86), show sufficient famil- iarity with it to maintain that it also fails to describe and prescribe Muslim prayer rituals (p. 584), and ask for a clarification of thorny theological issues, such as the differ- ence between naskh and insa3 (p. 586)? In what appears to be a truncated Jewish answer regarding the nature of the commandments (p. 585), there is a clue suggesting both that the debaters may have been more learned than the account allows, and that there may have been some tampering with it. Their "offensive" arguments, as in the case of adducing Deut. 18:15 (pp. 586-87),50 and in refer- ring to later revelations superseding earlier ones (p. 588), appear in fact to be expressing arguments generally used by Muslim polemicists.51 If we allow for a kernel of his- torical authenticity behind the account, Jacob Lassner's general elucidation of the problem may serve, in part, to explain the weak Jewish participation in this debate: Although a good deal has been written about polemics and a number of treatises have been preserved, the large picture of the Jewish response remains blurred. The ex- tant documents, few and far between, are marked by a narrow geographical distribution.... One thing appears likely, however. In dealing with Muslims, Jews would have been inclined to be circumspect. One could argue that, as a rule, Jewish responses to Muslim criticism, however shrill, were not a defense of the faith for the benefit of the hegemonic community, but more likely were intended for internal consumption. In any event, the frequent use of quotations in Hebrew and the writing of Arabic in Hebrew script must have deflected the impact of ideological counterthrust when and if non-Jews were inclined to take interest. Given these linguistic con- straints, few, other than Jewish converts, had the capacity to comprehend fully and thus explain thoroughly how Jews reacted to Muslim views. There is no indication that learned Muslim scholars acquired the skills to absorb Jewish texts in the original, nor is there evidence that the Jews were inclined to hang all their linen in public.52 50 Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 104 n. 92. 51 See below, n. 144. 52 Jacob Lassner, "The Covenant of the Prophets: Muslim Texts, Jewish Subtexts," AJS Review 15 (1990): 235-36. 576</page><page sequence="8">MOREEN: A ShlCi-Jewish "Debate" in the Eighteenth Century In the account before us the debate ends, not surpris- ingly, with Bahr al-'Ulum's verbal victory and his dissat- isfaction at not having been challenged more seriously. Interestingly, if some Jews, or even the debaters them- selves actually converted after the event, as some of the sources claim,53 one would have expected the account to state this explicitly, which it does not. Bahr al-cUlum's proselytizing goals (pp. 586-87) may have encountered serious opposition, for the account ends simply with an invitation to the Jews to return in a year. Unfortunately, neither here nor in the sources that claim that Bahr al- CUlum converted some Jews, are we told when exactly those conversions occurred and what actually happened after one year-that is, whether this time period was merely a face-saving device for both sides, or whether it was in the nature of a threatening deadline. An interesting feature of this munazara is the complete absence in it of any polemical arguments that could be construed as specifically ShiCi rather than Sunni in char- acter. Puzzling at first, upon contemplation, this absence is not really that surprising. If Bahr al-'Ulum was unable to make his Jewish interlocutors accept the veracity of Muhammad's mission and message, how could he move beyond this basic issue and ask them to accept the au- thority and testimonies of the twelve imams? In other words, converting the Jews to the Shic branch of Islam, step two, required a first step, acceptance of the funda- mentals of Islam, which the Jews clearly did not take in this debate. If, on the other hand, the account is more literary than factual, it clearly demonstrates Bahr al- CUlum's reliance on earlier Sunni polemical tracts in an area, arguing against ahl al-kitab, where Shicis and Sun- nis had few if any differences. It is reasonable to assume that the thrust of Shici polemical energies were devoted not to arguing against Jews but to engage the various Sunni schools, as reference to Bahr al-'Ulum's own de- bates in Mecca intimate.54 If, as I am inclined to believe, there is at least a kernel of historicity behind this account, it does shed some light on the nature of ShiCi-Jewish coexistence in Iraq toward the end of the eighteenth century. The tone of the debate, though not as mild or as magnanimous as Perlmann's as- sertion would have us believe, does not allow for broad generalizations beyond the obvious, namely, that the re- lationship between Jews and Shicis at this time and in this particular place were fairly cordial, and that behind this cordiality there nevertheless lay a thinly concealed Shici effort to convert the Jews. Judging by this account the Jews, on the whole, appear to have resisted the pros- elytizing effort even if they probably lost some individ- ual members in the fray. Thus, regarding the broader issue of whether there were more numerous persecutions of Jews in Shici than in Sunni lands,55 this mundzara lends support to the impression substantiated by Judeo- Persian chronicles,56 namely that the Jews (and all reli- gious minorities) in Shici realms felt increasing pres- sures commensurate with the consolidation and growth in power of the ShiCi hierocracy.57 A TRANSLATION OF THE EXISTING ACCOUNT OF THE DEBATE "His debate with the Jews" In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, who sent Muham- mad, master of messengers, as a seal for all His prophets, with the clearest proof and strongest evidence.

May God, the exalted, please the world with his exist- ence, and may He, by the perpetuity of his good fortune, raise the banners of good fortune. May he continue, like his name [Mahdi], to be a guide, and may God make him endure until he meets his namesake [i.e., the Mahdi] from among the imams. And this [occurred] when he traveled from the won- drous mashhad58 (i.e., Najaf), to visit his ancestor Husayn [in Karbala], in the holy month of Dhu'l-hijja, in the 121 1th year after the prophetic emigration [1796 C.E.], may thou- sands of greetings and salutations be upon him [Muham- mad] who guards it. There was with him on that day a large group of accomplished disciples. Their path tra- versed the site of Dhu'l-Kifl, in which in those days there lived a group of Jews numbering about three thousand souls.59 The news of his arrival reached them [the Jews]; they had already heard about the brilliance of his high rank and nobility. Among them there were those who claimed to know and thought that they had evidence and proof for what they believed. A group of their learned men caught up with the noble one. They followed him in order to have a debate (munazara), until they reached the Rabat [quar- ter] that he [Bahr al-cUlum] commanded should be built for pilgrims and visitors.60 They alighted there in his ma- jestic presence and sat down in front of him politely, to his right and on his left. They were like bats in the sun who have no other abode than in utter darkness.61 Then he welcomed them as was his habit and pleasant disposition. He addressed them softly lest one of them [not] take note or become fright- 58 Mashhad al-gharwah, "the wondrous place of martyrdom," is one of the epithets ascribed to Najaf, the site of a tomb believed to be the burial place of CAll b. Abi Talib. 59 See my comments above, p. 574. 60 This refers to a specific part of the town which derives its name from the fact that it contained hospices and inns. Its being built at Bahr al-'Ulum's initiative confirms his important social standing in Najaf, especially during his second sojourn there ( 1196-1212/1782-1797), when he became marjac al-taqlid, after the death of Muhammad Baqir Bihbihani (d. ca. 1792) (Mc- Chesney, "The Life," 168-69). 61 This "editorial comment" reflects the ShiCi view of the en- counter in which the "unenlightened" Jews were about to re- ceive light, i.e., correct information regarding their own religion [!] and Islam. ened.62 Among them there were two men who claimed to have knowledge, one was Da'ud and the other cEzra.63 Da'id began to speak, saying: "We and the community of Islam, from among all other religious communities, are monotheists and are free of polytheism. The rest of the groups and peoples, such as the Zoroastrians and the Christians, associate partners with their lord and worship idols and graven images. No others remain to profess God's unity (tawhid), except the two groups [Jews and Muslims]."64 Then the Sayyid said: "How is this? The Jews adopted the [Golden] Calf and worshiped it, 'and they did not cease to cling to it until Moses returned to them' from the appointed meeting with his Lord.65 This affair of theirs is too famous to need recalling and too well known 62 The statement implies that the Jews' presence at the debate was not, perhaps, as voluntary as was stated a few lines earlier. 63 The full name, rank, and standing of these Jewish oppo- nents is not specified beyond their being called Culamda al- yahud, "learned men of the Jews" (Rijdl al-sayyid, 43 and 50). Their vague identities-they bear "archetypal" (from the Mus- lim point of view) Jewish names-may indicate either the con- temptuous attitude of the Shici recorders of the event, or it may be additional evidence for considering the encounter as largely fictitious. 64 The accuracy of the recording of the discussion's opening is suspect. There was probably a polite exchange of niceties, as we are told that the Sayyid welcomed the Jews kindly. But that the Jews would venture to initiate the conversation unprompted, by referring to the importance of the concept of tawhid ("declaring or acknowledging God's Oneness") in both Judaism and Islam, appears unlikely. 65 The editors have placed the qur'anic verse in quotation marks but they have not quoted the verse exactly, having changed it from the first person plural to the third person plural: "They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return unto us" (Q 20:91). (This and all subsequent quo- tations from the Qur'an are from M. M. Pickthall's translation, The Meaning of the Glorious Koran [New York, n.d.].) The Qur'an refers several times to the Golden Calf incident: Suras 2:51, 2:92, 4:153, 7:147, and most qur'anic commentators dis- cuss it at length. Two of the most famous accounts occur in al- Tabari's (d. 923) Ta'rikh al-rusul wa'l muluk [Annales, ed. M. J. de Goeje (Leiden, 1879-81)], 1: 489ff., now in the translation of William M.

Then they also worshiped idols in the time of Jeroboam b. Nabat, who was one of the servants of Solo- man b. David.66 His story is as follows: Soloman detected in him the desire to rule and perceived in him marks of leadership and sovereignty. Ahijah of Shiloh had informed Jeroboam of [Soloman's suspicion] and he [Ahijah] tore the new garment he [Jeroboam] wore, ripping it into twelve pieces giving him ten, saying: 'You will reign over this many [i.e. ten] tribes of the children of Israel, and there will remain for Soloman and his son Rehoboam and his sons only two tribes, namely Judah and Benjamin.'67 Then Soloman planned to kill Jeroboam, but Yeraboam b. Nabat fled from Soloman to Shishak, the ruler of Egypt, and remained with him until Soloman died. He then re- turned to al-Sham. It was his [Jeroboam's] view and the view of all the children of Israel that Rehoboam, the son of Soloman, should be made king, and they made him king. Then they [the children of Israel] came to him imploring his mercy on account of the burdens and difficulties that were imposed upon them in the days of Solomon. But Rehoboam said to them: 'Verily, my little finger is stronger than my father's little finger.68 If, indeed, my father had imposed on you difficult tasks and made you bear troublesome bur- dens, I will place and impose upon you that which is [even] more burdensome and more difficult.' Then they [the children of Israel] separated themselves from him and ap-pointed Jeroboam b. Nabat and made him king over themselves; ten tribes of Israel were in agreement about him. And Rehoboam b. Soloman became ruler of the two [remaining] tribes in Jerusalem.69 But, because the chil- dren of Israel used to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem every 66 The account that follows is based on 1 Kings, 11-12. It is not a story with which Muslim historians and polemicists were par- ticularly familiar, and it may have reached Bahr al-'Ulum through a Jewish informant. Al-Tabari refers very briefly to Rehoboam's reign (Ta'rtkh, 2: 619), as does Ibn Hazm (al-Fisal, 1: 143-44); neither refers to the conflict recorded in the biblical account. 67 Bahr al-'Ulum shows here some awareness of the tradi- tional Jewish interpretation of 1 Kings 11:32 and 11:36: "But one tribe [not two!] shall remain his-for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem...." (This and all biblical quotations are from Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures [Philadelphia, 1985]). In his popular biblical commentary Rabbi David Qimhi (Radaq; d. ca. 1235), states the traditional rabbinic view con- cerning this verse: "[The tribes of] Judah and Benjamin were considered one tribe because they were joined in [their] inherit- ance and in Jerusalem" (Mikra'ot Gedolot: Melakim [New York, n.d.], 1280). See also Josh. 15:20ff. and 18:11ff. 68 An abbreviated paraphrase of 1 Kings 12:10. See also 1 Kings 12:14. 69 1 Kings 12:21. year, Jeroboam feared for his reign if he should permit them to [continue to] go to pilgrimage on account of Re- hoboam and his followers, who might turn them [the chil- dren of Israel] away from him [Jeroboam], or cause them to become favorably inclined toward him [Rehoboam]. Therefore he made for them two golden calves and placed them in Dan and Bethel, saying: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who made you go up from the land of Egypt.'70 And he commanded the people to worship them and to go on pilgrimage to them. They obeyed and thus became idol- aters once again, after the worship of the [first Golden] Calf.71 So how can any of you Jews say that the Jews did not use to associate others with God, the exalted, and had no other god beside God, the exalted, and that they were monotheists, turning away from anything other than God?" They [the Jews] acknowledged what he had said about their worship of idols in accord with what he had men- tioned and wondered at his having noticed what no one else knew of their own affairs.72 Then he said to them: 70 1 Kings 12:28. 71 Muslim familiarity with this act of Jeroboam may go back to the account of the Karaite scholar Abu Yiisuf al-Qirqisani (fl. tenth century). He discusses the incident in the section on the "History of Jewish Sects" of his code of law, Kitab al-anwar wall maraqib, ed. Leon Nemoy (New York, 1939-43), 2: 6-10; Nemoy translates the incident in his "Al-Qirqisani's Account of the Jewish Sects and Christianity" HUCA 7 (1930): 317-97. Nemoy provides a more polished translation of the same passages in his Karaite Anthology: Excerpts from the Early Literature (New Haven, [1952] 1980): 45-49. See now also the translation of Wilfrid Lockwood, in YaCqub al-Qirqisani on Jewish Sects and Christianity (Frankfurt an-Main, 1984), 95-100. Al-Qirqisani's close reading of the biblical narrative convinced him to regard Jeroboam's act not as idolatry, for "... Jeroboam did not deny the Glorious Creator nor abrogate Him, nor did he worship idols, as some people imagine ...." (Nemoy, "Al-Qirqisani's Account," 323), but simply as a political move intended to "wean" his peo- ple from going to Jerusalem, where they could have been en- ticed to return their allegiance to the House of David. In fact, according to some Jewish legends, Jeroboam was the prophet Ahijah's closest disciple and attained great spiritual heights be- fore he succumbed to the corruption of power (see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews [Philadelphia (1913) 1968], 4: 180 and 6: 305 nn. 6 and 7 and the sources cited there). However, for clearly polemical reasons, already Samaudi&gt;l al-Maghribi cites the charge of Jeroboam's idolatry, stripped of other motivations (Ifham al-yahid, 37-38, 55, 88; English tr., 48-49, 57, 72). 72 If the account before us can be believed, it may not be surprising that the Sayyid's Jewish interlocutors do not mention al-Qirqisani's explanation, with which they may not have been 579</page><page sequence="11">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) "How was it permitted to Soloman to plan to kill Jeroboam before [he committed] his crime?73 This is not permitted in the law (sharla) of Moses, nor in the law of the other prophets. Solomon adhered to the law of Moses, and if he was permitted to do that which Moses was not per- mitted, [then] abrogation [of the law] is permitted; but you deny [the possibility of] abrogation."74 They [the Jews] were silent. Da'ud, their leader, said: "0, our mas- ter, we accept your words wholeheartedly." Then he [the Sayyid] asked: "Tell me, are there among you, O com- munity of Jews, differences [of opinion], and are there contradictions and disagreements in your books?" They answered: "No." But he said to them: "How can this be? You are divided into three sects from which seventy-one sects have split off.75 [One of these] is the Samaritans, a familiar. Nevertheless, it is surprising that they do not point out the political motivation of Jeroboam's action, which is clearly brought out even in the Sayyid's account. 73 The Sayyid is probably alluding to Solomon's prophetic powers for, after the prophet Ahijah announced to Jeroboam that he will wrest most of the kingdom from the heirs of So- lomon (1 Kings 11:30ff.), the biblical account does not reveal how this information reached Solomon. See Ginzberg, Leg- ends, 6: 301, n. 93 and the sources cited there, and al-Tabari, Ta'rikh (Annales) 2: 572; Brinner, tr., Chidren of Israel, 152. 74 The issue of naskh ("abrogation"), to which Bahr al-cUlum refers several times directly or indirectly, is, of course, one of the thorny knots of Muslim theology, which Muslims took great pains to attribute to other traditions besides their own. The con- cept is based primarily on Sura 2: 106. For perceptive comments on some of the differences between the Jewish and Muslim views of this concept, see John Wansbrough, Qur'anic Studies, 192-202; idem, The Sectarian Milieu: Content and Composition of lslamic Salvation History (Oxford, 1978), 109-12, 150-54. For a succinct account of the role of naskh in Muslim-Jewish polemics, see Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 35-41, 69, and the sources cited there. 75 Al-Qirqisani lists at least fifteen sects, spread out in time, among the Jews (Nemoy, Karaite Anthology, 49-53). Ibn Hazm mentions the Rabbanites, Karaites (CAnaniyya), 'Isawiyya, Samar- itans, and the Sadducees (Saduqiyya) (Kitab al-fisal, 1: 93ff., and Al-usul wa'l-furui ed. Muhammad 'Atif al-CIrfqi [Cairo, 1978], 1: 196). I am grateful for these references to Dr. Camilla Adang, who also drew my attention to the clearer mention of the Karaites in Ibn Hazm's Al-usul than in his Kitab al-fisal. Al-Shahrastani (d. 1153) contrasts the views of Rabbanites and Karaites in the context of discussing anthropomorphism among Muslim sects, see Muslim Sects and Divisions: The Section on Muslim Sects in Kitab al-Milal wa'l Nihal, tr. A. K. Kazi and J. G. Flynn (London, 1984), 78, 88-92. For a comprehensive discussion of Muslim views on large sect of the Jews that differs from them in many things. The Torah that they have differs from that which the rest of the Jews have." They answered: "We do not know why these differences occurred. But we do know that the Book of the Samaritans differs from ours and that they also differ from us in many other matters."76 Next he said to them: "How do you deny disagreement [among you] and claim agreement on one [and the same] thing?" He also asked them: "Has anything been added to or taken away from the Torah which God, the exalted, revealed to Moses?"77 They answered: "It is as it has been until now; nothing was added, nothing was taken away?"78 He replied: "How can this be? For in the Torah which you have there are things that are clearly abominable, ugly and repulsive,79 such as what happened in the story of the [Golden] Calf to the prophet Aaron, which attri- butes to him the making of a god for the children of Israel. This is the translation of the phrase in the Torah in the chapter 'The Revelation of the Tablets and the Making of the Calf,' which is chapter twenty of the second Jewish sects, see Wasserstrom, "Species of Misbelief," and now, Between Muslim and Jew, 64ff. The concept of seventy-one or seventy-two nations and lan- guages to which the notion of over seventy sects can be traced is of ancient origin and is found in many early Jewish and non-Jewish sources (e.g., Ginzberg, Legends, 1: 173; 5: 194-95 n. 72; 6: 375 n. 104). Therefore it is not surprising to find it surfacing in early hadiths (see A. J. Wensinck, Concordance et indices de la tradition musulmane [Leiden, 1936-71], 135, under firqatun/firaq). 76 Neither the Sayyid nor the Jews appear to be well informed about the Samaritans; thus they spend little time on the subject. 77 Without using the technical terms in which this Muslim accusation is usually leveled against the Jews, Bahr al-'Ulum is nevertheless referring either to some form of tabdil (deliberate falsification of scripture), or tahrif (forgery). Various early Mus- lim scholars understood different processes by these terms; see Jean-Marie Gaudeul and Robert Caspar, "Textes de la tradition musulmane concernant le tahrif (falsification) des ecritures," Is- lamochristiana 6 (1980): 61-104; Wansbrough, Quranic Studies, 189-90, 196; idem., The Sectarian Milieu, 109; Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, index under these two terms; Wasserstrom, Between Muslim and Jew, 174-75. There may well be a Karaite undertone to this argument; see Nemoy, Karaite Anthology, 249. 78 The Jewish answer, and maybe Bahr al-'Ulum's question as well, echo Deut. 13:1. 79 Ibn Hazm (Kitab al-fisal, 1: 105ff.), and Samau'al al-Magh- ribi (Ifham al-yahud, 59ff.; English tr., 58ff.), were particularly offended by stories imputing shocking or immoral action to bib- lical prophets.

Perlmann, "Eleventh-Century Andalusian Authors on the Jews of Granada," PAAJR 18 (1949): 274ff. 580</page><page sequence="12">MOREEN: A ShiCi-Jewish "Debate" in the Eighteenth Century book:80 'When the people saw that Moses was late in de- scending from the mountain, they turned to Aaron and said: "Rise and make us gods who will march before us, for this man Moses, who brought us out from the land of Egypt, we don't know what happened to him."8l And Aaron said to them: "Take off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives, sons, and daughters, and bring them to me."82 The people did so. They removed the golden earrings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron, and he took these from them and molded them into a form, and shaped it into a molten calf, and they adopted it as a god and worshiped it. Then, when Moses came from his meeting with his God and saw what Aaron and his people had done, he disapproved of it and re- buked Aaron, while the latter apologized to him saying: "Do not blame me for this; I would not have done it ex- cept for fear of division among the children of Israel."'83 80 There is, of course, no such title associated with Exod. 20, which is, in any case, not the correct reference for the story that the Sayyid mentions, namely, Aaron's fashioning of the Golden calf (Exod. 32). Bahr al-'Ulum's biblical references are off in the entire debate, which raises the important question of who or what his Jewish sources were. Despite the availability of some partial and not very well disseminated copies of Arabic trans- lations of the Pentateuch, scholarly opinion generally favors the idea that the main channel of biblical information available to Muslim scholars was oral, in the form of consultation with local Jewish informants. (See Lazarus-Yafeh, "Muslim Authors and the Problematics of Arabic Translation of the Bible," ch. 5 of Interwined Worlds; and David S. Powers, "Reading/Mis- reading One Another's Scriptures: Ibn Hazm's Refutation of Ibn Nagrella al-Yahudi," in Studies in Islamic and Judaic Tradi- tions, ed. William M. Brinner and Stephen D. Ricks [Atlanta, 1986], 120 n. 17). The fact that the Jews do not correct the Sayyid may be attributed as much to their sense of intimidation, and the high probability that they never saw this Arabic ac- count of the debate, as to the likelihood that they themselves would have been familiar only with references to the parasha (weekly divisions) of the Torah rather than with chapter numbers and certainly not with titles, which do not exist in the Torah. 81 Exod. 32:1. 82 Exod. 32:2. 83 Aaron's reply is not found in the biblical account, nor did I find any intimation of it among Jewish commentators and mi- drashim. But the Qur'an refers to this incident on two occasions, Suras 7:142ff., and 20:77ff. Bahr al-cUlum relates here Aaron's reply as recorded in Sura 20:94. In Islamic tradition Aaron's responsibility is diluted by the involvement of a man called al-Samiri. Aaron had asked for the jewels to be thrown into a pit because they were Egyptian spoils forbidden to the Jews, but "This is irrefutable proof that the Torah you have is cor- rupt,84 and that it contains additions to the Torah that was revealed to Moses, for this kind of behavior could not originate even from a foolish ignoramus; how then could it originate from the like of the prophet Aaron? And how could he have made such an apology to Moses? The di- vision of the children of Israel, in his [Aaron's] estimation, would have been a smaller offense than Aaron's fashion- ing a god for them to worship? How could he fear the dis- sension among the children of Israel and not worry that they commit polytheism and idolatry? Moses had said to him: 'O Aaron, take my place among the people. Do right, and follow not the way of mischief-makers."'85 Then Da'id and the Jews who were with him, said: "And what objection is there to this? Gabriel has also as- sisted [them] in this, and the story concerning him is as famous in the Torah as the story of Aaron."86 But he an- swered: "Gabriel did not assist in this matter, and there is nothing in the Torah of that which is here. It was al- Samiri who found a trace of animation in the footprints of Gabriel's horse and seduced the people by this means.87 Gabriel bears no responsibility in this matter, nor does God, the sublime, the exalted, since He created the cir- cumstance that led to the sedition, just as He created cir- cumstances of adultery, murder, and other sins. They do not happen except in [specific] circumstances and [are carried out by] specific instruments. But this does not come under the rubric of assistance to idolatry and trans- gression [of God's commands]; God is exalted greatly above [all] this.88 al-Samiri caused these materials to turn into "a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing sound" (Suras 20:88; 7:148). When the angel Gabriel came to take Moses on horseback up to Mt. Sinai, al-Samiri caught a handful of dust from its hoofprint turning the jewels into a calf (al-Tabari, Ta'rikh (Annales), 1: 492ff.; Brinner, tr., The Children of Israel, 72-76; al-MasCidi, Prairies d'or, 2: 388ff. 84 Here Bahr al-'Ulim uses the technical term muharrafa[tun], "corrupted (word)," and seems to base his argument on the purely Muslim assumption that prophets do not commit reprehensible ac- tions. See above, n. 77. 85 The Sayyid does not make it clear whether he is about to quote the Torah or the Qur'an. Here he cites from Sura 7:142. 86 The Jews appear to show some awareness of the qur'anic version of the biblical events. See above, n. 44. 87 See above, n. 44. 88 Bahr al-cUlim's views here on God's omnipotence and the limitations of human freedom go as far back as al-AshCari (d. 935) (W. Montgomery Watt, Free Will and Predestination in Early Islam [London, 1948], 141-47). 581</page><page sequence="13">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) "And in the fourth chapter of the fifth book mentioning the [Golden] Calf and the reprimand of the children of Israel regarding its worship, it is stated: 'God was very angry with Aaron and almost destroyed him, but I begged [God's] pardon on his behalf. He forgave him this as well.'89 This clearly shows the repulsiveness of this act and its odiousness, for if God was angry with Aaron on its ac- count, how can you say that there was no objection to it? "Almost as bad as this story in repulsiveness and odi- ousness is what is recounted in the Torah about the story of Lot and his two daughters.90 In chapter twenty-three of the first book of the Torah9l [there is the following verse]: 'Verily, when Lot went up from Swghr92 and dwelled in the mountain with his two daughters (his people having been destroyed), the older of the two said to the younger one: "Our father is an old man and there are no men [left] on earth to cohabit with us, as is the way of mankind. Rise, let us give our father wine to drink and have sexual intercourse with him, and let us strive to be- get progeny from him." So they gave him wine to drink that night and the older one came and had intercourse with her father and he did not perceive her sleeping [with him] nor her rising. Then, on the next day, the older one said to the younger one: "I had intercourse last night with father. Rise, let us give him wine to drink tonight and have intercourse with him yourself." So they gave him wine to drink that night as well. The younger one arose and had intercourse with him and he did not perceive her sleeping or waking. Thus Lot's two daughters became pregnant by their father. The older one bore a son and she called him Moab. He is the progenitor of the "children of Moab" to this day. And the younger one bore a son and she called him Amon. And he is the progenitor of the "children of Amon" to this day.' "This is the text of the Torah which the Jews93 have; I 89 The correct reference is probably to Deut. 9:20, and Bahr al-cUlum's "translation" is off. 90 Lot (Lut), Abraham's nephew, is regarded as a prophet in Islamic tradition, cf. al-Tabari, Ta'rikh (Annales 1: 325ff.; Brinner, tr., Prophets and Patriarchs [Albany, 1987], 11 ff.), hence the account of his engendering offspring with his daughters was con- sidered extremely repulsive by Muslim polemicists. See Lazarus- Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 32-33, and the sources cited there. 91 The reference is erroneous again. The incident with Lot and his daughters occurs in Gen. 19:30-38. 92 Zoar; Gen. 19:30. 93 Dr. Camilla Adang drew my attention to the change here and in the next paragraph from the direct address in the second person plural used thus far to the third person plural. It may be an editorial "slip," or it may well lend support to the idea that the munazara format is not the record of an actual event but is merely a literary foil. have translated it [these passages] word-for-word.94 But this is an evident lie and an ugly slander. Reason rejects that such shameful and slanderous incidents could occur to the messengers and prophets of God, and that their daughters and sons could be afflicted with the conse- quences of such odious behavior throughout time and for all generations [to come].95 "As for Moab and Amon, they are two great nations between al-Balqa' and Mt. al-Shara.96 The grandmother of Soloman and David was from among the children of Moab,97 so according to the Jews this entire progeny is ignoble, since it was not engendered through lawful mat- rimony. The daughters' being prohibited to the father is agreed upon by all laws and religions. Sisters too were prohibited by previous religions. That is why Abraham, when the Egyptians asked him about Sarah, said: 'She is my sister,'98 so that they would not think that she was his wife and would [not] kill him. And there is no doubt that, in being prohibited, a daughter has precedence over a sister.99 It is usually not probable for one advanced in age to impregnate on two successive nights, especially while excessively drunk, which is what they claim. However, it was said that Lot, after the affair with Sodom, was nearing one hundred years [of age].?00 "How could Lot's daughters think that the world was de- void of men, despite knowing that those who perished were exclusively the people of Lot? They knew that Abra- ham and his people were in the village of Jiruinll and be- tween him and them there was only [a distance] of one parasang, that the calamity did not befall them, and that the entire world, except the people of Lot, were safe from it. "Therefore this is a lie mixed with excessive stupidity. It would have been enough for them to know that their father would realize this repulsive act when he awoke, and so would Abraham, the uncle of their father, on ac- count of the great position and close relationship [to Lot]. This should have sufficed to prevent them from perpe- 94 As the loose accuracy of the Sayyid's references shows, this claim cannot be taken literally.

It, and the like of it which occurs in your Torah, O community of Jews, is proof of the occurrence in it of corruption and addition.102 "And if we wished to elaborate on the contradictions and the differences that occur in this Torah, and on what it unsuitably associates with the Creator, the great and mighty, such as corporeality, form, remorse, sorrow, weakness, [and] weariness, words would be drawn out in- deed and this place would not be wide enough [to contain them all].103 "But tell me, O community of Jews, can ritual prayer (salat) be missing in any religious law (sharfa)?" They answered: "No; ritual prayer is prescribed in all of them and no religious law is devoid of it." He said: "Inform me about this ritual prayer of yours. What is its origin? And whence is it taken? This Torah, which is made up of five books, we have examined and know what is in it book by book, but we have not found ritual prayer in any of them by name or mention."04 Then one of them replied: "The fact that it [ritual prayer] is commanded is known through implication rather than through explicit words.105 The To- rah contains [commands] regarding the invocation (dhikr) 102 ... al-tahrif wa'l ziydda (Rijal al-sayyid, 57). 103 Although they are not elaborated upon in this munazara, accusations of wild anthropomorphism rank at the top of anti- Jewish (and anti-Christian) Muslim polemical arguments: see Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 29-31, 136-37. It is inter- esting to note that Ibn Hazm appears to have heard of Shiur Qomah, the Jewish anthropomorphic text associated with the Merkavah mystical tradition, which gives the "measurements" of God (ibid., 31, 136). He seems to have borrowed this and many of his other ideas critical of (Rabbanite) Judaism from Karaite sources, especially from al-Qirqisani's Kitab al-anwdr, 1: 3.2; 1: 4.1). For a detailed analysis of Ibn Hazm's indebtedness to Karaite sources, see Camilla Adang, "Elements karaites." 104 Like the Karaites, Bahr al-cUlum appears to be implying that Jewish prayers in their entirety should come from the bib- lical text as, for example, Surat al-Fatiha, comes from the Qur'an. See Daniel Frank, "The Shoshanim of Tenth-Century Jerusalem: Karaite Exegesis, Prayer, and Communal Identity," in The Jews of Medieval Islam: Community, Society and Iden- tity, ed. D. Frank (Leiden, 1995), 199-245. See n. 106. 105 The answer of the Jews is unclear. I take it to mean that the Torah records many passionate prayers of biblical heroes, thus providing examples for the ritual prayers of later genera- tions. Surprisingly (or, perhaps, anticipating Bahr al-'Ulum's objections to post-biblical "innovations"), they do not even in- timate that the three daily prayers were rabbinically instituted as substitutes for the three daily sacrifices performed when the Temple was in existence. [of God's name] and supplication (duCa)."106 But he, may God support him, said to them: "We are not talking about invocation or about supplication, but rather about your specific and prescribed ritual prayer (salat) [recited] three times daily, morning, afternoon, and evening which are called tefilla shaharit, tefilla minhah, and tefilla arab.'07 As for invocation and supplication, there is a general com- mand to do them, but no specific command that ascribes specific times, and no direction [of prayer] is preferable to another, whereas you must face the Temple'08 during this ritual prayer, which is not a condition for invocation and supplication. "With regard to the prerequisite of facing the Temple, there is another difficulty, one from which I do not see you freeing yourselves, and it is this: the Temple was demar- cated by David and was built by his son Soloman. Now there were more than five hundred years between Soloman and Moses.109 So what was the status of Moses' prayer, and after him, of the prayers of the prophets, until the time of Soloman and his building of the Temple? Similar to this is what you must admit in the matter of pilgrimage (hajj). 106 Strictly speaking, the Muslim distinction of dhikr ("invo- cation" [of the Divine Name]) and ducd ("personal, private prayer") does not characterize Jewish liturgy, which tends to mix aspects of both forms, in addition to fixed prayers, such as the Amidah, recited three times daily. Al-Maghribi claims that the persecution of the Jews under the Persians (he does not spec- ify the period) led to the Jews' invention of "invocations into which they admixed passages from their prayers," which they called hizana. These were set to special tunes recited by the per- son leading the services known as the hazzan (Ifham al-yahud, 56-57; English tr., 57). 107 Bahr al-cUlum's argument echoes a well-known Karaite view, namely that "formal prayer should consist exclusively of biblical quotations, mainly the Psalms of David," which led the Karaites to reject many rabbinic prayers and hymns, even the Amidah, as unwarranted additions to the liturgy (Nemoy, Karaite Anthology, 272-73; Frank, "The Shoshanim"). The Sayyid's attempt to reproduce the actual Hebrew sounds is in- teresting although not entirely correct. The first and third forms should read tefillat shaharit and tefillat arvit (or tefillat erev?). 108 Bayt al-maqdis can refer to both Jerusalem and the Tem- ple, but in this and the following paragraph it seems to be more appropriate to translate it literally, as referring to the Temple. 109 Without dwelling on the complexities of biblical chronol- ogy, Bahr al-cUlum's calculation accords pretty well with tradi- tional Jewish reckoning, which places the Exodus some four hundred and eighty years before the construction of King So- lomon's Temple (A. Malamat, "Origins and Formative Period," in A History of the Jewish Period, ed. H. H. Ben-Sasson [Cambridge, Mass., 1976], 43). 583</page><page sequence="15">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) The pilgrimage for you is to the Temple, which was not in existence in the time of Moses, nor that of the prophets, until the time of Soloman."?0 Is this a thing you invented for yourselves, or do you possess any proof or evidence for it? 'Bring your proof (of what ye state) if you are truth- ful.'"'ll They answered: "We know this from the words of the prophets [who came] after Moses, and [from] their books, as well as from the commentaries of our sages (Culamic) on the Torah." But he said to them: "As for the prophets after Moses, they all [lived] according to his law, follow- ing him in his judgments, ruling according to the Torah, not adding or taking anything away from it. "Furthermore, you, O community of Jews, do not per- mit the abrogation of laws, so how are you permitted new inventions 12 which did not exist in the time of Moses? How is it possible for your sages to comment on the Torah by [adding] things that are extraneous to the law of Moses, and how can you attribute to the prophets their promulgation of these laws which are extraneous to the Torah?""l3 110 Bahr al-'Ulum seems determined to force his Jewish in- terlocutors to admit to either the existence in Jewish tradition of naskh ("abrogation"), or bidCa ("[reprehensible] innovation"), or both, with regard to prayer (see al-Maghribi, Ifham al-yahud, 20-21; English tr., 40-41). 11" Q 2:11. 112 Instead of bid'a, the Sayyid uses the word ihdath ("in- vention"), which has the same negative connotation here. 113 Karaite thinkers, such as al-Qirqisani, already raised these objections, which, in turn, were repeated by Ibn Hazm (C. Adang, "Elements karaites," 430-34). Ibn Kammuna (d. ca. 1285) gives the traditional Jewish (rabbinic) answers to these arguments: "Concerning the Jews following the stipulations of their chief authorities and judges, despite the Torah prohibition against adding or subtracting from the Law, know then that the Torah enjoined submission to the prophets who follow the Law of Moses [Deut. 18:18]. The Jewish sages say that the prophets may issue no command that would permanently annul any Torah stipulation, or they would not be followers of that law; but they may prescribe annulment when a situation requires it, on con- dition that the annulment not be continuous, as in the case of the prophet Elijah, who offered sacrifice in an unauthorized place- an annulment that could not be permanent" (Ibn Kammuna's Examination of the Three Faiths, ed. M. Perlmann [Berkeley, 1967], 46-47; English tr. [1971], 72). Clearly, Bahr al-'Ulum objects to Jewish religious concepts derived from the Oral Law (Aram., mi-de-rabbanan) overlooking similar lines of devel- opment in the sharfa based on hadith. His argument implies either that if the Torah omits important and necessary laws it is far from perfect, or, that if the Jews have added to its laws, they have tampered with divine revelation. They were perplexed by these words, silenced, and amazed by the profusion of his learning and this infor- mation regarding their own affairs and his understanding of their beliefs and writings. Then one of them got up the courage to ask: "[Suppose] we were to admit that there was no ritual prayer in the time of Moses; what are the implications which are then incumbent upon us?" He, may God the exalted sustain him, answered them: "You have just admitted that ritual prayer is prescribed in all religious laws, so how can the law of Moses which, according to you, is the greatest and most complete, lack it?14 Moreover, what called upon you to suffer the bur- den of performing this ritual prayer which did not exist in your prophet's time and was no specified in your Book?"'15 They were silenced and had no answer; they felt em- barrassed by the exposure in one [and the same] meeting of such inconsistency in their own words. Then one [of the Jews] said to the Sayyid: "The Qur'an does not elab- orate [the details] of the ritual prayers you perform, O community of Muslims, so how do you know them, de- spite the fact that the Qur'an lacks them?""6 He responded: "Ritual prayer is mentioned in several places in the Qur'an. We know from the Qur'an its num- ber, its direction, and many of its rules. The remaining rules and conditions we know from prophetic explicatory utterances as related in reliable traditions."7 So we are not equal in this matter, we and you, if you [would but] understand." 114 Seen. 113. 115 Al-Maghribi discusses at length, in the context of laws gov- erning Jewish dietary restrictions, how the Jews, especially the Rabbanites, have tended to "increase the burden upon themselves" (Ifham al-yahid, 71-79; English tr., 64-67). Specifically, in a pas- sage regarding prayer, which shows marked Karaite sympathies, he ridicules two passages in the Amidah on the grounds that they could not possibly have been recited by Moses. He accuses the Jews of having "fabricated them after the destruction of the Jewish state" along with fasts commemorating the burning of the Temple and the hanging of Haman (ibid., 21; English tr., 40). See Ibn Kammuna's replies to these contentions, Ibn Kammuna's Exami- nation, 46-47; English tr., 71. 116 The Jews, again displaying some familiarity with Islam, argue that the QurDan is equally "deficient" when it comes to the complete detailing of all the prayers incumbent on Muslims. 117 Khabar mutawatir, tradition passed down through nu- merous, congruent, uninterrupted and sound chains of trans- mission (isnad): see G. H. A. Juynboll, The Authenticity of the Tradition Literature (Leiden, 1969), 26, 31. Implicit in Bahr al-CUlm's reply is the lack of tawatur in the Bible, as opposed to the Qur'an: see Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 41-43. 584</page><page sequence="16">MOREEN: A Shici-Jewish "Debate" in the Eighteenth Century Next he said: "The Torah contains many laws which you do not observe now, such as the laws concerning purity and impurity until sunset, and others, [laws] re- garding touching those afflicted with venereal disease, menstruation, leprosy, a variety of [unclean] animals, and the contagion of the menses from women to men making the men who touch them as ritually unclean as the men- struating women."18 These laws are contained in chapters nine, ten, and eleven of the third book and in other places in the Torah [as well];119 you should return to them if [now] you do not perform them!" They answered: "Yes, this is all true, we agree and ac- cept your words." Afterward he said to them: "Why do you not perform these, although they are mentioned in the text of the To- rah which you claim is the one revealed to Moses, with- out corruption or alteration, and whose law you claim is universal for all people, exhaustive for all time, in which nothing has been abrogated? After the prophet Moses, only Jesus and Muhammad brought abrogation to his [Moses'] law. But you do not accept their prophethood or the abrogation of the law of Moses in any way." They replied: "This all pertains to the rule on command- ments, and a [positive] commandment can be changed in the course of time, as opposed to prohibitions [which can- not]. The [positive] commandment is [intended] to bring reward while the prohibition is [intended] to repel punish- ment, and thus they differ."120 118 Cf. Lev. 15:24. See al-Maghribi, Ifhdm al-yahud, 17; Eng- lish tr., 39, and Ibn Kammuna, Ibn Kammuna's Examination, 45; English tr., 71-72. The charge of Jewish women imparting men- struation to men was also known in Medieval Christendom (Joshua Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion [New York, 1977]), 8. 119 This reference is also inaccurate. While Lev. 11 deals with unclean animals, Lev. 9 and 10 deal with sacrificial laws. The laws regarding menstruation are mentioned in the context of impurities in Lev. 15:19-24. 120 It seems that here and in the argument about command- ments that follows the Jewish interlocutors and Bahr al-cUluim have different concepts in mind, for the polysemous Arabic term amr is by no means a simple synonym of the Hebrew con- cept of commandment (miswah). The Jews do not seem to give the Sayyid a direct answer perhaps because this would involve a lengthy explanation about why the laws of tahara ("purity") and tumca ("impurity") are no longer implementable. Instead, they hint at the complexity of the subject by stating that a positive commandment differs from a negative one in that it can be changed (see Ephraim E. Urbach, "The Commandments," ch. 13 of The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs [Cambridge, Mass., 1987], 345ff.). Bahr al-'Ulum still appears to have various He replied: "There is no difference between a [positive] commandment and a prohibition in regard to the obligation to obey and to adhere; abrogation is impossible without an abrogating [commandment] and without a cause. And if a commandment is positive, it is like a prohibition with regard to repelling punishment together with bringing re- ward. What you claim, that all these laws pertain to the rule of commandments, is not so. The wording of the Torah in these places occurs both in the language of command and in other ways, such as prohibition, forbidding, [demand- ing] purification, and [regarding] polution.121 "Produce the Torah and read it (unto us) if you be truthful."122 They then changed from this topic of conversation to another. Their chief said: "How come you do not judge according to the Torah, O community of Muslims, for the Qur'an says: 'Whoso judgeth not by that which Al- lah hath revealed: such are disbelievers.'"'23 He responded: "Since the prophecy of our prophet is established for us, and he abrogated previous laws, it is incumbent upon us to follow the laws that abrogate rather than those that are abrogated. This is just as you must fol- low the law of Moses, and must carry out what is in the Torah, without [obeying] the religions, laws, and scrip- tures that preceded it. A group of the laws of the Torah have remained which have not been abrogated, such as the laws [regarding] injuries, retaliation, and others.'24 But we rule in accord with these because they exist in the Qur'an, not because they are found in the Torah."125 conditions and types of naskh on his mind (Wansbrough, Qur'anic Studies, 197). 121 Bahr al-cUlum realizes that the Jews are not addressing his question directly and chides them for distinguishing between positive and negative commandments as far as their duty to obey both types equally is concerned. He emphasizes that the laws of purification in Leviticus are expressed clearly as both positive and negative commandments and thus cannot be denied. 122 Sura 3:93. 123 Sura 5:44. Since the Jewish interlocutors do not appear to be particularly learned in Jewish subjects, is it believable that they can quote the Qur'an? On the lack of Hebrew translations of the Qur'an (they tend to be late and rare) and general Jewish ignorance of the Qur'an, see Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 144-60. 124 For example, the Muslim punishment for adultery-ston- ing-which is based on Deut. 22:22-24 (Wansbrough, Qur'anic Studies, 194-96, and Michael Cook, "CAnan and Islam: The Ori- gins of Karaite Scripturalism," JSAI [1987]: 176). 125 Cf. Ibn Hazm, who believed that "the Muslim attitude toward the scriptures [of others] should be one of absolute re- jection. The Muslim accepts only the Koran, and only from the Koran he knows of previous revelations, among them one 585</page><page sequence="17">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) Then he [the Jew] asked: "What is the meaning of His verse: 'Such of Our revelations as We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, we bring [in place] one better or the like thereof'?'26 What is the difference between abrogating (naskh) and causing to forget (insa')? What is the benefit in abrogating something and then instituting something like it?" He replied: "The difference between abrogating and causing something to be forgotten is that abrogation re- moves the legal provision (hukm) even if the text which ordains it remains, while causing something to be for- gotten is removing it [the rule] by removing the text which denotes it and wiping it off the mind completely. What is meant by 'something like it' is the rule which is similar to the first, according to its beneficial effect, so that its benefit in its own time is equivalent to the benefit of the first rule in its own time, not that the utility of both is the same during the same time, in which case abrogation, of necessity, would be of no use." They laughed and were amazed by the excellence of his reply and the beauty of the argument in his speech. He said: "O community of Jews, had we perceived in you a desire and solicitousness in searching for truth, we would have brought you clear proofs and overpowering evidence.127 But I counsel you with the most perfect of proofs to act with fairness, abandon blind imitation (taq- lid)128 and the following of your fathers and forefathers, called Torah and one called Gospel ..." (Perlmann, "Eleventh Century," 275). 126 Sura 2:106. See above, n. 123. This argument is really addressed to a Muslim audience since it deals with the contro- versial issue of the various aspects of naskh as understood by Muslim legists (Wansbrough, Qur2anic Studies, 197). 127 In what follows, the Sayyid clearly reveals his desire to convert the Jews. 128 It is interesting to note that although taqlid became even more important after the triumph of the Usulis (see above, n. 20: Momen, An Introduction, 204), Bahr al-cUlum, although he was himself an usuli mujtahid-and probably addressing himself as much (if not more) to his Muslim as to his Jewish audience-decries the tendency to blind imitation attributed here to the Jews. Already Ibn Hazm reprimanded those who were following their ancestors blindly (taqlid al-aslif) even when their leaders knew better (Kitab al-fisal 1: 99f., quoted in Perlmann, "Eleventh Century," 280). In another part of this opus, while discussing "the views of atheists, deists, and agnostics," Ibn Hazm distinguishes a group of rationalists as follows: "Another group said: a man's adherence to the religion of his father and grandfather or lord or neighbor is neither an excuse for him nor an argument for that religion. But every man should accept those doctrines which all the religions as and to abandon bigotry, fanaticism, and stubbornness. For verily the world is perishable and finite, 'every soul will taste of death'129 and God's servants must meet God, the exalted, in eternity, on the great day after which there will be nothing but lasting felicity or grievous torment. The wise[man] is he who prepares himself for that day, is concerned about it, and embarks in this world on cor- recting [his] beliefs, carries out the works with which he is enjoined and contemplates critically the various faiths and diverse denominations. But Truth cannot be on two contradictory sides. No one can bring as an excuse the fact that he imitates [the ways of his] father and grand- father, or accepts a denomination or faith without proof or evidence. For the same rule applies to all people as re- gards fathers and forefathers. If this were an acceptable way to salvation, everyone would be saved and all people would be safe! But this would do away with religion and make faith and unbelief equal. Infidels and idolaters fol- low in the tracks of their fathers, but they are not excused for it. [Their] following of their tradition does not save them from destruction and ruin.130 So, save your souls from the torture of the fire and the wrath of the Almighty 'on the day when hidden thoughts shall be searched out,' 13 veils will be rent, intercession will be of no avail, nor close friends, helpers, or protectors. Therefore it is incumbent on you to rid yourselves of prejudices that prevent you from turning to the Truth, and from the well as all thinking men in general have agreed to consider right and commendable" (M. Perlmann, "Ibn Hazm on the Equivalence of Proofs" JQR 40 (1949-50): 279, 284). 129 Sura 3:185. 130 Bahr al-'UlTim's reasoning is close to al-Maghribi's: ... we realize that reason does not oblige us to accept ances- tral tradition without examining it as to its soundness, merely because it has been handed down from ancestors, but obliges us to accept tradition only if it be a verity per se, and if there is proof of its soundness. Mere reference to fathers and ancestry, however, is no proof. For if it were, it would serve all the infidel rivals as well .... Should it be claimed that emulation of the ancestors be correct only in the case of the Jews, this would not be accepted unless the Jews proved that their ancestors were wiser than those of other peoples. The Jews may make such a claim with respect to their fathers and ancestors, but all reports about their ancestors give the Jews the lie in this matter. Once we abandon partisanship in their favor, their ancestors are put on the same footing as those of other peoples" (Ifham al- yahaid, 103-4; English tr., 79-80, also quoted in M. Perlmann, "The Medieval Polemics between Islam and Judaism," in Reli- gion in a Religious Age, ed. S. D. Goitein [Cambridge, Mass., 1974], 115-16). 131 Sura 86:9. 586</page><page sequence="18">MOREEN: A ShtCi-Jewish "Debate" in the Eighteenth Century causes diverting [you] from integrity, to remove the in- clination towards the faith of [your] fathers and fore- fathers, and to turn to the Lord of mankind, striving to seek that which saves from torture on the Day of Return. This requires the beneficial spiritual exercise of the soul and its salutary struggle as God, the exalted, has said: '[As for] those who strive in Us, we surely guide them to our paths.'32 All revealed scriptures speak in this way, and it is mentioned by all the prophets who have been sent. All sound minds corroborate it and all penetrating, straight- forward views lead to it. Turn to God in your beliefs and mend them; correct your deeds and save your souls; do not cause them to perish! No one is left with anything but his soul when his spirit separates itself and he descends into the grave. I do not want [to accomplish] anything with my speech except to advise you as much as I can, even though you do not like advisers." They said: "Your words are precious to us and we accept them. We seek Truth and we desire that which is right and truthful." He asked them: "What incited you to choose and prefer the Jewish over the Muslim faith?" They replied: "The followers of [the monotheistic] faiths, namely Jews, Christians, and Muslims, agree about the prophecy of Moses, [about] the firm ground of his law, and the revelation of the Torah to him. They disagree regarding the prophecy of Jesus, the prophecy of Muham- mad, God's blessings be upon him, about the Gospels, and about the Qur'an. We chose that about which everyone is in agreement and refrained from that about which they disagree."'33 He, may God the exalted sustain him, said to them: "Muslims believe in the prophecy of Moses and in the truthfulness of his mission because of the message of their righteous and reliable prophet [Muhammad] and the fact that he [Moses] is mentioned in their book, the Qur'an. Were it not for this they [Muslims] would not acknowl- 132 Sura 26:69. 133 The Jews speak here as if they had made a conscious, ra- tional choice of faith rather than merely following the faith of their ancestors. This polemical topos was addressed already much earlier by both Jews and Muslims. Cf. Abu Bakr al- Baqillani's (d. 1013) reply (in Kitab al-tamhid, ed. R. McCarthy [Beirut, 1957], 160-90) to various Jewish claims, among them the assertion that Christians and Muslims accept the prophet- hood of Moses (cited in Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu, 151, no. 8), and the Spanish Hebrew poet Yehudah ha-Levi's (d. 1141) argument regarding the general recognition of the Jewish scripture as a basis for the Khazar king's investigation of, and eventual conversion to, Judaism (The Kuzari, tr. H. Hirschfeld, [New York, 1964], 44ff). edge the prophecy of Moses and Jesus, or the Torah and the Gospels.'34 But you do not similarly accept the testi- mony of Christians and Muslims in anything. So, how can you admit their testimony, for they testify against you re- garding idolatry and deviation from the truth? Thus there remains for you nothing except your own testimony in re- gard to yourselves, and it is of no benefit to you."'35 They were perplexed by his clear words and by this eloquent and powerful assertion. They looked at one an- other and desisted for a long time. Then CUzayr, a young man among them, said: "Dear sir, shall I give a short, useful speech by way of advice and out of affection? Listen and contemplate it and be fair; it shall be a proof against you." He replied: "All right; what is this speech?" He [CUzayr] said: "In our scripture, that is to say in the Torah, the advent of a prophet after Moses [is mentioned], but he would be from among our brothers, not from the children of Ishmael."136 But he countered: "The Torah mentions this good news in chapter twelve of the fifth book, and its translation is: 'Verily, the Exalted said to Moses: "I will set up for you,"- that is, for the children of Israel-"a prophet from among the sons of their brothers [who is] like you, so let them believe in him and listen to him." '37 And the brothers of the children of Israel are the children of Ishmael. Israel is Jacob, son of Isaac, the brother of Ishmael.138 Therefore, the 134 See above, n. 125. 135 Al-Maghribi adduced this entire line of argument: "Should they [the Jews] say: 'All the nations bear witness to our prophet, therefore the transmission [tawatur] is stronger in his favor; how can you say then that it is weaker?' We [Muslims] should say: 'Is the consensus of the nations' testimony true in your opinion?' Should they say yes, we say: 'But the nations whose evidence you have just accepted are unanimous in declaring you unbelievers living in error; this is now binding upon you inasmuch as their evidence is accepted by you.' Should they [the Jews] say, 'we do not accept anybody's evidence' they will be left only with the chain of transmission of their own commu- nity, which is the smallest community numerically, and their transmission and religion would, consequently, be the least sound" (Ifham al-yahud, 26-27; English tr., 43). See also n. 130 above. 136 Deut. 18:15 is often confused in polemical literature, or discussed in conjunction with Deut. 18:18-19 (Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 104-6). 137 Both the reference and its Arabic translation are some- what off. 138 This is an old argument employed already by the Chris- tian apostate CAli b. Rabban al-Tabari (ninth century) in his Kitab al-din wa'l-dawla, tr. A. Mingana (London, 1923), 85ff. 587</page><page sequence="19">Journal of the American Oriental Society 119.4 (1999) prophet who is promised is from the offspring of Ishmael. This is proof in our favor, not against us." CUzayr was greatly embarrassed, turned colors, bit his fingertips, and did not say anything after this. Then he [the Sayyid] returned to giving them advice. He said to them: "You know of my knowledge of your books and ways, and of my knowledge regarding the way of your forefathers and [their] successors. I wish to put an end to your excuses by removing your errors. If there is some- one among you who is more learned than you are, go back to him, find out what he knows. Bring him to me; you have an entire year to do so.139 But return to God and do not persist in your transgression." They said: "We believe in the prophecy of Moses through his brilliant miracles and manifest signs." But he asked them: "Were you alive in Moses' time and did you see these miracles and signs with your own eyes?"'40 They replied: "We heard about them." Then he replied: "Have you not also heard about the miracles of Muham- mad, may God's blessing be upon him, about his proofs, signs, and his evident miracles?141 How come you be- lieve the former and disbelieve the latter, despite the fact that Moses' time is distant from you and Muhammad's is closer? It is well known that hearing differs in intensity and weakens, according to whether the time is close or distant. Whenever the time span is longer, belief is more difficult, and whenever it is shorter, belief is easier. As for us, the community of Muslims, we accepted both oral Ibn Hazm also refers to it (Perlmann, "The Medieval Polem- ics," 114), and al-Maghribi, commenting on Deut. 2:4, where the children of Esau are referred to as "brethren," argues: "Now if the children of Esau were brethren to the children of Israel because Esau and Israel [Jacob] were the sons of Isaac, the children of Ishmael are likewise brethren of all the progeny of Abraham" (Ifham al-yahud, 29-30; English tr., 45). 139 The Sayyid appears more than a little displeased by the low level of argumentation presented by his Jewish opponents. There may be an implicit threat, rather than a gracious dis- missal, in the year long "deadline" allotted to the Jews. 140 See al-Baqillani's similar argument in his Kitab al-tam- hid, cited in Wansbrough, The Sectarian Milieu, 151, no. 5, and especially al-Maghribi: "By what do you recognize the prophethood of Moses? If they [the Jews] say: 'By the miracles he performed,' we [Muslims] say to them: 'Have any of you seen those miracles?' This is indeed no way to verify the prophetic mission; for it would follow that the miracles should be perpet- uated beyond the lifetime of the prophet in order that every generation might behold the miracles and believe them..." (Ifham al-yahud, 25; English tr., 42-43). 141 Cf. al-Baqillani, Kitab al-tamhid (Wansbrough, The Sec- tarian Milieu, 151-52, nos. 1 and 22). traditions [of Judaism and Islam] and combined these two proofs; we believe in the prophecy of both prophets. We do not differentiate between any of [God's] prophets and His scriptures, and we do not say, as you do: 'We be- lieve some of them and disbelieve others.'42 Praise be to God who guided us to this; we would not have been rightly guided had God not guided us. The prophets of our Lord brought the Truth." Then he [also] said to them: "If Abraham were to ask you: 'Why did you abandon my religion and my faith? Why did you wind up in the religion and faith of Moses?' What would you answer him?"'43 They replied: "We would say to Abraham: 'You are the predecessor and Moses is the suc- cessor; the law (hukm) does not belong to the predecessor after [the manifestation of] a successor.'"44 But he answered them: "What if Muhammad said to you: 'Why do you not follow my faith, since I am the successor and Moses is the predecessor?' You have said: 'The law does not belong to the predecessor after [the manifestation of] the successor,' and I brought you man- ifest signs, brilliant miracles, and the eternal Qur'an which endures through time. What would your answer be to this?" Following this they desisted, became perplexed, and brought forward no [other arguments]. "Thus was the dis- believer abashed."145 He turned to their elder, saying: "I will ask you some- thing. Tell me the truth, and do not say anything other than the truth. Have you tried to seek faith and acquire 142 Sura 4:150. 143 This argument returns to the issue of abrogation. Ibn Hazm has clearly stated: inna sharicata Yacqub... ghayru sharicat Musa (M. Schreiner, "Geschichte der Polemik zwi- schen Juden und Muhammedanern," ZDMG 42 [1888]: 654). Along the same lines, al-Maghribi maintains: "If it is pos- sible that the law of the Torah should proscribe that which has been considered lawful by Abraham and others before him, then it is possible that still another law should declare lawful that which has been forbidden in the Torah" (Ifhdm al-yahud, 9; English tr., 35). 144 This answer is most likely on the part of the Jews as it contains more than a touch of the concept of Muslim super- session of earlier revelations (Wansbrough, Qur'dnic Studies, 192ff.), although it may, perhaps, allude to the halakic concept of halaka ke-batrai ("the law is according to the last [most recent, authorities]"), which, of course, does not imply abroga- tion of a previous legal interpretation, but rather refers to the cumulative growth and development of a law that builds upon and amplifies the ideas of predecessors (Ensiqlopedia Talmudit [Jerusalem, 1959], 9: 341-45, s.v., "halaka ke-batrai"). 145 Sura 2:258. 588</page><page sequence="20">MOREEN: A ShFli-Jewish "Debate" in the Eighteenth Century knowledge and certainty since you reached maturity [i.e., the age when religious laws became obligatory for you] until now?" He replied: "In fairness, until now I have not been in this valley and [these arguments] never occurred to my conscience or to my heart. I chose the faith of Moses because he was our prophet and no proof was shown to us that would abrogate this prophecy. We have not examined the religion of Muhammad closely nor have we investigated it truly. 146 We shall contemplate this and shall bring to you news regarding what occurs to us in this matter." With this the session folded, the discussion ceased, praise be to the God of the people of excellence and dis- tinction. May blessings and peace be upon Muhammad, lord of mankind, and upon the family of his pious, precious imams. 146 See above, p. 587. 589</page></plain_text>
