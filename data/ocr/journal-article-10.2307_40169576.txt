The publication in 1987 of a new novel by Frank Waters; of the first paperback edition of Pike's Peak (a novel of 1971 rewritten from a trilogy of the 1930s, The Wild Earth* Nobility, Below Grass Roots, and The Dust Within the Rock); and of a revised edition of The Woman at Otowi Crossing, presages Frank Waters's continuing recog- nition outside his native Southwest. Although he was born in 1902 and published his first novel, Fever Pitch, in 1930, Waters is not so much a neglected writer from the past as he is a prophetic writer of the present and of the immediately foreseeable future, so perhaps it is fitting that attention is now coming his way. He has been contin- uously nominated since 1985 for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Studies in Frank Waters is an annual newsletter distributed by Pro- fessor Charles Adams at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to members of Waters's scholarly and popular following. The monu- mental A Literary History of the American West (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press, 1987) contains an important chapter on Waters, also by Adams. A growing number of serious scholars hold the surprising opinion - yet a tenable one difficult to abjure - that Alexander L. Blackburn is Professor of English at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, where he founded and edits Writers' Forum, a national literary journal. He is a widely published literary analyst, a novelist, and one of the recognized experts on the work of Frank Waters.</page><page sequence="2">536 -fr Journal of the Southwest Frank Waters is the major American writer in our time. Fortunately, most of Waters's twenty-three books, including twelve novels, have remained in print and enjoy steady sales. The Man Who Killed the Deer prospers in both Swallow Press and Pocket Books editions, and Book of the Hopi in the Viking-Penguin edition. Swallow Press has recently reissued The Colorado in a handsome paperback edition as well. Considering this steady attention, why has the literary and aca- demic "establishment" neglected Waters? Part of the answer is that he is a westerner: writers of the West tend to be anathematized as regionalists, as writers of horse-operas and moral fables, as outcasts of American literary tradition, which means of course literature mostly east of the Mississippi and tradition mostly trans-Atlantic. Then, too, Waters seems to elude classification or to be classified pejoratively as a "mystic." Yet Waters belongs to a literary genera- tion which includes, among others, William Faulkner (b. 1897), Ernest Hemingway (b. 1899), Thomas Wolfe (b. 1900) and John Steinbeck (b. 1902). When compared to such writers, Waters may yet be regarded as the writer of his generation who, in searching the meaning of his own unsought experience, has come on the moral and spiritual meaning of his time, to some degree more than they did. Waters is, in short, a writer with a vision of a new age. The 1971 edition of Pike's Peak is subtitled "A Family Saga: An Epic Journey of the American Soul"; the 1987 reprint of that edi- tion is subtitled "A Mining Saga." Certainly there are elements of saga and epic in this long novel. Pike's Peak is the story of the Rogier family which lives at the foot of the mountain in Colorado Springs for three generations, from the 1870s through world war and depression. It is also the story of mining as part of the settle- ment of the West, particularly of gold-mining in the Cripple Creek region, once the world's most fabulous source of mineral wealth. As an epic celebrates a people's heroic tradition, so, to an extent, does Pike's Peak. The increasingly monomaniacal quest of Joseph Rogier - the excessively masculine, emotionally blocked, but essen- tially noble, tragic hero - is a paradigm of Euro-American history in its New World inflections on the frontier. Historical experiences of exile, conquest, and colonization, of dreams of a better life, of faith in mechanical progress, and of belief in a divinely ordained mission to the wilderness are gathered here at the heart of the continent where the peak is beacon, prophet of revelation, and numinous</page><page sequence="3">FrankWaters -fr 537 source, like Melville's white whale. The westward migration of American people is also a psychological journey in depth, an aspect of epic tradition. The most important thematic passages in Pike's Peak involve us in Rogier's psychic search for the meaning of life in the mountain. In these passages Waters most nearly appropriates for poetic purposes the epic convention of interaction between men and gods, for the peak is Rogier's God. Novels thrive on the community of feeling established through irony; sagas and epics do not. For this reason Pike's Peak is a novel: Waters is an ironist, even though readers frequently mistake him for a mystic, a didactic moralist, or an allegorist. For example, some have complained that Waters tells us about Rogier's feelings instead of letting Rogier act for himself and thereby develop in us a sympa- thetic response.1 But the presence of dramatic irony in descriptions of Rogier's feelings invalidates this complaint. Those passages in which Rogier thinks he is coming to terms with the secret of the universe dramatically convey his tragic mistake in believing that life's secret heart lies outside himself, in the peak. He projects upon the peak the archetypal contents of his own unconscious. When he finally realizes that he has been mining in the wrong place, that the secret is inside him, he elicits the response of pity reserved for the tragic hero, for an Oedipus, say, precisely because his action has been structured toward peripeteia and its aftermath. Although Rogier recognizes his mistake and how ruinous it has been for his family, he cannot change the habits of his mind. He cannot bring his intuitive faculties into balance with reason, thereby integrating personality in relation to itself, society, the land and ultimately the universe. His granitic masculine will, the stuff of western heroes, will not accept the feminine softness of adobe, Waters's symbol of the Indians' Tightness with earth. So Rogier goes mad in old age. Singlehandedly he tries to dig a tunnel from his garden, beneath the city of Little London (which in youth he had helped to build), toward the peak, toward "the brightness and the glory, the incan- descent mystery of that secret and immortal Self which had forever hovered in his mind like something risen from the depths of dream- less sleep to the horizon of wakeful consciousness" (615). His tun- nel collapses upon him; humbled at last, he dies. Lest the final 1. See Charles L. Adams, "On Pike's Peak? Writers' Forum 11 (1985) : 195-208. Adams discusses some early criticism of this novel.</page><page sequence="4">538 -&gt; Journal of the Southwest madness fail to evoke our sympathy, Waters dramatizes in the career of Rogier's grandson, March Cable, the great spirit required for the quest. March, however, who has begun by repeating Rogier's error of searching for gold, for self, in the earth, redirects his quest inwardly and glimpses the myth of emergence, "all humanity streaming out from its common womb of the unconscious, begin- ning its slow climb into the light and freedom of consciousness" (718). A controlling irony, then, reveals the meaning of Pike's Peak, Waters is so interesting as a philosopher that one is apt to over- look his achievement as an artist in fiction. Under the pressure of a world- view as well as of ordinary narrative demands, a passage such as the following from Pike's Peak shows a high degree of technical skill. It is a claustrophobic soliloquy or interior monologue that reveals a character's inner thoughts and convictions as they would be if the silence of the unconscious mind were consciously verbalized. At the same time, the ironies of silence thrust themselves upon our attention. Rogier differs from gold-diggers like Stratton, the "Midas of the Rockies," because Rogier's peak is a religious symbol of a timeless, living universe rather than just a material object of exploi- tation, though it is that too. Rogier, however else anyone knew him, was a man for whom time had stopped. The flowing linear stream of time - what an illusion it really was! Time was a great still pool, an element as basic as earth and air, water and fire, in which life developed at its own immeasurable pace to its own degree of fulfillment. Time! what did it mean to him now? In that invisible, immea- surable, impalpable pool both he and the Peak had been rooted for aeons to confront at last the meaning of their inner selves. Rogier kept staring at it in moonlight and in sunlight, at its dual faces of benign motherliness and masculine malig- nity, combined into an enigmatic mask which now he recog- nized for what it was. In geologic time it had stood there, a monstrous volcano belching fire and smoke upon a world that had sunk beneath forgotten seas. It had stood there in orogenic time, a lofty snow-crowned peak looking down upon a virgin continent yet unraped by greedy man. Through the quick gasp of a century it had remained inviolable while lesser prophets, robed in silver, had been gutted of their riches. . . . For he also was a growth within that immovable,</page><page sequence="5">Frank Waters * 539 immeasurable, deep still pool of time, as old as the Peak itself. And now at last in their moment of truth and fruition they faced each other like two adversaries bound together in a com- mon selfhood. Over them both a common golden sun rose and set. Through both their flesh ran the veins of liquid golden life, pulsating to the same diastolic and systolic beat. And in each of them glowed the reflection of the one great sun, the golden sun that was the heart of all. Gold! A great gold heart embodied in the depths of that extinct volcano whose remnant was the puny Peak. A heart whose beat was in rhythm with his own; whose meaning, if he could but fathom it, would illumine for him the secret of his existence which had seemed so alien to this mortal earth. Of course he would reach it, if he had to blast the whole dom top off the Peak and dig by hand down to the convergence of its golden veins in the heart that lay beneath! For time, the human illusion of flow- ing time, no longer existed. He had been born for this, geological eras, biological ages ago. Born as an incipient mam- mal to grow into an individual egohood only to seek and to find at last that universal self which combined within it both himself and the massive Peak whose granite armor he was meant to pierce. (311- 12) The philosophical, religious, and scientific capability of Rogier's intuitive and rational mind is overthrown by faulty logic that has its implied source in solipsism, egomania, and anthropomorphism. This builder who measures things wants the "immeasurable" (re- peated three times) to yield itself in his own image, even if he has to blast "the whole dom top off." The gloss on this passage is provided in another, climactic soliloquy: "The great snowy Peak itself was. . . like himself, a material shell, a transient symbol" (658). Waters spent several decades before 1971, in which Pikei Peak appeared, on deepening inquiry into the correspondence between psychic and physical events and into the possible transcendence of these in some higher principle for which he makes the word "apper- ception" (449) pull duty. Already in Masked Gods: Navabo and Pueblo Ceremonialism, published in 1950, Waters had been seeking to consolidate the Indian idea of an evolutionary round, or emer- gence, as an integrative myth by means of which the awesome terror of the Atomic Age could be put in perspective. He was in the right</page><page sequence="6">540 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest place for that investigation: from 1952 to 1956 he served as informa- tion consultant for Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. In 1951 the Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, delivered his speculative paper "On Synchronicity,55 isolating for study the coincidence of a psychic state with a corresponding, not yet existent future event that is distant in time and only verifiable afterward. Thus when Waters completed the first version of The Woman at Otowi Crossing in 1957 after five years of work, it contained not only important historical and scientific information, some of it still classified, but also an authoritatively defined physical and psychological phenomenon, synchronicity, now available for fictional treatment. By means of synchronicity a fic- tional character could participate acausally in the apocalyptic pos- sibility of technological power and, at the same time, symbolize the human power to emerge with increased awareness into a new age. Publication of the novel was delayed until 1966. Even then Waters was obliged to omit certain classified information and to trim parts of narrative that had rounded out the lives of leading characters. The arrival in 1987 of a revised edition of The Woman at Otowi Crossing is thus a literary event of magnitude. The restored material recounts the atomic development project in better perspective than did the 1966 edition and rounds out more fully the characters of Emily, Jack, and, above all, the scientist Gaylord. The new edition comes at a time, moreover, when superpowers are negotiating re- duction of nuclear arsenals - evidence of increased awareness? - and when an increasing number of people is finding as a subject of concern the attainment of a higher level of consciousness, precisely Waters's theme. A lesser writer than Waters might be flummoxed by the apoc- alyptic premise of the Atomic Age - that is, one nuclear war equals the death of mankind. But The Woman at Otowi Crossing is a ma- turely poised and warmly beautiful story. Its message is one of hope. On an immediate level it is the story of the last years of an "ordinary55 middle-aged woman, Helen Chalmers. As the story opens, she and her lover, Jack Turner, are waiting at a railroad whistlestop for the arrival of Helen's twenty-year-old daughter by a previous marriage, Emily. It is soon apparent that Helen, who aban- doned Emily in infancy, has accumulated psychological dynamite - guilt, shame, and fear of financial failure- during almost twenty years of lonely isolation in a remote area of northern New Mexico called Otowi Crossing. Emily does not arrive that day, but an army</page><page sequence="7">Frank Waters * 541 colonel does, ominously inquiring about a school called "Los Al- amos" on the mesa above Otowi Crossing. Soon after experiencing a faint premonition, Helen discovers that she has breast cancer. Realizing she cannot marry Turner, she contemplates the seeming futility of her life. Just then she has the first of her mystical visions, a "fusion" (21) of self into the complete pattern of the universe. After many misgivings and resentments about this awakening, she courageously accepts the power of destiny that drives her, commits herself to its fulfillment, and painfully sacrifices intimacy with the two persons she most loves, Turner and Emily. Doomed and yet reborn, with only an old Indian from the nearby pueblo, Facundo, to understand her integrity and psychic power, she has terrifying precognitive dreams, the content of which appalls her - nothing less, as we know through dramatic irony, than A-Bomb and H-Bomb explosions, even planetary disappearance. She nevertheless grows in spiritual power and becomes a benevolent influence on many who know her, including physicists from the secret city of Los Alamos who are experimenting with another, opposite kind of power. Helen influences one of these physicists, Edmund Gaylord, so much that, as he is observing the first H-Bomb detonation over the Pacific, he has telepathic knowledge of the moment of her death and transfiguration, the triumph of spirit over matter. That is the story on one immediate level. Waters never permits us to lose sight of Helen as a flesh-and-blood woman who suffers into wisdom; who swims in the nude and responds exuberantly to the natural world; who enjoys sex and friendship; who cooks and who nurses the afflicted. Waters counterpoints the four parts of her myth, however - breakthrough to hidden reality, learning to live in a new world of freedom, exercise of released psychic energy, and its constructive influence on others - to the myth of science whose hierophants successively break through to the new world of sub- atomic energy, release it, and victimize themselves and masses of humanity with radioactive fall-out. So another immediate level of the story is a history of the Atomic Age from the Manhattan Project through the Trinity Site (first atomic explosion, July 16, 1945), Hiroshima, experiments in the Nevada desert, and the H-Bomb explosion in the Marshall Islands. The interaction of these levels comes to a critical mass that fissions Helen's mind, then fuses or unifies it as an emergence. This myth (from mythos, "tale") is the actual story of The Woman at Otowi Crossing. Lest the woman in her</page><page sequence="8">542 &lt;■ Journal of the Southwest mythic role seem to impose upon modern sensibilities, Waters al- lows various characters to raise our objections for us: a strategy of an ironist. Turner thinks Helen is a neurotic recluse in danger of becoming a psychotic lost in a meaningless dream-state. Emily, an anthropologist with scientific pretensions, is upset by her mother's mythological interpretation of historical signs. Throckmorton, a pu- erile politician, sees Helen as easy prey for his manipulation. All of these characters get their comeuppance. Turner's pragmatism is a betrayal of trust that loses him any chance for a complete relation- ship with Helen. Emily's sterile science is of no emotional help; after aborting her child by Gaylord, she comes to an academic dead- end in a Mexican university. Throckmorton's goose is cooked when Turner tricks him into making public an idiotic proposal for bomb- ing America's enemies. While the fates of these characters may not remove all rationalistic-materialistic objections to the myth of emer- gence, they do indicate some validation of Helen's normalcy and moral wholeness. The most convincing validation of these comes from the story of Gaylord, to whom focus shifts in the last third of the novel. Repeat- ing the pattern of Helen's emergence, but with a terraced crescendo, he inherits her archetype as a moving principle of life. Thenceforth his spiritual effort is to hold to the experience in loyalty, courage, and love beyond fear and desire. In mythological terms this "gay lord" is like the questing hero from grail legends: an impotent Fisher King of the Atomic Waste-Land is cured of his wound and given reign over a regenerated world. When we first encounter him, he is dedicated to science at the expense of emotional development. He is little more than a dehumanized robot isolated from his family and the teeming life of cities. In spite of his duty to science, though, he feels drawn to Emily shortly after his arrival at Los Alamos. Therein lies his dilemma, for security regulations strictly forbid courtship. When Emily becomes pregnant, Gaylord procrastinates, betraying the dictates of his heart at the very hour when a historical Klaus Fuchs is passing atom-bomb secrets over to Harry Gold - that big a betrayal. Gaylord gets his bomb at Trinity, his secret; Emily gets an abortion, her secret. Gaylord, unaware of the abor- tion and beginning to mature emotionally, no longer feels alienated from his family and tribe in New York. When he is sterilized by radioactivity during an accident at Los Alamos, the tragic irony of his apparently irreversible fate - as guilt-ridden as Helen's had</page><page sequence="9">Frank Waters * 543 been - is his belated feeling of compassion for humanity. The climax of Gaylord's story occurs in Nevada when a "shot" fails to explode after countdown and it is his duty to climb the tower to defuse the bomb. At this moment he experiences disassociation from the in- stinctual pattern of fear and guilt which has constituted his emo- tional field. Having attained spiritual detachment, Gaylord discon- nects the jinxed bomb and, later in Las Vegas, finds the courage to "connect" his presumably lost manhood with a willing "show-biz" goddess, a lunar deity named Monday Willis. In a wonderfully comic scene, Monday breaks down the barriers of Gaylord's isola- tion and comments, "Jesus, but it's taken you a long time!" (278). For those readers who want from Waters just an old-fashioned romantic yarn, Flight from Fiesta should fill the bill. A selfish little Anglo girl of ten, Elsie, comes to the annual fiesta in Santa Fe with her divorced mother and the mother's lover. Elsie runs away and meets Inocencio, an old alcoholic Pueblo Indian reduced to selling pottery beneath the portal of the Palace of Governors. She maneu- vers Inocencio into taking her away with him and helping her to steal a car. In the wake of her disappearance, Inocencio is suspected of kidnapping and perhaps molesting her. A posse forms, including in its ranks the hysterical mother and a character called Indian Hater (he comes right out of nineteenth-century frontier folklore). The frightened Inocencio saves Elsie from a depraved Navajo rapist, kills him in a knife fight, and flees to Indian country, too good- hearted to abandon his companion. Their week-long flight provides a tour of ancient ruins, pueblos, and cave-dwellings of New Mexico and ends when Indian Hater shoots Inocencio off the cliff where he is bared against a backdrop of big sky. If you think you have seen the movie, you are almost correct: Waters originally wrote Flight from Fiesta in 1957 as a film treat- ment, but the film was never made. Waters later rewrote the treat- ment and the technical shooting script to form the first version of the novel.2 These origins explain the melodrama, the outdoor scenic setting, the "chase" formula, and the stereotypical minor characters defined by a simple plot. They do not explain the warmth and compassion developed between the girl and the Indian. The recon- ciliation of the fugitives from different races, given the theme of 2. See Charles L.

Western American Literature 21 (1987): 195-200.</page><page sequence="10">544 -fr Journal of the Southwest emergence in Waters's mature work, is not a lapse into sentimen- tality, didacticism, or allegory. Against the background of antiquity, the girl-man relationship is ageless and purified. Although he could abandon Elsie and save himself, Inocencio elects to give her the security she needs and sacrifices his life for the sake of the "common humanness" (102) acknowledged in their essential selves. The "great forest cathedral" in which "two happy children" share "an idyllic interlude" of "sympathy and trust" (101-2) is powerful archetypal imagery. It recalls the chapel in the heart of nature which European poets in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries symbolized as the ground of one's own and the world's true being, surrounded by wilderness and threatened by conventional society. Waters aligns himself in a seemingly local-color scenario with European literary tradition: love as a dying from the world in order to come to birth from within, the mystery of sex being the given in what Waters calls "transcendental experience" (139). If Flight from Fiesta adds any- thing to the Waters canon, it is this emphasis, subtextually erotic and taboo, on love between unidealized representatives of different races and cultures. Flight from Fiesta is a deceptively simple story irradiated by a love of land and peoples as Waters has gained it through a lifetime in the Southwest. His latest novel contributes to his vision of a new age of consciousness.*</page></plain_text>
