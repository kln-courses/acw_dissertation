His focus here is on the ethnographic display of weapons, both historically and in the Pacific Encounters exhibition. Introduction The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle, sweeping round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying implement From Moby Dick by Herman Melville. Ethnographic weapons are conventionally displayed with little discussion of their original use and cultural context. One presumes that this happens because we understand that weapons are tools for killing people - a partial truth that inevitably leads to misleading museum experiences. My aims in this paper are threefold. I will offer a brief general characterization of the use of weaponry in Polynesian cultures. Then I will discuss the cultural politics of representation as it has been manifested with reference to the Western consumption of Polynesian weaponry. Following this, I will discuss critically the approach to weaponry taken in the Pacific Encounters exhibition held at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in 2006. 1 Pacific Encounters was the largest British exhibition of historical Polynesian material there has ever been, with some ten per cent of the objects on display being classifiable as weapons. It consequently offers a productive opportunity to evaluate critically the contemporary state of museological representation in relation to Polynesian weaponry. 186</page><page sequence="2">Polynesian Weapons Weaponry in Historical Polynesia Weapons were the most numerous class of Polynesian material culture collected during the early period of contact with Westerners (see, for example, Kaeppler 1978: 238, Ivory 2005: 85). This shows that they were ubiquitous in Polynesia in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and that they were alienable commodities, open to circulation. Western Polynesia and Central/Eastern Polynesia in particular constituted a complex economic and military sphere of interaction, and weaponry circulated between archipelagos within each region. There were a number of international weapon styles, and some core forms spanned large areas of the region, albeit with local variations in each place. Europeans rapidly exploited this pre- existing context of international arms trading, and introduced blades and firearms into the region from the late eighteenth century onwards. Consequently, the vast majority of museum accessions were collected from an already-hybrid military context involving artillery, muskets, axes, swords and knives, as well as traditional weapon forms. Weaponry permeated a wide range of cultural contexts in Polynesia, and performed a multitude of roles. The non-combative contexts of weapon use in historical Polynesia amounted to an equal or greater role than actual combat; so it would be an inaccurate representation to blankly view them as tools for killing. This polyvalence both generated and drew on their rich symbolic fertility; text and context mutually informed each other. Their symbolic fecundity grew from a root understanding of warriorship as embodying admirable personal qualities: the ability to protect one's social group, its members, and their lands; to overturn and usurp its rulers when they were weak, corrupt, or abusive; and to manifest one's own self- interest. These qualities amount to several of the principal indicators of mana - that core Polynesian concept of personally attained, but divinely sanctioned and bestowed efficacy. Mana is best viewed concurrently as an attributable quality and a metaphysical substance. Mana was directly linked to sexual potency and gender- role congruence in Polynesia, as well as to achieved high status. In order to understand weaponry, therefore, we must constantly bear in mind this profound covariance of warriorship, high status, masculinity, and metaphysical efficacy (see, for example, Sahlins 1985: 78ff., Marcus 1989, Shore 1989, Reilly 2001). Such associations with efficacy directly impacted on the culture of (particularly elite) male dress and adornment throughout Polynesia, where weapons were commonly worn. Clubs in particular were a central component of the material- culture complex of male Polynesian dress.2 The use of weaponry parallels that of other hand-held objects, such as fly-whisks and staffs, used to indicate status and give emphasis to oratory; the weapon performatively embodied the bearer's admirable warrior qualities, which in turn reflected his social status, social agency, and mana. Throughout the region, efficacious weapons acquired personal names. Although the weapon's personal identity was a distinct and supernaturally valid one, the 187</page><page sequence="3">Andy Mills cultural biographies of warrior and weapon were entirely fused during the period of ownership. Moreover, each continued to possess associations with the other long after the two had parted company. Historical Polynesians understood mana to pass epidemiological^ between objects and their users. The implication of this biographical mingling of supernatural efficacy, in conjunction with the veneration and invocation of ancestors, was the widespread use of weapons in ritual contexts (see, for example, Gifford 1929: 317-27, Clunie 1977: chapter 10, Rose 1978: 7, Claessen 1995: 285, Kaeppler 1999: 24-30, Kjellgren 2001: 75, Kjellgren 2005: 9-10, Ivory 2005). For example, in Western Polynesia, weapons were often kept in the temple and employed as the vaka (manifestation vehicle) of an ancestral warrior's spirit, or as spirits on their own account. More often, a possession priest (taula in Tongan, bete in Fijian) served the function of vaka for the spirit, but again, we read of weapons used as a conduit by which the deity left the priest's body and returned to the divine world (Lawry 1851: 38, Williams 1858: 224-5). Weapons were also carried by individual warriors in diplomatic rituals, such as the Maori wero, or challenge, to metonymically symbolize the social group's power to wage war, but offer peace (Mead 2003). Throughout the region, weapons consequently instantiated complex metaphysical forces and supernatural persons; as a result, anything other than a stringent attitude of respect towards them would be ill advised. Elaborate mock battles also occurred in historical Polynesia as pivotal scenes of annual state ritual. The Inasi ceremony in Tonga and the Makahiki ceremony in Hawai' i were both calendrical ritual crises in which agricultural fecundity, the pre-eminence of the state deity, and the political legitimacy of the incumbent paramount chief converged, were ritually suspended, and reasserted anew (see Cook in Beaglehole (ed.) 1967: 145-55, Sahlins 1985, Valeri 1985). In addition to these most serious cultural roles of weaponry, many martially themed games existed throughout the region, which developed and honed the skills needed in wrestling, boxing, club-fencing, spear- throwing, archery, and dodging, in boys and grown men alike. Furthermore, forms of male-gendered dance were to be found in nearly every Polynesian society, where weapons (either practical tools, or others especially modified for use in dance) were presented, twirled, thrown, and generally wielded performatively. In all these occurrences, the weapon can be seen as manifesting socioculturally the man's mana through its close reconciliation with warrior qualities. Polynesian Weapons and Museum Representation The development of a thorough Polynesian art history has been hampered from the outset by a lack of provenance information, and by fragmentary collection. Recent works on style and manufacturing process have done much to remedy this (see, for example, Mead 1969, Neich 2001), but the basic foundation for a full appraisal of Polynesian weapons as artworks is still lacking. As an indispensable precondition of 188</page><page sequence="4">Polynesian Weapons such a project, I would suggest that we must consider each weapon form as encoding its own complex art-historical trajectory. We unquestioningly apply this kind of thinking to metallic European or Asian weapons, but not to carved Polynesian weapons. Historically, anthropological material culture studies have lacked the interpretive methods and terminology developed in archaeology and art history; it seems that where the great classification enterprises of the period before the Second World War left off, few formal analyses of comparable rigour or scope have taken their place, built on their work, or revised their misconceptions. Self-Representation Personal aesthetic and ethical evaluations of weaponry are politicized, and historically and culturally specific. We presently live in a period in which, in the West at least, the warrior is, unprecedentedly, a negatively evaluated archetype (Bly 1990: 146ff.). In recent years, the majority of Westerners have experienced war as a distant phenomenon, impacting more on economics than survival. Consequently, the validity of the warrior role has become easily questioned. Such an evaluation of warfare inevitably percolates into understandings of its material culture. Weapons are the most numerous and widely distributed class of Polynesian material culture within British museum collections, which directly expresses the consumer demand for non- Western weapons that existed among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European collectors and curators (see, for example, Sargeaunt 1908, Gathercole and Clarke 1979, Spring 1993, Taylor 2001, Waterfield and King 2006). In many ways, non- Western artefacts have served the historical role of material consumables in the Western construction of self-representations. From their earliest manifestation in the 'cabinets of curiosity' of Enlightenment gentlemen, the display and apprehension of objects have been self-referential acts of identity formation, reflecting the possession of travel experience and knowledge as Modern European cultural commodities. The inevitable result has been ethnocentric museological representation, fundamentally based on the deployment of the material evidence of the command of otherness. Consuming Savagery To furnish a sense of otherness, Europeans have historically conceptualized Polynesians through a small number of starkly polarized representations - by turns positive and negative, and yet always inaccurate and reductive. With specific reference to weaponry, the dominant theme has been an unfavourable, exoticizing contrast with Western culture, rather than the discussion of rather similar solutions to the universal human problem of violent conflict. Weaponry has occupied a central position in the self-referential representation of otherness, as it constitutes the 189</page><page sequence="5">Andy Mills material point of convergence for several powerful discourses, particularly exoticism and what Bernard Smith called 'ignoble savagery' (see Smith 1985: 317ff.; see also Hall 1997, Lidchi 1997). As European navigators, whalers, sandalwood traders, and missionaries came to observe Polynesian warfare first- hand, a range of military practices fitted seamlessly into their pre-existing framework of ignoble savagery: notably, cannibalism, mutilation of the enemy dead, head-taking, and the consultation and reverencing of non-Christian deities. Little effort was invested in attempting to understand the complex cultural motivations behind such practices. As my opening quotation from Moby Dick suggests, the weapons of Polynesia have been viewed through this lens, and their forms themselves seen to manifest the cruelty and savagery of their makers. Emerging from the savagery notionally embodied in these weapons, their museological display can be seen as an act of demonstrable contact with such savagery, making them material trophies of an intellectual and moral encompassment. As a specific deployment of the European discourse of savagery, the missionaries who entered Polynesia and began evangelizing from the 1790s narrated traditional wooden and stone weapons as evidence of the barbarity of the unsaved heathen. The use of weapons as ancestral instantiations and god vessels also led missionaries to condemn them. Running parallel with this condemnation, there was a considerable awareness among the missions of the market value of Polynesian material culture. For both reasons, they collected weapons in vast quantities, both to display in the West as trophies and exemplars of savagery, and to sell at auction in order to fund further missionary activities (see, for example, Thomas 1991: 151-62, Gardner 2000, Hooper 2006: 62-6). Typological Evolutionism Underlying the moral superiority that Westerners derived from the forms of weapons themselves, there was a core sense of technological superiority, emerging most tellingly in the sphere of classification. From the early nineteenth century, when the Danish curator Christian Jürgensen Thomsen proposed the linear archaeological system of stone, bronze, and iron ages, social and technological evolutionism grew together into a single discourse, and heavily informed the way in which Westerners classified the material culture of historical and ethnographic groups. Most museologists are familiar with the late nineteenth-century typological evolutionism of General A. H. L. F. Pitt-Rivers, but it is significant that weaponry represented a huge proportion of his collection, and that many of his most influential ideas were developed through the analysis of weaponry (see Lane Fox [Pitt-Rivers] 1875). His diffusionist/evolutionist theories hierarchized weapon types on the basis of various formal and functional criteria; the selection of these criteria was subjective, etic, and founded on little or no personal experience of use. 190</page><page sequence="6">Polynesian Weapons Consequently, their value was minimal. Such technological hierarchies seamlessly collapse difference from modern Europe in ethnicity, technology, time, and space into a single dimension. One of the defining ecological characteristics of Polynesia is its relative scarcity of material resources, and the Polynesian arts consequently developed within the constraints of that scarcity. Historical Polynesia had a non- metallic technology, and its people were consequently conceived as stone age primitives (see Shanks and Tilley 1987: 155ff.). Classificatory Panopticism Pitt-Rivers 's typological manner of presenting weaponry was echoed in the later displays of Baron Anatole von Hügel at, what is now, the University of Cambridge's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, and (under von Hügel's influence) at the Royal United Services Institute Museum in Whitehall, London. Crucially, however, these representations were devoid of the evolutionist gloss. The classification of weaponry came to serve as an end in itself, although the aesthetic qualities of such artefact compositions are also important, and often ignored. The synoptic exhibition of such Edwardian displays, attempting total geographical and typological coverage of the populated world, amounted to the museological equivalent of a Benthamite Panopticon; one could stand in the heart of such a gallery, turn one's head through 360 degrees, and encompass the world, materially, in a glance. Polynesian weapons became, like African masks, Native American ceramics, or Asian textiles, metaphorical butterflies or minerals to complete the classifier's sequence. As in the Panopticon, voyeuristic control and encompassment were the principal aims of these classificatory displays (see Foucault 1977). Synoptic exhibition came to dominate the way Polynesian material culture was displayed throughout the remainder of the twentieth century. Politicized Terminology The terminology of classification is another form of representational bias that manifests very clearly in the representation of Polynesian weapon types. In particular, I would highlight the use of the words club and spear to reductively encompass several hundred distinct artefact forms. When we write about similar European weapons, we use words such as mace, morning star, flail, war-hammer, stave, quarterstaff, shillelagh, truncheon, javelin, pike, and lance. We use these terms to evoke specific historical and cultural contexts, which are often somewhat romanticized. Equally, all Polynesian weapon forms possess specific names in the languages of their source communities (often considered beautiful on the ear), which are not conventionally used in Western scholarship. Using the word 'club' eliminates cultural, historical, and technological uniqueness, which makes the 191</page><page sequence="7">Andy Mills culturally complex representationally simple; we leave a vacuum of signification, which the visitor fills with their prior knowledge of what such nouns signify. The result is the activation of previously internalized cultural discourses. The blandness of the terms is itself a politicizing act, and constitutes the systematic devaluation of Polynesian weapons through false-neutral nomenclature. This is not just political correctness; with particular reference to Polynesia, we frequently encounter the curatorial use of terms such as spear-club and axe-club for various weapon forms, which are no more accurate than if one was to describe an English halberd as a spear-axe. Single and hyphenated English terms are inadequate to approximate historical Polynesian material-culture categories. We can suggest, therefore, that a compromise policy of using both indigenous terminology, and explanatory European terms, would achieve the aims of both accuracy and accessibility. From their earliest collection and display, therefore, Polynesian weapons have successively served as representational vehicles of several Eurocentric discourses. First, they served to index the Enlightenment gentleman's command of the exotic. Secondly, they were seen to embody the early Victorian missionary's representation of savagery in desperate need of Christian civilization. Thirdly, they were positioned within a late Victorian typological culture-historic model that sought to reify Western notions of cultural hierarchy, evolution, and technological supremacy. Fourthly, they were encompassed within an Edwardian project of total classification, as examples of cultural variability, of concern for its own aesthetic and encyclopaedic sake. At the core of each, encompassment and reduction have been the consistent themes. Post-War Marginalization In recent decades, the political landscape has shifted again. Curators seem to have allowed weaponry to fade into the background, and I would postulate three main reasons for that here: first, the sea-change in Western attitudes to warfare after the Second World War; secondly a post-colonial embarrassment at the racist and evolutionist representations fashioned in prior decades; and thirdly, an awkwardness emerging from confusion about how to disentangle the still-reverberating discourse of savagery from the historical facts of Polynesian warfare. Thus, Roger Duff's No Sort of Iron exhibition (see Duff (ed.) 1969) and Adrienne Kaeppler's 'Artificial Curiosities ' exhibition (see Kaeppler 1978) pursued a policy of synoptic display, in terms of geography and artistic media; both presented Cook-voyage material, which overwhelmingly comprises weaponry above any other class of artefact. The presence of weaponry in the exhibitions was relatively small, however, and its prominence in the Cook-voyage material little explored. 192</page><page sequence="8">Polynesian Weapons шшшшшяяшяшшяшшшшшшттттш^ .. - ^ Figure 1. View of the weapons case in the 'Land' zone in the Pacific Encounters exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. From a photograph taken by Andy Crouch in May 2006. Courtesy and copyright, Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts and Andy Crouch. Polynesian Weapons and Pacific Encounters I turn now to consider Pacific Encounters in light of the themes outlined above. To a certain degree, the exhibition comprised a mixture of widely recognized masterpieces and rarities, framed within an underlying drive towards the synoptic exhibition I have described above. Thus, there were one or two representative weapons for each nine geographical zones identified in the catalogue (Hooper 2006); Aotearoa / New Zealand and Western Polynesia broke this pattern, however, each being represented by several weapons, reflecting the high artistic elaboration of weapons in these two areas. Importantly, the exhibition itself generally shunned the typical geographic organization of previous synoptic exhibitions for a thematic organization into zones, which predominantly clustered artefacts typologically by function or form. Thus, there were recognizable areas within the exhibition containing anthropomorphic statuary, god images, gorget and breastplate forms, headrests and stools, and so on. The weaponry broadly paralleled this trend. The principal example of this was a very large wall-case in the 'Land' zone (circa eight metres by three by half a metre), which contained most of the larger spears and clubs (see Figure 1). Their massed parallel arrangement in rows and columns was reminiscent of the typological classifications of historical displays; 193</page><page sequence="9">Andy Mills however, whereas the Evolutionists had asserted relative value, and the Edwardians had presented formal diversity within discrete geographical zones, here we saw regional diversity presented without politicized evaluations. Consequently, one could identify the parallels and differences between the various forms, and gain a sense of lengthy art-historical process. An impression of regional diversity, artefact circulation, and historical complexity was further highlighted in this case by the attribution of certain weapon forms to two or more possible island groups, and we saw some staffs presented among these. This principal weapons case featured the following case text: Polynesians encountered each other not only as kin and neighbours but also as enemies, fighting over matters of honour and land, as is usual in human conflict. They later fought Europeans with their own weapons and increasingly with imported muskets. A wide range of local weapons was used, probably the greatest variety occurring in Aotearoa New Zealand, where short hand clubs, staff clubs and spears were used. Bifacial staff clubs were used virtually everywhere except Hawaii. Weapons were made and decorated not just to be effective in combat, but also to display status and to act as a type of portable god image - often having heads and faces which connected them to protective ancestral powers. A number of representational aims are clearly visible in this well-crafted piece of text; notably the desire to promote a sense of war having universal causes, although its forms and solutions were unique. The art-historical process, regional themes, and local specificity to be identified through the selection of artefacts is well paralleled by the case text, and the two form a cohesive representational whole. To further these representational ends, two unusual Fijian weapons were juxtaposed in another case in the 'Introduction' zone (Figure 2). First, a Fijian culacula club, surface-decorated in Fiji by a Maori carver during the mid-nineteenth century, attested to the mobility of Polynesian peoples and the permeability of their art styles. Displayed immediately above the culacula was a fine American musket from Fiji, the stock inlaid with segments of whale ivory by Tongan craftsmen around 1830. In this visually striking way, the exhibition highlighted the complex biographies of many Polynesian weapons, the central role of firearms in warfare of the collection period, and the dynamic processes of historical change often overlooked in museum displays (see Hooper 2006: 268-9; see also Appadurai 1986). Facing the large wall-case in the 'Land' zone, and spatially echoing Aotearoa / New Zealand's geographical remoteness from tropical Polynesia, a high, rectangular island-case contained four short Maori hand-clubs: a mere pounamu , a botiate , a patu onewa , and a wahaika. The case highlighted a range of materials in stone and wood, and the characteristic stylistic diversity of Maori weapon forms and decorative carving.3 Thus, in certain cases, geography was given precedence over regional affinity, when the aim was to emphasize local cultural complexity. Both the curatorial team's desire to allow the visitor to view as many of the objects as 194</page><page sequence="10">Polynesian Weapons Figure 2. Two of the weapons on display in the Pacific Encounters exhibition: above, an American / Fijian musket, loaned by the Marischal Museum, University of Aberdeen (ABDUA38487; see Hooper 2006: 268-9, cat. no. 266); below, a culacula club from Fiji, loaned by the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge (Z2970; see Hooper 2006: 269, cat. no. 267).

Consequently, the works' formal sophistication and refinement were permitted to come to the fore. Addressing the theme of multi-contextuality, a second large case in the 'Introduction' zone, glazed front and back, contained long weapons side-by-side with regalia staff forms. The Rapa Nui / Easter Island ua staff highlighted the point of convergence where the two roles blurred together.4 The massive defensive and sporting whalebone breastplate-shield from Tonga was placed in the 'Making Divine' zone among the adornment breastplates and gorgets, and again highlighted the diffuse cultural associations exhibited by weaponry.5 The anthropomorphic Marquesan 'и 'u club was placed among the god images in the same zone, alluding to the supernatural personification often exhibited by Polynesian weapons (Figure 3). Also in the 'Marae/Temple' zone was one of a small number of known spearhead god vessels from the Austral Islands in Central Polynesia.6 All these examples highlight that it is impossible to discern whether a weapon was the manifestation vehicle of a major ancestral god or a cultural treasure, on the basis of appearance alone. Consequently, I would advocate a cautious view that all Polynesian weapons are mana, and potentially sacred artefacts. This demands that we handle and discuss 195</page><page sequence="11">Andy Mills Figure 3. General view of the 'Making Divine 'zone in the Pacific Encounters exhibition. The 'u'u, bifacial club, from the Marquesas Islands, loaned by the British Museum (1920,3-17,1; see Hooper 2006: 163, cat. no. 11 7), is at the back right.

A baseline of appropriate respect and ritual protocol was one of the great strengths of Pacific Encounters, and laid a foundation for much of the positive feeling between participating source-community members and the Sainsbury Centre staff during the exhibition. In many ways, the exhibition can be seen to have built upon the policy of involving contemporary source communities, and the recognition of enduring mana, pioneered in the touring Te Maori exhibition of 1984-86 and the British Museum's Maori exhibition of 1988.7 It is clear that even though the curatorial team understood the close interrelationship between masculine mana, sexual potency, warriorship, and chiefly status embodied in Polynesian weapons, this relationship remained largely implicit in the exhibition itself. Consequently, prominent representational themes within the exhibition lacked a contextualizing ethno-historic anchor, from which they might , have derived benefit; for example, the link between male adornment and weaponry, the link between anthropomorphic weapons and god vessels, the link between chiefly legitimacy and regalia weapons, and so on. These themes were clearly present within the selection and organization of the artefacts (and in the catalogue, 196</page><page sequence="12">Polynesian Weapons to some extent), but did not reach expression through the exhibition texts themselves. This opportunity to characterize an engendered core tenet of historical Polynesian culture was narrowly missed. Representationally, the exhibition, and the catalogue in particular (Hooper 2006: 12-75 passim), were highly self-conscious, and went a significant way towards characterizing the earlier representational history of Polynesian art. The central role of the Christian missions in the Western world's consumption of Polynesia across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is becoming increasingly highlighted by historians of Oceania, and that this was a fundamental theme of Pacific Encounters marks its notable incorporation into museum representations (see, for example, Latukefu 1974, Gardner 2000, Jessop 2007). This in itself is a highly sensitive representational issue, requiring a measured approach, to avoid the denial of historical realities on one hand and the denigration of a major world religion (rather than social movements within it) on the other. Pacific Encounters took a measured, accurate, and respectful approach to this issue. Although culturally specific terms were often present in the exhibition catalogue, the case texts continued the dominant historical trend with regard to false-neutral nomenclature. There are clearly issues of visitor accessibility here, however, not least the problem of using terminology potentially viewed as opaque and exclusive. Due to the rarity of its exhibition, and the representational history outlined above, historical Polynesian material culture was inevitably going to seem exotic to the majority of the exhibition's British visitors. Little could have been done to avoid this, but the exhibition's focus on pre-Christian religious artefacts, lush items of adornment, and weaponry, perhaps heightened its exoticism. What is the alternative? Almost twenty years ago, Stephen Greenblatt (1981) argued that museological representations always fall somewhere on a continuum between the aim to engender resonance (i.e. a sense of affinity) in the visitor and the aim of engendering wonder. Evidently, a reductive sense of the exotic often emerges hand in hand with wonder, but the latter is also a basic predicate of artistic admiration, and ultimately, cross-cultural respect. Conclusion The polyvalent cultural context of Polynesian weapons was well represented by Pacific Encounters, although their close biographical commingling with individual men and lineages, and the profoundly gendered nature of their cultural symbolism, went largely unelucidated. The spiritual vibrancy of weapons was well expressed, and suitable ritual protocols applied to them in equal measure to that applied to the plethora of other sacred artefacts on display. I have argued strongly for the implementation of culturally specific terminology as a counterbalance to the reductive discursive impact of terms such as club and spear, although Pacific Encounters largely conformed to historical trend in this regard. I remarked that the 197</page><page sequence="13">Andy Mills mixture of pan-Polynesian and archipelago-specific displays, light on contextualizing text, promoted an appreciation of weapons as carvings, and a sense of regional art-historical process, as well as a sense of cultural diversity within island groups. The exhibition did an admirable job of exploding the European myths of historical inertia, solid cultural boundaries, and immobile populations, in a region often characterized in this way. The economic circulation of weaponry (including firearms) played a central role in this representation. However, again, the link between weaponry, masculinity, status, and metaphysical power was largely implicit, and so the driving force behind this gifting, trade, trophy-taking, and artistic embellishment, remained similarly obscured. To close, the exhibition can be characterized as politically self-conscious, art-historically respectful, and powerfully conveying of cultural complexity. To continue the development of these important themes in the future, I would argue that future exhibitors should add a more explicit genderization of the subject of weaponry, an explicit concern to contextualize its high cultural value in indigenous terms, and the application of culturally specific terminology wherever possible. Notes 1. During the preparations for the exhibition I was a doctoral student at the Sainsbury Research Unit writing about Tongan weapons (Mills 2007). Although not part of the curatorial team, I was peripherally involved with a number of aspects of the exhibition: writing a number of the texts for the educational resource area, giving a public talk about the weapons in the exhibition space, co-compiling the index of the exhibition catalogue, and serving as one of its proofreaders. 2.
