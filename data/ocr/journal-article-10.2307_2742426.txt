<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Guthrie's Theory of Religion by WILLIAM Y. ADAMS Department of Anthropology, University of Kentucky, Lexing- ton, Ky. 40506, U.S.A. 17 IX 80 Guthrie's (CA 21:181-203) neo-Tylorian approach provides welcome relief both from the sterile functionalism that has dominated anthropological studies of religion for the last three generations and from the simplistic recent formulations of some cultural ecologists (e.g., Harris 1979). I completely agree that the distinctions between "natural" and "supernatural" and between "sacred" and "profane" do not afford a viable basis for setting religion apart from the rest of human experience, since these are distinctions that many of the world's peoples do not make or recognize. This is a point that was well made by Evans-Pritchard (1965:44-45, 65) a few years ago; he went on to suggest that the sacred- profane dichotomy so dear to Durkheim and his followers may have been a reflection specifically of Durkheim's Hebraic background (p. 57). Guthrie could have cited, as further evidence of anthropo- morphism in religion, the persistent body symbolism found in religious architecture. The idea that the church, with its central nave and symmetrical flanking aisles, is a metaphor for the human body has been familiar for a very long time, but of course this kind of symmetry is by no means confined to Christian architecture. Indeed, archaeologists (albeit for the most part unconsciously) are so accustomed to it that they habitually interpret any monumental building that is bilateral- ly symmetrical as a religious structure and anything that is not symmetrical as a secular structure. Two good cases in point are the "temples" of the Indus Valley cities (cf. Wheeler 1968:52-53) and the "palaces" of Crete (Graham 1962). In neither case is there any direct evidence as to the function of these buildings, but those of the Indus Valley are symmetrical while those of Crete are not. (Douglas, who has explored the phenomenon of religious body symbolism in a number of works [e.g., 1966; 1973:93-112], does not seem to have given any attention to its architectural dimension.) While I am appreciative of Guthrie's general approach to the definition of religion, I am nevertheless convinced that anthro- pomorphism is, ultimately, a peripheral and not a central issue. In my own analysis I prefer to take as a point of departure the distinction between moral order and technical order made familiar to anthropologists through the work of Redfield (e.g., 1953:20-25). The technical order, broadly speaking, comprises those culturally learned and shared techniques--mostly ma- nipulative and exploitative--through which we deal with the inanimate things in our environment. The moral order comprises those cultural techniques--mostly reciprocal and always com- municative-through which we deal with the persons (and to some extent also the higher animals) in our environment. In addition to things and persons, however, all human groups also recognize the existence of a third factor in the environment: the unseen forces that activate things and persons to be what they are and to do as they do. All human groups have accordingly developed cultural strategies for dealing with those forces that they are able to recognize. Since forces are sensed rather than seen, however, it is never immediately obvious whether they belong in the category of things or of persons. I think most peoples recognize, and try to deal with, forces of both kinds. Here, in my view, is the very simple cutting edge that separates religion from science. Science belongs to the technical order and includes all cultural strategies for dealing with mechanical, will-less forces through essentially manipulative techniques. Religion belongs to the moral order and includes all strategies for dealing with willed or sentient forces through communicative techniques. My definition of religion therefore 84 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">hinges ultimately on a single concept: that of communication between man and the forces around (and within) him. Here I think lies the explanation for the persistent anthropo- morphism that Guthrie has correctly noted. As all of the visible and tangible entities with which we deal communicatively are either human or animal, it seems logical and inevitable that we should impute the same form to those unseen entities with which we also deal communicatively. Anthropomorphism thus is an effect and not a cause of the mental template with which we approach the unseen. I would like to conclude with the suggestion that in the study of religion, the continuing disputes between mentalism and materialism and between formalism and functionalism are both unproductive and unnecessary. In our approach to science we long ago found it useful to make a distinction between pure and applied science, and I believe that a similar distinction would be fruitful in the study of religion. We can then recognize that the Durkheimians, Freudians, and others have concerned themselves effectively, but also exclusively, with applied reli- gion, failing to recognize that the totality of its applications no more explains the full content of pure religion than the totality of applied science explains the full content of pure science. In both domains there are vast and intricate structures of cogni- tion that no test of "applicability" can explain; they are prod- ucts only of the mind's insatiable need to know and to explain.
