<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Nature of Things" and the Objective Import of Value Judgments Reflections on Herbert Schambeck's Iusnaturalist Conceptions BY ILMAR TAMMELO, SYDNEY In this review article I propose to consider some aspects of Herbert Schambeck's book on the concept of the nature of things1 and to articúlate some thoughts of my own about the meaning and role of the notion which the phrase "the nature of things" labels in the area of legal reasoning. This notion has played a prominent part in the history of legal ideas and has become a subject of world-wide discussion by legal philosophers. The phrase in question is also occasionally used by lawyers in connection with practical problems of law, who seem to employ it rather flippantly to convey that something is or ought to be the case because what is asserted is self-evident or otherwise reasonable to accept. The revival of contemporary interest in the notion of the nature of things is largely due to the stimulus of Gustav Radbruch, who — somewhat uneasy about the conceptions of law and justice which he had advocated as an exponent of legal-philosophical relativism — hoped that this notion would provide an expedient of reducing the harshness of the dualism of the Is (Sein) and the Ought (Sollen) and a way to qualify his own and other relativistic positions. In subséquent works by other authors, more ambitious attempts were made "to bridge the gulf between the Is and the Ought", to overcome positivism and relativism in legal thought, and to provide a foundation for a "concrete natural law" by recourse to the idea of the nature of things. Schambeck's présent book is one of the notable recent German monographie treatments2 of the problem because of its considerable informative value and intriguing thoughts calling for response by way of comment or challenge. 1 H.

Dreier, Zum Begriff der „Natur der Sache", Berlin 1965. 17*</page><page sequence="2">260 limai Tammelo After a survey of the vicissitudes of the idea of the nature of things in the history of philosophical and legal thought, Schambeck finds that there is a constant feature in the lawyers' quest for the nature of things, consisting in an effort to clarify "the possibility of gaining the knowledge of an ontic presupposition of positive law, the observance of which presupposition by the lawgiver renders legal relations . . . meaningful and efficacious"3. In other words, enacted norms as value judgments have an objective import; for they refer to known or know able facts which are significant for a proper understanding of legal provisions and for proper actualisation of law as a means of social control. In his analysis of the concept of the nature of things, Schambeck submits that "nature" in this context means "création itself in the widest sense". The meaning of "nature" (springing etymologically from "natura" and associated with "nasci": "to arise", "to bring forth") implies the origin of création and the order of création; both together imply the binding will of the creator "lending to everything that exists faculties of order (Ordnungskräfte)". As to the concept of "things" in the context in question, Schambeck points out that it is to be regarded as referring not only to things in the ordinary and normal sense of the word "thing" but also to persons4. Henee, it may be commented, the occurrence of this word in the phrase "the nature of things" is only an idiomatic accident: "the nature of entities" (or even "the nature of facts") would be a more appropriate expression. "The nature of things" thus conceived would cover also what is meant by "the nature of man", "the nature of social relations", or "the nature of law"; in short, it would mean everything which has an objective import for value judgments. Schambeck adopts the inspiring thought culled from Heraklitus that behind the visible world there is a hidden harmony instituted by the eternal logos5. He also thinks that man has the faculty to know this harmony and that man has the task "to act according to nature listening to it"6. This view implies that nature is conceived as a cryptogram of an Intelligent Being and that the deciphering of this cryptogram reveáis not only the laws according to which entities 3 Schambeck, op. cit., p. 32. 4 Ibid., p. 32—33. 5 Ib., 35, referring to A. Verdross, Abendländische Rechtsphilosophie, 1958 p. 11 and id., „Die Rechtslehre Heraklits", Zeitschrift für öffentliches Recht 22,1942, p. 498 ff. 6 Schambeck, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="3">The "Nataxe of Things" and the Objective Import 261 actually behave but also the laws according to which men ought to behave. Consistently with this conception, Schambeck contends that "the regularity which is knowable from nature has its specific (eigenen) ground of validity in the will of the Cieatof1. Accordingly, the "nature of things" is an idea which relates to "an ontic as well as a deontic State of affairs" 8. This idea, containing "not merely the concept of nature in the sense of the corporeal world but also the essentiality [Wesenhaftigkeit) of Being immanent in law", présupposés "a concrete thought-object which must relate to what is essential". In order to apprehend not only "phénoménal forms of Being" but also "the essentia which is anterior to law", the person striving for knowledge "must refrain from his personal opportunistic wishes" and be only a cogniser9. From the expressions quoted above it appears that the essence of which Schambeck speaks in connection with the nature of things is what is axiotically essential (i. e. important, significant). So he also says that the nature of things is "an axiotic point of reference (Wert bezugspunkt) for ail other qualities". Thus, for example, "dignitas humana" is a unitary value which puts an imprint of a person on a man; it is reflected "in various rights of man called 'fundamental rights' in constitutions"10. Viewing "the nature of things" as "an expression of a prépositive order" which "is founded in création", Schambeck finds that it has an absolute value; it "points out ontological connections subsisting independently of the will of the legislator and requiring that they be observed by him" u. It is "not an expression of conation of values but rather of Cognition of values; it is founded in Being and is an objective fact"12. The value that appertains to the nature of things must not be placed into reality or interpreted into it. This value is "already présent in the essential Being"ls. Professor Schambeck's conception of the nature of things is centered around the notion of "essential" Being and around the idea of the good order of création instituted by a good and wise creator. Such a conception entails anthropomorphism and it can be sustained only by espousing an elabórate doctrine of theodizee, which may be immediately acceptable to many, but produces qualms in many others. It is trite that the world seems wonderful to one who happens to be in an elative mood, but woeful to one who happens to be in a depressive mood. When one is in a serene frame of mind one is likely to find that 7 Schambeck, op. cit., p. 36. 8 Ibid., p. 63. 0 h 10 Ib., p. 57. 11 Ib., p. 67. 12 Ib., p. 73. 13 lb„ p. 72</page><page sequence="4">262 limai Tammelo there is much undeserved suffering in the world and that man often proves to be a wolf to another man and a beast to other beings capable of experiencing misery. Weltanschauungen entertained in oblivion in sombre aspects of reality are liable to encounter intellectual uneasiness and are exposed even to the charge of obtúrate piety. They can plaus ibly be challenged by the contention that création has essential flaws, and, if an Intelligent Being has created the world, this creator has been a bungler or a démon rather than an entity endowed with ail attributes of perfection. To break the spear of such irreverence requires considerable ingenuity and intellectual effort which is awkward to display in the contexts of discussion of legal-philosophical problems. A simple way of dealing with the difficulties which here emerge is to reason about matters relating to the nature of things in "bracketing out" the values which may be immanent or intrinsic in the world confronting man — in abstraction of any postulated cosmic good order. Approaching the problems of the présent concern in this manner, the task of man appears to be not just to act according to nature perceiving it but to enhance the goodness of the order that may be deemed to exist in the world of human concern by pro-ceiving and pro-acting with respect to nature and to continue the process of création bygiving this process a direction and character which man's intelligence, insight, and compassion may reveal. In this enterprise the idea of the nature of things opérâtes as an expédient of thought calling to the awareness of homo fabei the résistance of the materials to be shaped to his needs, the obtuseness of instruments at his disposai, and the limitations of his powers to achieve many ardently desired and supremely désirable ends. For those whose eyes are not too starry, the so called human dignity is liable to appear not so much a factum as a facendum. In the face of human indignity in uncountable instances of man's indifférence, folly, and cruelty, dignitas humana can scarcely count as a constitutive idea of humanitas,- it rather opérâtes as a regulative idea for human effort to create conditions of individual and social life which would render it more humane than it happens to be. In the historical vicissitudes of the idea of the nature of things, this idea has become an overworked and vague notion. The primary scholarly task is to demythologise it and to reconstruct it rationally without having recourse to metaphors and other tropes. An essential distinction to be made within the general concept which may be labelled as "the nature of entities" is the nature of man as a knowing,</page><page sequence="5">The "Nature of Things" and the Objective Import 263 feeling, and Willing entity and the nature of what confronts man as such an entity — "the nature of things" (in the narrow sense of the word "things"). In the realm of law there is a significant interplay between the knowledge which man obtains of the reality confronting him and his appraisal of this reality. This interplay is determined by man's abiding characteristics, that is, his nature and by the character istics of the objects with which he deals, that is, their nature. As from Hume and Kant, it is no longer safe to say that value judgments may be derived from descriptive Statements about entities. However, no descriptive fallacy is involved if these judgments are formed or justified having regard to objects of évaluation. For the qualities of the latter correspond or fail to correspond to man's needs, desires, expectations, preferences, etc. and this is relevant to the endowment of positive or negative values to the required, desired, etc. objects. Thus value-endowed entities are constituted which are apprehended not only in their pure factuality but also in the tertiary qualities attributed to them as a resuit of human concern and entanglement with the world. Since human life and its various incidents dépend on that the world is in actual fact, man's evaluative attitudes and conative acts reflect this dependence by their in-tentionality: by their reference to relevant objects, and thus have an objective import. In order to arrive at well founded judgments about what he finds in the world confronting him, man must strive also for an adéquate knowledge and for an adéquate appraisal of himelf. Thus his own seif becomes an in-tentional object of his cognitive, emotive, and conative acts. When evaluating himself in self-objectivisation, he passes value judgments which have an objective import in their reference to his constitution, to his "essential nature". By this nature, man is an entity who does not only live but is capable of conducting his life, of overhauling himself, of transforming himself, of surpassing himself. However limited this capacity may be in actual fact, it is potentially there as an "essential" human capacity and thus forms a basis for a specific virtue of man which may well be regarded as the substratum of the regulative idea called "human dignity". The above reaction to Herbert Schambeck's iusnaturalist con ceptions is somewhat at odds with traditional and current ideas of natural law; it does not, however, in volve rejection of the idea of natural law altogether. Natural law is conceivable and defensible as a body of thought in the same way as natural religion and natural moráis have heen conceived and defended, that is, not as a body of</page><page sequence="6">264 limai Tammelo ideas derived fïom any actual or putative law-making authority but from the authority of reason manifesting itself through argumentation in which the relevant rules guiding free, composed, and sincere inquiry are respected. This inquiry cannot Start from a Scratch: there is no "absolute" beginning of either for science and philosophy or for moráis. The quest for verum and bonum starts from the situation in which the inquirer is placed. In his cultural inheritance and environment he finds a host of regulative ideas which he has to sift and to sort out. Among them he finds principies whose tenability appears to him beyond reasonable doubt and which he ought to respect until he can produce "good reasons" for their réfutation or modification. The commonly accepted (but nevertheless defeasible) standards of scholarly behaviour in research and argumentation are the most solid ground available for any natural law thought14. What emerge from an inquiry conducted according to these standards as insights, widely shared by enlightened men of the given epoch, into what law ought to be can aptly be called "natural law principies". It would be an unwarranted immodesty to claim that these principies are eternal, though some of them may prove to be transepochal. For the aspiration to achieve excellence of law, this restrained view of the nature of things and the nature of man is quite sufficient. The epistemologicalscepticism which it involves leaves intact the ontological states of affairs in their noumenal being. In suspending his judgment about the ultimate nature of création, the legal scholar solicitous about good law rids himself from a heieditas onerosa which maltes the performance of his tasks as a servant or as a master of law more arduous and hazardous than it needs to be. 14 It may be noted that the commonly accepted standards of scholarly behaviour can also be viewed as a body of natural law norms (and not as mere presuppositions of natural law thought) because they can be conceived as principies stipulating duties and rights pertinent to an important area of human relations.</page><page sequence="7">The "Nature of Things" and the Objective Import 265 ILMAR TAMMELO The "Nature of Things" and the Objective Import of Value fudgments Summary This article examines Herbert Schambeck's concept of the nature of things centered around the notion of the "essential" Being and around the idea of the good order of création instituted by a good and wise creator. The author criticizes these basic reflections and holds the reality of the world to be compatible with the assumption of a bad order of création or, at least, one with essential defects. The author is sceptic about the possible knowledge of the metaphysical foundations of law and justice and thinks that a lack of knowledge of the nature of création does not run contrary to the striving after the good or the right law. The author does not fully reject the idea of natural law but thinks a natural law which is not maintained as absolute to be conceivable and defensible. He holds this natural law as a body of norms to be derived from the authority of reason manifesting itself through argumentation in which the relevant rules guiding free, composed, and sincere inquiry are respected. The quest for verum and bonum Starts from the situation in which the inquirer is placed. In his cultural inheritance and environ ment he finds a host of regulative ideas which he has to sift and to sort out. The commonly accepted standards of scholarly behaviour in re search and argumentation are the most solid foundation available for any natural law thought. Although natural law conceived in this way can not claim to be absolute, some of its foundations can still prove to be transepochal. ILMAR TAMMELO La „nature des choses" et la signification objective des jugements de valeur Résumé Cet article examine le concept de la nature des choses représenté par M. Herbert Schambeck fondé sur la notion de l'Etre essentiel et sur l'idée du bon ordre de la création. L'auteur critique ce concept et croit que les réalités du monde admettent aussi la conception selon laquelle</page><page sequence="8">266 limar Tammelo cet ordre est mauvais ou a des défections sérieuses. Il est sceptique face à la possibilité de connaître les fondations métaphisiques du droit et de la justice et trouve qu'un manque de connaissances sur l'essence de la création ne contrecarre pas les efforts en vue d'achever le droit juste. L'auteur ne rejette pas complètement l'idée du droit naturel, mais croit qu'un droit naturel sans être absolu est concevable et défendable comme un ensemble de normes dont l'autorité est basée sur la raison. Celle-ci se manifeste par l'argumentation dans laquelle les règles qui guident la recherche libre tranquille et sérieuse sont respectées. Les standards du travail scientifique qui sont généralement reconnus (mais qui néanmoins ne sont pas inattaquables) constituent la fondation la plus solide de la pensée du droit naturel. Ces standards peuvent être interprêtés comme normes du droit naturel, puisqu' ils stipulent des droits et des devoirs applicables dans un domaine important des rela tions humaines. Bien que le droit naturel ainsi connu ne peut être considéré comme absolu, pourtant maints de ces principes peuvent être ceux d'une époque de transition. ILMAR TAMMELO Die „Natur der Sache" und die objektive Bedeutung der Werturteile Zusammenfassung Dieser Artikel untersucht Herbert Schambecks Begriff der Natur der Sache, dessen Grundgedanken die Vorstellung des „wesentlichen" Seins und die Idee der guten Schöpfungsordnung sind. Der Verfasser kritisiert diese Grundgedanken und meint, daß die Wirklichkeit der Welt auch mit der Auffassung vereinbar ist, nach der die Schöpfungsordnung schlecht oder wenigstens mit wesentlichen Mängeln behaftet ist. Er verhält sich skeptisch zur Erkennbarkeit der metaphysischen Grund lagen des Rechts und der Gerechtigkeit und findet, daß ein Verzicht auf die Erkenntnis der Natur der Schöpfung nicht daran hindert, das gute oder das richtige Recht zu erstreben. Der Verfasser lehnt die Idee des Naturrechts nicht völlig ab, sondern hält ein Naturrecht, das nicht als absolut behauptet wird, für denkbar und vertretbar. Dieses Naturrecht wird von ihm als ein Normenkom plex aufgefaßt, dessen Autorität auf der Autorität der Vernunft beruht, die sich in der Argumentation entfaltet, in der die Regeln beachtet wer</page><page sequence="9">The "Nature of Things" and the Objective Import 267 den, die eine freie, gelassene und aufrichtige Untersuchung leiten.
