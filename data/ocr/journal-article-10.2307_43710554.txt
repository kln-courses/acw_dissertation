<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Hebrew Union College Annual, XXVIII (Cincinnati, 1957). Pp. 324 26. The HUCA of 1957, now published with a subvention from the Neumann Publication Fund, contains the following fifteen articles. 1. Julius Lewy, "Origin and Significance of the Biblical Term 'Hebrew/ " 1-13. Pointing to the fact that the OT never uses the term "Hebrew" to desig- nate the language of the ancient Israelites, L. argues that this term "was an appellative noun to be rendered by 'alien' " and not "an ethnical name ipso facto denoting the Israelites." Its modern use as an ethnical term arose in the last pre-Christian centuries (cf. 2 Mc 7,31; 11,13; 15,37 where "Hebrews" is synonymous with "Jews") because the people who looked upon Abraham as their ancestor wrongly concluded that, if he was called 9 abrām hã ' ibrî in Gn 14,13, they too could call themselves hã ' ibrim ; the Greek translator, aware of this misunderstanding, intentionally avoided his usual rendering of ' ibrî by ' Ebraios and deliberately translated the word in the LXX of this passage by (o peratēs, "the one who has come across," the immigrant. L. accepts this translation as correct: the term 'ibrî has the same meaning and refers to the same social class as the Akkadian ha-bi-ru and the Egyptian and Ugaritic ' ap/biru ; the latter term does not represent an Akkadian * ' apiru , "one provided with food" (so Goetze), but is a loanword from West Semitic 'ãbiru (active participle), "he who crosses over"; 'ibrî, however, a different form from the same root, is an appellative with the adjectival ending -î from a noun *'ibr, "the other side, the land beyond." 2. Julian Morgenstern, "Jerusalem - 485 b.c. ( continued ). X. The Judaean King," 15-47. We know practically nothing of the happenings in Juda during the first half of the fifth century b.c. In this article M. offers to fill the gap. At the accession of Xerxes in 486 Juda had a king who rebelled against the Persians and brought on Jerusalem in 485 the terrible catastrophe described so vividly in Lam. From Lam we even know the name of this king: it is Mena- hem, for here Jerusalem laments that she no longer has a menahēm, "reassurer." This, however, is merely his throne name; he probably was Meshullam, the oldest son of Zerubabel. In fact, there are dozens of passages in the Prophets and in the Psalms which only make sense (to M.) if understood in the light of this dark period. Thus, Mai 2,10-16 is an oracle against this king of Juda for divorcing his Jewish wife in order to marry the daughter of the king of Tyre. Ps 45 is the epithalamium composed for the occasion. In this political deal, sealed by a marriage, Juda would take the port of Aqaba from Edom and divert the trade from Damascus (via Moab and Ammon) to Tyre (via Juda). But the wedding was called off. Tyre double-crossed Juda and sided with Edom &amp; Co. when Persia cracked down on Jerusalem in 485. All this is quite as exciting as a science-fiction novel, and quite as fantastic. Besides, it is a serial : it began in a previous issue and will be continued in the next issue. 3. Reuven Yaron, "Two Greek Words in the Brooklyn Museum Aramaic 380</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 381 Papyri," 49-51. In Brklyn. Pap. 9, line 3, a man who donates a piece of prop- erty to his daughter says, yhbth Iky drymyy , which E. Kraeling renders as "I have given it to thee as my drymy" Y. suggests that this is the Greek word dõrêma, "gift." This may be right, although the final y would be hard to account for. In Brklyn. Pap. 12, where mention is made in line 14 of ksp ywn bmnyn sttry 6, "money of Yawan [Greece] in number of staters 6," a certain woman is called pdypt zy mslm, "the pdypt of Meshullam." Y. argues from the expression in the Palestinian Talmud (Baba Bathra, VII, 16b: a 3d cent. a.D. passage), qqw-pdypty •=. Greek kako-paideutoi, "badly brought up, ill- bred," that the phrase in this papyrus means "foster daughter of M." These two papyri are dated respectively in 404 and 402 b.c. If these words are cor- rectly explained by Y., it is truly remarkable that Greek words occurred at such an early date in the Aramaic of southern Egypt. 4. Harry M. Orlinsky, "Studies in the Septuagint of the Book of Job; Chapter I : an Analytical Survey of Previous Studies," 53-74. After setting forth the state of the case, that the LXX offers a text of Jb that is considerably different from that in the MT, since it has not only many variant readings, but in general a much shorter text, yet with some extra verses of its own, O. re- views the previous studies on the text of Jb - by Bickell, Merx, Hatch, Kloster- mann, Gray, Buttenwieser, Beer, Gerleman et al. - and finds them all unsatis- factory. O.'s own theory is left for the next issue of the HUCA. Meanwhile the reviewer would suggest that, while the still unpublished fragments of Jb from Qumrân Cave IV may not be extensive enough to throw much light on the question, there may well have been in Qumrân times a Hebrew recension of Jb similar to that of the LXX, if one may judge from the Qumrân evidence for the textual history of Jer. The publication of the "lost Targum" of Jb from Qumrân Cave XI may also prove useful in this matter. 5. Marshall S. Hurwitz, "The Septuagint of Isaiah 36-39 in Relation to that of 1-35, 40-66," 75-83. The author's conclusions to this detailed study are : "1. The treatment of the few anthropomorphisms available for study in the LXX of Isa 36-39 is different from that of the rest of the Book. Specifically, throughout the LXX of Isa anthropomorphic terms in the Hebrew are trans- lated literally, while in 36-39 they are paraphrased, telescoped, or replaced by prepositions not used elsewhere in the Book for the same terms. 2. At several significant points the choice of language in the LXX of Isa 36-39 is different from the choice of language found in the rest of the Book. ... 3. These differ- ences may be explained by another translator's hand at work. . . ." 6. Arthur Soff er, "The Treatment of Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopath- isms in the Septuagint of Psalms," 85-107. This is another detailed examination of the LXX, from which the author draws the following conclusions: "1. Although there may be an exegetical pattern in the LXX translation of Psalms, it would seem that anti-anthropomorphism and anti-anthropopathism played no part in that pattern. ... 2. It would also appear that the LXX of Psalms is the work of a single translator. ... 3. The differences between MT</page><page sequence="3">382 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 20 and LXX are not always the result of deliberate mistranslation or mistaken in- terpretation ; in some instances they are due to differences between MT and the translator's Vorlage " This article and the preceding one are dissertations for the master's degree by students of Prof. Orlinsky and are excellent speci- mens of this type of research. 7. Ernst Bammel, "Der Achtundzwanzigste Adar," 109-113. One of the memorial days listed in the Megillat Ta'anît (the "Scroll of Fasting," though it contains feastdays as well as fastdays) is the 28th of Adar, in commemoration of the repeal of legislation hostile to the Jewish religion. Scholars have fixed the origin of this feast at various dates from Machabean times (cf. 2 Mc 11,22-33) to the times of Hadrian and even of the Antonines. B. argues for 31 A.D. immediately after the death of Sej anus. The scholion in the Scroll says that the repeal was obtained by a matronít (Lat. matrona) who had all the great men of Rome on her side. B. identifies this woman with Antonia, Ti- berius's sister-in-law, who was leader of a coterie that was well-inclined toward the Jews. B. promises to treat later of the bearing of these events on the trial of Jesus. 8. Alexander Guttmann, "Hillelites and Shammaites - a Clarification," 115- 126. G. is opposed to the "tendency to classify certain leading Tannaim as Hillelites and Shammaites," since "these respective schools no longer existed after the destruction of the Second Temple." According to G., the term shammuti, which is applied to Rabbi Eliezer in the Babylonian Talmud, means "put under the ban"; the Palestinian Talmud mistook it to mean Shammati, "a Shammaite." 9. Jakob J. Petuchowski, "The Controversial Figure of Melchizedek," 127- 136. In the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Nedarim 32b, Rabbi Ishmael of the early second century is quoted as speaking in rather derogatory terms of the priesthood of Melchisedec. This has been explained by some scholars as a polemic against the Christian interpretation of Gn 14,18ff and Ps 109 (110), 4 that is given in Heb 7. But P. sees in it rather a polemic against the Hasmonean priest-kings, who sought to legitimize their priesthood by appealing to these passages in Gn and Ps. Yet the few references that P. makes to 1 Mc and the Jewish Apocryphals hardly prove that the Hasmoneans had recourse to this Psalm to support their claim to the priesthood. The sectarians of Qumrân, who were the most bitter opponents of the new line of priests in Jerusalem did not, as far as the reviewer is aware, use such polemics against them. Besides, at the time of Rabbi Ishmael the question of the Hasmonean priesthood had long since ceased to be a live issue. 10. John Briggs Curtis, "An Investigation of the Mount of Olives in the Judaeo-Christian Tradition," 137-180. The OT has certain passages (3 Kgs 11,7; 23,13) which clearly connect the Mount of Olives with the worship of Chamos ( Kemos ) and Moloch ( Mõlek ) or Melchom ( Milkõm ). C. is also in- clined to see a reference to this pagan worship in other more or less innocent- looking passages (e.g. 2 Sm 15,30.32; Neh 8,15; Ez 11,23). He identifies</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 383 Chamos with Moloch and then, following Jensen, equates this double-named deity with Nergal, the Mesopotamian god of the nether world. Since Nergal is essentially a god of death and destruction, C. takes the term hœr-hammasqît in 4 Kgs 23,13, not in the traditional sense of "mount of corruption" (Vg mons offensionis ), but as meaning "mount of the destroyer," the latter being Nergal, the god of destruction; cf. also Jer 51,25. Other allusions to this "Destroyer" are seen in Ex 12,23 and 2 Sm 24,16. The splitting of the Mount of Olives in Za 14,4 is supposed to be the opening of a passage to the nether world, the realm of Nergal, by means of which the ghosts of the dead can come back on earth. Reference to Moloch, in the form of Mãlik, as jail-keeper of Hell, is found in the Qur'ân (Sura 43:74-77). This leads C. to see a similar allusion in Heb 2, 14f ; 1 Pt 3,18ff; Jude 9. Even the accidental presence of Jesus on the Mount of Olives at certain occasions (Mk 13,3; 14,26; Lk 19,29; 24,50) has, for C., overtones reminiscent of the Nergal worship on this site. One may rightly object that this is surely going a bit too far. However, in all fairness it must be admitted that C. modestly offers some of these ideas as mere possi- bilities; he has indeed collected (pp. 151-167) a large amount of material on Nergal which, apart from the author's speculations, has definite value in itself. 11. Franz Lansberger, "The Sacred Direction in Synagogue and Church," 181-203. The ancients were more conscious of a sacred direction at prayer than we moderns are. But the evidence which L. has collected in this article shows that at different times different principles were at play in determining the sacred direction. The oldest synagogues had portals and windows opening toward Jerusalem, and the worshipper faced these when at prayer. At that time the Torah chest was portable and was brought in and placed near the portal when the community assembled for services. Later synagogues were so built that the side toward Jerusalem had a solid wall, in which was a niche for the portable Torah chest and afterwards for the permanently fixed Torah ark. The congregation still faced Jerusalem. The portal might be at the opposite end, but more often in Palestine it was at the eastern end. This was in keeping with a prescription of the Tosefta (Meg. IV, 22) : the Tent of Meeting was thought to have its entrance toward the east (cf. Nm 2,2f), as the Temple of Jerusalem certainly did (Ez 43,1-4). In ancient Christian churches the worshipper almost always prayed toward the east. In the oldest churches (as in Rome) the portal was at the eastern end; in these churches, according to L., the altar was at first wooden and portable, so that it could be placed near the portal. Later, when the altar was made of stone and permanently fixed, the portal was placed at the western end and the altar at the eastern end of the church. The development here may, in some ways, be parallel to that of the change in orientation of the synagogue, but even L. admits that there was no direct influence of the one on the other. His statement, however, that "it was surely out of the Torah niche [of the synagogue] that there developed the apse" of the Christian church is not correct. The apse was already in the pre-Christian basilica when it was a Roman courthouse.</page><page sequence="5">384 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 20 12. Raphael Loewe, "The Mediaeval Christian Hebraists of England," 205- 252. A long and very learned article containing an excellent study of the Latin-Hebrew Psalters used by a surprisingly large number of Catholic scholars in mediaeval England. Most of these bi-lingual Psalters were of Norman provenance and show certain Rabbinical influence. 13. Samuel Atlas, "Solomon Maimon's Philosophy of Language Critically Examined," 253-288. A keen analysis of the epistemology and metaphysics of Solomon Maimon (1754-1800), an independent disciple of Kant. 14. Jacob B. Agus, "The Prophet in Modern Hebrew literature," 289-324. Though hardly giving an adequate account of OT prophetism, A. does give a good description of the chief characteristics of the prophetic spirit in this very well-written and interesting essay. For him the best representative of a true prophetic personality in modern times is Moses Hayyim Luzzato (1707-1747). The spiritual spark struck by Luzzato enkindled the Hasidic movement in the East, and the Haskalah and Reform movements in the West. A. finds but little of the prophetic spirit left in modern Hebrew literature. While Ahad Ha'am had it in part, Bialik merely used its trappings to clothe his essentially nation- alistic spirit. A. has the courage to say of most of the Zionist writers that they "endeavor to substitute resurgent nationalism for the ancient faith," and that Zionism itself is essentially "romantic nationalism, that Satanic counterpart of prophetism." 15. Ezra Spicehandler, "Miktebe Yehosüat He' šel Sor leBäruk Felsenthal" *l-*26. S. has here published for the first time a collection of twenty-six He- brew letters written at various times between 1875 and 1890 by Joshua Heschel Schorr of Brody, Galicia, to Rabbi Bernard Felsenthal of Chicago. Schorr was the editor of the liberal periodical HeHâlûs, and Felsenthal was one of the founders of Reformed Judaism in America. These letters, therefore, which speak of several of the leading Hebrew writers of the time, are of value to those interested in the literary, political and religious history of the Jews in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.
