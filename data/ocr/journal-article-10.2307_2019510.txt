<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLIII, No. 22 OCTOBER 24, 1946 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY IS REALITY REALLY COMIC? W ~tHY philosophers, especially those who stress human evalua- it 7 tions of reality as indicative of its essential nature, should have paid so little attention to the comic value and its possible im- plications is an interesting question. The comic value is quite as "given" in human experience as any other, and, unless we assume a priori that no value judgments whatsoever have cosmic signifi- cance, there is no valid reason for not taking it into account in our speculations regarding the nature of the universe. The point at issue is that of whether or no, if we found ourselves in the presence of the totality of existence, we should discover in its essential na- ture the same characteristics as, experienced in that portion of it with which we are acquainted, arouse the reaction we call the sense of humor and make us laugh. What then are these experienced characteristics which have a comic value for us and to which the sense of humor is our response? Doubtless the value needs more analysis than has yet been given it, but I think there is a fairly general agreement that it is associated with the incongruous, inconsistent, paradoxical, unexplained, and apparently spontaneous agitations and ripplings of the stream of consciousness, and with the surprise and shock they communicate to its more orderly, placid, and invariable undercurrents. The ques- tion, then, is, for the idealists, that of the extent to which those comic perturbations of the surface also agitate the depths of the mental activity which constitutes the real; for the realists, that of the extent to which they transcend experience and agitate also the substance of whatever may exist in addition to it. At first sight it might seem surprising that philosophers have generally dodged this point, and have disdained the aid of the comic value in exploring the nature of reality, while making much of its moral, esthetic, and rational aspects as insights into its char- acter. But there is at least one valid reason for their so doing. The most universal, consistent, and uninterrupted value that the universe has, or at any rate has heretofore had, for us lies in its amenability to explanation, or in what we will call its intelligible value. Indeed, we have been so happy in our ability to discover the causes of things and in progressively turning the unexplained, 589</page><page sequence="2">590 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY or even the apparently inexplicable, into the explained, that most philosophic systems, while wrangling ad infinitum over the cosmic significance or insignificance of other human values, have been at one in imputing hypothetically the value of intelligibility to the totality of existence and in assuming that in reality nothing can occur without sufficient reason. Nay more, each system defends its own views on the ground that its particular attribution or denial of these other values to the nature of the universe most contributes to the intelligible value of the real. Now, the moral values of an event, or the esthetic-other at least than the comic-are compatible and combinable with its intelligibil- ity. Things that strike us as morally or esthetically good or bad may at the same time seem and prove explicable, and may do so without thereby altering the good or bad impression they otherwise make upon us. Hence we can, if we like, interpret such values as possible indications of the nature of reality, without endangering a priori the supposition that it can be understood. And we can push them more and more deeply into it, unless or until we find that by so doing we are rendering its observed characteristics and be- havior unintelligible. The case, however, is quite different with the comic value. Al- though it is combinable with the moral, and with the other esthetic values-even with the tragic, as when we do not know whether to laugh or cry at certain situations-it is not compatible and com- binable with intelligibility. Explanation of the events possessing it does not leave it undisturbed as it does their other values, but destroys it outright. For an understanding of why things occur as they do, though it leaves them still intrinsically good, bad, or indifferent morally and esthetically, deprives them of the surprise they otherwise occasion, and thereby of their power to titillate the sense of humor. Therefore to admit that the comic value may have a cosmic significance and that it may be utilized as a possible guide to the nature of things is to admit that reality itself may possibly be irrational and unintelligible at heart, or at least that undetermined, unpredictable, spontaneous, and capricious elements may enter into its essential structure. Heretofore few modern philosophers, whether idealistic, real- istic, anthropocentric, naturalistic, theistic, or atheistic, have been willing to make such a confession. Most of them, on the contrary, have done their best to defend the essential intelligibility of the real, by entrenching it behind a wall of triple determinism, final, formal, or efficient, impenetrable in their opinion by spontaneity and chance. Even the mystics, while denying the applicability of any of the categories of human experience to the character of real-</page><page sequence="3">IS REALITY REALLY COMIC? 591 ity, have felt that intelligibility was at least the basic value of the phenomenal universe. Hence the constructive modern philosophies of the West have as a rule proposed "block-universes" of one sort or another, in which every slightest detail is sufficiently accounted for mechanically or teleologically or by logical determination, or by a combination of efficient, formal, and final causation. In such a universe nothing really undetermined, paradoxical, or startling can really take place, and the comic value rests upon a failure on our part to comprehend the intelligible pattern of the real due to the limitations of the human mind, rather than upon any lack of intelligibility in the pattern itself. More profoundly viewed, we are told, the seeming whimsicality of the behavior of things will be found to be completely explicable, and therefore humorless. When we laugh at it, we are really laughing at no more than our own misunderstanding or inadequate comprehension of its essen- tially rational character. But this triple wall of determinism defending the intelligibility of the real has never been as solid as it looks. In the first place, it is built upon the logical fallacy of begging the question. For it rests on a mere assumption that a more intimate acquaintance with the universe would dispel the comic value and leave that of intelligibility intact, whereas, for all we know, a more intimate acquaintance might do just the reverse. Again, the materials of which the deterministic wall is con- structed differ in strength. Final and formal causation have never been more than metaphysical hypotheses lacking empirical con- firmation, except for some possible but disputable indications of teleology in organic phenomena. Formal causation, in an ab- sence of knowledge of the structure of the whole that logically necessitates the nature and position of its parts, amounts to little more than saying that things are what they are because they are what they are-which does not exactly explain them. Final cau- sation, as Descartes pointed out, suffers metaphysically from the difficulty of inferring from the nature of the universe the pur- poses that are supposed to organize and direct it-which lands us in the fallacy of explaining the unknown by the more unknown. If we impose an arbitrarily selected purpose we are no better off, for then we may be accused of arguing in a circle. Moreover, as Linnaeus pointed out, an anthropocentric teleology works equally well in reverse. And the "argument from design " is riddled with instances of dysteleology. Finally the seeming "purposive- ness" detected by Kant in the reciprocal interaction of the whole and the parts of an organism may be explicable, as he himself took care to point out, in terms of efficient causation. In any case, the</page><page sequence="4">592 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY face value of teleology is that of purpose, whatever it may be, hampered, blocked, and thwarted in its fulfillment either by counter-purposes, by an "intractable matter" of some sort with which it is unable to cope, or by the interference of spontaneous, undetermined, and therefore possibly comic, events which it can neither foresee nor prevent. These three methods of accounting for the dysteleological behavior of the universe have been used, singly or in combination, throughout the history of philosophy. Efficient causation has heretofore proved the most cohesive, the strongest, the best able to bear the most weight, and therefore the most reliable and useful of the three varieties of determinism. It has worked hitherto throughout the whole field of phenomena cov- ered by the physical sciences, and nowhere in the realms of biology and psychology has its operation been successfully challenged by that of any other form of causation. In combination with mathe- matics it has been our only efficient instrument for understanding the behavior of the universe and for utilizing and applying that understanding in practical ways. And even in the sphere of meta- physical speculation final and formal causation in their palmiest days were never able to substitute themselves directly for it, but only to try to subordinate it to themselves. But even efficient causation, as we are about to see, is built, not upon a rock, but upon sand, and, at that, upon the same quicksands as undermine final and formal causation. This instability of the intelligible value as a basic and univer- sal characteristic of the nature of the real has shown itself from the beginning in cracks in the deterministic wall, which, indeed, it has been one of the chief businesses of philosophy to patch up, or, in some cases, we would rather say, to paint over. We can certainly argue, for example, that the fact that reality seems to appear to a part of itself different from what it really is, is a fact for which no explanation can be found, and which is therefore incompatible with the complete intelligibility of the totality of existence. The optimists, incidentally, have piled Ossa on Pelion by proclaiming that a universe whose conduct appears in some re- spects amoral or immoral to a part of itself can nevertheless be regarded as not only a completely intelligible but a completely moral order. Some philosophers have faced the situation frankly. The Buddhists, if I am not mistaken, admit that the obscuration of Nirvana by the veil of Maya can not be accounted for. And Schopenhauer, following their lead, tells that both the affirmation and the denial of the will to live are inexplicable. However all this may be, it is generally admitted, either openly or surreptitiously, that for the existence and nature of the real</page><page sequence="5">IS REALITY REALLY COMIC? 593 itself no sufficient reason can be found-in other words that the presence of the real is an unintelligible fact. Aristotle pointed this out in his assertion that, whatever might be the "first prin- ciples" invoked to explain the universe, they could not themselves be explained. To be sure, this defect was quickly painted over with terms like "self-caused," "self-existent," "self-explanatory," and the like. But it was not thereby repaired. For the prefix " self " in such contexts is only too often an "asylum of ignorance." Its effects are subjective rather than objective. Like the Latin polysyllabic synonyms of Anglo-Saxon monosyllables, it is a kind of shock-absorber which spares our feelings but does not lessen the roughness of the road. In the hyphenations just mentioned it is merely a delicate way, less shocking to our intellectual sensibilities, of intimating the coarse fact that causa sui = sine causa. Now, it may well be that this ultimate irrationality and unin- telligibility of the existence and nature of the real as a whole is not concentrated at the bottom, or the beginning, or the end, of the uni- verse in a fortuitous and inexplicable formal, efficient, or final cause, but peppers and salts its entire surface with a constant oc- currence of spontaneous, uncaused, unmotivated, and purposeless events, noticeable even in our daily experience. Such distribution of the uncaused and the incalculable was admitted in ancient phi- losophy by Plato, Aristotle, and the Epicureans, who included a constantly operative factor of chance and spontaneity among the constituents of the real. In our own day it has been reasserted in the tychistic hypotheses of Peirce, James, Schiller, Brown, and others, and also in their several ways by Bergson, Alexander, and Santayana. To this breach in the deterministic wall we must add that cre- ated by the unsparing attacks on the concept of causation in gen- eral launched in ancient philosophy by the skeptics, in scholastic, by Nicolas of Autrecourt, and in modern, by the British empiri- cists, most notably by Hume; which denied the possibility of either perceiving or conceiving any necessary connection of any sort whatsoever between events. And Kant, in his attempt to rehabili- tate determinism as a subjective "necessary" category of human experience, explicitly warns us against introducing any of its forms into the world of things-in-themselves, or even into possible non- human methods of perceiving or thinking. Perhaps, however, the most penetrating and obvious crack in the intelligible value is that created by the freedom of the will. For, as Kant pointed out, this is not merely a metaphysical theory but an experienced fact. We feel free in our decisions and acts. To interpret the feeling as indicative of an "indifference" of the</page><page sequence="6">594 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY will not only to external compulsion, but to determination by the character of the agent, is to regard it as expressive of a spontane- ous, uncaused tychistic activity for which we, as Hume pointed out, no more than the rest of the real, can account. If, however, we regard, as most philosophers do, the feeling of freedom as ex- pressive not of tychism, but of a "self-determination" of the will, we are little better off, since the "self" that does the determining must itself be either a tychistic or a determined event. In the one case, its existence re-opens the breach in the intelligibility of the universe that "self-determination" is supposed to patch up; in the other, the feeling of freedom turns out to be inspired, as Spinoza thought, by no more than an ignorance of the causes that inexor- ably compel us to be what we are and to behave as we do. From such compelling causes of human character and conduct, we must, however, exclude the final and the formal, unless we are content to regard their operations and effects as indiscernible from those of efficient causation-in which case, incidentally, there is no need to employ them as explanations, and to do so lays us open to the charges of unnecessarily multiplying principles of expla- nation and of the fallacy of non causa pro causa in dealing with particular phenomena. For any final or formal determination of the human will, and of human affairs in general, by other than "mechanically" motivated causes producing effects of other than "mechanical" import for us, must be regarded as either only par- tial, and therefore as not all-compelling, or as giving rise to results that contradict their supposed motivation, and therefore as unin- telligible. All this, however, is largely war in heaven whose decision one way or the other little affects human affairs on earth. Neither the individual nor society is pragmatically concerned with the meta- physical origin, whether determined or tychistic, of those human activities that feet free, self-initiated, and creative. The existence of the feeling of freedom, as evidenced objectively by the absence of perceived contemporaneous external compulsion, is sufficient basis for holding the individual morally, socially, and legally re- sponsible for his conduct, for richer for poorer, for better for worse. Our rewards and punishments, our praises and rebukes, our attributions of merit and demerit, we visit upon him and not upon his ancestors and his environment or upon chance, as we should by rights if we took metaphysics into account. Nor does the individual-or at least the virtuous individual-try to dis- claim the consequences, terrestrial or celestial, of his behavior by directing that they shall be laid upon the altar of Tyche or his grandmother's grave.</page><page sequence="7">IS REALITY REALLY COMIC? 595 Following Hume 's example, we now descend "with suitable modesty" from "these sublime mysteries" to an "examination of common life." Here we find science, as yet undisturbed by the metaphysical attacks upon determinism, extending the concept of efficient causation to an ever widening circle of observed phenom- ena and even proclaiming hypothetically a mechanistic uniformity of the whole of nature. But this complacency was soon to be shaken by a challenge, on the part of an imposing array of the scientists themselves, to our right to attribute universal validity to the laws of nature or to scientific or even to mathematical con- cepts in general. Nay more, the question was raised whether, even within the segment of the real with which we were acquainted, we could properly regard them, and with them metaphysical and theological concepts, as more than the most convenient condensa- tions, descriptions, and constructs, subject to change without notice, of the experience of the moment, whose reference to any objective reality existing independently of that experience was, to say the least, open to doubt. Such change was about to take place. Some previous notice, however, of its imminence and character was given by biology and botany, whose investigations were now suggesting that the evolution of plant and animal life, instead of being a continuous and orderly process apparently governed by causation, proceeded by fits and starts and leaps and bounds, and expressed itself in sudden muta- tions and sports, inexplicable by any of the three forms of deter- minism. Almost contemporaneously a more comprehensive and penetrating observation and analysis of inorganic phenomena re- vealed the existence of a like situation in the material aspects of the real, and gave rise to the theory of relativity, the quantum theory, and the " principle of uncertainty. " These hypotheses, supported and verified by the further investigations they inspired, seem to have uprooted efficient and mechanical, along with final and formal, causation from the physical subsoil of reality, and to have left it clinging somewhat precariously to the surface, though sufficiently firmly to countenance a trust in its reliability in so far as our practical relations with the universe are concerned. Meanwhile, the Freudian theory was initiating a revolution of the same import in psychology. Under psycho-analysis the moral and rational organization of the mind gave evidence of being a secondary and superficial aspect of mental activity, supported, not too safely, by a "censorship'" of fundamental blind, irrational, and amoral impulses, imposed upon them in the process of adapt- ing the individual to his social and physical environment. All in all, the depths of the mind seemed to be pretty much of a piece</page><page sequence="8">596 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY with intra-atomic matter and, like it, to suggest that the stable mental and physical aspects of the real are only skin deep and that beneath them pulses a fluid substance of spontaneity, chance, and caprice, whose behavior is completely undetermined and unin- telligible. In that case, both the physical sciences and psychology now in- dicate that not only has the real all the makings of the comic value, but that the comic value is more representative of its essence than any other human evaluation of its nature, and that the sense of humor is perhaps the most clairvoyant of our reactions to its con- duct. For the other values, including the intelligible, are only appraisals of its crust, and hold good only as long as that crust remains intact and will bear their weight. Any undue or exten- sive eruption of the spontaneity of the real into the phenomenal world might conceivably alter them or destroy one or another of them completely. But however it might change the relation of the real to human interests, it would still be an exhibition on the part of reality of characteristics whose appearance in our actual experience of the universe makes us laugh, provided only they do not too greatly upset the other values in conjunction with which they display themselves. To be sure, some philosophers, theologians, and scientists, while turning a cold shoulder to the possible bearings of the Freudian and the post-Freudian psychology upon the nature of mind, have warmly embraced the similar bearings of ultra-physics upon the nature of matter as fresh evidence of the existence of a stable, orderly, purposive personal intelligence governing the world-proc- ess. But surely any human person whose character was inferred from behavior like that of intra-atomic matter would be regarded, to say the least, as somewhat eccentric. Be that as it may, there would seem to be a certain inconsistency in ignoring the outcome of one line of investigation and at the same time welcoming the almost identical outcome of another, only, how- ever, to draw from the latter a conclusion not only unsupported but contradicted by both. This inconsistency is, I think, the efferves- cence of a mixture of two fears-one of anything that casts doubt upon the complete intelligibility of the real in terms of final cau- sation, the other of anything that might impair its religious value. Since the mechanical hypothesis is both such things in the opin- ion of the teleologists, they welcome all evidence of tychism as a powerful weapon to help knock it out. But to side-step the boomerang-like recoil of such evidence upon their own views, they leap without looking to the non sequitur that whatever makes the universe less intelligible from a mechanistic point of view must</page><page sequence="9">IS REALITY REALLY COMIC? 597 necessarily make it more intelligible from a teleological and theistic one. It does not seem to me, however, that the implications of the new psychology and the new physics that the real is at least par- tially and perhaps predominantly erratic at heart, and at times really comic and amusing in its behavior, need detract from its re- ligious value, even in the anthropomorphic and highly moralized form the value takes on in personal theism. To be sure, if the behavior of the material world and of the human mind are still to be regarded, as they have been in the past by many philosophers, as indications of the character of a divine person who creates, sus- tains, and directs an idealistic or a realistic universe as the case may be, our concept of his nature must apparently be altered. The idealists, whether monistic or pluralistic, will have to regard his rational and moral attributes as, like ours, the results of an incompletely established censorship of spontaneous, unmotivated, and undetermined impulses which sometimes break through it in the form of "absent-minded," capricious conduct, whose unpre- dictable eruption surprises him, and when it works evil, distresses him; just as we regret our own instability, lack of self-control, and outbursts of temper. Incidentally, this is as satisfactory a solution of the problem of evil as any the optimistic idealists have as yet proposed. The realists, however, can endow him with a more completely established censorship and a greater rational and moral stability by locating a part, at any rate, of chance and spontaneity in the non-mental constituents of the real, and by blaming on them and on God's inability to handle them success- fully the amoral and immoral features of the phenomenal world. But there is nothing particularly novel or startling in these suggestions. We customarily evaluate and deal with human per- sons on the level of the "censored" self, and only as psychiatrists are practically concerned with the lower levels of personality; just as we "do business" with the physical world on its crystallized, predictable level, and only as ultra-physicists pay much attention to what goes on beneath the surface. Even the recent, perilous tap- ping of its hidden energies, inspired by ultra-physics, has been con- ducted on the assumption that under certain conditions certain things will happen. Again, these suggestions are not unknown to theology. Ancient Greek theology conceived the gods as beings whose ra- tional and moral control, both of their own native impulses and of the course of cosmic events, was imperfect, albeit increasing. And ancient philosophy taught for the most part that any assumed rational and moral government of the world, however wisely and well intentioned it might be, must also be assumed to be impeded</page><page sequence="10">598 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and marred by intractable factors, among which chance, as we have seen, was frequently reckoned. Again, in scholastic philos- ophy Duns Scotus held that God constituted himself a rational and moral being by a spontaneous, unmotivated act of undetermined will, uncensored, we might say, by prior principles and uncontrolled by final purposes-in other words, tychistically. Finally, in our own day, James and Schiller have insisted that a moral personal God must be conceived as obstructed in his activities by intract- able external factors, to say the least, among which, in their opin- ion, chance plays a leading part. Otherwise, they contend, he can not be regarded as beneficent, and sympathetic with human ideals, and in a useful pragmatic relation of reciprocal moral cooperation with us in striving to improve the universe. In that case, we may remark in passing, the personal variety of religious experience can have real significance only in a universe in which the comic value, also, has real significance. But in that case again, we may well attribute to a personal God so circumstanced a sense of humor. The idealists may conceive him as amused and laughing at the more trivial results of his own absentmindedness; the realists at some of the unexpected and un- predictable tricks that a tychistic universe plays him. Moreover, the possession of a sense of humor would, if anything, enhance his religious value. For the comic value makes the world more in- teresting and sparkling for us, and a sense of humor enriches human experience. Why, then, should not a personal God, also, find the real more valuable for the presence of the one, and the divine experience the richer for the possession of the other? Furthermore, the sense of humor is not a purely contemplative virtue. It is a practical one as well, which helps us deal with the milder vicissitudes arising from the trying aspects of both human and cosmic behavior. Indeed, we speak of it as a "saving grace." Why, then, should we deny its solace to a God who has his troubles, toot? Like ourselves, he may not know whether to laugh or cry at times, and may take in good part the jokes that the chance and spontaneity lurking in his own character or in that of the other constituents of the real play upon him; just as we, thanks to a sense of humor, can take in good part the jokes that the inconsist- encies of our own conduct and of that of the universe so frequently play upon us. All in all, perhaps Homer was right in saying that on occasions the laughter of the Immortals shakes the skies. Let us hope so for their sake; and for our own as well, since an ability shared in com- mon to laugh at things and to laugh them off would be still another tie between man and a personal God.
