<plain_text><page sequence="1">Causal and Ex2janatory Asymmetry Daniel M. Hausnian University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 Explanations sometimes involve a certain asymmetry. For example, given Ohm's Law and the voltage of a battery, one can calculate the current in an electric circuit if one knows the resistance, or one can calculate the resistance if one knows the current. Both of these cal- culations are (roughly) deductive-nomological arguments, but only the calculation of the current from the resistance is an explanation. Why should only one of these calculations be an explanation? One plausible diagnosis of such explanatory asymmetries is that they arise from the asymmetry of causal relations (see, for example, Salmon 1978 or Beauchamp and Rosenberg 1981, p. 313). The direction of ex- planation is the direction of causation. The resistance of the wire is a causal condition influencing the amount of the current, while the amount of current does not (as a first approximation) influence the resistance. The resistance of the wire explains the quantity of cur- rent and not vice versa, because causes explain their effects, while effects do not explain their causes. But not all explanatory asymmetries reflect causal asymmetries. As Peter Railton has argued at length (1980, pp. 191-224, 385-410), there are different kinds of explanatory asymnetries. For example, one ex- plains why a substance has a certain dispositional property by identi- fying those features of underlying structure which are "responsible" for the disposition, while one does not explain why the substance has such an underlying structure by pointing out that it has a certain disposition. Even if there is a one-to-one relation between a parti- cular underlying structure and a particular disposition, the explana- tory asymnetry remains. Yet an explanation of why a substance has a disposition is not a causal explanation. The underlying structure constitutes, rather than causes the disposition. Not all explanatory asymmetries can be attributed to the asymmetry of causation.

Examples are cases like the one above involving Ohm's Law or the often-cited flagpole example (where the height of a flagpole explains the length of its shadow, but not vice versa--see Bromberger 1966, p. 71 for a Manhattan version). Such asymmetries of causal ex- planation can be of practical importance. Monetarists maintain that the quantity of money explains the value of gross national product and not (to any appreciable extent) vice versa. They are right only if the relationship between the quantity of money and the value of GNP is an asymmetric causal relation. But there is a further question concerning this diagnosis of ex- planatory asymmetries which has not been carefully considered. Why should the asymmetry of causation give rise to an asymmetry in explan- ation? The question may seem an odd one. What could be more obvious than that causes explain their effects, while effects generally do not ex- plain their causes? To give a cause is historically, etymologically and perhaps even by definition to explain. We probably know nothing about explanation which is more secure or informative than is the claim that to give a cause of a phenomenon is to explain it. Yet it is still important to ask why the asymmetry of causation gives rise to an asymmetry in explanation. In attempting to clarify and to answer this question, one may learn a great deal about the re- lations between causation and explanation. Even if it is obvious that causes explain their effects but not vice versa, it is not obvious how causes explain or how causal explanations are related to other kinds of explanations. It is no more evident now that 1 + 1 = 2 than it was be- fore the foundational studies at the turn of the century, but we now understand the relations between logic, sets and numbers better than we used to. In a similar way, in considering why causes explain their ef- fects, while effects do not generally explain their causes, we may be able to understand the relations between causality and explanation better. There is also a specific reason to consider why causal asymmetries should give rise to explanatory asymmetries. On the dominant Humean view of causation, it seems that the amount of current should explain the resistance in a circuit just as well as the amount of resistance explains the amount of current. On Hume's view of causation, the only difference between causes and effects is, of course, that causes come before their effects in time. The constant conjunction between cause and effect can be equally constant from either direction. The tenden- cy of the mind to pass from the impression of the cause to the idea of the effect seems, in Hume's view at least, to be no stronger than the tendency of the mind to pass from the impression of the effect to the idea of the cause. All there is is a difference in time order. Why should position in time matter so much to explanation? Perhaps people are irrational and mistaken when they deny that the current in the wire explains the resistance or that the length of the shadowi of a flagpole</page><page sequence="3">45 explains its height. But let us postpone discussing this implausible suggestion until we have considered a more moderate alterrnative. One possible way to retain a Humean analysis of causation without denying that there are genuine asymmetries of causal explanation is to insist that explanation is largely subjective or pragmatic. Bas van Fraassen offers such an account of explanation and of explanatory asymmetries (1980, ch. 5). He argues, "If that is correct, if the asymmetries of explanation result from a contextually determined rela- tion of relevance, . . . it should then also be possible to account for specific asymmetries in terms of the interests of questioner and audi- ence that determine this relevance." (1980, p. 130). In van Fraassen's treatment, explanations are answers to context-dependent why ques- tions. One might then attempt to connect causal and explanatory asymmetries by arguing that why questions are often requests for the salient or relevant cause of a phenomenon. To identify an effect of the phenom- enon will clearly not satisfy such a request. But this way of connec- ting explanatory and causal asymmetries is trivial. It reformulates rather than answers the basic question: Why, in asking "Why?" should one be asking for a cause rather than an effect? One needs some ac- count of why causal order (time order, if one is a Humean) should be of so much significance when one's object is explanation or understanding. One cannot make sense of the asymmetry of causal explanation without noticing that there is more to causal priority than merely temporal priority. Either one needs some other analysis of causal asymmetry than Hume's, or one must show how a difference in time order gives rise to other significant differences between causes and effects. In at- tempting to give an alternative analysis of causal asymmetry, philoso- phers like Collingwood (1940), Gasking (1955) and von Wright (1975) have pointed out that causes are, as it were, levers for moving ef- fects. If one jacks up or bends a flagpole, its shadow will grow long- er or shorter, while if one alters the shadow (perhaps by sloping the ground), the flagpole's height will be unaffected. As an independent analysis of causal asymmetry, manipulability runs into intractable difficulties (Beauchamp and Rosenberg 1981, pp. 203-8; Ehring 1981, ch. 3). But the brute fact remains that agents manipulate effects via their causes. One would not normally attempt to change the resistance in a circuit by changing the amount of current flowing in it. tioreover, one can, to a considerable extent, account for this a- symmetry of manipulability by the difference in time order Hume relies on. Agents are, after all, able to affect the future, but not the past. Manipulability then forms one leg for Hunmean-pragmatic accounts of explanatory asymmetries to stand on. The fact that causes are often "levers" for moving effects, coupled with a pragmatic theory of explanation like van Fraassen's, makes it possible to explain why causal asymmetries should give rise to explan- atory asymmetries. Agents are usually much more interested in the</page><page sequence="4">46 causes than in the effects of a certain phenomenon, because they want to know how to bring about or to prevent the phenomenon. Given this practical interest, we ask "Why?" to find out about causes, not ef- fects. Sometimes, of course, causal explanations are of no practical help, but one might argue that agents extend their general course of questioning to such cases, too. Causes thus explain their effects, while effects do not generally explain their causes. One can sunmarize this Humean-pragmatic connection between causal and explanatory asymmetry as follows: Explanations are answers to context-dependent why questions. Such questions are frequently re- quests for causes and rarely requests for effects, because in the pervasive context of potential actions, knowledge of causes is es- pecially important. In the context of potential action, knowledge of causes is crucial, because one can manipulate events via their causes, but not via their effects. This asymmetry of manipulability results (perhaps) from the two facts that causes precede their effects and that present action can alter the future, but not the past. So the temporal priority of causes should result in asymmetries in causal explanations. The above account of why requests for explanation are requests for causes and not for effects is overly simple. It misleadingly suggests that one is particularly interested in causes mainly when one is about to act and when one is concerned with phenomena within one's control. The context within which, in asking for an explanation, one wants to know the causes is in fact much more general. As actors our construal of counterfactuals leads to a more general perspective within which knowledge of causes is especially important. As actors or interveners, agents often ask, "What if. . . ?"1 Con- sider two such questions: (1) What if the resistance in this circuit were larger? (2) What if there were more current flowing in this cir- cuit? Given Ohm's Law, there are as many possibilities in the first case as in the second. But the usual answer to these questions reveals an asymmetry. In answer to (1), one would say that if there were more resistance in the circuit, less current would be flowing. In answer to (2), in contrast, one would assert only that if there had been more current flowing, there would have been less resistance or a higher voltage (see Simon and Rescher 1966, pp. 125-30). The different way in which we respond to the two "What if?" ques- tions reflects our perspective as actors and the faot that when one intervenes and changes something, one generally influences only its effects. This asymmetry of manipulability leads us imaginatively to hold fixed the voltage when considerirng a circuit with a larger resis- tance and to believe that there would be less current. The supposi- tion that there is more current, on the other hand, leads to no deter- minate results. From the perspective of action in this context, the latter supposition is sterile. All we know is that something must have been different. Our interests as actors thus lead us to regard effects as counter-</page><page sequence="5">47 factually dependent on their causes and not vice versa. Moreover, as actors, agents are interested not only in what does happen, but in what can and must happen. Given this general interest in counterfactuals and this general interpretation of counterfactuals, agents ask "Why?" to find out why phenomena had to (or were made more likely to) occur (where these modal notions are to be understood as suggested in the paragraph above). An agent's desire to know the cause does not follow isnLediatelv from any practical interest. It derives instead from an interest in understanding not only what does, but what might or must happen. This general interest in turn follows from practical interests in action. When one asks why something occurred, one wants to know the cause, not, typically, because one has any immediate interest in doing anything, but because, knowing the cause, one can construct an account of what might and must occur, which in turn is vital for action. In this more indirect and sophisticated way, our interests lead us to regard causes as explaining their effects, but not vice versa. (This view is, I think, implicit in ch. 5 of van Fraassen's The Scientific ImaFg (1980).) Notice that there is nothing in the above discussion to which Hume need object. Although the more sophisticated account relies on coun- terfactuals, the truth of these is determined by the way in which agents think about the world, not by any fact about necessities in nature. As van Fraassen puts it, ". . . there is nothing in science itself--nothing in the objective description of nature that science purports to give us--that corresponds to these counterfactual condi- tionals." (1980, pp. 115-16). What we have in effect noticed in the above discussion of the relations between causal and explanatory asym- metries is that the "customary transition of the imaginatiorn" (Hume 17148, p. 86) f'rom the idea of a cause to the idea of its effect dif- fers in important ways from the propensity of the mind to pass from the idea of an effect to the idea of its cause. Although subtle and ingenious, I believe that such pragmatic inter- pretations of explanatory asymmetries are mistaken. What bothers me is that there is little difference between, on the one hand, showing how (given a pragmatic account of explanation) causal asymmetries should give rise to explanatory asymmetries and, on the other, showing how (given an objective account of explanation) our perspective as actors causes us mistakenly to believe that there are such asymmetries. On a pragmatic view of explanatory asymmetries, only our practical interests provide us with grounds to prefer a purported explanation that cites a cause to one that cites an effect. It is only because actors seek to trace events to their causes that people regard causes as explaining their effects and deny that effects explain their causes. The above observation is hardly a decisive criticism. One way to challenge such a pragmatic interpretation of explanatory asymmetries is to concede and indeed to emphasize the importance of counterfactuals, but then to argue that counterfactuals state objective truths. One can then offer a non-Humean counterfactual analysis of causal asymmetry (see Lewis 1973, p. 190 or Swain 1978, p. 11) and relate causal and ex-</page><page sequence="6">48 planatory asymmetries by examining the connection between explanation and counterfactuals. I shall not, however, follow this path. Nor shall I directly attack Humean-pragrmatic interpretations of explanatory asymmetries. I shall instead attempt to show that, apart from our practical interests and any discussion of counterfactuals, explanations in terms of causes are far better explanations than ones in terms of effects. To establish this objective basis for the asyrmetries of causal explanations, I shall rely on a non-Humean analysis of causal asymmetry (see Mackie 1974, esp. ch. 7 for the classic modern formulation of the problem of causal asymmetry). This analysis of causal asyrametry will incidentally clarify the fact that the manipula- bility theorists rely on and will purge it of its anthropomorphism. I shall also venture some comments on the nature of scientific explana- tion. As a first step, let us consider briefly the account of causal asym- metry presented and defended in chapter 8 of Bernard Berofsky's book, Determinism (1971). I shall later argue against Berofsky's account, but it vividly reveals an important aspect of the asyrmetry of causal explanation. Stripped to its bare essentials, Berofsky's account maintains that event X is causally prior to event Y if and only if the law which links X to Y is part of the most comprehensive adequate systematic theory of phenomena like Y, while there are more comprehensive adequate systema- tic theories of phenomena like X than any which include the law which links X to Y (pp. 265-67). Theories of phenomena like shadows include the law that light travels in straight lines. Theories of phenomena like the size of poles or towers do not include laws of optics. Berof- sky's view thus correctly implies, for example, that the height of a flagpole is a cause of the length of its shadow. From the perspective of this paper, the most interesting feature of Berofsky's account of causal asynmetry is the way in which it enables one to connect causal and explanatory asymmetries. When one links Y to one of its causes, X, through some generalization, one is ultimately bringing Y under a general systematic comprehensive theory of phenomena like Y, while the generalization cannot be embedded in any comprehen- sive theory of phenomena like X. The isolated link between X and Y does little to explain any aspect of X. Isolated linkages provide worse explanations than do relationships which may be embedded in com- prehensive theories. One feature of explanations that has been recognized by many auth- ors is that they reduce the extent to which the phenomena they explain appear to be merely contingent happenings. Some such intuition is in- volved in the otherwise unacceptable view that explanations involve a reduction of the unfamiliar to the familiar. Hempel attempts to cap- ture this intuition with his notion of "explanatory relevance" (1966, p. 48)--his view that an explanation should show that the phenomenon to be explained was to be expected. 'Clearly, then, the phenomenon. . is here explained, and thus understgod, by showing that its occurrence was</page><page sequence="7">49 to be expected under the specified circumstances in view of certain general laws. . .'" (Hempel 1965, p. 364). The most satisfactory way of capturing this intuition is, however, Michael Friedman's (1974). Friedman argues that "unification or reduction in the number of independent phenomena is the essence of explanation in science. . . ( 1974, p. 15). In explaining a happening or a fact, one shows that it is not just some disconnected occurrence. A good explanation reveals the extent to which the happening to be explained is linked to other, more general phenomena. The more extensive and systematic the linkages (and thus the more general the phenomena to which the happening is linked), the better the explanation. If one crucial virtue of scientific explanations is the extent to which they unify phenomena and reduce the number of independent phenomena, then "locating" the fact or happening to be explained in a general systematic comprehensive theory will explain it better than will citing an isolated regularity. (Although I believe that Friedman's technical apparatus can be adapted to my needs, I am only relying on his basic intuition. Notice, by the way, that his explication of the notion of "independence" is quite different than mine.) If one grants that an event is better explained by a generalization when the generalization can be embedded in a comprehensive and system- atic theory of phenomena like the particular event, then Berofsky's account enables one to show why causes explain their effects, while effects do not explain their causes very well. Only when a phenomenon is linked to its cause is it exhibited as an instance of some general systematic feature of the world. (From this perspective one can, inci- dentally, appreciate more fully the explanatory importance of counter- factual determination.) Notice that this difference in explanatory adequacy is not subjec- tive or pragmatic. On Berofsky's view, it is not which theories we happen to have which matters, but which theories ideally exist. A generalization which links an event to one of its causes forges in principle links to a whole range of phenomena. Such a linkage enables one, as it were, to recognize the event's definite theoretical loca- tion. From a generalization connecting an event to one of its effects, on the other hand, one can construct no such system of interconnec- tions. The cause remains, as it were, unlocated, unconnected, "contin- gent". Berofsky's account thus enables one to show how causal asymmetries can give rise to explanatory asymmetries. It also permits one to demonstrate that the asymmetry of explanation is not only a result of our perspective as actors. But Berofsky's account of causal asymmetry is inadequate. Will it account for the Ohm's Law example above? It clearly fails, as Douglas Ehring has pointed out (1981, pp. 137-39), when the cause is a random phenomenon. In such a case, the most sys- tematic thing one may ever be able to say of phenomena like the par- ticular cause is that they are linked by various laws to certain ef- fects. In such a case, on Berofsky's view, there would be no causal asymme try.</page><page sequence="8">50 Underlying both Berofsky's account and the facts concerning manipu- lability is, I believe, a single basic objective asymmetry which con- stitutes the asymmetry of causation. There are different ways to get at this basic asymmetry. David Sanford (1976) and Douglas Ehring (1981, ch. 8) have, in their own ways, focused on the same fundamental feature. But I shall stick with my own account (Hausman forthcoming). The basic asymmetry that accounts for both the asymmetry of manipu- lability and the asymmetry of inclusion in comprehensive systematic theories is an asymmetry of 'connectedness". If an event X is causally connected to an event Y, then (and only then) there will typically be some sort of an association or correla- tion or stochastic dependence between events like X and events like Y. This fact provides a "quasi-operational definition" of the notion of a causal connection. Notice that I am not saying that the existence of a correlation or a stochastic dependence is either necessary or suffi- cient for the existence of a causal cFnnection. Correlations or depen- dencies give us empirical "purchase" on the notion of a causal con- nection--that is, they reliably indicate when two events are causally connected and provide some of the meaning of the notion of a causal connection. Reflection and experience reveal that two events X and Y are causal- ly connected when and only when X causes Y, Y causes X, X and Y have a common cause or X and Y are mutually dependent (if there is such a thing as mutual dependence). This last claim is no a definition of "causal connection". We know independently when causal connections obtain from the "quasi-operational definition' above. They are the sorts of relations reliably indicated by correlations or dependencies. We discover from experience that causal connections come in only the three or f'our varieties mentioned. Given the notion of a causal connection (which is, of course, in need of further analysis), one can give the following truth conditions for "X causes (or is a causal condition of) Y': X causes Y if and only if (1) X and Y are causally connected, (2) everything causally connected to X is causally connected to Y, and (3) something is causally connected to Y but not to X. For example, everything causally connected to the flagpole having a particular height (certain bungling on the part of those who built it, perhaps) is causally connected to its having a shadow of a particular length at a particular time, while something is causally connected to the length of the shadow (such as the angle of elevation of the sun), but not to the height of the f'lagpole. On this account the difference between causes and effects lies in the connectedness of effects of a common cause and the relative inde-</page><page sequence="9">51 pendence of the various causes of a single effect. When X causes Y there will be some other cause or causal condition of Y which is not causally connected to X, while everything that X causes will be caus- ally connected to Y. The full elaboration and defense of this view of causal asymmetry is too large a task for this paper and has been undertaken elsewhere. Mly goal here, instead, is to show how this view of causal asymmetry (and, in similar ways, Ehring's and Sanford's views) relates causal and explanatory asymmetries. When one identifies a cause or a causal condition of some event, one links that event to everything causally connected to that cause or causal condition. On the other hand, when one identifies an effect of some event, one brings about no such comprehensive linkage to that event. In establishing such comprehensive linkage, one is giving a better explanation. On a view of scientific explanations as reducing "mere contingency" through unifying and establishing systematic interconnections among phenomena and through reducing the number of independent phenomena, causes will explain their effects better than effects will explain their causes. Through its relationship with its cause, an event is comprehensively linked to a whole network of events. The relation of an event to its cause should thus be embedded in a systematic compre- hensive theory of happenings like the given event. What is right about Berofsky's asymmetry of inclusion in systematic theories thus follows from the asyraimetry of connectedness. Given the asymmetry of connected- ness, knowledge of causes leads to theoretical unification of our know- ledge of the event phenomena and not vice versa. Causal asymmetry should give rise to explanatory asymmetry. The objective asynmetry of connectedness upon which my account of causal asynametry is based also explains why causal explanations are so important from the perspective of human action. For the manipulabil- ity theorists, human ability to act lies at the core of causal asym- metry. The manipulability theorist claims that X causes Y if and only if, acting and affecting X, one can affect Y, but acting and affecting Y (if we can), except via X, one does not affect X. There is a con- siderable measure of truth in these claims. How on my account cf causal asymmetry are the facts of manipulability to be understood? Manipulability is not some independent fact about causality, but is instead a direct corollary of my analysis of causality and the fact (which von Wright implausibly contests, 1975, pp. 48-62) that actions are events. Doing something which is causally connected to the cause will register in the effect, because everything causally connected to the cause is causally connected to the effect. Doing something which is causally connected to the effect need not register in the cause, because not all of the various causes of any given event are causally connected to one another. The practical difference between causes and effects follows from the objective difference in connectedness.</page><page sequence="10">52 In this paper I have offered an answer to the question of why causal asymmetries should give rise to explanatory asymmetries--of why causes should explain their effects so much better than effects ex- plain their causes. The answer is that effects are linked by their causes to a local causal network. From knowledge of causes of certain phenomena, one obtains more systematic and comprehensive "placement" of the phenomena than one obtains from knowledge of effects of the phenom- ena. The alternative "Humean" way of making sense of the asymmetry of causal explanation stresses manipulability and the pragmatics of ex- planation. On this alternative--as van Fraassen has argued--explana- tory asymmetries are based on pragmatic considerations. They are a function of our interests as actors and of our consequent construals of counterfactuals. The account of the asymmetry of causal explanation defended here--in terms of an objective asymmetry of connectedness-- need not repudiate the pragmatic aspects of causal and explanatory asymmetries. Instead it reveals their basis in the central objective difference between causes and effects. Notea I am deeply indebted to many more people than can be named here. Particularly to be thanked are Douglas Ehring, without whose help I could never have made progress with the problems of causal asymmetry, and Eugene Pidzarko, David Sanford and Paul Thagard, who offered help- ful criticisms of the paper.
