<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEABHAR GABHALA PART II: THE GROWTH OF THE TRADITION R. MARK SCOWCROFT University of Virginia, Charlottesville Students of early Irish tradition have too often pursued a kind of literary archaeology, excavating (sometimes creating) documentary ruins out of which to reconstruct pagan antiquity. Ignoring or dismissing the churches built of that same ancient stone, they may fail to see that their reconstruc- tions rest on cruciform foundations: that traditions as suggestive to the historian as the Milesian invasion or as meaningful to the mythologist as the two battles of Mag Tuired belong in fact to the architecture of medieval learning rather than to its vernacular building-materials. If the study of Leabhar Gabhala (LG) - medieval Ireland's chronicle of her past - had only this negative, corrective value, it would still be essential to Celtic scholar- ship. But the text is so interesting in itself, both as historiography and as mythography, that it deserves the attention of those who prefer the study of culture to its reconstruction. THE TEXT AND THE TRADITION This essay is the second (and final) part of an introduction to LG, part I of which treated the manuscripts, recensions, and contents of the medieval text.' An anonymous, scholarly compilation designed to provide Ireland and her inhabitants with a continuous and comprehensive history from Noah to the Norman conquest, LG tends to grow from copy to copy, and new recensions develop from the conflation of older ones. Recensions antece- dent to the four recognized for the medieval period can be postulated on the basis of common testimony, though this does not necessarily permit the reconstruction of textual archetypes. Though imprecise, therefore, as a description of LG's manuscript history, the resulting stemma tells us a great deal about the genesis and development of its contents as a tradition - as 'See 'Leabhar Gabh6la - part I: the growth of the text', triu 38 (1987), 81-142, and addi- tional notes appended below.

The extant medieval recensions of LG represent two branches (p and a) of a single canon (co), and four successive conflations of them. Each branch survives uncontaminated by the other (although otherwise expanded) in one recension: p in the miniugud recension (m), which is attached as an appendix to the second recension (b) in the Great Book of Lecan (L), RIA MSS #537-9 (Y), and Bodleian MS Rawlinson B 512 (R); and a in the version of b, here called r, found in R and TCD MS #1433 (E). Testimony shared by these recensions was probably in c. The first conflation of p and a yielded the first recension (a), as represented by the copy in the Book of Leinster (LL); the second, of a and an expanded version of a (fl), yielded 6, a version of a best represented by the Book of Fermoy (F); the third, the adoption of matter from 6 by two copies of b, yielded I (represented by L and Y) and d (represented by RIA MS #1224 (D)); and the fourth, a con- flation of I and the exemplar of F (f), yielded the third recension (c) - as represented by L (which thus comprises three recensions of LG), the Book of Ballymote (BB), and TCD MS #1316 (H) - the innovations in which, though mentioned in part I, are generally too late to be relevant to this discussion. These sigla will be used to indicate stages of development in the LG canon, groups of derivative versions, their common testimony, and the provenance of passages (cited by paragraph-number) in Macalister's edi- tion.2 The poems he includes are cited by the Roman numerals he gives them, as are the Milesian kings. Macalister divides his edition into ten sections, but these belong to three historically distinct tracts which appear (mutatis mutandis) in all versions of LG - may thus be said to define it - and to supplementary tracts accruing variously to the Middle-Irish recensions. After an introduction - in m a (Latin) description of Ireland, in a a summary of biblical history from Creation to the Tower of Babel, and in c a translation (with com- mentary) of Genesis I-XI -the first tract, De Imthechtaib Gaedel, describes the origins and pedigree of the Gaedil and the wanderings that culminated in their conquest of Spain, at which point the narrative breaks off to accom- modate the second tract, De Gabhlaib Jrenn. In m, this takes the form of a list of pre-Milesian invaders, the kings of the Fir Bolg and Tuatha De Danann, and the genealogies of the latter; in ca, this information is sup- plemented by a series of invasion-narratives (Macalister's sections III-VII), and Cessair is added (as the first invader) to the canon. The text finally returns to the Gaedil in Spain, brings the sons of Mil and their followers thence to Ireland, and discusses their descendants. Macalister asserts that the Milesian invasion belongs properly to the first tract, into which the second has been interpolated. He cites the arrangement 2R. A. S. Macalister (ed.), Lebor Gabala trenn (hereafter LGE) (5 vols), Irish Texts Society (ITS), vols xxxiv, xxxv, xxxix, xli, and xliv (Dublin 1938-56). For a guide to this incomplete and confusing edition see the appendix to part I.</page><page sequence="3">LEABHAR GABHALA 3 of Nennius's Historia Brittonum, in which the section corresponding to tract II (§§13-14) precedes that relating the history of the Gaedil from their sojourn in Egypt to their invasion of Ireland (§1 5).3 He is doubtless correct in this supposition but wrong to condemn the arrangement of LG as illogi- cal. Since Nennius describes the Milesian invasion twice, we must assume that both tracts comprised it originally and will see that other early repre- sentations of one tract or the other always include it. To judge from what m shows us was w's version of the Milesian invasion, a has provided the same kind of narrative treatment for it as for the other invaders, and it seems reasonable to consider all these narratives as part of tract II. The author of the conflation avoids repetition by fusing the two accounts of the Milesians, thus 'interpolating' one tract into the other. The result is a history of the Irish that pauses to present a history of Ireland, bringing them into it at their appointed time. The third tract, which follows (the interpolated) tract I, was originally composed as a discussion of the dynasties that controlled the Tara kingship, from the children of trem6n mac Miled (I) to Tuathal Techtmar (XCV) who reconquered Ireland after the revolt of her subject peoples. An ex- panded version of this tract survives in b, but its title survives only in LL469: Do tlathiusaib Herend 7 dia Hamseraib 56 Rt Mac Miled co Hamsir Tuathail Techtmair. Most of b's text appears also in a (and hence derives from a), and traces show through the king-list laid over it by (as represented by m) - here called the Reim Rigraide - which names instead every king of Tara, his regnal years, and the circumstances of his death, from Erem6n to Nath I (CXV), the nephew of Niall Noigiallach (CXIV) and predecessor of Loe- gaire mac N6ill (ob. 461/3). Subsequent recensions continue to add details of a genealogical or legendary character, and incorporate narratives about the Picts (in p and 1), the tributary populations called aithechthuatha (in b), and the B6roma tribute (in Lc). Recensions a, b, and Rm extend this king-list with independent accounts of the (historical) kings of Tara from Loegaire right down to the twelfth century (tract(s) V). Recension b also interpolates chapters of a tract (IV) synchronizing Irish pseudo-history with that of the world from the beginning of the Third Age to the eighth century, and finish- es its text with m (tract VI). These additions to the canon, which are dis- cussed at length in part I, receive (except for m) no further treatment here. The composition of cx and w, which drew in complete versions of tracts II and III respectively, is associated with the work of two important poets, Eochaid ua Floinn (ob. 1004) and Gilla Coemain (fl. 1072). In a series of poems climaxed by the comprehensive 'Eitset aes ecna aibind' (LXV), Eoch- aid treats the invasions of Ireland from Cessair through the Milesians, and the rulers of Ireland from the first king of the Fir Bolg to Oengus Olmuccaid (XIII); two other poems treat the foundation of Emain Machae and the 3LGE, I, xxx-xxxii.

MARK SCOWCROFT division and governance of Ireland by Ugaine Mor (LVI) and his descend- ants.4 Eochaid's poems so closely agree with the prose in a that one suspects him of involvement in its composition. Detailed examination of the evidence shows, however, that he based his poems on a version of the prose-text more primitive than the common testimony of a and b, which had time to develop further before the two branches broke apart.' Though one cannot be sure that he was the author of this proto-x, he clearly designed his poetry to accompany it, and marks the stage at which it reached the status of a recension; subsequent alterations are relatively minor. It is not unreason- able, therefore, to postulate his obit as a terminus ante quem for the composi- tion of a. Other important additions to a include the biblical preface (tract I(A)); two poems by a certain Tanaide on the kings of the Fir Bolg (XLVII) and Tuatha De Danann (LIV);6 a famous group of poems attributed to Amargen mac Miled (LXIX-LXXII); and a tract (III(D)) on the life of Tuathal Techtmar incorporating descriptions of the revolt and reconquest of his subjects and the origins of the Boroma. To P Gilla Coemaiin contributes three poems, two of which reproduce its entire testimony. 'Gaedel Glas otaat Gaedil' (XIII) treats Y's version of tract I as far as ith's visit to Ireland, and 'Eriu ard, inis na rrig' (CXV) carries on from there, treating the invasions and rulers of Ireland from Cessair to Loegaire mac Neill and the advent of St Patrick; the third poem, 'Tigernmas mac Follaig aird' (XCVI), recounts the attributes of that king (VII), the battles he fought, the lakes and rivers that burst forth during his 4See part I, note 114 (p. 120) for a list of Eochaid's poems in LG. Just before the poem on Emain Machae in b551bis appears another (aXCVIII), also by Eochaid, on the fortresses of Sobairce and Cermna, but these kings appear as IX in p507, and the poem accordingly in a507, so it cannot be considered a continuation of the text represented by aLXV. 5Because the prose and poetry correspond so closely - and in the Cessair-saga show signs of having been composed at the same time - the best criterion for determining which came first is the treatment of lists, which if originating in prose must be rearranged to fit Eochaid's demanding metres, but are less likely to be rearranged if adopted by the prose from the poetry. Though a and b sometimes modify sequences derived from a - and are not always faithful to poetic sources either (e.g. b257 from aXLII:8-10 or a554 from aCIX, both poems by Eochaid) - it is always possible to reconstruct from the poetic and (two) prose versions the prose sequence in a (see e.g. a203, b219, and aXXX:12-16, or a240, b252, and aXLI:13-15). Poems aLXVII and aLXV:35ff correspond, moreover, to prose passages that reconstruction shows were in w. Matter probably added to a after Eochaid's poetry includes Cessair's shipwreck (a 170, h177), the death of Fea (a201, b215), the invasion of Cicol Gricenchos (a202, b216), the fourth plain cleared by Parthol6n (though a204 and b214 disagree over its name), Nemed's voyage from Scythia (a237, b248), the origins of Loch nAnnind (a238, b250), the battle of Ros FraechAin (a239 and cf. b253), the Fomorian excavation of Raiith Chindeich (a239, 6251), some river-names in a505, and some battle-names in a5II; the Genelach Tuath nDe (tract II(G)3) is fuller in a and b than in aLIV. 6The identification of this poet as Tanaide Ua Maoil-Chonaire, with an obit of 1136, rests on no convincing evidence (see Paul Walsh, Irish Men of Learning (Dublin 1947), 35) and is incompatible with the chronology of these recensions, especially if aXLVII appeared originally in p (and thus in w). In fact, the poem is echoed by the prose of a and p, so must antedate their composition. Into a sentence that survives intact in m303, a interpolates 'cennfinna uile bae Herend 'na erchomair' (LL280; F reads remes for erchomair, b288 flaith), which is a quotation (omitting a cheville) of verse 5c-d. In m303 and aXLVII:6, on the other hand, Rindail dies 'i nEba', which is expanded in a280 to 'i nEba Choirpri' (LL, D288) and written sufficiently ambiguously by 6 to generate 'i nEba Croibi' (F) and 'i ndebaig Craibe' (Y288; Lb</page><page sequence="5">LEABHAR GABHALA 5 reign, and his descendants. This poem is one of a group accruing to p (XCIII, XCV, XCIX-CI, CVI, CVII) that thus celebrate the early Milesian kings, recording in metrical form testimony found in the prose as early as w. Subsequent recensions perform the same service for many other kings. Gilla Coemain appears, like Eochaid, to have composed these three poems as companion-pieces to the prose-text, but CXV also incorporates testimony found only in c: the invasion of Cessair, the circumstances surrounding the death of the Partholonians, Togail Tuir Chonaind (tract II(E)2), the division of Ireland by the Fir Bolg, and so forth. Clearly the poetry of Gilla Coemain was added finally to the recension on which it was based, and the prose-text underwent no subsequent revision. Since CXV was written after 1072, we can thus postulate that year as the terminus post quem for the composition of p in its final form.7 The most important section in the poem lists every Milesian king down to historical times, along with regnal years, the circum- stances of death, and other occasional details. This, the metrical counterpart to p's recomposition of tract III, has antecedents in the metrical king-lists of Flann Mainistrech (ob. 1056), which accrued (as tract V(C)) to b, but adds to their testimony a chronology. Other important additions to p in- clude 'Dena mo freisneis a meic' (XLVIII), attributed to Colum Cille, which supplements ip's meagre information about the Fir Bolg, Tuatha D6 Danann, and Milesians - it may also be a late addition - 'Estid a eolchu cen on' (LVI), by Flann Mainistrech, on how the Tuatha De Danann met their deaths, and a short account of the Picts in Ireland (tract III(A)). Though the composition of tracts II and III in their full form belongs to a and p respectively, more primitive testimony in m and b invites the re- construction of prototypes in w. This proves more difficult than the re- construction of tract I, versions of which survive in all three early recen- sions, because we are here dealing with the conflation of different texts is defective here); since r288 has nothing here, despite the inclusion of the poem by a, the readings in m and a predicate an addition to the prose of p identical to the testimony of a poem cited by first line only (as the equivalent of tract II) in m. Another addition by p to the common text is so close to verse 12c-d that the comparison of them helps an editor choose the best readings for the latter, which are (pace Macalister) 'leo rogaet cetter do rind / Eocho mac Eirc i nEirind' (a reads iat gonsat for leo rogaet; LL reads cetrig for ctf/er). Compare ('conid s6 cetna fer rogaet do rind i nEirind (sc. ar tiis R)' in m303, and 'is e c6ter do rind rogaet i ntirind' in a280 (LL reads cttri for cetfer and ar tus after rogaet), which must be quoting directly from the poem to produce such word-order. Gilla Coemain versifies this text in turn as 'is e sin c&amp;tter do rind / rogaet ar tuis i ntrind' (pCXV:24c-d). The Book of Leinster omits is and reads cttri for cjtfer; the editors' emendation to secure the metre should be corrected accord- ingly (R. I. Best and Osborn Bergin (eds), The Book of Leinster (hereafter LL) Vol. III (Dublin 1957), 11 14751f.). Macalister here reproduces the text of c, which interpolates four lines (23c-d and 24a-b), borrowed themselves from XLVII:8c-d and 12a-b, between what were originally couplets of a single verse. The second of these is rewritten as "siad romarb c6tter do rind / Eocho mac Eirc a ntrinn (adbeirim L)', thus returning to the text of XLVII:12d). Here again, p has drafted in matter from XLVII which survives as near-quotation in a, prose- paraphrase in m, and a new couplet in CXV, which contributes in turn the phrase ar tzis to Rm303 and LL280 (cf. also the occasional appearance of Eocho or Eochu for Eochaid in Rb289 and LL280, the scribes of which must have been quite familiar with these lines from XLVII). 70On the date of CXV see part I, p. 135.</page><page sequence="6">6 R. MARK SCOWCROFT about the same traditional topics and must reconstruct therefore on the basis of divergent rather than common testimony, hoping that the latter did not provide the compilers with an occasion for deletion. The summary of tract II in wc has bequeathed to a an otiose paragraph on the pre-Milesian invasions (a166, b172), just before what LL169 tells us is De Gabalaib Erenn. The version in m303 is more primitive in its omission of Cessair and the brevity of its citations, but it breaks off with the Fir Bolg to treat their kings, and never returns to the list at all. Here one could argue either that the summary in wc was thus expanded into a pre-Milesian king-list for pY (vide m303, p310-13, p315) or that a text of this sort in wo was rewritten by c, the primitive king-list (represented best by b335 and b354) being merged into tract II proper. The Genelach Tuath nDt, as I argued in part I, has a common core of testimony which could have been in cw, but it is really impossible to be sure since bare genealogies rarely give one the opportunity to distinguish agreement (within a tradition) from textual affinity, and the abbreviated condition of m316A leaves us very little text to work with anyway. Early testimony to the invasions does little more than list them,8 and the obvious concern of p to provide the Irish with a pedigree back to Noah and a continuous sequence of kings would certainly account for the extension of the paragraph to cover regnal and genealogical matters. In any case, both Eochaid ua Floinn and Gilla Coemain used the interpolation as a starting-point for major poems on the ancient history and kings of Ireland. This focus on the Tara kingship is characteristic not only of p but of the version of tract III preserved in b, and merits consideration as central to LG from the beginning. Like p's version of tract II, tract III in b comprises testimony which reconstruction does not allow us to postulate for ao, but represents nevertheless an older stage in the growth of the canon. Com- parison with a allows us to postulate most of b's text for ca; comparison with m, however, allows us to postulate no more for wt than substantial entries on the early Milesian kings (I, II, IV-VII, X-XIII) - comprising the sort of testimony rehearsed by Gilla Coemaiin in poem XCVI - on the foundation of Emain Machae and Ulidian capture of the high-kingship (the flaithius Ulad), and on the reign of Ugaine M6r. Eochaid's poems also reflect this sequence of major topics, and the beginnings of a king-list, halted for some reason after Oengus Olmuccaid, no doubt inspired its continuation in p. Many additional remarks, which if originally in co have since been sup- pressed or absorbed without obvious traces by i, expand this small core of testimony into a charter, as it were, for the Tara kingship in historical times. 81 discuss the testimony of the (early ninth-century) Historia Brittonum and its (eleventh- century) Irish translation, Lebor Bretnach, below. See also Schl Tudin meic Cairill / Immacallam Tucin fri Finnia, assigned by John Carey in his edition to the ninth century (triu 35 (1984), 93ff), which gives very little information about the invaders from Parthol6n to the Milesians (though what it does say, as we shall see, differs in interesting ways from LG). The saga-lists, which are generally assigned to the second half of the tenth century, cite the migrations (toch- omlada) of Parthol6n, Nemed, the Fir Bolg, the Tuatha Di Danann, Mil (sic), his sons, and the Cruithnig (see Proinsias Mac Cana (ed.), The Learned Tales of Medieval Ireland (Dublin 1980), 48f., 59f.).</page><page sequence="7">LEABHAR GABHALA 7 As I have argued in part I, the versions of tract III in m (thus Y) and b (thus c) differ less in fundamental doctrine than in their approach to it, m noticing each of a long list of kings in succession while b discusses dynasties, eras and events. It is, of course, tempting to read the latter as a sort of commentary on the former, like the essays that introduce and explain major genealogical tracts. Perhaps this was the purpose of the tract to begin with, b retaining it as a complement to Flann Mainistrech's metrical king-lists. On the other hand, close comparison of the two recensions (or of b with the Reim Rigraide in general) reveals significant differences between them, b sometimes contradicting m and m ignoring the patterns and arguments set forth in b. These are often obscured by the very structure of m, and by interpolations from other sources. Once again, we are safer recognizing the two tracts as distinct interpretations of a common tradition and attempting to reconstruct it on the basis of their agreement, rather than interpreting one in terms of the other. This reconstruction will not, of course, yield the text of ow, but may give us an idea of what it was about. Reconstruction from the extant recensions of LG thus shows that cW com- prised versions of all three canonical tracts, though in brief and rudimentary form. The bulk of the text treated the origins, wanderings, and filiations of the Gaedil (tract I), and may be summarized as follows. The text begins with the division of the world by the three sons of Noah, and the pedigree of Feinius Farsaid, the Scythian ancestor of the Gaedil and de- scendant of Gomer son of Japheth, who witnessed the building and abandon- ment of Nimrod's tower.9 Feinius had two sons, Noenual (variously spelled), who succeeded him as king of Scythia, and N61, who was invited to Egypt because of his great learning and given Pharaoh's daughter Scotta in marriage. Ninus son of Belus took the kingship of the world at that time, 42 (Y) or 62 (b) years after Babel.'0 Nel's son, Gaedel Glass, is the ancestor of the Gaedil. They dwelt in Egypt until the drowning of Pharaoh in the Red Sea, then fled to Scythia in four ships with 24 couples in each. They struggled with the descendants of Noenual for a long time over the Scythian kingship until finally, having slain Refl6ir, 9Recensions p and b disagree over the pedigree and activities of Feinius, b arguing that a remote ancestor of his, Riphath Scott, witnessed the building of the tower. Since this version refers disparagingly to the other and recognizes the half-millennium postulated by Eusebius but not by the Bible between Babel and the Exodus, I accept p's version as original. These chronological differences between p and b are discussed at length in part I (pp 125ff) and below. The story of Feinius, the Tower of Babel, and the origins of the Irish language had independent currency in Irish tradition. Versions of it survive in the Auraicept na ntces, ed. George Calder (Edinburgh 1917), 11 1-46, 104ff; in the introduction to the Senchus Mdr, ed. John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, Ancient Laws of Ireland, vol. I (Dublin 1865), 20ff, and Daniel A.

"'Only b appears to have recognized the significance of this synchronism, which appears in that recension right after the pedigree of F6inius.

From the singing of the sirens on the Caspian Sea Caicher the druid rescued them by stuffing wax into their ears; at the Riphaean Mountains, he prophesied their advent to Ireland." They settled for a while on the Sea of Azov, then sailed into the Mediterranean, past Crete and Sicily to Spain, which they took by force. On the way, they fought 54 battles and defeated the Frisians (b) or Tuscans (p), Langobards, and 'Bachra'.12 Bregon(d), the son of Brath, founded Brigantia (Braganqa) and built a tower, from which Ireland was seen one winter's night. (Here follows a summary of tract II). The Milesians invaded Ireland to avenge ith, the son of Bregon and uncle (in b great-uncle) of Mil Espafine; 36 (in b 40) named chieftains and 24 named servitors led the invasion, which landed at Inber Scene (the Shannon estuary).13 Erem6n mac Miled sailed to the north-east of Ireland, landing at Inber Colptha (the Boyne estuary),14 and his brother Eber remained in the south. The populption-groups descended from them, from their brother ir, and from Lugaid mac itha are variously listed.'5 trem6n and Eber quarrelled over the kingship of Ireland, which was therefore divided between them. Some credit them with twelve chieftains. Concerning the history of the Gaedil, Raigne mac Ugaini composed poem LXXVI, which follows.16 (Here follows a primitive version of tract III.) This reconstruction of tract I bears an extraordinary resemblance to the testimony of 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel' by Mael Muru Othna (ob. 887), but neither appears to be based directly on the other.'7 The two agree not only on the sequence of the narrative and its general outlines but on such minute details as the itinerary from Scythia to Spain (which can only have "IAccording to w and its sources, Scythia lay to the east of the Caspian Sea. The Riphaean Mountains were conceived of as the source of the river Don, which flows into the Sea of Azov. I discuss this itinerary in detail below. 12The matter summarized in this sentence must have been a marginal note in w, entered differently in p (whence m and a) and a (whence b, where it splits up a sentence); a omits the 54 battles, however. I do not know who the Bachra are (Barchu in a), and the other names give little context for speculation. 13The names of the chiefs follow in a385, of the servitors in a385 and b424. In p, however, they are divided into two groups led by lrem6n and lber when they colonize the north and the south, and are only named then (m466f., a397 and 402); a thus names them twice. I discuss Inber Sc6ne below; see especially note 38. 14For the location of Inber Colptha see Edmund Hogan, Onomasticon Goedelicum (Dublin 1910), s.n. Inber Colpa. "Because the companies led by Lrem6n and fEber include ir and Lugaid respectively, their descendants are listed by p along with the members of each company; descendants of Erem6n and Eber themselves follow.

"'This poem, 'A meic iin iUgaine' has not been edited properly, Macalister simply tran- scribing and translating the copy in LL.

On the other hand, the poem sets forth details of the Milesian invasion found otherwise (if at all) only in a - the interviews with triu, Banba and F6tla, flight (beyond the ninth wave) from the Tuatha De Danann, circumstances surrounding the drown- ing of Donn, and more names - but omits such matter in cw as the Scythian kinstrife, Caicher and the sirens, and various genealogical and chronological details. Milesian dealings with their predecessors are particularly remark- able: after losing all but one of their women to the Picts - a variant of the story added to p and I (tract III(A)) - the Milesians form a mar- riage-alliance with the Tuatha De Danann, giving them half of Ireland in return for wives, and also make peace with the Fir Bolg.19 Clearly Mael Muru's sources did not include tract II. We must therefore postulate an Old-Irish text as the source for wc and the poem, which separately added to it from other common and divergent sources. A likely environment for this kind of parallel growth, as Macalister claimed about the recensions of LG itself, would have been monastic schools.20 Other early references to the Milesian legend reinforce this impression. Citations of the eighth-century MS, Cin Dromma Snechtai, which enter LG at 6, present variant testimony about parts of the canon joining it at c:21 the adventures of Parthol6n (F167 and Y175; also Y223), the Fir Bolg (F244 and Y259), and an antediluvian Banba (F167 and Y175) who survives the Flood to challenge the sons of Mil (F390); their more violent encounter at Sliab Mis with an army made by Eriu out of turves (F392 and IsThe poem, pXIII:20-5, and b130 add to this itinerary a reference to 'Muir Libis' or 'Liuis' and 'Coronis', which Macalister tentatively interprets as the Libyan Sea and the nearby island of Cercina (LGE, II, 138), but these have no place in an itinerary extending from the Caspian Sea northwards. In poem LXXVI, however, these names appear along a westward journey from the Caspian to Spain, and may have been associated with the Caspian itself by later readers. According to Mael Muru (LL III:16041f.), Gaedel Glass died at Coronis in Muir Libis; so also does the mysterious Glass son of Agno(ma)n in gXIII:21. This evidence suggests that Mael Muru knew LXXVI and Gilla Coemiin Mael Muru's poem. '"The cession of half of Ireland to the Tuatha D6 Danann recalls Mesca Ulad, in which Amargen grants them the underground half of Ireland ('in leth ro boi sis d'Herind') and the Milesians the surface (ed. J. Carmichael Watson (Dublin 1941), 1); cf. also De Gabdil in tSida, ed. Vernam Hull, ZCP 19 (1933), 53-8. 20Macalister envisions such schools at work on what I call p and a, and thus accounts for the relationship between them (LGE, I, xxxii-xxxiii). 21'See part I, note 46 (p. 95). 1 accept here Gerard Murphy's argument that Baile Chuind Chttchathaig, one of the texts said to derive from that MS, does not in fact contain a reference to Niall Gluindub (CLIII, reg. 916-19), and thus does not stand in the way of assigning the same date to the MS as to the language of its surviving contents ('On the dates of two sources used in Thurneysen's Heldensage', friu 16 (1952), 145-51). For a more recent discussion of this and other issues relating to that MS, see S6amus Mac Mathurna (ed.), Immram Brain (Tiibingen 1985), 421-69. Needless to say, the argument for an eighth-century MS of that name (as opposed to a later collection of eighth-century texts) owes more to Occam's Razor than to any positive evidence. Certainly the wayward nature of the testimony cited in LG fits into the picture of a tradition as yet unfixed by the canon, and thus early.</page><page sequence="10">10 R. MARK SCOWCROFT D414).22 One copy of Cormac's Glossary attaches this last tradition to Banba, and a gloss on Fiacc's Hymn, before becoming illegible, prepares us for some such hostile encounter with all three eponymous goddesses; even b412 surrounds Banba with 'armies made by magic and artifice' ('cona sluagaib druidechta 7 amainsechta').23 What looks like a portion of this putative LG survives in a fragment attributed by LL to Cin Dromma Snechtai, and in a fuller form in L.24 This text describes the 'kindred of Japheth' as originating in Greece rather than Scythia, and as making no stop in Spain on their two-year journey from Egypt to Ireland. Their need for wives is satisfied by a group of Hebrew women driven previously to Ireland by a storm, who demand compensation for the abandonment of their home- land; in this payment originates the custom of bride-price without dowry (this anecdote about the Hebrew women is what survives also in LL). Elements common to, this tract and LG include the Milesians' descent from Japheth, their presence as exiles in Egypt when Pharaoh drowns in the Red Sea, his daughter Scotta (though as Eber's wife),25 the subsequent migration to Ireland, supernatural resistance to their landing, which is eventually ac- complished at Inber Sc6ne,26 and the reckoning of twelve (unnamed) lords 22The paragraph in D414 goes on to reproduce the text in a392 that precedes the passage from Cin Dromma Snechtai in f (F392, c439): evidence that these citations were marginal additions to 6. The main text from a392 is identified by a marginal note in D as 'slicht libuir eli ... .i. Lebur na hUidri'. If we are to trust this statement, 6 must have been part of that codex, the principal scribe of which died in 1106. For other references to Lebor na hUidre in D see part I, note 46 (p. 95). 23Until all copies of Cormac's Glossary are brought together in a critical edition, and con- clusions drawn about their interrelationships, one must suspect the genuineness of a passage found in one version only; this appears in the Yellow Book of Lecan (ed. Meyer, §1265) but not in LL (ed. Stokes), and may thus be a later addition to Cormac's text. In the gloss to Fiacc's Hymn, five eponyms for Ireland are named (the conventional three plus Faiil and Elca), and a story begins to unfold about the Milesians' advance on Sliab Mis, where they see a host of birds with wings outstretched (an Otherworld motif?). Great fear seizes someone (them, I assume); a woman approaches and speaks (ed. Whitley Stokes and John Strachan, Thesaurus Palaeohibernicus, vol. II (Cambridge 1903), 307-21, gloss to 1. 60). The sinister portent of this fragment recalls the Cin Dromma Snechtai tradition more than LG itself (except for b412). These glosses, assigned by their editors to the eleventh century, also include the etymology of Temair (1. 20), the story of the Gaedil at the Tower of Babel (1.35, as in p), the nations descended from the Milesians (1. 37, as in o), and eponyms for the Feni and the Gaedil (1. 40, as in w). 24See Vernam Hull, 'The Milesian invasion of Ireland', ZCP 19 (1933), 155-60. 25Cf. the interpolation in Saltair na Rann (ed. Whitley Stokes (Oxford 1883), 11 3993-4012), which portrays her as the wife of Gaedel; they flee the wrath of Pharaoh as the Israelites cross the Red Sea, and sail first to Ceylon and thence to the Caspian (I discuss this conventional itinerary below). In b126, the same pair apparently lead the expedition, but no version of LG describes them as man and wife. Two Scottas appear of course in ft, one the wife of N61 and the other the wife of Mil, subsequently inherited (in 6) by trem6n (F387, D419). This epony- mous ancestress became traditional no doubt before her precise identity and role were fixed. She also appears in one copy of Cormac's Glossary (ed. Meyer, §1162). 26LG describes two kinds of resistance: the shaping of the coast into headlands so that the Milesians could find no harbour until they sailed into Inber Scene (F386, b4l1), and the magical wind (gaeth druad) raised against them when they sailed out again beyond the ninth wave (a394, b415; in the latter, they return to Inber Scene). The tract from Cin Dromma Snechtai calls their enemy 'indeiltre' and 'indelltre', which is glossed as '.i. in d6 draideachta' ('god of druidism'?, 'druidic mist'?); the term is cited in the Dictionary of the Irish Language as (in) deiltre, but remains unexplained.</page><page sequence="11">LEABHAR GABHALA 11 and 24 servitors accompanying tremon and Eber; the names of the servitors differ from those in w, but have been added to m464. Once again we discover a series of corresponding details combined with others in significant dis- agreement, and the likelihood of original unity, separate development, and late intertextual contact. The testimony attributed to Cin Dromma Snechtai, if genuine and accur- ately dated, reinforces the implication of Mael Muru's poem and other early (if fragmentary) sources, that the LG tradition was current in the Old- Irish period, not just in the form I have reconstructed but in other versions as well; indeed, we shall see that the dramatis personae of co appear in genealogical poetry of the seventh century. Testimony first accruing to a, fP, or 6, moreover, survives in tracts otherwise more primitive than co, along with claims quite foreign to LG as a whole. We must therefore distinguish the canon from the tradition it gradually absorbs or supersedes. For the one but not the other we can establish lines of development and a relative chronology. It is the oldest sources that manifest the greatest deviation from this canon, while the later tend to conform to it, rendering the dis- tinction for the most part irrelevant by the end of the Middle-Irish period. Such deviations deserve careful study, therefore, if we are to understand the canon as a product of its traditional matrix. Although the relevant passages in Historia Brittonum are particularly im- portant in this respect, they have long suffered vague or Procrustean analysis as a primitive LG, the crucial distinction between the tradition and its final formulation being obscured by a tendency to correct or ignore testimony at odds with the canon. Concerning the origins of the Gaedil, Nennius says only that a (nameless) Scythian nobleman, expelled from his homeland, fled Egypt in the aftermath of the Exodus, travelling westward to Spain where his descendants dwelt for close to a millennium before colonizing Ireland. We shall see that this exiguous narrative, as Partholonian or Nemetian as it is Milesian, sheds a great deal of light on the origins of the canon and the tradition as a whole, as does the puzzling version of tract II, which receives detailed analysis below. It is as an independent expression of the tradition, however, rather than an early recension of the canon that this testimony proves most valuable. The distinction I have made between a fecund, somewhat amorphous tradition and the canonical version of it, though resembling what we assume distinguishes oral from written tradition, does not predicate separate redac- tions from an oral culture as such except insofar as medieval Irish scholars, like ourselves, engaged in oral transmission while learning, teaching, or composing from memory. We shall see that the subject-matter of this tradi- tion is also quintessentially scholarly, based to an overwhelming degree on written sources and in the end resembling more the work of Nennius or Geoffrey of Monmouth than the Old-Irish sagas. Mael Muru Othna's poem, which diverges from the canon as significantly as any other source, shows such detailed and consistent correspondence to it that their relationship can only be ultimately textual, and more than one recension of LG has borrowed</page><page sequence="12">12 R. MARK SCOWCROFT directly from the poem since. The analogues from Historia Brittonum and Cin Dromma Snechtai, though not so closely related to LG as the poem, manifest a similar combination of detailed, even minute agreement with startling divergence, which hardly recalls the free variation of storytelling, a form we expect to be less precisely but more generally consistent. I would argue, then, that the agreement of our sources results from a standard of accuracy (or doctrine) fundamentally textual - if not from written records themselves - combined with a mythopoeic faculty closer to the composition of saga than to modern historiography. LG and its tradition exemplify the fusion of two cultures, the literati using medieval scholarly techniques to convert native tradition into historiography and native mytho- poeic techniques to convert biblical and scholarly sources into narrative; the authors of LG may thus claim equal descent from Isidore of Seville and the ancient filid. To an examination of their work, therefore, it is legitimate to bring methods of analysis addressed both to the historical evolution of the canon and to the ahistorical patterns of this new mythology. TRACT I AND MEDIEVAL LEARNING Medieval Irish historians and genealogists frequently posit eponymous ancestors for national and familial groups, as do the authors of Ireland's toponymic legends (the dindsenchas) eponymous founders for place- names. Hence, for example, Conn Cetchathach (XCIX), eponym and (pos- sibly historical) ancestor-figure for Ireland's northern half (Leth Cuinn), its predominant dynastic group (Sil Cuinn), and the Connachta;27 Eochu Mumo (XII), eponym of Munster (a510); or the five Lugaids, bearing epi- thets abstracted from the Calraige Connacht, Corpraige, DAl Coirpre Cliach, Corco Oircthi, and Corco Laegde, which they are said to have foun- ded (m467, a404, b427); hence the many personages introduced into LG only to bequeath their names to places, like Annind, son of Nemed and eponym of Loch nAnnind (a238, b250), or Colptha, son of Mil and first to land at Inber Colptha (m466, a404). This probably native habit was reinfor- ced and extended following the example of Isidore of Seville, whose Etymo- logiarum (sive Originum) Libri XX so often go beyond eponymy into more complex forms of etymological analysis.28 One can thus improve on the 27Since the naming of dynasties after an ancestor was as common a habit in the early medieval period as eponymy, the historicity of a personage like Conn C6tchathach remains doubtful; see Francis J. Byrne, Irish Kings and High-Kings (London 1973), 52f., for a forceful discussion of the problem. T. F. O'Rahilly sees Conn as another avatar of the Otherworld god (Early Irish History and Mythology (Dublin 1946) - hereafter EIHM - 281ff), while Alwyn and Brinley Rees derive him from the common noun conn in Leth Cuinn, 'the chief's half', as opposed to Leth Moga, 'the slave's half', which similarly generated a personage called Mog Nuadat (see Celtic Heritage (London 1961), 101 f., and note 131 below). 28All citations of this work are from the edition of W. M. Lindsay (Oxford 1911). For early references illustrating the tremendous importance of Isidore and the Etymologiae in medieval Ireland see Tomas 0 MAille, 'The authorship of the Culmen', Eriu 9 (1921-3), 71-6, and for an enlightening discussion of the nature of Isidorean etymology, and some examples of its use in Irish texts, see Rolf Baumgarten, 'A Hiberno-Isidorian etymology', Peritia 2 (1983), 225-8. Though 6 Maille's estimate for the date at which the Etymologiae reached Ireland rests on an</page><page sequence="13">LEABHAR GABHALA 13 simple story of F6tla, Banba, and Elriu (a390-2, b412), interpreting F6tla as the phrase 'f6t for Dil' ('a sod upon Dil') - one element of which generates a daughter of Mil, buried and so memorialized by Erem6n (m465, a395) - and Ireland (Eriu) as 'ab heroibus nominata' (m101).29 Temair, though in origin a common noun, becomes Tea-muir, i.e. mur Tea 'the rampart of Tea', daughter of Lugaid mac Itha (a396, b423).30 In Cess/Noinden Ulad, Emain Machae is understood to mean 'the twins of [the Otherworld woman] Machae' - a fairly straightforward interpretation31 - while in LG it be- comes to-muin Machae, 'the gold neck-brooch of [the Ulidian queen] Machae', with which she etched its outline in the ground.32 This type of Isidorean etymology becomes, needless to say, a major stimulus to narrative design. Such personages as Feinius, Gaedel, and Scotta, therefore, no less than Er, trannin, Brittan Mael, or the three goddesses, could arise spontane- ously at any time to inaugurate their namesakes:33 Feni 6 Fenius asbertar brig cen dochta Gaedil 6 Gaediul Glas garta Scuitt 6 Scotta. By the same token, Irish tradition preserves numerous origin-legends and other mythological or pseudo-historical narratives older than or independ- ent of LG, some of which eventually accrued to it. Its purpose from the beginning, however, was not to collect native traditions as such but to find a place for Ireland in the biblical history of the world, for her inhabitants ahistorical source - Do Iallsigud Tina B6 Cualnige, which portrays Senchan Torpeist (ob. 657) referring to the culmen (its Irish nickname) - he cannot be wide of the mark, as we shall see. About the entry for 618 in the Annals of Tigernach, which O'Rahilly reads as 'scribend in Chulmin' (Eriu 10 (1926-8), 109), I can only say that the use of that epithet betrays an annalist familiar with the work and its reputation in Ireland, and thus writing sometime after that date. The Etymologiae are thought to have been written between 622 and 633. 29Multiple etymologies are common in the tradition, and are seen to be complementary rather than contradictory, etymology having more a pluralist, philosophical purpose than a strictly scientific one (see Baumgarten, 'Hiberno-Isidorian etymology', 226). 30This etymology appears also (among others) in Cormac's Glossary (ed. Meyer, §1212; Stokes, p. 42), and in 'Temair Breg, cid ni diata', ed. E. J. Gwynn, The Metrical Dindienchas, Todd Lecture Series (TLS), vols VIII-XII (Dublin 1903-35), I, 2-5; c comprises this poem (as LXXXI), but Macalister does not edit it. 3 See Vernam Hull, 'Noinden Ulad: the debility of the Ulidians', Celtica 8 (1968), 1-42. The feminine i-stem Emain is thus interpreted as the plural of the masculine o-stem emon. 32See the discussion of tract III(C) in part 1, 121f. 'This etymology also appears in Cormac's Glossary (ed. Meyer, §502; Stokes, p. 17) 33'After F&amp;inius the Feni are named - a sense unsecret - the Gaedil after generous Gaedel Glass, the Scotti after Scotta.' This verse appears in LG as aX but originates in 'Can a mbuna- dus na nGaedel' (LL III:16025f.). The name F6inius, despite its Latinate look, is a masculine u-stem of a common type, based on a word for the Irish used particularly in legal and other scholarly contexts (see notes 9 and 55). To these three eponyms A. G. van Hamel would add N61 as a derivative of the name for medieval Ireland's foremost dynasty, the Ui N6ill; the Nile may also have played a part ('On Lebor Gabala', ZCP 10 (1915), 143). Though N61 (g. s. Niuil) remains everywhere distinct from Niall Noigiallach, that dynasty's traditional ances- tor/eponym, O'Rahilly believes the latter's name an assimilation of original NIl to the -giall- of his epithet, which memorializes the nine hostages (gtill, n. s. giall) rendered to him by the peoples he conquered in historical legend (EIHM, 232f.).</page><page sequence="14">14 R. MARK SCOWCROFT among the descendants of Noah, and for her many nations and dynasties in an immense genealogical scheme that subsumed their pedigrees and claims under those of the Tara kingship. Essential to these efforts were the standard authorities on chronology, geography, history, ethnography, and language, who had already brought the Old Testament, classical scholarship, and early medieval thought into some sort of harmony. The Irish literati read care- fully, solving the riddle step by step; thus did LG germinate and take root in Irish tradition. In the Historiarum adversum Paganos Libri VII, written in c. 417, Paulus Orosius thus describes Ireland:34 Hibernia insula inter Britanniam et Hispaniam sita longiore ab Africo in boream spatio porrigitur. huius partes priores intentae Cantabrico oceano Brigantiam Gallaeciae ciuitatem ab Africo sibi in circium occurrentem spatioso interuallo procul spectant, ab eo praecipue promunturio, ubi Scenae fluminis ostium est et Velabri Lucenique consistunt. haec propior Britanniae, spatio terrarum angustior, sed caeli solique temperie magis utilis, a Scottorum genti- bus colitur (I.2.80f.). Quoting part of this passage in the Etymologiae (XIV.vi.3), Isidore says that Ireland is called Hibernia because of its proximity to (H)iberia:35 hence, according to the rule of eponymy observed above, the Irish would have reason to believe that their ancestors came from Spain. The passage is easily understood to claim that Brigantia was visible from Ireland, and recalls Orosius' earlier description of that angulus of three-cornered Spain 'ubi Brigantia Gallaeciae ciuitas sita altissimam pharum et inter pauca memor- andi operis ad speculam Britanniae erigit' (I.2.71);36 Britain and Ireland are 'in auersa Galliarum parte ad prospectum Hispaniae sitae' (1.2.75). The pharus at Brigantia appears in LG as Bregon's tower - Bregon(d) being another eponym37 - from the top of which ith first saw Ireland (c379). 34All citations of this work are from the edition of Carolus Zangemeister, Corpus Script. Eccles. Lat., vol. V (Vindobonae 1882). Arguments presented here about the use of Orosius and Isidore by the authors of LG include a selection and revision of those set forth by Heinrich Zimmer in Nennius Vindicatus (Berlin 1893), 224n., and more fully developed by van Hamel in 'On Lebor Gabaila', 97-197. 3"For a detailed discussion of these passages in Orosius and Isidore (and the adaptation of the latter as an introduction for m), see Rolf Baumgarten, 'The geographical orientation of Ireland in Isidore and Orosius', Peritia 3 (1984), 189-203. The description of Ireland in ml01 as 'insola occasus' probably derives from Isidore's remarks on the island of Tanatos somewhere nearby (XIV.vi.3). The initial h- in Hibernia and (H)iberia would not have been pronounced by Isidore or his Irish readers; -n- is thus the only sound that differentiates the two names. 36Orosius' description of Spain as trigona (1.2.69) is echoed in b131 ('hissin nEspiin tre- uillig'), bXIV: 10d ('isin Espdin n-uillig n-uair'), and IXXXII:3d ('cosin nEspdin tre-uillig'). 37Eochaid ua Floinn interprets the name as Bregond in aLXV, rhyming it with slegoll (1 la/b), and the genitive singular with feraind (10b/d) and trebaind (21a/b). Gilla Coemain prefers Bregon, which rhymes with bailcdremon in pXIII:38c/d, and this is the form employed by a and probably p. The rhyme with trebann in Mael Muru's poem (LL III:16051f.) can be taken either way, the delenition of the final consonant in trebann being secondary to its adaptation from Latin tribunus. The spelling Breogan, preferred by b, c, and many other sources (including, I fear, part I of this essay), results probably from etymological speculation, which survives right down to E6in Mac N6ill's claim that the name means 'the flame-born' (Celtic Ireland (Dublin 1921), 60). Thus does medieval etymology continue into modern times.</page><page sequence="15">LEABHAR GABHALA 15 His avengers (and other invaders) landed at Inber Scene which, as a bor- rowing of Orosius' peculiar spelling for the Shannon ('Scenae fluminis ostium'), was to cause great confusion among the literati.38 Isidore claims that the Gallaeci were Galli originally from Greece (IX.2.110), the descend- ants of Gomer son of Japheth (IX.2.26); hence the Greek associations of several invaders and a Noachic pedigree for the Gaedil.39 Figure 1 displays the doctrines of p and b concerning the genealogy of the Milesians and their predecessors. Omitting Cessair, the ancestry of Par- thol6n, and the Nemetian origin of the Britons (see Fig. 2), and acknowledg- ing alternative pedigrees for Feinius Farsaid and the Scythian kings, m agrees in all other respects with a. In b, Esrfi and Srui (along with the pre- Milesians) directly follow Baath, whom fourteen generations separate from F6inius; those between Srai (grandson of Gaedel) and Brath, on the other hand, are omitted entirely.40 These complementary expansions of what looks like a common original, though relatively late in the evolution of LG, reflect genealogical traditions as old as the seventh century. Two archaic poems on the kings of Leinster, 'Nuadu Necht ni dimair anhaith' and 'Enna Labraid luad ciich', comprise the generations added to both p and b, the authors of which apparently made independent and selective additions 38Several MSS of Orosius' text omit the -c-, which may thus originate in scribal error; if so, the correct reading would correspond in every way but gender to Ptolemy's (g. s.) oqvov (see O'Rahilly, EIHM, I ff, for a discussion of Ptolemy's geography of Ireland). Baumgarten argues that the error was conditioned by etymological speculation associating the name with Latin sc(a)ena 'scene, background, stage', which would be understood as a reference to the pro- montory next to it in Orosius' description ('Geographical orientation', 201f.); perhaps the headlands thrown up by the Tuatha De Danann against the Milesian landing are also relevant here (see note 26). For a collection of attempts by the literati to locate Inber Sc6ne see Hogan, Onomasticon, 459; b411 supplants it with Inber Slaine (Wexford Harbour), mentioning Inber Scene only as an alternative. It is confirmed as the reading of w, however, by a386, bXIV:16, the reference in m467 to the death of f-rannan 'in palude Scenae', the drowning of its eponym in a386 and b419, and its subsequent use as an embarkation point in b415 and b418; Mael Muru describes the Milesians landing there after their voyage out beyond the ninth wave (LL III: 16093f.). Parthol6n lands there in a199 (b says nothing), as does Nemed in F237 and bXL. These are apparently the three invaders to whom LL199 refers when saying that Ireland was invaded three times from Inber Scene ('uair fo thri rogabad Heriu a Hinbiur Sc6ine'). 39Isidore expands on the interrelationships of the Galli, Galatae, and Gallograeci in IX.ii.68. Parthol6n comes to Ireland from Greek territory in aXXI:6, flXXXII:2, and b209; Nemed originates among the Greeks of Scythia in a166 and a237 (b says nothing), and the Fir Bolg flee to Greece in a244, b259, and %XLI:26; the Tuatha D&amp; Danann are discovered there in b321f. The Gaedil are, in Mael Muru's poem, descendants of the Greeks (LL III:16005f.), and in the tract from Cin Dromma Snechtai exiles from Greek territory (see note 24). 40I have tried in Fig. I to reproduce original rather than corrected spellings but have con- firmed several (and have supplied some marks of length) by referring to other texts. Noenual and Alld6it have been selected from a host of variants, several of them confirmed by rhyme; Foenius appears for F6inius sometimes, as does Agn6n for Agnoman; and a few of the rarer names, which confused the authors of LG as much as they do me, appear here with a repre- sentative spelling. Forms followed by an asterisk remain in the genitive singular, and optional letters and names are enclosed in parentheses. Lineages appearing in only one recension or paragraph are so marked. Two Scythian kings, Baath and the second Noenual, appear in m113 and a109 but not in p110 or pXIII - they are also omitted by b - so may be later additions.

Given descent from Gomer and the choice among these three, the literati adopted Riphath perhaps because the wanderings of the Gaedil, as we shall see, took them through the Montes Riphaei. The Sex Aetates Mundi has certainly made this connection, locat- ing there the Paphlagonian descendants of Riphath.42 The reading in p and 'Nuadu Necht' appears to have resulted from the confusion of this pedigree for Feinius with an alternative found in m102, the Sex Aetates Mundi (§25), and Auraicept na nEces (11 179-81), which describes him as the grandson of Magog, whose two sons were Baath and Ibath.43 From Magog descend the pre-Milesians in p and the Scythians and Goths in Isidore (IX.ii.27): hence no doubt the form Magoth in a, by etymological association with the Gothi. All versions of LG (and Nennius and Mael Muru) agree that the Gaedil came from Scythia, apparently because of the resemblance between Latin Scotti (Irish Scuitt) and Scythae; the derivation of the one from the other would follow the pattern of Hibernia and Iberia.44 For information about Scythia the literati also relied on Orosius and Isidore, whose works inspired the itineraries in tract I. Orosius locates the Scythians east of the Caspian Sea (1.2.47), which he describes as follows:45 Mare Caspium sub Aquilonis plaga ab oceano oritur, cuius utraque circa oceanum litora et loca deserta incultaque habentur. inde meridiem uersus per 41The poems are edited with a translation by Kuno Meyer, Oiber die dilteste irische Dichtung, Abhandl. der k6nigl. preuss.

Hildegard Tristram (Tiibingen 1988), 39-58). 42All citations of this text are from the edition of Daibhi 0 Cr6inin, The Irish Sex Aetates Mundi (Dublin 1983), hereafter SAM; see §25. The descent of the Paphlagonians from Riphath derives from Isidore (IX.ii.33). Since they dwelt in Asia Minor, while the Montes Riphaei belonged somewhere in northern Russia (see below), only etymological speculation could con- nect them. See van Hamel, 'On Lebor Gabala', 173. 43In m102, this Ibath son of Magog is the ancestor of the Romans, who figure among his descendants in SAM, §25; Feinius son of Baath is the ancestor of the Scythians and Goths. The Auraicept supplements this version of his pedigree with an alternative that slightly expands that in b16 (see Calder (ed.), 11 181-6). 44See van Hamel, 'On Lebor Gabala', 173. One is tempted to see a closer phonetic cor- respondence - Scuitt as the Irish representation of both Scotti and *Scythi (with an aspirated -t-) - but the latter is normally spelled by LG with a lenited -t- (exceptions in LL9 and the list of languages in a107 are probably scribal variants). The phonetic correspondence does not in any case have to be that close, as 'Scotti ... quasi scissi' (ml01) shows. See Baumgarten, 'Hiberno- Isidorian etymology'. 4'According to Isidore, this territory is only a small part of the Scythians' former home (XIV.iii.31f.), and classical writers generally use 'Scythia' to mean the area north-east of the Black Sea.</page><page sequence="18">18 R. MARK SCOWCROFT longas angustias tenditur, donec per magna spatia dilatatum Caucasi montis radicibus terminetur (I.2.48). Since this northern ocean, to which the Caspian Sea is connected, is only a part of the great ocean that encircles the known world, the Gaedil could sail from Egypt to Scythia by way of the Red Sea, India, Ceylon, and the eastern and northern oceans; Nemed could sail from the Caspian Sea into the northern ocean and west to Ireland.46 Orosius continues: itaque a mari Caspio quod est ad orientem, per oram oceani septentrionalis usque ad Tanaim fluuium [the river Don] et Maeotidas paludes [the Sea of Azov] quae sunt ad occasum, per litus Cimmerici maris [here the Black Sea] quod est ab Africo, usque ad caput et portas Caucasi quae sunt ad meridiem, gentes sunt XXXIIII. sed generaliter regio proximo Albania, ulterior sub mari et monte Caspio Amazonum nominatur (I.2.49f.). This passage must have inspired the strange voyage of the Gaedil from Scythia to Spain by way of the northern ocean, Sliab Riphi - the Montes Riphaei at the source of the Tanais (1.2.4), in LG located right on the ocean shore - the Gaethlaige Meotecda (presumably by way of the Tanais), and the Black and Mediterranean Seas.47 The author of this itinerary would have interpreted Orosius' description of the eastern and western boundaries of this area as a route from east to west. We see here also the likely inspir- ation for the claim in m114 that Brith set out on this journey 'from the eastern Albania' (assin[d] Albain airtheraig). The Irish form of the Latin Albania (Albain) is homonymous with oblique forms of the name for Britain (Albu, dative and accusative singular Albain), and in a9 both 'Albo' and one group of 'Albanaig' are derived from Albanus, a descendant of Gomer; in the Sex Aetates Mundi (§25) he is the eponym for 'the eastern Albania in great Asia' (ind Albain airtherach issind Assia m6ir). In a similar way, Isidore's identification of a Caucasian (H)iberia (XIV.iii.33, 36) - in b409 Mil's homeland - must have recalled to the Irish literati their Spanish associations. In addition to Scotti and Scythae, therefore, we find Gallaeci and Galatae (both considered Galli, descendants of Gomer), Albu and Albain (fused by patrimony and common oblique forms), and the two Iber- 46For itineraries of the Gaedil from Egypt to Scythia see b126, b130, and their return trips in bl127, bXIV:3, and b409 (p gives no details of the trip). The same itinerary appears in 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel' (LL 11I:16037-40) and the Saltair na Rann interpolation (11 4001-12). Nemed's trip from the Caspian north and west to Ireland is described in a237 and b248; the origins of the Tuatha D1 Danann in the 'northern islands of the world' (p304, b320) may also be relevant here. 47This itinerary belonged in o (pu11-14, pXIII:20-33, bl30f.), and also appears in 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel' (LL 111:16041-8); it is the model for Cessair's wanderings in P from the Nile to the Caspian and thence to the Black and Mediterranean Seas (on 'Muir Torrian' as the Mediterranean, see Zimmer, Nennius Vindicatus, 217n.), to Sliab nElpa (the Alps?), a 'corner of Spain' (see note 36), and Ireland (F169, b176, #XXIII). In bl30f., the text of w has been elaborated and merged with another itinerary, possibly like that of Nemed, past Germany (at the top of which Isidore locates the Montes Riphaei in XIV.viii.8), Belguint (Belgium?), and Breguint (Brigantia?) to Spain; this may explain the battles against the Frisians and Langobards in b 132 (for the location of the latter see Isidore, IX.ii.95; j116 has Tuscans instead of Frisians; both versions include Bachra (Barchu in a), which I cannot place).

While the Scythian origins of the Gaedil are first attested in Nennius, the Spanish origin-legend, if indeed based on Isidore's Etymologiae, must have taken root in Ireland as soon as that work became available there, for Mil, Bregon(d), and Gom6r - respectively the miles Hispaniae of Nennius, the eponym for Orosius' Brigantia, and Isidore's ancestor for the Gallaeci - appear in the Leinster genealogical poems.48 Mil is particularly noteworthy in this respect because the name derives from a Latin phrase, and thus from a Latin document composed between the appearance of the Etymologiae in Ireland and the composition of the Leinster poems (in their extant form). This text could even have been the source used by Nennius, whose 'tres filii militis Hispaniae' makes perfect sense as 'three sons of a Spanish soldier'. In any case, the Milesian legend, if not the elaborated testimony of Historia Brittonum, was established before the end of the seventh century. The names of these tres filii, though as old and as important as Mil or Bregon(d), are less easy to explain. Eremon appears as an ancestral figure in three archaic poems, and paired with Eber in the eighth-century Fiacc's Hymn; Mael Muru Othna first names the third as Ir.49 Though other sons cleave to Mil, the kings and kindreds of the Gaedil were still traced to these three, and van Hamel interprets them as eponyms for Ireland itself: trem6n for triu, tber for Iber(n)ia, and ir for Anglo-Saxon or Old-Norse Ir(a)land.5so O'Rahilly accepts the first two equations but substitutes iriu, 48See note 41; 'Enna Labraid' also comprises a metrical list of languages culled from the Etymologiae, XIV.iii.-vi (for a comparison of this list with the versions in LG see Macalister, LGE, II, 150ff). It is conceivable, of course, that information here credited to Isidore came to the Irish literati from other, earlier sources; the descendants of Gomer and Magog, for example, appear in St Jerome's Liber Quaestionum Hebraicarum in Genesim (see 0 Cr6inin's notes to SAM, §25). But the Etymologiae bring together so much relevant knowledge at the right time, earning a unique reputation in medieval Ireland (see note 28), that Occam's Razor once again excludes other, less obvious sources, at least until further, much needed research is done on this problem. 49 For i-rem6n as ancestor, see 'Nuadu Necht', 'Enna Labraid', and 'MWen 6en 6 ba n6ed', which refers to Ireland as 'iath nEremoin' (ed. O'Brien, CGH, 4, 6, 1 respectively; the last is also edited with a translation by Meyer, Alt. ir. Dicht., II, 9-12 (v. 3), and by Carney in 'The dating of archaic Irish verse'). The pagan Irish are called 'maice Ebir maicc Erimon [sic]' in Fiacc's Hymn, 1. 37, and the pair are also singled out in F108 and the tract from Cin Dromma Snechtai (see note 24). Ir and three others join them in 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel' (LL III: 16061f.), the relationship between which and w pushes this doctrine further back. O'Rahilly argues that when the two ancestors became three, Ir acquired descendants from Eber along with a doublet of lber himself (EIHM, 196). The five Lugaids mentioned above descend from a fourth personage, Lugaid mac itha, but he nowhere enjoys the prominence of the other three. 50'On Lebor Gabala', 174f. I have been unable to find examples of what he calls the 'usual' Hiberno-Latin form Eberia for Iberia - still less O'Rahilly's Eberus, Ebernus, or Hi-bernus (EIHM, 195) - but C6ir Anmann presents one Eber M6r as king of Spain, and the river Ebro (Latin Iberus) as 'sruth Ebir' (ed. W. Stokes, Irische Texte, III.ii (Leipzig 1897), §38). O'Rahilly's examples of the equation from Minigud Senchais Ebir and O'Mulconry's Glos- sary are of an Isidorean type, and hardly support a linguistic argument: 'Eber a quo dicitur Hibernia ut alii putant' (ed. O'Brien, CGH, 186, 1. 147a2); 'Eriu quasi Hebriu ab Hiberia, hoc est ab Hispania' (ed. W. Stokes, Archiv fir celtische Lexicographie, I (Halle 1900), 254, §416; on the use of quasi by Isidore and his followers to introduce a putative intermediary between attested forms, see Baumgarten, 'Hiberno-Isidorian etymology', 226).</page><page sequence="20">20 R. MARK SCOWCROFT 'land', as a source for Ir.51 These derivations are plausible enough after the fact - like Isidorean etymologies - but leave unexplained the forms of trem6n and Eber. Only one personage named fremon appears in the tradi- tion, and the several Ebers remain firmly planted in prehistory. As unique, unusual or purely literary names, therefore, these may have complex origins, and even scribal accident is not out of the question. As far as I know, Eochaid ua Floinn is the first poet to fix them in rhyme.52 If eponyms for Ireland, both have undergone subsequent reformation. trem6n echoes other 'learned names' like Seme6n or Parthol6n (= Bar- tholomaeus), and if altered to do so may derive ultimately from a name like Agnoman (alias Agnon), Boaman, or Ogaman, perhaps ultimately from an n-stem agentive formation.53 Eber has surely been affected by the biblical Heber, and thus acquired its long initial vowel.54 As is obvious to any reader of LG, the history of the Gaedil is based on that of the Israelites, focussing after Noah and Babel on this particular nation, its invitation to Egypt, subsequent exodus, wanderings, return home (to Scythia) and/or colonization of a promised land (Ireland), filiations, and kings. Macalister has shown to what extent the narrative as a whole and some striking details correspond to the Old-Testament prototype, and Feinius's epithet ('the Phar- isee') confirms the analogy in the same way as would the coalescence of Iber(n)ia (Iber(n)us?) and Heber.55 Perhaps indeed we should understand 5TEIHM, 196n. He also imagines a personification of iriu (*Iriu) which he pronounces a doublet of Lriu. His examples of ir- in adjectival compounds modifying triu are suggestive of a productive association, however, and the name ir could certainly be derived from iriu as is Er from £riu. 52See ccLXV:15a-b (Eremn : g:l-med6n) and 47c-d (Ebir : gl-gil); the final syllable of Lrem6n is first established, to my knowledge, in Saltair na Rann, 11 2361f. (16ir : Erim6in). 53The original nominative would thus be *Erem, the genitive singular of which, if spelled Eremon (or Erimon, as in Fiacc's Hymn: see note 49), could be reinterpreted as an o-stem omitting final palatalization. Compare 'Dub-dissirt m. Dass6n' in Rawlinson B 502, p. 155a39 (ed. O'Brien, CGH, 259), and the behaviour of the diminutive suffixes -6in and -en (see R. Thurneysen, A Grammar of Old Irish, tr. D. A. Binchy and Osborn Bergin (Dublin 1946), §280.1). The emergence of new nominatives from old genitives is common throughout the onomastic corpus; see e.g. Ethnenn and Ethlenn as derivatives of Ethne (note 66) and the more complicated relationship between Toe and Taitt (note 172). Though the suffix -6n is relatively rare in Old Irish, its spread was probably encouraged by the example of biblical names (conven- tionally with a long final syllable in Irish) like Abisil6n, Amm6n, Ar6n, Babil6n, or Ebr6n (see Saltair na Rann, passim). 540n Heber, see Genesis XI:14, and Isidore's Etymologiae, IX.ii.5. The Irish form of the name is confirmed by rhyme (with trenfer and glimer) in 'R6dig dam a D6 do nim', by Dublittir ua hUathgaile (fl. 1100), ed. 0 Cr6inin, SAM, §70, verses 66b-c and 79a-b; in the latter, Heber is said to have brought Hebrew from Nimrod's Tower (cf. note 55). 55LGE, I, xxvii-xxviii. Pharisees being teachers of the written and unwritten Jewish law (see e.g. Philippians 111:1-5), it is particularly appropriate that in LL103 F6inius should be identified with the btrla Ftne - the language of the Irish law-tracts - and should run a great school of languages (see also the texts cited in note 9). Isidore derives Pharisaeus from phares, 'divisio' (VII.vi.40, VIII.iv.3); the same meaning is ascribed to the name of Heber's son, Phaleg, because the languages of the world divided during their time (Genesis X:25; Isidore, VII.vi.24).

We have seen how the Irish literati integrated their nation into medieval historiography, geography, and ethnography, and how, these points of con- tact being made, the ancient history of the Gaedil corresponds to that of the Israelites. The comparison implicit in this sustained narrative parallelism is made explicit elsewhere in Irish tradition,57 but subsequent variations on the same pattern of migration, captivity, exodus, and the colonization of a promised land suggest rather a narrative archetype than a deliberate anal- ogy: one of those 'abstract story-patterns' so common (and so important) in early Irish literature.58 Thus, the Nemetians migrate to Ireland, suffer under Fomorian taxation, revolt, and scatter to a number of regions they subsequently inhabit; Eochaid ua Floinn even synchronizes the sack and flooding of Tor Conaind with the Exodus (aXLII:14). The Fir Bolg go to Greece, are enslaved, flee, and return to Ireland (a244, b259-63). They later repeat the pattern in /3, accepting the invitation of Cairpre Nia Fer to dwell in his realm, finding his taxes unbearable, and fleeing to the lands in Conn- acht that still bear their names (F281, b291). Even the Irish theomachy shows traces of this pattern, Cath Maige Tuired and Oidhe Chlainne Tuireann describing the cause of the great battle as the oppression of the Tuatha cording to Augustine, their household preserved Hebrew while it was corrupted at Babel, and thus represents, like Noah's household, the civitas Dei (De Civitate Dei, in Corpus Christianor- um, Series Latina (Turnholti 1954-) - hereafter CCL - vol. XLVIII, XIV.iii and xi). Since LG uses the same metaphor for the origin of languages at Babel (the verb scailid in a103, b17, bV:51a), this meaning of Pharisaeus may also be relevant to F&amp;inius's epithet. Cf. also the pharus at Brigantia in Orosius, 1.2.71. 56See note 24. lber is to be considered leader here because he inherits Scotta, the only woman among the Gaedil, from their previous leader Mil; cf. Urem6n's marriage to her in F387 and D419. She is thus comparable to other eponyms married to Irish kings and symbolic of their sovereignty. On this widespread topos, see Tomas 0 Maille, 'Medb Chruachna', ZCP 17 (1928), 129-46; T. F. O'Rahilly, 'On the origin of the names trainn and Eriu', Eriu 14 (1946), 7-28; and Proinsias Mac Cana, 'Aspects of the theme of king and goddess in Irish literature', Et. celt. 7 (1955-6), 76-114, 356-413; 8 (1958-9), 59-65. This secular symbolism finds a patristic counterpart in Isidore's interpretation of Pharaoh's daughter as the Ecclesia gentium, which receives Christ as she took up Moses (Allegoriae quaedam Sacrae Scripturae, ed. J.-P. Migne, Patrologia Latina (Parisiis 1841-64)- hereafter PL - vol. LXXXIII, coll. 97ff, §58). We may thus understand Scotta, like F6inius Farsaid, as a focal point for the convergence of native and Christian tradition in LG. 57On this important element in medieval Irish thought see Charles Donahue, 'Beowulf, Ireland, and the natural good', Traditio 7 (1949-51), 263-77. The locus classicus for it is the introduction to the Senchus Mdr (Ancient Laws, I, 16ff; Corpus luris, 342.3-14, 875.35 876.3, 1656.10-24).

MARK SCOWCROFT De Danann under Fomorian taxes.59 This not only distinguishes the Irish from other Indo-European theomachies but contradicts the logic of invasion and conquest. The outcome - not exodus but divine victory -returns us to the Indo-European norm (and thus to the pagan Irish myth), but we shall witness other instances of its transformation in LG. A second biblical prototype for the invasions of Ireland is the story of the Deluge, which supplements the exodic migration-myth with a pattern for the colonization of an empty land. We have seen that wt began with the Noachic ancestry of the Irish populations; ml02 and a7-10 expatiate on his descendants in general, and bl 1-15 on the Flood-narrative itself. This be- comes a prototype for the invasions of Ireland not only because it is the quintessential origin-legend for the nations of the earth but because, Ireland being an island, all invaders must take ship to reach her. The operation of this colonization-myth accounts for the disappearance of the first three races before their successors arrive - the sons of Noah settled an empty earth - but the myth has affected all of the invasion-narratives to a greater or lesser degree. The most striking evidence of the historians' debt to the Noah story is the recurrence of an octad among the invaders of Ireland. Genesis VII:6 describes Noah's household as including his wife, their three sons, and their wives. The Bible lays no great emphasis on the total number, but it appears to have taken hold of the medieval Irish imagination. In an eighth-century commentary on Matthew preserved in Wiirzburg, we read that the number eight signifies the people in the Ark.60 Noah's octad receives special notice in the Sex Aetates Mundi (§§18, 34), Saltair na Rann (2721f.), the copy of Togail Troi preserved in RIA MS Stowe D.iv.2 (#1223, fol. 26ra12), and in LG itself (a7, bl I), which goes on to describe the three lineages founded by the octad, their division of the world into three parts, and (in P) the nations descended from them (m102, a8-10). This story establishes a pattern for tract II. Of Parthol6n, b210 says, 'eight was his number, viz. four men and four women' (ochtar a lTn .i. cethrarfer 7 cethrar ban); a200 omits mention of the wives, but the group is dubbed an octad (ochtar) in fIXXXII:4 and a 'group of eight people' (dcm ochtair) in the dindsenchas of Inber mBuada.61 Ac- cording to b184 and b248, a 'Nemed-ochtar' then colonize Ireland, sur- vivors (in b248) of the flood at the golden tower on the sea.

MARK SCOWCROFT gives Agnoman a third son named Glass,63 but the same three establish dynasties as in the prose, and the number of leaders is quickly reduced to four coming out of 'Muir Libis' (pXIII:24) and another four on the trip to Spain (pXIII:34). The four ships that Srfi takes to Scythia (p109, b126), Mil to Egypt (b409), and the Gaedil to Spain (p116, b127), requiring of course four captains, may also reflect the Noachic octad. In Historia Brittonum (§14), one 'Damhoctor' - a name that Zimmer recognized as the phrase dam ochtair - colonizes Britain.64 Some of these Milesian examples deviate from the basic pattern of parents, three sons, and their wives, preserving instead only three lineages, four couples, or even four leaders. Other possible reinterpretations of the octad include the seven or eight sons of Mil: the Milesian octad can thus be analysed along Noachic lines, comprising Mil, his wife, the three sons who had descendants, and their wives; or as Mil and his seven sons; or as the eight sons alone, Mil having elected to stay in Spain.65 The Tuatha D6 Danann are similarly said in b to have followed Bethach mac Iarbon6oil and seven subsidiary leaders (toisig) referred to as the seven sons of Ethliu (secht meic Ethlend); in Lebor Bretnach, on the other hand, the gods have simply eight 'chief artificers' (primelathnaig).66 The two lists overlap but do not entirely agree, and no apparent reason but the limitation to eight ex- cludes from one list those entered on the other. The lists break down, like the Milesians, into a chieftain and seven subordinates or simply eight chief- tains. Also in Lebor Bretnach (§§4, 13), Cruithne, eponymous ancestor of the Picts (Cruithnig), is credited with seven sons; this claim is incorpor- ated into 1496. According to the Genealogies, the Fomoire descend from the seven sons of Meircell.67 We may assume, then, that the notion of the octad that takes ship to populate an empty land had become separate in the authors' minds from its source in the Noah story and was susceptible, therefore, to various inter- 63Though Glass thus constitutes a Noachic third son for Agnoman, Caicher establishes the Noachic third dynasty, Glass dying childless.

It appears that the original doctrine of co gave Mil seven of them; when an eighth name accrued, b revised this doctrine but p did not; a is inconsistent. In a385, Mil accompanies his 'seven' sons to Ireland; in b385, he stays behind when the eight invade. 66See b353 and bLX, which read 'Iardainis' for the 'Iarboneoil' proper to at. Ethlenn, appa- rently a variant of Ethnenn, genitive of Ethne (the mother of Lug, who is included here among the seven), has acquired independence both as a nominative and as a man's name in the Genealogies (see O'Brien, CGH, 622 s. n.); in m319 and mLXVI:3, Ethliu or Ethlenn is the name of Lug's father. The seven sons - the Dagda, Dian C6cht, Creidne, Luchtaine, Nuadu, Lug, and Goibnenn (original genitive of Goibniu) - are genealogical nonsense according to LG, but appear elsewhere, singly or in groups, with the same matronymic. Lebor Bretnach (§12) omits Nuadu and Bethach, and adds Ogma and Etan (all citations of this text are from the edition of A. G. van Hamel (Dublin 1932)).

Nemed has a total of four sons, but Eochaid ua Floinn names the first three as leaders of the expedition to Ireland (caXLI:9) - thus concurring with the Noachic formu- lation in b248 - and the fourth, along with a grandson and great-grandson, as leaders of the attack on Tor Conaind (aXLI:21, cXLII:2). With this regrouping of the octad the prose of a agrees (a242, b256) - though the death of Nemed himself rather spoils it (a241, b254, cAXLI:17) - but in naming all four sons as leaders of the original invasion (a237, b249) t causes trouble for b248-50.68 An attempt in b249 to resolve this conflict between x and b248 by assigning the four wives to the four sons and excluding Nemed from the direm is flatly contradicted by his wife's death in the next para- graph.

These variations, in- consistencies, and attempts at correction or harmonization all result from the threefold division of the Noachic octad which, when abstracted from its specifically biblical realization, can generate three or four Nemetian sons, ancestors, chieftains, or races: variants of a traditional theme which the canon must somehow resolve into doctrine. Just as the Nemetian octad generates four sons, so does the Partholonian in b212 - the octad becoming thus a decad in c210 - and b221 portrays them dividing Ireland into fourths. A peculiar passage in 6 (F206, Yc223, YcXXXIV), attributed by BB223 to Cin Dromma Snechtai, similarly por- trays four sons of Parthol6n named Er, Orba, Fergna, and Fer6n dividing Ireland among them. This claim both reorganizes the Partholonian octad and gives him a new family - the namesakes, according to this passage, of the Milesian tetrad69 - but the division of Ireland into fourths is as common as that into halves or fifths, while its trisection, despite a strong tendency in Irish, Celtic and indeed universal thought toward triadic formu- lations, is rare, and is seldom described (as are other divisions) in geogra- 681n a237, the sons are named as Starn, larbon61 FAid, Annind, and Fergus Lethderg; b249 reverses the last two. This variation may indicate an original trio in a (as in aXLI:9?) supple- mented by the interlinear addition of Fergus Lethderg (from Togail Tuir Chonaind), probably above Annind; a and b then incorporated Fergus differently into the series inherited from a. The appearance of four leaders here is therefore a textual accident, and we may consider Nemed's colonizing octad an integral part of a. The four sons appear also in pCXV:8b - Fergus following Starn, and Annind rhyming with lind -but separate again into the original trio, whose deaths are described in verse 9, and Fergus, who leads his people subsequently (iarsin) to the attack on Tor Conaind and dies in combat with Morc mac Deled (verse 10). Here again, the full tally of sons is secondary to the Noachic formulation. 69The four are described as sons of tber Finn (i.e. tber mac Miled as distinguished from his brother Donn, here called Iber Donn) in aID385, a403, and m467; in p499f. and pCXV:35 they are also said to have reigned as kings (III). This testimony must be an innovation in p, for rl385 describes them as sons of Brige mac Bregoin, the grandfather of Mil, and b does not acknowledge their kingship.</page><page sequence="26">26 R. MARK SCOWCROFT phical detail.70 One may therefore suspect that its occurrence, even in the absence of an octad or three lines of descent, reflects the Noachic pattern. The sons of Cermait, husbands of the three goddesses after whom Ireland is named (a316(d), b334) and the last of her divine kings (p315, b354), so divide her in p315, and are finally slain by three sons of Mil.7' Muimne, Luigne, and Laigne, three (childless) sons of Erem6n, succeed him as kings (II) in c499; in b they rule in joint sovereignty (comf/aithius) and in a and xLXV:35 divide the country into thirds. In f, trisection even affects the origin-legend of Ireland's provinces or 'fifths' (c6icid), the five brothers who establish them (along with the kingship of Ireland) grouping themselves asymmetrically in three boats, landing at three places on three days, and founding three royal lineages (F279, b286). This odd tradition surely reflects the attempts of its author to realize the invasion of the Fir Bolg simultane- ously in terms of five Fifths and the three divisions of the world. Even the antediluvians follow Noah to some degree, the three Spanish fishermen with their wives (F168, b173, FYXXII), Banba (F167, Y175) and Cessair (c) with their three men and host of women attempting at least to found three lines of descent; Cessair's women, though not Ireland itself, are divided formally into three groups (aXXV, /#XXIV:4, b181), and the men settle finally in places perhaps implying a trisection of the country.72 An octad is never achieved - the Spanish expedition being leaderless, Banba and Cessair acting as leaders but also as chief wives of one of the three men in their companies - but Cessair's relationship with Noah himself and flight from his household offset this omission with a direct analogy. Her voyage is interpreted as the dark counterpart of Noah's - the flight of idolaters 70For divisions of Ireland in half, see note 131; divisions into four or five reflect different interpretations of the four great provinces or 'fifths' (c6icid) of Ireland (on which see part I, note 85 (p. 108)). This Partholonian division into four - described as is usual by end-points along the coast - does not correspond to the traditional c6icid, however. The end-points at Ath Cliath Laigen (Dublin) and Ath Cliath Medraige (a few miles south-east of Galway) correspond to those of the boundary between Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga, while the other end- points at Ailech N6it (ancient capital of Tir Conaill) and Oil6n Arda Nemid (C6bh Island in Cork Harbour) are less easily explained, except perhaps as boundaries between rival branches of the Ui Neill and toganachta respectively. 7~After p315 notices the trisection of Ireland, a remarks that the three kings left no sons: an indication perhaps that dynasties should normally populate such divisions. The sons of Mil slew the sons of Cermait to avenge three sons of Bregon (Ith, Cuailnge, and Fuat); gLVI:35 and b354 name the slayers as tber, trem6n, and Amargen. 72These places, where Ladra and Bith finally die and where Fintan goes into retreat (a170, b177), are Ard Ladrann on the east coast of County Wexford, Sliab Betha at the convergence of counties Tyrone, Fermanagh, and Monaghan, and Fert Fintain at the southern end of Lough Derg, Co. Tipperary (see Hogan, Onomasticon, s. nn). They form a triangle around the Leinster midlands and may possibly reflect an east-west-north division. Compare the division of Ireland by the Nemetians after Togail Tuir Chonaind (aXLII: 11-13, H271), which marks thirds at the Boyne, Belach Conglais (near Cork), and Toirinis Cetne (Derinish off the north- east coast of County Sligo: see Henry Morris, 'Where was Tor Inis, the island fortress of the Fomorians?', J. R. Soc. Antiq. Ir. 57 (1927), 47-58). For a different explanation of this and other elements of the Cessair story, and an interesting discussion of its traditional associations, see John Carey, 'Origin and development of the Cesair legend', tigse 22 (1987), 37-48. If he is right to postulate a native inundation-myth centring on Commar na Tri nUisce (the confluence of the rivers Nore, Barrow, and Suir near Waterford), the similarities between this narrative and the Noah story would have drawn them together, and Cessair into LG.</page><page sequence="27">LEABHAR GABHALA 27 before the Deluge (a169 and especially b179), whose own ark is driven by storm to its destination (b180) - and corresponds therefore to the story of the Deluge in the same way as do the wanderings of the Gaedil to the Exodus. Both the invasion (in b) and diaspora (in a) of the Nemetians, on the other hand, are perfect variants of the abstract prototype: miniature Flood-narratives survived by a Noachic octad who populate with three races the empty land. We may even equate their Fomorian enemies, who perish in the flood at Tor Conaind, with the children of Cain who perished in the Deluge, thus following the explicit claim of the Sex Aetates Mundi (§17) that the Fomoire descended from Cain. A reconsideration of this doctrine in §§33f. derives them instead from Noah's son Cham, who inherited the curse of Cain after the Flood that destroyed his progeny; with this the Genealogies agree.73 The significance of this passage transcends the simple logic with which it refutes the alter- native account - that the Flood destroyed Cain's kin, so latter-day mon- sters must have a subsequent origin - because it uses the typological equiva- lence of Cain and Cham as grounds for transferring the descendants of the one to the other: typology creates history. If, as a7 says, Noah is the second Adam, then Cham is the second Cain. Cham's descendants also include Nimrod and the Egyptians (§28) - the text here following Genesis X:6-8 and Isidore's Etymologiae (IX.ii. 10) respectively - and in this light we may see Conand, builder of the tower whence the Nemetian nations dispersed,74 as a Fomorian Nimrod, and Morc mac Deled, drowned in the flood that precipitated the Nemetian exodus, as a Fomorian Pharaoh. Togail Tuir Cho- naind thus combines elements of three biblical events that receive special emphasis in LG: the Flood and origin of nations, Babel and the origin of languages, and the Exodus and migration to the promised land. Isidore brings the first two together by identifying the 72 languages that emerged from Nimrod's Tower with the 72 nations descended from the children of Noah (IX.i. 1, IX.ii.2).75 Several of these personages help to build the tower in bV:43ff, which juxtaposes its measurements with those of the Ark; this poem was also known by the author of p.76 A long tradition of patristic 73See O'Brien, CGH, 330. On the two teachings about the origins of Irish monsters see Charles Donahue, 'Grendel and the Clanna Cain', J. Celt. St. 1 (1950), 167-75, and James Carney, Studies in Irish Literature and History (Dublin 1955), 102ff. Although Cessair does not confront the Fomoire, she in b175 seeks to find a place free of people - thus of evil and transgression - but also of beasts and monsters, and therefore exempt from the Flood. The author of this passage is probably alluding to the doctrine that monsters descended from Cain, whose progeny God summoned the Flood to extirpate. 74Compare the use of scailid and scailiud to describe the dispersal of nations after Babel (note 55) with descriptions of the Nemetian diaspora in a243 ('Lotar-side ass for scail a Harind'), b256 ('dolotar for scail(ed) a Herenn'), and b265 ('iar scailed HWrenn'). "On the 72 nations and 72 languages see also Augustine, De Civ.

MARK SCOWCROFT typology identifies the Exodus with the Flood as enactments of God's coven- ant with His people, and Nimrod shares more with Pharaoh than common ancestry." The three have strong typological affinities in patristic tradition, therefore, as well as common motifs that facilitate their narrative fusion, but each also contributes unique elements that betray the presence of the several prototypes. The result is a kind of patristic poetics: the narrative expression of ideas widespread in medieval biblical scholarship. Variants of the Tor Conaind story surviving in Historia Brittonum (§13), Lebor Bretnach (§12), and b248 demonstrate its antiquity and importance in the LG tradition; indeed, Orgain Tuir Chonaing appears in the saga-lists.78 Although Lebor Bretnach is the Irish translation of Historia Brittonum, at- tributed in one recension to Gilla Coemain, their versions of the story differ markedly, Lebor Bretnach transforming Nennius' narrative (which re- sembles b248) into something more like Togail Tuir Chonaind, though with unique features as well. This version describes the eight primelathnaig of the Tuatha De Danann waging war on the Fomoire until they retreat to their great stronghold on the sea, where the battle continues until inundated by rising tides; one ship's company survives to populate the island. The story concludes with a reference to the Nemetian variant. Nennius describes the Milesian attack on a glass tower in the middle of the sea, the unidentified inhabitants of which refuse to speak. All but thirty couples prevented by shipwreck from joining the expedition are drowned on the shore by rising tides; the survivors colonize Ireland (in b248 the attackers are Nemetians prompted by greed to attack a golden tower). This kind of variation, like that among the early versions of tract I, indicates an old and widespread 77According to exegetical tradition, the Deluge and the Exodus are typically equivalent to baptism and confession (which represent their tropological significance in the fourfold allegor- ical system as described by John Cassian, Collationes, XIV.viii, ed. Migne, PL, XLIV, 962), and allegorically foreshadow the Harrowing of Hell and the Last Judgement: they thus signify the redemption of the soul from sin and of the Church from the reprobate (see Tertullian, Liber de Baptismo (CCL, I, cap. viii); St Optatus Milevi, De Schizmate Donatistarum adversus Par- menianum, I.v (PL, XI, 894); St Zeno Veronensis, Tractatus, II.liv and lxiii (PL, XI, 510 and 519); St Ambrose, De Sacramentis, I.iv.11, I.vi.20-3, II.i (PL, XVI, 420ff); Apologia Prophetae David, VIII.43 (PL, XIV, 867); Pseudo-Ambrose (fifth-century), De XLII Mansionibus Filiorum Israel, septima mansio (PL, XVII, 18); Augustine, Enarrationes in Psalmos, psalms LXXII:5, LXXX:8, CV:10, CVI:3, and CXXXV:9 (CCL, XXXIX, 989f., 1124; XL, 1559f., 1571f.); De Catechizandis Rudibus, XX.34 (CCL, XLVI, 158f.); Contra Faustum Manichaeum, XII.xvii (PL, XLII, 263); Quodvultdeus Carthaginensis, Sermo VII de Cataclysmo, III.22-4 (CCL, LX, 410-12); Cassiodorus, Expositio in Psalterium, psalms XVIII:10, LXXIII:12, and LXXX:5f.

Into this system of correspondences, Augustine integrates the Tower of Babel both as a completion or recapitulation of the Noachic origin of peoples and as punishment visited upon the reprobate for their impietas superba; the house of Heber, on the other hand, in which Hebrew was preserved, is the civitas Dei, and he therefore the equivalent of Noah or Moses (see note 55 and the Quaestionum in Heptateuchum Libri Septem, I.xx (CCL, XXXIII, 6f.)). Isidore repeats this argument in his Quaestiones in Vetus Testamentum: in Genesin, cap. ix (PL, LXXXIII, 207ff); in Allegoriae quaedam Sacrae Scripturae, §§17f., 57, 59 (PL, LXXXIII, 97ff), he pro- nounces Nimrod and Pharaoh types of the devil, and Heber and Moses types of the Redeemer. 78See part I, p. 107.</page><page sequence="29">LEABHAR GABHALA 29 tradition among the learned which in some cases sheds or transforms motifs here derived from biblical prototypes. A fundamentally scholarly conception, it behaves nevertheless like the conventional story-patterns (sctla) of native tradition, but there is surely another echo of Babel, unique to Nennius' version, in the inability of the attackers to communicate with the besieged. LG thus comprises two biblical stories - the Exodus and the Deluge - to which the wanderings of the Gaedil and the voyage of Cessair (respectively) are juxtaposed and thus implicitly compared, and several variants of each, which share many of the same narrative elements without inviting such comparisons. The latter testify to the naturalization of these prototypes in Irish tradition as myths governing the Origin of Nations and Migration of Peoples: story-patterns abstracted from their original settings and content, and adaptable like so many of the scela to a variety of personages, places and things. The cyclic repetition of these patterns, following the statement of their prototypes in the biblical introduction to LG, resembles a theme with variations in music. A third biblical prototype, the Tower of Babel, receives equal attention in LG, but is abstracted into a story-pattern only in combination with the others, in Togail Tuir Chonaind and its variants. These three narratives pervade LG as did biblical history the minds of its authors, but also illustrate how foreign material could be digested in Irish tradition, following the forms and processes of its mythopoeic literature. If the wanderings of the invaders resemble those of the Israelites, and the repeated colonizations of Ireland the post-diluvian population of the earth, it is small wonder that the scheme of history as a whole in LG should also correspond to the conventional model of world history in the Middle Ages. Comparing the chronology of LG with the principal medieval authority on (ancient) world history, the Chronicon of Eusebius in St Jerome's translation,79 we find that the invasions of Parthol6n, Nemed, the Fir Bolg, and the Milesians coincide with the foundation of the great world-kingdoms of the Third Age: the Assyrian, the Median, the Persian, and the Alexandrian Greek. Mac N6ill first discovered this chronological system in tract IV, which is interpolated (as s) into b, and argued that the invasion of the Tuatha De Danann must have been added to the scheme after it had already become established enough to acquire the Eusebian chronology. The only political disturbance recorded during the Persian world-kingdom - thus between the invasions of the Fir Bolg and Milesians - was the revolt of thefratres magi, who slew Cambyses in the thirty-eighth year of the dynasty, ruled for seven months, and were overthrown by Darius, who restored the Persian monarchy. With this event the invasion of the Tuatha D6 Danann was synchronized, the eight reigns of the Fir Bolg having to be squeezed consequently into 38 years and the seven of the Tuatha De Danann to be stretched out over 196.80 79Ed.

MARK SCOWCROFT Mac NMill's demonstration that the Tuatha De Danann were the last group to join an already established sequence of invaders vindicates such texts as Historia Brittonum and what Bartholomew Mac Carthy calls 'Syn- chronisms A' in BB, which omit them, and furnishes an important clue to the growth of the tradition.81 Mac Neill did not notice, however, that the scheme he discovered in tract IV lay behind tract II as well, though conflict- ing systems and attempts at adjustment often obscure it. All versions of LG agree that the Fir Bolg ruled Ireland for 37 or 38 years, and the Tuatha D6 Danann for 196 or 197, disagreeing only over the interpretation of the ordinal number 38 in Eusebius' Chronicon.82 Between the Nemetian dia- spora and the return of the Fir Bolg, a244 reckons 230 years and b261 200. Estimates of how long the Nemetian colony lasted vary wildly, reflect- ing more often the attempt to reconcile other calculations than genuine or even plausible traditions, but since Fergus Lethderg, Nemed's son, led the attack on Tor Conaind, the 29 (or 59) years that would synchronize the Nemetians with the Medes is a not unreasonable reconstruction.83 A host of incompatible and sometimes baffling calculations surround Parthol6n as well, but wo synchronizes his invasion not with the foundation of the As- syrian world-kingdom but with the sixtieth year of Abraham, 103 years later, which comes close to his journey into Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis XII:4).84 Parthol6n is also used throughout the text the way biblical histor- 11Historia Brittonum describes the invasions of Ireland in §§13f., which I analyse in detail below. Synchronisms A are edited by Mac Carthy in Codex Palatino-Vaticanus no. 830, TLS, III (Dublin 1892), 278ff (see §b). 82Accounts of the Fir Bolg in LG agree generally in giving their kings 37 years of sovereignty; their conquest by the Tuatha De Danann in the 38th year is thus reckoned as confirming a completed 37. In m303, Rindail's three years go back to a scribal error for six (ui &gt; iii); see also a280, b287f. and XLVII (in t, perhaps to), which may be taken to confirm 37 for Wt. I do not know where Macalister found his reading of se instead of coic in wCXV:21c, for the four copies he used agree on the latter reading, which also contributes to a total of 37. The reckoning of 36 years in b184 may result from a misunderstanding of 37 as the 37th year - like the derivation of 37 from the 38th - but this paragraph deviates in other ways from the rest of LG, e.g. giving the Tuatha De Danann only 30 years in the kingship. The original calculation for them in LG appears to have been 196 years (see p310, 312f., 315, and 2LIV). Copies of pCXV:30a disagree over the reign of the last three kings, LL giving them 29 years (for a total of 196; see LL 111:14773), Ym and Lc 27 (for a total of 194), and BB 30 (for a total of 197); in b352 and b354, the same reckoning as in BBCXV appears, no doubt because of the resubtrac- tion of 37 from 234. LL must therefore contain the original reading. 83There is no chronology for Nemed in the prose of m. Gilla Coemaiin agrees in pCXV: 12 with b that 200 years elapsed between the diaspora and the return of the Fir Bolg, but he also agrees in pCXV:5 with b172 and b208 against (XXX:8, XLI:4, a166, a199) that Parthol6n arrived 311 years after the Flood instead of 300, and cannot therefore be accepted as a witness to the doctrine of o: he has simply consulted b or another source in agreement with it (LL199, consulting him in turn, adds 312 years as the preferred alternative). The source for b's doctrine about the post-Nemetian hiatus is apparently s277 - which has also prompted the addition of a quatrain to aXLI (bXLI:34), and thus a comprehensive revision - and may ultimately result from the inclusion of the 30-year hiatus after Parthol6n as part of the 259-year total (see aXXX:23, xXLI:6, pCXV:7, a237, and b247). In that case, a 29-year stay for Nemed is implied by both versions: 230 + 29 in a and 30 + 200 + 29 in sb. For other calculations of his sojourn in Ireland, see pCXV: 11, s229, s272, and b184. 84See m303, a199, and b208. The slight discrepancy between the foundation of the first world- kingdom and the birth of Abraham - 43 years in Eusebius, 23 in s - may account for some</page><page sequence="31">LEABHAR GABHALA 31 ians used Abraham, as a historical marker with which to date subsequent events. In Parthol6n's case, therefore, the near-coincidence of Ninus and Abraham in Eusebian world history has prompted a shift in the synchronism from the king to the patriarch, but Parthol6n's original position is implied by those of the other invaders. Considering the rivalry between Eusebius' scheme of world-kingdoms and the several schemata of biblical ages avail- able to the authors of LG, their conscientious but often confusing efforts to work out a concordance to these synchronisms, and the vast opportunity for error afforded by Roman numerals, one is surprised to find any scheme emerging from the arithmetrical wilderness as clearly as does this one. The problem with this chronology, and another source of synchronistic confusion, is that the wanderings of the Gaedil in tract I predicate an in- vasion of Ireland contemporary with the recovery of the promised land, 40 years after the Exodus, and not with the empire of Alexander; this doc- trine survives in the so-called 'Irish World-Chronicle' and in the tract from Cin Dromma Snechtai.a5 In w, however, as in Historia Brittonum and Syn- chronisms A, the Milesian invasion coincides with the kingship of David and the building of the Temple, thus closing the Third Age as Partholdn had begun it; aXLII:14 synchronizes Togail Tuir Chonaind with the Exodus.86 Only in b126ff are these doctrines adapted to tracts II and IV: the Milesians return to Scythia after the Exodus, stay there for 912 years, and return to Egypt, where Mil weds another Scotta, likewise the daughter of Pharaoh (as in Cin Dromma Snechtai). After Alexander conquers Egypt, the Miles- vagaries in Partholonian chronology. Compare Keating's citation of a source no longer extant (thus Mac N6ill, p. 141) to the effect that Parthol6n invaded Ireland 22 years before the birth of Abraham (Forus Feasa ar Eirinn, I.vi.2 (ed. David Comyn, ITS, IV (1902), 156)): thus, according to s, when Ninus established the Assyrian world-kingdom. The claim in X that Parthol6n arrived 300 years after the Flood (see note 83) approximates biblical eras more closely than the 60th year of Abraham, the Hebrew reckoning of the Second Age being 292 years according to s227 and its source, Bede's continuation of the Hieronymo-Eusebian chron- icle (see part I, note 127 (p. 125)). Hence Parthol6n's invasion in Abraham's seventh (b221) or ninth (b6184) year, the subtraction of 292 from 300 yielding two estimates adjusted to reflect the difference between cardinal and ordinal reckoning. The synchronism of Parthol6n with Abraham's 60th year appears also in s227. Side by side with the same calculation in m303 is another positing 2608 years between Adam and Parthol6n: exactly the interval between Adam and Abraham according to the Hebrew reckoning in Synchronisms A (ed. Mac Carthy, op. cit., 278, §a). The Partholonian occupation is reckoned variously, lasting 300 years in aXXX:21 and b184 but no longer than Parthol6n's lifetime in a205; b220 says that he died 30 years after his arrival, his people 500 years later. This last doctrine originated probably in s227, and has spread to cXXX:21. "For the testimony of the 'World-Chronicle' (on which see O'Rahilly, EIHM, 253f.) see The Annals of Inisfallen (ed. Mac Airt), §35, and the Cottonian Annals (ed. A. Martin Freeman, 'The Annals in Cotton MS Titus A.XXV', RC 41 (1924), 301-30), §36. 8"See p469, b6184, and acLXV:13. In 6 and Synchronisms A, 440 years are said to have elapsed between the Exodus and the Milesian invasion (F108, Y125, cl50; Mac Carthy, op. cit., 280, §b); Eusebius calculates 479 from Exodus to the building of Solomon's Temple. Nennius simply says that the Britons came to Britain during the Third Age and the Irish to Ireland during the Fourth (§16), which began according to his scheme with the kingship of David (§6), 500 years after Moses (§1). This doctrine appears to conflict with §15, however, which places the Milesian invasion 1002 years after the Exodus: approximately at the end of the Fourth Age, when the Temple was rebuilt.</page><page sequence="32">32 R. MARK SCOWCROFT ians flee (by way of Scythia) to Spain, and shortly thereafter invade Ireland. According to 6, adapting perhaps the testimony of Cin Dromma Snechtai itself, Scotta subsequently becomes Erem6n's wife (F387, D419); according to f, she dies at the battle of Sliab Mis (F387, D419, r1420),87 This conflict among the various chronologies for the Milesian invasion, implicit already in wc (if p is any indication) but obvious from the moment a came into being, presented a great challenge to its scholarly heirs, and the solution represented by the double narrative in b - which must have existed already in # - presents a similar challenge to the editor of co. The Eusebian background to the chronology of the invasions, as Mac Neill points out, establishes the Tuatha D6 Danann as the last addition to the (post-diluvian) scheme. Nennius, however, appears to reflect a still ear- lier stage in its development, before the Fir Bolg were recognized as invaders of Ireland at all: 'Builc cum suis tenuit Euboniam insulam [the Isle of Man] et alias circiter' (§14), but the 'tres filii militis Hispaniae' follow 'Nimeth' directly (§13). Similarly in Synchronisms A, only Parthol6n, Nemed, and the Milesians are recorded as invaders, and the statement in LL199 that three invaders took Ireland landing at Inber Scene may reflect the same stage in the growth of the tradition. Before attempting to solve the riddles of Parthol6n and Nemed, however, we must assess the significance of these additions, which gave ct and especially a an 'invasion-myth' fusing elements of pagan theology with the politics of medieval Ireland. TRACT II: MYTH INTO HISTORY In terms of narrative design, a treats two subjects: the origins and history of the Gaedil (1-19, 103-33) and the inhabitants and rulers of Ireland (166ff). Beginning with Creation, the text pursues the first topic until the eve of the Milesian migration from Spain, breaks off to treat the second, and brings the Milesians to Ireland as part of a sequence of invaders. Begin- ning with the Fir Bolg, and endorsed for co by p, a king-list emerges which, after an excursus on the Milesian kingdoms (tuatha) of Ireland (the end of tract I), blends into the regnal history that is tract III. The development of this into a chronicle of the Tara kingship yielded p, while ac incorporated a large body of narrative (especially tract II) and thus produced a history of pre-Patrician Ireland. Despite the relative youth of tract II, it preserves some very old traditions, historical, legendary, and mythological, and has always presented the great- est challenge (or temptation) to students of Irish prehistory or Celtic paga- nism. The tract has a cyclic structure, portraying a series of invaders who act out, mutatis mutandis, a single drama of colonization and conquest. All but the Tuatha D&amp; Danann and Milesians find Ireland uninhabited, and thus 70On the debt of 6 to Cin Dromma Snechtai see part I, p. 98.

All but the antediluvians and the Fir Bolg, however, must subsequently vanquish the Fomoire, whose pres- ence, if accounted for at all, also results from an invasion. We have seen that their oppression of the Nemetians follows an Exodic pattern combined finally with echoes of Babel and the Flood, but even here Tor Conaind is taken and his army defeated before Morc attacks and the tides sweep in.88 The Partholonians, Nemetians, and Milesians build forts, clear plains, and witness the bursting forth of rivers and lakes 89 - thus does the land take shape - and all invaders give their names to places. Up to and including Nemed, the invaders finally disappear, the Fir Bolg and Tuatha D6 Danann (returned Nemetians) are conquered by their successors, and the Milesians establish permanent control. The text thus brings four primary races into the world of medieval Irish historiography: the Milesians and Fir Bolg, from whom descend the sovereign tuatha (saerchlanna) and aithechthuatha respectively; the gods of Irish paganism; and their enemies, the monstrous Fomoire. Figure 3 displays their encounters and the sequence of conflict and conquest. Variations notwithstanding, one can discern a recurrent pattern in this tract which I call the 'invasion-myth'. I use the term 'myth' here to denote a narrative archetype sufficiently autonomous and pervasive in tradition to affect its growth. This is a functional, literary definition which we have already seen satisfied by story-patterns abstracted from the Bible. The mythi- cal mode of thinking interprets the 'accidents' of experience or tradition by recognizing in them elements of a normative pattern, and recasting them to fit it: argument and evidence are indistinguishable in the retelling that constit- utes interpretation. The logic is metaphorical rather than abstract, an- alogical and deductive rather than empirical and analytic, and an innate faculty rather than a learned discipline, though mythopoeia itself is a rare enough art. The mode flourishes of course where such accidents are freely invented (as in certain literary genres), ill-attested (as in an oral culture), or subject to falsification (as in propaganda), but persisted among the early Irish literati as a habit of thought which was harnessed to historical scholar- ship only as the documentary sources resulting from their mythopoeia came together in a canon. Such scholarship, of course, relied more on the study of written authorities than on the testing of them against fact or probability, but in that respect conformed to the medieval European norm. "SSee a242, cxXLI:24, and aXLII:4f There is a lacuna here in b256, but Eochaid ua Floinn's poems and the near identity of the surrounding prose-texts in a and b endorse this doctrine for Lx. 89 For Parthol6n see a203f., b214, b219, and aXXX:lIff; for Nemed, a238-41, b250-3, and caXLI:10-15; and for the Milesians, a471-3, b431, b477-9, and acLXV:24-31 (see also in tract III cr501, w502, cr505 (pXCVI:10-12), a508 (pXCIX), w509 (pC:3), w511 (p(CI:6-8), aLXV:37f., 41, 53, 58f., and 61f.; b557bis and a558; b573bis and a573; b594bis, a593, and a595).

Subsumed under this definition of myth is its canonical expression - the genre of sacred stories collected in a particular mythology - but archetype and sacred story are not necessarily the same thing. The story of Lug and Balor in Cath Maige Tuired (CMT), for example - a text that comes as close as any in Irish literature to the genre of (pagan) mythology - does not actually comprise what scholars refer to as the 'Lug-Balor myth', that Irish realization of the international story-pattern called by W. J. Gruffydd 'the King and his Prophesied Death'.90 This is attested in later texts, folklore and the Welsh mabinogi of Math, and has spread as a narrative archetype to other personages in Irish tradition (notably Finn mac Cumaill): 91 it is thus a myth but not a sacred story. Scholars have tended to ignore this distinction, dubbing the structural archetype a historical prototype and the author of CMT a bungler. If we accept the evidence we have, however, and apply to it more strictly the rules of reconstruction, we find that the reverse is more likely. With the slaying of Balor the battle of Mag Tuired turns against the Fomoire, whose intermarriage with the Tuatha De Danann has produced the warring kings, Bres and Lug. The scions of complementary unions, both lead their fathers' kin against their mothers', thus vindicating 9oSee his Math vab Mathonwy (Cardiff 1928), 46-207; also Mac Cana, 'Conservation and innovation', 77, and Rees and Rees, Celtic Heritage, 223f.

It is appropriate in this context that Lug should slay his maternal grandfather, but their family problems are otherwise irrelevant. The event is first prophesied in Oidhe Chlainne Tuireann, and Balor takes steps to prevent it in the folktales.92 We witness here the absorption of accident into pattern, the relationship between Lug and Balor, and their final encounter attracting the King and his Prophesied Death, which recast it then in a conventional narrative mould. Applying the literary counterpart of the lectio difficilior rule, we see the story growing more conventional as time goes on rather than (unaccountably) more faithful to its 'original' form. Such revisions even of the mythological canon must cast doubt on the fidelity of its earliest witnesses to a religion long abandoned at the time of their composition. Reading CMT, one must indeed suspect not so much the histor- icization of the event (a mythological commonplace) or the anthropomorphism of its participants (the Indo-European norm) but the portrayal of the theom- achy as a war between medieval tuatha.93 Only extreme assumptions about the 'archaism' of Irish tradition could justify the belief that a text so clearly addressed to a medieval audience should also represent Irish paganism. The pre-Christian content of the Mythological Cycle can only be established, strictly speaking, by comparison with the testimony of archaeology, classical ethnography, or other Indo-European mythologies. The mythographers of Christian Ireland were too interested in the old gods to leave them alone. To CMT itself and to Irish mythology in general, LG has made such extensive contributions that the pagan cosmogony and theology are all but impossible to recover with any certainty. It has long been understood that the two battles of Mag Tuired derive from a single mythical event - the Indo-European theomachy - and that the First Battle is an invention of LG based on what we now call the Second Battle.94 Apparently the First Battle constituted LG's euhemerized version of the myth; subsequently, the original story, proving both tenacious in tradition and sufficiently different from LG's version to be interpreted as a separate event, was added to the canon. We can even identify the period during which this addition took place, for Eochaid ua Floinn (in aLIII) and the poet Tanaide (in aLIV) manifest no awareness of two such battles - recognizing the First Battle only95 - nor can one include the Second Battle in the prose of ,, 1p312 and 92See Ua Ceallaigh, Tri Truagha, 8f., and Gruffydd, loc. cit. The narrative archetype is attached to Finn as early as Fotha Catha Cnucha (ed. W. M. Hennessy, RC 2 (1873-5), 86-93), and the lateness of its attestation in the literary cycle of Lug could be accidental, but what appears to be a gradual progression towards the archetype in these texts is surely significant. Also noteworthy in the folktales about Lug is the absence of the theomachy as a context for the slaying of Balor. 93This argument is effectively proved, and the attendant problem ignored, by Elizabeth A. Gray in 'Cath Maige Tuired: myth and structure', Eigse 18 (1980-1), 183-209; 19 (1982-3), 1- 35, 230-62.

MARK SCOWCROFT b352 being independent additions to the common text; Flann Mainistrech, however, who died half a century after Eochaid, makes (in pLVI) a clear distinction between the 'First Battle' (cttchath Maige Tuired) in 3d and the 'Great Battle' (cath m6r Maige Tuired) in 32d.96 At roughly the same time, his associate, Eochaid ua Cerin, introduced the First Battle to Irish learning outside of LG.97 The paragraphs of CMT describing the invasion of the Tuatha De Danann and their encounter with the Fir Bolg are copied or paraphrased directly from LG, and the text entitled Cath Maige Tuired Cunga was written subsequently, apparently to give the First Battle some dignity in literary circles.98 Though it never really caught on there, the poets unaffiliated with LG continuing to insist on a single (viz. the Second) Battle of Mag Tuired, the double version based on LG has commanded enough authority to receive serious attention from Sir John Rhys, Georges Dumezil, and Alwyn and Brinley Rees. "9 While the Rees brothers' analysis of Irish and Welsh literature as testimony to cultural ideology in the broad- est sense saves them here from the anachronism of Rhys's proto-Celtic and Dumezil's Indo-European interpretations, they all err in accepting the two battles as an integral tradition rather than an accident in the compila- tion of LG. Once established there, the two battles are further distinguished by the relocation of the First at Mag Tuired Cunga (Cong, Co. Mayo), but the extant recensions preserve testimony to its original location in Kilmactranny parish, Co. Sligo.100 Thus, according to a and pXLVIII:9, the Tuatha De sithi with fichi (6a) rules out 'fairy-folk', and we are probably to understand the line as 'he brought an onrush to battle': hardly evidence for Tanaide's endorsement of the two battles. "6Compare, however, pXLVIII:9-l1, which records events associated with both battles, but only names the Second as 'cath Maige Tuired tiar'. In pCXV:23f. and 26, Gilla Coemain records deaths otherwise assigned to both battles, but names neither of them; his reference to Cath Maige Tuired in 'Annalad anall uile' (LL III: 15473) is ambiguous, but its synchronization with the sack of Troy recalls CMT, §69. "9See Rudolf Thurneysen, 'Das Gedicht der vierzig Fragen von Eochaid ua Cerin', ZCP 13 (1921), 130-6, §11; the association of the two poets is mentioned in Lebor na hUidre, p. 39a15, and discussed by Thurneysen on p. 130 of his article. I am grateful to Liam Breatnach for calling my attention to this reference, which was overlooked by Murphy. He cites two saga- lists incorporated into legal tracts (ed. Mac Cana, Learned Tales, 64f.), which include the two battles - the principal lists name only one - and the dindgenchas of Lusmag and Umall (ed. Gwynn, Metrical Dindsienchas, IV, 182 and 272), which refer (respectively) to 'Mag Tuired tuaid' - this northern Mag Tuired implying perhaps another - and to 'ctchath Muighe Tuiredh atorru [viz. the Tuatha D&amp; Danann] 7 Fir Bolc'. 98See Murphy, 'Notes on Cath Maige Tuired', 195f.; he assigns Cath Maige Tuired Cunga (ed. J. Fraser, Eriu 8 (1917), 1 63) to the late Middle-Irish period. The text of CMT, §§1-7, deri: s from a copy of 6 (see F304f. and D320, 323, 325, 324); §8, on the betrothal of Ethne daughter of Balor to Cian son of Dian Cecht, is unique; §9-13, on the arrival of the Tuatha D6 Danann, the First Battle, and the flight of the Fir Bolg, agree substantively but not verbally with 6 as well (see F306-10 and D327, 327a, 326, 328f.). "9Murphy cites a large number of texts from the ninth to the sixteenth centuries that refer to one battle of Mag Tuired only; if they give further details, these belong to what LG calls the Second Battle. Compared with these references, testimony to the two battles or specifically to the First is scanty (see note 97). Attempts to interpret them as an integral Celtic or Indo- European myth are made by Rhys, Hibbert Lectures (London 1888), 610ff; Dumbzil, Mitra- Varuna (Paris 1948), 180ff; and Rees and Rees, Celtic Heritage, 28ff, 108ff, 361 (note 4). 100For the location of places named in this paragraph I rely on Hogan's Onomasticon (s. nn).</page><page sequence="37">LEABHAR GABHALA 37 Danann came to land on a mountain in Conmaicne Rein (south-east County Leitrim and north County Longford), right across the Shannon from the northern Mag Tuired (a306, b321); in r1322, Sliab in Iarainn, near the source of the Shannon, lies on their route thence to the battle. Immirgi Mac nUmbir, the narrative incorporated by fl into the Fir Bolg section, tells how they fled from the battle north and west to Trtacht (or Traig) Eothaili (Beltra Strand, just south-west of Sligo), where Eochaid mac Eirc was slain (F281, b289). It may be significant that neither of these additions prefixes cot to 'Cath Maige Tuired', their original authors not yet recognizing the distinction introduced by the compilers.'1' The new location for the First Battle appears in b289, which places it in Conmaicne Cuiile Tolat (Kilmaine, Co. Galway), in which Cong lies; a gloss in f attempts to reconcile this tradition with the landing- place of the Tuatha De Danann by equating them (F306, c358).1'02 These claims not only contradict the text inherited from a (f's gloss notwithstand- ing), but would force the Fir Bolg to flee some fifty miles through the ranks of their enemies in order to suffer final defeat at Traicht Eothaili. Responding perhaps to this inconsistent geography, CMT places the landing of the Tuatha D6 Danann in Conmaicne Mara (Ballynahinch, Co. Galway), to the west of Cong and incidentally on the sea (§9), and omits Trtcht Eothaili altogether. As variants of the same myth, the two battles differ most significantly over the identity of the vanquished, which simple euhemerism cannot explain. As a matter of fact, the belligerents in both variants are euhemerized - treated as historical even if also supernatural - and the transformation of giants into men makes little sense when the identity of the gods remains clear. The likeliest explanation for this anomaly - and for its complement, Cath Sl6ibe Mis, in which men defeat the gods - is Mac Neill's theory that the Tuatha De Danann were added to an already established sequence of invaders. Interposed between the Fir Bolg and their erstwhile Milesian con- querors, the Tuatha D&amp; Danann came to play the role of each in opposi- tion to the other. At the same time the theomachy merged with the struggle for Irish sovereignty, spreading divine characteristics to the Milesians and Fomorian to the Fir Bolg.'03 The gods themselves play both roles, becoming 'demons' (demnai) at Cath Sl6ibe Mis, and Fomoire challenge every post- '0oThe prefix is also omitted from CMT, §10, from D327a (which corresponds to r1322), and from F310f. (which represents therefore the reading of p against m and LL); on the other hand, cet- appears in both copies of a307. 102The gloss on a's landing-place for the Tuatha D6 Danann reads (in F) '.i. co Sliabh mac nDelgada i Conmaicni REin .i. Cffili'. Hogan gives us little help with Sliab mac nDelgada, but it does recall the landing-place of the Tuatha De Danann in CMT, §9 (Corcu Belgatan), and may be the product of scribal misreading (see also Hogan, Onomasticon, s. n. Sliab Belgadain Toga). If we assume that the location of the battle in b289 was also in fl, the gloss could have been added originally to 6 and incorporated into the text off. Cong itself is only mentioned in IcL. 103Macalister points out that the conflict between the 'gods of light' and the 'gods of dark- ness' has been 'euhemeristically equated to' that between the Gaedil and their predecessors, but in claiming that the Fir Bolg were 'essentially Fomorians themselves, at least from the standpoint of Mythology', he fails to distinguish the typological equivalence he has just pos- tulated from historical, as it were, genetic equivalence (LGE, IV, 2-4). This tendency to draw</page><page sequence="38">38 R. MARK SCOWCROFT diluvian invader except the Fir Bolg, their human counterparts in the in- vasion-myth. One need not conclude then with d'Arbois de Jubainville that the Fir Bolg worshipped the Fomoire, or with Rhys and Macalister that they were identical.104 We must distinguish the native attributes of such personages from their nonce function in narrative, which here transforms them entirely. The advent of the Tuatha De Danann to LG thus turned a single conflict into two, contributing theomachic elements to both. Subsequently, the con- quest of the Fomoire was itself drafted in, localized like the First Battle on a frontier between professed Milesians and Fir Domnann, and in CMT elaborately interpreted in terms of intertribal (and general) politics.10s I would guess then that the historians attached 'Cath Maige Tuired' to the Tuatha De Danann as part of their incorporation into the LG tradition - probably sometime in the ninth century'06 - but that subsequent disagree- ment over whom they really vanquished generated this particular euhemer- ization of the theomachy as an alternative to the artificial but canonical First Battle.'07 Though the Second Battle remains thus the more faithful expression of the pagan Irish original, the treatment of it even in CMT rests on the same analogical foundations as the First Battle. These exemplify the common mythopoeic tendency to associate binary oppositions in correlative groups, which combine to produce new oppo- sitions, like the First Battle or Cath Tendmaige, by 'correlation on a trans- versal axis' (or breviter, 'transverse correlation').108 Thus, if the Tuatha D&amp; historical conclusions - to 'reconstruct' - from structural and thematic evidence reaches its climax in the work of T. F. O'Rahilly, on which see 0 Cathasaigh, Heroic Biography, 15ff. t04Cycle mythologique, 128ff; Hibbert Lectures, 589ff; LG i, IV, 2-4 (see note 103 above). 0 sCf. O'Rahilly, EIHM, 141-6, who argues that the battles of Mag Tuired recall a Laginian invasion of Connacht in the second century B.C. I make no such claims here, but do think it significant that the battlefield on which the Tuatha D&amp; Danann defeated the Fomoire - and in a the Fir Bolg - should lie on the eastern frontier of lands inhabited by Fir D6mnann, in historical times between Connacht proper and Breifne; surely this is the reason for the choice of Mag Tuired, which was transferred to the Tuatha De Danann upon their induction into LG, and thus became the site for the euhemerized theomachy. Compare the location of Tor Conaind on the border between Connacht and the northern Ui N6ill (see note 72). "06Murphy's oldest reference to Cath Maige Tuired, which is ambiguous, appears in a poem by Flannacan mac Cellaig (oh. 896), ed. Kathleen Mulchrone, 'FlannacAn mac Cellaig Ri Breg hoc Carmen', J. Celt. St. 1 (1950), 80-93, verse 2; the oldest reference assignable to the Second Battle is in Cormac's Glossary, s.v. nesscdit (ed. Meyer, §975; Stokes, p.32), which recounts the forging of weapons by Goibniu, Luchtaine, and Creidne, an episode found also in CMT, §122. Cormac's attribution of this matter to 'senchus na nGaedel' may be a reference to LG itself. It is generally thought that CMT was finally compiled in the eleventh or twelfth century out of materials going back as far as the ninth (see Gray's edition, p.11); the geography and even the name of the battle could thus accrue to the textual tradition at any time during that period. 107See O'Rahilly, EIHM, 388-90, but note that his neglect of the theomachy as an important element in the tradition led him to claim that the significant but minor episode in which Lug slays Balor (§§133-5) was the mythological 'nucleus' around which this 'highly artificial, and loosely constructed, tale has been built up' (p.313). '08See Claude Levi-Strauss, 'The structural study of myth', in Myth: A Symposium, ed. Thomas A. Sebeok (Bloomington 1958), 81-106, §7.1.2. Levi-Strauss's writings on mythological theory and analysis are voluminous, but this article sets forth concisely those properties of</page><page sequence="39">LEABHAR GABHALA 39 Danann are to the Fomoire as the Milesians are to the Fir Bolg, so are the Tuatha De Danann to the Fir Bolg or the Milesians to the Fomoire: Tuatha D6 Danann : Fomoire :: Milesians : Fir Bolg :: Tuatha De Danann : Fir Bolg (Cetchath Maige Tuired) :: Milesians : Fomoire (Cath Tendmaige). It is important to distinguish the historical cause of this system - an ac- cident in the growth of LG - from its mythopoeic effect, which is the typology of the invasion-myth. This then provides Fomorian opposition to Parthol6n and Nemed as well; Cessair escapes, of course, because the Fom- oire descend from Cham. In apparent defiance of this typology, the Tuatha De Danann move from one role to the other, acquiring what mythologists call 'contrary attributes'. These may confuse efforts, medieval and modern, to consolidate the tradi- tion but hardly violate the typological system. Tomas 0 Cathasaigh has shown how a similar process enlivens the typology of heroism and kingship (or villainy) in the cycle of Cormac mac Airt. Repeatedly a hero overthrows the king, takes his place, and is overthrown by a new hero, in the story of whose life he plays the part of the villain. 09 The pattern may be illustrated thus: Villain : Hero : (1) Art mac Cuinn : Lugaid mac Con : (2) Lugaid mac Con : Cormac mac Airt : (3) Cormac mac Airt : Oengus Gaibuaibthech. This 'pecking-order syndrome' throws into high relief the difference between functional and historical identity, for the character of each personage is determined by his relationship with another in a particular narrative context."11 O'Rahilly's 'divine hero' and 'Otherworld god' are not mytho- logical prototypes, the literary examples of which are all 'ultimately identical', but functional archetypes adaptable to any personage, divine, historical, or fictional. The Tuatha D6 Danann similarly conquer their demonic enemies and suffer conquest in turn, becoming demnai in a and allies of the Fomoire in 6 (F387, D419). More radical (and more confusing) than the simple matu- ration of hero into king and new order into old, this almost Manichaean binary opposition most relevant to this discussion. The theories of Lkvi-Strauss have met some resistance in this field, ostensibly because of their resolute ahistoricism but really, I think, because he is a better practical critic than a theoretician, and tends to confuse or offend his literary audiences. Readers interested in the application of his theories to literary scholarship should consult Northrop Frye, The Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays (Princeton 1957). 109Heroic Biography, 13ff.

In CMT (§§41, 43, 87f., 94, 97, 105, 119, 129, 160), the Tuatha D6 Danann are called 'men of Ireland' (fir Erenn) and the Fomoire 'champions of the Other- world' (trinpir in tSida); the latter include Bres's god-like father (§16ff) and the monstrous Balor (§133-5). According to Mesca Ulad and De Gabbil in tSida, however, the Tuatha D6 Danann moved into the sid after the Miles- ians conquered Ireland.'12 To the basic correlation between Irish racial politics and the theomachy, therefore, we may add a cosmological cor- relative, the opposition between fir Jrenn and the people of the Otherworld (aes side). This accounts for the Fomorian associations with the sid, the subsequent move of the Tuatha D6 Danann thither, the alliance and partial merger of the two races, and the evidence used for their equation by T.

O'Rahilly and the Rees brothers.113 (Correlative oppositions) Tuatha D&amp; Danann : Fomoire :: Milesians : Fir Bolg : :fir Erenn : aes side (Transverse correlations) :: Tuatha De Danann : Fir BoIg (C&amp;tchath Maige Tuired) :: Milesians: Tuatha D&amp; Danann (Cath Sleibe Mis) :: Milesians : Fomoire (Cath Tendmaige). These oppositions predicate a series of battles the outcome of which estab- lishes the sovereignty of one group over another. Although one does not think of the aes side as conquered or ruled by the men of Ireland, 0 Catha- saigh has argued that the Otherworld has the power in tradition to grant or withhold the sovereignty of a king. In Togail Bruidne Da Derga, Conaire M6r enjoys their patronage until he betrays his obligation to dispense justice (firflaithemon) and observe certain taboos (gessi); the peace and prosperity that have adorned his reign turn immediately into chaos and desolation.'14 When the Tuatha De Danann retreat to the sid, they retaliate against the Milesians by stirring up conflict (Mesca Ulad) or withholding the fertility of crops and livestock (De Gabaiil in tSida); once dethroned in CMT, Bres similarly leads the Fomoire in battle against his erstwhile subjects, and finally ransoms his life with agricultural knowledge (§§149-61).

The unbearable taxes imposed by the Fomoire in that text, in Oidhe Chlainne Tuireann, and in Togail Tuir Chonaind, no less than their revolt against so many colonists in LG, dramatize the principle that the aes side must assent to the sovereignty of an Irish king, but should not acquire it themselves. We shall see that this has important political implications for their functional equivalents, the Fir Bolg. The cosmological cor- relative does more than accommodate the vagaries of the supernatural, therefore, enriching the significance of the invasion-myth as a charter for the cult of kingship. As such, it incorporates the Fir Bolg as once sovereign peoples later (indeed repeatedly) subjected to the rule of others, but also distinctive in facing no challenge from the Fomoire, defeating no other race in any con- text, and witnessing the creation of no forts, plains, rivers or lakes. The Fir Bolg invade perforce but are not allowed to conquer because behind the defeat of the Fomoire, accomplished after every other postdiluvian invasion, lies the correlative triumph of the Milesians over the Fir Bolg: an act of sovereignty that the latter cannot perform. It is perhaps for this reason that the gods were said to have invaded Ireland between rather than before the two mortal races whose descendants still dwelt there: the Fir Bolg could not conquer anyone. The building of forts and clearing of plains seem likewise the achievements of sovereign peoples, combined with cosmogonic motifs (the appearance of rivers and lakes) into a formula expressing the basic correlation between earthly and supernatural sovereignty. If so, however, the formula was invented independently of the Tuatha D6 Danann, to whom it does not apply in LG, and is better understood simply as an attribute of the Partholonians, Nemetians and Milesians, the three oldest invaders in the LG tradition, whose affinities I discuss below. In any case, when fl calls attention to the uniqueness of the Fir Bolg in this respect (F282, b290f.), ignoring the Tuatha D6 Danann, it implicitly endorses the association of the formula with the saerchlanna. Macalister apparently assumed, when perceiving a 'euhemeristic equation' between the theomachy and the Goedelic conquest of the Irish 'aborigines', that LG preserved some memory of the latter event.'15 Since o cheats us of a single encounter between the Milesians and the Fir Bolg,116 this hypo- thesis rests on no firmer evidence than the similarity between the medieval invasion-myth and the prehistoric fact, which is coincidental. In a long poem later annexed (with a short prose summary) to b594bis, Mael Muru Othna records the earliest extant version of the revolt and reconquest of the aithechthuatha, variants of which appear also in a and (with a different cast I'1See note 103.

MARK SCOWCROFT of characters) in the saga of Bruiden Maic Da Rpo.1M7 Reasoning in much the same way as Macalister, O'Rahilly identifies this tradition with the Goe- delic conquest of Ireland, but what it really resembles is CMT.18 In both, the aithechthuatha overthrow the king of Ireland and disenfranchise his race: by cutting off Nuadu's arm, Sreng of the Fir Bolg renders him unfit to rule, and Bres assumes the kingship (the Fomoire being typologically equiva- lent to the Fir Bolg, according to the invasion-myth); the aithechthuatha slay their Milesian overlords, whose wives flee pregnant to Britain. The subsequent rule of the Fomoire and the aithechthuatha proves disastrous, and the land lies desolate. Traditions concerning the restoration of the saerchlanna here diverge, but both find analogues in CMT. Tuathal Techt- mar - in a the son of Ethne, daughter of the king of Alba - returns to Ireland as a young man, claims his patrimony at Tara, and reconquers the country. So Lug, the son of Ethne, daughter of Balor, returns to his father's people as a young man, gains admittance to Tara, and leads them to victory at Mag Tuired. These two hero-kings thus exemplify the universal narrative pattern called the Expulsion-and-Return Formula,119 but their close similarity in this particular narrative context no doubt inspired the naming of Tuathal's mother. In Bruiden Maic Da Reo, on the other hand, the usurpers, dismayed by the infertility of the land, invite back their over- lords who, like the Tuatha D&amp; Danann in CMT, are referred to asfir Erenn (§5); the healed Nuadu is similarly restored to the kingship after the failure of Bres. The sustained parallelism between CMT and these two stories bespeaks a common prototype which it would be rash to pronounce either a sacred story or a historical memory. As a narrative archetype - the myth as story- pattern - it confers legitimacy on the sovereign nations by exploring the disastrous consequences of revolution, and enlists the messianic hero as an agent of restoration, thus neatly reconciling his aetiological role with the eternal claims of the status quo. Adapted to the theomachy on the one hand and the political antithesis between saerchlanna and aithechthuatha on the other, this archetype generates variants easily fused by the authors of LG, who could also combine it with their biblical migration-myth and thus reinvent Irish prehistory. In a similar way, the genealogical theory of sovereignty approximates the ethnic difference between the Gaedil and their predecessors. We have seen that the central purpose of LG - to attach Irish history to the biblical history of the world - predicates descent from Noah and migration to 17Mael Muru's poem 'Flann for trinn i tig thogaid Tuathal Techtmar', is unpublished, but is summarised in b594bis, c593a-d, and by T.

In accomplishing this genealogical and narrative task, the literati followed the biblical and medieval convention of equating tribes with fam- ilies, deriving a population-group, of whatever size, from a single patriarch, whose direct descendants ruled as kings, and describing the origin of tuatha, like the Noachic origin of nations, in terms of a vast pedigree. Their work coincided with (perhaps furthered) the emergence of tuatha identified by ancestor-figure and ruling dynasty. Thus to take a striking example, the Fir (or Tuatha) 1i nEcmacht gave way to the Connachta, the avowed descend- ants of Conn Cetchathach (XCIX), whose family ruled the coiced.'20 Ex- cluded from this process were the aithechthuatha, who lacked political inde- pendence (and dynastic names) because they were kingless, the status of a tuath corresponding to that of its ruler.121 If that changed, however, so could their place in Irish genealogy: the Dal Cais, whose rise to power in the tenth century earned them a Milesian pedigree, are a famous example.122 Politics, not race, defined the category which, if it included non-Goedelic peoples - and some such tribal names do appear to be non-Irish - did so because of their status. We must understand the prehistoric genealogies as documents legitimizing the status quo according to the law of inherited property and rights, more faithful, therefore, to the period of their composi- tion than to what they ostensibly represent. The racial distinction between saerchlanna and aithechthuatha is thus a genealogical accident which, becom- ing doctrine, contributed yet another correlation to the analogical system of LG: Milesians : Fir Bolg (racial correlative) : : saerchlanna : aithechthuatha (political correlative) : Tuatha D6 Danann : Fomoire (theological correlative) : :fir Erenn : aes side (cosmological correlative). The expression of these political, theological, and cosmological opposi- tions in racial terms exemplifies a common mythopoeic principle: that op- positions without mediation - i.e. without an intermediate or mixed register - tend to be replaced by analogous oppositions that do allow mediation.123 Here a series of unmediated oppositions acquires a correlative that can be mediated through intermarriage. Finn mac Cumaill, according to some auth- orities the son of a royal mother and a father from the aithechthuatha, thus mediates between them.124 Having mixed blood - the metaphor illustrates 12oSee O'Rahilly, EIHM, 1 If. 121See part I, note 120 (p. 122). 122See Donnchadh 0 Corrain, 'Irish origin-legends and genealogy: recurrent aetiologies', in History and Heroic Tale: A Symposium, ed.

Gwynn, Metrical Dindfenchas, II, 72ff, and Fotha Catha Cnucha). His paternal ancestry is also royal in the earliest sources (see O'Brien, CGH, 22, 99), but by the twelfth century is associated with the Ui Thairrsig, a group said by fi to descend from the Fir Bolg (F282, b292): see Macgnimartha Find, ed.

Lug, the child of an opposite union similarly contracted to cement the alliance, overturns the Fomorian hegemony and puts his mother's people in their place. Such important figures as Nuadu, the Dagda, and Balor are here subordinated to the two mediators, the outcome of whose conflict establishes the supernatural order. The fosterage of Lug by Tailltiu, the widow of Eochaid mac Eirc in p311, mediates likewise the opposition between the Tuatha De Danann and the Fir Bolg - arrived at by transverse correlation in the First Battle - though Lug himself does not participate in their conflict. Foster-parents assume the role of natural parents, but the omission of Tailltiu's husbands from the story of Lug's upbringing - Cian simply giving her Lug to foster - leaves us with a familial microcosm of the First Battle parallel to that established for the Second: Tuatha De Danann : Fomoire -- Cian : Lug : Ethne (as mother) : : Tuatha De Danann : Fir Bolg --Cian : Lug : Tailltiu (as fosterer). The combination of these variants in LG forced them into harmony - there is thus no conflict over who Lug's mother really was - but similar processes of correlation that did not so coalesce produced several pedigrees for Finn, whose mother and father represent royalty versus aithechthuatha, the super- natural versus mortals, or (by transverse correlation) the supernatural versus the aithechthuatha.126 We have seen then that even where LG approximates prehistory, the similarity is probably coincidental, and that the invasion-saga of the Tuatha D6 Danann involves far more complex literary processes than the mere euhemerization of pagan mythology: a complete merger between the natural and the supernatural, which creates a new synthesis and a new mythology. This comprises a system of implicit analogy based on the correlation of aetiological conflicts in (and between) this world and the Other, which is further complicated by the movement of the Tuatha D6 Danann into the sid, and the resulting ambiguity of both in Irish tradition. Much confusion, 125Marie-Louise Sjoestedt, Gods and Heroes of the Celts, trans. Myles Dillon (London 1949), 81ff.

Reconstruction being one lesson learned from structural linguistics, it is time we learned another: that a language cannot be understood in a purely diachronic way. The synchronic analysis of text and tradition is a necessary complement (indeed a prerequisite) to the uncovering of what lies behind them. Combined with the biblical myths of Noachic origins and Exodic migra- tion, this aetiological conflict yields a narrative astonishingly similar to what comparative philology and archaeology have taught us to envision as fact, but the invasion-myth has always had this appeal. The frequency of popula- tion-movements, the plethora of ethno-linguistic groups even within these islands, and the sustained contacts between Ireland and the Continent during the early Middle Ages - no doubt for as long as anyone could remember - created an environment receptive to migration-myths and racial theories of culture. To the authors of LG, biblical history was not only authoritative but repeated with variations all around them. If we see history in the Milesian legend we make the same leap of faith, arguing from its similarity to the Celtic migrations - insofar as we know anything about them - rather than from actual evidence. And there is none, as far as I can see, not otherwise explainable as biblical pastiche or scholarly inference. Occam's Razor excludes memory as an additional source. Once the Milesian genealogies and migration-myth had taken shape, tradi- tions concerning the non-Milesians and the origins of the Irish polity earthly and supernatural - were adapted to fit them. According to Mac N6ill's theory, the ancestors of the aithechthuatha were incorporated before the gods, whose final induction into the scheme drew the political and super- natural conflicts into a single narrative pattern: the struggle for sovereignty. This, proper to either or a conflation of both, remains the product of their fusion, the prehistoric sources of which must be disentangled and re- constructed with great care. The tradition we have examined comprises neither historical record nor pagan mythology as such, but a synthesis of medieval learning, native and international, which illustrates, like the neigh- bouring Arthurian cycle, the generic continuity between mythography and historiography as efforts (albeit under different critical disciplines) to give significant form to the accidents of experience. TRACT III: HISTORY INTO MYTH The most complete versions of tract III (based on p) end close to the dawn of Irish history, in a twilight period animated by personages of doubt- ful status.127 Treating kings, gods and figments in much the same way, 127See part I, note 112 (pp 118f.). A New History of Ireland accepts obits for Nath I mac Fiachrach (CXV, ob. 445) and Loegaire mac N6ill (CXVI, ob. 461/3); the chronology of Niall Noigiallach (CXIV) is dubious, however, and the kings before him are omitted, as are sixteen of those listed in tract V(A).</page><page sequence="46">46 R. MARK SCOWCROFT LG gives little help to the modern historian, who must draw the line between invention and record (at least before the sixth century) almost as an act of faith. The agreement of genealogies and chronicles counts for little here, reflecting merely the consensus of authors who also agreed on the descent of their kings from Noah. For this period, in fact, the truth lurks more probably behind conflicting testimony, but is still quite hazardous to re- construct. Like the rest of LG, however, this tract has a coherence reflecting the attitudes of its authors toward the work they had undertaken, attitudes conditioned to a great extent by the political order of their own day. Look- ing back into this pseudo-historical murk, we stand more or less where they did, casting the light of what they knew upon the obscurities of tradition. Theoretically the outcome but methodologically the foundation of the pre- history they reconstructed, contemporary reality generated aetiological myth. Though worthless as testimony to pre-Patrician history, therefore, tract III tells us much about medieval Irish historiography. Common to m and b - thus to be postulated for w - is a genealogical scheme uniting the major dynasties and tuatha of early medieval Ireland, apparently according to their political and geographical proximity to the Ui Neill. Emerging more clearly in b is a recurrent pattern, based on this genea- logy, according to which the principal line of descent from Erem6n to Loe- gaire mac Neill enjoys a sovereignty interrupted three times and shared in each of the resulting four eras with a cadet branch from which descend the kings of a c6iced. Thus the descendants of lrem6n and fiber (whence the kings of Munster) share the sovereignty until theflaithius Ulad (descend- ants of ir mac Miled), which lasts for seven generations (or 100 years) between the reigns of Nuadu Find Fail (XXXI) and Ugaine M6r (LVI). Two of the latter's many children, Cobthach Coel Breg (LVIII) and Loeg- aire Lorc (LVII, whence the Laigin and Osraige), establish dynasties that share the sovereignty until a cess ('debility') that afflicts them between the reigns of i~nna Aignech (LXXIII) and Eochu Feidlech (LXXXII).128 There- after, the descendants of inna and his brother, Fiachu Fer Mara (whence the Ulidian kingdoms of medieval Ireland and Scotland), share the sov- ereignty until the slaying of Fiachu Findoilches (or Findfolaid, XCIII) by the provincial kings (c6icedaig). His son, Tuathal Techtmar (XCV), re- conquers Ireland, and from him descend the Airgialla, the Connachta, and the Ui Neill. The Airgialla never control the kingship of Tara - surviving only as tuatha tributary to the Ui N6ill129 - but tract V portrays it as '28This cess appears only in b573bis. Macalister's translation requires emending the text to read cis ('tribute'); compare Bruiden Maic Da Rto, §3, in which the saerchlanna must submit to a daerchisfognuma ('tributary rent of service') which was attached to the lands they seized from the aithechthuatha. Since both texts turn immediately to their revolt against the saerchlanna (b594bis and §4 respectively) cis may indeed be the original word, but the error, common to all copies of b, must still be regarded as its doctrine, unexplained but not impossible (cf. Cess/ Noinden Ulad). 129The sole exception is Colla Uais (CIX) in p607, one of the three Collas credited with the overthrow of Emain Machae and the foundation of Airgialla. See Byrne, Irish Kings and High- Kings, 72f., on whom I also rely for the historical information that follows.</page><page sequence="47">LEABHAR GABHALA 47 shared by the descendants of Niall Noigiallach (CXIV) and of Fiachrae (whence the Connachta), sons of Eochu Mugmed6n (CXII). Since b con- cludes tract III with an explanation of their relationship, and p with the reign of Nath I mac Fiachrach (CXV), we may credit the tract as a whole with the anticipation of this fourth era and fourth provincial dynasty, and thus with the completion of the scheme. This, which agrees broadly with the doctrine of the Genealogies, is illustrated in Fig. 4.130 Although p comprises the more systematic and comprehensive treatment of the Tara kingship - a genealogical tapestry as it were, woven out of every available lineage - the notes in b explore more fully the implications of the common pedigree, describing the chicid and their kings as subdivisions of a central kingship and offshoots from a single dynasty. The result is less an idealization of Irish politics than the mythologization of the status quo. The tendency to envision pairs of lineages alternating in the Tara kingship - as in Scythia (yp110) and the Maeotic Marshes (p115) - reflects the con- sistent practice of two Ui Neill septs, Cenel nt ogain and Clann Cholmain, between 734 and 1002 (interrupted only once, by Congalach of Sil nAedo Slaine, in 944-56), and the sequence of genealogical bifurcations matches Irish political geography during the same period. At that time, Erem6n's and tber's halves, more commonly referred to as Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga, had little to do with each other at all.13' Leinster had long since lost Tara to the Ui N6ill, but recalled its claims and its descent from Erem6n in the archaic poems that first display the Milesian pedigree.132 Genealogi- cally northern and geographically southern, therefore, the Laigin emerge from it between Leth Moga and the Ulaid. The latter had been reduced by '30See O'Brien, CGH, especially 123f. (Rig trenn, the royal descendants of trem6n), 187f. (Minigud Senchais Ehir), and 275f. (Senchas Sil Ir), king-lists that are interwoven in p along with the descendants of Lugaid mac itha (VIII, XXXIV, XLIV, XLVI, and LII), the kings numbered LXXXII-XC, and a few others. The tract entitled Rig Erenn agrees almost exactly with the archaic Leinster poems (see notes 41 and 132), which list royal descendants of Erem6n down to Labraid Loingsech (LIX) and his descendants (as kings of Tara and/or Leinster) down to Nad Buidb; only four of the latter are reckoned kings of Tara by p (LXII, LXIX, LXXIV, and LXXXV). 13ltrem6n's half is identified as Leth Cuinn in a401. The origin-legend of Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga is preserved in L, fol. 167roa29-b5 (ed. Vernam Hull, 'togan M6r and Conn Cetchathach', ZCP 19 (1933), 59-61), where the division, roughly a line between Dublin and Galway (see note 70), is made by Conn Cetchathach and Mog Nuadat (alias togan M6r); a variant tradition, ascribing it to Art mac Cuinn (CI) and togan mac Ailella Auloimm (from whom descend the toganachta of Munster, like the Connachta from Conn), is edited by Maiirin O Daly in Cath Maige Mucrama, ITS, L (1975), §§39ff; other sources and references are collected by O'Rahilly in EIHM, 184ff. Memories of a more ancient polity may survive in the division of Ireland by Sobairce and Cermna (IX) in b551bis, which is marked by a line running from Inber Colptha (the Boyne estuary: see note 14) to Limerick. This restores County Clare to Connacht and southern Meath (including Tara) to Leinster. The division made by trem6n and tber is not described geographically in LG, but their landing at Inber Scene (see note 38) and Erem6n's subsequent voyage to Inber Colptha (m466, a397, b418) may be seen to favour the same boundary-line. 132See especially 'Nidu dir dermait dila cach rig r6mdae', ed.

Emerging thus in succession from the Milesian pedigree are the rivals, satel- lites, and kinsmen of the Ui Neill. To these, who go on to split in turn, each bifurcation in the pedigree brings us closer, politically and geographically. The Tara kingship emerges from a series of bisections that distinguish it from each c6iced in succession (see Fig. 5). This scheme derives ultimately from Laginian tradition, but inverts its implicit purpose. While the Leinster poems claim Milesian origins and the kingship of Tara, LG redefines the Laigin as descendants of Loegaire Lorc, presents his brother's descendants as a continuation of the principal royal line, and thus turns the loss of Tara into the emergence of Leinster. This transformation of the Laginian king-list into a national pedigree with a Laginian cadet branch probably inspired the attachment of others, and thus the scheme as a whole. LG also reduces the northern Laigin (as Gaileoin) to aithechthuatha who, along with the subject populations of Connacht (Fir Bolg and Fir Domnann), had founded the c6icid and the Tara kingship but had since suffered conquest and a decline in status.133 These revisions left the Laginian descendants of trem6n dwelling entirely in Eber's half of the country. The line between Leth Cuinn and Leth Moga really marks the southern boundary of Sil Cuinn - the Connachta and Ui Neill - which is straddled politically by Leinster's claims to the midlands. By the dawn of Irish history the most powerful dynasty in the north - perhaps in Ireland - the Ui N6ill were nevertheless unable to claim the kingship of a cdiced. Hence the subordination of the c6icid to a high-king- ship of Ireland with its capital at Tara; hence a's claim that the c6icedaig, even if equal in power, can never be equal in right (comcheirt) to the children of Tuathal Techtmar (a593, b594bis). Thus transforming a parvenu state carved out of ancient c6icid into the polity that founded them, the literati might incur modern censure as propagandists for the Ui NMill, but are really historical determinists projecting the status quo back into pedigrees that render it inevitable and political events that render it normative. Inventing a past in the absence of historical records, they differ of course from modern historians, who can select from such records the likely antecedents to events and conditions, but both rely on accepted principles of cause and effect, making an effort equally honest. The discipline of the literati is finally more mythopoeic than analytical, however: the reconstruction of causes from known effects. This is not propaganda, which seeks by deliberate falsifica- tion or manipulation of evidence to achieve a certain end. In any case, the 'end' implied by LG had been achieved long before it was written, and if it 133In historical times, the largest areas inhabited by Fir Bolg and Fir Domnann were in Galway and Mayo respectively (see Hogan, Onomasticon, s. nn Bolgthuath Badhna, Bolgthuath Eachtge, Irrus Domnann, and Fir Domnann); Fir Bolg also dwelt in Roscommon (Onomasticon, s. n. Fir Bolg). For other descendants named by LG, see part I, note 87 (p. 108).

Although m does not allude to these (three) interregna, it represents the relevant periods as dominated for the most part by kings drawn from the cadet branches, and flanked by scions of the main line. About b's cess a says nothing, but p572-9 fills it with descendants of Eber and Ir ruling in alternation;'34 the latter dynasty inaugurates the flaithius Ulad in a and, according to genealogical tradition includes the slayers (and successors) of Fiachu Findoilches and Tuathal Techtmar.135 It is here that the children of Ir find a place in the politico-genealogical scheme. 134Crimthann Coscrach (LXXIV), the first king of Tara to rule during the cess, belongs in genealogical tradition to the Laginian branch of the pedigree, but LG identifies him with no branch at all (though c571 names his father and grandfather). The ancestry of the other kings (LXXV-LXXXI) is clearly stated. 13SThe genealogies (and kings) of this line are collected in the Senchas Sil Ir (ed. O'Brien, CGH, 269ff).

T. F. O'Rahilly argues that they were a late addition to it, being Cruithin of Ulster ethnically distinct from and long subordinated to the kings of that province, who were northern Erainn.'36 The Cruithin of Ulster retained sovereign status during the early historical period chiefly in Dal nAraidi and Ui Echach Cobo, which occasionally seized the kingship of the province (hence their addition to the Milesian pedigree) and are credited in b571bis with thirty kings of Tara, but the majority were aithech- thuatha subject to Ulidian or Ui N6ill rule.'37 Legends of ancient glory find expression in the Ulster Cycle, theflaithius Ulad, and the epithet 'true Ulster- men of Emain' (fir-Ulaid Emna, e.g. in y573 and b573bis) by which these old Ulidians distinguished themselves from the Dal Fiatach, Dal Riata, et al.138 Such claims present the same challenge as the c6icedaig to a medieval polity equating rights with inheritance and the status quo with immemorial tradition, and are integrated into it here in the same way, with a myth of revolt and restoration. As the present unfolds, it suffers interruptions accom- modating the remembered or traditional past. As a population once sovereign but now reduced to aithechthuatha, the Cruithin of Ulster resemble LG's Fir Bolg, Fir Domnann, and Gailoin, but Dal nAraidi belongs to the saerchlanna Erenn and merits therefore a Milesian pedigree.'39 The children of Ir thus straddle a fundamental politi- cal distinction which Irish historians had interpreted as genealogical, even racial, and can thus, according to a, lead c6icedaig instead of aithechthuatha in revolt against the kings of Tara (a591-3, b594bis). To this variant b adds the revolt of the aithechthuatha itself, interpolating it into the reign of Eochu Feidlech (LXXXII, 594bis), and a copy of Mael Muru Othna's poem. Both versions of the revolt portray it as violating a treaty imposed by Ugaine M6r (LVI) - in o after the flaithius Ulad - and the interpolation duplicates details of his reign already set forth in a554 and b554bis. Though the in- terpolation does not include Tuathal's reconquest of Ireland, the poem and its analogues describe it in much the same way as does a his defeat of the b551bis) - and four of Lugaid mac itha. Though this tally does not suggest Ulidian pre- eminence, the small number of kings descended from lrem6n is certainly significant. During the periods considered normal by a, kings of that ancestry make up at least one third and usually more than half of the total. 136EIHM, 341-52. We have seen (in note 49) that traditions concerning the sons of Mil seem to support O'Rahilly's contention. It is also noteworthy that so many and such various origin-legends are assigned to the Irish and Scottish Picts. In LG, the children of Ir are never called Cruithin, but the Cruithnig of Scotland make an appearance during the reign of trem6n (tract III(A)). '37They are listed as such in the tracts on the aithechthuatha edited by 0 Raithbheartaigh, Genealogical Tracts I, 107ff. 38 Byrne calls attention to the obverse of this distinction in the Annals of Ulster, which refer to Ulster kings from Dal nAraidi or Ui Echach Cobo as kings of the province (rig in chbicid) rather than kings of Ulster or the Ulstermen (rig Ulad); see Irish Kings and High-Kings, 108. 13"See a573, b571bis, and ctCXI, which group the eponymous Araide with Conn and togan as 'tri saeir Harenn'. The three represent the descendants of Mil's three sons (see also note 131).</page><page sequence="52">52 R. MARK SCOWCROFT coicedaig (a593, b594bis). It seems clear then that a adapted the story of Tuathal Techtmar and the aithechthuatha to an opposition more central to the concerns of tract III, using the ambiguous status of Sil nIr and the king of Tara's ex officio role as chief of the saerchlanna to facilitate the analogy. This accounts in turn for c's transfer of Elim mac Conrach (XCIV) from Sil nir to the Fir Bolg (591) or the Fir Domnann (593a), but he still acts in concert with the c6icedaig, slaying Fiachu Findfolaid on Mag mBolg after they have prepared forhim the feast that proves fatal in Bruiden Maic Da Reo.140 The ambiguous or dual role of the rebels, however, is implicit already in Mael Muru Othna's poem, and deserves consideration therefore as an in- tegral part of the tradition, aspects of which gain prominence in subsequent retellings of the story. According to the poem, Elim mac Conrach, king of Ulster, has the support of the three other c6icedaig against the children of UJgaine, viz. Foirbre mac Fine of Munster, Eochaid Anchenn of Leinster, and Sanb mac Ceitt meic Mtagach of Connacht. When Tuathal returns, he fights most of his battles against Fir Bolg, Fir Domnann and Gtaileoin. In fact, Mael Muru refers to Leinster as the Gailkoin (v. 25) and to Connacht as Fir 01 nEcmacht (v. 51), thus specifying non-Milesian populations; Foir- bre mac Fine belongs to the descendants of Lugaid mac Itha, who play a role in the south similar to that of Sil nlr in the north,'41 being sovereign tuatha distinct from and less important than the great descendants of lber or lirem6n. Thus correlating oppositions between the saerchlanna and the aithechthuatha on the one hand, and the kings of Tara and the c6icedaig on the other, Mael Muru offers scope for the development of either in subse- quent versions, but also a powerful analogy inviting the provincial kings to recognize the Tara kingship in the same way as their own subject popu- lations recognize them: rig Temro: c6icedaig: : saerchlanna: aithechthuatha. We have seen then that the historical content of tract III corresponds not to the period it treats but to that of its composition, and is implicit therefore in its own origin-legend. This focusses on Tara as the political centre of Ireland and the Ui Neill and their ancestors as her sovereign dynasty. Their relationships with the other polities of the early medieval period emerge in the filiations of the Milesian pedigree, as does vindication for the alternating rule of Cenel nEogain and Clann Cholmain in a series of such alternations between the principal royal line and its cadet branches. From these descend the provincial kings whose challenges to the supremacy of Tara supply an aetiology both for the fact of Irish disunity and for the ambitions of the Ui Neill. The cult of Tara and the myth of the high-kingship have obscure 140The slaying of Fiachu on Mag mBolg (c591) is mentioned also in pCXV:132 and in the fragment of m preserved in Rawlinson B 502, p. 136a48f.

One savours then the irony of the myth's fulfilment, when Brian B6ruma (CLVIII, reg. 1002-14), the scion of aithech- thuatha from Leth Moga, becomes the first king of Tara in a unified Ireland. PARTHOLON AND NEMED Historia Brittonum (n) comprises the earliest extant version of the LG tradition, but poses problems for the student of LG itself, and deserves reconsideration in its own right. After discussing the six ages of the world (nl- 6) and the geography of Britain (n7-9), Nennius enumerates the peoples who invaded her. He begins with the eponymous Britto, great-grandson of Eneas, wandering in exile after the accidental (but prophesied) slaying of his father (nl0f.); moves on to the Picts, who occupied the Orkneys and from there conquered a third of Britain (n12); and concludes finally ('novissime') with the migrations of the Irish from Spain (n 13) and their colonies in Britain (n 14), paragraphs which I quote below. A version of tract I follows (n 15), along with a remark on the danger posed by the Picts and the Irish to the Britons before Rome established its world-kingdom. After synchronisms (n16) and an alternative British origin-legend, beginning with Noah's sons and focussing on the eponymous Brutus, likewise a descendant of AEneas (nl7f.), Nennius settles down to his main topic, British relations with the Romans and Saxons. For ease of reference, I have divided Mommsen's text of nl3f. into smaller units, and mention only significant variae lectiones in the notes that follow it. nl 13(a) Novissime autem Scotti venerunt a partibus Hispaniae ad Hiberniam.

Like 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel', n belongs clearly to the LG tradition, agreeing with the canon even about matters of detail - the death of the Partholonians by plague in a single week, Nemed's survival of massive ship- wreck and an eighteen-month journey, the Milesians' thirty ships142 but diverging from it as often in important ways. In addition to the three invaders listed by n13, scholars since Zimmer have recognized in nl4c the flight of the Fir Bolg from Mag Tuired to the islands (F281, F308, b291).143 Builc, however, has no obvious connection with Nimeth, whose people return to Spain - not their place of origin in LG - and occupies Eubonia (the Isle of Man) and other islands more or less contemporaneously with the Irish colonization of Scotland and Wales.'44 An adventure very similar to the Nemetian encounter with the golden tower in b248, and survived like Togail Tuir Chonaind by thirty warriors in a single ship (a243, b256, H270), 142For Partholon see a205 and b221, and compare his 5000 men and 4000 women with the 4000 people in nl3b; for Nemed see a237 and b248. The Milesians arrive with 36 chieftains in 30 ships (a385), which m467 has no doubt tidied up to 36 in 36 (there is no such enumeration in b). irem6n and Eber, when dividing Ireland, each have 30 warriors in m466f. and 30 ships in a397 and b402 (cf. also the 30 in each of Nemed's 34 ships in b248). '43Nennius Vindicatus, 221; Gilla Coemiin confirms this hypothesis in Lebor Bretnach, §13, adding to his translation of nI4c the islands colonized by the Fir Bolg in # (on which see part I, note 86 (p. 108)). Builc is the personification of the population-name Builg, which is equi- valent in Irish onomastics to Fir Bolg (see O'Rahilly, EIHM, 43ff). For further details of Zimmer's interpretation, see note 150. 144Dalrieta is the Irish kingdom of Dal Riata, which colonized Argyll in Scotland at the beginning of the medieval period, but Lebor Bretnach (§13) portrays 'Istoreth mac Istoirine' as leading the 'descendants of Gaileon' (clanna Gdilkoin). Compare Stariath and Starn, ancestors of the Fir Bolg according to ScOl Tutin meic Cairill (§10) and LG (see Fig. 2) respectively. A variant of the latter name, Starin, appears metrically fixed in a poem added by Lebor na hUidre to Scel Tuain (see Meyer's edn in The Voyage of Bran, II (London 1897), p. 288, verse 3). Latinizations of these names, with British inorganic i- before the initial st- of both (on which see Henry Lewis and Holger Pedersen, A Concise Comparative Celtic Grammar (Gdttin- gen 1937), §25(5)), would yield the forms in n, thus testifying to the naturalization of this tradition (or at least the names) in Britain. Its fusion with the historical colonization of Scotland results no doubt from their geographical proximity. The £oganachta are generally thought to have established colonies in south-west Wales during the same period, and Gwyr and Cydweli (Anglice Gower and Kidwelly, west of Swansea) may have formed part of them (see Cecile O'Rahilly, Ireland and Wales (London 1924), 35ff, and Wendy Davies, Wales in the Early Middle Ages (Leicester 1982), 87f., 95). The Ui Liathain were a sept of the iEoganachta located by Irish documents in what is now the barony of Barrymore, Co. Cork (Hogan, Onomasticon, 673), but Cormac's Glossary explains a Cornish 'Dind Map Lethain' as 'Din Maic Liathain' (ed. Meyer, §883; Stokes, p. 29).</page><page sequence="55">LEABHAR GABHALA 55 is in nl3e attached to the Milesians. What follows in nl3f-14a is highly obscure and probably corrupt, though Zimmer's interpretation of Dam- hoctor as the Irish phrase d&amp;m ochtair 'a group of eight people' recalls LG's Noachic population-myth.145 He identifies this octad with the primelathnaig of the Tuatha De Danann, thus discovering testimony to all of the postdiluvian invaders.146 This and other such efforts invariably produce confusion, which is just as invariably blamed on Nennius. Zimmer's invaders are out of order, and Damhoctor colonizes the wrong island. Even if we follow the recommendations of Gilla Coemain and Macalister, emending 'Brittannia(m)' to 'Hibernia(m)', we must then explain who this post-Milesian octad is.147 Though naming the eight primelathnaig in Lebor Bretnach (§12), Gilla Coematin makes no at- tempt to connect them with dtim ochtair in §13. Indeed, his revision of n13 in §12 prepares us for the Milesian invasion in §13, and this may be what he understood ditm ochtair to signify.'4a In any case, his assignment of n I 3e to the Tuatha D6 Danann shows that he did not feel constrained by the canon of LG.149 This story has been taken to represent Togail Tuir Chonaind (and n14 the subsequent diaspora), but it more closely resembles the disastrous adventure that befell the Nemetians on their way to Ireland (b248), and probably originated as a marginal addendum to n l3c, incorporated subsequently into 145Nennius Vindicatus, 221f.; the word is interpreted correctly in Lebor Bretnach, §13. 146Van Hamel has reservations about this hypothesis but does not suggest an alternative ('On Lebor Gabala', 164). Macalister, while recognizing many such octads in the LG tradition, derives them from 'a primary group of eight deities', proposes that this one should properly come 'in Hiberniam' rather than 'in Brittania(m)', and declares the paragraph a 'bad memory' of the scattering of the Fir Bolg (LGE, II, 250f.). O'Rahilly argues that this octad was intended to be Milesian -- though properly Partholonian -but also that nl3f refers to the Fir Bolg; their emigration in nl4c implies the invasion of the Tuatha D6 Danann, but n13-15 is on the whole 'very confused' (EIHM, 475f.). 147See Lebor Bretnach, §13, and LGE, II, 250. Macalister argues that nl4a originally read 'novissime venit Damhoctor'; subsequently, 'in Brittanniam' (recte 'Hiberniam') was added by one scribe and the rest of the sentence by another; the latter addition was interpolated awk- wardly, hence nl4a as we have it (I discuss this passage in greater detail below). As variae lectiones nos 6 and 8 show, the phrase 'in Brittannia(m)' appears in all copies of the text and should not be arbitrarily changed, especially if the emendation creates additional problems for the understanding of the whole. Claiming finally that nl3d refers to the Fir Bolg - though nl3e should be Nemetian - Macalister pleads that 'Nennius evidently quotes some of it from memory, and has confused certain of the details'. 148In §12 he omits nl3a, reproduces nl3b--c (adding that the Nemetians fled from muiridi, 'seafarers', which one recension glosses as Fomoire), adds the invasions of the Fir Bolg and Tuatha De Danann, and attaches n l3e to the latter; he omits nl3d and n13f altogether, and ddrm ochtair appears, therefore, where we would expect Milesians. In §13 he brings them to Ireland instead of Britain (as in nl4a), combines nl4b and nl4c, brings in the Pictish invasion (as in n12), and concludes with nl4d. To the African itinerary of the 'vir nobilis de Scythia' in n15 - which is based on Orosius, 1.2.83, 88-93 (see Edmond Faral, La lIgende arthurienne: Etudes et documents (Paris 1929), I, 204, note 1) - he adds a first stop in Scythia. These changes are consistent with the view that Gilla Coemain knew p and other elements of the tradition, but not tract II (or a) itself. 149The author of a subsequent recension (van Hamel's version II) adds to the end of this narrative a sentence noting the alternative version associated with Fergus Lethderg and the children of Nemed: thus Togail Tuir Chonaind rather than the golden tower in b248.</page><page sequence="56">56 R. MARK SCOWCROFT the wrong place.150 If we remove it from the text, nl3d supplies a subject for the verbs in nl3f, and thus rescues it from incoherence: the Milesians came to Ireland, stayed for a year, and returned later to settle permanently. In nl4a, then, 'novissime' concludes the series of Irish migrations introduced by n13a (in which 'novissime' concludes the series of migrations to the islands as a whole). The octad refers, in true Noachic style, to the three lineages that follow, and is thus analogous to the Nemetian diaspora but not derived from it. Indeed, since these three colonizations reflect historical reality, they might even have set a pattern for the Nemetian ones, which do not. This interpretaton of nl3e, n13d and f, and n14 also resolves the textual difficulties in nl4a. In the interest of sense, Mommsen departs here from his favourite text (that in H and K), but it represents the archetype more ac- curately than the reading he has chosen. I believe that the original sentence read 'novissime venit Damhoctor in Brittanniam'; the rest was a scribal addition, marginal or interlinear, later incorporated wrongly into the text, Brittanniam being the proper antecedent to ibi.'5' Contradicting the testi- mony of nl4d to the expulsion of the Irish from Wales, the clause betrays a misunderstanding of nl4a as an introduction to what follows, and is thus to be rejected from the text as originally composed. This an editor should represent as follows: Novissime venit Damhoctor ' in Brittanniam 2: Notes: Isc. et ibi habitavit cum omni genere suo (sc. quod superest MN) usque hodie MSS; 2in Brittannia CDGLPQ; om. MN. The interpolation left ibi without an antecedent - except for 'regiones plu- rimas' in nl3f which, referring ostensibly to 'Hibernia' in nl3e, contradicts 'in Brittanniam' - so one scribe (whence CDGLPQMN) changed 'in Brit- tanniam' from the destination of venit to the location of habitavit, thus supplanting but neglecting to expunge ibi; another (whence MN) then moved the phrase to the end of nl3f, where it provides the correct antecedent for ibi but generates a Spanish invasion of Britain. Zimmer, Lot and O'Ra- hilly repunctuate Mommsen's text (based here on CDGLPQ), moving the phrase to the beginning of nl4b, but thus produce an awkward sentence and in n 4a an otherwise unknown post-Milesian invasion of Ireland.'52 S15Compare the argument of Zimmer, who supposes that Nennius, summarizing a copy of LG, skipped pages inadvertently between the composition of nl3c and n13d, realized his mis- take, and went back to Togail Tuir Chonaind, thus bringing in Damhoctor and Builc after his summary of the Milesian invasion (Nennius Vindicatus, 221). This ingenious hypothesis fails to account, however, for the Nemetian return to Spain, nl3f, Damhoctor's invasion of Britain, and the absence of a proper invasion for the Fir Bolg. See also van Hamel, 'On Lebor Gabila', 155ff; Macalister, LGE, II, 250; and O'Rahilly, EIHM, 493f. Most recognize the similarities between nl3e and b248 but, insisting on those between n14 and the Nemetian diaspora, ignore the conclusion to n 13e and declare it a primitive Togail Tuir Chonaind. 150 ICompare Macalister's analysis of this sentence, which I summarize in note 147. 152Nennius Vindicatus, 221; Ferdinand Lot, Nennius et 'Historia Brittonum (Paris 1934), 157; EIHM, 476, note 2.</page><page sequence="57">LEABHAR GABHALA 57 The virtue of the hypothesis presented here is that, textual complexities notwithstanding, it postulates (and reconstructs) coherence in the original whole. Reading n as legitimate testimony to the LG tradition rather than a con- fused version of the text, we are left then with three invaders of Ireland and a population-group (Builc) which was later to be added as a fourth; the Tuatha De Danann, as Mac Neill has shown, accrue fifth, and the ante- diluvians thereafter. We have seen how the invasion-myth stimulates the spread of features from one personage or group to its typological equivalent, but the original three invaders form a special group within this system, sharing distinctive characteristics and standing apart occasionally from all others. Nennius describes them in nl3a as Scotti invading Ireland from Spain, and we have seen behind their Greek affiliations in LG the remarks of Isidore about the Greek origins of the Gallaeci.s53 The three land at Inber Sc6ne, build forts, clear plains, and witness the emergence of rivers and lakes.154 They also provide us with the best examples of the Noachic octad: a patriarch, his wife, three sons, and their wives. Ignorant of LG itself, the reader of n13 might assume that its three invaders represented another Noachic trisection, this time of the Scythian exiles described in nl15. He would not be far wrong. In response to van Hamel's theory that Parthol6n was a corn-spirit, Thur- neysen brought together the previous work of Meyer and van Hamel himself to show how this invader originated in traditions concerning the Gaedil.5ss According to Isidore (IX.ii.24), the Parthians descended from an exiled group of Scythians; for this reason, Scythians refer to exiles in general as parthi. Compare Nennius' description of the nameless ancestor of the Gaedil (n 15): Erat vir nobilis de Scythia cum magna familia apud AEgyptios, et expulsus est a regno suo. If the epithet parthus, applied to this Scythian exile, were subsequently in- terpreted as the name Parthol6n - probably by way of an abbreviations56 - a new invader would emerge from the tradition as soon as the Scythian acquired his proper name. Parthol6n is the Irish form of Bartholomaeus 153See note 39. 154See notes 38 and 89. 155A. G. van Hamel, 'Parthol6n', RC 50 (1933), 217-33; Rudolf Thurneysen, 'Parthol6n', ZCP 20 (1933-6), 375-81. The latter develops earlier arguments made by van Hamel ('On Lebor Gabila', 181) and Kuno Meyer ('Parthol6n mac Sera', ZCP 13 (1919-21), 141f.). 156The name is consistently abbreviated by LL as par- (LL 1: 475-507; parthol- appears in 487), and by F as par-, part-, or (most commonly) parth- (foll. 5v'a27-7v0a8), which is so close to a suspension of parthus (parth3?) that one can imagine the latter being expanded ac- cordingly, especially by a scribe anticipating a name. In Lebor Bretnach, § 13, one of Cruithne's ancestors has a name spelled variously as (g. s) parthal (BB, p. 206a34), pairte (TCD MS H.3.17 (#1336), col. 809:45), pairti (Book of Ui Maine, RIA MS D.ii.1 (#1225), new fol. 36roa50), and parthalon (L, fol. 141r'a23). To judge from van Hamel's stemma (ed. cit., p. xxvii), L has here done exactly what happened early in the LG tradition, expanding a form that the other MSS show was originally the g. s. of parthus.</page><page sequence="58">58 R. MARK SCOWCROFT (hence the reading of nl3b in CDGLPQ; Partholomus is a Latinization of the Irish name); scholars trying to place this personage would naturally explore the meaning or etymology of his name, which Isidore, following St Jerome, presents as follows: 157 Bartholomaeus filius suspendentis aquas, vel filius suspendentis me. Syrum est, nomen, non Hebraeum. Parthol6n becomes thus the first invader of Ireland after the Flood, and may have appeared in its aftermath before being synchronized as part of the invasion-scheme with the beginning of the Third Age. His patronymic, mac Sera, derives similarly from the observation that Bartholomaeus is a Syrian name. Like Nemed and the Gaedil, therefore, this 'son of the Syrian' is ultimately Scythian: another common (and distinctive) feature uniting the three in- vaders. Parthol6n's patronymic (and lineage back to Esrft) can be estab- lished for a but not p, and the oldest extant version of Scel Tuain meic Cairill identifies him as a son of Agnoman and brother of Nemed; subse- quent changes bringing the other versions into conformity with ca make nonsense of Tuan's remaining claim that he was Nemed's nephew.'58 In Lebor Bretnach (§12), Gilla Coemain adds to his translation of nl3c that Nemed was another son of Agnoman: thus Parthol6n's brother. These two Scythian sons of Agnoman invite comparison with the leader of the Gaedil expelled from Scythia after slaying his cousin (plO1f.); he has two sons who establish lineages, but leads an octad on the migration that ends, generations later, in Ireland. Parthol6n similarly takes flight after slaying his parents (b211), and leads an octad to Ireland.'59 We have seen him credited in 6 with four sons named Er, Orba, Fergna, and Fer6n, who in all versions of LG appear among the Milesians. According to w, ith mac Bre- goin(d) was the first of the Gaedil to visit Ireland; the others followed to avenge his death (ac379, m465). In 2381ff, he settles a dispute at Ailech Neit among the three kings of the Tuatha D&amp; Danann, who then murder him on Mag nitha.'60 Parthol6n is said in a to have cleared 'Mag nitha la Laigniu' (a204, b214) and to have fought the battle of Mag nltha against the Fomoire (a202, b213); b212 gives him a servant named ith, who in c214 clears the plain. Where identified, the Milesian and Partholonian plains lie on opposite sides of the country (in Tirconnell and Wexford respectively), but there can 157 Etymologiae, VII.ix. 16; Liber de Nominibus Hebraicis, ed.

The precise relationship between Parthol6n and Nemed is left unstated in the revised versions, but a (to which they conform in other respects) would not permit so close a kinship between Tuan and Nemed. 'Parthalon mac Agnon' also appears in one copy of Lebor Bretnach, §13 (L, fol. 141roa23), but is not the original reading of the text (see note 156). 159This tradition may derive however from an etymology of mac Sera as mac fingalach in the glosses to 'Apraid a 6olchu Elga', by Eochaid ua Cerin (see Thurneysen, 'Partholdn', 378).

This theory not only explains the evolution of Parthol6n mac Sera and the characteristics he shares with the Milesians, but also sheds light on n 15 itself. The nameless Scythian combines the roles of N61 in w and the gener- ations from Agnoman to Brath in p: like Nel he witnesses the Exodus, like Agnoman was expelled from his Scythian home, and like Brath completes the trip to Spain. In b, the story of Mil's expulsion from Scythia, migration to Egypt, abandonment of it following an analogous disaster for Pharaoh, and wanderings to Spain (whence Ireland was colonized during his lifetime) displays a similar telescoping of events into a Mosaic chronology.'62 This probably old version of the story has been drafted into a new chronology, which synchronizes it with the empire of Alexander, and adds to it the version probably inherited from w. The latter approximates the chronology of n, but its suspiciously precise 1002 years between the Exodus and the Milesian invasion of Ireland still resist explanation within the synchronistic scheme of LG.'63 According to some authorities, however, this is exactly the interval between the Flood and the Partholonian invasion.'64 The typo- logical equivalence between the two biblical events may or may not be relevant to their apparent confusion here; what is clear is that n has not completely disentangled the two invaders. The phrase 'vir nobilis' hints at a third if Nemed represents what his name means: the upper classes (neimid), comprising secular and ecclesiasti- cal lords (saerneimid) and the professional classes (daerneimid), as distinguish- ed from rent-paying vassals (aithig). Whether by mistake (like Builc and Damhoctor) or through deliberate personification, this invader would have arisen from the Milesian prototype to function on the social level like the Fir Bolg on the political, confirming status with pedigree. Indeed, Francis John Byrne has argued that the social scheme in which the neimid figure inspired the political scheme that pitched saerthuatha and (tributary) daer- 161The Laginian Mag nitha lies south-west of Arklow in north-east County Wexford (see Hogan, Onomasticon, 522). The battle takes place in a202, however, at Slemna Maige itha, which is apparently the northern location (see note 160 and Hogan, Onomasticon, 604); cf. 'Can a mbunadus na nGaedel', in which Ith dies 'i Slemnaib' (LL III: 16050). According to b213 the Fomorian enemies of Parthol6n landed at Inber nDomnann, which is also an ono- mastic doublet for Malahide Bay, Co. Dublin, and Inber M6r in Erris, Co. Mayo (see O'Rahilly, EIHM, 99, note 2); the latter Inber nDomnann is where Genann and Rudraige of the Fir Bolg land for the occupation of Connacht und Ulster (F279, b286).

MARK SCOWCROFT thuatha against the aithechthuatha.16s The product of analogical thinking on the part of the legal tractarians, these categories may be expressed as correlative oppositions: saerthuatha dsaerthuatha : aithechthuatha (political correlative) . daerthuathae Ssaerneimid aithig (social correlative). Generally speaking, the political macrocosm reflects in many ways the social microcosm: the personal status of a king vis a vis other kings determines the status of his tuath, which descends conventionally from his ancestors; succession is the same thing as inheritance. Narratives treating the revolt and reconquest of the aithechthuatha interpret these political events entirely in terms of the leaders' own deeds: the aithechthuatha had been reduced to that status because their kings had been slain of old by the ancestors of the saerchlanna; the slaying of these kings (or the king of Tara alone) constitutes revolt, that of the usurpers restoration. In Bruiden Maic da Rko, the politi- cal term aithechthuatha is interchangeable with the social term aithig. LG does not concern itself with the aetiology of these particular social classes - though the curious definition of gods as the skilled (aes ddna) and non-gods as husbandmen (aes trebtha) approximates the distinction between neimid and aithig 166 - but the saga of the Fir Bolg appears to comprise a transverse correlation of neimid versus aithechthuatha in the slaying of Eoch- aid mac Eirc by the three sons of Nemed mac Badrui.'67 The latter appear '5lrish Kings and High-Kings, 45f., 175.

Compare also Sctl Tudin (§12), where reference is made to 'divine and non-divine tribes' (tuatha dt 7 andt), and Thin B6 Clalnge from the Book of Leinster, ed. Cecile O'Rahilly (Dublin 1967), 11 2111-13, where the distinction is equated with 'folk of power' (aes cumachta) and husbandmen (aes trebaire). The aes ddna of the gods include their kings - as the epiphany of Lug in CMT (§§53-74) amply illustrates - and neimid in the broad sense include the aes dhna of Irish society. '67This spelling of Nemed's patronymic is confirmed for m303 by R and Y (against Y's conjugate, L); for y by the agreement of LL280 (against F and c296: thus against f) and the inconsistency of F, which endorses it in 308 (against BB360; Lc in revising this passage omits the patronymic); and for cw by the agreement of EY289 (against R and D; Lb is defective here). All divergent MSS have Bad(h)rai, which may be considered the lectio facilior either as a later spelling of Badrui or as its reinterpretation as a masculine io-stem. The name rhymes with roi, tai, and ri in the various recensions of aXLVII:8c-d (and cCXV:23c-d), and has suffered orthographic mutilation to render the correspondence more obvious, but this (deibide) metre does not actually require that the final syllable agree in length with these long monosyllables (see e.g. n6: Luachro [sic] in XLVII:12a-b and ri: Rudraigi in pCXV:14a-b). The original spelling is also endorsed by later authors such as Dubhiltach Mac Fir Bhisigh and Geoffrey Keating, who modernize it as Badhraoi (0 Raithbheartaigh (ed.), Genealogical Tracts I, p. 57, §91; Forus Feasa ar Firinn, I.ix.26). Peculiar both as a personal name and as a genitive, Badrui originated probably as Nemed's epithet; compare Cruind ba Drui in the Senchas Sil Ir (ed. O'Brien, CGH, 277, 323-7; cf. also 400, 412). The interpolation of mac by a scribe who mis- interpreted this epithet turned it into a name.</page><page sequence="61">LEABHAR GABHALA 61 nowhere else in the Mythological Cycle - not even in subsequent versions of LG's theogony - and join the Tuatha De Danann here no doubt as an accident of their induction into the invasion-scheme. The saga of the Fir Bolg originally described their defeat by the sovereign races, here identi- fied with the neimid but properly the political correlative of that social class, which thus finds a racial correlative in the Milesians. This Nemed being but a doublet of the invader, I would suggest that the evolution of LG turned the Fir Bolg into descendants of their proper conquerors. This peculiar development satisfied the need to give the Fir Bolg a Noachic (but non-Milesian) ancestry: they were attached, along with the Britons and Tuatha De Danann, to the only pre-Milesian invader thought (at least by n) to have left descendants.168 As happened when Parthol6n split away from the Milesians, or the First Battle of Mag Tuired from the Second, doublets resulted. The Neme- tians defeat the Fomorian kings Gann and Sengann (a239, b253), and later wage war against Morc mac Deled (a243, b256, cXLII:5f., pCXV:10); Gann and Sengann, sons of (g. s.) Dela son of L6t(h), later rule over the Fir Bolg et al. (m303, a280, b288, cxXLVII:3f., pCXV:20f.), and that specific race descends from them in #f (F279, b287).169 The same recension refers to those defeated at C6tchath Maige Tuired (and wander- ing thereafter) as the sons of Um6r (F281, b291, ILI); from Um6r (aliter Gim6r) in bXXXIII descends Parthol6n's Fomorian enemy Cicol, whose mother's name is L6t(h) Luamnach. Because the slaying of Eochaid mac Eirc now coincided with the revolt of the fratres magi in Persia, the new Nemed was identified as a drui, the name and epithet 'Nemed ba Drui' subsequently generating the name and patronymic 'Nemed mac Badrui'.'70 The three brothers, sons of a druid, slew Eochaid when the fratres magi ('druidi' in s302) slew Cambyses. The split story thus produ- ced two each of Nemed (and his octad), Gann, Sengann, (g. s.) De- la/Deled, L6t(h), and Uimbr, the extras being assigned to the supernatural race analogous with their own in the invasion-myth. We have seen a number of features uniting the Nemetians with the Mile- sians (and Partholonians), and setting them apart as a group within the analogical scheme of LG. To these we may add a tract preserved in L (fol. 183voal-35) which brings them together at the Exodus. Introduced by the question of who first colonized Ireland, the text moves quickly from the 16IMael Muru Othna is the first datable source for the descent of the Fir Bolg from Nemed (assuming that the two prepositional phrases in LL III:16096 stand in apposition); Sctl Tubin (§7) describes an invasion of the Fir Bolg, but does not trace them back to Nemed, whose race dies out entirely. 1'69LG does not preserve nominatives for Dela (DiP) or Deled (Deil?), but the vagaries of early orthography could certainly produce two genitives from a single name. Deled rhymes with (a. s.) ler in aXLII:6a-b, but F, BB, and Y255 treat it as an o-stem, palatalizing the final consonant. The lenition of the final consonant in Loth is not always indicated; according to M. A. O'Brien, the vowel is long (CGH, 676, s. n.). 170On the form and origin of Badrui see note 167.

Though distinguishing 'our race' (ar centl-ni) from Nemed's, the author describes the latter participating in the construction of Nimrod's Tower, suffering enslavement thereafter, and witnessing the drowning of Pharaoh in the Red Sea. To this Milesian narrative he adds traces of genuine Nemetian lore: a journey to Ireland survived only by an octad, the disastrous adventure of the tower in the sea. More than LG itself, this tract testifies to the Milesian origins of Nemed, who brought thence a variant of the legend as a whole. Juxtaposing the now separate invaders as they enact together the Milesian legend, the author adapts his material to the doctrine of the canon. Nemed leaves traces finally in the genealogies of p, which preserve a Milesian counterpart to his pedigree. In Fig. 6 I have broken down these two lineages, separating the common framework, Esrii-Sri-Taitt-Agno- man-Nemed, from the sequence Eber-Ogaman-Alld6it, which is added twice to the Milesian pedigree, and from other additions. We have seen that Lebor Bretnach and the oldest extant version of Sckl Tudin meic Cairill describe Parthol6n and Nemed as sons of Agnoman; according to the tract in L, they descend from Feinius Farsaid, and a poem added to Scal Tudin in Lebor na h Uidre lists Caicher (in p the Milesian Agnoman's nephew) among</page><page sequence="63">LEABHAR GABHALA 63 the clann Nemid.'71 Apparently, Nemed's pedigree was shifted when he became the ancestor of the non-Milesians, and further separated from its Milesian doublet by additions to both. The latter now provides ancestry for Occe and Ucce, who appear in all versions of LG (/116, b128, pXIII:34, bXIV:7) but with a pedigree only in p (ml14, LL115, F116). Though the Milesian Nemed does not survive in b, the appearance of Esrfi and Srui after Gaedel shows that a continuation of the line would perhaps have included him.172 These clues to the Milesian origins of Partholon and Nemed differ in kind from the typological parallelism that unites them with the other in- vaders, but may have inspired it. By the time Nennius summarized the invasions of Ireland, these three had achieved recognition as distinct events, but would have brought to the canon enough duplication to foster its growth as a cycle of narratives governed by common patterns and themes. In repeti- tion its authors would see convention. To the (Old-Testament) origins of the Gaedil and the genealogical foundations of their polity, the Fir Bolg contributed the mythos of Ireland's subject races - their enslavement, revolt, and final defeat -and the Tuatha D6 Danann her theomachy, all extant versions of which show the results of their fusion. That this scheme of successive invasions reached its canonical form (as in co) before the in- vasion-sagas reached theirs (as in c) accounts for the system of analogy that pervades them. The divine attributes (and Fomorian enemies) of Par- thol6n, Nemed, and the Milesians, the sinister associations of the Fir Bolg, and the biblical motifs attached to the Tuatha D6 Danann would not have emerged, say, from narratives based on the source for n13-15. The in- vasion-scheme in LG to a great extent moulded the traditions attached to each race. LG grew up in response to a medieval problem - the vast blank separ- ating Irish tradition from accepted world history - a problem it solved in a medieval way, allowing Christian universalism to multiply its patterns across an Irish stage. For the early Middle Ages, the Bible served as the primary source for ancient world history, the chronicles of Eusebius and Orosius as its principal compendia, harmonizations, and continuations, and Isidore's Etymologiae as a general encyclopaedia. These works inspired not only the historiographical context and framework for LG but to a remarkable extent the content itself, which adapts even pagan theology and contemporary politics to biblical myths of origin, migration, and population. Though much of this (with the notable exception of the Tuatha D6 Danann) remains 17'See Meyer's ed. in The Voyage of Bran, II, 288, verses 3-5. The eight children of Nemed comprise LG's tally of his sons and grandsons (see Fig. 2), with the addition of Caicher and omission of larbonel. Scemel recalls the Semel of LL242, the equivalent of Seme6n mac lar- boneoil. 172See Fig. 1, comparing the Toe, Limfind, and Glunfind of b with the Taitt, Limlind, and Eber Glufinnd of p. To get from Toe to Taitt, we must assume a progressive reinterpre- tation of genitive forms, turning a consonant-stem into an o-stem (Tat, g. s. Tait) and that into an indeclinable i-stem.

This relationship between the first and last lines of the poem furnishes the latter with a subject for its verbs - the aes ecna of Eochaid's (and my) audience as distinguished from the auctores they must heed - but the quatrain itself undercuts this distinction, supplying as antecedent nominative plural the auctair themselves. Eochaid thus calls for an audience that will become auctores, following the conventions both of a traditional literature, which sees authors as witnesses to a common heritage, and of scholarship, which calls students to the profession of teaching.

Scholars have tradi- tionally placed the composition of this work around 825. 84n10 A copy of this recension, recently discovered in Berlin, was ac- quired by the Royal Irish Academy in 1987, where it bears the shelf-mark 23.M.70. Rolf Baumgarten has examined this MS and believes it to be an autograph (see 'Kuno Meyer's Irish Manuscript', Newsletter of the School of Celtic Studies I (second printing, 1987), 23-5; 'An Irish Manuscript in Berlin', Celtic Cultures Newsletter no. 5 (1987), 9f.). 84n 12 John Carey edits Scel Tuacin meic Cairill and Immacallam Tuain fri Finnia together as a single text. 90:27ff The question-and-answer form of exposition is by no means unique to Ireland, and may indeed have a Latin source.

I would not now claim that the version of tract III in p was 'paraphrased from "E'riu ard, inis na rrig"'; the reverse is more likely. 94:35ff I would endorse this hypothesis more strongly now. The fre- quency with which medieval Irish scribes paraphrased their exemplars - even replacing lines of verse with metrically perfect equivalents - testifies to a view of scribal work incompletely differentiated from authorship (and the complement of its definition as transmission). It is not so very surprising that the oldest parts of LG should show the results of this verbal drift, as it were, and if p and a cannot be employed to reconstruct w as a text, they do testify to its existence. 95:19f. See previous note. 97n49 Eochaid ua Flannacain is also mentioned in Lebor na hUidre as the source of books used by Flann Mainistrech and Eochaid ua Cerin (see part II, note 97).
