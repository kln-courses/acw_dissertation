<plain_text><page sequence="1">Timelessness and Foreknowledge PAUL HELM There is a prima facie logical incompatibility between divine foreknowledge and human freedom. For if God knew yesterday that Jones will perform a particular action at some time in the future then God's knowledge is past. Being past it is unchangeable, and so necessary. If God knew yesterday what will happen, then it cannot now be the case, or at any time in the future be the case, that he did not know yesterday what will happen. Nothing can happen to make him not know. But if a proposition p is necessary, and p entails q, then q is necessary. (That is, [Np. N (p =D q)] =D Nq). The action in question, being foreknown by God, is necessary, and so not free. For if we were to suppose that Jones were free, he would have the power to change the past. God's foreknowledge of Jones's action 'secures' its performance. Anselm, Aquinas and others have disputed this conclusion about free will on the grounds that one of the premises of the argument, that God's knowledge is foreknowledge, is unacceptable. If God is timeless and knows all that is in one timeless gaze then it is improper to speak of his foreknowledge, and the argument fails. In reply to this it has been claimed that the notion of timeless- ness is incoherent, and other arguments have been deployed in an effort to reconcile divine foreknowledge and human freedom, notably by Anthony Kenny1 and Nelson Pike.2 These efforts appear to fail.3 In this paper I wish to do two things. In the first place, to offer a partial resuscitation of the notion of timelessness, and in particular of the idea of a timeless knower, and thus to rehabilitate this premise of Anselm's and Aquinas's argument. But, secondly, to argue that, nevertheless, even if the idea of a timeless knower is I 'Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom' in Aquinas: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed.

The attempt to defend the notion of timelessness will be made by considering some arguments against the idea of timeless know- ledge based upon the occurrence of temporal indexicals such as 'now', 'then' and 'over'. It will then be argued that it makes sense to speak of such a timeless knowerforeknowing events and actions. I In his well-known paper 'The Formalities of Omniscience'1 A. N. Prior argues against the view that in 'For every p, if p then God knows that p' the verb 'knows' is tenseless. His argument is not (as with some) that the notion of timelessness is incoherent but that if 'knows' is taken in a tenseless way 'the final effect is to restrict what God knows to those truths, if any, which are themselves timeless' (p. 29). Prior develops this in the form of two separate claims, which I wish to consider. In the first place he claims that if 'knows' is tenseless God could not know that some particular event was now over. 'For example, God could not, on the view I am considering, know that the I960 final examinations at Manchester are now over; for this isn't something that He or anyone could know timelessly, because it just isn't true timelessly', and 'so far as I can see all that can be said on this subject timelessly is that the finishing- date of the I960 final examinations is an earlier one than 29th August, and this is not the thing we know when we know that those examinations are over' (p. 2z9). But this does not appear to be all that might be said. Another thing that could be known timelessly is that the I960 final examinations at Manchester are over for Prior in I96I, but not over for Prior in I960. A timeless being could even know (at some cost to ordinary language, but quite perspicuously) that (say) the I5th June examination is now for Prior on the I 5th June, and was then (past) for Prior on the i6th June. It is certainly true that the reflexive 'now' is not equivalent to a particular date. As Prior says, when we are pleased that something Philosophy, April i962, reprinted in Papers on Time and Tense, Oxford, I968. Page references to this reprint.</page><page sequence="3">5I8 PAUL HELM: is now over we are not pleased that a particular timeless relation holds between two dates. But why does this fact count against the idea that it is possible for God timelessly to know this? What God knows (timelessly) in these circumstances includes the fact that we are pleased that a certain event is over, but not that he is pleased that it is over. Prior does not distinguish between sentences and propositions. The proposition that is expressed by Prior by 'The examination is now over' when uttered on a particular occasion can be expressed in various other ways. Otherwise we are driven to say, for example, that while Prior is looking forward to the I960 final examinations being over he never in fact achieves what he is looking forward to, since the form of words which Prior used ('I am looking forward to the examinations being over') cannot be used after the examina- tions to capture exactly what it is that Prior was looking forward to earlier. But if the expressing of the same proposition by various sentences is allowed, then there seems to be no reason why indexicals should not be replaced by dates and places. Any emotional attachment there may be to expressing a given pro- position in one way rather than another is surely irrelevant. What Prior was pleased about in August I960 is the fact that the final examinations were in June I960. Secondly, Prior claims that 'it seems an extraordinary way of affirming God's omniscience if a person, when asked what God knows now, must say "Nothing", and when asked what He knew yesterday, must again say "Nothing", and must yet again say "Nothing" when asked what God will know tomorrow' (p. 29). It must be said that these are odd questions to ask someone who believes that what God knows he knows timelessly. Yet, supposing he did not regard them as involving a petitio, need the reply be in quite the way Prior suggests? In the question, 'What does God know now?' the 'now' can be said to express an indexical reference to the questioner,1 and it does not follow from this fact that the verb in the question is tensed. It may or may not be. Thus the question 'What does God know now?', supposing God's know- ledge to be timeless, is equivalent to 'What does God timelessly know at the time this utterance is being made?'. The question is thus about what a temporal individual judges at a particular time that God knows timelessly. It is equivalent to 'What may God now be said by you to know (timelessly)?' For a believer in I A. N. Prior, 'Now', Nous (I968).</page><page sequence="4">TIMELESSNESS AND FOREKNOWLEDGE 5I9 timeless divine omniscience, the answer to this rather bizarre question is that God may be said now to know timelessly exactly what he may be said at any other time to know timelessly. Thus, to say that God may be said now to know timelessly that p is not to say that God, considered as a timeless knower, also exists sempiternally. Here I am arguing against Mrs. Kneale's claim that timeless objects are also sempiternal objects.1 Her grounds for this claim are that to say of an object that it is timeless is simply another way of saying that it is pointless to ask e.g. about its temporal origin. But though it is pointless to ask what the temporal origin of an object is it may nevertheless be true to say that it has a temporal origin. Mrs. Kneale is right in saying that an utterance can be a pointless thing to say and yet still be true. But it appears to be a mistake to claim that A is timeless is simply another way of claiming that it is pointless to ask such questions as 'When did A begin to exist?' For it is pointless to ask such questions of e.g. an indestructible substance, but indestructible substances are not timeless.2 In any case it seems absurd to say that timeless objects are also sempiternal in rather the same way that it seems absurd to say that because something such as a mental happening is spaceless it is present throughout space. Just as 'A is spaceless' is not logically equivalent to 'A is present throughout space' so 'A is timeless' is not logically equivalent to 'A is present at all times'. Mrs. Kneale's other claim is that necessity entails sempiternity in the sense that God's necessary existence entails his sempiternal existence. She uses the following argument (pp. 23I-232): (i) God is a necessary being (assumption) (2) Suppose that God is not sempiternal (3) If God is not sempiternal then there is a time when God does not exist. (4) If (3), then possibly God does not exist. (5) Thus God necessarily exists, and it is possible he does not exist (from (i) and (4)). (6) Hence necessity entails sempiternity. I 'Eternity and Sempiternity', P.A.S., I968-69. 2 Mrs. Kneale makes this point herself and suggests that it may provide a reductio of her notion of timelessness (op. cit. p. 23I).</page><page sequence="5">520 PAUL HELM: But why should we suppose that (3) follows from (2)? For (i) and (2) are compatible with (7) There is no time. If so, then (2) does not entail (3). And if (3) does not follow from (2) then (4) does not follow, and the reductio fails. It might be objected that (7), although possibly true, is certainly false. But it is not clear that one can appeal to logically contingent propositions, however certain, to rebut the argument. (I), (2) and (7) are logically consistent. Hence even if (7) is in fact false its possible truth shows that (3) does not follow from (2). And if (3) does not follow from (2) then the fact that God's not being sempiternal (supposing God to be a necessary being) does not entail a contradiction. Given that there is time, at any time 'X exists timelessly' (where X is a timeless object) will be true. But where there is no time, there is no entailment. So I want to say that there is a notion distinct from sempiternity, distinct in the sense that it does not entail it. We could call this notion timeless- ness. However, timelessness might be said to be related to sempi- ternity in a looser sense, as some comments in the previous para- graph might suggest. We could say that if S asserted 'O exists' and could not be wrong, then 0 could be timeless. But this does not entail that 0 is timeless, for 0 could simply have existed for all time, and be indestructible. Norman Kretzmann has argued that the idea of God's trans- cendence of time means that time is a universal human illusion.' But if for God nothing is over and done with, nor yet to happen, why does it follow that nothing can be over and done with, or going to happen, for any individual? This seems no more plausible than the claim that if God is not in spatial relations with anything nothing can be in spatial relations with anything. Yet it may be thought that if God does not know what is going on now it follows that God is missing something, that there is something that he could know which he fails to know, and is thus less than omniscient. To appreciate that this thought is illus- ory it is illuminating to draw a parallel with other reflexives such as 'here' and 'there', and with personal pronouns such as 'I'. Just as it is claimed by certain philosophers that God is outside time so I 'Omniscience and Immutability', Yournal of Philosophy, I966, reprinted in Philosophy of Religion, ed. Steven M. Cahn, I970. Page references to this reprint.</page><page sequence="6">TIMELESSNESS AND FOREKNOWLEDGE 52I it is claimed by some that God is outside space. It would appear, from this, that while God could know (i) Smith is at Cleopatra's Needle he cannot know (2) Smith is here (uttered by someone at Cleopatra's Needle). For, in order to know this, God must be at Cleopatra's Needle, but he cannot be, since he is non-spatial. He is neither at- Cleo- patra's Needle, nor is he anywhere else. If God, though he knows who is at Cleopatra's Needle, does not know that that person is here, does it follow that God lacks some item of knowledge? If so, and if God is omniscient, it follows that he must occupy all space. But what knowledge is God lacking? Does he not know that Smith is here? But God knows that Smith is at Cleopatra's Needle, and he knows that 'here' (in this case) is a reflexive for Cleopatra's Needle. Consider a further case, (3) I am at Cleopatra's Needle (uttered by Smith). On the Prior argument God can know (i) but he cannot know (4 For to know (3) he would have to be Smith. Suppose Smith is joined by Jones at the Needle, then both (3) and (4) I am Cleopatra's Needle (uttered by Jones) are true. To know this, God would have to be both Smith and Jones, two distinct individuals, while still remaining God. In support of his claim that 'An omniscient being surely must know all that Jones knows' Norman Kretzmann considers the two statements (S1) Jones knows that he is in a hospital (S2) Jones knows that Jones is in a hospital and points out (p. I03) that the two are logically distinct, in that Jones might know that he is in a hospital without knowing that he is Jones, because he is suffering from loss of memory. But by itself this is not a very powerful argument, for due to loss of memory Jones may know that 'It is raining' expresses a true proposition, but not that 'II pleut' does. We would not on that account press for 'It is raining' and 'II pleut' being two logically distinct propositions. Kretzmann argues that no-one but Jones</page><page sequence="7">-522 PAUL HELM: can know what (S1) describes Jones as knowing. Thus it is logically impossible for God to know this, since to know it he would have to be Jones. Thus, strictly, God does not know Jones under all possible descriptions, for he does not know what Jones knows as items of self-knowledge, since in order to know what Jones knows as items of self-knowledge he would have to be Jones. The definition of omniscience can be amended to cover this, however. An om- niscient being knows all that is true, and believes nothing that is false, in a manner that is consistent with existing as a distinct individual. This makes it necessarily true that an omniscient individual cannot have the self-knowledge of individuals distinct from him. Thus the Kretzmann argument does not establish that God is not omniscient. Rather it provides a reductio of the con- tention that an omniscient being, though knowing all true pro- positions, nevertheless cannot know all that Jones knows. God cannot know all that Jones knows under all possible descriptions without ceasing to be an individual distinct from Jones. But he does know all true propositions if he is omniscient. A parallel can be drawn with the notion of omnipotence, in which it is recognised that the fact that, for example, God cannot raise his arm does not imply that he is not omnipotent. Despite all this it may still be thought that a timeless being could not know what stage the world is at, and so is lacking a vital piece of knowledge. It is straightforward to ask what state the world is at for temporal individuals like ourselves and Napoleon. For us, for example, now is now, but for Napoleon, now is not now, but then (future). The time which we call 'now' is not now for everyone, for it is not now for Napoleon. The time we refer to reflexively as 'now' would have been referred to by Napoleon, had he chosen to, by a form of words such as'. . . years from now'. Now is now only for all who are contemporaries with ourselves. There are other possible times than the present, and for someone at any one of those possible times, that time is now for him. But to ask what stage the world is at for a tenseless individual is absurd, for it is only possible for such an individual to know what is going on in the world now for A, where A is some temporal individual. Prior says that to think of omniscience in tenseless terms is extraordinary. But how is it possible to think of omniscience in tensed terms? He suggests the following translation:</page><page sequence="8">TIMELESSNESS AND FOREKNOWLEDGE 523 It is, always has been, and always will be the case that for all p, if p then God knows that p. (p. 29). Here the variable 'p' may range over past, present and future tensed statements, as well as tenseless ones (p. 30). According to this translation God comes to know certain things. For example, he comes to know that the I960 final examinations are over. That is, on this understanding of omniscience it is not that God knows (timelessly) that in August I960 the I960 final examinations are over for Prior, but that sometime in I960 God comes to know (present tense) that the examinations are over, for Prior and for God. There are matters that God will know tomorrow that he does not know today, because they are not true today. So God comes to know more, as time goes on. It is true that of certain matters Prior wants to say that before they happen or are 'now unpreventable' they are unknowable and therefore even unknow- able to an omniscient deity. According to Prior, this applies to free human actions. But the point about God coming to know things today which he did not know yesterday holds even in a causally deterministic universe. For although in such a universe God knows that A must (causally) happen, where A is some event entailed by the relevant laws of nature, he is still lacking in the knowledge that A is over, until it is over. Can this be regarded as a case of genuine ignorance? Suppose that Jones, standing at Cleopatra's Needle, comes to know that Smith is there as well. If, later, when in Trafalgar Square, he is to retain the knowledge he had previously of Smith's whereabouts the reflexive 'here' (as it occurred in Jones's utterance 'Smith is here too') must be changed into a name or description, and a date must be added. 'Smith is here too' becomes 'Smith was at Cleopatra's Needle on Tuesday, too'. Jones is not ignorant of anything he knew before, but he would be ignorant if the expedient of transforming reflexives was not open to him. In the case of a sempiternal God's foreknowledge this process of transformation has another stage to it. What God foreknows by description, the use of dates and so forth he comes to know by (certain) indexicals and then comes to know by a fresh set of descriptions. On Prior's view God will, in this situation, have learned fresh sets of facts and, by the same token, there are matters which God knows today that he will be ignorant of tomorrow. Yet God comes to know no new truths, nor does he forget anything. He could not be surprised by anything he 'learns'</page><page sequence="9">-524 PAUL HELM: as his sempiternal life proceeds. His view will not be modified or developed. He knows all he could at a time, yet comes to know more and more, and less and less as time proceeds. But if he is genuinely learning and unlearning he cannot be omniscient, for to learn and un-learn implies ignorance at some point. If he is not genuinely learning and unlearning then Prior's argument about the significance of indexicals for omniscience is not sustained. Finally, Anthony Kenny argues ad hominem against Aquinas that his view of timelessness is inconsistent with the idea of predictive prophecy, which Aquinas also believed in.' But on the view being defended here 'At the time when the Epistle to the Romans was written God already knew that the Jews would finally be converted' entails 'At a time prior to the writing of the Epistle to the Romans any statement of the form "God timelessly knows when the Jews will be converted" would be true', and this is not inconsistent. Thus to speak of God's timeless knowledge at a particular time is not necessarily to be inconsistent, for one could be speaking of what a temporal agent may, at a particular time, truly say that God timelessly knows. II Given that the idea of a timeless knower makes some sense what could be meant by saying that such a knower foreknows a par- ticular action or event? What I wish to claim is that in these circumstances the concept of foreknowledge applies not to a timeless knower's knowledge of certain events or actions, but to a temporal agent's recognition of timeless knowledge. What is it that the timeless foreknowledge is before? It cannot be before anything for the timeless knower, for for him there is no temporal before or after, since he occupies no position in time. Thus for a timeless foreknower the statement (5) I foreknow that A where A is some event or action in a temporal 'stream' is necessarily false, since for it to be true A would have to stand in some temporal relation to the foreknower, which is imposible if the foreknower is timeless. However, though (5) is necessarily false, it does not follow that (6) He foreknows that A i. Kenny op. cit. pp 263-4</page><page sequence="10">TIMELESSNESS AND FOREKNOWLEDGE 525 is necessarily false, where 'He' refers to the timeless knower, and where (6) is uttered by a temporal individual. In the same way, though temporal individuals can say that God, if he exists, has existed a day longer today than yesterday, God could not say this. I want to claim that this is a parallel to the fact that while the utterance 'I am not talking now' is necessarily false, 'He is not talking now' can be true, even though 'I' and 'He' refer to the same person. For just as for 'I am not talking now' to be true the speaker would not have to be uttering anything and a fortiori not uttering the words 'I am not talking now' so for 'I foreknow that A' to be true the speaker would have to be in time, which if he were he could not be timeless. (Nothing, of course, hangs on the utterance of 'I foreknow that A' and it may be thought artificial to suppose that a timeless knower could utter anything. If so, we can substitute 'truly represent to himself that' for 'utter' or 'state'). But if (6) is not necessarily false, what does it mean, and under what conditions would it be true? (6) might be paraphased as: (i) At a time before this time (the time of (i)'s utterance) the statement 'T timelessly knows A' (where T refers to the timeless knower, and A is an event future to the time of the statement's utterance) is true. Or, more neatly, (ii) Before t (where t is the present) the statement that T knows (timelessly) that A was true. Where T is a truly timeless knower, it will follow that (i) and (ii) refer not simply to a particular time before the statement's utterance, but to any time prior to that time. What (i) and (ii) imply is that if anyone had asked yesterday, or at any time prior to the present, whether T timelessly knew A the answer would have been 'Yes'. But what would the point be of asking whether T timelessly knew A? If T is a timeless knower would it not be obvious that he timelessly knew A yesterday? What do (i) or (ii) say that the unvarnished 'T timelessly knows A' does not? One thing that comes to mind is that what 'T foreknows A' implies that 'T timelessly knows A' does not is that A is an event. For suppose that A is the proposition 'Red is a colour' then it would be absurd to say that T foreknows that red is a colour, just as it would be absurd to say of a temporal individual that that individual foreknows that red is a colour. Knows before what?</page><page sequence="11">526 PAUL HELM: There can only be foreknowledge of things that happen. So whereas in 'T timelessly knows A' A could be an event in 'T fore- knows A' A must be an event. (i) and (ii) indicate this in a way in which 'T timelessly knows A' cannot. A further way of making this point is to say that for T to know the future timelessly is for T to know an event future to some individual in time, and for T to know all about the future is for T to know all events future to some individual in time. None of this implies the propriety of saying that all events are present to such an omniscient, timeless knower. This way of talking is perfectly in order if all that is meant by it is that the knower knows all events, and knows them without having come to know them. But it generates unnecessary difficulties (perhaps encouraged by hill-top analogies) to say that all events are present to a timeless knower. He knows them not presently, but timelessly. In a similar way, it will not do to claim that for a timeless knower every event is simultaneous with every other event. For simultaneity is a temporal relation, or can be. Why should the advocate of timelessness be drawn here, and say anything?' Other- wise he appears to be committed to the view that there are two orders of time, the ordinary unfolding of events for temporal agents and knowers, and one moment of super-time into which every event is compressed, for the tenseless knower. Instead of such gibberish why not say that the timeless knower knows timelessly, and leave it at that? III I suggest therefore that it makes sense to speak of a timeless knower's foreknowledge of events where the notion of fore- knowledge expresses a temporal knower's belief or recognition that certain events were known timelessly before this time. But to say this is not to claim that the timeless knower's knowledge is analogical or anthropomorphic. It is literally knowledge, and it is literally foreknowledge. But it is false that it is foreknowledge for the timeless knower. On this point, see Mrs. Kneale, op. cit. p. 227. Anselm points out that 'Even though nothing exists within eternity except the present, nevertheless this is not a temporal present as we know it but an eternal present in which the whole of time is contained', On the Harmony of the Foreknowledge, the Predestination, and the Grace of God with Free Choice, in Trinity, Incarnation and Redemption, edited and translated by Jasper Hopkins and Herbert W. Richardson, I970, p. I62.</page><page sequence="12">TIMELESSNESS AND FOREKNOWLEDGE 527 If it is proper to speak of God's knowledge in this timeless way, then from the point in time of the temporal agent God knows beforehand. If he knows beforehand then it was true yesterday that God knows p. But this knowledge is past, and hence un- changeable, and so necessary. What it entails, the action that is foreknown, is likewise necessary. Hence there cannot be free will, even if God's knowledge of human actions is timeless.'
