<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Archaeology of Oceania: Australia and the Pacific Islands Edited by Ian Lilley. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford 2006. Pp. xx + 396. ISBN 0-6312-3082-3 (GBP60 Hbk); 0-6312-3083-1 (GBP22.99 Pbk) This is the latest volume in the series Blackwell Studies in Global Archaeology, under the editorial direction of Rosemary Joyce and Lynn Meskell, with the stated aim of providing 'contemporary texts' by 'top scholars' that treat key regional or thematic areas; the principal audience is intended to be undergraduates. Editor Ian Lilley commissioned 17 new articles, mostly by 'early to mid- career researchers', designed to relay 'new discoveries, conceptual innovations, and the dynamics of postcolonial realpolitik' (Lilley, p. 1). Established senior scholars active in Australia and the Pacific Islands are largely absent from this collection, which foregrounds the work of a new and emerging generation of archaeologists. These include indigenous scholars from New Caledonia, Tahiti, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, who contribute their perspectives on contemporary political issues. Lilley stresses the inclusion of both Australia and the islands of the Pacific within the geographic concept of 'Oceania' (p. 2), arguing that one must include both the continent and the islands rather than 'promote their separation'. This may be true, but the book gives only lip service to the intellectual integration of archaeological research in Australia and the islands. Indeed, Archaeology of Oceania is subdivided into two main and quite discrete parts, dealing successively and separately with Australia and 'the Pacific'; a shorter third part addresses contemporary issues of politics. Authors in each of the two main geographic sections barely cross-reference relevant articles in the other section. While there would have been plenty of scope for comparative perspectives on the role of ethno- archaeology, on the interpretation of rock art, on issues of 'short' and 'long' chronologies between Australia and the islands, or a number of other themes, the reader will search in vain for geographically integrated analysis. Similarly, chapters dealing with deep time perspectives in Melanesia are segregated with 'the Pacific', whereas they might more effectively have been put together with the Australian contributions dealing with Pleistocene settlement. Thus, despite appearing between two covers, the organization of this volume continues to promote this geographic separation rather than to break it down. Despite this caveat, there is much important and exciting new research presented in these pages. Following Lilley's introduction, Part I's five chapters offer a sampling of recent work in Australia, with emphasis on dating and chronology, lithic technology, and symbolic systems (especially as these may be interpreted through the medium of 'rock art'). O'Connor and Veth (more senior scholars than most contributors to this volume) tackle the issues of dating and chronology of Australian colonization and settlement, with a regional review. They describe considerable regional variability, and suggest that future work should focus on obtaining local paleoclimatic records to help understand the complex patterning of landscape and site formation processes. David integrates indigenous Australian concepts of the 'dreaming' with landscape-level archaeological data from several regions to construct an 'archaeology of the dreaming'. One wishes that his views on the role of ethnoarchaeology were more closely compared and contrasted with those of Conte in a later chapter on Polynesia. Hiscock's chapter is the only one to deal in depth with the material record that dominates so much of Australian archaeology - stone tools - and is focused exclu- sively on the Holocene. His is an insightful contribution to lithic technology, showing for example how variation in scraper shapes reflects not the kind of tasks to which they were applied, but rather the intensity with which a scraper was 'transported, used, maintained, and recycled' (p. 74). The final two chapters on Australia both deal with rock art. Macdonald and Veth contrast Holocene 'graphic systems' in arid and fertile environments, seeking to understand how such art functioned within social systems to signal key information. Clarke and Frederick provide a case study of the Groóte Eylandt archipelago marked by seasonal cross- cultural interaction between indigenous inhabitants and Indonesian traders. Not surprisingly in this context, boat images are a dominant feature of the rock art, which the authors interpret as demonstrating 'acts of observation, enquiry, and also an intentionality to grapple with difference' (p. 130). Chapters 7 through 15 deal with the 'the Pacific', that is to say the island world from New Guinea eastwards to Polynesia and Micronesia. Geographic representation is uneven, however, with the first four chapters dealing with the large Near Oceanic islands of New Guinea, the Bismarcks, and the Solomons, and the remaining five covering all of Remote Oceania. Micronesia gets especially poor coverage, with just a single short chapter. Polynesia, arguably the most thoroughly investigated region within the Pacific world, is treated in three chapters, all rather topically specialized (ethnoarchaeology, territorial units in Hawaii, and Marquesan rock art). One is struck by notable gaps of omission: nothing on Western Polynesia, where Polynesian culture first differentiated itself from its Lapita ancestor; not a mention of vast New Zealand; and, nothing on the intense debate regarding the timing and nature of Polynesian expansion into the far eastern Pacific, or on the exciting recent work on inter-island voyaging and exchange. Such major gaps in coverage will lessen the value of this book to the intended audience of undergraduate students, who more than professionals require balanced coverage of topics and regions. In spite of such imbalances, there is much of value in the chapters on the Pacific islands. Walter and Sheppard offer a perspective on Melanesian archaeology framed around a case study of the Roviana Lagoon in the Western Solomons. They argue that there has been too little emphasis in 128</page><page sequence="2">Melanesia on the archaeology of social change, and in their Roviana study attempt to integrate ethnoarchaeology and oral traditions to outline a sequence of 'religious intensification' over the past 700 years. Tim Denham, in one of the most compelling contributions to this volume, reviews the large-scale problem of Envisaging early agri- culture' in New Guinea, both with respect to major conceptual issues (such as how 'domestication' and 'agriculture' may be defined and identified in the archaeological record) and to the details of the archaeological record at Kuk and other Highlands sites. This thoughtful chapter deserves to be read by all archaeologists who work on problems of early agricultural origins anywhere in the world. The back-to-back chapters by Leavesley and Pavlides may be read as a pair, as both deal with issues of late Pleistocene to early Holocene cultural sequences on the larger islands of the Bismarck Archipelago (New Ireland and New Britain). Leavesley looks at 'pulses of deposition' in the archaeological record, and attempts to account for these in terms of several possible inputs, including economic complexity, environmental manipula- tion, and changing technology. Pavlides, who has carried out important research in Yombon, New Britain, is more focused on changes revealed through fine-grained technological analysis of lithic assemblages. Her conclusion that 'changes between early and mid-Holocene approaches to stone artifact production indicate a shift in the factors structuring technology in the rain forest' (p. 219) is credible on the data presented. More contentious is her claim that 'Lapita merely represents one late Holocene expression of the adjustments in resource use, settlement mobility, land- use, and trade that have characterized [Near Oceania] since it was first settled' (p. 222, emphasis added). Given the statement by Walter and Sheppard (p. 141) that 'Lapita has become a fundamental organizing principle around which we build our understanding of Melanesian prehistory', and the emphasis given to Lapita by other contributors such as Pavlides, Galipaud's all too brief treatment of 'an alternative perspective' on Lapita in Chapter 11 comes as a disappointment. He fails to reference several important recent Lapita excavations and analyses, and focuses almost exclusively on issues of ceramic classification, especially regarding plainwares. Galipaud's treatment of 'horizon' and 'tradition' may reflect differences in Anglophone and Francophone perspective, but he seems not to be aware that several scholars since Jack Golson have pointed out that Lapita is best understood as a 'ceramic series' incorporating aspects of both horizon and tradition. That a more comprehensive treatment of Lapita - including such aspects as settlement pattern, subsistence, details of stylistic analysis of the anthropomorphic designs - was not included in this volume is a real disappointment. There has been so much innovative new work on Lapita in recent decades that more of it should have been represented in this book, especially if it is to serve as an introduction for students. The three chapters dealing with Polynesia all present interesting new work, albeit rather tightly focused. Conte reviews the role of ethnoarchaeology, arguing for an approach that is not unlike that of the well-known 'direct historical approach' in North American prehistory. Ladefoged and Graves present the results of their on-going research into the problem of political territory formation in the Hawaiian Islands, based primarily on detailed spatial analysis of the Kohala region of Hawai' i Island. Their results are highly relevant to questions of sociopolitical change and intensification in Polynesian chiefdoms. Finally, Millerstrom gives a case study of 'rock art' (petroglyphs and sculpture) in its settlement pattern context in the Marquesas Islands, emphasizing that images cannot be understood devoid of their larger settlement and landscape contexts. Rainbird offers the only contribution dealing with Micronesian societies, a reconsideration of the well-known monumental sites of Nan Madol on Pohnpei and Lelu on Kosrae, and what these may reveal of social structures in these two high-island societies. Rainbird begins with the rejection of a somewhat caricatured processual archaeology in which "all change in society must be a response to external pressure" (did any processualists ever really take such an extreme view?). Drawing then primarily on the data obtained by processualists such as Ayres, Athens, and Cordy, Rainbird promulgates an interpretation of these megalithic structures in terms of 'acting as mnemonics in the recounting of genealogies' (p. 313). If I read him correctly, Rainbird implies that there was no significant social change over the course of Pohnpeian or Koraean histories: all was complex from the start, and Nan Madol and Lelu simply represent 'places where power was negotiated through genealogy and competition' (p. 314). I for one am not convinced that the replacement of the processualists' 'evolution' with the post-processualists' 'negotiation' gets us very far in historical understanding, but it will be for other readers to judge the strength of such theoretical concepts. The final section of Archaeology of Oceania is called simply, 'Polities', and it provides a platform for several indigenous archaeologists to speak frankly about the neocolonial world of Pacific archaeology, and how indigenous perspectives have already and may further affect archaeological practice. Sand (a local 'Caldoche' of European descent), Bole, and Ouetcho write about New Caledonia, where the archaeological record of discrete societies (and their differentiation over three millennia) can readily be at odds with a contemporary political movement that seeks to create a 'unified 'Kanak people" (p. 337). Smith (an expatriate) describes issues of 'heritage management' arising in the context of Fiji's first colonial capital, Levuka. And in a concluding multi-authored chapter titled 'Last Words', a French Polynesian (Cauchois), indigenous Australian (Dugay-Grist), and New Guiñean (Mandui) all recount personal perspectives on what it is like to be a practicing archaeologist in the modern Pacific. I particularly liked Cauchois' question: 'Since our ancestors seem to have practiced long-distance inter-island voyages, why should we not do the same thing with our ideas that need to be shared?' Why not indeed? 129</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology of Oceania is a rich collection of essays, some stronger or more innovative than others, but all together offering an intellectual feast from the ranks of mid- career and younger scholars of Australia and the Pacific. It demonstrates without question that the field is alive and exciting. Whether the book coheres as well as it might as an integrated overview for undergraduate students, as the series editors claim, is another question. My own view is that it will provide an important sampling of contemporary perspectives, but would be hard pressed to stand alone as a single textbook for an introductory course; the gaps in coverage are too many. But this is a critique perhaps overly focused on sins of omission rather than commission. It is an important contribution, and editor Ian Lilley deserves credit for having pulled it all together.
