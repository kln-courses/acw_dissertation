<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEER, Vol. 88, Nos. 1/2, January/April 2010 PART TWO Bronze Tsars: Ivan the Terrible and Fedor Ivanovich in the D?cor of Early Modern Guns SERGEI BOGATYREV Visual material was one of Lindsey Hughes's favourite subjects. Lindsey often used portraits, paintings and buildings as historical sources in her studies. An inspiring teacher, she also generously shared the results of her research with her students. In a course on Russian history, which I was fortunate to teach together with Lindsey at SSEES, she asked the students to compare two portraits of Russian royalty, those of Aleksei Mikhailovich (1672) and his son Peter the Great (1717). In one such class Lindsey told me that she was working on an article about those portraits. Published posthumously in 2008, her article deals with them as manifestations of the Russian 'monarchical myth'. In the article, Lindsey examines the symbolism and historical contexts of the portraits. She concludes that they serve the same purpose, to represent the power and dignity of the Russian rulers. At the same time, they reflect profound cultural changes in the conception of Russian rulership that occurred during the reign of Peter the Great.1 This paper is based on Lindsey Hughes's method of comparative analysis of royal portraiture. What follows is an interpretation of two images of Muscovite royalty on early modern guns. One of them can be found on a gun produced by the German master Karsten Middeldorp in 1559. As will be shown below, that image represents Ivan the Terrible. Another image, which depicts Tsar Fedor Ivanovich, is on the Tsar Cannon, which was cast by the renowned Russian gun founder Andrei Chokhov in 1586. Sergei Bogatyrev is a Senior Lecturer in Early Russian History at UGL SSEES. This work would not have been possible without the help of Dorena Caroli, A. I. Filiushkin and I. A. Komarov who have provided me with copies of rare publications. I am also grateful to Ann Kleimola and Charles Halperin for their comments and suggestions.

Previously guns were manufac tured from wrought iron. Cast bronze guns involved smaller labour costs; they offered better military characteristics at less weight, though the cost of their material, bronze, was higher.2 The new technology was brought to Muscovy by Italian masters in the late fifteenth century. The impact of foreign specialists on Muscovite artillery is usually studied in terms of Muscovy's technological backwardness and the pace of Muscovy's catching up with the West. However, historians of knowledge transfer challenge the view that knowledge and expertise were spread across the world through a simple process of diffusion. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there was a common interna tional pool of gun makers working in Spain, France, England, Venice, the Ottoman Empire and Muscovy.3 This is why in recent studies of technology exchange in the early modern world, Western triumphalism and local nationalism give way to a more complex picture of diverse contacts and mutual relations.4 Thus, Yves Cohen, who studies Russian and Soviet technology, notes that Russia was not just an importer of Western technology. Thanks to a variety of institutional, human and material agents, imported knowledge was profoundly trans formed in Russia. The Russian locale itself also changed as a result of knowledge transfer.5 Casting in bronze gave guns a new cultural dimension because the technology permitted decorations to be added to the gun barrel. Bronze guns thereby functioned not only as weapons, but also as means of political propaganda. In this paper I will study the images of tsars on the above-mentioned guns in a historical and cultural context. A word of caution about attribution is in order. The images under discussion are attributed in this work to the masters of corresponding guns, Karsten Middeldorp and Andrei Chokhov. These attributions are to an extent conventional because in the sixteenth century gun founders often employed professional sculptors and artists to execute decorations 2 See Thomas Esper, 'Military Self-Sufficiency and Weapons Technology in Muscovite Russia', Slavic Review, 28, 1969, 2, pp. 185-208 (p. 188).

Whether Middeldorp and Chokhov worked on their images alone or in collaboration with somebody else, their barrels are important but often overlooked sources on the representation and perception of the Muscovite monarchy. I In the sixteenth century, both in the West and in Muscovy, gun d?cor often included various animalistic, floral and anthropomorphic motifs. The latter were especially typical of German masters, who decorated their guns with images of rulers.6 In line with this tradition, the German master Karsten Middeldorp cast a gun called the 'Lion5 (also known as the 'Lion of Reval5, 2,375 kg) in 1559. The barrel was commissioned by the city council of Reval (Tallinn). In 1800, together with other cannon, Middeldorp's gun was removed from Reval to St Petersburg where it is now kept in the Artillery Museum.7 The iconographie programme of the barrel was defined by the commissioner, as becomes apparent from the inscription on the gun: A Council of Reval had named me the 'Lion', to tear apart his enemies should they not wish to live in peace. Karsten Middeldorp cast me in the year 1559, that is true.8 The d?cor of the cannon develops the themes outlined in the inscrip tion. Thus, we can see the great and small coats of arms of Reval and a lion on the barrel. There is also a sculptural image of a human head at the rear of the barrel (Fig. 1). The depicted person can be identified with the help of the reference to an enemy in the inscription and the production date, 1559. The enemy of Reval was then Ivan the Terrible. After the beginning of the Livonian war Ivan's troops reached the suburbs of Reval in September 1558, but they failed to take the city. Muscovy and Livonia concluded a truce in early 1559. Both parties used this pause to build up their military strength before military operations resumed in the autumn of 1559.9 6 Heinrich M?ller, Deutsche Bronzegesch?tzrohre, 1400-1750, Berlin, 1968, p. 149. 7 The Military-Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineer and Signal Corps, no. 09/27. 8 DEN L?WEN EIN RADT LET // NOMEN MICH VAN REVEL DAT // TO SPALDE ICH ERE FIENDE // SOL DE DAR NICHT WOLLEN // DAT SE IM FREDE LEVEN SOL//LEN ANNO 1559 LAR GOET // MI KARSTEN MIDDEL// DORP DAT IS WAR.

Author's photo</page><page sequence="5">52 BRONZE TSARS Commissioning the gun from Middeldorp was thus part of strength ening the defence of Reval in anticipation of new Muscovite attacks. The city also ordered a number of guns from the renowned local master Kort (Cordt, Cort, Korth) Hartmann (active 1544-70), including the 'Red Lion5 (1559) and the 'Bitter Death5 (1560), now also in the Artillery museum in St Petersburg.10 The guns commissioned by the city are decorated with politically charged symbols. Reval obviously wished to represent two sides of the unfolding conflict in the d?cor of their cannon. The 'Bitter Death5 features a figure of a city councillor (Ratmann) holding the coat of arms of Reval in his hand. The Ratmann on Hartmann5s gun symbolizes the elective municipal authority of Reval, whereas the head on Middeldorp5s barrel represents the auto cratic power of the city's enemy, the tsar of Muscovy. This is why the image on Middeldorp5s gun features several symbols of Muscovite royalty (on which, see below). A convergence of evidence, including the inscription on the barrel, the historical context of its production and the symbolism of Middeldorp5s sculptural portrait indicates that the master depicted Ivan the Terrible.11 Karsten Middeldorp was from L?beck, as evidenced by an inscrip tion on a bell cast by the master for a church in Denmark. Three bells manufactured by Middeldorp between 1548 and 1554 have survived in Denmark.12 John Lind has noticed that these bells can be found in churches scattered across the country. Lind has thus suggested that Middeldorp received orders from different clients, including the citizens of Reval, while working from L?beck.13 The fact that Middel dorp^ name does not appear in the city registry of Reval seems to corroborate Lind5s suggestion that the master worked from L?beck.14 10 L. Anting, Tallinskie oruzhdniki i ognestrel'noe oruzhie XIV-XVI vekov, Tallinn, 1967, pp. 37-39. Kort Hartmann and his son Hinrich also took orders for bells. Two of their bells, which were commissioned for churches in Finland, can be seen now in the National Museum in Helsinki: Kort's bell of 1554 and Hinrich's one of 1572. The former is misdated in the museum tag to c. 1590. One of Hinrich's bells (1586) is still hanging on the City Hall of Tallinn. 11 Recently several scholars have independently identified Middeldorp's image as a portrait of Ivan IV. V. M. Krylov et al.

The master demonstrates perfect command of three-dimensional space. At the same time, human figures on items produced by local masters from Reval often look flat, conventional and somewhat archaic for the middle of the sixteenth century.15 A further study in the archives of L?beck will probably yield more information about the master and the place of his work. Middeldorp's barrel is an important example of cultural traffic in the Baltic region. L?beck traditionally had close cultural contacts with Denmark, the Netherlands, as well as the German and Italian lands. However, in the sixteenth century the L?beck economy stagnated.16 The shrinking of local markets may explain why Middeldorp actively sought commissions from abroad, including Reval, in the late 1540s and 1550S. Middeldorp's image is one of the earliest examples, if not the earliest, of revived interest in the figure of Ivan the Terrible in north-western Europe during the Livonian war. By the middle of the sixteenth century the Western tradition of depicting the ruler of Muscovy was still rather limited. The interest of Western artists in Muscovite royalty was stimulated by Sigismund Herberstein's missions to Russia in 1517 and 1526. Erhard Schoen of Nuremberg seems to be the first Western artist to create images of Muscovite royalty in the late 1520s. Schoen produced two woodcuts representing Vasilii III in profile, one half length and another equestrian full-length (Fig. 2).17 In both woodcuts, Vasilii's head, including his face and headgear, is executed almost iden tically. Schoen's prints are typical Renaissance representations of an 'exotic' ruler and hardly contain any reliable historical information. His Vasilii wears a combination of a fur-brimmed hat and a Western type circlet with triangular rays all round (similar to the German ^ackenkrone and the English heraldic 'antique crown'). Similar fanciful crowns also appear in many images of Muslim rulers in Sebastian M?nster's Cosmographia. 15 Compare images of noble men and women on Kort Hartmann's gun 'Bitter Death', Hinrich Hartmann's bell from Helsinki and in a fresco from the Castle of Turku (c. 1530) reproduced in Mariti Puhakka (ed.), Turun Unna, Vammala, 1999, p. 29. 6 Alexander Cowan, 'Cultural Traffic in L?beck and Danzig in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries', Scandinavian Journal of History, 28, 2003, 3-4, pp. 175-85 (p. 180). 17 Max Geisberg, The German Singk^qf Woodcut: ijoo-1550, revised and edited by Walter L.

Circlets with triangular rays can be seen in some portraits of Roman emperors, for example, on the coins of Claudius II Gothicus (268-70 ad) and Aurelian (270-75 ad). At the same time, there is no reason to believe that the headgear of the Muscovite ruler was deliberately reminiscent of a Western crown. It is true that Ivan IV wears a crown with rays in many miniatures in the Illustrated Chronicle Compilation (Litsevoi letopisnyi svod, i57os-early 1580s). However, these miniatures are not reliable because they had been heavily influenced by Western prints.18 Some scholars of Muscovite regalia tend to accept Schoen's images uncritically and even use them for reconstructing the crown of Muscovite rulers.19 Schoen's image is obviously a misinterpretation of the design of the Cap of Monomakh, which combines elaborate metalwork and fur brim. Such combinations of metal and fur in headgear was unusual for Westerners and made them think that the Muscovite ruler was wearing a fur hat and a metal crown on his head. In 1547 another artist, Augustin Hirschvogel, who worked, among other places, in Nuremberg and Vienna, prepared an engraved portrait of Vasilii III (Fig. 3). Part of his series of prints depicting various rulers, Hirschvogel's image was intended as an illustration for verses glorifying Herberstein.20 Unlike Schoen, Hirschvogel did give his Vasilii some features which can be considered Muscovite, like a cone-shape cap with fur brim (no fanciful rays), a long garment with a fur neckpiece, and boots with curved toe-caps without heels. Hirschvogel's Vasilii is sitting on a throne; a heraldic shield leaning against the throne bears an image of a horseman beating a dragon. This is obviously an attempt to reproduce the famous Muscovite symbol (on its meaning, see below). Hirschvogel's rendering of the symbol suggests that his image was influenced by Herberstein, who describes in his travel account a Muscovite seal with a naked horseman (homo nudus). In accordance with Herberstein, the master also depicted the Muscovite horseman naked.21 Western artists, however, did not always closely follow Herberstein. Thus, despite his account of Vasilii III shaving his beard in order to please his young wife, both Schoen and Hirschvogel consistently pictured Vasilii III bearded. 18 lu. A.

Their vision of Muscovite royalty was based on a mixture of exoticism and elements of Western court culture, like a crown with rays and a heraldic pattern. Typical facial features of Western 'portraits' of the Muscovite ruler included a beard and a prominent nose. Schoen's and Hirschvogel's prints were very influen tial, although for different reasons. Hirschvogel's image became well known due to the close connections between the artist and Herberstein (both of them also worked with the same printer in Vienna). Hirsch vogel's 'portrait' was reproduced in numerous editions of Herberstein's account of Muscovy from 1549. Schoen's woodcut gained popularity for political reasons. Ivan IV's military victories at the beginning of the Livonian war generated numerous Flugschriften and prints devoted to the fearsome ruler of Muscovy.22 Some of them capitalized on Schoen's prints. The best known example of this trend is the portrait of Ivan IV printed by Hans Weygel in Nuremberg 1563, which is in fact a straightforward and flat reproduction of Schoen's image (Fig. 2).23 Like Weygel, Middeldorp relied on Schoen's prints, but in a very specific way. Middeldorp obviously borrowed the chequered pattern of the collar and the handlebar moustache of the Muscovite ruler from Schoen's 'portrait' of Vasilii III. Where Middeldorp differs from Shoen is the striking historical accuracy of the ceremonial hat. . E. Brandenburg misinterpreted the hat in Middedorp's image as an Eastern turban.24 In fact this is a very early and in many respects unique representation of the Cap of Monomakh. The Cap of Monomakh was a major instrument of legitimization of the power of Muscovite rulers. According to the legend, it was a gift from a Byzantine emperor to Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev (r. 1113-25), but the actual date and place of its production remain unclear. It is usually dated to the fourteenth century, but it is possible that it was compiled under Vasilii III (r. 1505-30) of different earlier components.25 It was precisely the reign of Vasilii III when the cap became a symbol of continuity of power from Constantinople to Kiev and to Moscow. The cap was demonstrated to Herberstein who left us the earliest description of it. He does not say whether he saw the hat during his 22 Andreas Kappeler, Ivan Groznyj im Spiegel der ausl?ndischen Druchchrifien seiner ?eit.

In 1547, the Cap of Mono makh became a central element in the ritual of Ivan IV's coronation as tsar. The design of the cap changed over the course of time, and we know litde about how the Cap of Monomakh actually looked in the sixteenth century. Foreign descriptions of the cap, including that given by Herberstein, are very short.26 Visual material is not a great help either. The earliest known depiction of the cap can be found in the panels of the throne of Ivan the Terrible in the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin (1551), which illustrate the legend about obtaining the cap from Byzantium. However, these Muscovite renderings are very conventional.27 So, as we have seen, are sixteenth-century Western images of the Muscovite crown. In this context, Middeldorp's representation of the Cap of Mono makh becomes an important historical source because the master reproduced many details of the cap as exactly as the technology of casting allowed. We can see over half of the total surface of the hat in the image. The back part of the hat is at the place where the sculpture joins the back side of the barrel (the so-called cascable plate). The headgear has three parts: fur brim, semi-spherical middle part and a tip. This composition fully corresponds to that of the Cap of Monomakh which can be seen now in the Armoury of the Kremlin. Both caps have fur brims (Fig. 4, section 1). The middle part of the hat in Middeldorp's sculpture is divided by recesses into several segments. The master thereby rendered the structure of the Cap of Monomakh, which is composed of segmental plates covered with filigree (Fig. 4, section 2). The tip of the hat in Middeldorp's portrait has a round base, almond-shaped elements and a pommel on top of them. Similar com ponents can be detected in the Cap of Monomakh. The round base corresponds to the cup crowning the plates of the Cap of Monomakh (Fig. 4, section 3); the almond-shape parts obviously represent the precious stones and pearls on top of the hat from the Kremlin (Fig. 4, section 4); the pommel denotes the actual hat's holder for a cross (Fig. 4, section 5). We can only speculate where Middeldorp received such detailed information about the actual design of the Muscovite cap from. One possible source is his clients from Reval. He could also have learned 26 Gerbershtein, ?apiski, pp. 82-83; Lloyd E. Berry and Robert O.

Usually trained as engineers and designers, they were able to give a professional account of how the Cap of Monomakh looked. Finally, the possibility that Middeldorp visited Moscow himself cannot be ruled out either. Missing from Middeldorp's image is the cross which crowns the real Cap of Monomakh. The dating of the present cross is unclear. . V. Zhilina dates it to the thirteenth century, but I. A. Bobrovnitskaia seems to be closer to the truth when she writes that the cross should be dated to the seventeenth century.28 It is likely that in the sixteenth century the cross was not a permanent feature of the headgear. The images on Ivan IV's throne, which illustrate the legend about how the cap was obtained from Byzantium, present the cap both with and with out a cross. The cross appears in the scene of coronation, something which is quite natural given the religious character of the ceremony. In other situations, like the scene of transporting the cap in a ship, the cross is missing.29 Even in the Muscovite image of Tsar Fedor on the Tsar Cannon (on which more later), the ruler wears the Cap of Mono makh with no cross. On the basis of Middeldorp's 'portrait' we can safely conclude that in the middle of the sixteenth century the Cap of Monomakh gener ally had the same design as that which we can see today. At the same time, such components as the cross and the massive precious stones on the hat's plates are missing from Middeldorp's image; the design of the fur brim and the tip of the cap in his sculpture look slightly differ ent in comparison with the cap from the Kremlin (Fig. 4). It is hard to say whether these differences reflect artistic conventionality or the evolution of the actual cap's design. Apart from the headgear, the master made a reference to another element of Muscovite ceremonial dress. The complex collar around the head's neck is highly reminiscent of barmy, another item of Muscovite royal regalia which was allegedly received together with the cap from Byzantium. The head adorning Middeldorp's barrel thus represents Ivan the Terrible in full regalia. Unlike the ceremonial gear, the face of Middeldorp's image presents greater problems for historical analysis. It is of course tempting to see it as a realistic portrait of Ivan the Terrible. Some traits of the image, like hair divided in the middle, are highly individual and are not attested by any other images of the tsar. However, it is important to remember that we have no authentic portraits of Ivan the Terrible. 28Zhilina, Shapfa, p. 113; I. A.

Miniatures of the official chronicle represent Ivan through a set of conventional symbols typical of medieval art. Thus, the appear ance of a beard indicates changes in his age (young Ivan is depicted clean shaven). Changes in Ivan's status as a monarch are indicated through different designs of his headgear. A princely hat, similar to that depicted by Hirschvogel, corresponds to the tide of grand prince, while the above-mentioned Western-type crown with rays symbolizes the title of tsar which Ivan assumed in 1547. Various modes of communication between the tsar and his courtiers, like order or discussion, are repre sented with various gestures of the tsar's hands. However, his face always remains the same and in fact does not differ from thousands of other faces appearing in the numerous chronicle miniatures.30 The famous portrait of Ivan which is now kept in Copenhagen was obviously painted long after his death, probably in the seventeenth century, and still bears many features of conventional Muscovite icon painting.31 Even the anthropological reconstruction of Ivan's face carried out by M. M. Gerasimov is based on a method that is not entirely free from artistic imagination.32 Without reliable points of reference, it is hard to verify the accuracy of Middeldorp's rendering of Ivan's face. However, his 'portrait' is the only known contemporary sculptural image of the tsar. II In Muscovy, the first master to use royal imagery in gun d?cor was the famous gun maker Andrei Chokhov. He was active from 1567/68 to 1628/29, which means that he managed to survive the turmoil of 30 A. V.

Thanks to his expertise, Chokhov's service was requested by practically all Russian rulers from Ivan the Terrible to the False Dmitrii I to Mikhail Romanov. Like his Western colleagues, Chokhov cast both guns and bells. Two bells bear ing the name of the master have survived in the Moscow Kremlin: 'Glukhoi' (1620/21) and 'Reut' (1621/22). A number of other bells have been attributed to Chokhov on the basis of circumstantial evidence.33 Chokhov's main specialization, however, was gun making, as becomes apparent from the inscription on his 'Reut' bell which identi fies the master as 'gun founder' (pushechnoi litets). He began his career as an apprentice to the renowned German master at the tsar's service Kashpir (Caspar) Ganusov in the late 1560s. By 1575 Chokhov's apprenticeship was completed and he acted as an independent master. In 1589/90 he already had his own apprentices. In the 1590s Chokhov became the leading specialist of the Artillery Office (Pushechnyi prikaz) with the highest annual salary of 30 rubles (the administrative head of the Office received 20 rubles).34 Inscriptions on Chokhov's gun reflect his leading position in the profession by systematically referring to him as master Chokhov was much indebted to the German tradition of gun found ing. He picked up, among other things, the Western practice of deco rating gun barrels with floral motifs and political symbols. The earliest of his known guns, a piece of 1567/68 which he produced during his apprenticeship, already bore images of plants and the double-headed eagle.36 The double-headed eagle was used on the seals of the princes of Moscow long before Chokhov, only beginning to appear on gun barrels in the 1560s. Muscovites borrowed the practice of depicting heraldic emblems on guns from Poland and Lithuania, apparently 33 I. D. Kostina, 'Kolokola Andreia Chokhova', in S. A. Beliaev and I. A.

Nemirovskii identifies the ?Egup' with Chokhov's mortar of 1586/87 from the Artillery museum. This identification is questionable because, contrary to Nemirovskii, there are significant differences between inscriptions on two guns. The inscription on the 'Egup', as it is quoted in the survey, calls the gun pishaV.

An anthropomorphic image appeared on a Muscovite barrel cast by certain Ignatii as early as 1499/1500, but it was probably a mere decoration deprived of any political meaning.38 By contrast, human figures on Chokhov's guns symbolize power, dignity and military might. In 1586 he cast the mag nificent Tsar Cannon (Tsar'-pushka, 38,400 kg) which is decorated with a 'portrait' of Tsar Fedor Ivanovich (Figs 5, 6).39 Later Chokhov created images of classic personages, apparendy under the influence of the East Slavic adaptations of Guido de Columnis's History of the Destruction of Troy.40 Adaptations of Columnis's narrative provided a cultural model for sixteenth-century, monarchs.41 This may explain why the classic figures executed by Chokhov have attributes of royal power (crown, throne, staff, orb). There is still much uncertainty as to why Chokhov manufactured the massive Tsar Cannon. Most historians believe that it had a military purpose, though they disagree about what type of missile it could fire.42 If the Tsar Cannon was created as a weapon, by all standards it was hopelessly obsolete for the 1580s. In Europe the production of gigantic pieces was abandoned by the beginning of the sixteenth century.

A huge piece (16,380 kg) was cast by the Italian master Paolo (Pavlin) Dubosis in Moscow in 1488.44 In the middle of the 1550s, large guns were also manufactured by Chokhov's tutor Kashpir Ganusov (19,657 kg, 1554) and the master Stepan Petrov (16,708 kg, 1555). The production dates allow one to link the appearance of these guns with Ivan IV's triumph over Kazan' in 1552 and with the end of the dynastic crisis of 1553. By commissioning these super guns Ivan celebrated his military victory and the restoration of stability in his realm.

Ganusov's and Petrov's guns, however, were not just show pieces. Ivan the Terrible used them in his campaign against Polotsk in 1562-63.45 Why did the Muscovites revitalize the tradition of massive cannon in the mid-i58os? Why did the Tsar Gannon remain unfinished, making it unsuitable for firing?46 Technological backwardness is obviously irrelevant here because even such a critical observer as Giles Fletcher highly praised Russian artillery during the 1580s.47 Like any powerful weapon, gigantic guns performed not only mili tary but also political functions.48 Under Fedor, artillery was actively used during ceremonies associated with royal power.49 Together with Ganusov's and Petrov's pieces, the Tsar Cannon was put on public display near the Frolovskie gates in Red Square (then called the Site of Fire, Pozhar) as if to guard the fords over the Moskva river and the entrance to the Kremlin. The three guns remained there until 1701 when Peter I ordered that Ganusov's and Petrov's barrels be recast into new guns needed for the Northern war. Peter, however, saved Chokhov's Tsar Cannon, as well as another mortar by the master, which can now be seen in the Artillery museum. It was important that the Muscovite super guns could be observed by many people, including foreign diplomats visiting Moscow. Like the large guns of Ivan the Terrible, the Tsar Cannon was commissioned during the period of unrest which engulfed Moscow after the death of Ivan in March 1584. The beginning of the reign of Ivan's son Fedor was marred by two uprisings instigated by competing boyar factions. During the first uprising in April 1584, the rebels tried to turn one of the large guns (Ganusov's or Petrov's) against the Kremlin.50 The unrest of 1584 was followed by another upheaval in 1586. In this context adding Chokhov's huge piece to the guns of Ivan the Terrible, which guarded the royal residence in Moscow, symbolized the continu ity of power in the dynasty and the (alleged) stability of Fedor's regime. The creation of the Tsar Cannon in 1586 also had a diplomatic dimension. With Ivan the Terrible defeated in the Livonian war and the tame Fedor on the throne, Polish-Lithuanian magnates believed 45 Nemirovskii, Andrei Chokhov, pp. 13-14. 46 The vent on the barrel remained undrilled; the barrel's interior was not fully cleaned after casting.

During negotia tions about renewing a truce in 1586, Muscovite diplomats tried to dispel the dismissive perception of Fedor in Poland-Lithuania. Accord ing to them, the tsar was a mature (dorodnyt), sensible (jazumnyi) and happy (schastlivyi) sovereign who governed his domains with his father's blessing; the tsar reigned himself and he was ready to stand against his enemies like his ancestors did; the number of his people had doubled because he was kind to them and generously paid their wages.51 The huge piece produced by Chokhov was supposed to visualize the military might of the Russian tsar, which was questioned in Poland Lithuania. The Tsar Cannon was thus deliberately created to attract publicity. In this respect its iconographie programme, which features an eques trian figure of Tsar Fedor Ivanovich, becomes especially significant. Chokhov's 'portrait' of Fedor is based on the Byzantine iconography of a triumphant emperor and the Muscovite emblem of a horseman.52 In her recent study of Russian political symbols, Magdolina ?goston offers a balanced and inclusive interpretation of this emblem. A horse man was a symbol of grandeur, power and victory since antiquity. In the Middle Ages it was widely used in political imagery across Eastern and Central Europe. A horseman occasionally appeared in the seals of East Slavic princes, including Alexander Nevsky, since the thirteenth century. At the turn of the fifteenth century a horseman became a dominant motif in grand princely seals, probably under the influence of Lithuanian practice. This horseman usually has a crown, which is an attribute of a secular ruler, and lacks a halo. This means that the figure symbolizes not a saint, but a prince, something which is often corroborated by accompanying inscriptions. Sixteenth-century Musco vite sources systematically identify the equestrian figure on coins and seals as the ruling prince. There were many variants in the design of the horseman on seals and coins, including figures with a sabre, a spear and a falcon in hands, with and without a dragon under the horse. Starting from Ivan III, a horseman beating a dragon became a symbol of the ruling prince defeating the Devil.53 As we have seen above, Western artists also linked the image of a horseman with the prince of Moscow in the first half of the sixteenth century. 51 L.

Fedor's face and body are turned in three quarters, but his horse is depicted in profile. Anatomically unrealistic, Fedor's posture represents royal majesty. His figure is less dynamic than the horseman on Mus covite royal seals. Thus, the horseman's cloak on seals is dramatically twisted in the wind, whereas Fedor's cloak is only slighdy bagging. The tsar's long ceremonial robe, rather unsuitable for riding, emphasizes his dignity. The figure of the tsar is thus solemn and majestic. However, his horse is galloping, which is unusual for Byzantine royal iconogra phy, but typical of images of holy warriors slaying dragons or heathens.54 In Chokhov's 'portrait', the swiftly moving horse counter balances the static figure of the rider by adding internal dynamism to the whole composition. Like the Muscovite horseman, Fedor is riding to the right from the viewer. In Muscovite iconographie tradition, this direction of movement is associated with the commencing and active phase of action.55 Fedor is moving towards the gun's muzzle, i.e. in the shooting direction. His figure thereby echoes the potential power of the massive gun. The charge of the tsar is unstoppable like the Tsar Cannon projectile. Fedor's regalia mark his royal status. He wears the Cap of Mono makh, which is shown very schematically, very much like Ivan IV's princely cap in the miniatures of his official chronicle. For some reason, as in Middeldorp's image, Fedor's cap has no cross. In his right hand Fedor holds a sceptre. This may seem a departure from the traditional representation of the Muscovite horseman who, according to standard interpretation, holds a spear in his right hand. ?goston, however, plausibly argues that in Muscovite seals the horseman beats the dragon not with a spear, but with a staff or a long sceptre. According to Metropolitan Zosima, the sceptre was the prince's invincible weapon for defeating the enemies of God.56 In Byzantium, staffs of various lengths symbolized the executive authority and jurisdiction of the emperor. A short version of the royal staff called narthex was used during the ceremony of coronation. In sixteenth-century Muscovy it became known as sceptre (skipetr). Ivan IV started using a sceptre after his coronation in 1547. Frank K?mpfer thinks that Muscovites borrowed a short staff from Byzantium through books and pictures whereas a long staff (posokh) came to Moscow from Novgorod.57 How ever, the sceptre was not originally mentioned in the legend about 54 K?mpfer, Das russische Henscherbild, p. 199. 55 Agoshton, Velihkniazheskaia pechat', p. 369. 56 Ibid., p. 367. 57 Frank K?mpfer, 'Difanihion ?

It is possible that the sceptre was introduced into Muscovite royal ritual as a result of dynastic competition between Ivan the Terrible and Gustav Wasa of Sweden who used a sceptre during his coronation. In Muscovy, the sceptre was used for the first time in the coronation ritual in 1584 when Fedor ascended the throne.58 Muscovite royal staffs were usually of Western origin. Thus, Ivan IV bought a staff, allegedly made of a unicorn's horn, from Augsburg in 1581.59 It was later inherited by Fedor who used it, along with the sceptre, during his coronation. Fedor's sceptre in Chokhov's image also looks like the sceptres of Western kings. Chokhov's image differs from the traditional rendering of the Muscovite horseman in two important respects. First, it lacks the dragon, probably to avoid distracting the viewer's attention from the figure of the tsar. Second, unlike the traditional representations of Muscovite horsemen in seals, Chokhov's Fedor has a halo, which is here a symbol of royal power blessed by God. Chokhov followed a pattern of royal imagery which was established under Ivan the Terrible. In particular, haloes can be seen in the images of princes commissioned by Ivan for the Archangel Cathedral in the Kremlin.60 The horsegear in Chokhov's image is a peculiar mixture of Eastern and Western elements. Fedor's saddle is of a distinctive Mongol type.61 It has short stirrups which allowed the rider to stand when riding and shooting (something Fedor hardly ever did). The saddle also features two belly bands (cinches) and front and crupper straps which prevent ed the saddle from slipping (this is what Fedor obviously needed). The horsegear is lavishly decorated, including a massive raiding chain lying on the horse's neck. Muscovites ordered such chains, which were part of ceremonial horsegear, from L?beck.62 58 Horsey, 'The most solemne and magnificent coronaci?n', p. 272. The first reference to the use of a sceptre during a Muscovite coronation can be found in the formulaic redaction of the coronation of Ivan IV in 1547. Pierangelo Catalano and Vladimir T. Pasuto (eds), L'idea di Roma a Mosca secoli XV-XVI. Fonti per la storia del pensiero sociale russo, Roma, 1989, pp. 79, 85. However, this description is anachronistic. It was compiled in 1557-60 and reflects the growing contacts of Muscovy with Sweden and Constantinople. See Sergei Bogatyrev, 'Ivan the Terrible Discovers the West.

This is in line with the official image of Tsar Fedor which was created in the Faceted Chamber of the Kremlin during his reign. Judging by later descriptions and murals based on original paintings, Fedor was depicted sitting on the throne, with the Cap of Monomakh on his head and a halo around it, holding a sceptre in his right hand. The imagery of the Faceted Chamber put the prince of Moscow in the context of sacred rulership originating in Ancient Israel and culminating in the figure of Fedor.63 Next to Fedor the masters of the Faceted Chamber depicted Fedor's brother-in-law Boris Godunov, who acted as regent under the weak tsar. Chokhov also made a reference to the Godunov family in one of the inscriptions accompanying the equestrian figure of Fedor on the Tsar Cannon. Very unusually for Muscovite weaponry, the inscription glorifies not only the ruler, but also his wife Irina Godunova.64 On the basis of this reference, I. A. Komarov, the Keeper of the Tsar Cannon (Kremlin museums), thinks that the gun was a symbolic response to Godunov's opponents, who tried to divorce Fedor and Irina in 1586 on the pretext of her barrenness.65 While this factor might have played a role, it is important to point out that Irina Godunova became a prominent figure in dynastic politics from Fedor's coronation in 1584. According to Horsey, Irina, wearing a crown and rich clothes, made a public appearance during the ceremony.66 This was a novelty in the Muscovite ritual of coronation because previous princes (Dmitrii Ivanovich the Grandson and Ivan IV) were crowned while they were still unmarried. In this respect, the mentioning of Irina in the inscrip tion on the Tsar Cannon can be seen as part of the new public image of the tsaritsa under Fedor Ivanovich. Uncertainty about dynastic con tinuity resulted in a very specific, masculine image of Irina in official propaganda. She was presented as a decisive, independently acting 63 Aida Nasibova (ed.), The Faceted Chamber in the Moscow Kremlin, Moscow, 1978, images 75-77; Daniel Rowland, 'Architecture and Dynasty: Boris Godunov's Uses of Architecture, 1584-1605', in James Cracraft and Daniel Rowland (eds), Architecture of Russian Identity, 1500 to the Present, Ithaca, NY and London, 2003, pp. 34-47 (pp. 44-45). 64 'This gun was cast on the order of the blessed (blagovernyi) and Christ-loving Tsar and Great Prince Fedor Ivanovich, Sovereign and Autocrat of Ail Great Russia under his pious (blagochestivaia) and Christ-loving Tsaritsa Great Princess Irina in the glorious reigning city of Moscow in the year of 7094, in the third year of his reign.

Furthermore, like the portraits of Aleksei and Peter, the 'portraits' created by Middeldorp and Chokhov belong to different cultural traditions, Western and Muscovite. Middel dorp's and Chokhov's representations of Muscovite royalty reveal similarities and contrasts between Western and Muscovite perceptions of the tsar's power in the sixteenth century. The commissioners of both guns shared common ideas about the political function of gun d?cor. Both representations are based on the symbolism of dynastic culture, including the figure of the ruler and royal regalia, which was generally common in the West and in Muscovy. Chokhov also utilized religious symbolism by depicting a halo around Fedor's head. By contrast, Middeldorp's image makes no references to the religious aspect of the tsar's power. This may be explained by the fact that during the Livonian war Ivan IV's opponents in the West presented him as an enemy of Christianity. Coincidentally, both images represent Ivan and Fedor at the same age (they were twenty-nine in 1559 and 1586 respectively). However, their appearance is very different. Middeldorp shows Ivan as a mature man with a severe frown and a prominent beard. Chokhov's Fedor is very young and clean shaven. This artistic difference reflects different perceptions of Ivan and Fedor as political leaders. By 1559 Ivan became known in the West as a powerful monarch who conquered Kazan' and Astrakhan' and who was waging a victorious campaign in Livonia. Despite the official representation of Fedor as a capable monarch, Chokhov's 'portrait' does not fully dispel the common perception of Fedor as a young person. Such dualism in the official imagery of Fedor served the political interests of Boris Godunov. 67 Isolde Thyr?t, Between God and Tsar: Religious Symbolism and the Royal Women of Muscovite Russia, DeKalb, IL, 2001, pp. 81-103. 68 Godunov's dynastic propaganda culminated in an inscription on the 'Swan' bell (1594) which Nemirovskii attributes to Chokhov. The inscription mentions Fedor, Irina, their newly born daughter Feodosiia, Boris Godunov, his wife Maria and his son Fedor. Nemirovskii, Andrei Chokhov, p. 73.</page><page sequence="25">72 BRONZE TSARS The location of royal portraits on the barrels also has a political con notation. Ivan's head in fact serves as the rear button at the extremity of Middeldorp's barrel (the so-called cascable button or vingrad). The cascable button was used as a leverpoint for elevating the gun. In this sense, the location of Ivan's head at the rear of the barrel is somewhat insulting, because this part of the barrel was supposed to be pulled and pushed when the gun was employed against the tsar's troops. On the contrary, the image of Fedor occupies a very prestigious place on the Tsar Cannon, in the front part of the barrel, on its right side when seen from the gun's rear. This placing was a 'signature' of Chokhov's. The different locations of royal images on the barrels reflect the opposing attitudes of their commissioners to the tsar of Moscow. For the citizens of Reval, Ivan the Terrible was an aggressor who did not want to live in peace with them. At the same time, the Tsar Cannon was an official Muscovite project which propagated the power of Tsar Fedor Ivanovich. Despite all the stylistic peculiarities and different political connota tions, Middeldorp's and Chokhov's images of Muscovite royalty are part of the same process of cultural exchange between Western Europe and Muscovy. Muscovites utilized the Western technology of gun decoration casting for political purposes. In turn, the Muscovites 'exported' a public image of the Russian monarchy which was associ ated with the solemn representation of the Russian tsar in full regalia. Perceptive Westerners like Middeldorp actively drew on this official image of the Russian ruler in their works. Dynastic politics, Russia's military aggression and the growing interest in the figure of the tsar required the visualization of the tsar's power both in Muscovy and in the West. Royal 'portraits' created by Middeldorp and Chokhov were intended not only for the elite, but also for wider circles of the popula tion. They could be seen by townspeople, commoners, artillerymen, soldiers, foreigners. Cast in bronze, the 'portraits' of Ivan the Terrible and Fedor Ivanovich on guns expanded the cultural image of the Russian monarchy.
