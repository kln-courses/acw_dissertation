Effects of mortality on competitive coexistence and coevolution. Past ecological theory suggests that mortality imposed uniformly upon con sumptive competitors will usually hinder coexistence and have little effect on character displacement. These conclusions are in part a consequence of some simplifying assumptions in previous models. Differential equation models of two consumers competing for two or more resources in the presence and absence of a predator species were analyzed to determine the range of relative efficiencies of the consumer species that will allow co existence. These models suggest that mortality imposed by predators can widen the range of relative efficiencies that allow consumer coexistence. Conditions required for this result are that the competing consumers utilize self-reproducing resources and that they do so very efficiently. In this case, the mortality imposed by a predator often prevents the exclusion of the consumers' resources that would otherwise occur via apparent competition. The resulting broader resource base widens the range of conditions allow ing consumer species to coexist. Similar models of two consumers and two resources with evolutionarily flexible consumption rates were also analyzed to determine the effects of predation or mortality on character displacement of the consumer species. The results show that predation is likely to reduce selection for divergent resource use patterns, resulting in higher competi tion coefficients between the coexisting species. Thus, the ecological and evolutionary effects of predators will often have opposite effects on the ease of coexistence of their prey. ABRAMSKY, Z.l and M. L.

Many variables determine the profitability of foraging. These include food supply, habitat, intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, and the threat of predation. Instead of measuring these variables, we have asked gerbils, Gerbillus allenbyi Rodentia, in 1 ha paired field enclosures to con vert them all to the common currency of millet seeds. We add the millet seeds in various quantities (0-48g/tray/night) mixed with large amounts of sand in 18 trays/ha. Gerbil behavior tells us when we are adding seeds at a rate sufficient to neutralize the experimental differences in the variables between our two experimental subplots. The strongest effects come from predation threats. The weakest, only about 1/10 as strong as predation's effects, come from differences in micro-habitat. This is so, despite the fact that our previous work suggests that these gerbils depend upon the micro habitat differences to survive the competition of a larger congener, G. pyr amidum. ACKERLY, D.

Studies of functional variation in chaparral shrubs have focused on three features: carbon gain strategies, water relations, and post-fire regeneration strategies. In this study, we examined numerous ecophysiological, func tional, and phenological attributes in 20 coexisting shrub species to test whether these three axes are independent of each other, and to determine the major axes of functional variation which may contribute to species' coexistence. Quantitative analysis of vegetative phenology demonstrated that there was a continuum of leaf life span, which was negatively corre lated with specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content, and assimilation rates. The deciduous vs. evergreen distinction reflected this variation, but there was no evidence of discrete functional groups along this continuum. SLA was also significantly correlated with realized niche distributions along an exposure gradient of north- to south-facing slopes (i.e., lower SLA in species occupying more exposed locations). Predawn and midday water potentials were positively correlated with leaf size and negatively correlated with basal stem number (a measure of "shrubbiness"), suggesting a major functional axis related to growth form and drought tolerance. This variation was largely independent of SLA and associated traits. There were no sig nificant differences in functional traits between species exhibiting different post-fire regeneration strategies (facultative vs. obligate resprouters). These results demonstrate that leaf size and SLA define two independent axes of functional variation associated with resource acquisition and stress toler ance. ArAIR, E. C. and D. BINKLEY.

Nutrient availability strongly affects the species composition and produc tivity of most upland ecosystems, but the importance of nutrient availability is largely undefined for riparian ecosystems in arid regions of the western United States. The establishment and persistence of cottonwood (Populus spp.) seedlings is dependent principally on an intact flooding regime. This major role of water does not preclude an important role for nutrient avail ability. The uptake and efficient use of water may depend on nutrient sup ply. First year cottonwood seedlings typically extend only about 30cm into the soil. If nutrient supply regulates seedling root growth, higher nutrient availability might allow deeper root penetration, and shorten the 3 to 5 year period required for roots to reach the seasonal water table. To investigate how nitrogen availability influences the composition and productivity of riparian communities, we tested the hypothesis that the development of first year Fremont cottonwood seedlings is limited by soil nitrogen avail ability. Plots of naturally germinated cottonwood seedlings were randomly assigned one of four treatments: Water only, nitrogen only, water and ni trogen, or control. ANOVA analysis of the plots indicated that N was significant for total seedling length (p = 0.05), shoot length (p = 0.01), and root length (p = 0.07). Water addition increased shoot length (p = 0.02) and total length (p = 0.10), but not root length (p = 0.21). Cotton wood seedling establishment therefore appears to be limited by nitrogen availability. Altering the hydrologic regime of a river affects the rates and timing of nutrient cycles. The resulting changes in the patterns of nutrient availability and accumulation could therefore affect ecosystem composition and productivity. ADAMS, P. C. and L. A. VIERECK. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA. Disturbance and succession in interior Alaskan white spruce forests. Models of ecosystem development on the Tanana River floodplain in in terior Alaska portray succession as an orderly deterministic progression of biotic change. Variability in the successional process has been attributed to stochastic factors in early stages of succession, while autogenic processes such as facilitation become more important in middle and late succession. However, long-term monitoring of permanent plots at the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest (BCEF), a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, shows that episodic environmental factors are important in later stages of succession as well. Changes in structure and composition of white spruce forests in interior Alaska may result from small-scale episodic exogenous disturbance. Repeated measurements of permanent plots at BCEF document changes in stand structure and species composition, and these measure ments are linked with environmental measurements made at the same sites. Because canopy structure is an important factor controlling ecosystem pro cesses in floodplain white spruce forests, small-scale disturbances that alter the stand structure, such as top breakage from heavy snowfall, influence the rate of transition from mature even-aged white spruce forests to old uneven-aged stands. This has important implications for climate change because the frequency of occurrence of these episodic events may change, thus changing the rate of succession in mature white spruce forests.

Soil protozoa species diversity can be in the hundreds for a few grams of soil. A considerable number of species are ubiquitous and common in most soils. This tremendous diversity of biochemical and ecological function is theoretically sustainable because of niche separation in time and space through the soil. But it is unclear to what extent this niche separation exists. Some argue that there is considerable niche overlap and protozoa are best grouped into broad functional groups. In general the literature tends to represent the protozoa grouped by size or locomotion. To estimate the ex tent of niche separation in natural systems, three sets of experiments were conducted. The first was an assay of the mobility of a soil protozoa assem blage, using 15 by 2 cm soil columns under various abiotic conditions, with varied soil types. Migration through each column resembled chro Oral Presentation Abstracts 41</page><page sequence="3">matography for chemical separation. Here protozoa were separated by their mobility against an abiotic gradient. Increasing clay content inhibited pro liferation and mobility. The second set of experiments consisted of 75 cm holes dug in an agricultural field and in a more heterogeneous forest soil. Each experimental hole was re-filled with autoclaved soil or sand (free of organic matter) with different litter additions, and plots were kept free of new roots or litter. Control plots contained soil that was dug out and re turned. Re-colonisation of the plots by protozoa was monitored monthly. These results distinguished early colonisers from later successional species, as distinct from fast moving species. Treatments with different litter types (representing various decay rates and nutritional parameters) promoted dis tinct re-colonisation patterns. Lastly, we investigated 3g soil microcosms supplemented with a variety of powdered leaf litter, in a range of moisture content and temperature fluctuations. Each treatment promoted a distinct succession pattern over 1-6 weeks, as the nutrients were used up. Later stages promoted a variety of less common species. Conclusions from these lend support to the emergence in succession, of abiotic and biotic condi tions, promoted by fluctuations in temperature and moisture, which promote particular species. Osmotrophy as well as bacterivory must be considered to appreciate the extent of niche separation in flagellates. ADLER, F R. University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA. Scared stable: Host behavioral response and biological control. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the successful bio logical control of pests with parasitoids or predators at a low stable equi librium, but costly defensive behaviors by the pests have only rarely been considered. In fact, it has been suggested that host defenses might make successful control less likely. However, when aphids, for example, drop off a plant in response to attack by a predator or parasitoid, they suffer a large decrease in expected fitness even when the defense is successful. I use simple models of host-parasitoid interactions to show that such a costly behavioral defense is sufficient to stabilize an intrinsically unstable inter action at a low equilibrium value. Even when costly defenses are induced by a cue of potential attack rather than attack itself, the degree of defense leading to stabilization at a low equilibrium can be evolutionarily stable. I apply these models to the control of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) by coccinellids (Coccinella septumpunctata). ADLER, P R. USDA-ARS, Kearneysville, WV 25430 USA. Ecological and resource recovery approaches to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture production. Agricultural production has become regionally specialized leading to the spatial separation of animal and feed production. This spatial separation has led to nutrient imbalances in watersheds and increases in nonpoint source runoff losses of nutrients to the water environment. When animal manure is viewed as a waste, storage in lagoons is a common management and treatment alternative. Anaerobic storage of manure in lagoons, how ever, degrades its value by increasing offensive odors and air pollutants and reducing organic matter and nutrient content. As a resource, value added processes are used to maximize its value, thereby opening up more market options. In contrast to technological solutions, ecological approach es are less capital intensive and by using ecosystem services, have reduced operating costs. Two nutrient streams from the production of rainbow trout [solids (-10% dw) and overflow water from off-line settling basins for aquaculture solids] were the focus of this study. Solids were mixed with a range of carbon sources from switchgrass and barley straw to hybrid poplar, willow, pine, and oak over a C:N ratio gradient. Course mesh bags filled with the mixture were placed on the soil surface and changes in mass and nutrient content were measured over time. Mass loss from the mesh bags was used as a measure of the bioprocessing rate by the soil ecosystem. Carbon source had a greater effect on mass loss than C:N ratio in this study. Mass loss and N and P sequestration varied with carbon source. Sequestration increased with C:N ratio, but P sequestration was N limited. Overflow water was passed through a carbon biofilter in which microor ganisms utilized the carbon source and nutrients from the water for their growth. More than 95% of the total suspended solids was removed, but performance varied with carbon source. Carbon source is a critical design parameter in optimizing ecological systems for resource recovery. ADLER, L. S. and J. I. YODER. University of California, Davis, CA 95616 USA. Maternal effects and heritability of host preference in a hemi parasitic plant. Generalist parasities may have fitness consequences from their choice of host. However, in order for host preference to evolve, parasites must pos sess the ability to discriminate between hosts and heritable variation for host preference. We conducted experiments to determine whether such var iation exists in the hemiparasitic plant Triphysaria pusilla, which parasit izes a variety of hosts including grasses and the nitrogen-fixer Lupinus nanus. We collected seed from T. pusilla parasitizing lupines or other hosts, presumably grasses, in a coastal grassland. We then assayed maternal sib ships for host preference using seedlings of L. nanus or the grass Bromus carinatus. Host preference was measured as number of haustoria initiated and time to initiation in a no-choice experiment. We found that in general, T. pusilla significantly preferred lupines to grass hosts, but that significant variation between families for host preference existed. In addition, T. pus illa whose maternal parent parasitized lupines showed a greater preference for lupines than T. pusilla whose maternal parent parasitized grasses. We also grew a generation of seed from the same field-collected sibships in a controlled environment without hosts, and assessed the host preference of their progeny. These offspring did not show a preference for lupines over grasses, suggesting that host preference is determined by maternal envi ronment rather than genetics. Thus, some parasites may have a limited ability to evolve in response to selection pressure to parasitize specific hosts. ADLER, P. B., D. A. RAFF and W. K. LAUENROTH. Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523. Effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. When does grazing increase rather than decrease the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation? The influence of grazing on habitat diversity makes this question of interest to conservation management. Our review of the liter ature suggests that, at a given scale, grazing's effect on heterogeneity de pends on the interaction between the spatial patterns of grazing and spatial patterns of vegetation. Three interactions are possible: 1) Grazing increases spatial heterogeneity of vegetation at scales at which grazing pressure is 'patchy' relative to vegetation. 2) Grazing decreases heterogeneity when grazing pressure is distributed randomly relative to vegetation. 3) When the patterns of grazing and vegetation match, heterogeneity usually but not always decreases. While the first interaction, which produces increases in heterogeneity, is intuitively obvious, interactions causing decreases in het erogeneity with grazing are more interesting. In particular, can grazing have different effects on species composition in different ecosystems, but a con sistent effect on spatial pattern? We explored this question with a simple cell-based simulation model of competition between a competitively dom inant plant species and a superior disperser. Random grazing (Interaction 2) and selective grazing on the competitive dominant or the disperser alone (Interaction 3), caused subtle decreases in the spatial heterogeneity of both species, reproducing the pattern we inferred from the literature. Simulations incorporating patchy disturbance produced the same pattern. However, in simulations with underlying environmental heterogeneity the spatial effect of grazing depended on which plant species were grazed. ALLEN, C. D. U.S. Geological Survey, Los Alamos, NM 87544 USA. The relative roles of lightning and aboriginal ignitions in pre-1900 fire regimes, southwestern USA. Some scholars assert that human-set fires sustained most prehistoric fire regimes across North America, including the southwestern USA. I review multiple lines of evidence to assess the relative roles of lightning versus human ignitions in pre-1900 fire regimes in the upland Southwest. A re gional network of dendrochronological fire and climate reconstructions conclusively demonstrates that prehistoric fire patterns (frequency, extent, seasonality, climate and vegetation relationships) are consistent with mod ern observations of lightning-ignited fire activity. Prehistoric fire scars doc ument unusual fire patterns that may indicate human enhancement of light ning fire regimes only in a few localities during limited time periods. Eye witness accounts of Indian burning are rare, and the substantial archaeo logical and ethnographic data-available in the Southwest reveal little 42 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="4">indication of landscape-scale aboriginal fire use. Modern claims of exten sive Indian burning are shown to be based upon a few historic Euro American writings that discounted lightning as a potential ignition source and reflexively attributed almost all fires to human agency, although mod ern fire records show -2400 lightning fires/year in the Southwest (-80% of all ignitions). While aboriginal peoples certainly used fire for many localized purposes, evidence of landscape-scale Indian burning is lacking and lightning ignitions sufficiently explain the record of frequent fire as an intrinsic feature of the Holocene Southwest. Since the ecological history of Southwestern fire involves interactions among both natural and cultural histories, generalizations about "pristine" vs. "humanized" landscape con ditions need to consider the particulars of variation in the relative effects of people through time and space.

Mycorrhizae and restoration in seasonal tropical forests in Mexico. Forest remnants in Quintana Roo, Mexico are subject to frequent fires that escape from shifting cultivation, and will require restoration to break the fire cycle. In September 1997 we planted 756 seedlings of six species of early and late successional trees. We propagated the seedlings in the green house using inoculum collected from a mature forest that has no history of soil disturbance, a two year old forest resprouting from a wildfire, and uninoculated controls. The seedlings were planted into an experimental burn dating from June, the end of the 1997 dry season. Spore densities were greatly reduced after the fire, and root infection was sparse in re sprouts three months after the fire. Soils were high in P, with an average of 50 ppm bicarbonate extractable P. The most effective inoculum in pro moting plant growth was from the early seral forest, which produced the tallest seedlings with the greatest biomass (P &lt; 0.001). The late seral in oculum caused either the second highest growth or the poorest growth, depending on the host tree species. All uninoculated seedlings became in fected from remnant field inoculum by December 1997, but the growth effect of inoculating seedlings is persisting into the third growing season. The different growth responses may be related to the high density of Gi gasporaceae in late seral inoculum, as some species of this family are known to be less effective in promoting growth responses than other spe cies of mycorrhizal fungi. The results show that the species of mycorrhizal fungi are not limiting the regrowth of secondary forests, but the dense, flammable regrowth promotes a continual rapid fire cycle. ALLISON, S.

Turning the tides: Gall-insects benefit from plant de fense biochemistry. We performed enzymatic and histochemical assays of gall tissue and ad jacent leaf tissue in two oak species to determine if gall structures possess unique biochemical compositions that could facilitate gall-insect growth and development. Galls of the cynipid wasp Andricus petiolicolus on chest nut oak (Quercus prinus) had significantly greater peroxidase and invertase activities and lower antioxidant potential relative to host leaves. As com pared to the surrounding gall tissue, the nutritive tissue (eaten by the insect) had a 5-6 fold greater protein concentration but lower peroxidase activity and polyphenol content. A. petiolicolus galls and galls of 12 other species from red oak (Quercus rubra) contained different peroxidase isozyme ac tivities and lower protein concentrations in relation to their host leaves. To determine if gall-insect success is influenced by the status of the host leaf, we wounded galled chestnut oak leaves with gypsy moth larvae (GML) and sprayed them with the wounding-associated plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA). Although short-term wounding with GML was not sufficient to induce changes in foliar biochemistry, chronic application of JA resulted in significantly lower foliar protein concentrations and increased activities of wounding-inducible enzymes. These changes in the host leaves, how ever, had no effect on A. petiolicolus success, measured as percent emer gence from galls. Thus, biochemical patterns typically associated with plant defense (i.e. more defensive enzymes and polyphenols, less protein content) are present in galls and can be induced in host leaves but do not reduce gall-insect success. Rather, gall-insects appear to buffer themselves against negative plant responses. Gall biochemical composition is manipulated by the insect to provide nutrition while resisting herbivory, pathogens, and changes in the biochemistry of the host leaf. ALPERT, P., C. HOLZAPFEL and J. M. BENSON. Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003-5810. Hormonal control of resource sharing in the clonal plant, Fragaria chiloensis. Rhizomatous and stoloniferous plants can increase their overall growth by redistributing resources such as carbon and nitrogen among connected, sep arately rooted plant units, or ramets. In many cases, ramets with relatively low access to resources import them from connected ramets, and resource sharing equalizes the performance of ramets. However, when ramets of Fragaria chiloensis, the beach strawberry, are rooted in patches with rel atively high soil nitrogen availability, resource sharing can make the growth of connected ramets less equal; ramets with high nitrogen grow more, and ramets with low nitrogen grow less if they are connected. We hypothesized that hormonal direction of resource translocation is a mechanism by which clonal plants can concentrate resources in particular ramets in favorable microsites. To test this hypothesis, we applied IAA or cytokinin to the shoot apex of one ramet, fed 15N or 14C to a connected ramet, and measured 'IN or 14C in the ramets, using mass spectrophotometry or autoradiography and scintillation counting. IAA increased the import of N by younger but not older ramets, and had no effect on translocation of C. Cytokinin had no effect on translocation of N. We conclude that auxin synthesis is a mech anism by which F. chiloensis can concentrate growth in young ramets in nutrient-rich microsites. ALTHOUSE, L., F CHAMRAN, J. P. SCHIMEL and V. LACAPRA. Uni versity of California at Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA. California grass land productivity and nutrient availability at the hillslope scale. Landscape position is a primary controller of nutrient availability and mo bility. Between 1997 and 1999 we observed patterns in grassland produc tivity and nutrient availability related to terrain. Ridges had low NPP (above ground net primary productivity) compared to hollow positions. We evaluated the relationship between hillslope position, soil characteristics, and plant productivity, to predict nutrient transport and accumulation using nitrate as our model ion. Similar patterns of nutrient concentration were observed for NO,--N, Na+, Mg++, and Ca++ in 8 soil profiles instrumented with remote water samplers. In California's Mediterranean climate, N min eralization peaks during the moist, warm spring months, and declines dur ing the long drought of summer and early fall. Ammonium production and consumption are 5 times higher in the hollow than the ridge positions, although the highest concentrations of NH4+ were observed at the ridge position in the spring (10 ug NH4+-N/g soil). Nitrate concentrations within the rooting zone (0-20 cm) were highest in the fall with over 20 ug NO3 -N/g soil in the top 10 cm at the hollow position. Below the rooting zone, the hollow position (&lt;200 cm) had the highest concentrations for all ions during the spring. Flushes of nutrient transport occur during periods of high rainfall at the beginning and end of the rainy season, before and after the annual grasses complete their brief life cycle. Nutrient transport is min imized at the height of plant growth and microbial activity during the spring. These patterns are exaggerated at different hillslope positions where hollows tend to accumulate and immobilize more nutrients than the ridge positions. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZ, J. and R. LEON-RICO. Universidad Nacional Au t6noma de Mexico 04510 Mexico. Understorey palm stemflow and throughfall in a Mexican Rainforest. We partitioned rainfall received through canopy in a small plot in a mexican rainforest at the coast of the Gulf of Mexico to measure canopy throughfall and stemflow received. We randomly selected thirty two palms and the same quantity of places out of the palm cover under the forest canopy. Canopy throughfall was intercepted by the foliage of an abundant and efficient litter capturing understorey palm (Astrocaryum mexicanum Liebm, Arecaceae). Stemfiow was measured by harness belts put around palm stems which finished in a bottle to capture stemfiow. In in every plot we put one funnel with its bottle for canopy throughfall capture. Likewise, we put funnels in a gap to measure the total rainfall. Up to 25% of total rainfall Oral Presentation Abstracts 43</page><page sequence="5">was harnessed by the forest canopy. While in the palm areas, almost 30% of throughfall was concentrated by the funnel foliage. Under the palm cover, more than 45% of the gross precipitation was retained or deviate . We measured the nitrate, ammonium and phosphate content of this water flows. We found similar quantities of phosphate and ammonium content in both stemflow and throughfall, however, in stemflow water the nitrate con tent was higher than in throughfall water. Decomposition and mineraliza tion that occurred over litter intercepted by the palm foliage increased sig nificantly-the content of nitrate, and leaching by the water harnessing into the stemflow. Ammonium and phosphate solved in the rain partitions mea sured were produced by the rain deposition from the atmosphere. ANDERSON, K. E., R. M. NISBET and S. D. COOPER.

Streams provide a powerful framework for examining the effects of spatial variation in resource subsidies on complex food webs. Here, a model was examined to investigate how spatial heterogeneity in extrinsic resource in puts interacted with the behavioral and developmental responses of con sumers to resource levels and predation risk to shape patterns of stream organism abundance and distribution. This model described a linear se quence of well-mixed stream habitat patches, with each patch containing an independent carrying capacity and tri-trophic food chain. Patches were connected by unidirectional flow; thus, organisms emigrating from one patch were immigrants to the next patch downstream. Producer, consumer, and predator equilibrium densities all tracked spatial variation in carrying capacity when the responses of consumers and predators were limited to unidirectional, downstream movement. This pattern emerged regardless of the spatial scale at which the variation occurred. The sensitivity of con sumers to variation in resource levels and predation risk and the scale of movement that they could undertake in response affected the equilibrium densities of all members of the food web. When predators were allowed to move upstream as well as downstream, resulting densities approximated an ideal-free distribution, which tended to homogenize consumer densities. More complex patterns of organism distribution occurred when consumers and predators responded to variation in habitat quality both behaviorally and developmentally (e.g., through growth and/or mortality), leading to clumping of consumers at either the initial or terminal ends of the stream or in complete extinction depending on the range of parameter values. Taken in full, these results suggest that complex spatial patterns of stream organism abundance are not due to the scale or magnitude of spatial het erogeneity in extrinsic resource inputs per se; but are rather a result of the mode which consumers and predators respond to such variation. Of partic ular importance is the extent to which consumers and predators can move upstream, which has far-reaching impacts for their persistence and distri bution. ANDISON, D. W. Bandaloop Landscape-Ecosystem Services, Golden, CO 80403. Island remnant patterns of forest fires in boreal forests: Far from random. Using natural patterns as a guide for more ecologically-sound forest man agement activities has become a popular model in the boreal forest region of Canada. The nature of forest fire activity makes the natural pattern strat egy particularly well suited in this area. For instance, the pattern of material left over after fire in islands is an ideal model for leaving residual material in harvesting blocks. However, despite the importance of knowing these details, only two limited studies exist on island remnant in boreal Canada. We embarked on a detailed island remnant study to fill this knowledge gap. Using historical photos, we delineated and classified into survival classes the island remnants of 25 fires in the foothills of west-central Alberta. We found that island remnant patterns were far more complex than originally thought. Although the total area in islands as a percentage of the distur bance area ranged between two and 60%, the average remained a constant 12% with increasing disturbance size, contrary to other studies. On the other hand, the total number of islands increased linearly with disturbance size, with less than 5 for disturbances less than 50 hectares in size, to more than 200 for disturbances over 1,000 hectares in size. We found islands in even the smallest disturbances, also contrary to other studies. Islands less than one hectare in size accounted for over 80% of the total number of islands, at least 70% of which were at least partially disturbed. In fact, only 10-25% of the islands across all 25 fires were completely untouched by fire. Large islands were less likely to be partially disturbed. Finally, approximately 30% of the variation in island locations could be accounted for by topographic features in complex terrain, compared to only 10% of the variation in flatter areas. Where topographic features could not be used to predict island locations, we did find that the general spatial pattern of islands could be represented by a fractal relationship. In the end, we learned that there is more pattern to that which we assumed to be largely a random process. These findings have been invaluable for establishing planning and monitoring goals.

Population-level ef fects of defoliation in the tropical understory palm Chamaedorea ele gans. At this moment, natural populations of palms in many areas are endangered due to overexploitation resulting from poorly designed harvest schemes. We therefore undertook to investigate the long-term effects of sustained leaf removal on the demographic parameters in natural populations of the understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans. In March 1997, individual C. ele gans plants, growing in a natural population were subjected to either of five defoliation treatments: (0, 33, 50, 66 and 100% of the leaves removed). Survival, growth and reproduction were recorded at six months intervals for two years and population-level consequences of defoliation were ana lyzed using matrix models. Sustainable harvesting was defined as a defo liation level at which population growth (lambda) greater than 1 can be sustained for an extended time period. In the first year, reproduction de creased strongly with defoliation while the other demographic parameters were unaffected. Lambda was relatively unaffected by defoliation and lambda was greater than 1 for all levels of harvest levels except the 100% treatment (lambda = 0.967). This result indicates that lambda was rela tively insensitive to changes in fecundity. In the second year, leaf removal negatively affected all demographic parameters and lambda declined strongly with defoliation. The condition lambda &gt; 1 was only met for defoliation levels of 50% or less. These results show that multi-year ex periments are essential in designing sustainable harvest schemes, for long lived species such as C. elegans and most other palms. APPEL, H. M.,' H. L.

True-blue, or blue and untrue? Use and misuse of Folin assays of polyphenols in ecological studies. Ecologists frequently use colorimetric redox reagents (Folin-Denis, Folin Ciocalteau, Prussian Blue) to estimate amounts of "total phenolics". How ever, the color of these reagents is influenced not only by the amount of phenolics present, but also by their structural variation and by non-phenolic reducing agents. Even if two samples have the same amount of phenolics, their Folin-Denis values may differ due to structural variation. We evalu ated the importance of structural variation to the Folin-Denis concentration estimates of purified tannins from 16 woody plant species and 3 commer cial polyphenol preparations. For each species, we generated regressions of Folin-Denis absorbances for a dilution series of purified tannin. The slopes of these relationships differed significantly among tree species, com mercial preparation, and tree sampling dates. Because of this variation, each Folin absorbance indicates concentration only for a given species or sample and absorbances cannot be compared among them. Using a common stan dard worsens the problem. Using commercial 'tannins' as standards pro duced estimates ranging from 40% to 210% of the known concentrations, depending on the tree species. Thus, redox reagents such as the Folin-Denis produce reliable estimates of phenolic concentrations only when standards of purified polyphenols are prepared from the samples of interest. This requires preparing separate standards from each species, each tissue (e.g., leaf age), on each sampling date. We suggest that many published ecolog ical studies testing hypotheses about "investment in defense", "cost of de 44 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="6">fense", etc. are highly suspect if they depended on these redox assays. With appropriate standards, redox reagents can be useful in ecological studies as indicators of redox-based biological activity and as indicators of relative amounts of phenolics. However, redox reagents should not be used to quan tify absolute amounts of foliar polyphenols, or to make interspecific or temporal comparisons using a common standard.

In order to predict species-specific potential to form persistent soil seed banks and to characterize the dynamics of their seed bank, the seed dor mancy/germination traits of seven Polygonum (Persicaria sensu stricto) species sharing lakeshore habitats in central Japan were examined. Strict light requirements for seed germination were not observed in any of the species examined. Although all species required moist chilling (0-6 wks) to break seed dormancy and were sensitive to temperature fluctuation (180 C &lt; 12/240 C), the degree of both responses varied between species. Seed germination of P. hydropiper, P. lapathifolium, and P. longisetum was more accelerated by temperature fluctuation and required shorter chilling periods compared with P. japonicum, P. maackianum, P. thunbergii, and P. sieboldi. Secondary dormancy was induced in all species at higher tem peratures (24? C, 300 C). A persistent seed bank strategy suggested by the dormancy/germination traits of the studied species was also demonstrated by seedling emergence from surface soils collected from the natural habitat immediately before seed dispersal, as well as by viable seed persistence for 13 months in the field in a seed burial experiment. In the natural habitat, the species with longer chilling requirements occurred in various micro habitats, including the interior of moist tall grasslands, whereas the species having higher sensitivity to temperature fluctuation were most frequently found in sparsely vegetated microhabitats. ARMESTO, J. J., C. PEREZ, M. CARMONA and R. GUEVARA. Univ ersidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. Nitrogen mineralization in epiphytic soil in old-growth Fitzroya cupressoides forest, southern Chile. Epiphytic soil is made up of organic matter accumulated under the epi phytic plant cover on branches and trunks of large, long-lived trees. The possibility of an "epiphytic shortcut", where nutrients from epiphytic soil are taken up directly by the host tree, via adventitious roots, or are leached onto the forest floor, makes it relevant to assess the contribution of nutrients from epiphytic soil to the internal ecosystem cycle. We assessed the sea sonal patterns and rates of nitrogen mineralization under the epiphytic mat in large Fitzroya cupressoides (Cupressaceae) trees (mean age=400 years) and in the forest floor. We incubated in parallel epiphytic and forest floor soil samples both in the laboratory and in the field. Ammonium and nitrate were extracted from samples by microkjeldahl distillation. The rate of min eralization was estimated as the slope (k) of the relation of accumulated nitrogen versus time. Mineralization rates varied seasonally, but k values were comparable for epiphytic and forest floor soils. Nitrate and ammonium production ranged between 0.3-3.5 pLg N/g/day for both soils. Net produc tion was high in epiphytic soil at times when forest floor soil had negative mineralization. Microbial activity in epiphytic soil can contribute impor tantly to the internal cycling of N in old-growth ecosystems. ARMITAGE, K. B.,12 D. W. INOUYE23 and B. BARR.2 'Univ.

Implications of changes in hibernation behavior by three high-altitude mammal spe cies, and correlations with climate change. Climate change has had measurable effects on a variety of plants and an imals, including changes in the timing of initiation of the growing season and migration, and even species' distributions. The first evidence of an effect on hibernation behavior of a mammal (yellow-bellied marmot, Mar mota flaviventris) was recently published; marmots are emerging 38 days earlier than they did 23 years ago, perhaps in response to warmer nocturnal air temperatures in April. We present evidence of changes in hibernation since 1974 by two other mammals, golden-mantled ground squirrel (Sper mophilus lateralis) and least chipmunk (Eutamius minimus). Data on the first spring sighting since 1974 at the Rocky Mountain Biological Labo ratory (2,800 m) indicate that, in contrast to earlier emergence by marmots, these two smaller species are emerging later. Spermophilus on average emerge 27 days later than they did in 1974, and Eutamius 12 days later. For Spermophilus, snowpack depth on 30 April is a statistically significant predictor of the date of first sighting (r2 = 0.301, p = 0.005), as is the mean daily maximum temperature in April. For Eutamius these same var iables are also significant, but not as good predictors; for snowpack depth on 22 April r2 = 0.195, p = 0.03, and for mean daily maximum temper ature (MDMT) in April r2 = 0.195, p = 0.04. For both species, mean daily minimum temperatures in April are not significant predictors, leading to the hypothesis that both species are emerging through the snowpack in late April, and using mid-day air temperature as a cue for whether to return to hibernation or remain above ground. Although there is too much scatter for a statistically significant correlation, MDMT in April has tended to decrease (by 1.90 C, 1974-79). This decline has been extraordinary since 1987 (r2 = 0.660, p = 0.001); over this shorter time period MDMT (at the Crested Butte NOAA weather station) has declined 5.70 C. During the study period plant phenology has not changed significantly, so that the interval between first sighting and the availability of food resources such as leaves, flowers and seeds has become shorter for ground squirrels and chipmunks (in contrast to marmots, for which it is increasing). If the date on which they enter hibernation does not change, these species face longer and longer periods of hibernation (already about 8 months). ARNOLD, T. M. and J. C. SCHULTZ. The Pennsylvania State University, University Park PA 16802. Induced poplar leaves call upon imported carbon resources to support the production of chemical defenses: Do source-sink dynamics constrain foliar responses to herbivores? Herbivore grazing commonly induces the production of polyphenols in woody plants, requiring a significant allocation of carbon resources to sec ondary metabolism. However, the precise origin of these resources in plants is unknown. For example, carbon resources may be supplied to the shikimic acid / phenylpropenoid pathway via local photosynthesis, cellular stores, or by the importation of sugars and metabolic precursors via vascular con nections to exporting source tissues elsewhere in the canopy. To evaluate the relative importance of newly fixed vs. translocated resources in the development of induced defenses in Populus seedlings we utilized '3C, supplied as 3CO2 in a flow-through system, as a metabolic tracer. Rates of 13C fixation, import, and export were determined by mass spectrometry for source and sink leaves sharing direct vascular connections. Also, the al location of newly fixed vs. imported 13C to condensed tannins and phenolic glycosides was measured. The application of jasmonic acid, but not me chanical damage, induced condensed tannin accumulation and resulted in an increase in sink leaf 13C import, relative to control plants. Leaf photo synthesis rates were unaffected. Thus, young leaves of Populus induced by tissue damage called upon carbon resources translocated from source leaves. The magnitude of such induced responses and their distribution may be constrained by the availability of translocated carbon resources within plant canopies. ARSENEAULT, D. and L. SIROIS. University of Quebec, Rimouski, Que bec, Canada. Fire frequency and tree species abundance in a stand of boreal forest during the last 5000 years. In this study we examine how black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) have responded to past changes in fire frequency in a small well-drained stand of boreal forest (northern Quebec). More than 300 buried tree remains were extracted from the margin of a peatland where they have fallen from the adjacent study site. Time series of past species abundance were constructed from the age-depth relationship and identifi cation of wood remains to species. Time elapsed between successive fires was estimated from number of tree rings in wood remains. Three periods of short fire intervals (5200-4700, 4000-3 100 and 1600-200 calendar years BP) and two of lower fire frequency (4700-4000 and 3100-1600 calendar years BP) characterized the last 5300 years. Close correspondence between our stand-level data and previously reconstructed episodes of fire occurrence in a large area of northern Quebec suggests climatic control of Oral Presentation Abstracts 45</page><page sequence="7">fire frequency at the study site. Tree species abundance closely followed this long-term trend of disturbance frequency, as reflected by increase of the pine to spruce ratio during periods of high fire frequency.

Prescribed burning to restore mixed-oak com munities in southern Ohio: Effects on breeding bird populations. Fire is being experimentally reintroduced to the forests of southern Ohio to determine its effectiveness in restoring and maintaining mixed-oak forest communities. We studied the effects of repeated burning and recovery on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in temporary and reversible reductions in the availability of leaf litter, shrubs, and saplings, but did not affect trees, snags, or understory vegetation cover. Habitat characteristics did not differ between areas that were burned twice or four times, indicating that repeated burning did not result in cumulative changes in habitat struc ture. Densities of three bird species, the ovenbird, worm-eating warbler, and hooded warbler, declined in response to burning. Population declines were incremental and cumulative in response to repeated burning, and pop ulations did not recover within a year after burning occurred, suggesting a lag time in response to the treatments. Densities of three other species, the American robin, eastern wood-pewee, and indigo bunting, increased in re sponse to burning, but these increases were apparent only after burning had been applied on a repeated basis. Overall, there were no changes in the composition of the breeding bird community; no species were elimi nated or added as a result of burning. As long as the closed-canopy forest structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning, it is un likely that substantial changes in the composition of breeding bird com munity will occur.

Does the temperature sensitive of plant respiration vary among contrasting species and environmental conditions? The response of plant respiration to future changes in temperature will be critical in determining the response of vegetation to global environmental change. Respiration is often temperature sensitive, with the temperature sensitivity often being quantified by the Qlo (the rate at temperature T +10oC/rate at temperature T). Although the factors responsible for varia tions in Q,0 have not been elucidated, changes in the demand for respiratory products, particularly ATP are likely to play a role. We have investigated the extent to which the Ql0 of respiration varies among twenty contrasting herbaceous and woody plant species that differ in maximum potential growth rate and thus demand for ATP Our work has also investigated the impact of the environment (e.g. irradiance, growth temperature) on the Q,0 of respiration. Several potentially fast and slow-growing species were grown under controlled-environment conditions. Leaf respiration rates were measured as CO2 efflux, while root respiration rates were determined using an 02 electrode. Our results indicate that there is little interspecific variation in the Q,0 of respiration, when the Q,0 is calculated over a broad temper ature range. In all species, Qlo values are reduced in stressed plants (i.e. plants grown at very high temperatures) compared to plants grown under more favourable conditions. The temperature sensitivity of respiration also decreases as measurement temperature is increased. Moreover, the Qlo of leaf respiration is dramatically reduced in illuminated leaves compared to leaves in darkness. This has important implications for net photosynthesis and the carbon budget of plants. We conclude that the Ql0 of a small number of plant species may be useful in predicting the temperature re sponse of other species grown under identical conditions. However, the fact that Q-0 values are suppressed in the light and are reduced in stressed plants/high measurement temperatures demonstrates that it is not possible to extend lab-based measurements to plants growing under natural condi tions. ATKINSON, R. B. Christopher Newport University, Newport News, VA 23606 USA. A carbon model of Atlantic white cedar swamps. Atlantic white cedar swamps are peat-accumulating wetlands that occur in the outer coastal plain province from Maine to Mississippi. Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.)B.S.P, an obligate wetland tree, occurs in near monocultures where catastrophic fire eliminates competition. Peat facilitates self-main tenance through hydrologic modification and as seed refugia, which sup ports post-fire regeneration. A carbon model for this ecosystem is needed in order to quantify peat dynamics and to assess ongoing restoration and management efforts. An eight-site chronosequence was studied for three years to determine more than 50 carbon-related structural and functional parameters including production, decomposition and carbon gas emissions. The model suggests that hydrologic variables are important for restoration and management strategies. AUSTIN, A. T.,' 0. E. SALA,] R. B. JACKSON,2 N. LOPEZ' and B. MENDEZ.' 'Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires ARGENTINA; 2Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA. Disruption of nitrification affects carbon cycling in the Patagonian shrub-grass steppe. We conducted a manipulative ecosystem experiment in Patagonia, Argen tina, where we inhibited nitrification (transformation of ammonium to ni trate) in the soil with the use of nitrapyrin. Nitrapyrin is known to target the activity of bacteria in the genus Nitrosomonas, which is responsible for a large fraction of autotrophic nitrification in terrestrial ecosystems. The experimental site was a semi-arid shrub steppe in temperate South America (170 mm mean annual precipitation), with vegetative cover a near equal proportion of shrubs and grasses in a bare soil matrix. We measured nu merous times during the two-year period several ecosystem response var iables including inorganic soil nitrogen concentrations, rates of net min eralization and nitrification, '"N natural abundance of shrubs and grasses, indirect measures of primary productivity of shrubs and grasses, and de composition and nutrient release. Additionally, chromosomal DNA extrac tion was performed on soil samples using standard phenol methods and PCR amplification to assess changes in Nitrosomonas populations. Addi tion of nitrification inhibitor resulted in substantially lower Nitrosomonas populations in soils with the addition of nitrapyrin, particularly in bare soil areas. Soil nitrate concentrations and rates of net nitrification were signfi cantly lower in inhibited soils (P&lt;0.01), but had significantly higher am monium and total inorganic nitrogen concentrations (P&lt;0.001 and P&lt;0.0001 respectively). 15N values of grass foliar samples were signifi cantly more depleted (P&lt;0.01) in the control than in treated plots, sug gesting nitrogen losses were smaller where nitrification was inhibited. However, there was a significant negative effect of nitrification inhibition on total plant aerial cover (P&lt;0.01) and rates of decomposition. These results suggest that disruption in the functioning of the nitrogen cycle may have detrimental effects on plant carbon gain in this semi-arid ecosystem in spite of higher overall nitrogen availability.

Within and among population variation in acclimation to light in white spruce. Physiological responses to sun and shade treatments in the greenhouse were examined in white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings collected from three naturally-regenerated (NI, N2 and N3) and three planted (P1, P2, and P3) stands in the mixedwood boreal forest of central Saskatchewan, Canada. Seedling survival was greater in the sun than in the shade. Dark respiration, light compensation point and quantum yield declined by 70, 81 and 45 % respectively, in shade- compared to sun-acclimated seedlings. Total chlo rophyll content and specific leaf area increased by 33 and 32%, respec tively, in response to shade. At light saturation, populations P1 and N3 showed similar photosynthetic responses (about 6 micro mol m-2 s-') under both light regimes. Populations P2, P3 and N2 performed poorer in the sun than in the shade (8.2, 8.7 and 9.1 in shade, versus 5.1, 4.1 and 5.5 pLmol m-2 s-4 in full sun, respectively). Photosynthetic rate in NI was greater in sun than in shade (14.7 ? 11.1 ,umol m-2 s-', respectively). Differences in physiological responses to light among populations suggest the presence of more than one ecotype. Ni behaved like a true "sun population", show ing the greatest plasticity in the measured parameters, while the remaining populations behaved more like shade-adapted populations. Intra-population variation in physiological parameters was large for both regeneration types. It appears that selection pressure during reforestation was not great enough to cause a decline in intra-population variation in planted compared to naturally-regenerated white spruce seedlings. 46 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="8">AYAL, Y. Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel 84990. The role of habitat productivity and plant structure in the determination of her bivore size and the number of trophic levels in terrestrial communities. The number of trophic levels in a community and hence the relative im portance of bottom-up and top-down forces that control a given trophic level are often argued to be a function of primary productivity, as well as the size of, and metabolic type (poikilotherm vs. homeotherm) of the con sumers. However, I argue that, in terrestrial ecosystems, the interactions among these factors, combined with a fourth factor that is also confounded with productivity, habitat physiognomy, are critical to explaining patterns in the number of functional trophic levels along productivity gradients. At low productivity, small, poikilothermic herbivores such as insects domi nate, both because they require less energy per individual so a viable pop ulation size is more likely and because they are protected from predators even in the low plant cover. As productivity increases, higher densities of larger herbivores can be supported and be sheltered from predators by the increased plant height. However, when habitat productivity is large enough to support large ungulates, other means of predator avoidance start to be effective, such as running speed and living in herds and plant cover is less critical as shelter. I suggest that this shift in the size of dominant herbivores is a major control over trophic structure along productivity gradients. In the least productive terrestrial habitats (deserts and dry grasslands) insects are the dominant herbivores and arachnids and reptiles are the primary predators. Their small size and poikilothermic metabolism then allow pred atory birds to become abundant as a fourth trophic level. In grasslands, shrublands and tundra, small mammals (rodents) become the dominant her bivores and birds and mammals the main primary predators. In bushlands, small to medium size ungulates are the dominant herbivores and they are controlled by large carnivores. However, highly productive grasslands are dominated by large ungulates that live in herds and are less effectively controlled by primary predators. Thus, contrary to current theory, I suggest that the number of functional trophic levels may decrease from four in the least productive habitats to two in the most productive herbaceous ones. This hypothesis suggests profoundly different patterns of trophic regulation along productivity gradients than current ideas. BAACK, E. J. University of California, Davis, CA 95616, U.S.A. Niche differentiation between diploid and tetraploid snow buttercups (Ra nunculus adoneus). Speciation due to chromosome doubling is a common process in flowering plapts. However, ecological mechanisms allowing plants with doubled chromosomes to establish populations have received little empirical atten tion. I examined one putative mechanism, niche differentiation, in diploid and tetraploid seedlings of the alpine snow buttercup (Ranunculus adoneus: Ranunculaceae). In 1999 seedlings were collected from diploid and tetra ploid populations in the Mosquito Range of Colorado and transplanted into two sites with diploid populations and two sites with tetraploid populations. Results of the first year of a reciprocal transplant experiment showed that tetraploid seedlings survived longer and developed primary leaves earlier than diploid seedlings. However, no niche differentiation was detected as seedlings did not show increased growth or survival when planted into a site with their home cytotype. The advantage to tetraploid plants in the early seedling stage could offset the reproductive disadvantages of being a minority cytotype in a population. BABEAU, M. and L. SIROIS. Universite du Quebec a Rimouski, Ri mouski, Quebec, Canada. Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) popula tion dynamics at its eastern distribution limit in Quebec. At their geographical distribution limits, tree species are subject to local extinctions and expansions caused by environmental and climatic alteration of either natural or anthropic origin. This study of 24 jack pine populations at their eastern distribution limit in North America allows us to better understand ecological and physiological phenomena responsible for these limits. Our objective is to characterize and compare the dynamics and growth patterns of jack pine populations in three habitats: Glacial deposit, rocky outcrops, and peat bogs. Moreover, we want to measure the impact of fire suppression since 1973 on these populations. Populations on rocky outcrops have continuous regeneration, even without fire, because of open ing of cones due either to lower serotiny and/or environmental factors, such as high sun exposure. The population on glacial deposit show signs of senescence because of low fire frequency. In this habitat, jack pine dem onstrates: Comparatively fast growth because of a thick deposit; halts in development when it reaches its physiological limit; and lack of regener ation. As a result, there is development of competing species and these populations become depauperate. In a context of lower fire frequency at the eastern distribution limit of jack pine, rocky outcrops, frequent in this region, could become refuges for this species if it disappears in the other habitats.

Existence of the endangered shrub Purshia subintegra is believed to be threatened by hybridization with the more common Purshia stansburiana. Using discriminant function analysis, we found the parents and hybrids had detectable morphological differences that we could use to classify individ uals. We examined plant performance in a common garden experiment. To determine the performance of P.. subintegra and it hybrids across a soil gradient, we collected stem cuttings from P.. subintegra, P.. stansburiana, and hybrids and transplanted rooted cuttings to pots containing one of each of the three parent soils. After 9 months, all plants had the greatest growth in the hybrid soils when compared to P. subintegra and P. stansburiana soils. We next examined the habitat of both parents and their hybrids in the Verde Valley. We found a significant difference between disturbed and undisturbed habitats in the distribution of P. subintegra, P. stansburiana, and hybrids. Washes and roadsides contained a greater proportion of hy brids than undisturbed habitat. Undisturbed habitat contained a greater pro portion of P. subintegra. Increased road construction and human distur bance in the rare P. subintegra habitat may increase the invasion of hybrids and have implications for the management of this rare species. BAILEY, J.

The interaction of fire intensity and elk herbiv ory on aspen regeneration and arthropod biodiversity: An intermediate burn hypothesis. Fire burn severity has direct effects on aspen regeneration, and indirectly effects elk herbivory and insect diversity. Furthermore, the intensity of elk herbivory also affects insect diversity. In 1996, the Hochderfer crown fire burned approximately 15,000 acres of montane forest in Northern Arizona. This fire presented an opportunity to examine the direct and indirect inter actions of fire and herbivory on above-ground aspen productivity, and in sect diversity. Using experimental elk exclosures established by the U.S. Forest Service, and manually cutting aspen ramets, we addressed three questions: First, how does burn severity and elk herbivory affect above ground aspen production? Second, how does burn severity and elk herbiv ory affect insect diversity on a stand level? Third, what is the relationship between above-ground aspen production and insect diversity? Fire posi tively affected above-ground aspen productivity where areas of high burn severity had the strongest effect. Elk herbivory negatively affected pro ductivity, and had the strongest effect in zones of high burn severity. Fur thermore, fire and elk herbivory had different effects for insect communi ties, and interacted so that the intermediate severity burn zones, with mod erate levels of elk herbivory had the highest insect diversity. Finally, in termediate levels of productivity had the highest levels of insect diversity. These data are important because they demonstrate that abiotic (fire) and biotic (elk herbivory) factors can have complex interactions which impact aspen stand productivity and the biodiversity of associated insects. In the western U.S., because we manage forests for large ungulate herds and we suppress natural fire regimes, we virtually eliminate the regeneration of aspen, a keystone species in montane ecosystems, and effectively decrease montane ecosystem biodiversity on multiple trophic levels.

To predict NPP and C storage, terrestrial ecosystem biogeochemistry sim ulation models rely on assumptions about the mechanistic basis for carbon Oral Presentation Abstracts 47</page><page sequence="9">and nutrient mineralization within the soil organic matter (SOM) pool. Despite this, few (if any) empirical measurements of C and nutrient min eralization rates have been made which are suitable for calibrating an eco system model. We use radiocarbon measurements to empirically calibrate a 3-pool model of C and N dynamics for a chronosequence of California annual grassland sites ranging in age from &lt;3000 to -3,000,000 years, while other soil-forming factors remain constant. On these time scales, mineral weathering causes considerable changes in nutrient availability and soil texture, variables known to control SOM dynamics. We measured the 14C/'2C ratio of soil organic matter (SOM) in 150 cm deep profiles from four terraces sampled circa 1949, 1978 and 1998-a period spanning the pulse 14C enrichment of the atmosphere from H-bomb testing. An advective transport model is used to interpret SOM turnover and transport as a func tion of soil depth, so that SOM can be partitioned into 3 pools with distinct turnover rates and C:N ratios. We find that the C:N ratio of fast-cycling SOM increases with soil age from roughly 12-15 to 20-25, indicating decreasing litter quality. Similarly, the inferred residence time of slow cy cling SOM increases from --15 years to -21 years. Overall, the model provides estimates of nutrient turnover which are consistent with those derived from biomass harvests. Thus, we believe that this approach-com bining %C, %N and '4C data with a mass balance model-may provide valuable empirical constraints for ecosystem biogeochemistry modeling. BAKER, W. L. University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071 U.S.A. In dians and fire in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. How we interpret the abundance and geography of pre-EuroAmerican In dian-set fires may be fundamental to the direction and meaning of our land management practices, particularly our use of fire. I identify four models of burning by Indians in the U.S. as argued in previous literature: (1) pervasive and significant, (2) spatially varying and significant, (3) varying significance, and (4) enhancing. I critically review information relevant to these models in the Rockies. Sources include early accounts by non-native scientists, explorers, and early settlers, oral history from Indians, and tree ring and pollen/charcoal studies. Early accounts by EuroAmericans may suffer from observer bias, but more fundamental limitations that I show are that: (1) reliable first-hand accounts of ignition are a small percentage of total accounts, and (2) even informed observers in the late 1800's did not appear to know that fires could be started by lightning. More reliable oral histories from Indians are very limited, but do suggest that Indians burned to some extent, and had a variety of reasons for doing so. Tree ring studies are free of potential biases inherent in accounts and oral his tories. Spatial comparisons of known high-use areas and remote areas sug gest burning by Indians elevated fire frequency in used areas. I argue that pollen and charcoal analyses are inconclusive because the purported signal of burning by Indians can also result from weather-related increases in fire. Reliable evidence of burning by Indians is much less than reported previ ously. The limited evidence best supports the "varying significance" model. We know primarily that some Indians did burn intentionally and acciden tally, at least in some dry ecosystems where their uses were concentrated, but there is no evidence of burning in some other areas. While strong conclusions may never be warranted, the burden of proof should shift to those who would counter the hypothesis most suggested by the limited evidence: Indians were a small part of a large Rocky Mountain wilderness, with a fire regime, in much of the mountains, essentially free of human influence for millenia.

Hydrologic variability, organic matter supply, and denitrification in the Garonne River ecosystem. Groundwater nitrate contamination has become a worldwide problem as increasing amounts of nitrogen fertilizers are used in agriculture. Alluvial groundwater is uniquely juxtaposed between soils and streams. Hydrologic connections among these subsystems organize nutrient cycling in water sheds. We hypothesized that spring floods would flush soil-derived dis solved organic matter (DOC) into groundwater, and this would in turn fuel denitrification in a nitrate contaminated portion of the Garonne watershed. In situ acetylene block assays and measures of system biogeochemistry and hydrology were used to test this hypothesis. During high flow (mid-April to early June) the water table rose an average of 30 cm in monitoring wells. This was associated with a slight increase in DOC concentration. Denitri fication rates nearly doubled during the high flow period, averaging 2.91 ug N20/L/min during baseflow compared to 5.05 ug N20/L/min during spring flood. Higher denitrification rates during spring appeared to be re lated to a change in DOC quality. While there was no seasonal difference in specific UV index, low molecular weight organic acids made up a greater proportion of DOC during high flow. These molecules are likely derived from decomposition of soil organic matter and are an important energy source for anaerobic respiratory processes like denitrification. This study highlights the importance of floods as major organizers of terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem interaction. BALIAN, E. V. and R. J. NAIMAN. University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Growth and production of dominant riparian trees in the Pacific Northwest coastal rainforest. Few published studies focus on productivity and growth processes of ri parian forests in the Pacific Northwest, despite the importance of riparian forests in stream structure and function. The objectives of this study are to identify growth patterns for dominant riparian tree species and production processes of riparian forests related to geomorphic and successional char acteristics. The research area is located in the low valley of the Queets River, on the western coast of Washington's Olympic Peninsula. The dom inant riparian species in the Queets river valley are red alder (Alnus rubra) and willow (Salix sp.) in the younger stands, and Sitka spruce (Picea sitch ensis) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) in the mature stands. Cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), vine maple (Acer circinatum) and big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) appear as intermediate species in older stands. Sixteen plots have been established on three different templates: active floodplain (&lt; 20 years), paleo-floodplain (30 to 70 years) and low terrace (80 to &gt; 500 years). Basal area and density are annually recorded for each plot. Early successional plots colonized by young alder and willow (&lt; 20 years) show the highest density (22000 to 35000 trees/ha) and the lowest basal area (7.4 to 18 m2/ha), while mature stands (400 to &gt; 500 years) are characterized by low density (248 to 588 trees/ha) and high basal area (64 to 97 m2/ha). A total of 564 trees are being surveyed for growth between April and October (growing season), by using dendrometers (50 trees) and sequential measurements. The first results for 1999 show that western hemlock has the greatest average basal area increment per tree (&gt;100 cm2/growing season), while red alder in younger plots exhibits the highest total basal area increment per surface unit (1.09 to 2.1 m2/ha/grow ing season). Cottonwood's basal area increment tends to occur later in the Fall, following the first important precipitation. Results on growth pro cesses are being used to develop a semi-quantitative model describing pro duction process changes taking place over time. This model will give an estimation of the time riparian species require to begin supplying the aquat ic system with woody debris. BALICE, R. G.,' S. W. KOCHI and S. R.

To accomplish this we sampled 76 plant communities over a two-year period. The field data include topo graphic information, soils characteristics, understory fuels and vegetation and overstory canopy structures. The data were summarized and analyzed using linear modeling techniques. From these analyses, it was found that both overstory and understory fuels are related to linear and quadratic representations of topographic and remotely sensed variables. As an ex ample, the final regression model for percent canopy cover was significant (F = 16.23, P - value &lt; 0.0001) with an R - square of 0.571. This and other regression models are being used as inputs of conditional simulation to predict fuel levels at unsampled pixels within the study area. 48 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="10">BALL, M.

Photosynthesis is sensitive to low temperatures, with freezing conditions naturally inducing chronic photoinhibition (i.e., light-dependent decrease in efficiency of photosystem II) in over-wintering leaves of eucalypts and other evergreen species. Analysis of in vivo fluorescence characteristics in field grown leaves of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) showed that chron ic cold-induced photoinhibition is due to a previously unknown chloro phyll-carotenoid-protein complex that facilitates extremely rapid non-ra diative dissipation of absorbed light energy without a requirement for a transthylakoid pH gradient. This photoprotective complex may be critical to survival of evergreens during winter when leaves are least able to cope with excess irradiance. A unique spectral emission band signifies the re versible formation of this novel photoprotective complex. High resolution hyperspectral imaging was used to measure spatial variation in light re flected from leaf surfaces. These data were used to map spatial variation in reflectance associated with the novel photoprotective complex (r2 = 0.92). Apparent concentrations of the complex were lowest near leaf centers and increased toward leaf tips and edges, consistent with the spatial pattern in leaf temperatures and freeze-induced changes in chlorophyll content and a/b ratios. These data provide explicit spatial linkage between environmen tal stress and physiological responses to it. BANACK, S. A., M. HORN and A. GAWLICKA. California State Uni versity, Fullerton.

Fish, Brycon guatemalensis, have been proposed as the major dispersal agent for a fig tree (Ficus glabrata) at La Selva, Costa Rica. Figs, in general, are known for their non-specific (generalist) strategy of fruit dis persal. They represent an important part of the diet of a large number of animal species during the dry season and are often referred to as "keystone resources". We tested the null hypothesis that fish are the major disperser in this system by examining other potential seed dispersers. In addition, the distribution of the fig was examined in further detail. We determined that the fig was restricted to riparian habitat greater than 7 meters in width. In addition, the fig was limited by micro-habitat requirements and not seed dispersal. We identified four mammalian seed dispersers [kinkajou, howler monkey, and two species of fruit bats] that contribute to seed dispersal in Ficus glabrata. We established that Ficus seeds that pass through the guts of bats are viable. We demonstrated that light is the dominant factor lim iting the establishment and growth of this species through greenhouse ex periments. Using reciprocal transplants we showed that seedling establish ment is a critical recruitment stage for this species and that transplants of established plants rather than seeds or small seedlings have a greater chance of survival.

Available studies suggest that differences in vulnerability of herbivores to parasitoids is often associated with differences in herbivore behavior or morphology. The latter are often species-specific traits important in host finding for parasitoids specializing on particular taxa (i.e., "taxon-specific" parasitoids). However, there are also many parasitoids that are habitat or niche specialists and select related and/or unrelated hosts, occurring in sim ilar or identical habitats. Host selection may be a function of cues associ ated with the host's food or shelter, as well as those associated with host phenology, voltinism, or abundance. Leaf-feeding macrolepidopteran larvae were collected from black willow (Salix nigra (Marsh)) and box elder (Acer negundo L.) in riparian habitats. Larvae were reared individually to deter mine sources and levels of parasitism. Observed pattern of parasitism of macrolepidoptera over five years provides insights into variation in host species use by an array of different parasitoids. Although over the 5 years 23.45% of collected larvae were parasitized, because host species were so scarce, for only 18 (of 58) species were more than 10 individuals reared (over the 5 years). Among the 58 parasitoids species, 42 were associated with hosts on box elder, 41 with hosts on black willow, and 25 attacked hosts on both tree species. Thirty three parasitoid species had at least two hosts and some were reared from as many as 5 to 6 host species. In this habitat sharing of hosts by parasitoids is commonly observed, although the realized degree of sharing may be less than the potential degree of sharing. BARDGETT, R. D.,' D. A. WARDLE2 and L.

Patterns of below-ground microbial community develop ment in primary succession: A study of recently deglaciated terrain in Alaska and New Zealand. Many studies have examined patterns and processes of primary succession and community development that occur above-ground. However, there is a dearth of information concerning patterns of primary succession that occur below-ground, and how these changes relate to those occurring above ground. This study aimed to examine patterns of soil microbial community development, measured by phospholipid fatty acid anaysis (PLFA), in a range of soil chronosequences of different aged geological substrates. We will present data from two classic primary successions on recently degla ciated terrain which are characterized by severe nutrient stress in later stag es of succession, namely: (1) the Franz Joseph Glacier in New Zealand which encompasses &gt; 22, 000 years of primary succession, and; (2) the Muir Glacier at Glacier Bay in Alaska, which encompasses &gt; 14,000 years of succession. Our data reveal that, in accordance with changes in above ground plant biomass and soil organic matter status, total soil microbial biomass (total PLFA) in the surface soil increases by 3-4 fold during pri mary succession from bare gravel to climax forest (i.e. spruce-hemlock forest on terrain of 230 years old at Glacier Bay and rata-kamahi forest on terrain of 1,000-5000 years old at Franz Joseph). This change in total microbial biomass is attributed to an increase in the abundance of fatty acids synthesised by gram-positive bacteria (il5:0, a15:0 and i17:0) and fungi (18:26), and is associated with a shift, over time, in the composition of the soil microbial community towards increasing fungal dominance over bacteria. The abundance of the fungal fatty acid and the ratio of fungal: bacterial PLFAs was at its highest in soils of old-growth forest (&gt; 10,000 years old), suggesting that these later stages of succession, which are char acterised by severe nutrient stress, have a microbial community that is very much dominated by fungi. The eventual replacement of old-growth forest to low-diversity bog, which occurred after some 14,000 yrs at Glacier Bay and 22,000 years at Franz Joseph, was associated with dramatic declines in total microbial biomass (total PLFA), fungal biomass (18:26) and the ratio of fungal:bacterial PLFA.

Whole tree conductance and leaf gas exchange in Eucalyptus saligna trees of different heights. We tested the hypotheses that 1) whole tree conductance is lower in tall (about 25m) compared to short (about 7m) trees, and 2) that decreased conductance limits photosynthesis in tall trees. We measured whole tree sapflow, leaf level gas exchange and leaf water potential in tall and short trees in a fast-growing Eucalyptus saligna plantation on the island of Ha waii throughout the summer in 1999. Sapflow per unit sapwood area av eraged 45% lower in tall trees compared to short trees; however, the av erage sapwood area to leaf area ratio was 50% greater in tall trees compared to short trees so tree height did not affect sapflow per unit leaf area. Leaf water potential in the tall trees averaged 0.7 MPa more negative than the short trees throughout the day. In this study, the negative effect of increased path length of water flow in tall trees was compensated for by the adjust ment in the sapwood area to leaf area ratio and the ability of tall trees to maintain high rates of conductance at more negative water potentials.

These stands, established in 1996, were planted at densities ranging between 741 and 4448 trees ha-'. Total stem volume growth increased cur vilinearly with increasing stand density. Overall, loblolly pine had signifi cantly higher foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous than did slash pine. For loblolly pine, foliar nitrogen concentration decreased sig nificantly from 1.31% to 1.02% as stand density increased. Foliar phos phorous concentration in trees growing at 741 trees ha-' was significantly higher than the 2224 and 4448 trees ha-' stands, but not than trees growing at 3706 trees ha-1. For slash pine, foliar nitrogen concentrations decreased from 1.13% to 0.91% as stand density increased. Foliar phosphorous con centrations at these same densities also decreased as trees ha-1 increased, but the decrease was not significant. Rather than being related to nutrient concentration, total stem volume growth was closely related to total nutrient content of the canopy, which was a function of nitrogen concentration and leaf area.

Sidalcea nelsoniana is native to wetland prairies of the Willamette Valley, Oregon and is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Be cause of extreme habitat loss, the current distribution of S. nelsoniana might not indicate its complete hydrologic requirements. Moreover, pro posals by land managers have suggested flooding some sites for an addi tional six to eight weeks into spring to improve wetland habitat. The pur pose of this study was to evaluate the flooding tolerance of S. nelsoniana and to predict the effect of extended inundation on its performance. Rhi zome fragments were transplanted into pots exposed to four flooding con ditions: Drained soil, saturated soil with no standing water, standing water from mid-November until mid-April, and standing water from mid-Novem ber through mid-June. Treatment differences were most notable starting in April. Plants with drained soil died as the spring rains declined. Plants flooded past April died by mid-June. Plants in saturated soils and those flooded until mid-April were the most successful, and did not differ sig nificantly in survival; number, height and cover of leaves; and number and height of flowering stems. These two treatments most closely match con ditions found in Willamette Valley wetland prairies, including S. nelsoniana sites. This suggests that the current distribution of S. nelsoniana approxi mately matches its hydrologic requirements and that flooding a S. nelson iana site beyond mid-April may harm this protected species.

Arizona pine stand dynamics: Local and re gional factors in a fire-prone Madrean gallery forest. In southwest North America, large-scale synoptic climate patterns exert control on moisture availability, fire occurrence, and tree demography, rais ing the compelling possibility of regional synchronization of forest dynam ics. Such regional signals may, however, be obscured by local, site-specific factors. We examined Arizona pine (Pinus arizonica) in lower and middle Rhyolite Canyon, Arizona, contiguous sites with similar physical environ ment. Fire history was similar in the two sites from 1660-1801, but then diverged, possibly as a result of a local flood. We related stand dynamics to fire history and drought severity and compared the two sites before and after the divergence in fire frequency. Arizona pine exhibited three age structure peaks: two (1810-1830 and 1870-1900) shared by the two sites and one (1610-1640) only in middle Rhyolite. The latter two peaks oc curred during periods of unusually low fire frequency, suggesting that fire induced mortality shapes age structure. Evidence was mixed for the role of favorable moisture availability in age structure. Moisture availability had a prominent positive effect on radial growth, whereas the effect of fire was largely neutral. The two sites differed only moderately in stand dynamics during the period of divergence, exhibiting subtle age structure contrasts and, in middle Rhyolite only, reduced growth during a 49-year fire hiatus followed by fire-induced release. These results suggest that, despite local differences in disturbance history, forest responses to regional processes persist. BASSIRIRAD, H. and D. NYBERG. University of Illinois at Chicago. Species-specific responses of tall-grass prairie legumes to nitrogen ad dition. Many prairie ecosystems in the tall-grass region of the U. S. A. have ex perienced recent elevations in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. We tested the hypothesis that increased N deposition decreases growth and the competitive ability of five native legume species: Amorpha canescens, Bap tisia leucophaea, Cassia fasciculata, Cassia hebecarpa, and Desmodium canadense. Individuals of each legume species were planted together with an individual of a C4 prairie grass species, Andropogon scoparius, in a 4 L pot containing river-washed sand. Plants were grown for 10 weeks under field conditions. Twice a week, each pot received 200 mL of nutrient so lution that contained 0.1 mM N supplied as ammonium chloride plus po tassium nitrate at one of the following concentrations: 0.0, 0.2, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, or 10 mM. Nitrogen addition significantly affected growth of all spe cies tested and much of the effect was species specific. In the range of 0.0 to 2.0 mM, nitrate addition increased total biomass in B. leucophaea, D. canadense and A. canescens to a greater extent than the competing grass, so in this N addition range, these legumes out-competed the grass. At 5 and 10 mM, nitrogen addition decreased growth of B. leucophaea and A. canescens while growth in the grass species was either increased or unin hibited. Therefore, N addition at the two highest concentrations reduced the competitive ability of these legumes relative to the grass. D. canadense outperformed the grass at all N concentrations, but its biomass response to N addition reached a maximum at the 2 mM treatment. A. canescens and C. fasciculata produced less biomass than the grass at all N treatments except at the highest concentration. The pattern of nodule dry weight re sponses to increased N was similar to total plant biomass. The interspecies differences of legumes to N loading may have significant implications for N cycling and biodiversity in tall-grass prairies. BATEMAN, H. L. and M. A. O'CONNELL.

Primary cavity-nesting birds play a critical role in forest ecosystems by excavating cavities later used by other birds and mammals as nesting or roosting sites. We examined the abundance and use of habitat by primary cavity-nesting birds during winter in prescribed burned and unburned stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Several species of cavity nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to win ter conditions. Although breeding success and summer habitat selection of birds have been evaluated in prescribed burned forests, much less focus has been on habitat selection of wintering birds. Winter bird surveys were conducted from 1998 to 2000 using a variable point count method. Bird abundances were associated with habitat data in three prescribed burned and three unburned stands. Preliminary results show that prescribed burned and unburned stands are similar in total bird abundance, but different for individual species and guild abundances. Foliage gleaners are significantly greater in unburned stands, whereas bark foragers are significantly greater in burned stands. Individual species are further differentiated by specific habitat variables within stands. This juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important in maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage. BATES, J.,' T. SVEJCAR,' R.

Climatic variability has historically influenced plant community dynamics and distribution in the Great Basin of the United States. During the past 2 million years plant communities in the region have been less stable than was previously assumed. Thus, impacts of short and long-term climate shifts are relevant to understanding and managing Great Basin ecosystems. The objective of this study was to assess effects of altered precipitation patterns on plant community dynamics in the sagebrush steppe of the Northern Great Basin. Five rainout shelters were constructed to control season and amount of precipitation at the Eastern Oregon Experimental Range in Burns. Precipitation under the shelters was applied with a sprin kler system. Treatments under the shelter were Winter, Spring, and Current. 50 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="12">The Winter treatment received 80% of its moisture between October and March. The Spring treatment received 80% of its moisture between April and July. The Current treatment received moisture conforming to long-term distribution patterns. Shelter treatments received 205 mm of moisture an nually. A Control treatment was located outside each shelter and received natural precipitation. Herbaceous cover increased in all treatments between 1994 and 1999. Bareground was greatest in the Control as a result of lower litter cover and/or greater plant cover in the shelter treatments. In the shel ters, bareground in the Spring treatment was significantly greater (P&lt; 0.01) than Current and Winter treatments. In 1998 and 1999 herbaceous cover and production were significantly lower (P&lt; 0.01) in the Spring versus other treatments. The Winter treatment was most favorable to annual pro duction and cover indicating the importance of winter and late spring pre cipitation to this functional group. There was little emergence and growth of annuals in the Spring treatment during the study. Herbaceous reproduc tive success and seed weights were significantly lower (P&lt; 0.01) in the Spring versus other treatments. Sagebrush cover increased slightly but did not differ among treatments between 1994 and 1999. Sagebrush reproduc tion success and floret weight were significantly greater in the Spring versus other treatments in 1998 and 1999.

The effect of overstory structure and sky condition on light transmittance in a Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) forest. Sun elevation and sky condition interact with canopy structure resulting in a heterogeneous understory light environment. A study was initiated to investigate the relationship between forest canopy structure on light pat terns in the understory of a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. Four tree harvest treatments were applied to create a gradient of gap sizes resulting in overstory heterogeneity. Light quantity was measured continuously with photo-diodes to assess understory irradiance through a range of climatic conditions from August 1998 to June 1999. Our objective was to determine if light transmittance was affected by: (1) direct- versus diffuse- dominated sky conditions; and (2) heterogeneity of the forest overstory structure. We found an interaction between (1) and (2). On clear days, light was more variable in the understory light environment of the small gap treatment than in the large gap treatment. On overcast days, variations in the under story light environment were not as pronounced. Total transmittance was greater in large than in small gap stands on direct light dominated days but the difference on diffuse light dominated days was not as great. BATTAGLIA, L.,' P R.

Fifteen years of old-field succession and reestablishment of a wetland forest. The bottomland hardwood forest of the southeastern US has been called an "ecosystem in crisis". Conversion to agriculture, logging and hydrologic modification have contributed to loss of habitat coverage and quality. The extent to which these forests can reestablish naturally on abandoned fields has not been studied. We examined vegetation dynamics over 15 years in a 3.2 ha field, abandoned in 1984. Relative elevation, strongly correlated with flooding depth and frequency, varied by approximately Im. Ground layer composition was measured in twenty 1m2 quadrats, stratified along the elevation gradient. Shrubs and tree saplings Im in height were mapped (n = 1556) and their relative elevations determined. Non-metric multidi mensional scaling ordinations revealed that, although species composition shifted between years, it was consistently correlated with elevation. Logis tic regression showed that the distribution of each sapling species was strongly related to elevation. Sapling densities were higher at higher ele vations, where Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Celtis laevigata, and Ilex decidua dominated. At lower elevations, sapling densities were low, with sparse clumps of Cephalanthus occidentalis. Mature individuals of most sapling species occurred adjacent to the field. Oaks were absent in the study area as well as the bordering forested levees, although young planted oaks at a nearly restoration site had high survival and growth. Our study suggests that vegetation dynamics in these abandoned floodplains is strongly influ enced by elevation and that composition of nearby forest fragments may affect secondary successional patterns.

Longterm effects of N deposition and elevated CO2 on resource competition of temperate forest seedlings: A community response experiment using open top chambers. Temperate forests are predicted to play a key role as important sinks for atmospheric CO2. This sink could be enhanced by atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. The predicted response may vary for deciduous and conif erous trees due to differences in nitrogen use efficiency. We have investi gated the effect of elevated CO2 and N deposition on seedlings of three deciduous (Betula alleghaniensis, Quercus rubra, Acer rubrum) and three coniferous species (Pinus strobus, Picea rubens, Tsuga canadensis). The study comprises a factorial design consisting of two CO2 treatments (am bient and elevated), two N treatments (ambient N deposition and ambient plus 50kg N ha-' y-l) and three community types (deciduous, coniferous and mixed species communities). We predict that high N deposition will remove or reduce the N-constraint on enhanced productivity in elevated CO2 by allowing plants to acquire more N. Data on height growth during 1999 indicate however that conifer growth response to elevated CO2 is greater at low N whereas deciduous seedlings showed a greater response to elevated CO2 at high N. This growth response was confirmed by data for photosynthetic capacity and N partitioning. At high N availability de ciduous trees allocate relatively more N into Rubisco than conifers, thus making it impossible for conifers to use a surplus supply of N at elevated CO2 for an increase in carbon assimilation. These results suggest that there is a trade-off between the growth of deciduous and coniferous seedlings in response to CO2 and increased N availability depending on the photosyn thetic N use efficiency.

We describe the development of a model simulating alternative humming bird foraging strategies and compare predictions of each version of the model with foraging data from the field. We tested the hypotheses that: 1) natural foraging patterns more closely resembled systematic foraging than random foraging; and 2) systematic foragers were more efficient when re source distributions were clumped versus random. Simulated foraging strat egies included random searching, area-restricted searching, and directional searching. During field trials and simulations, hummingbirds foraged in patches with uniform (saturated), clumped, and random nectar distributions. We measured foraging efficiency as microliters of nectar consumed per time step, assuming higher rates of consumption were more efficient than lower rates of consumption. In random patches, the hummingbirds in the field foraged the most efficiently, while the field data and area-restricted searching methods proved the most efficient in clumped patches. The ran dom searching strategy proved more efficient in patches with random ver sus clumped nectar distributions, while the area-restricted searching strat egy was more efficient in clumped patches. No difference existed between patch types for the directional search strategy or the field data. In the uniform patch, the directional strategy performed the most efficiently, fol lowed by the random and field foraging strategies. The area-restricted searching strategy resulted in the least efficient foraging. This study sug gests hummingbirds use different foraging strategies in different patch types and use information not incorporated into the simulated foraging rules. BAXTER, J. W. and J. DIGHTON.

Six replicate 1, 2 and 4 species mycorrhizal com Oral Presentation Abstracts 51</page><page sequence="13">munities were generated by random draws from a pool of 6 fungal species. Each unique species combination was replicated four times in order to distinguish compositional effects from that of mycorrhizal richness. When assessing host responses, we used the realized diversity rather than the initial inoculated diversity of the treatment. Multiple mycorrhizal coloni zations were successful in almost all cases and no colonization was ob served on the controls. Mycorrhizal colonization per m seedling root length increased from the 1- to the 4-species diversity treatment. Seedling shoot mass decreased from 1 to 4 species of mycorrhizal fungi, while root mass increased across this range of species richness. Despite higher mycorrhizal colonization rates with increasing fungal diversity, there was no relation ship between colonization rate and either shoot or root mass. Our results suggest that higher mycorrhizal richness per se, rather than differences in species composition or higher colonization rates, lowered shoot mass and increased root mass in laboratory-grown birch seedlings. Increased com petitive vigor among the competing fungi and consequent greater carbon allocation to roots at the higher diversity levels may explain these results. BEACH, E. W.' and C.

Controls on conifer regeneration in managed riparian forests: Effects of seed source, substrate, and vegetation. Alnus rubra is a dominant overstory component in many of the managed riparian forests of the Pacific Northwest. It is commonly assumed that competition with shrubs inhibits succession from hardwoods toward shade tolerant conifers. However, we are not aware of any studies that empirically test this assumption. We hypothesized that seed availability rather than competitive interactions largely shape patterns of conifer regeneration in these forests. At 10 locations in western Washington, paired transects rep resenting riparian sites with abundant vs. few seed sources were used to examine the importance of dispersal limitation, rooting substrate, and veg etation cover on conifer regeneration. Frequencies and densities of shade tolerant conifers (Tsuga heterophylla, Thuja plicata, and Picea sitchensis) were significantly greater in transects within 100 m of remnant forest patch es than in paired sites at a greater distance (frequencies of 59 vs. 18% and densities of 0.227 vs. 0.163 individuals m-2, respectively). Where sources of seed were present, regeneration was positively associated with coarse woody debris and negatively associated with fine litter. Regeneration was most abundant in plots with low (&lt;10%) herb or shrub cover, however for most species, recruitment occurred in plots representing the full range of understory cover (0 to 90 [100%]). No relationship was observed between regeneration density and overstory conifer or hardwood tree cover. Our results suggest that conifer regeneration is controlled primarily by the avail ability of seed and only secondarily by possible competitive interactions. In intensively managed landscapes, conventional strategies, such as vege tation control, are not likely to be as effective in increasing conifer regen eration as managing for seed sources through green-tree retention. BEATTY, S. W. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO. Disturbance "leg acy" in forest communities. Sources of pattern in the landscape include natural and anthropogenic dis turbance, topographic variation in physical parameters, and biological in teractions (such as exotic species). The "legacy" of disturbance effects can lead to persistent impacts, some of which should be considered a "natu ralized" part of an ecosystem's physical environment, rather than an effect of disturbance. For example, treefalls create light gaps that host a number of species temporarily in an otherwise light-limited forest ecosystem. How ever long after the treefall light gap has closed, the soil mounds and pits remain as features of the forest floor. These micro-features maintain nu merous species in the forest understory by providing a "choice" of mi crosites during years of extreme environmental variation, leading to a low variance in population size over time. Species on mound microsites have greater biomass production, higher proportion of species populations un dergoing sexual reproduction, and higher frequency of occurrence in the forest community. Although the proportion of forest floor covered by mounds and pits is similar, mound species are ubiquitous, while pit species are often rare in the community. Variability in species composition for pits is much higher than for mounds. Any forest area in the northeastern U.S. that was cleared and plowed, has a "legacy" of a more uniform forest floor (no microtopography, homogeneous A-horizon depth and fertility, lower organic matter content, low variance for means of soil variables across space). There are fewer species in the understory, fewer species overall which flower every year, and variation in population sizes is more extreme when microtopography is scarce. In considering how best to manage or restore for the benefit of biodiversity, we are going to need to incorporate the "legacy" of disturbances, in addition to active disturbances, into the plan.

Tree seedling survival and growth in southern Appalachian forests: Effects of canopy gaps, understory removal, trenching and fertilization. A central goal of forest ecology is to understand the factors that promote tree diversity and, thus, would allow accurate predictions of future forest composition. The recruitment of tree seedlings plays a major role in deter mining later forest composition. Therefore, we investigated seedling sur vival and growth of three tree species, which are important components of eastern forests, under manipulated microenvironmental conditions. We planted three first-year seedlings each of Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tuli pifera, and Quercus rubra in 1m2 plots with one of five treatments: Re moval of all understory vegetation (&lt;2m), trenched, trenched plus removal of understory vegetation, fertilization, and a control. These treatments were replicated in 12 paired canopy and gap environments for a total of 1080 seedlings. We fit parametric survivor models to the survival data and linear models to the seedling growth data. At the end of the first two years, species had a large effect on survivorship with Q. rubra having the highest survival (68%), followed by A. rubrum (41%) and L. tulipifera (10%). Survivorship of seedlings was higher in canopy gaps (45%) compared to closed canopy (34%), as well as in all treatments compared to controls. In contrast to survival, L. tulipifera had a relative growth rate (for seedling height) that was more than 50% higher than for either A. rubrum or Q. rubra. Relative growth rates in canopy gaps were 45% above those in closed canopies. Trenching, trenching plus removal of understory vegetation, and fertiliza tion all resulted in relative growth rates 35% greater than in controls, while removal of understory vegetation lowered growth rates by 5%.

Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an aggressive invader in the Great Basin deserts. A shadscale shrub community in western Utah shows a mosaic of cheatgrass invasion that ranges from highly resistant patches (diameter = 5-15 m) with less than 15% cheatgrass cover to highly susceptible patches (diameter = 5-15 m) with greater than 90% cheatgrass cover. This study investigated whether resources in the highly resistant patches limit cheat grass biomass. In ten patches at each of three life stages (establishment, overwintering, and active growth) and across all stages combined, resourc es were manipulated directly and indirectly. We applied four treatments (reduced competition from native grasses and forbs, or water, nitrogen, or litter additions), a combination of all four treatments, and an untreated control, and measured their effects on cheatgrass biomass. Life stage by itself had no significant effect on biomass. Patches that received a combi nation of all treatments had a 141% increase in cheatgrass biomass in comparison to the control. Of the four individual treatments, reduced com petition from native species and nitrogen addition increased biomass by 164% and 38%, respectively; water and litter additions had no effect. These findings indicate that highly resistant patches do not provide adequate re sources for cheatgrass. Competition from the native grasses and forbs ap pears to limit the population of cheatgrass at this spatial scale within this shadscale shrub community. BEEBEE, M. D.'l2 and L. R.

We assessed the impacts of vertebrate herbivores on a mature, maritime chaparral community, excluding small (rodents), medium (rabbits), and large (deer) mammals from experimental plots. Rodents had greater neg 52 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="14">altive impacts on herbs than did deer and rabbits, and did so consistently even in years with very different rainfall patterns and basal amounts of biomass. Rodent feeding also altered plant community composition through preferential feeding on grasses: grasses, in particular, benefited from rodent exclusion, with a doubling in average biomass; forb biomass was not changed. Rabbits caused no significant changed in the biomass of either forbs or grasses. However, while deer had an immediate negative impact on herbaceous biomass, they enhanced plant biomass over longer time scales. BEERS, I. T. UCLA, Los Angeles, CA USA. Do southern California harvest refugia enhance target fish populations? During summer and fall of 1997 and 1998, we censused adult and juvenile fishes at three island and two mainland sites, which represent the majority of rocky-bottom no-take marine reserves in southern California. This study is unusually robust because five reserves were sampled in a single biogeo graphical area. Results demonstrate the first significant finding of increased density of harvested species (Paralabrax clathratus, kelp bass and P. ne bulifer, barred sand bass) inside California marine reserves. Harvested spe cies were also larger inside the reserves. There were significant differences in fish populations among sites. In contrast, non-harvested species did not show significant increases in density or size according to protection status. Habitat characteristics of the reserve and control areas were not signifi cantly different. This study demonstrates that southern California no-take areas lead to increased numbers and sizes of harvested fish species. BEISNER, B. E. University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C. V6T 1Z4. Pelagic food web responses to temporal heterogeneity. The pelagic environment within which plankton live varies in space and time. Upwelling events that arise at various frequencies from storm and wind events have been associated with nutrient pulsing. This phenomenon has been well studied in laboratory chemostats but the response of phy toplankton in the presence of the entire plankton food web in the field has yet to be determined. A series of mesocosm (5000L) field experiments investigated the response of phytoplankton community structure in the presence and absence of higher trophic levels, in systems of low and high productivity, subject to intermittent upwelling at high (3-5 days), inter mediate (15 days) and low (21-30 days) frequencies. Natural phytoplank ton communities responded to temporal heterogeneity in upwelling only under enriched conditions; Daphnia modified the response of the phyto plankton community, while a complete zooplankton community eradicated the response of phytoplankton. There was also some evidence to suggest that the frequency with which intermittent vertical mixing occurs had con sequences for higher trophic levels. Finally, it was apparent that the effect of upwelling goes beyond simple nutrient pulsing, especially in oligotro phic systems. Changes to organismal encounter rates as a result of turbulent mixing and altered light regimes likely play equally important roles. BEISSINGER, S. R. and B. K. SANDERCOCK. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U. S. A. Sex-biased dispersal affects source-sink dynamics of a parrot metapopulation. Source-sink dynamics are difficult to demonstrate, and do not consider the role of sex-biased dispersal on metapopulation processes. We present re sults from 10 years of demographic studies of Green-rumped Parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela that demonstrate large differences in de mography of males and females within and between two populations sep arated by only 0.5 km. Our study area consists of "upland" and "lowland" sites that differ in elevation by 1-2 m and soil type, but not in rainfall or air temperature. These slight environmental differences result in large dif ferences in the onset of nesting in some years. Upland females laid smaller clutches, had higher nesting success, and produced more clutches per year than lowland females. Multi-state mark-recapture models indicated that lo cal survival of breeding and nonbreeding adults did not differ between sites. However, juvenile females emigrated at much higher rates than males, and juvenile dispersal was highly biased toward the upland site. Not surpris ingly, upland birds had higher fitness than lowland birds when rates were combined into a matrix model to calculate lambda. However, immigration was needed to sustain populations except for the upland site, which served as a source for resident males and a sink for resident females. BELNAP, J., R. L. REYNOLDS,2 M. REHEIS2 and S. L. PHILLIPS.' 'USGS-BRD, Moab, UT 84532; 2USGS, Denver, CO. What makes the desert bloom? The contribution of dust and crusts to soil fertility on the Colorado Plateau. Eolian dust (windblown silt and clay) and biological soil crusts are both important to ecosystem functioning of arid lands. Dust furnishes essential nutrients, influences hydrology, contributes to soil formation, and renders surfaces vulnerable to erosion. Biological soil crusts contribute directly to soil fertility by fixing carbon and nitrogen, and indirectly by trapping new ly-deposited dust and stabilizing already-present soil. Results from crust stabilized, unconsolidated sandy sediments on prominent rock exposures and grasslands show dust inputs have significantly increased all bioessential nutrients in soils of South East Utah, including P, K, Mg, Na, and Ca. As plants can be P and K-limited in these soils, dust may be essential for plant growth. Petrographic and magnetic analyses reveal that a large component dust particles have been derived from igneous rock areas. This result and the particle-size data indicate long-range (10s to 100s KM transport), per haps as distant as the Mojave desert. Dust in the biological soil crusts, when compared to underlying sediment, show higher magnetite, Zr, and Zr/Ti, suggesting that dust sources have changed over the past few decades. It is suggested that recent human disturbance in areas surrounding the Col orado Plateau may be responsible for this change in dust source. BELOVSKY, G. E. and T. A. CROWL.

Population viability analysis (PVA) has become an important part of as sessing the likelihood of threatened/endangered species persisting under various conservation scenarios. One common PVA approach assesses pop ulation growth rates and their variance using time series analysis and then incorporates these values in diffusion models for population growth to fore cast the likelihood of extinction over a chosen time period. An experimental data set on extinction dynamics developed using brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, in replicated laboratory populations varying in initial numbers, carrying capacity and environmental variability was used to test the validity of this PVA approach. Two questions were addressed: 1) How well does this PVA approach predict extinction probabilities using a complete ex tinction data set (i.e., replicated populations followed until all become ex tinct); 2) how well should this PVA approach work when the time series for threatened/endangered species are of much poorer quality than the ex perimental data. The findings for both questions suggest that this PVA approach is subject to errors reducing its utility in conservation planning. BENO, C. C.,' M. D. COLEMAN2 and A. L.

Fine root dynamics of a developing forest in re sponse to nitrogen. We examined the hypothesis that increasing soil N increases fine root pro duction in an establishing forest. This hypothesis is pivotal to our under standing of environmental controls over belowground net primary produc tion in forest ecosystems, and existing data on this question are ambiguous. A cottonwood plantation was established and plots within it received 0, 50, 100, and 200 kg N ha -1. Time-release fertilizer was used to prevent dis turbance effects associated with large pulses of N. Root observation tubes (minirhizotrons) were used to follow production (sum of new root length), mortality (sum of missing root length), and standing crop (net amount of root length present). The study was maintained for two years. Fine root production and mortality increased from the first to the second year, irre spective of treatment, as the site became more completely exploited. Sec ond year production was more than 40% higher and mortality tripled, which resulted in double the live-root standing crop compared to first year results. In support of the hypothesis, fertilized plots generally had high production and low mortality compared to the control plots. Initial results show that the 200 N treatment had the greatest amount of production and intermediate fertilizer levels had the lowest mortality rates resulting in a high final stand ing crop. The 0 N control had relatively low production and high levels of mortality, resulting in a low- standing crop by the end of the second year. Oral Presentation Abstracts 53</page><page sequence="15">Consequently, preliminary results show that fertilized plots tended to have higher standing crops than the control. Because seedlings were planted in the first year, these results represent the response of young cottonwood in an intensively managed plantation and may differ from the response in mature forest stands.

Spatial temporal factors and their influence on subsequent tree species re cruitment in secondary terre firme forests of Central Amazonia. Factors influencing tree species recruitment are well studied in Central America but less prevalent in the Central Amazon Basin (Manaus, Brazil). Recent studies have established that tree species recruitment richness is elevated within 100m of a mature forest edge for 20 year old stands. This study extends the spatial and temporal scale of these earlier conclusions to 6.4 km and 40 years, respectively, in order to determine the influence of landsccape structure and composition upon tree species recruitment rich ness, statistically. 29, 10 by 100m transects were established in secondary forests (4-40yo) measuring species, DBH, position, and stand age. The surrounding landscape structure and composition was quantified via GIS and remote sensing to measure fundamental landscape metrics. Multiple linear regression analysis detected landscape structure and composition as having a significant influence in predicting species richness, even after correcting the data for age. From these findings, a spatially explicit hier archical scale model was developed to assess t'e spatial scale at which these landscape level phenomena were occurrins, at. With the use of spatial regression models landuse scenarios will be e- aluated in terms of sustain abilty (of species richness) to quantify their utility in preserving biological species diversity.

Nitrous oxide mole ratio dur ing denitrification in soil: Evidence for an interaction of ecosystem and recent moisture history. The nitrous oxide mole ratio (N2O / [N20 + N2]) represents the fraction of denitrification that results in N20, a radiatively active trace gas that con tributes to the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The ratio is difficult to investigate because of high spatial and temporal variability and because of the difficulty in making direct measurements of N2 flux from soil. We collected soil from three replicate 1-ha plots for each of two ecosystems conventionally-tilled, high-input corm-wheat-soy rotation ('cropped') and 10-year-old native succession-at the W K. Kellogg Biological Station LTER site. Soil was sieved, air-dried, and incubated in jars for 24 hours with nitrate (15N-labeled or unlabeled), glucose, and water (85% water-filled pore space) to stimulate denitrification. One set of jars received 80% of total water 48 hours before the start of the incubation. Gas chromatography (GC) with acetylene inhibition was used to assess N20 and N2 production. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) was used to assess N2 production and to estimate non-destructively the enrichment of the soil nitrate pool. For soil from cropped sites, mean N20 mole ratios measured by gas chro matography were 0.36 for the 'pre-wet' incubations and 0.90 for controls. For successional sites, ratios were 0.34 for pre-wet soils and 0.33 for con trols. By ANOVA, the mean for cropped-site controls was significantly different from the others. There was a significant interaction of ecosystem and recent moisture history (P = 0.012). We attribute the interaction to differences in the abilities of the soils to maintain the status of the deni trifying enzyme nitrous oxide reductase (Nos). Apparently Nos status was maintained rather well in the successional soils, but declined with drying in the cropped soils and was re-induced quickly with the onset of anaerobic conditions. For N2 production, IRMS methods gave estimates that were about 0.34 of GC estimates. Yet estimates of enrichment of the soil mineral pool using N2 data agree well with those from N20 data and with mass balance predictions. At present, we cannot explain unequivocally the dis crepancy between the methods. BERINGER, J.,I CHAPIN III,1 I. MCHUGH2 and N. TAPPER.2 'Univer sity of Alaska, Fairbanks, Alaska 99775, USA; 2Monash University, Aus tralia. Observations on the role of tree line in controlling atmospheric circulations. Previously it has been considered that the position of the northern limit of boreal tree line was controlled by the summertime position of the arctic front. Recently, however, Pielke and Vidale have suggested that instead the position of the northern tree line may influence the position of the arctic front through contrasts in surface heating over the tree line. This study expands on their work by providing observational measurements on the energy balance contrasts between arctic tundra and boreal forest at Council on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. Here the boreal forest had a lower albedo and hence absorbed more incoming radiation. The forest also had less ground heat flux due to greater canopy closure, resulting in generally larger sensible and latent heating over the forest. Midday values of sensible heat flux were 250 Wm-2, which was 50 Wm-2 greater than the adjacent tundra. Measurements of boundary layer profiles suggest that this increased heating causes deeper and drier boundary layers over the forest. These ecologically induced contrasts impose a significant influence on climate through the manipulation of synoptic scale weather features such as the arctic front. These biotic influences need to be considered in assessing possible future vegetation and climate change in the arctic. BERNTSON, G.,' G. BAUER2 and R.

Nitrogen deposition and NPP in temperate forests: The role of leaf physiology, foliage turnover and canopy structure. There is growing evidence to suggest that tilc impact of N deposition on temperate forest productivity, even in the absence of N 4s-turation, may not be as great as several studies suggest. Further, most studies of die impact of N deposition on forest processes have ignored changes which take place in the canopy. To date, there have been no empirically-based, ecosystem scale studies of how N deposition alters canopy processes and thus the potential for C gain in forests. We initiated a study of how N deposition affects the physiology, dynamics, and structure of temperate forest cano pies. We are examining how the partitioning of N within tree foliage and how it is affected by N deposition, and how these changes in N allocation relate to changes in photosynthetic capacity. In addition we are examining the effects of N deposition on foliage retention time and canopy structure in order to begin scaling changes in leaf-level processes to the entire can opy. Our study is based at the Harvard Forest Chronic N Experiment, where a long-term (12-yr+) of N deposition (+5 and +15 g N m-2 y-l) on both coniferous and deciduous forests is underway. Our preliminary measure ments (within a Pinus resinosa stand) demonstrate that foliar N content has significantly increased, and that this increase is accompanied by a de coupling of the Photosynthesis-N relationship. Preliminary evidence sug gests that the de-coupling is due either to increased production of non photosynthetic proteins (e.g., Calvin cycle enzymes) or an excess produc tion of Rubisco. The net effect of this de-coupling is that the large increases in foliar N we have observed are not accompanied with increased photo synthetic capacity. Further, we have found that needle life-span has been significantly reduced, and, even with apparent increases in foliar production (at the expense of wood production), standing leaf area has decreased. Taken together, these data suggest that potential C gain by the Pinus re sinosa canopy has been significantly reduced by long-term N deposition. BESTELMEYER, B. New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA. The interaction of soil texture and vegetation as a deter minant of ant diversity in semiarid landscapes. An important problem facing conservation biologists and land managers is to understand patterns of species diversity at the scales of human-defined landscapes. Animal community ecologists have emphasized the role of fac tors such as competition in determining diversity patterns at relatively small scales, whereas biogeographers have revealed the importance of climate and energy at broad scales. I argue that a distinct set of processes produce patterns at the scales of landscapes, and hat understanding these processes is essential for conservation planning. I considered the hypothesis that veg 54 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="16">etation pattern was the primary determinant of pattern in ant communities in three 100-kM2, semiarid landscapes. These landscapes were located along a biogeographic gradient from shortgrass steppe, through a transitional area, to desert grassland. I found that patterns of ant richness and composition were best explained by soil texture in each landscape, but that particular plant species may also play a role depending on the region considered. In desert grassland, some ants were associated directly with creosotebush, Larrea tridentata. When this plant shifted its association with soils between regions, ant community composition was shuffled. These results suggest that vegetation pattern may not provide a good representation of diversity pattern for ant taxa in some situations, and that soil texture and other soil properties may be important variables for conservation planning.

The coexistence of competitors may result from host-specific interations with other trophic levels. We have accumulated evidence of strong negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community. Specif ically, we have found that the presence of a plant results in a host-specific change in the composition of its soil community (in both the community of mutualists and pathogens) and this change in the soil community often decreases the growth rate of that plant species relative to that of a second species within our grassland study system. While this negative feedback suggests that the dynamics within the soil community can contribute to the maintenance of diversity within plant communities, it does not identify the importance of these feedbacks in plant species coexistence relative to other potential factors, such as interspecific competition. In this study, we tested the importance of the soil community feedbacks using a series of experi ments on two co-occurring perennial grasses, Anthoxanthum odoratum and Panicum sphaerocarpon. Negative soil community feedbacks accumulate rapidly (within three months) between these two species and could there fore generate negative frequency dependence within a single growing sea son. We tested this prediction by planting mixtures of Anthoxanthum and Panicum at a range of densities and frequencies, and planting these mix tures into pots filled with sterile soil or pots inoculated with living soil. We found no measurable frequency dependence in the growth rates of Anthoxanthum and Panicum when grown in sterile soil, with Anthoxanthum always having a higher growth rate than Panicum. Therefore, Anthoxan thum is predicted to exclude Panicum in sterile soil. However, in living soil, the relative growth rate of Anthoxanthum and Panicum depended on their initial frequency, with Panicum having higher growth rates than An thoxanthum when it was initially rare. This negative frequency dependence will contribute to the coexistence of these competitors. These results sug gest that the dynamics within the soil community are critical to the coex istence of these two competitors. BIEDENBENDER, S. H.,' M. P. MCCLARAN,2 J. QUADE2 and M. A.

Differences in carbon isotope values between above and belowground plant material for 15 semidesert grassland species. Consistent lifeform-specific differences in the magnitude of the range in d'3 values between above and belowground plant material would have se rious implications for the interpretation of the commonly observed pattern of less negative d'3C values of soil organic carbon with increasing soil depth, and the reconstruction of the contributions of C3 and C4 components of past vegetation. In this study, the d'3C values for above and belowground plant biomass were compared for 15 semidesert grassland species. The d'3C values for belowground material were significantly less negative than the aboveground material for nearly 50% of the species, but only 1 of 5 grass species had different values, compared to 6 of 8 C3 woody species. The direction of the difference (belowground was less negative) was consistent with the limited number of previous reports, and the magnitude of the difference (l-3%o) was also largely consistent for the C3 shrubs and forbs, but our result for the C4 grasses was smaller than expected from previous reports. Based on our results, where belowground material was 1-3%o less negative than aboveground material for C3 shrubs, but only 0.5%o less neg ative for C4 grasses, commonly used mixing formulas based on above ground d'3C values would overestimate the contribution of C4 grasses to past vegetation. However, more field research examining the d'3C values of soil organic carbon must be completed to confirm the life-form specific variation found in the plant material reported in this study.

The importance of ant-tending to maternal care in the treehopper spe cies, Publilia modesta. We examined the relationship between maternal care and ant-tending in the treehopper species, Publilia modesta. Ant-tending increased the number of nymphs eclosing to adults on plants approximately fivefold. Maternal care increased the number of nymphs eclosing, but only in the presence of ants. Maternal care increased the average number of ants tending nymphal ag gregations early in the summer; consequently we suggest the primary ben efit of maternal care is to attract ants while nymphs are small and few in number. Because there is no benefit of maternal care in the absence of ants, we conclude that ant-tending provides an ecological context that favors maternal care in this treehopper species. BILLINGS, S.

Growth and reproduction of many desert plant species are limited by the availability of water and plant-available nitrogen (N). It is theorized that atmospheric CO2 may increase plant water-use efficiency, and thus increase net primary productivity (NPP) in deserts; however, we do not know how higher CO2 levels will affect soil N availability. We are investigating the effects of elevated CO2 (550 ppm) on soil N transformations at the Nevada Desert FACE (Free-Air Carbon Enrichment) facility in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem. We examined soil N20 and CO2 fluxes, ammonia vola tilization, and N-mineralization under three plant species and in plant in terspaces, under both ambient and elevated CO2. N20 fluxes were unde tectable in all seasons tested. Nitrogen mineralization was significantly higher under shrubs (27.9 ? 4.4 p1g gsoil-'), and lowest in plant interspaces (8.0 ? 2.8 j.g gsoil-), where plant litterfall is minimal. Losses of N via NH3 volatilization were appreciable (0.73 ? 0.12 vs. 0.65 ? 0.07 jig NH3-N m-2 d-I with ambient and elevated C02, respectively). These data suggest a trend of lower losses under plant canopies than in interspaces, and lower losses with elevated CO2. Soil CO2 flux rates were significantly higher with elevated CO2 (49.2 ? 12.5 vs. 17.6 ? 6.5 plg m-2 h-1, P &lt; 0.05); this data can serve as a proxy for underground microbial activity, especially in plant interspaces where roots are scarce. In conjunction with NH3 losses and soil CO2 data, this suggests microbial activity is highest where carbon supply is least limited. Our data indicate that soil microbial activity, and thus N immobilization, may increase in an atmosphere of elevated CO2. This change in N availability to plants may counteract any potential gains in NPP caused by increases in water-use efficiency. BINCKLEY, C. A. and W J. RESETARITS JR.

That predation plays a critical role in determining community structure is inarguable. However, many aspects of how predators impact communities are not fully understood; in particular, the relative importance of non-lethal effects verse direct mortality. For example, habitat selection, as manifested in processes of colonization such as oviposition site choice, has the poten tial to affect community assembly in a very different manner than direct predation or other non-lethal effects. We present the results of two exper iments demonstrating that female treefrogs (Hyla squirella and Hyla chry soscelis) respond to the simple threat of predation by caged fish predators (Enneacanthus obesus, Umbra pygmaea, and Gambusia affnis) by laying significantly fewer eggs in artificial ponds containing any of these predatory fish. In the first experiment, we used 16 paired cattle watering tanks (eight fishless controls and eight tanks containing seven F. obesus), each con taining fish enclosures to eliminate all physical interactions between E. Oral Presentation Abstracts 55</page><page sequence="17">obesus and H. squirella. A total of 33,128 eggs were recorded with only 1,727 (5.2%) of those from ponds containing caged E. obesus. In a second experiment, we established 36 wading pools with fish enclosures to deter mine if H. chrysoscelis females avoid two other fish species, U. pygmaea and G. affinis. Of the 92,997 eggs recorded in this experiment, only 5,200 (5.6%) were from pools containing U. pygmaea or G. affinis. Females of two species of treefrogs showed strong avoidance of three very distantly related species of fish, thereby determining the initial distribution and abun dance of their larvae in multi-pond systems. These data demonstrate the role of past predator-prey interactions in determining the habitat preferences of female anurans, and illustrate the potential importance of maternal be havior as both a determinant of larval success and a factor in the structure of aquatic communities.

A single-tree approach to age-related decline in stand growth. The growth of forest stands typically declines after reaching a peak near the time of canopy closure. Our previous work looked for a stand-level explanation for this pattern. In this presentation, we present results of sin gle-tree patterns in resource use and production. Twenty-five Eucalyptus trees in a 10 by 10 m, monoculture plot were examined for stem growth, water use, light interception, and canopy nitrogen content. Dominant trees generally used resources more efficiently. For example, stand growth per unit leaf area was almost twice as high in dominant trees (0.5 kg wood/M2 leaf area) than in suppressed trees (0.3 kg wood/M2 leaf area). If all trees produced as much wood per unit leaf area as the better half of the trees, then stand growth would be 24% higher for the same total stand leaf area. If all trees used N as efficiently as the better half of the trees, growth would be 15% higher for the same quantity of N in the total canopy. This decon struction of the stand-level growth supported the idea that differentiation in tree sizes through stand development leads to stand-level decline as a result of shifts in single-tree resource use, and growth per unit of resource used.

Carbon budgets and net ecosystem productivity of two contrasting boreal black spruce ecosystems in central Saskatchewan. Boreal forests are of great interest because they store a large amount of carbon in the soil and because of their pivotal role in the global carbon cycle. The objective of this study was to compare the carbon budget of two similar-aged boreal black spruce ecosystems with contrasting structure: Closed-canopy black spruce with a feathermoss ground cover and open canopy black spruce with sphagnum ground cover. Soil carbon content was over two-fold greater for the open- versus closed-canopy black spruce eco systems, which suggests that annual carbon accumulation is over 100% greater. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of the overstory was two-fold greater for the closed- than open-canopy black spruce stands, but the ground cover NPP was over three-fold greater for the open- than closed canopy black spruce stands, resulting in a similar aboveground NPP. Be lowground NPP was roughly proportional to ANPP. Because of lower de composition rates, the net ecosystem production of the black spruce - sphagnum ecosystem was greater (more of a sink) than that of the black spruce - feathermoss ecosystem. The results from this study illustrate the profound influence small differences in edaphic conditions can have on ecosystem carbon dynamics, and the need to better characterize the spatial heterogeneity of canopy structure and ground cover composition on eco system carbon dynamics.

Intrametapopulation com petition: Implications for population and metapopulation persistence. Theory for metapopulation dynamics typically assumes that interaction be tween subpopulations occurs solely through dispersal. However, for species in which the life-cycle consists of several stages that occupy different hab itats, subpopulations may experience density-dependent dynamics, such as competition, in common habitats. One case where this may occur is in metapopulations of anadromous salmonids in which individuals from geo graphically and temporally distinct spawning populations aggregate and interact over increasing spatial scales in common freshwater migration cor ridors and marine habitats during the course of the life cycle. Classical dispersal between populations in these metapopulations occurs as maturing adults return to spawning habitats other than that in which they were born. I develop analytical, numerical and simulation models to explore the im plications of intrametapopulation competition for metapopulation dynamics and for the fate of individual subpopulations. Results from these analyses indicate that relative 1) local population size (a function of habitat size or environmental quality) is a strong determinant of individual population persistence, 2) population persistence is a function of the relative strength of local versus global density-dependent mechanisms, 3) increased com petition in common habitats increases the likelihood that marginal or at risk populations will go extinct, 4) intrametapopulation competition in creases the proportion of non-natal spawners in a depleted population, and 5) that competition may moderate (or exacerbate) the effects of positive (negative) spatial correlation on metapopulation persistence. These models provide a framework for estimating the effectiveness of management strat egies and developing spatially-explicit guidelines for recovery of threatened wild salmonid stocks. BJURLIN, C.

Such is the case for the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), recently listed as a federally threatened species. From 1997 1999 we used radiographic techniques to determine prenatal egg production of a western Mojave population of the desert tortoise. Our findings cor roborated past research: Total egg production (F1 21 = 4.68; P &lt; 0.05) and size of the first clutch (F1 21 = 9.12; P &lt; 0.01) increased with female body size. However, our data did not support a previous finding of positive cor relation between female size and egg size. The resolution of this inconsis tency is not trivial, since larger eggs produced larger hatchlings (F3 12 = 81.009; P &lt; 0.001) with potentially greater resources to survive periods of scarce desert plant production. Interestingly, incubation condition was as influential on hatchling morphometrics as variation in egg dimension. Eggs incubating during a wet year, when soil moisture was high, produced much heavier hatchlings than same-sized eggs incubating during a dry year. In summary, protection of larger female tortoises will yield more offspring, but will not necessarily insure greater investment in individual eggs. Abi otic factors, such as temperature and soil moisture of the nest chamber, may play a greater role in desert tortoise hatchling morphometrics than has been previously reported. Future work on size related survival of tortoise young is needed. BLACK, A. and M. R. COOPER. Eastern Washington University, Cheney 99004, WA, USA. The potamoplankton conundrum: Searching for reg ulatory factors in an advective reservoir. Crustacean zooplankton dynamics and production were investigated over the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons in the Lake Roosevelt reservoir of the Columbia River (north-central Washington State). Use of ten-thousand liter nitex enclosures allowed us to corral ambient zooplankters and estimate demographic and productivity statistics over a 96 hour interval without the immigration and emmigration complications of the advective reservoir en vironment. Replicated production estimates were conducted weekly at mul tiple locations in the reservoir. The Lake Roosevelt reservoir has a re markably low residence time (mean = 40 days) making it more like a large river than a lake. Seasonal flucuations in water flow, water levels, and turbidity were dramatic. Physical conditions during the spring and early summer suggest the reservoir is a large river. Typical taxa include cyclo poid copepods and the small bodied Bosmina. Late summer and autumn conditions resemble those of a large lake. Eventually, crustacean zooplank ton taxa shift to successively larger bodied limnetic species (Daphnia schodleri and Leptodiaptomus ashlandi). While most species abundances were increasing, water residence time (WRT), temperature, and turbidity 56 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="18">appear to regulate production. Temperature and WRT were positively cor related with production (measured as change in biomass or population growth rate). Turbidity was negatively correlated with the productivity of some taxa (D. schodleri and L. ashlandi). Alternatively, while species abun dances were declining, production showed a positive correlation with chlo rophyll densities. Other than this mild suggestion that reservoir zooplank ton experienced food limitation, little evidence of important regulatory spe cies interactions was detected. BLAIR, S. D. and G. A. FOX. University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5150. Causes of spatial pattern in post-fire pine recruitment. Fire-frequency and competition both affect the dispersion of pine seedlings. We have studied patterns in the spatial dispersion and age/stage structure of Pinus palustris and P. elliottii growing in replicated experimental plots that, over a 20-yr period, have been burned every 1, 2, 5, or 7 yrs, or never burned. Average juvenile pine densities are much reduced as burn fre quency increases. Two factors contribute to the reduction in juvenile pine densities: less frequent (hotter) fires (a) cause larger open patches and there fore longer dispersal distances, and (b) permit greater growth of shrubby Quercus competitors. We have used spatial patterns of juvenile pine dis persion in each burn plot to study the importance of both dispersal distance and oak competition. By statistically holding local oak density constant, we can estimate the effect of distance from seed source on pine recruitment. Similarly, by statistically holding distance from seed source constant, we can estimate the effect of local oak density on pine recruitment. Our anal yses show that the relative importance of these factors in governing pine recruitment depends on spatial scale: In fires of great extent, dispersal lim itation is important, but in fires of smaller extent, oak competition is the dominant factor. BLOOM, A. J. and D. R. SMART. University of California, Davis, CA 95616. Elevated carbon dioxide inhibits nitrate photoassimilation. We recently confirmed in short-term leaf gas exchange measurements and longer-term plant growth experiments that elevated CO2 inhibits nitrate photoassimilation. Shoot assimilatory quotient (AQ)-the ratio of CO2 as similated to 02 evolved during photosynthesis-serves as a non-destructive measure of shoot photoassimilation. In wheat plants grown at 360 ppm CO2 and measured at lower CO2 concentrations, the AQ decreased mark edly when the nitrogen source was shifted from ammonium to nitrate, in dicating that the leaves were photoassimilating nitrate. Wheat grown at 360 ppm or 700 ppm CO2 and measured at higher CO2 concentrations, exhibited little change in AQ under the two nitrogen sources, indicating diminished nitrate photoassimilation. Wheat plants, grown for two weeks in environ mental chambers controlled at 360 or 700 ppm CO2, received nutrient so lutions containing either nitrate or ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. Nitrogen source had little effect on root parameters or on shoot growth and leaf organic N content in the plants grown at 360 ppm. In the plants grown at 700 ppm, however, shoot growth and leaf organic N content were dra matically less under nitrate nutrition. Were CO2 inhibition of nitrate pho toassimilation common among plants, it would offer a mechanistic expla nation for several other unresolved phenomenon including (a) plant accli mation to C02, (b) CO2 inhibition of respiration, (c) the localization of nitrate assimilation in the mesophyll of C4 species, and (d) the central role of nitrogen availability in determining ecosystem response to CO2 enrich ment. Moreover, it suggests that rising CO2 levels will have yet unforeseen effects upon nitrogen cycling in natural and managed ecosystems because unassimilated nitrate may leach into groundwater or increase nitrogen trace gas emissions.

Highway im pacts on animal populations and a way to reduce mortality and frag mentation. Roads and highways are a cause of mortality for many animals and may affect population viability by fragmenting populations. We investigated the effect highway traffic has on vertebrate populations in the Mojave Desert in California in two ways. We counted the number of vertebrate carcasses along 28.8 km of unfenced high-ways. We sampled for signs of desert tortoises (Gopherus agassizii) a threatened species, at different distances from the highway edge. We evaluated the effectiveness of a specially designed barrier fence at reducing mortality along a 24-km long section of highway. We investigated how tortoises used habitat near the highway edge to determine if they increased their use of habitat near the highway follow ing construction of the fence. Finally, using state-of-the-art technology, we monitored tortoise use of metal culverts to cross beneath the highway. We found the remains of 1078 vertebrates (8 species), including 37 desert tor toises, along two unfenced, paved highways. This level of mortality has probably resulted in a significant reduction in the density of one species, the desert tortoise, within 0.8 km or more of the highway. We found 93% fewer vertebrate carcasses and 88% fewer tortoise remains along 24 km of fenced highway compared with 24 km of unfenced highway. There was little significant change in the distribution of tortoises during the eight years following fence construction. Finally, tortoises occasionally used culverts to cross beneath the highway. Barrier fences are effective at reducing high way mortality in Mojave Desert vertebrates and culverts may help to reduce the fragmenting effect of fenced highways. BOEKEN, B. and M. SHACHAK. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel 84990. Facilitation of dominant by subordinate species in her baceous desert plant communities. We studied the role of local seed production and seed rain in determining plant density, biomass and species richness of annual plant communities by selective and total vegetation removal in small-scale inter-shrub patches of a semi-arid shrubland. In one field experiment the entire annual vege tation was removed from eight Im x Im plots for 6 years (1993-98). In another only the most dominant species, the annual grass Stipa capensis, was removed from ten 60 cm x 60 cm plots for 3 years (1996-98). All plants were identified and counted in spring of each year. Vegetation re moval caused a decrease in plant density and biomass, due to the decline of the two dominant annual grass species S.capensis and Bromus fascicu latus. Mean densities of other species and species number were not af fected. Selective S. capensis removal had no effect on density or species number, nor on its own density. Vegetation removal frequency did not affect other species either, but caused progressively lower densities and biomass of the two dominants. We conclude that in spite of removal of local seed production, seeds of the dominant and the subordinate species arrive, but that those of S.capensis can only establish in the presence of the subordinates. The facilitation overcomes the inability of S. capensis seeds to penetrate into the dense soil crust if there are no obstacles pro viding leverage. BOGGS, C. L. 1,2 and D. W.

Weather-driven resource availability controls butterfly population dy namics. Insects are often said to show density independent population regulation, with weather as a controlling factor. Weather is assumed to act directly on population numbers through mortality. For the butterfly Speyeria mormon ia, however, previous work showed that fecundity is directly proportional to female nectar intake, and nectar is likely limited in the field. Further, flower number of the primary nectar plants, Erigeron spp., is affected by exposure to early season frosts in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Frost damage is more likely to occur when snow melts early. We therefore hy pothesized that weather regulates butterfly population density through ef fects on the nectar plants. To test the hypothesis, we estimated butterfly density using mark-release-recapture from 1980 to 1982 and 1985 to 1991. Butterfly population growth was measured by r(t) = ln(N(t+1)/N(t)). Den sity varied from 20 to 4575 males/ha. We censused Erigeron peak flower number in permanent plots in order to estimate flower availability, flowers/ N(t). We combined July rainfall and flowers/N(t) to estimate nectar avail ability, since total nectar depends on soil moisture and flowers. As done earlier for plants, snow depth on April 30 was used to test susceptibility of larvae to early season frosts. Snow depth in year t+1 did not affect r(t); the butterfly larvae themselves do not face increased mortality from early season frosts when the snow melts early. Population growth was high when our measure of nectar was high, but flowers were scarce (after partitioning Oral Presentation Abstracts 57</page><page sequence="19">out joint effects of butterfly density). This suggests that growth rate is enhanced by high nectar availability, requiring little resource expenditure (flight among flowers) or risk of predation to obtain that nectar. While weather controls population growth for this butterfly, it does so indirectly through allocation mechanisms in response to weather-driven changes in the butterfly's resource base. BOHENSKY, E. L., T L. BENNING and D. S. SAAH. University of Cal ifornia, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. Remote sensing of riparian corri dors in the savanna landscape of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The savanna landscape of the Kruger National Park, South Africa is a highly heterogeneous system that is increasingly affected by expanding human populations and shifting patterns of land use. Boundaries in this landscape that define its spatial and temporal heterogeneity are of particular ecological interest, and riparian corridors-representing "hotspots" of ac tivity at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic systems-are perhaps the most obvious expression of boundaries in savanna regions. Remote sensing has proven useful in assessments of riparian zone dynamics as the spectral information afforded by satellite imagery can facilitate the detection and characterization of boundaries that fluctuate between seasons and years. Classification of riparian corridors using conventional remote sensing tech niques presents a challenge, however, as rivers, streams, and associated features do not assume the spatial configurations common to more homo geneous landcover types such as forest, pasture, open water or urban areas. In this study, a neural network classifier that employs texture analysis, which accounts for spatial structure in landscape patterns, provided an ad vantage. We compared the accuracy of classification algorithms developed for two regions of the Kruger National Park. Using Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery of the northern plains region along the Shingwedzi River and the southern region along the Sabie River, we examined the structure and spa tial extent of riparian corridors. For these regions, we were able to classify between four and eight community types. We found that the average ac curacy achieved with a neural network classifier (91%) was significantly higher than that obtained with a traditional maximum likelihood classifier (78%). This improvement in classification accuracy demonstrates the suit ability of a neural network approach for this analysis, and enables a better understanding of the structure and spatial extent of the riparian systems within the Kruger National Park's savanna landscape. BOHLEN, P. J. Archbold Biological Station, Lake Placid, FL 33852, USA. Nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in relation to grazing and land use in subtropical rangelands. The effects of livestock grazing on nutrient cycling are not well understood. I examined the influence of cattle stocking density in two different pasture types on nitrogen (N) mineralization, inorganic N pools and phosphorus (P) availability to assess the influence of grazing and grazing land use on the cycling of N and P in subtropical rangelands of central Florida. I mea sured in situ N mineralization and assessed P availability with ion-exchange resin sheets in sixteen experimental pastures, eight each in improved pas tures (24 ha) and semi-native range (38 ha) with replicates of four different stocking densities of beef cattle (0, 15, 20, 35 cow-calf-pairs per pasture). Average inorganic N content was 1.5-fold greater in the improved than in semi-native pastures. Average N mineralization from March through July, 1999, was 28 kg ha-' in improved and 22 kg ha-' in the semi-native pastures. Average resin extractable P was 3.8-fold greater in improved than in semi native pastures, probably due to long-term differences in P fertilizer history. Nitrogen mineralization rates were significantly lower in the high stocking density treatment than in the control and middle stocking density treatments in both improved and semi-native pastures. The effects of cattle grazing on N mineralization may have been due to shifts in allocation of below ground production in response to grazing. BOHRER, G., D. WARD and V. KAGAN-ZUR. Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel. Evidence of host preferences in natural com munities of YAM fungi from the Kalahari desert. Endomycorrhizal fungi (VAM) include some of the most ,.bundant root symbiont species. There are about 200 species of yAM, found in every habitat and associated with many plant species. The wide distribution of single species in so many habitats and hosts created the notion that VAM fungi are generalists in their host and habitat choices. However, there is an increasing amount of evidence that VAM fungi show habitat and host pref erences. Solving the question of VAM specificity is essential for under standing the ecological role of VAM in natural habitats and for implemen tation of VAM in agriculture, restoration and forestation. In a fully factorial experimental design, we planted seedlings of an important host- the indig enous fruit tree, Vangueria infausta, from 7 halfsib families. The treatments were soils of 3 natural sites and the 3 fungal communities collected in the same sites + a sterile control. Survival rate, phosphorus concentration, shoot and root length and mass were measured. All size variables were positively correlated with shoot dry mass. Seedlings grown in the sterile treatment were significantly smaller and with lower survival. There were no significant differences among soil treatments. Percentage of mycorrhizal inoculation in the roots was positively correlated with dry mass of both shoots and the roots. There was a halfsib family by fungal treatment in teraction among seedlings treated with VAM, suggesting that VAM fungi have host preferences. BOLSTAD, P. V. and P. B. REICH. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Acclimation in respiration in white oak (Quercus Alba). We report on two experiments that reveal acclimation in leaf respiration for Quercus alba (L.). In the first experiment seedlings from three geo graphic sources along a large climate gradient were grown in each of four controlled-environment chambers. Temperatures were set to a high tem perature (26-34 oC) and a low temperatutre regime (16-24 oC) in each of two chambers. Light and temperature varied in a four-step diurnal pattern. Respiration was measured at a fixed temperature (24 oC) every third day for approximately two weeks, and respiration was measured at 12, 18, 24, and 30 oC at the end of the two-week interval. Chambers were then switched to the opposite temperature regime, cool to warm, and warm to cool, for the subsequent two-week period. In the second experiment we grew seedlings from three geographic sources in each of three replicate controlled environment chambers. All settings were identical in the cham bers except for temperature. Chambers were set to a warm treatment (24 26 OC) or a cool treatment (14-16 oC). Leaf respiration was measured every two days at a fixed temperature (24 OC) for three leaves from each source in each chamber. Temperature regimes were switched after four days in each chamber (cool to warm, and warm to cool). Chambers were cycled from cool to warm treatments every six days for a 30 day period. Respi ration at the fixed temperature (24 oC) was higher for plants in a cool treatment when compared to plants in a warm treatment. Leaf respiration also exhibited very rapid acclimation to growth temperature. Respiration rates measured in the first experiment increased significantly during the two-week cool treatment. These rates reverted to lower levels when the plants were returned to the warm treatment for two weeks. Most of the acclimation was rapid, as within two days, plants appeared to have com pleted most of the shift in respiration to the new temperature regime. Res piration acclimation appears to be reversible, in that observed respiration rates at a fixed temperature decreased and increased through many warm and cool treatment cycles. BONINE, K. M.,' K. C.

Ecological relationships of Scylla serrata in the Federated States of Micronesia: Modeling strategies for mangrove resource manage ment. Mangrove crabs (Scylla serrata) comprise an important local fishery in the Federated States of Micronesia. On the easternmost island of Kosrae, ap proximately 40% of households collect crabs worth an estimated $500,000 per year. Population growth and decreased employment subsidies have placed more pressure on subsistence activities on the island, and as a result mangrove crabs are under threat from increased harvesting rates and man grove degradation. We have developed a mangrove resource use model integrating ecological and economic factors to evaluate potential manage ment policies. Using belt transects in the mangrove forests on Kosrae, we obtained baseline data on crab density, distribution, and habitat require ments. We found significantly higher crab burrow density (p&lt;O.O5) in in 58 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="20">terior (0.39/1Om2) and riverine (0.50/1lOm2) zones than in the fringe zone (0.00/10Om2), and we estimate a range of 45,000-135,000 crabs for the mangrove area of Kosrae. We also conducted household interviews on Kos rae to obtain demographic and resource use information to estimate current harvest rates and economic drivers of resource consumption. Survey results indicate an annual harvest rate of 97,000 crabs, with relatively more har vesting by unemployed subsistence households. A logistic growth model incorporating harvesting, mangrove area, and upper estimates for crab den sity indicates that a doubling of current harvest rates might push crab pop ulations on Kosrae to the edge of sustainability. A natural human popula tion growth rate of over 2% and continued decline in real incomes on Kosrae may necessitate active management measures such as harvesting size limits, harvest-free mangrove reserves, and export restrictions. BONSALL, M. and M. HASSELL. Imperial College, University of Lon don, United Kingdom. Apparent competition in heterogeneous environ ments. Prey that exists exclusively on different resources can compete in an in direct manner if they share common natural enemies. This is colloquially known as apparent competition. The role of apparent competition in ho mogenous (uniform) environments is well known and often leads to the exclusion or dramatic reduction in abundance of one of the prey species. Here, we explore the effects of apparent competition in heterogeneous en vironments. By considering a stylised interaction between two hosts and a polyphagous parasitoid, we demonstrate, theoretically, how environmental heterogeneity can influence coexistence. In particular, we highlight (1) how the underlying spatial distribution of hosts is paramount in influencing co existence, (2) the role of temporal switching effects on coexistence and (3) the effects of spatial aggregative behaviours. We emphasis the different sources of variation that are prevalent in promoting coexistence in host parasitoid assemblages where indirect interactions occur. BOORSE, D. F, T WOLFE and LINDSAY. Gordon College, Wenham MA 10984 USA. Water lily (Nymphaea sp.) as a structuring agent of mi crohabitats in a shallow marsh. Water quality patchiness may provide environmental heterogeneity and in crease biodiversity in shallow marshes. We tested the hypothesis that large sections of water lily (Nymphaea sp.), including growing shoots and roots and associated clumps of detritus, acted as ecosystem engineers by deter mining the heterogeneity of water temperature and dissolved oxygen. Het erogeneity was defined as the mean of the absolute values of the differences between each measurement and its surrounding neighbors in a grid. After a reference measure of heterogenity was taken, water lily clumps were removed from one portion of a shallow marsh (removed) and moved to another (added). A third, unchanged area was used as a control. We pre dicted that mean difference between adjacent points would decrease as the habitat became more homogenous in the perturbed areas. After the pertur bation, environmental heterogeneity decreased on the bottom in the re moved portion than the control and added areas and increasedat the surface in the added area. Dissolved oxygen heterogeneity decreased at the water surface in control and removed areas and increased in sections with added vegetation while pattern was reversed on the marsh bottom. Vegetation pattern may affect microhabitat distribution indirectly through differences in water quality. An interaction between clumps of vegetation and the sub strate may account for differences between the bottom and surface effects. BORDA-DE-AGUA, L.,' S. P. HUBBELL2 and M. K.

The general relationship between species-area curves, diversity indices and species abundance distributions: A multifractal analysis. Although fractals have for long been applied in ecology, multifractals have, in contrast, received little attention. In this work we explore the application of the multifractal formalism to the power law form of the species-area relationship. The generalization of the power law species-area relationship by multifractal methods is potentially far reaching: it ties species-area the ory to a number of indices used widely to quantify diversity, generates a number of new hypotheses about patterns of biodiversity for further inves tigation, and it develops new tools with utility in addressing practical is sues, such as, conservation. While fractal sets are described in terms of a single number (the fractal dimension), multifractals require an infinite num ber of "dimensions", usually called a spectrum. The characterization of multifractals can be obtained by two different approaches: the method of moments and the method of histograms. The former deals with the statis tical moments of the species abundance distribution, but can only be ap plied when the moments exhibit power law scaling with area. The latter method is of more general application and uses histograms of the species abundance distribution obtained at different areas. The method of moments shows that the power law form of the species area relationship, and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species relative abundance and area through the moments of the species abundance distribution. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. In addition, the method of moments implies relationships between a species range and its relative abundance. The method of histograms highlights the dependence of the shape of the species relative abundance distribution on area. The application of these methods is illustrated with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50 ha plot in the Barro Colorado Island, Pan ama. Results from the method of moments show that some moments of the species abundance distribution have power law scaling with the area. Results from the method of histograms show that after appropriate trans formation the species abundance distributions obtained at different areas converge to a single curve: the multifractal spectrum. BORER, E. T. University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA. Larval competition between two parasitoids in the California red scale system: Implications for coexistence and biological control. A reanalysis of a published larval competition experiment between two parasitoids of California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) suggests that the common entomological assumption that ectoparasitoids are intrinsically su perior competitors against endoparasitoids may not always hold. An en doparasitoid in this system (Encarsia perniciosi) appears to gain compet itive ability with increasing larval age. Unfortunately the published data cover only the first 105 degree-days of Encarsia development, rather than the approximately 375 degree-days required to complete larval develop ment. I performed a lab experiment to investigate the outcome of the com petitive interaction between Aphytis melinus (ectoparasitoid) and Encarsia throughout the endoparasitoid's larval development. When Encarsia para sitized first instar hosts, Aphytis had a decreased probability of competitive success with increasing Encarsia larval development time. However, in second instar hosts, Aphytis has a decreasing probability of emergence through time, regardless of Encarsia presence; Aphytis lost only a slight numerical advantage in hosts containing Encarsia, regardless of the en doparasitoid's larval age. In contrast, in both first and second instar hosts, as Encarsia larvae aged, they steadily increased their probability for suc cess against their ectoparasitoid competitor. These results suggest a possible mechanism for competitive coexistence among two species with strongly overlapping resource requirements and have implications for biological control.

Using a knowledge-based system for selec tion of regional conservation networks as a communication tool. The recent emphasis on conservation-area networks that are representative of conservation targets in large regions requires the integration of two seemingly contradictory aspects of conservation planning. First, the process of implementing such a network necessitates integrating large amounts of data in complex analyses to address three steps: (1) Delineating ecologi cally meaningful land units from which conservation areas are selected, (2) determining the suitability of the land units for conservation, and (3) se lecting those that are most suitable. Second, the successful implementation of regional conservation networks requires the involvement of multiple partners, including the general public. Therefore, methods to prioritize and select areas for conservation should be explicit, repeatable, flexible, and easily visualized to facilitate the use of scientific data by decision-makers and to communicate the consequences of conservation decisions to both Oral Presentation Abstracts 59</page><page sequence="21">decision-makers and the general public. For these reasons, we have devel oped a model contained in a knowledge-based system (KBS) for determin ing land-unit suitability for conservation. We present results obtained from running the model in the 58 million-hectare interior Columbia River basin (ICRB). The KBS operates within a GIS-integrated application framework, which links the KBS with 12 spatial databases, produces output suitability maps, and provides data for optimization procedures to select land units based on their suitability. The model provides the ability to synthesize data available for the ICRB as a set of hierarchically-arranged fuzzy-logic net works, which characterize logical relationships among land-unit attributes contributing to conservation suitability. The structure of the model, as an explicit expression of our current understanding of ecological relationships, is readily communicated and easily changed to accommodate comments and reviews. The strengths of the framework are its ability to integrate current knowledge and available data concerning a conservation target of interest in an explicit and flexible manner, as well as its ability to provide visualization of the spatial implications of decisions as a platform for dis cussion with land managers and planners.

Modeling the ecological consequences of an alternative manage ment regime for northern hardwoods. Managing-for-old-growth (MOG) characteristics has been proposed to meet ecosystem management objectives. Using the NORTHWDS model, we evaluated MOG as applied to second- growth, hardwood-dominated, even aged stands of the Ottawa National Forest (Michigan, USA). A synthetic 225 ha stand was assembled from 50-70 yr old 0.09 hectare sugar maple dominated stand elements and simulated (10 replicates per scenario) for 250 yr. Two traditional forest management regimes, clearcutting (CC) and uneven-aged selection (UA), were compared to MOG and an unmanaged control. Eight scenarios were considered: four harvest treatments (unman aged, MOG, UA, and CC) at two deer browsing levels (high and low). MOG aboveground live tree biomass patterns were comparable to unman aged old-growth, with both treatment types reaching or exceeding the - 250 Mg/ha threshold noted for similar old-growth northern hardwood stands. Long-term average tree species richness (- 7.0) for MOG and UA treatments closely matched the unmanaged control, while clearcutting pro duced significantly higher richness (- 7.5-8.0, depending on deer browsing intensity). The MOG scenario averaged 12-15 Mg/ha of coarse woody debris (CWD) biomass, which, while lower than the 15-24 Mg/ha average of unharvested conditions, exceeded the CWD stocks of both the UA and CC scenarios (7-11 Mg/ha and 3-7 Mg/ha, respectively). With the excep tion of tree species richness in clearcut scenarios, white-tailed deer brows ing only minorly impacted the reported parameters. Although dominated by sugar maple, MOG stand structure and composition can emulate old growth in some respects. BRASWELL, B. H.,12 E. A. HOLLAND13 and J. C.

Eastern US forests are currently receiving over 1.2 Tg per year of reactive N deposition in the form of NOy and NHx, according to our analysis of the available data from the National Acid Deposition Program and the National Dry Deposition Network. About two-thirds of this flux is into northeastern forests, but we estimate that both regions have experienced a substantial increase over the last 100 years, by about 4.5 times. Ambient carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have also increased by over 30% in the same period. It is well known that both these factors can have pro found and potentially interactive effects on terrestrial fluxes of C and N, but little is known about how the pools of organic C and N in living and dead forest material have changed. For example, both can lead to enhanced carbon uptake, but both provoke ecosystem feedbacks that may place a limit on this enhancement. We used the terrestrial biogeochemistry model (Century) to explore the cumulative and current effects of nitrogen depo sition and atmospheric C02 increases. Constructing a C and N budget for each 0.5x0.5 degree grid cell in the the study region allows us to explore controls and uncertainty in various components of these budgets. The spa tially-explicit budgets also can be compared directly with results from chemistry/transport modeling and direct atmospheric observations. In order to develop a predictive understanding of terrestrial biogeochemistry, in cluding the question of sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, we must be able to identify how anthropogenic C and N has been partitioned among various ecosystem components. Our study provides a constraint on this problem based on a synthesis of modeling and spatial data analysis. BRAUN, D. M.,1 B. RUNCHENG,2 D. C. SHAW1 and M.

Herbivory was monitored from bud break in May to leaf drop in October, 1999, by weekly assessment of the area lost on tagged leaves and collections of larvae for species identification. The adjusted percentage herbivory (based on the weekly leaf area) produced levels of 1% to 3% per week in May, after which herbivory was approximately 0.5% per week. Total herbivory was 9.4% of leaf area, based on fully expanded leaf outline. The lepidopteran herbivore guild consisted of four groups which occurred sequentially, with little overlap: the first consisted solely of Operophtera bruceata (Geometridae); the sec ond group consisted of two species, Choristoneura rosaceana and an Ar chips sp (Tortricidae); the third group consisted of Lambdina fiscellaria fiscellaria and Itame plumosata (Geometridae); and the fourth group con sisted of microlepidopterans (Gelichiidae). In addition, 3 or fewer individ uals of approximately 13 other species were collected. The guild structure has several implications: First, the sequential nature of appearance of these groups may represent adaptations to increasing levels of tannins and leaf toughness over the course of the season; second, the early-season peak in larval abundance may represent a significant component of the high-quality food available to neotropical migrant birds as well as local birds at a critical time in their life histories, and third, because the forest studied typically has very low levels of conifer herbivory, &lt; 1%, this level of herbivory for its dominant understory shrub has implications for nutrient cycling, primary production, and food webs that are not obvious based on conifer herbivory alone.

We compared beaver herbivory along 10 km alluvial reaches of the free flowing Yampa River (YR) and regulated Green River (GR) in NW Col orado. Flow regimes and riparian ecosystems were similar along the 6th order reaches prior to dam closure in 1962, and we assumed that beaver densities were also similar. For cottonwood, Populus deltoides, flow reg ulation has caused a decrease in area suitable for regeneration: number of patches with saplings (GR = 3, YR = 20), total area of patches (GR = 27,000 m2, YR = 104,500 m2), and average density (GR = 0.22 stems/ m2, YR = 1.01 stems/M2). For willow, Salix exigua, flow regulation has caused a shift in distribution from the floodplain to islands. The amount of willow is similar on each river: number of patches (CR = 40, YR = 29), total area of patches (CR = 107,400 in2, YR = 119,500 in2), and density per patch (CR = 29.0 stems/in2, YR = 36.7 stems/in2). Vegetation changes on the Green River have led to increased effects of beaver herbivory: Sea sonal survival (5) of cottonwood saplings (CR:S = 0.87, YR:S = 0.97), and the percent of willow cut per patch (CR = 36%, YR = 28%). We suggest regulation has magnified beaver's impact on cottonwood through interrelated effects on plant spatial distribution, cottonwood abundance and the promotion of higher beaver density. 60 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="22">BREITBURG, D.

Understanding how the complexity of food webs affects responses of aquat ic systems is critical to both our basic understanding of the ecology of these systems and to determining the complexity of experimental food webs necessary to generate sound information for management decisions. As part of the COASTES program we have been conducting a series of mesocosm, large field enclosure, and small-scale laboratory experiments to examine how trophic complexity affects the response of a representative coastal system, the Patuxent River, to nutrient enrichment and trace elements. Our results indicate that the effect of increasing food chain length can be quite different than the effect of increasing the number of species that feed at the same trophic level. Thus the geometry of food webs as well as the diversity of species within an assemblage is important. For example, in creasing food chain length increased the magnitude and variability of the response of phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, and heterotrophic nannofla gellates to nutrient additions, while increasing the number and kinds of taxa feeding on the microbial food web (i.e., increasing the complexity of the food web) dampened the absolute and proportional responses. The ef fect of food web complexity on responses to stressors was independent of the strength of the direct effects of consumers on prey. In addition, increas ing both food chain length and food web complexity increased the temporal stability of the system. A food web simulation model was used to test alternate mechanisms that could explain the pattern we have seen, i.e., maximum response to stressors in long, relatively simple food webs and dampening of responses in more complex webs. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and include increased numbers of pathways in complex food webs, differences in total consumption with different numbers of graz ers, and the dominance of species-specific characteristics of grazers.

Linking patch-scale heterogeneity to hillslope runoff in semaird ecosystems. Runoff and erosion at hillslope scales is a driver for many environmental problems in semiarid environments. Redistribution of runoff also provides a means of increasing the amount of water available to plants by concen trating the resource at patch scales. Lacking is an understanding of the relationships between patch-scale cover and hillslope runoff. We used a spatially explicit hyrdological model, SPLASH, to evaluate relationships between patch heterogeneity and hillslope-scale runoff by varying the pro portions of the vegetation patch types: canopy patches beneath trees, in tercanopy patches with bare cover, and intercanopy patches with herba ceous cover. Our objectives were to estimate runoff and runon for each patch type as a function of changing vegetation cover, to evaluate how optimum runon to herbaceous patches depends on the proportion of bare patches, and to assess the sensitivity of hillslope runoff to changes in cover. We parameterized SPLASH for the Mesita del Buey Pinyon-Juniper Wood land Site at Los Alamos, NM using grid cells of 1 m by lm over and area of roughly 100 m by 150 m. We initially evaluated these relationships for an intense 1 cm convective storm. Bare patches generated net runoff where as canopy and herbaceous patches were sources for capturing runon. Her baceous patches received optimum runon at intermediate values of cover for bare patches. Hillslope runoff was not sensitive to initial reductions in % bare cover, but then increased with increasing % bare cover. These sim ulation results are consistent with observations of runoff at patch and hil lslope scales and demonstrate how patch patterns in cover are integrated with hillslope runoff. The results have important implications for assessing how changes in vegetation can trigger a transition from low to high erosion rates. BRET-HARTE, M., F. CHAPINIII, J. R. WHORLEY, B. A. GARCIA and V. SACRE. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA. Species and functional types affect ecosystem response to fertilization in arctic tun dra. Human activites increasingly affect earth's environment and ecosystems not only through direct impacts on climate and element cycling, but also by mediating introductions and extinctions of species. Species differ in traits that affect the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, but the extent to which species affect ecosystem functioning and the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem response to perturbation is still largely unknown. We conducted an experiment in arctic tundra to measure the effects of removing plant species and functional groups of plant species, defined in two different ways, on ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling in the pres ence and absence of fertilization. Our objective was to understand to what extent species can substitute for each other in ecosystem functioning and response to perturbation. We measured biomass non-destructively using a point-intercept method initially in 1997 and again in 1999. We found that in 1999, 1) fertilization stimulated the growth of most vascular species and led to declines in most non-vascular species in the absence of species re movals, 2) fertilization when key species were removed led to increases in some species in the same functional type (e.g., Rubus chamaemorus in creased by 200% when fertilized in the absence of Betula nana, as com pared to a slight decline when Betula was present), 3) removal of a single functional type, mosses, led to an increase in growth of all vascular plants without additional fertilization, and 4) removal of mosses plus the two most common evergreen and deciduous shrubs without fertilization led to an increase in graminoid biomass similar that seen with fertilization with no species removals. These results suggest that nitrogen is being redistributed among the remaining species and that compensatory growth of the re maining species is occurring. It remains to be seen whether carbon storage will be fully compensated in the removal treatments, as short-term and long-term responses to fertilization in tundra are quite different. BRIGGS, C. J. and J. LATTO. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U. S. A. The influence of seasonality on parasitoid coexistence and host abundance. Many insects support a rich fauna of parasitoids and predators and com petition between these natural enemies is likely to be strong. Here we investigate how seasonality in natural enemy attack influences (a) the po tential for coexistence of multiple natural enemy species and (b) the com bined impact of these enemies on host abundance. Field experiments have been carried out in Berkeley, California, using a native gall forming midge, Rhopalomyia californica, and its suite of parasitoids and predators. Al though the midge has continuous, overlapping, generations there is consid erable seasonality within the system. Midge development time can be as short as 40 days in the field but is strongly influenced by the highly variable growth rate of its host plant, Baccharis pilularis. Predation on the egg and early larval stages of the midge was a much higher mortality source on this species than previously appreciated and varied greatly throughout the year. Galls formed at all times of year, but the number of galls formed successfully per female varied seasonally. Development rate of the midge also varied seasonally, as did the relative parasitism of the egg and larval stages which, combined, were as high as 90% of the available hosts. These findings will be combined into a seasonal stage structured model to illus trate how only certain forms of seasonality can promote natural enemy coexistence. BRITTON-SIMMONS, K. H.

Exotic species impact native ecosystems at all levels and are a leading threat to biodiversity. The Japanese seaweed, Sargassum muticum, was in troduced to the northwest coast of North America in the 1940's and sub sequently expanded its range south as far as Baja California. Many of the reports of its impacts on native flora and fauna in the northeast Pacific are anecdotal or based on indirect evidence. In an ongoing study, I am ex ploring the impacts of Sargassum on native, subtidal seaweed communities in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. The subtidal algal community in this region is diverse and structurally complex, consisting of a canopy of brown algal species and an understory of red algal species. Field ex periments suggest that Sargassum reduces the density and species richness of native canopy seaweeds and reduces the density, but not richness, of understory seaweeds. These effects are variable in space and time and may be influenced by physical characteristics of the habitat. Furthermore, Sar gassum grows taller than all but one native canopy species and experiments Oral Presentation Abstracts 61</page><page sequence="23">suggest that light attenuation by Sargassum is an important mechanism underlying the observed impacts. BROCKWAY, D. G. USDA Forest Service, Auburn, AL 36849, USA. Re storing fire as an ecological process in shortgrass prairie ecosystems. Prior to Anglo-European settlement, fire was a major ecological process influencing the structure, composition and productivity of shortgrass prairie ecosystems on the Great Plains. However during the past 125 years, the frequency and extent of grassland fire has dramatically declined as a result of heavy grazing by large herds of domestic cattle and sheep which reduced the available levels of fine fuel and organized fire suppression efforts that succeeded in altering the natural fire regime. The greatly diminished role of recurrent fire in these ecosystems is thought to be responsible for eco logically adverse shifts in the composition, structure and diversity of these grasslands, leading specifically to the rise of ruderal species and invasion by less fire-tolerant species. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ecological effects of fire season and frequency on the shortgrass prairie and to determine the means by which prescribed fire can best be restored in this ecosystem to provide the greatest benefit for numerous resource values. Plant cover, diversity, biomass and nutrient status, litter cover and soil chemistry were measured prior to and following fire treatments on a buf falograss-blue grama shortgrass prairie in northeastern New Mexico. Dor mant-season fire was followed by increases in grass cover, forb cover, spe cies richness and concentrations of foliar P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn. Growing season fire produced declines in the cover of buffalograss, graminoids and forbs and increases in litter cover and levels of foliar P, K, Ca and Mn. Although no changes in soil chemistry were observed, both fire treatments caused decreases in herbaceous production, with standing biomass resulting from growing-season fire averaging about 600 kg/ha and dormant-season fire approximating 1200 kg/ha, compared with controls near 1800 kg/ha. The initial findings of this long-term experiment suggest that dormant season burning may be the preferable method for restoring fire in shortgrass prairie ecosystems where fire has been excluded for a prolonged time pe riod.

The effects of transient reductions in functional leaf area on stomatal conductance: Branch level experi ments on young and old trees. As trees age and increase in size, the resistance along the water transport path has been hypothesized to increase and potentially limit the ultimate size a tree can reach. Past research has demonstrated that branches are a source of significant resistance in the transport path. Architecturally, branches on old and young trees are also quite different and could pose different restrictions on the hydraulic pathway. In this study, we altered the amount of leaf area that was transpiring through bagging, and monitored the gas-exchange responses of the remaining functional foliage in young and old Douglas-fir at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility. Reductions in functional leaf area on a branch should increase leaf specific conductance to the remaining functional foliage. However, we found no increases in stomatal conductance in either young or old trees as a result of transient reductions in functional leaf area. The drop in water potential, mid-day stomatal closure and associated photosynthetic decline occurred at the same time and were of the same magnitude on both shaded and unshaded branches. This was true for both young and old trees even though specific conductivity was much lower in old-growth branches. Mid-day water potentials were slightly lower in old trees compared to young, but in both age groups about half the water potential drop along the transport pathway occurred below 1.3 m. These results indicate that conductance within a branch plays a small role in mid-day decline in stomatal conduc tance and that other parts of the overall pathway may be more critical. BROUGHTON, L. C. and K. L. GROSS. W.K. Kellogg Biological Station, MI 49060 USA. The role of plant species in the structure and function of soil microbial communities: An experimental evaluation. How important are plant species in influencing the structure and function of soil microbial communities? We attempted to answer this question by examining the structure and composition of soil microbial communities from six old fields at the Kellogg Biological Station in southwestern Mich igan that differed in plant species composition, productivity, and soil char acteristics. Aboveground productivity ranged from 188 to 592 g/m2 across sites, while plant species density ranged from 2 to 16 species/M2. We grew a common plant species, Andropogon gerardi, in each soil to determine if this influenced the composition and activity of the soil community. Plants were grown for 110 days in the greenhouse. We measured plant perfor mance in each soil type and also compared how soil characteristics (e.g. moisture, percent organic matter, nitrogen) and the activity and composition of the soil microbial community differed in the presence and absence of A. gerardi. We assessed the composition of the soil microbial community using Ecolog') and PLFA. Soils differed in fertility and this affected plant biomass and allocation patterns. In both the ? A. gerardi treatments, soils differed in microbial activity and PLFA patterns. The presence of A. ger ardi increased the mean, but decreased the variation, in microbial activity among soils. In addition, soils from + A. gerardi treatments differed in PLFA patterns from the no plant controls. This suggests that plant species composition can affect the composition and activity of the soil microbial community. BROWN, K. J.,I K. GRIFFIN,I W. SCHUSTER,2 D. TISSUE,3 M. TURN BULL4 and D.

Leaf area distribution and canopy clumping in an old-growth mixed-species podocarp New Zealand rainforest. Estimation of the quantity and spatial distribution of leaf area is an essential task for scaling leaf-level processes from to the canopy and stand levels. Direct measurements of leaf area in old-growth forests are extremely dif ficult, and destructive sampling is sometimes not an option. Optically based methods of LAI estimation are non-destructive, but should be used care fully. Many canopies have been shown to possess 'clumped' foliage, pos sibly resulting in underestimates of LAI if such clumping is not explicitly accounted for. Non-destructive methods using radiation interception and gap fraction theory were chosen to measure LAI in an old-growth mixed species podocarp New Zealand rainforest. The objectives of this research were: (1) To obtain estimates of LAI in the mixed-species podocarp stand near Okarito, Westland, NZ, using the Li-Cor LAI-2000, and (2) to estimate shoot-level and canopy-level clumping correction factors for shoots of rimu, Dacrydium cupressinum, the dominant tree at our study site. This study was part of a larger cooperative effort to characterize the forest struc ture, leaf-level gas exchange processes, and to model the stand net carbon flux at this site. LAI-2000 measurements were made at each point on a 5 m grid on a 50 x 50-m forest inventory plot, and corrected with above canopy LAI-2000 data. Using a 23-m canopy access tower, shoots were then sampled from various canopy depths from three large trees. Shoots were immediately analyzed for their mean silhouette-to-projected area ratio (SPAR-bar) using a rotating frame and high-resolution digital camera on a mount that allowed for imaging at precise angles. Projected leaf area, rather than total area, was used for this analysis due to the extremely complex shoot structure of rimu. SPAR-bar was then used for the calculation of the canopy clumping factor. The rimu canopy was extremely heterogeneous. Shoots varied in 'clumpiness', displaying a large degree of within-canopy morphological adaptation. Within-shoot clumping was greater in upper can opy shoots than those from the lower canopy. Results will be presented which demonstrate the impact of clumping correction factors on LAI-2000 estimates of LAI in a multi-layered old-growth podocarp forest. BROWN, J. S.,' B. P. KOTLER2 and A.

We modeled a foraging game between a forager and its predator when the forager's resource is pulsed. For gerbils inhabiting sand dunes in Israel, for example, seed abundance is highest at dusk and declines throughout the night. The early gerbil gets the seeds but the early gerbil attracts owls. At the ESS of the model, rodent and owl activity should peak at dusk and 62 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="24">decline throughout the night. The model predicts three phases of activity. In the first, all prey and all predators forage actively. During the second, a constant fraction of prey remain active while the activity of owls declines steadily. During this phase the capture rate of predators remains constant and the prey experience a constant ratio of risk to net energy return. During the third phase, resources become so depleted that all prey and predators remain inactive. The behavioral game stabilizes the predator-prey interac tion for two reasons: 1) The prey have a behavioral refuge, and 2) the predators, via the fear responses of the prey, negatively effect their ability to capture prey.

Mutualistic associations of branchiobdellids and their crayfish hosts: Evidence of a freshwater cleaning symbiosis. Branchiobdellid annelids are symbiotes on freshwater crustaceans. This re lationship has traditionally been considered commensal, though an appro priate analysis of the costs and benefits of association has never been per formed. We explored the hypothesis that the relationship between bran chiobdellids and host crayfish in the New River is mutualistic rather than commensal using growth/mortality experiments, laboratory feeding exper iments and field distributional surveys. Branchiobdellids significantly re duced mortality of the host crayfish Cambarus chasmodactylus during growth/mortality experiments, though no significant effects of branchiob dellids on host growth rates were observed. We hypothesized that potential host gill cleaning behavior exhibited by branchiobdellids could be the source of the observed reduction in mortality. To explore the mechanism behind this mutualism, we used fluorescent paint pigments to trace food items consumed by branchiobdellids and found that branchiobdellids will remove POM trapped in the gill chambers of host crayfish. Branchiobdel lids also preferentially inhabit sites on host crayfish which are proximate to the host gill chamber, facilitating potential gill cleaning behavior. This evidence suggests that the interaction between branchiobdellids and their crayfish hosts in the New River may represent a rare freshwater case of a cleaning symbiosis akin to those found commonly among coral reef or ganisms. BROWN, R. L. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3275 USA. Trends in community structure along the immigration-extinction gradient. Ecologists often invoke one of two contrasting groups of processes to ex plain the composition and structure of communities. One group includes density-dependent, extinction-driven processes, such as resource competi tion and assembly rules, which limit community membership to a particular subset of the available species pool that contains well-adapted, compatible, competitive species. The second group includes processes such as immi gration (especially propagule pressure) and disturbance (which reduces competitive intensity) that allow a broader subset of species to establish. I propose ordering communities along a gradient from those organized large ly by extinction processes to those organized largely by immigration as a means of understanding previously confusing patterns in the species di versity, compositional predictability, and invasibility of communities. Plant communities of southern Appalachian riparian zones span a broad range of disturbance and propagule pressure and, therefore, provide an ideal sys tem to illustrate the utility of ordering plant communities along an immi gration-extinction gradient. I determined species composition, richness and predictability across upland, scour bar, floodplain, and terrace positions. Species richness and exotic invasion is extremely high in floodplain and scour bar communities (immigration-driven communities). In terrace and upland communities (extinction-driven communities) there were 50% fewer species and substantially fewer plots with exotic plants. In addition, the vegetation of scour bars and floodplains is more unpredictable in species composition compared to terraces and uplands. The juxtaposition of high species richness, high frequency of exotic species, and lack of composi tional predictability found in floodplain and scour bar communities can be explained by the high rates propagule pressure provided by flood water, combined with periodic disturbances from flood events. We suggest that similar patterns in other plant communities can be understood when viewed in the context of the dominance of immigration and establishment pro cesses. BROWN, C. S.' and K. J.

Effects of straw mulch, nitrogen fertilizer and compost on establishment of California native perennial grasses. Increased understanding of the relative efficacy of cultural practices such as fertilization and mulch application will improve our ability to establish native perennial grasses in restoration and erosion control projects. There are potential trade-offs for many of these practices. For example, fertilizing may improve growth of seeded perennial grasses but increase growth of weeds rpore, which could result in increased competition for resources and poorer perennial grass growth. Applying straw mulch may improve peren nial grass seedling emergence, but weeds introduced in straw can nega tively affect perennial grasses. We studied the effects of different types of straw mulch, municipal green-waste compost and slow-release nitrogen fer tilizer on the establishment and growth of California native perennial grass es. The mixture of perennial grasses, California melic (Melica californica), purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra) and pine bluegrass (Poa secunda ssp. secunda), responded to interactions between nutrient availability, weeds and volunteers of the mulch species. The mixture of grasses exhibited the best performance, i.e. nutrient status (%N and C:N) and growth, with rice (Oriza sativa) mulch and the poorest performance with blue wildrye (Elymus glau cus) mulch. Performance with wheat (Triticum aestivum) mulch was inter mediate. Perennial grass success decreased with increasing abundance of weeds and volunteers of the mulch species, which competed with the pe rennial grasses for resources. Rice mulch had the lowest and blue wildrye mulch had the highest abundance of weeds and volunteers from straw, corresponding to the best and worst perennial grass performance, respec tively. The effect of weed competition was eliminated by the addition of nitrogen fertilizer. Decreased nutrient availability due to differences in de composition rates or allelopathic effects of the straws, or both, may have contributed to the effects we detected. The addition of compost benefited weeds, but not the perennial grasses overall, although the responses of individual species varied. In summary, perennial grass performance was best with rice straw, was improved by the addition of nitrogen fertilizer in the presence of weeds and was not greatly affected by the addition of compost.

Vertical N distribution and light interception as a mechanism for direct competition between sedges and grasses. A spatial and temporal transition from sedge dominated to grass dominated communities is characteristic of many wet graminoid meadows in the north-central US and south-central Canada. While the spatial distribution of the two plant groups is closely related to soil moisture, competition free trials show that moisture is not solely responsible for the transition. Field measurements of vertical biomass distribution in the dominant grass and sedge species are combined with an extensive light interception study to elucidate possible mechanisms for competition and exclusion between the two groups. At any one time the sedges Scirpus cyperinus, Carex lacustris and C. rostrata dominate the lower, wetter regions of the studied wetlands, while the grass Calamagrostis canadensis dominates the higher, drier re gions. A shift towards Calamagrostis may also occur if there is a tendency for the wetland as a whole to become drier over time, as is the case for meadows forming in place of abandoned, drained, beaver ponds. By pro ducing leaves at various heights on the stem, grasses like Calamagrostis are able to position more biomass in the mid-canopy than sedges, which produce leaves only at ground level. A Calamagrostis plant with 0.2 g of biomass between 0 and 10 cm above ground may have 0.4-0.5 g of bio mass between 50 and 60 cm above ground. Sedges invariably displayed decreasing biomass with height, a function of their structure. However the tendency to increased mid-canopy biomass in Calamagrostis was reduced in saturated conditions. Light penetration was minimal below mid-canopy in dense, typically wet stands. The ability of Calamagrostis to produce more light capturing biomass at mid-canopy level in drier conditions may be the mechanism driving the sedge to grass transition along moisture gradients in wet graminoid meadows.

Predation gradients in intertidal communities: The interac tive roles of habitat and elevation. Gradients of predation intensity may be generated by spatial variability in factors that regulate predator-prey interactions. We investigated whether gradients of blue crab predation on marsh periwinkle snails were evident in North Carolina Spartina salt marshes. Factors controlling predator access to prey in marshes include marsh elevation and vegetation height. Field surveys and modeling exercises generated three predictions. First, predation intensity should increase from high elevation portions of the marsh to the low marsh near tidal creeks and bays. Second, predation will be more intense in areas with short marsh grass (Spartina) and less intense where taller grass provides refuge for snails. Third, these predation gradients or dered by elevation and vegetation height may interact. Where marsh grass is short, the disparity between high marsh and low marsh in snail density, crab size, and predation rate should be negligible. Where grass is tall, however, predation intensity in the low marsh will be greater than in the high marsh. To test these predictions, we cut several experimental channels from low to high marsh through Spartina. Each channel was paired with an uncut reference transect, and we monitored abundances of crabs and predation rates on tagged snails. The experiment supported the hypothesis that vegetation height and marsh elevation both order gradients of predation intensity by blue crabs on snails. Support was evident, but equivocal, for the hypothesis that the gradients interact. This study emphasizes the indirect consequences of habitat modification, such as that imposed by feral horses that heavily graze Spartina marshes on several east coast barrier islands. BRUNA, E. M. University of California-Davis. Forest fragmentation and the population dynamics of an Amazonian herb. Heliconia acuminata is an understory herb found in both the rainforest fragments and the continuous forest reserves of Brazil's Biological Dynam ics of Forest Fragments Project. I marked and measured over 4000 indi viduals of H. acuminata in both fragments and forest and recorded their fecundity, growth, and survivorship over the course of two years. I then combined these demographic data with experimental results on seed ger mination and seedling survivorship into a six-stage matrix demographic model. This model was used to calculate population growth rate (lambda) in fragments and forests and predict short-term population dynamics. Flow ering and seed germination success were significantly lower in forest frag ments than continuous forest, while adult survivorship was high in all sites. In addition, growth rate lambda was less than one in all forest fragments and greater than one in five of six continuous forest sites. Although there is almost certainly year to year variation in lambda, these results suggest that long term reduction in reproduction and growth rates could lead to local extinction of H. acuminata from forest fragments.

Declines of native amphibian populations have been variously attributed to such causes as novel diseases, increased UV radiation, and habitat destruc tion. However, responses of amphibians to natural catastrophes have been little studied. Flooding in the Mississippi River basin in 1993 resulted in extensive inundation of adjacent natural areas, including known amphibian breeding sites. We surveyed a state nature preserve in southern Illinois for four species of salamanders (Ambystoma sp.) during 1999-2000. Compar ison of our data with those collected by another investigator at the same site in 1989 reveal a dramatic decline in abundance of these animals; whereas over 320 individuals of four different species were located in 1989, we captured only 26 individuals of three species in 1999. We also observed no embryos and only very few salamander larvae in breeding pools within the reserve. Individuals of one of the species (A. maculatum) were also significantly smaller in 1999 than in 1989. Anecdotal evidence provided by other investigators also suggest that salamander abundance has greatly declined in this area. Because this relatively pristine site is a state nature preserve in which no human activities are allowed, we feel the most likely cause of this decline was inundation by floodwaters in 1993.

The purpose of this study was to examine how the quality and spatial arrangement of such biologically-generated habitats effect the large-scale distribution and dynamics of species that inhabit them. The study system was the cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of intertidal forbs that is only found behind fringing beds of the grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Most Spartina beds are small (&lt; 30 m in length) and unoccupied by any cobble beach plant spe cies, and a there is a strong, positive relationship between bed length and plant species richness. Results from field experiments indicate that long beds reduce wave-related disturbance much more than smaller beds and that the required degree of habitat modification for successful population establishment is quite variable among species. Rare species appear to be habitat specialists, preferring a small cobble/gravel microhabitat that is gen erally only found behind beds longer than 100 m. This apparently generates a nested distributional pattern in which species that are rare on a landscape scale are restricted to the longest Spartina beds. Additionally, population transitions (i.e. colonization and extinction) were strongly correlated with bed length and isolation (distance to the nearest neighboring conspecific population). Thus in this system, landscape-scale patterns of species dis tributions, dynamics, richness, and composition appear to be controlled by habitat patch attributes such as size and spacing.

The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems plays a major role in the assessment of the global carbon cycle. Ecosystem discrimination, Ae, pro vides a spatially and temporally flux-weighted estimate of carbon isotope effects during the CO2 exchange of entire ecosystems. Globally, A. is im portant for constraining the metabolism of the biosphere in any analysis of the global carbon budget. A, defined as (813CtrOposphere - 8'3Cecosyster respiration) / (1 + 8'3cec.systemrespiration) is mainly based on canopy air measurements, thus includes plant fractionations as well as soil disequilibrium effects. Field studies identified seasonality, life form, plant community, and leaf area index as the main sources of variation in Ah. We also hypothesized that different ecosystem water-use efficiencies would be reflected in the variability of Ae, analogous to variations of A at the leaf-level. Model simulations with the BIOME4 global biosphere model supported this hy pothesis. We found an almost linear, negative relationship between Ae and the ratio of canopy assimilation to canopy conductance for twenty-seven biomes. Modeled and measured A, estimates matched quite well, except in areas where human land use had strongly altered the potential natural veg etation. Further analyses showed that changes in vegetation cover account ed for discrepancies in A, of several per mil. Thus, historical and recent land use changes are considered relevant sources of variation in A, at the global scale. BUCKLEY, T. N., 12 J. M. MILLER' and G. D.

Simultaneous optimization of canopy nitrogen and water use. Nitrogen is optimally distributed in a canopy when the dA/dN is the same for all leaves (A is integrated daily carbon gain and N is nitrogen per unit leaf area). We simultaneously optimized canopy nitrogen allocation and water use with a simulation that combines several recent refinements in canopy modeling. Optimal nitrogen profiles predicted by this model differ from the steep exponential profiles predicted by models that do not account for optimization of water use. For a given total canopy nitrogen content, these optimal profiles are generally less steep and more nearly linear than exponential profiles. These optimal profiles also depend on total canopy nitrogen content and water use, generally becoming less steep with increas ing nitrogen and/or water availability. Additionally, the photosynthetic ca 64 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="26">pacity of any given leaf layer in these optimal profiles is not always related to total canopy nitrogen content or water use in a simple fashion. These patterns can be explained in part by variation (with nitrogen or water sup ply) in the vertical distribution of relative stomatal limitation that emerges when both nitrogen allocation and water use are optimal, and when the canopy model incorporates distinct phases of photosynthesis limitation (carbon fixation and electron transport) and separate integration of sunlit and shaded leaf fractions.

Agriculture in the Great Plains: Net carbon consequences of dryland and irrigated cultivation. Historical cultivation management in the Great Plains is known to have resulted in relatively large net losses of carbon from soil organic matter. However, management practices have changed considerably over the past several decades, and it is difficult to sample changes in total soil organic matter over short time intervals. We installed Bowen Ratio towers to eval uate current annual net ecosystem production in fields representing two of the key agricultural practices of northeastern Colorado, dryland wheat-fal low and irrigated corn, in both 1998 and 1999 growing seasons. Seasonal dynamics differed strongly between the two systems, with maximum car bon capture occurring during peak leaf area index for each crop, during June for wheat and August for corn. Irrigated corn represented a relatively strong carbon sink, with a net ecosystem production of approximately 0.3 kg m-2 per year for 1998. Dryland wheat fallow showed negative annual net ecosystem production for 1998 and 1999 at rates averaging -0.1 kg m 2. Our data suggest that the balance of dryland and irrigated agriculture vs. native rangelands may have important consequences for regional carbon balance. BURNAFORD, J. L. Oregon State University, Corvallis OR 97331, USA. The importance of shade to community structure: Positive interactions in the low rocky intertidal zone. The shade provided by plant canopies has been shown to have major effects on understory plant abundance and diversity in terrestrial and salt marsh systems. However, few studies on canopy effects have been conducted in marine systems, and fewer have addressed the effect of canopies on her bivores. I used field manipulations to examine the effect of an algal canopy on a low rocky intertidal zone community in Washington State. In previous studies, removal of the canopy-forming kelp Hedophyllum sessile resulted in dramatic changes in the understory algal assemblage and the abundance of the system's major herbivore, the chiton Katharina tunicata. Canopy removal can expose understory organisms to predation by birds and in creased heat stress. To determine the mechanism behind the maintenance of the original understory community, I monitored five experimental treat ments (natural Hedophyllum canopy, artificial shades, bird exclosures, ma nipulation controls, and open plots) over two years. During the spring and summer, mobile invertebrates, including the chiton Katharina, were more abundant in plots with shade (artificial shade and natural Hedophyllum canopy) than in unshaded plots. During the fall and winter, invertebrate abundances did not differ between treatments. The algal understory assem blage was different in plots with and without shade in all seasons, but was similar in plots with natural Hedophyllum canopy and artificial shade. Birds had no effect on invertebrate abundance or the algal assemblage in any season. These results show that shade is the important factor in maintaining the low zone Hedophyllum-associated community, and the seasonal impor tance of shade to mobile animals suggests that the amelioration of heat stress is the mechanism behind these patterns. Positive interactions are considered important structuring forces for communities in harsh environ ments; this example of an important community-level effect of a plant canopy is a unique example of a positive interaction in a "low stress' habitat.

A common feature of many Antarctic lakes is the presence of a deep chlo rophyll maximum layer (DCM). The DCM is a layer of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass well below the water's surface. Such a DCM layer generally is found near a nitracline with a peak of primary production coincident with or just above that same maximum. DCMs are common to many regions and appear to arise from several different factors. Data pro vided by the McMurdo Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to examine four lakes in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica, (east Bonney, west Bonney, Fryxell, Hoare). Stepwise linear regressions were used to test the hypothesis that DCMs in these permanently ice-covered lakes were re source limited. The variables examined were: Photosynthetically active ra diation (PAR) intensity, soluble reactive phosphorous concentrations, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH4 + NO2 + NO3) concentrations. Using data from all depths, the overall model for east Lake Bonney had an R2 value of 0.554, with PAR being the most significant factor. Values for Lakes Fryxell, Hoare and Bonney west were (0.182, 0.661, and 0.254 respective ly)-dissolved inorganic nitrogen was the most significant factor in these models. When analyses focused on depths bracketing the DCM, dissolved inorganic nitrogen was the most important factor for all lakes; R2 values decreased in Bonney east (0.352); remained essentially identical in Fryxell (0.186); and increased in Bonney west (0.329). Lake Hoare has no distinct DCM layer. BURTON, R. S. Alverno College, Milwaukee, WI 53234 USA. The Mock EIS: A problem-based learning activity. The National Science Foundation has recommended that college science courses get students "involved in groups working on real, open-ended prob lems." One activity that allows students this experience is the development of a mock environmental impact statement (EIS). This project lends itself readily to problem-based learning. Students must define the problem, iden tify questions and needed information, gather information using a variety of tools, synthesize concepts from different disciplines and work together to come up with feasible plans which they must then present and defend. The activity is flexible enough to be used in ecology and environmental science courses with classes of varying size and composition. For more information, see: http://www.execpc.com/-nsmt/meis.htm.

Variability in the rate of increase and spread of non-native species con founds efforts to predict their long-term impact. The Japanese mudsnail, Batillaria attramentaria, invaded marshes of northern California over a multi-year span earlier this century, and has begun to displace its native ecological equivalent, Cerithidea californica. Due to differences in the year of Batillaria's introduction, variation exists among marshes in the pro gression of the invasion-from virtual extinction of the native, to equal den sities of native and exotic. Therefore, I could examine the snails in a marsh where species densities were equal, but with knowledge of the ultimate timing of the native species' extirpation by the invader gleaned from nearby marshes. Density and demographic data of the two interacting snails over 5 years in 5 independent sites in Bolinas Marsh demonstrate a significantly negative population growth rate in Cerithidea (r = -0.22), while Batillaria exhibited no net change in population size. Multiple regression indicated Batillaria density strongly influenced Cerithidea's rate of decline. This relationship suggests that the present rapid rate of decline likely grew only as Batillaria reached higher densities, explaining why projection of Cer ithidea's current rate of decline underestimates its true time to extinction. The relationship further suggests that spatial variation in invader density may be a surrogate for temporal data to anticipate the effects of increases in invader density on native population growth. I present an analytical framework based on coupled Lotka-Volterra competition equations, and concrete steps for parameterization using life table type calculations from field data on individual growth rates and size-fecundity relationships. This technique improves extinction time estimates by incorporating the effect of constantly changing densities on r and also captures the long lag time in invader increase commonly observed in invasion studies.

Blowing in the wind: The passive overland dispersal of freshwater zooplankton. Experimental studies of dispersal and colonization by zooplankton are rare, making it difficult to assess the relative importance of local vs. regional processes in the structuring of aquatic systems. To test for colonization rates and identify potential dispersal vectors, we performed a field exper iment in which we manipulated access to 150 L mesocosms. Treatments were: 1) Closed (covered with plastic), 2) 500 um netting, 3) 2.5 cm net ting, 4) 10 cm netting, and 5) open (no netting). The 25 enclosures were placed in a Latin Square design within our experimental pond facility that has numerous ponds and cattle tanks as potential sources of zooplankton. Each tank was sterilized and then filled with filtered city water (1 um). Sampling was weekly for May-August 1998 and biweekly or monthly thereafter. After 79 weeks, there was no significant effect of mesh size on the number of taxa per treatment (p=0.49). Of the 26 non-insect taxa found to invade the array, on average only 13.9 ? 0.6 (SE) taxa were recorded from each enclosure. The fact that the 500 um-mesh treatment received this many colonists indicates that at least some taxa are transported easily by wind and rain. Bdelloid and monogonant rotifers were the first non insect colonists, beginning in week 3. The cyclopoid copepod Eucyclops agilis, which eventually colonized all of the enclosures, was first found at week 5. The first cladoceran, Chydorus sphaericus, appeared at week 8, but several cladoceran species were not found until the following spring. Diaptomid copepods, although present at the pond site, were never found in the mesocosms. Our results suggest dispersal limitation of some taxa, but also highlights the importance of local processes in structuring zoo plankton assemblages. CABIN, R.,' S. WELLER,2 D. LORENCE,3 S.

Like many other tropical dry forest ecosystems, Hawaiian dry forests are severely endangered and degraded. On the Island of Hawaii, remnant dry forests are dominated by fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum), a highly invasive exotic bunchgrass that suppresses native vegetation and greatly increases the risk of fire. To investigate plausible cost-effective methods for controlling fountain grass and re-establishing native plant populations, we established 8 experimental blocks in a highly degraded, treeless area dominated by fountain grass. Each block consisted of 4, 6 by 6m plots randomly assigned to 1 of 4 fountain grass control treatments: Control, weed whack/herbicide, weed whack/black plastic mulch (to suppress and "cook" the remaining fountain grass), and bulldoze (to completely remove fountain grass from the plot). We also erected 50% shade cloth structures over 4 randomly selected blocks to simulate shade conditions found under intact native dry forests. We divided each plot into 4 quadrats: 1 outplant quadrat, 1 direct-seed quadrat, and 2 control quadrats, and watered all quad rats twice weekly. Six months after outplanting or seeding with a mixture of 12 native species, we found that the number of individuals and percent cover of native plants was significantly greater in the shaded vs. full sun plots, and found no significant difference between the % cover of fountain grass within these 2 treatments. The number of individuals and % cover of native species was greatest in the bulldozed plots, intermediate in the weed whack/herbicide and weed whack/plastic treatments, and least in the control plots. Percent cover of fountain grass did not differ among the 3 fountain grass removal treatments, which were all less than 1/5 that of the untreated control plots. We also found that the % cover of native species was greatest in the outplanted quadrats, intermediate in the seeded quadrats, and lowest in the control quadrats, while the % cover of fountain grass was greatest in the control quadrats and did not differ between the out planted and seeded quadrats. These results suggest that relatively cheap and efficient techniques such as bulldozing and direct-seeding of native species can be employed to control fountain grass and restore Hawaii's native dry forest communities.

Density dependent mortality due to intra- and interspecific competition for resources can be viewed as a constraint on plant performance. Viewing the self-thinning process as a constraint on plant performance suggests that changes in the upper quantiles of the density distributions will convey more reliable information on this process than changes in the center or lower quantiles of the density distributions, where other processes may be the active constraint. I demonstrate recent advances in a class of statistical estimators, termed regression quantiles, that provide estimated rates of change for all percentiles of probability distributions. Example analyses of density dependent mortality due to intraspecific competition for two Chi huahuan Desert annuals, Eriogonum abertianum and Haplopappus gracilis, indicated an exponential functional form was appropriate for both species but parameter estimates differed between them. Constraints on densities at the end of the growing season initially increased and then decreased with increasing germination densities for both species, but the decrease occurred at higher germination densities for Haplopappus than for Eriogonum. A modification of the basic regression quantile analysis using geometric means of two estimates was made to estimate linear density dependent changes due to interspecific competition between Eriogonum and Haplo pappus, where neither species can be regarded as the dependent variable in a regression model. Advantages of the regression quantile estimates are discussed relative to those from other regression procedures and nonstatis tical methods. CAHILL, JR., J.

Understanding how competition varies with productivity is essential to dif ferentiate among alternative models of community organization. Recent work has demonstrated that root and shoot competition interact to affect plant growth, and attempts to explain shifts in competition along gradients based upon additive interactions between competitive forms fail to capture the dynamics of competition which actually occur. Root and shoot com petition were separated using exclusion tubes and tiebacks in a successional community. Individuals of four species (Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Rumex crispus, and Plantago lanceolata) were grown at two levels of fertilization in four competition treatments (full, aboveground, belowground, none). In contrast to predictions from current models, but in agreement with other experimental studies, there was no change in the strengths of root, shoot, or total competition with an increase in productiv ity. Despite no effect of fertilization on the strength of competition, the interaction between root and shoot competition varied as a function of species identity and fertilization. For some species the combined effects of root and shoot competition were less than that predicted assuming no in teraction, with some species switching from an additive to a negative in teraction with fertilization. If root-shoot interactions are common in natural systems, then simply measuring the strength of one form of competition in no way provides any information about its overall importance to plant growth.

Complex plasticity in complex environments: Early spring flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana. Multiple environmental factors accelerate or delay flowering time, affecting both individual fitness and population growth. Some factors are predictable (photoperiod), others more variable (temperature). Large-scale phenomena (long-distance migration, climate change) may disrupt the predictability of any given factor. We investigated the extent to which complex environ mental variation and complex plasticity are related in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this model species, flowering time responds plastically to at least three seasonally-variable, light-related factors: intensity, spectral quality, and photoperiod. It also responds to a fourth seasonally-variable factor, vernal ization. Arabidopsis typically flowers during the transition from winter to spring, when all four factors may change in an imperfectly concordant fashion. Unlike molecular geneticists, who study how multiple photorecep 66 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="28">tors and light- or vernalization-sensitive loci are integrated in Arabidopsis, we examine flowering time plasticity from an evolutionary ecology per spective. We report results of an artificial selection study conducted with a wild, naturally variable, spring-flowering population from Michigan. We selected two "high" and two "low" lines for enhanced or diminished plas ticity to light with a reduced red to far-red ratio. Although only the two high lines diverged significantly from two random control lines, we were able to use among-family variation in all six lines to examine genetic cor relations among traits and trait plasticities. We found that correlations be tween flowering time and total fruit production are extremely environment dependent. We also found non-significant correlations between light- and vernalization-mediated plasticities of flowering time. Results are consistent with models based on molecular genetic data. Moreover, the strengths of such correlations may impose constraints on the adaptive evolution of flow ering time and its phenotypic plasticity. CALLAWAY, R. M. and E.

Co-evolution in plant communities: Invaders interact differently with new neighbors than with old ones. Little attention has been paid to the possibility that long-term associations among plants may promote co-evolution, and coexistence among interact ing species in natural communities. In part the lack of interest in such co evolved interactions is because plant communities are widely thought to be "individualistic", composed primarily of plant species that have similar adaptations to a particular physical environment. We compared the com petitive effects of an invasive Eurasian forb in North America, Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed), on three grass species that co-exist with C. diffusa in Eurasia to the effects of C. diffusa on three grass species from North America, each of which is closely related to one of the Eurasian grass species. We found that Centaurea diffusa had much stronger negative effects on grass species from North America than on closely related grass species from communities to which Centaurea is native. Centaurea's ad vantage against North American species appears to be due to differences in the effects of its root exudates and how these root exudates affect com petition for resources. Our results suggest that natural plant communities may be more co-evolved entities than is generally thought, and may help to explain why exotic species so successfully invade them. CANHAM, C.

Interspecific variation in susceptibility to windthrow as a function of tree size and storm severity for northern temperate tree species. Studies of the effects of wind disturbance on forests typically focus on the most severe, catastrophic disturbances; however, it is clear that wind dis turbance regimes are characterized by events with a wide range of severity. Studies of these intermediate-intensity events have been hampered by the lack of methods to quantify variation in both storm severity and the re sponses of dominant tree species to winds of varying intensity. We report here the development of a new, empirical method of simultaneously esti mating both local storm severity and the parameters of functions that define species-specific variation in susceptibility to windthrow as a function of storm severity and tree size. We tested the method using data collected following a severe storm that struck the western Adirondack Mountains of New York in 1995. That region contains one of the largest remaining tracts of old growth forest in the northeastern U.S., and our analyses allowed us to also examine differences in susceptibility to windthrow in old growth versus second growth forests. Our results highlight significant variation among tree species in both their susceptibility to windthrow across a gra dient in storm severity, and variation in susceptibility to windthrow as a function of tree size and the successional status of the stand. Our results suggest that some of the distinctive features of old growth forests in the region may be due to variation among trees in their ability to survive disturbance events that vary widely in intensity.

Comparison of biological communities: The problem of sample representativeness. Obtaining an adequate, representative sample of biological communities or assemblages to make richness or compositional comparisons among sites is a continuing challenge. Traditionally, sample size is based on numbers of replicates or area collected or numbers of individuals enumerated and representativeness is based on the survey design as well as sample size. However, how well a sample actually represents the community from which it is drawn and what effect variation in the level of representativeness among sites has on site-to-site comparisons have been ignored. Sample representativeness (SR) literally means the similarity between a sample and its community in species composition and relative abundance. Without knowing the structure of a targeted community, the similarity among rep licates randomly drawn from the community, i.e., autosimilarity, can be used to estimate SR. Using both field and simulated data we show that samples of equal size (area or number of individuals) from different sites differentially represent their communities. As a result, the proportion of total taxa richness at a site (%TTR) reached with a fixed sample size varied across sites and the site-to-site differences in TR changed with sample size. Consequently, a sample-size bias is introduced into the site-to-site com parisons. Using the same simulated and field data sets, we found the fol lowing: 1) Samples of equal size from different sites reached different levels of autosimilarity with lower levels reached in species-richer sites, indicating variation in how well samples of equal size represent their re spective communities. 2) Autosimilarity positively and almost linearly cor related with %TTR indicating that autosimilarity may be a good predictor of richness. 3) Standardization of autosimilarity produced similar %TTR across different sites, i.e., the relative differences in taxa richness among sites becomes independent of sample size. Our preliminary results also indicate that standardizing on autosimilarity produced more stable com parisons of community composition among sites. We conclude that the standardization on autosimilarity can effectively reduce some of the un desirable effects of samples of equal size and improve the accuracy of the community comparisons. CAPRIO, A. C. Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, Three Rivers, CA 93271, USA. Reconstructing attributes of pre-Euroamerican set tlement fire at a watershed scale, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Fire history studies utilizing fire scarred material have typically involved sampling one to a few sites in particular locations or vegetation types. However, sampling at such a local scale limits our ability to resolve attri butes and variation in pre-Euroamerican settlement fire regimes at a land scape scale. The objective of this study was to reconstruct attributes of past fires regimes at a large scale by collecting a network of sites from through out the conifer belt of a 24,591 ha watershed in the southern Sierra Nevada. The network of sites, located across aspects, vegetation types and eleva tions, permitted a spatial and temporal reconstruction of the drainage's fire history for the period from 1700 to 1920 when written fire records begin. Analysis showed strong differences between north and south aspects, par ticularly at low-to-mid elevations &lt;2286 m, with fire return intervals on north aspects averaging about three times longer than on south aspects (31.8 yr and 9.1 yr respectively). In contrast, at higher elevations differ ences did not appear to be as significant. Additionally, the network of sites allowed GIS techniques to be used to create maps from which coarse annual estimates of area burned were determined. The maps showed considerable annual variability and indicated that in most years area burned was small (&lt;300 ha) although uncommon years occurred when large fires burned through much of the conifer forest in the drainage. Reconstructed burn area size was also related to aspect and elevation with frequent small fires oc curring on lower south aspects while less frequent but larger fires occurred across all aspects but dominated north and upper elevation south aspects. Average area burned annually was greatest on low elevation south, aspects (320 ha or 11.5% of the area) and lowest on upper elevation north aspects (37 ha or 1.2% of the area). Larger fires on all aspects appeared to be closely linked to annual climatic conditions. Within this complex landscape the characteristics of pre-Euroamerican fire undoubtedly had significant in fluences on ecosystem dynamics that varied spatially and temporally.

Re constructing the historic ecosystems of Swede Hollow, Minnesota: An investigation in urban paleoecology. Swede Hollow is a small valley in St. Paul, Minnesota, about ten hectares in size, fifteen to thirty meters deep and one kilometer upstream from the Mississippi River. Swede Hollow was settled in the 1840's and abandoned in the 1950's, with a maximum occupancy estimated at 200 people. As part of the multi-stakeholder Lower Phalen Creek Restoration Plan, the goals for Swede Hollow include the reconstruction of its 'historic ecosys tems'. While this is not an unambiguous concept, one component of it is almost certainly the identification of the pre-settlement plant communities. It was the goal of this project to identify the plant communities present in Swede Hollow before European-American settlement in the mid-1800's, and this goal was incorporated into the design of Ecology labs at Metro politan State University in the spring of 1999 and 2000. Students in the class collected data on the current composition and distribution of woody plants in Swede Hollow, analyzed size-class distributions of mixed species groves, examined historical records and photographs, and visited analogous sites in other nearby valleys. Paleoecological analysis of pond sediments was not possible because the ponds are less than 40 years old. Results suggest that the area supported oak woodland on the uppermost slopes, mesic oak forest on middle to lower slopes, and floodplain forest on the valley floor. Dry cliff vegetation may have existed on the patches of ex posed sandstone and limestone. Former house sites were identifiable by the presence of stonework and ornamental exotics such as catalpa, buckthorn, honeysuckle and mock-orange. CARDELUS, C.

To understand how biotic and environmental factors influence vascular epi phyte distribution, I measured tree characteristics, microenvironment and vascular epiphyte abundance in the canopies of three tree species: Lecythis ampla, Terminalia amazonia and Hyeronima alchorneoides at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Sixteen 0.5m by 0.5m quadrats were estab lished on canopy branches of two individuals of each species. Atmospheric humidity, photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, soil moisture, soil pH, branch diameter, branch angle and branch height, vascular epiphyte cover and species composition were recorded for each quadrat. Epiphyte species composition differed among these three tree species, with no spe cies overlap observed between Terminali a and Hyeronima. Significant dif ferences in microclimate were also recorded among tree species, mostly with respect to relative humidity and light. Humidity in Hyeronima is main tained at 97% diurnally, whereas Terminalia and Lecythis have more var iable humidity, probably due to their more open canopies. Canonical cor respondence analysis of epiphyte communities within the canopy revealed clear groupings, with the first and second axes most stongly influenced by humidity and light. Results indicate that tree characteristics and microcli mate strongly influence vascular epiphtye distribution. CARDINALE, B. J.' 'University of Maryland, College Park, MD; 2Na tional Science Foundation, Washington, DC. Linking species diversity to the functioning of ecosystems: On the importance of environmental context. Despite many recent efforts to determine how species loss might alter the functioning of ecosystems, there is still considerable debate about the role of biodiversity in ecosystems. In part, this is because studies have yet to find any consistent relationship between the rates of ecological processes and the number of species inhabiting a system. We will present theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting there may not be a generalizable rela tionship between diversity and ecosystem functioning because the affect of species diversity on ecological processes changes with environmental con text. We began with a model that determined the rates of several ecological processes in systems where taxa interacted competitively in landscapes varying in habitat heterogeneity, disturbance frequency, and species diver sity. The model predicted that species diversity should have less influence on ecological processes in systems that experience disturbance compared to those that do not. HIabitat heterogeneity, however, might increase or decrease the affect of diversity on processes depending on which habitat types compose the landscape. We tested these predictions in a laboratory experiment that manipulated the species richness of a group of common aquatic insects (filter-feeding caddisflies) in artificial streams having two levels of benthic substrate heterogeneity and two levels of disturbance fre quency. We then measured how several ecological processes varied with diversity in each of the four types of environments. Disturbance had the most profound effect on the diversity/function relationship; carbon flux and algal productivity both increased with increasing diversity in streams that were disturbed, but algal productivity decreased with increasing diversity in undisturbed streams. Changes in productivity may have been mediated by the cycling of phosphorus, which changed with species richness in a manner that was dependent on an interaction between heterogeneity and disturbance. Taken collectively, our results suggest that, for any given group of organisms, a number of different relationships between species diversity and ecosystem function are possible.

An on-going fertilization experiment is being conducted in a trembling aspen, Populous tremuloides, and lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. la tifolia, stand in the Colorado Front Range. This project focuses on the impacts of increased N deposition within and between forest types and is relevant to understanding ecosystem and landscape level nutrient cycling dynamics. Background anthropogenic deposition to these stands is approx imately 5 kg N ha-' yr1 and an additional 25 kg N ha-' yr' is being applied to simulate increased deposition. Our objectives are to determine the im pacts of ammonium nitrate fertilization on (1) nitrogen cycling within and between forest types and (2) leaching losses of nitrogen from the two forest cover types. Net N mineralization and nitrification measurements during the growing season were highest in the aspen organic horizon (net N min eralization: 9.6 ug g-' 30 d-' and net nitrification: 4.1 ug g-1 30 d-') while the lodgepole pine organic horizon immobilized nitrogen (-6.2 ug g-' 30 d Im and 0.0 ug g-' 30 d-1). These differences are supported by significantly lower C:N ratios in the aspen soil (14.7, partly due to presence of nitrogen fixing species in the understory) than in the lodgepole pine soil (30.7) which leads to greater mobility of N in the aspen stand. Initial results from fertilization indicate that the aspen stand has a decreased capacity for N retention/immobilization than the lodgepole pine stand, resulting in a varied response of the montane forests in the Colorado Front Range to increasing N deposition.

Pollination biology of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens: Palmae) in south western Florida. We characterized timing and mechanisms of flowering and pollination for saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), a bushy palm species native to the south eastern United States. We designed the study to accomplish three primary objectives: 1) quantify duration of anthesis, 2) characterize timing of pol lination, and 3) determine if insect pollinators are required for seed set. We documented timing of anthesis and pollination by observing opening of marked flowers during 12-hour periods, and by quantifying anther dehis cence, presence of nectar and stigma receptivity for flowers collected at increasing times after opening. We characterized the breeding system of saw palmetto by quantifying seed set of experimentally manipulated flow ers. In addition, we identified potential insect pollinators by observing vis itation to flowers, and quantifying polIen loads on collected insect visitors. We found that anthesis lasted approximately 4 days. Flowers were weakly protandrous, with anther dehiscence occurring primarily during the first day of anthesis, and stigma receptivity primarily during the second through fourth day. Probability of pollination was highest on the second day of anthesis, when stigmas were receptive and presence of nectar in flowers was reliable. Saw palmetto flowers were facultatively xenogamous, with insects needed for transfer of pollen. Of 34 species of insects that we 68 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="30">observed visiting the flowers, the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) and three native bee species appeared to be primary pollinators.

Do ground-dwelling mammals pro mote high tropical tree diversity: Testing Janzen-Connell at the com munity level. We have been excluding ground-dwelling mammals with exclosures for 6 years in the understory at two old-growth forest sites in Panama. Excluding mammalian seed and seedling predators has led to the establishment of dense seedling carpets of a number of tree species. These seedling carpets have now persisted for many years, even through a severe El Nino drought. Species richness of seedlings on a per stem basis increased for three years, but now has returned to control levels. This suggests that there is a sub stantial lag time before species richness actually declines following the exclusion of mammals, which is consistent with predictions of the Janzen Connell Hypothesis. Overall, predation and browsing have reduced seed ling growth and survivorship, demonstrating that these factors are impor tant following seedling establishment. At very high seedling densities in side exclosures, however, we have detected density dependent mortality, suggesting that in the absence of seed predators and herbivores, seedlings begin to compete even under fairly dense shade. Thus, predation and browsing on many species of seedlings is as important as light availability with regard to establishment and persistence in the shaded understory. A clear confirmation of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis (i.e., significantly low er diversity inside exclosures in the understory) will likely require at least several more years of experimental exclusion of mammals. CASPERSEN, J. and S. PACALA. Princeton, NJ 08540, USA. Land-use history and carbon storage in forest ecosystems. Evidence from a variety of methods has led to a consensus that there is a large carbon sink in the northern hemisphere. However, there is little con sensus concerning the processes responsible for this sink. Numerous ex perimental studies suggest that growth enhancement through carbon diox ide and nitrogen fertilization is insufficient to account for the magnitude of the carbon sink. Thus, there has been increasing focus on land-use changes as an alternative explanation for the sink, particulary land-use changes in forested regions with a history of widespread agricultural aban donment. Estimating the relative contribution of regrowth and enhancement to the northern hemisphere carbon sink and predicting future carbon di oxide concentrations requires an assessment of how the history of land abandonment affects current rates of carbon accummulation and how long it will continue to do so. We have used the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) dataset to quantify how aboveground net ecosystem production (ANEP) changes during stand development and evaluate the mechanisms driving changes in ANEP Our analysis shows that ANEP peaks rapidly (within 10-20 years) and then gradually declines until stand biomass equil ibrates (within 200-500 years). Due to the disparate time-scales of the increasing and decreasing phases of ANEP, the rate of decline largely de termines the ANEP of secondary forests and how long it will take forests to recover from past clearance. Yet, there is little agreement about what mechanisms govern the rate at which ANEP declines as stands develop. One demographic hypothesis is that ANEP declines as the total amount of carbon lost through tree mortality increases as trees get bigger. Thus, forest biomass equilibrates when a stand reaches a stable size distribution. Three other ecosystem-level hypothesis suggest that tree growth declines as stands develop, due to increased plant respiration, decreased nutrient cycling or decreased stomatal conductance. Our analysis shows that the decline of ANEP is driven largely by demographic changes in carbon loss rather than changes in uptake (tree growth). The results of our analyses have important implications for efforts to model the terrestrial carbon cycle and predict the trajectory of atmospheric carbon dioxide. CASTANHA, C. and R. AMUNDSON. UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 3050 USA. Parent material controls over carbon and nitrogen storage in California. To be applicable at regional scales, soil organic matter (SOM) models need to be parameterized on the basis of easily acquired information, and there fore generally incorporate mean annual air temperature and precipitation, soil texture, and vegetation class. But, SOM models do not explicitly in corporate parent material, which, along with climate, influences clay con tent and organic matter storage patterns. Our goal is to assess the impor tance of parent material on SOM stocks by quantifying its observed rela tionship to C and N storage and to properties relevant to C cycling. Here, we examine the statistical relationships between the predictor variables par ent material, climate, and clay and the response variables total organic C, total N, and clay. The data represent 334 well-drained upland soils formed from 7 rock types, each spanning approximately the same mean annual temperature and precipitation range. We test the effect of parent material on a) organic C and N storage, b) sensitivity of C and N to clay, and c) the depth distribution of C and N. We conclude that parent material a) has a statistical effect on C and N storage, b) moderates the sensitivity of C and N to clay, and c) influences the depth distribution of C and N.

Predators of Orgyia leucostigma larvae create vibratory signals as they approach caterpillars. Larvae respond to these signals in an assessment of risk of of predation presented by different predators and exhibit appropriate anti-predator behaviors. 0. leucostigma caterpillars respond to particular frequency and amplitude components of the substrate-borne vibrations made by active foraging predators. These signals enable caterpillars to dis tinguish between predators, non-predators such as herbivores, and abiotic factors. The costs of these behaviors under different ecological conditions were measured. Predator avoidance involved falling to the ground. How ever, larvae are able to orient to trees after dropping and thus reduce the cost of dropping. The highest cost of inducing anti-predator behavior oc cured when caterpillars fell to the ground on sites with high densities of ground predators. CASTELLI, J. P. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA. Arbuscular mycorrhizal specificity, compatibility, and feedback be tween co-occurring species in a tallgrass prairie. Despite having the potential to mediate species diversity within natural systems, feedback between plants and the soil microbial community remain relatively unexplored. While patterns of specificity between arbuscular my corrhizal fungal (AMF) and plant species have been documented in many systems, evidence for a link between these patterns and potential soil feed backs are lacking. In this study the AMF communities associated with Schizychrium scoparium and Andropogon gerardii were compared for their compatibility with individuals of each plant species using reciprocal root inoculations. Individuals of both plant species had significantly higher root infection by the AMF associated with conspecifics, but achieved a signif icantly higher biomass when grown with the AMF associated with the other species. This implies that individuals of these plant species are culturing AMF which are "over" infective towards conspecifics creating a negative plant-soil feedback. These results were consistent in both greenhouse and field experiments, but only when plants and fungi were grown in the same soil from which the fungi were isolated. This illustrates the importance of examining mycorrhizal relationships in biologically relevant soils. Char acterization of the AMF communities associated with each species based on spores isolated from field, trap culture, and experimental soils revealed little differences besides the preferential association of S. scoparium and Glomus intraradices. The overall lack of species-level specificity observed between the two AMF communities was surprising given the significant differences in plant species compatibility they demonstrated.

Despite increasing levels of nitrogen deposition at temperate latitudes, no studies to date have considered how this perturbation will alter temperate forest species composition. Nitrogen deposition may affect mixed forests in particular due to differences between evergreen coniferous and decidu ous broad-leaved species. We investigated regeneration responses of both Oral Presentation Abstracts 69</page><page sequence="31">types of species to nitrogen deposition, and compared these responses across coniferous and broad-leaved stand types. We addressed nitrogen ef fects on (1) understory seedling bank development, and (2) seedling re sponses to canopy gap formation. We applied nitrogen (0, 2.5, 7.5 g m-2 yrl) both to replicated understory plots in three conifer and three broad leaved dominated stands, and to seedlings growing in high light conditions in soil from each stand. We examined seedling survival and growth for three coniferous and three broad-leaved species over two years. Nitrogen differentially influenced species' regeneration patterns, although the nature of these effects depended on light environment. In the understory, changes in seedling bank structure were driven primarily by differential seedling survival, with nitrogen decreasing Acer rubrum and Picea rubens abun dance, and increasing Betula alleghaniensis abundance. Under gap condi tions, nitrogen predominantly increased seedling growth, with early-suc cessional broad-leaved species responding most strongly, and coniferous species remaining relatively unresponsive. Thus, increasing nitrogen de position will alter the composition of mixed temperate forests, but the exact nature of the change will depend on both current species composition and future patterns of disturbance.

Source-sink population dynamics of a Rocky Mountain mayfly: Estimating patch quality and dispersal. Predictions of metapopulation models depend critically on the degree of dispersal among patches and patch size or "quality," and successful man agement of spatially structured populations requires an understanding of the relationship between these parameters. However, few estimates of these parameters are available for natural populations, and thus, which types of metapopulations (e.g. mainland-island, source-sink, etc.) are common is unknown. To quantify the relative roles of patch quality and dispersal in a metapopulation, we have estimated larval survival, adult production, and recruitment of the mayfly Callibaetis ferrugineus hageni in a series of twelve beaver ponds in the upper East River valley of Colorado. The ponds vary in the presence/absence of trout predators, which covaries with depth-fishless ponds tend to be deeper in this system. Larval survival was markedly higher and adult production was approximately an order of mag nitude greater in "source" ponds without trout than "sink" ponds with trout. Larval survival may be related to fish predation and/or low oxygen during winter in shallow ponds. Subsequent recruitment did not differ be tween pond types as estimated by the density of ovipositing females and suggests that many females disperse from their natal habitat to oviposit, that females do not selectively avoid low quality habitat during oviposition, and that sinks are not recruitment limited. Thus, this population appears to follow a patchy source-sink dynamic where exchange among patches is high and patches differ markedly in their quality. This type of dynamic may be common in spatially structured populations where growth and dis persal occur in separate life-history stages. Identifying and conserving source patches is critical to managing populations that follow a source-sink metapopulation dynamic. CAVENDER-BARES, J. and N. M. HOLBROOK.

We investigated hydraulic properties of seventeen species of oaks (Quer cus) that occur sympatrically in northern central Florida. Leaf bearing stems from species in the section Lobatae (red/black oaks) had significantly high er specific conductivity and greater mean vessel diameters than species in the section Quercus s.s. (white oaks), while species of the subsection Vi rentes (live oaks) had intermediate values. Evergreen species had signifi cantly higher Huber values (ratio of sapwood area to distal leaf area) than deciduous species, however, there were no consistent differences in con ductivity or vessel diameters between evergreen and deciduous species. Across all species, specific conductivity was significantly correlated with mean vessel diameter and with the hydraulic contribution of vessels (r4). There were substantial differences in specific conductivity between species, while average vessel diameters showed less interspecific variation. There were also large differences between species and between clades in freeze thaw induced embolism. Deciduous species, on average, showed greater vulnerability to freezing than evergreen species. However, this effect may be largely due to the significantly higher vulnerability of white oaks, which are all deciduous, compared to live and red/black oaks, which include ev ergreen species. These results highlight the importance of taking evolu tionary lineage into account in comparative physiological studies. CHACE, J. F. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309, USA. Habitat and host selection by sympatric avian brood parasites in southeastern Arizona. Bronzed Cowbirds (Molothrus aeneus) and Brown-headed Cowbirds (M. ater) are obligate brood parasites that are sympatric during the breeding season from southern California east to Louisiana and south through central Mexico. In 1997-1999 I examined the degree of habitat and host parti tioning in the San Pedro Valley of southeastern Arizona. Bronzed Cowbirds are less common and more habitat selective than the Brown-headed Cow birds. While both cowbird species are most common within residential areas, Brown-headed Cowbirds are very common along the San Pedro Riv er where Bronzed Cowbirds are mostly absent, and Bronzed Cowbirds are most common in the montane canyons of the Huachuca Mountains. These brood parasites also overlap in host resources, but partition by host size, with the smaller Brown-headed typically parasitizing smaller hosts than the larger Bronzed Cowbird. 47% of 161 nests of host species monitored were parasitized, 38% by Brown-headed Cowbirds and 11% by Bronzed Cow birds. 3% of the host nests were parasitized by both cowbird species. Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism exceeded Bronzed Cowbird parasitism in all major habitat types studied. Overall, Brown-headed Cowbird para sitism was highest in the low elevation mesquite forests along the San Pedro River (64%, n=42), and Bronzed Cowbird parasitism highest in montane riparian canyons of the Huachuca Mountains (24%, n=43). The degree of habitat and host partitioning by these sympatric obligate brood parasites is low, resulting in competition for nests to parasitize. CHALCRAFT, D. R. I and W. J. RESETARITS, JR.2 'University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, U.S.A.; 2Old Dominion University,. Food preferences of keystone predators: Does a keystone predator prefer prey species with high relative abundances? Keystone predators were originally defined as predator species that have a disproportionately large effect on a prey community relative to their density or biomass, and more specifically, alter the outcome of competitive inter actions by preferentially consuming the competitive dominants. Competi tive dominants are prey species that have a stronger competitive impact than other prey species either by having a higher relative abundance and/ or a higher competitive effect. Whether keystone predators preferentially consume competitive dominants because of their relatively higher density or because of factors relating to their competitive ability is unknown. We examined this question in artificial ponds using a documented keystone predator, Notopthalmus viridescens, and tadpole prey, Bufo terrestris and Rana utricularia. Previous experiments suggest that B. terrestris and R. utricularia are competitive equivalents. We experimentally manipulated the total abundance and relative abundance of B. terrestris and R. utricularia to test the hypothesis that Notopthalmus viridescens will preferentially con sume the numerically dominant prey species. N. viridescens eat a constant proportion of B. terrestris regardless of total tadpole density or relative abundance. N. viridescens also eat R. utricularia tadpoles but their total effect on survivorship appears to diminish at higher tadpole densities and when R. utricularia is numerically dominant. Thus, N. viridescens consume fewer total tadpole prey when R. utricularia is numerically dominant. How ever, mean change in N. viridescens biomass was not affected by total density or by the relative abundance of species. These results indicate that when the competitive ability of prey species are equivalent, preference for food items by N. viridescens is not based upon relative abundances. CHALEKIAN, J. S. and D. H.

The effects of dispersal and competition on the population dynamics of two dominant California coastal sage scrub species; California buckwheat and White sage. Southern California is one of the most floristically diverse regions in the world. However, recent data suggests native plant populations are being 70 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="32">reduced by both habitat destruction and the competitive effects of invasive annuals. Our study focused on 1) modeling the dispersal kernels of two dominant California coastal sage scrub species (California buckwheat and White sage), and 2) determining what factors most affect their probabilities of establishment. Dispersal kernels were quantified using a seed trap ex periment and modeled using non-linear regression. Seed traps were an chored into the ground, beginning at the canopy perimeter of a fruiting adult. Traps extended to a distance of 3 meters, at 1-meter intervals in all cardinal direction. The number of seeds was found to decay exponentially with distance, but decay rates differed dramatically between the two spe cies. At a distance of 2 meters from the source, the number of buckwheat seeds decayed by a mean of 96%, where the number of sage seeds only decayed by a mean of 60%. To understand factors that most affect estab lishment, sites containing established juveniles were located and compared to adjacent non-established sites for fine scale variation in local surround ings. Variables measured were percent cover weeds, seed density, gopher disturbance, and soil penetrability. Logistic regression models indicated both proportion of weeds and seed density significantly affected the prob ability of establishment of buckwheat. However, the probability of estab lishment for sage was only affected by proportion of weeds. The combined results suggest both species are negatively affected by the presence of in vasive annuals; however due to the difference in dispersal kernels, species specific population dynamics may vary dramatically at the local scale. These local scale dynamics may provide useful information for future man agement decisions. CHAPMAN, S. K., G. W KOCH and N. S. COBB. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA. Mechanisms and implications of herbivory-induced decrease in litter C/N ratio in pinyon pine. Herbivory effects on nutrient cycling have been demonstrated in a number of different ecosystems, but have not been examined in the arid coniferous systems found throughout the intermountain and southwestern U.S. In the pinyon - juniper woodland near Sunset Crater National Monument, Ari zona, a large proportion of pinyon pines (Pinus edulis ) are chronically infested with a scale insect, Matsucoccus acalyptus, while others are resis tant to this herbivore. Previous research has demonstrated that scale infes tation induces premature needle abscission, reducing mean needle lifetime from six to two years. We have found that this herbivore-induced response reduces nitrogen (N) retranslocation from senescing needles, decreasing the C/N ratio of needle litter by nearly 33%. We measured mass-specific rates of needle ethylene production as an indicator of tissue senescence and found an average of 0.24 nmol g-' h-I in scale-infested needles compared to 0.07 nmol g-I h-l in the senescent age class of scale-resistant trees and 0.05 nmol g-1 h-' for scale-free, non-senescent needles on resistant trees. We hypothesize that scale infestation induces ethylene production and nee dle senescence; thus, increasing availability of mobile forms of N to the mesophyll feeding herbivore. At the tree level, herbivory causes a large reduction in nutrient resorption efficiency, while at the system level the reduced C/N ratio may stimulate litter decomposition and increase soil N availability.

Biodiversity lost and found: The resurgence of indigenous fishes in the Lake Victoria region. In Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, a small satellite of Lake Victoria, 50% of the indigenous fishes disappeared from the open waters subsequent to the es tablishment of the introduced predatory Nile perch (Lates niloticus). How ever, several of these species persisted in wetland refugia (e.g., ecotonal wetlands, swamp lagoons). Over the past few years, overfishing of large Nile perch in Lake Nabugabo has coincided with a resurgence in the open waters of some indigenous species. In a 5-year study, we documented the pattern of resurgence in the lake using annual transects in the inshore and offshore waters of exposed (no wetland) and wetland habitats, and repeat sampling of swamp lagoons. In 1995, haplochromine cichlids were largely confined to inshore areas of wetland transects and were very rare in Nile perch stomachs, as were most other indigenous species with the exception of two open-water indigenous fishes and introduced tilapia. Comparison of fish distributions in Lake Nabugabo to two nearby satellite lakes without Nile perch suggested that some fishes had shifted their distribution from open waters to ecotonal wetlands in response to Nile perch predator pres sure. By 1999, haplochromine cichlids were abundant in inshore and off shore areas of exposed and wetland transects, and the size distribution had shifted to include a higher proportion of larger individuals. Several non cichlids also reappeared in the main lake including three of the four original mormyrid species. Resurgence of some haplochromine cichlids has also occurred in the larger Lakes Kyoga and Victoria. This demonstrates a quick response to a decrease in predator pressure induced by overfishing of Nile perch and highlights the importance of faunal refugia in the Lake Victoria basin. Nile perch show a strong ontogentic dietary shift from invertebrate feeding juveniles to piscivorus adults. Comparison of stomach contents of Nile perch between 1995 and 1999 in Lake Nabugabo, and between lakes where the predator is native and lakes where it has been introduced, showed that the size at which Nile perch shift to piscivory is larger when haploch romines are rare. Haplochromines are now reappearing in the stomachs of small Nile perch in Lake Nabugabo; and over time, we predict a fluctuating equilibrium between predators (fishermen and Nile perch) and prey. CHASE, J. M. University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA. Con tingency and predictability in wetland communities: Effects of envi ronment, history, and spatial scale. Much of ecological theory is based on the assumption that a single attractor known as an equilibrium or climax governs community structure. Alter natively, natural communities exhibit a wide variety of states, even under seemingly identical environmental conditions. Furthermore, some theories predict that communities can exhibit multiple stable states that depend on historical contingency. Nevertheless, historical contingency does not pre clude predictability. I present a theoretical analysis that predicts: 1) Local communities with higher resource supply (i.e., primary productivity) should be more historically contingent, and thus more divergent from one another than those with lower resource supply, 2) more disturbed communities should be less contingent than less disturbed communities, 3) local com munities with higher spatial connectance should be less contingent than those with lower spatial connectance. These predictions are upheld in ex periments and pattern-analyses in wetland communities. Finally, these pre dictions help to explain a variety of observations in natural communities, such as the scale-dependence often observed in the productivity-diversity relationship. Local productivity-diversity relationships can be 'hump shaped' while regional relationships are monotonic, because local com munity divergence (i.e., differential composition among local sites; beta diversity) increases with productivity.

As consumers of detritus and fungi, and as prey of spiders, Collembola form a major link in the detrital food web of forest-floor leaf litter. We performed two field experiments to determine the extent to which spider predation limits Collembola densities. In Experiment 1, we reduced den sities of cursorial (non-web building) spiders for 1.3 yrs by pitfall trapping in 2x2-m fenced plots. Activity-densities of several cursorial spider families were lowered, but the reduction was greatest for wolf spiders (&gt; 90%). Reducing spiders had no effect on total Collembola densities. However, after 1 yr densities of tomocerid Collembola, which accounted for 1/3 of the total Collembola biomass, were 2x higher in spider-removal plots, com pared to fenced and open controls. This difference persisted from May to September (p &lt; 0.001). In Experiment 2, conducted 2 yrs later, both cur sorial and web-building spiders were reduced by pitfall trapping and litter sifting for 1.3 yrs in 1-in2 fenced plots. Fenced controls (sifted and non sifted) and non-sifted open control plots were also established. At the end of the experiment, total Collembola densities were marginally higher in the removal plots compared to pooled controls (p = 0.080). Tomocerid num bers were higher in removal plots, but the apparent response was not sig nificant (p = 0.36). Reducing spider numbers had no indirect effect on the rate of disappearance of individually tethered leaves or leaves in litterbags. Results of Expts. 1 and 2 reveal that spider predation impacts Collembola populations, but effects are variable. Differences in Collembola responses Oral Presentation Abstracts 71</page><page sequence="33">have at least two possible explanations: 1) a 100-yr drought during Expt. 2 may have altered Collembola behavior, lowering their exposure to spider predation; and 2) different combinations of spider guilds were manipulated in the two experiments, differentially affecting patterns of intraguild pre dation and predation on Collembola.

Woody root decomposition was studied in Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine forests at Cascade Head, H. J. Andrews, and Pringle Falls Experimental Forests in Oregon, using a time series approach. Species sig nificantly influenced mass loss of fine and small roots during the first 2 years of decomposition. In contrast, no significant species effects on the decomposition of medium, large, jumbo roots were observed. For the same period, site differences had little impact on decomposition of roots, re gardless of root size. For fine roots, Oregon ash was the fastest among the 15 species examined during two years of decomposition, losing about 63% of its initial mass. Incense-cedar had the slowest decomposition, losing about 35% of initial mass in the same period. Small roots lost 11-35% of initial dry weight among 8 species in 2 years. For other class sizes, 10% or less of the initial mass was lost in 2 years. Initial substrate quality indices could be used to predict the decomposition rate-constant (k) of fine and small roots. For all fine roots, lignin-cellulose index (LCI) and lignin-phe nols:N together were the best predictor. In small roots, the phenols:N ratio was the best predictor. Soil nitrogen availability had no direct influences on woody root decomposition despite a 5-fold difference between sites. Decomposing roots, especially fine roots, could be an important nitrogen source with as much as 70 Kg/ha/year of nitrogen released from dead roots after catastrophic disturbances (e.g., clear-cut, forest fire) in Douglas-fir old-growth forests.

Whether spatial patterns of adult populations are determined primarily by settlement or post-settlement processes has prompted many recent studies. However, few studies consider fine scale differences in settlement of My tilus spp., even though population dynamics of the adults are the basis of key theory. Using larval collectors, wave dynanometers, laser survey sta tions, and GIS analysis, we compared patterns of settlement of Mytilus spp to wave exposure, topography, and adult population structure in Barkeley Sound, British Columbia and Santa Catalina Island, California. Three-di mensional GIS representations with fine scale resolution (l-4m) were de veloped by extensive surveying and mass sampling efforts. Comparison of larval settlement and adult distribution patterns show strong differences between M. californianus and M. "edulis morph" (M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis). Settlement of M. californianus primarily occurred within the region of adult mussels in areas of high wave exposure, whereas M. "edulis morph" settled both within and outside regions of adult populations over the entire gradient of wave exposures. CHESSON, P.1 and B. A.

The importance of coupled variable recruitment and density dependence in the coexistence of coral reef fishes. Coral reef fishes are known for their highly variable recruitment rates. Also, there is increasing evidence that density dependence may occur at a variety of stages in the life cycle, including mortality in early settlement, and growth of adults. These features were incorporated in a metapopulation model of reef fish communities, which showed that spatial and temporal variation in recruitment rates may strongly promote species coexistence when several conditions were satisfied. First, species should have different spatio-temporal patterns of recruitment so that the ratios of the recruitment rates of different species vary in space or time. Second, density dependence must be multispecies with both conspecific and heterospecific densities lim iting population growth. Third, coupling between recruitment and density dependence must occur in the sense that density dependence must more strongly limit local population growth when local recruitment is high. Co existence then occured even though species may differ, up to some maxi mum amount, in their fitnesses averaged over all environmental conditions. The maximum average fitness difference compatible with coexistence mea sured the strength by which coexistence was promoted. The strength of coexistence increased with the strength of the coupling between recruitment and density dependence. Moreover, the contribution of any stage in the life cycle to coexistence was diminished by density dependence at prior stages because the coupling of recruitment with density dependence at that stage was diminished by density dependence at prior stages. Density dependence in growth and reproduction may be poorly coupled with recruitment vari ation and therefore may only weakly affect species coexistence. An im portant exception was when there were large differences between average recruitment levels at different sites, in which case strong coupling between recruitment and density-dependent growth and reproduction developed over time, strongly promoting coexistence. This work emphasizes that recruit ment limitation and density dependence should not be treated as alteruative explanations for community structure. The interaction between the two is the dominant feature of coexistence in this model. CHICK, J. H.' and J. C.

Two important features of freshwater marshes in the Everglades have not been thoroughly researched. First, a lack of information about large-pisciv orous fishes has led to dichotomous descriptions of their importance, from suggestions that they control population growth of small fishes to sugges tions that they are too rare to be ecologically important. Second, Everglades marshes support an unusually large standing stock of periphyton, often manifested in a calcareous floating mat. Interactions between grazers and periphyton are complex because nutrient regeneration by omnivores can stimulates algal growth and physical features of mature periphyton mats can impede grazing. We conducted caging experiments to clarify the role of large-piscivorous and small-omnivorous fishes in the Everglades food web. Closed treatments demonstrated that mosquitofish, the numerically dominant small-omnivorous fish, significantly reduced recruitment of ma croinvertebrates, but had no significant net effects on periphyton. We also used open and refuge treatments to examine effects of large-piscivorous fishes, and found significantly greater use of the refuge treatment by small fishes, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates. Greater abundance of grazers in the refuge treatment significantly reduced new growth of epiphytic algae, but did not affect mature periphyton mats. Our experiments suggest large fishes in the Everglades may be abundant enough to at least influence habitat selection by prey taxa. Additionally, patterns of grazer effects sug gest physical features of mature periphyton mats that impede grazing may be critical to food web interactions in this system. CHIU, C., Y. CHIU and J. CHEN. Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan. Dynamics of soil microbial biomass C and N of sub-alpine forest and grassland ecosystems in central Taiwan. The soil microbial biomass in humid sub-alpine ecosystems in a subtropical region of Taiwan, was characterized. The major study was conducted in central Taiwan, which has an elevation of 2700 m. The climate is temperate mountainous with a mean annual precipitation of 3600 mm and a temper ature of 8.80XC, respectively. Microbial C and N were assessed using the chloroform fumigation-extraction method. The microbial C in grassland and forest sites ranged from 57 to 767 mg C kg-' soil in the lower mineral soil horizons, and 1465 to 3867 mg C kg-1 soil in the humus and A hori zons. Equivalent values for microbial N were 12.9 to 114.9 mg N kg-' soil in the mineral soil, and 107 to 926 mg N kg- soil in the surface soils. Microbial biomass C represented 1.4-3.8%, 1.0-4.2% and 0.3-2.5% of the organic C in the surface soils of grassland, transition zone and native Tsuga forest, respectively, whereas the microbial N as the percentage of total soil N comprised 6.2-15.7%, 5.3-18.0% and 2.6-11.1%, respectively. There was a close linear relationship between microbial biomass C and N. Ratios of microbial biomass C to N were remarkably consistent both within and between soils. The ratios were 3.82 for grassland, 3.15 for transition zone and 4.06 for Tsuga forest with an overall mean C/N ratio of 3.64 (r2=0.73). 72 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="34">CHOAT, B.,12 J.

Hydraulic ar chitecture of seasonally dry rainforest tree species of differing leaf phe nology from North Queensland, Australia. Dry rainforest communities exist as scattered patches within the regionally dominant sclerophylVsavanna vegetation of tropical northern Australia. This landscape is exposed to a distinct wet/dry season pattern and thus a large variation in water availability and evaporative demand. We investi gated how variations in hydraulic architecture influence vulnerability to embolism and the ability to survive seasonal drought in tree species of differing leaf phenology. Hydraulic architecture was examined in two ev ergreen species, Alphitonia excelsa and Austromyrtus bidwillii, and two deciduous species, Brachychiton australe and Cochlospermum gillivraei, growing naturally in a dry rainforest in North Queensland. B. australe and C. gillivraei had significantly wider vessels than the two evergreen species (mean vessel diameters of 176.1 ,um ? 3.9 and 120 jim + 4. 1, respec tively). There was also a significant difference in vessel diameter between the two evergreen species with values averaging 27.2 ,um ? 0.4 in A. bidwillii and 49.7 jim ? 0.7 in A. excelsa. Intervessel pit membranes were examined using SEM. Diameters of intervessel pit membranes were greater in deciduous, averaging 5.4 jm ? 0.2 in B. australe and 7.3 jim ? 0.4 in C. gillivraei, than in evergreen species, averaging 3.2 jLm ? 0.1 in A. bidwillii and 3.5 jm ? 0.4 in A. excelsa; however, pit membrane pores could not be detected to a resolution of 30 nm. Measurements of hydraulic conductivity revealed that the deciduous species were vulnerable to em bolism at higher xylem 4' than evergreen species. The evergreen species regularly experience T &lt; -4.0 MPa during the dry season, while the de ciduous species lost their leaves once the daily minimum declines to values of approximately -2.0 MPa. These results indicate that for the species stud ies, hydraulic architecture and leaf phenology are part of an integrated response to seasonal drought. CHOI, Y. D. Purdue University Calumet, Hammond, IN 46323. Processes of wetland degradation in northwestern Indiana. Processes of wetland degradation were investigated in the basins of Turkey Creek and Little Calumet River in the highly urbanized northwestern In diana. Our vegetation analysis from 113 degraded wetland sites, consist of 357 polygons in the US Army Corps of Engineer's GIS database, suggests two potential vegetation processes of wetland degradation. Flooding con ditions of the wetlands that were located near established residential or high ways (e.g., residential storm water retention ponds or roadside de pressions that were inundated by runoff) facilitated significant expansion of Typha angustifolia . Such Typha dominated wetlands were invaded by Phragmites communis and Lythrum salicaria, and then developed to shrub carrs with Salix interia, S nigra, Cornus spp., and Populus deltoides . Meanwhile, drained or filled wetlands (mostly the ones near old fields and newly developing residential subdivisions) were typically dominated by Phalaris arundinacea , and followed by Solidago spp. and Urtica spp. These dried wetlands then succeeded to woodlands with Populus deltoides and Fraxinus americana. Despite the excessive invasion of "undesirable" native or alien species, most wetlands still possess a few important hydro logical and biogeochemical functions such as retention of storm water, and removal and transformation of nutrients, and physical filtration of sedi ments.

Allometric relationship between tree diameter and total above ground biomass may be more species independent than previously thought. Biomass equations are required to calculate carbon budget from inventory data for terrestrial forests. Although numerous species-specific equations exist, there are many gaps and confusing overlaps. This study examines biomass equations for North American pine, Pinus, species to seek patterns for generalization. A literature search found 28 diameter-based biomass equations for pine species in U.S. and Canada. Equations were compared by generating "pseudo" biomass data from the equations at 5-cm intervals for the diameter (dbh) range of original data. Comparison of data trends among equations showed little species differentiation. For example, three very different pine species (P. teada, P. edulis, and P. contorta) from the southeastern, southwestern, and northwestern corners of North America showed a similar relationship between dbh and corresponding amount of biomass. These and all other pine equations fell within a confidence interval that spanned 25 to 30% of predicted values for a generalized pine equation. Why this similar relationship in different species? Perhaps a tree's diameter is just big enough to support the mass above it. Obviously, trees distribute biomass very differently among component parts (crowns, branches, fo liages, stem taper, etc.) in response to genera, genetics, site, environment, and competition. However, the sum total of components may balance out to a fairly uniform dbh-to-above ground biomass relationship for many species. CHONG, G. W.,12 T. J. STOHLGREN'2 and S.

From 1995 through 1998, 104 Modified-Whittaker plots (20 m by 50 m) were established in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Of those plots, 32 were established in aspen stands identified from aerial photos (1987, color; 1:15840 scale). We identified 188 vascular plant species that were unique to aspen plots. The remaining 72 plots combined contained 264 unique species. The slope of the mean species-area curve for the aspen vegetation type was the steepest of the nine vegetation types sampled (num ber of species = 23.8(log(area)) - 10.8, R2 = 0.92). Although aspen stands cover a small proportion of Rocky Mountain National Park (2% based on one Park map), they contribute a disproportionate amount to plant species richness. Aspen plots also contained the greatest number of butterfly spe cies. However, aspen plots contained 38 of the 42 non-native species iden tified in all plots. Research throughout the Rocky Mountain Region has found a similar trend: Hot-spots of native plant diversity are being invaded by non-native plant species. Thus, resource managers must consider the effects of management choices on understory species composition as well as on the aspen stands themselves. CHOQUENOT, D. and W. RUSCOE. Landcare Research New Zealand, Lincoln, New Zealand. Mouse population eruptions in New Zealand forests: The role of population density and seedfall. Eruptive mouse populations provide an opportunity to test ideas about how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact to limit small mammal populations. We analysed 25 years of mouse density and autumn beech seedfall data from a mosaic forest in New Zealand consisting of beech and podocarp/ broadleaf stands, to test the effect mouse density and seedfall had on rates of increase (r) for an eruptive mouse population. For transitions from au tumn to winter and winter to spring, r was related to the magnitude of seedfall and mouse density. For transitions from spring to summer and summer to autumn, r was related to mouse density alone. The strong den sity-dependence we observed in r for this population was confirmed using PBLR analysis. Density-dependence could reflect the influence of intrinsic social factors, intraspecific competition for food, or the effects of parasites, diseases or predators. While there are currently insufficient data to differ entiate between these factors, limited data on mouse offtake by stoats is consistent with a role of predation. Mouse density was more volatile in beech forest than in podocarp/broadleaf forest, maximum rates of increase and decrease both being greater in the former. This volatility led to densities being higher in podocarp/broadleaf stands when overall density was low, and higher in beech stands when overall density was high. Collectively, these results suggest that between eruptions, mice persist in podocarp/ broadleaf stands, erupting in adjacent beech stands when autumn seedfall is sufficient to prolong winter reproduction and elevate survival.

The Savanna ecosystem model was used to examine the effects of different livestock intensities on the Mongolian Steppe to approach the question of sustainability and resilience. Although it is well determined that extreme Oral Presentation Abstracts 73</page><page sequence="35">overgrazing can lead to degradation in this region, there is uncertainty in which livestock intensities and management strategies are appropriate. Sa vanna is a spatially explicit, dynamic, process-oriented model that simulates ecosystem processes at local and regional scales. We used Savanna to focus on spatial and temporal climate, vegetation, and ungulate grazing dynamics. Savanna was run with 12 different livestock intensities (au/kmi2) to examine grazing effects on vegetation, including primary production, vegetation composition, and root biomass. Simulations were run for 100 years in length: 50 years to examine sustainability and 50 years to examine resil ience of the system. Results show a grazing intensity (l-g/u; g = biomass in grazed area, u = biomass in ungrazed area) of 0.40 is sustainable for this particular system. Grazing intensity above this level resulted in de creased primary production and root biomass. This region was resilient to grazing up to an intensity of 0.40. Higher intensities resulted in a change in vegetation composition: A decrease in herbaceous biomass and an in crease in shrub biomass; consequently the system was unable to return its original composition.

Envi ronmental, developmental, and genetic constraints on the induction of trypsin inhibitor activity in Brassica species. Induced chemical defenses are thought to be important determinants of plant resistance to natural enemies in the field and to represent a form of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. However, many factors can constrain the induction of defense, placing limits on the benefits of inducibility and pre venting perfect phenotype-environment matching. We investigated the ef fect of several environmental, developmental, and genetic factors on the wound-inducibility of trypsin inhibitor activity in three Brassica species. In Brassica napus, we found that plant genotype, age, and wound location significantly influenced inhibitor induction by mechanical wounding. In creased plant density and reduced nutrient availability were found to be important environmental constraints on wound-induction, and it appears that induction is constrained by these factors independently of their effects on growth or total protein synthesis. In turn, competition with weeds sig nificantly increased herbivory on B. napus plants in the field. Using a crossing design, we found some evidence of variation in inhibitor levels induced by caterpillar feeding among families of Brassica rapa from a wild population, and found large temporal block effects on inhibitor pro duction. Finally, maternal half-sib families of Brassica kaber collected from a wild population exhibited some evidence of variation in wound inducibility of inhibitors and inhibitor levels were affected by nutrient availability. Overall, these results indicate that the wound-inducibility of trypsin inhibitors in Brassica species may have a genetic basis, and that the degree of inducibility is sensitive to environmental conditions. Such factors can significantly influence the degree of matching between a de fensive phenotype and a selective environment. CIVILLE, J. C. University of California Davis CA 95616 USA. Spartina alterniflora: Tracking and predicting the spread of an intertidal inva sive in Willapa Bay. Spartina alterniflora Loisel., (smooth cordgrass), is a valuable native com ponent of Atlantic and Gulf Coast estuaries. It was likely introduced into Willapa Bay, a Pacific Coast estuary, near the turn of the twentieth century. The initial colonies remained at low levels for decades before gaining the attention of local oyster growers, biologists and wildlife refuge managers in the 1970s; subsequent explosive growth and loss of migratory shorebird feeding grounds has lead to its designation as a noxious plant and envi ronmental emergency by the Washington State legislature. A textbook ex ample of clonal growth, S. alterniflora forms visually striking arrays of circular patches merging into meadows on otherwise open tideflats. Despite the ease with which the human eye detects the progressive spread of the invasion, it is difficult to assess the distribution and spread rate of cordgrass on an ecosystem level. This can largely be attributed to the Bay's size and the nature of the invaded habitat: 360 km2 at mean high tide, with over 190 km2 of soft mud tideflats exposed at mean low tide. Incorporating demographic data into Integrated Pest Management (1PM) strategies at eco system levels is necessary to effectively direct control and eradication ef forts. Low altitude color infra-red photographs (1:6000) were acquired along standardized flight lines in 1994 and 1997. These were digitally scanned, then georeferenced with digital orthophotos and imported into image analysis and a geographic information system for analysis. The 1994 and 1997 data indicate that nearly 13 km2 of S. alterniflora is spread over 53 km2 of tideflats, increasing by as much as 300 and 400 percent in shallow areas of the Bay. As part of a recent initiative to incorporate bio logical control into cordgrass IPM, this analysis of spatial distribution and growth trends will be used to determine the most appropriate control meth ods for different ages and locations of cordgrass populations.

Assessing the spatial and temporal variation in below ground carbon allocation in an old-growth neotropical rain forest. Since April 1998, we have estimated belowground carbon allocation as part of a cross-scale analysis of the carbon stocks and fluxes in a lowland tropical rain forest (La Selva Biological Station, N.E. Costa Rica). To eval uate landscape-scale edaphic variation of the carbon cycle, replicated 0.5 ha plots were established in old growth on the dominant soil types: Incep tisols (old alluvial terraces), and the less fertile Ultisols (highly weathered residual soils). In three plots per soil type, fine litterfall and soil respiration have been measured concurrently. Biweekly, fine litterfall is collected in nine 0.25 m2 traps per plot and soil CO2 efflux is measured with an infrared gas analyzer in 8 permanent soil chambers per plot. We used the C-balance method to estimate the total belowground carbon allocation by the vege tation in the plots (TBCA). Over the first complete measurement year, estimated TBCA was substantial on all plots (5.7-10.8 Mg C/ha/yr). Mean estimated TBCA was 41% higher on the poorer soils (9.2 Mg C/ha/yr for the Ultisols, compared to 6.6 Mg/ha/yr on the Inceptisols), in line with the higher fine root stocks we have found on these soils. Estimated TBCA substantially varied between years for most plots (mean inter-year change of 24% for the 6-month period April-September in the first two years). These data indicate considerable spatio-temporal variation in carbon dy namics within terra firme tropical rain forest. CLARK, K. L.,' H. L. GHOLZI and M. CASTRO.2 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA; 2University of Maryland. Partitioning car bon fluxes during ecosystem develoment following a disturbance. Respiration is the largest carbon flux from terrestrial ecosystems after gross primary production (GPP), with the difference between them termed net ecosystem production (NEP). We obtained estimates of NEP and ecosystem respiration using eddy covariance for a chronosequence of Pinus elliottii plantations in north-central Florida: A recent clearcut, a mid-rotation (10 yr-old) stand, and a mature (24-yr-old) stand. We also measured soil res piration in static chambers at all three sites. NEP and ecosystem respiration was estimated at -393 and 1040 g C m-2 yr-1 during the first year following clearcutting (1998). After three years, NEP was again positive. NEP and ecosystem respiration reached 645 and 1659 g C m-2 yrl at the mid-rotation stand, and 670 and 2108 g C m-2 yr-I at the mature stand. The proportion of ecosystem respiration attributable to belowground processes decreased over time, from more than 95 % at the clearcut to less than 60% at the mature stand. GPP was estimated at 647, 2304, and 2778 g C m-2 yrl at the clearcut, mid-rotation, and mature stands, respectively, and was related to the increases in leaf area and respiring biomass. The carbon dynamics of these intensively managed plantations contrast highly to those of natural ecosystems in this landscape. CLARK, D. B.,' D. A. CLARK,' S. F. OBERBAUER2 and E.

We used a stratified random 74 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="36">block design to site 18 0.5 ha plots in old-growth tropical rain forest (TRF) in Costa Rica in three contrasting conditions: Flat relatively fertile sites (Inceptisols), flat infertile sites (Ultisols), and steeply sloping infertile sites (Ultisols). Number of stems &gt;10 cm diameter was significantly higher in steep infertile plots (552/ha) than in the flat fertile sites (410/ha). Death rates over the period 1997-1999 varied an order of magnitude among plots, from 0.7 to 10.8%/yr. Contrary to our a priori hypotheses, plots on more fertile soils had the lowest death rates (2.3%/yr), and steeply sloping plots were intermediate in mortality (3.2%/yr); flat infertile plots averaged 5.0% mortality/yr. Patchy multi-tree blowdowns contributed to the substantial variance in death rate among plots. Overall, one-third of tree deaths were directly caused by another tree falling on them. The all-stems death rate was 3.6%/yr, one of the highest reported for an old-growth TRE It is too early in this long-term study to identify the cause(s) for this high rate, but possible factors include El Nifno events, long-term warming trends, or a demographic effect due to short measurement intervals. Overall these data show that there is substantial intra-landscape variance in the structure and dynamics of terra firme tropical forests, and that this variation is related to gradients in soil and topographic conditions.

Drought cycles and prairie responses with past aridity in the northern Plains. Global warming may increase aridity in continental interiors, such as the Great Plains in North America. Because ecosystem response depends on the uncertain seasonal distribution of rainfall and fire, we have limited ability to anticipate ecosystem responses to future global warming. To de termine potential sensitivity of mixed-grass prairie to conditions more arid than today we used paleoecological methods to analyze responses to arid conditions 7000 yr ago. Stratified sediments from Kettle Lake, ND showed well-defined 80 to 100 yr cycles of alternately arid and humid conditions that affected all ecosystem indicators we analyzed from sediment geochem isty, fossil pollen, and charcoal. As opposed to forested communities, the herbaceous grassland vegetation of the Great Plains is responsive to high frequency variations in precipitation, at annual to decadal scales, both in terms of biomass and species composition. Prairie fires are biomass depen dent, and fossil charcoal is a proxy for biomass. During each arid phase, increased erosion caused quartz to increase from 10 to 40%. Grass pollen and charcoal were low during arid phases (&lt; 10% and &lt; 1 mm2cm-2yr', respectively) and then increased with declining quartz and gypsum as a result of increased production of grasses and, thus, fuels. Z13C of terrestrial organic matter showed that, although both C3 and C4 grasses responded to drought cycles, a lasting shift to increased C3 grasses occurred during one drought cycle. The diatom data indicate that changes in lake level and lakewater salinity are not always coupled to the changes in the terrestrial record and thus suggest that the hydrologic system has different thresholds and response times. Taken together, our results indicate that increased arid ity need not produce uniformly dry conditions, but rather can produce periodic variation at time scales (102 yr) not apparent from contemporary climate ecords. Increased erosion and great reduction of grass pollen and charcoal during each arid phase suggests high ecosystem sensitivity to cli mate variation. CLEIN, J.,' MCGUIRE,' X. ZHANG,' D.

The role of nitrogen dynamics in modeling historical and projected carbon balance of mature black spruce ecosystems across North America: Comparisons with CO2 fluxes measured in the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). We used the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) to evaluate the role N dynamics play in influencing the spatial and temporal responses of C dy namics in black spruce ecosystems to historical and projected climate var iability in North America. First, we developed black spruce parameteriza tions for versions of the model in which C and N dynamics were coupled and uncoupled. We evaluated the performance of these parameterizations at two eddy correlation tower sites in black spruce stands by comparing field-based C fluxes to simulated C fluxes. Monthly estimates of GPP and RESP for the coupled and uncoupled simulations were highly correlated with the field-based estimates (R2 = 0.90). The correlations between field based and simulated monthly NEP were lower for both tower sites as com pared to the correlations for GPP and RESP (R2 between 0.3 and 0.6). Next, we used a global-based climatology to simulate historical and pro jected C dynamics from 1900 to 2100 with both parameterizations of TEM at one of the tower sites. There was greater inter-annual variability in NPP simulated by the uncoupled parameterization, which led to substantial dif ferences in inter-annual variability in NEP between the parameterizations. Additioanlly, heterotrophic respiration increased at a faster rate in the un coupled simulation during the projected period, causing more C storage. These responses were the result of different responses of the parameteri zations to changes in CO2 and climate. Across the range of North American black spruce ecosystems, the range of simulated decadal changes in C storage was greater for the uncoupled parameterization than for the coupled parameterization. Analysis of the spatial variability in decadal responses of C dynamics revealed that C fluxes simulated by both parameterizations have different sensitivities to climate and that the climate sensitivities of the fluxes change with time. The results of this study suggest that uncer tainties can be reduced through studies focused on elucidating the role of C and N interactions in the response of black spruce ecosystems to manip ulations of atmospheric CO2 and climate and establishment of a network of continuous, long-term measurements of C dynamics across the range of mature black spruce ecosystems in North America.

The nocturnal and crepuscular ecology of a diurnal monkey, Colobus guer eza, in the Kakamega forest, Kenya. Land use changes by humans threatens many species worldwide as habitat is lost through degradation and fragmentation. Time-delays in the response of species to these changes may result in several-generations elapsing be fore the consequences of fragmentation are realized. Furthermore, individ ual species utilize ecological resources on different spatial and temporal scales within a landscape. These interactive effects of species and ecolog ical resources make predictions about population decline due to fragmen tation difficult and highly variable from species to species. Guerezas utilize specific trees in their home range as sleeping trees, and spend over half of their time in these trees. This study supports earlier findings that guerezas sleep in or near important feeding trees away from other groups and that guerezas sleep only in tall trees that allow the greatest predator protection. This study investigated the ecological characteristics of sleeping and feed ing trees in relation to the home range of two neighboring groups of guer ezas. Guerezas display great variability in the range of tree species, indi vidual trees and tree morphology that they utilize for feeding. The character of their sleeping trees was more constrained; most of the time they used a few preferred species. Further, they sleep in specific individual trees that allow superior predator avoidance. Groups of guerezas in a study site in the Kakamega Forest were found to decline in number from 18 groups in 1992 to 12 groups in 1998. The westem half of the study site did not show a decline in groups: This area has more human foot traffic which might reduce predation levels. The complete loss of the Kakamega Forest can be predicted to occur in 2031 if clearing continues at its historical rate. Given that the character of sleeping trees is highly constrained and may influence guerezas' ability to avoid predators, sleeping trees are an important eco logical resource to consider in order to conserve guereza populations in this increasingly degraded forest.

Linkages between the soil microbial community and biogeochemical cycling in a tropical rainforest forest of Costa Rica: The effects of soil type and land use history. Deforestation and conversion of land to pasture or crops in tropical rain forest ecosystems can cause wholesale alterations to ecosystem structure and function, and in particular, can lead to fundamental changes in nutrient Oral Presentation Abstracts 75</page><page sequence="37">cycling. Evidence suggests that land conversion may lead to substantial decreases in plant-available phosphorus (P), the probable limiting element in tropical ecosystems. However, the mechanism behind such losses is not well known. One strong possibility is that land transformation disrupts the structure and activity of soil microorganisms, which are the principal agents of decomposition, and play a central role in nutrient cycling. We studied the magnitude and functional composition of the soil microbial community in a matrix of forest and pasture sites on different soil types on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica. In sites characterized by highly weathered, nutri ent-poor ultisols, microbial biomass C and N in the oldest pasture sites (20 yr.) was less than half of that in young (5 yr.) pasture sites and undisturbed forest sites. In addition, ecophysiological analyses suggested that the mi crobial community in both the old pasture and forest sites were not carbon limited, but were limited by some other nutrient. Conversely, the young pasture site was strongly carbon limited. We believe that land conversion may temporarily release the microbial community in young pasture sites from P limitation, and that as labile-P levels decline with pasture age, the microbial community again becomes P limited. In contrast to the ultisols, sites on nutrient-rich alluvial mollisols had relatively similar microbial bio mass C and N, and were strongly carbon limited, showing no sign of P (or other nutrient) limitation. These data suggest strong linkages between the soil microbial community and biogeochemical cycling in both natural and managed ecosystems in the humid tropics. CLEVERLY, J. R.,' J. R. THIBAULT,1 J.

Evapotranspiration from Middle Rio Grande (New Mexico) riparian ecosystems: The roles of flooding and community composition. Water depletion from rivers in arid and semi-arid regions is a major con cern. Along the Middle Rio Grande, spring flooding promotes decompo sition and nutrient cycling, as well as the establishment of native species such as Populus deltoides subsp. wislizenii, the Rio Grande Cottonwood. To investigate the roles of flooding and species composition on evapotrans piration, we used a set of 4 3-dimensional eddy covariance systems to quantify the roles of the invasion of saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) and flooding management on seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) from a 150 km stretch of the Middle Rio Grande. Baseline ET values were less than 0.2 mm day-' preceding spring greening. ET increased to a peak of 5.0 mm day-' at the T. ramosissima unflooded site, while ET rates peaked near 10.0 mm day-' in the higher density T. ramosissima flooded stand. These ET rates reflected mid-range ET estimates from other studies of saltcedar. Stand density, species composition, and flooding along the length of the river are important considerations in understanding ET-related depletion of water resources and strategies for restoring the riparian corridor to pre-Tamarix conditions.

Retention forestry, in contrast to clear-cut harvesting, places seedlings in the regenerating stand in close proximity to residual unharvested trees. The spatial effects of residual trees on seedlings have not been well investigated. In addition to effects from shading and competition for soil resources, seedlings near residual trees could be exposed to a diverse inoculation source of ectomycorrhizal fungi from the residual trees' roots. To investi gate this effect, Douglas-fir seedlings were planted "near" (2-6 m) and "far" (&gt; 16 m) from residual trees in three recently harvested green-tree retention units on the Cedar and Green River watersheds in the western foothills of the Cascade mountain range in Washington state, USA. Over a period of two growing seasons, residual tree roots and seedling roots were sampled and ectomycorrhizal root tips were sorted and classified based on morpho logical characteristics. Seedling height and diameter growth were recorded at the end of each growing season. At two of the three sites, "far" seedlings were taller, but at all sites, "far" seedlings had a slightly lower root biomass, and the total seedling biomass was similar in "near" and "far" seedlings. Ectomycorrhizal abundance and diversity were higher for seedlings planted near residual trees. Ectomycorrhizas of the residual trees were more similar to those of "near" seedlings than those of "far" seedlings. Residual trees appear to influence seedling mycorrhizas, root development, and height growth at a fine spatial scale. COE, M. T and J. A. FOLEY.

An integrated biosphere model (IBIS) and a hydrological routing algorithm (HYDRA) were used in conjunction to simulate the monthly mean river discharge and surface water area within the Lake Chad Basin of northem Africa. A series of simulations investigated the impact of climate changes and human water use on the water balance of the Lake Chad Basin in the last 50 years. IBIS and HYDRA were applied to the climate of the last 50 years using monthly climate data from the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University. IBIS calculates the monthly mean surface and sub-sur face runoff at 0.5 degree horizontal resolution from the CRU05 forcing. HYDRA utilizes the IBIS generated runoff to calculate the mean monthly river discharge and lake and wetland volume, area, and level at a 5' (about 10 km by 10 km at the equator) horizontal resolution. Two simulations were performed; one with no irrigation and a second in which estimates of irrigation losses were removed from the major river systems. For the period 1953-1979 the modeled hydrology of the basin was in good agreement with the available observations when irrigation was not included. For ex ample, the coefficient of correlation (r2) between the simulated and ob served level of Lake Chad for the 288 months of available observations was 0.93. The results of the simulation with irrigation suggested that human water use has had only a small impact on the level and area of surface waters in the period 1953-1979. For the period 1983-1994 water use for irrigation increased four-fold compared to the period 1953-1979. The sim ulated average discharge for the decade 1985-1994, of 16 km3/yr, agreed well with the observed estimate of 17 km3/yr. A comparison of the simu lated monthly mean surface water area, with and without irrigation, sug gests that human water use has accounted for roughly 50% of the observed change in lake area since the 1970s. This study illustrates the importance of considering human activities on water resources, even in very large hydrologic systems. COLE, L., 1,2 R. D.

Climate change effects on enchytraeid worms (Oli gochaeta) and C release in tundra soils. It is becoming increasingly apparent that ecosystem responses to climate change may be regulated by below-ground feedback processes, which are mediated by responses of soil biota to atmospheric CO2 enrichment and warming. This study examined the response of soil fauna and their inter actions with microbes to climate change (soil warming), and the conse quences of this for decomposition and nutrient cycling processes in organic tundra soils. Enchytraeid worms (Oligochaeta) were the dominant soil fau na of these tundra soils, with a single species Cognettia sphagnetorum (Vedj.) comprising 75% of the below-ground biomass. Field studies re vealed that enchytraeid densities were correlated to soil temperature, and their vertical distribution was related to soil moisture status. A series of microcosm studies were carried out showing that when at field densities, enchytraeids significantly increased microbial respiration (by 35%) and the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (by 94%) from the surface litter of tundra soils. Enchytraeids had no effect on the growth and nutrition of the upland grass species F. ovina (L.) since grazing of the microbes by enchytraeids may have enhanced their ability to sequester N and P, despite a reduction in microbial biomass (by 23%, as total PLFA). These results suggest that enchytraeids indirectly drive the processes of decomposition and nutrient mineralization, and hence plant nutrient availability, through their interactions with the soil microbial community. A second experiment examined the effects of soil warming (to 50 C above current mean summer temperatures) and revealed a reduced functional role of enchytraeids in regards to their influence on C mineralization, suggesting future warming may reduce their biological contribution to C mineralization. However, soil warming enhanced nutrient uptake by F. ovina, despite the loss of the beneficial role of enchytraeids for plant nutrient availability and acquisition, 76 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="38">suggesting that increased primary production in these ecosystems in re sponse to future warming, may maintain the role of these soils as terrestrial C stores.

Fine-root production, turnover and soil CO2 ef flux in pine and poplar plantations. A three-year study in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and hybrid poplar (Populus tristis X P. balsamifera cv 'Tristis no. 1') plantations was un dertaken to compare belowground root dynamics. We measured fine-root production, turnover and standing crop, as well as soil CO2 efflux. During the course of the experiment, pine fine-root production was 2.9% that of poplar; 85 pine roots were observed in minirhizotron tubes compared to 4088 for poplar. Live-root density oscillated seasonally for both species with late winter minimum and autumnal maximum. Poplar produced a con stant maximum amount of live-root length on minirhizotron surfaces within the first growing season, but pine fine roots continued to reach higher maximum length on the minirhizotron surface for the next three growing seasons. Median fine-root longevity was 291 days for pine roots compared with 149 for poplar roots. Fine-root longevity increased with depth in the soil and was greater for roots with initial diameter &gt;0.5 mm. Within the first 100 days following initial appearance, 22% of the pine roots disap peared and 38% of the poplar roots disappeared. The probability of poplar root death from late February to May was more than three times that of any other season, regardless of root age. Soil CO2 efflux was greater in pine despite greater poplar root production and live-root length. Pine and poplar appear to have very different strategies of root deployment, which may impact soil resource accumulation. COLLINS, R. J. and W. P. CARSON. University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA. The role of fire, deer herbivory and canopy gaps on tree species composition in eastern deciduous forests: Implications for succession theory. Successional theories and models for second growth eastern deciduous for ests predict that species composition should shift over time from pioneer, shade-intolerant species to late-successional shade-tolerant species. Suc cession models based solely on shade tolerance fail to predict changes occurring in many eastern forests. Why does successional theory not fit common patterns? Probably because other factors that are as important as shade tolerance come into play. To understand the mechanisms that control forest composition and succession, we are testing the roles of fire, deer herbivory and canopy gaps on the growth and survival of a 35 tree species at the Westvaco Research Forest in northeastern West Virginia. We have established 64, 400 m2 subplots where we have permanently tagged, iden tified and measured nearly 17,000 seedlings, saplings and adults. We have experimentally manipulated fire, browsing by deer, and canopy gap for mation in these plots in a factorial design. Here, we report the first year post treatment results. Sprouts on standing dead trees (a major regeneration mechanism the region) were three times taller inside fences compared to spouts in unfenced plots. Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) seedling height increased by 60% in fenced gaps and decreased by 20% in unfenced gaps (P&lt; 0.05). Black cherry (Prunus serotina) showed the same pattern (P&lt; 0.05). Fires promoted grape vine (Vitis spp. ) and pin cherry (Prunus pen sylvanica) germination. The hottest fires topkilled 60-100% of the saplings. These results show that deer mask the effects of canopy gaps and fires can control understory species composition. Our overall goal is to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that, along with shade tolerance, control forest tree species composition and succession. COLLINS, S. L.' and S. M.

Effects of canopy removal on local and regional patterns of distribution and abundance. The distribution of species among sites and abundance of species within sites results from the interaction between local and regional processes. We analyzed the effect of dominance (a local process) by core species on the local and regional distribution and abundance of species in tallgrass prairie. By removing little bluestem, a core species, in replicated 5 by 10 m areas, we demonstrated that core species depress abundance of satellite species at the local scale. At larger scales, grazing by ungulates also reduces abun dance of core species. At the regional scale, species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed prairie. The increase in satellite species observed at the local scale, however, was not reflected at the regional scale. Rather, the pattern of proportion of sites occupied by species in grazed vegetation was similar to patterns in ungrazed prairie. In addition, there were no differences in the relationship between number of sites occupied and average abundance of each species between grazed and ungrazed veg etation. These results suggest that local scale interactions affect local dis tribution and abundance, but these patterns disappear at regional scales. CONDIT, R. Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, 34002, USA. Growth rate as a function of diameter in tropical trees: Data from the BCI large forest plot. Growth rate was calculated for &gt; 200000 trees in the 50 ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI). Shade-tolerant species invariably had low growth when stem diameter (dbh) was &lt; 4 cm, mostly &lt; 1 mm/yr. Growth rate increased with dbh, and leveled off (sometimes decreased) at between 3 and 12 mm/yr, depending on the species. Pioneer species had higher growth rates as saplings, so that growth was either independent of dbh or increased slightly with dbh. I tested models for predicting the relation between growth and dbh. Familiar growth models are based on the difference be tween photosynthesis and respiration. With both P and R modeled as power functions of dbh, this leads to a difference between two power functions: , where g is growth, s is dbh, and a-d are parameters. Unfortunately, this function could not be fit to growth data because the parameters are highly correlated (that is, there is not a unique solution for a given set of data). But I have sufficient data to estimate the allometric relationship between photosynthesis and dbh: Allometric functions for crown area vs. dbh, for tree height vs. dbh, and for light availability vs height. The first two were fit for 81 trees in the BCI plot, and the third is available from a canopy height census carried out every 5 m throughout the forest. The relation between photosynthesis and dbh was calculated by multiplying estimated crown area by light available at the estimated height, for a given dbh. This reduced the growth equation given above to 3 parameters, and these were estimated for the 81 species. This generated, for each, an estimate of the exponent d, relating whole-tree respiration to dbh. Finally, I attempted to test whether the onset of reproduction could be detected in the growth function, by fitting a model for growth rate in trees smaller than reproduc tive size, and then for trees larger than reproductive size; however, no consistent decline in growth around reproductive size could be detected.

Response of growth and nitrate re ductase activity in trees to elevated CO2 varies with mycorrhizal status. Plant responses to increased atmospheric CO2 partial pressure may depend on the ability to acquire nutrients including nitrogen (N). Mycorrhizae fa cilitate N acquisition and alter N assimilation, therefore, mycorrhizae may modulate plant response to elevated CO2. In this study we assessed how inoculation with the endomycorrhizae Glomus intraradices affected seed ling growth and nitrate reductase activity (NRA) in Acer saccharinum (Acsa), Fraxinus pennsylvanica (Frpe), and Ulmus americana (Ulam) grown at either ambient (-38 Pa) or elevated (-70 Pa) CO2. Total seedling growth was stimulated -25% by elevated CO2 in Acsa and Ulam regardless of mycorrhizal status. However, in Ulam the magnitude of the growth en hancement was less in mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal plants, a similar pattern was not observed in Acsa. Below-ground growth was stimulated by elevated CO2 in both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal seedlings of Acsa and Ulam. Total and below-ground growth of Frpe was unchanged by any treatment. Foliar NRA exceeded fine root NRA in all species re gardless of experimental treatment. Elevated CO2 depressed foliar NRA in Acsa (---50%) and Ulam (---30%). In Ulam, the negative effect of CO2 was reversed by a mycorrhizal stimulation of foliar NRA (--+40%). A similar response was not observed in Acsa where mycorrhizae reduced foliar NRA at ambient (-30%), but not at elevated CO2. Fine root NRA was enhanced --25% by elevated CO2 in both mycorrhizal treatments in Acsa. In Ulam, elevated CO2 increased fine root NRA (+46%) in non Oral Presentation Abstracts 77</page><page sequence="39">mycorrhizal seedlings, but depressed it (-38%) in mycorrhizal seedlings. Neither foliar or fine root NRA were affected by the treatments in Frpe. The results suggest that elevated CO2 stimulated growth, but depending on plant species, mycorrhizae may determine the magnitude of this stimula tion. Similarly, elevated CO2 may have opposing effects on foliar and fine root NRA depending on mycorrhizal status. Mycorrhizae may affect plant growth response to elevated CO2 through a variety of mechanisms includ ing changes in N acquisition and assimilation. COOK, S. James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia 4811. Local and regional scale determinants of lizard species diversity patterns. I tested the idea that local species richness was a subset of regional species richness by looking at tropical lizard assemblages at the local scale across habitat types and biogeographic regions in Australia's wet tropics. Levels of species richness at a local (one hectare) scale were found to be signifi cantly higher in eucalypt forest than adjacent rainforest. Using a combined approach of physiological and behavioural tests on individuals and data on regional species diversity and historical forest contractions it was estab lished that the present patterns of species diversity in the rainforest were originally established by extinction patterns due to rainforest contractions during the Pleistocene ice age. These patterns appear to have been main tained by the adaptive constraint of the thermal environment places on the remaining suite of species in the regional pool. Species diversity in eucalypt forest maintained a constant local level within differing regional pools, indicating local, ecological saturation. Thus it appears that while regional scale processes have created the current species patterns in this area, the patterns are being maintained by niche saturation in one habitat type (eu calypt) and adaptive constraint in the other (rainforest). Therefore it appears that in this system ecological and evolutionary processes are constraining species richness, but these two processes are operating to different degrees between habitat types.

Ground beetle community responses to experimental fire frequency. It has been well documented that changes in fire frequency have significant effects on several biotic groups on tallgrass prairies, including mammals, vascular plants and birds. This talk presents data from a three-year study at the Konza Prairie LTER site in eastern Kansas, where we have investi gated community responses to fire frequency in key groups of terrestrial arthropods, focusing on ground beetles, Coleoptera: Carabidae, and iso pods, Crustacea: Isopoda. Species distributions and abundances varied by season, three fire treatments, and by topographic variables within each fire regime. While there was some variation between replicates, spring-abun dant species generally preferred recently burned areas, while the few fall breeders preferred unburned areas. While total abundance of individuals varied between years for most species, high numbers of captures tended to occur in the same areas from year-to-year, and the relative abundances of different species remained similar. Overall, the numbers of species occu pying each fire treatment area were comparable, and the data are weakly consistent. COOK, A. C.,' L. J. HAINSWORTH,2 M. L. SOREY,3 W. C. EVANS3 and J. R.

Radiocarbon studies of plant leaves and tree rings from Mammoth Mountain, CA: A long-term re cord of magmatic CO2 release. Beginning in 1990, extensive tree mortality was observed at seven locations on the flanks of Mammoth Mountain, California. The species independent nature of the tree death was unprecedented and hinted at a cause other than the typical drought stress or pest infestation. In 1994, the cause of these tree kills was linked to the diffuse release of CO2 from beneath Mammoth Mountain. We evaluated the 14C signature in the annual rings of trees and other surrounding vegetation with two main purposes: (1) to track changes in the magnitude of magmatic CO2 emission over time, and (2) to determine the onset of magmatic CO2 emission at numerous sites on Mammoth Moun tain. The relative quantity of magmatic CO2 being released at a specific location is inferred from the extent of 14C deficiency in the plant material from areas of high flux relative to that being produced on other parts of the mountain where CO2 concentrations are ambient. This inference is pos sible due to the absence of 14C in magmatic CO2 as opposed to that of atmospheric CO2 which is on the order of 110 per ml. The onset of CO2 emission at the different areas of tree kill was determined to be in 1990, closely following the seismic events of 1989. At Horseshoe Lake, CO2 emission was found to have peaked in 1991 and to have subsequently declined by a factor of two through 1998. The tree-ring data also show that emissions of magmatic carbon from cold springs below the tree-kill areas occurred well before 1989. Trees located on the margins of the kill areas or otherwise away from zones of maximum gas discharge were found to be better integrators of magmatic CO2 emission than those located in the center of tree kills. In the interest of human safety on both large (vol canic hazard) and small scales (asphyxia hazard), changes in CO2 flux over time must be understood. COOMES, D. 12 and R. ALLEN.'

Growth and competition along environmental gra dients in New Zealand mountain beech forest. Theories about how plant competition varies along environmental gradients have largely been developed and tested in herbaceous communities. Their testing in forests has been constrained by the logistics of large-scale ma nipulations, the longer time scales involved, and the implications of com plex structural dynamics. In this paper, we quantify interaction strengths by measuring the mean growth response of trees to the natural death of neighbors. Our analyses are based on tree-diameter data collected 8 times over 19 years from permanently-marked plots. We compare 250 randomly located stands in a 9000-ha forest, within which mountain beech (Notho fagus solandri var. cliffortioides ) is the only tree species across a wide range of environmental conditions. In general, the best-fitting index of com petition was size-symmetric (after accounting for the decline of RGR with size), suggesting that competition for nutrients limits the growth of moun tain beech. Release from competition was strongest on fertile sites (low C to-N ratio), and at low altitudes, but in contrast to current theories, release from competition following disturbance was least pronounced in stands of high basal area. Assuming that disturbance history is reflected in changing basal area, our results imply that the severity of disturbance is important in determining the degree of release from competition afterwards. We argue that nutrient sequestration in living biomass, in combination with the slow decomposition of dead wood, result in a paucity of contestable nutrients in stands of high basal area, even after low-severity disturbance. Our results support a view that biotic factors can be important drivers of competitive interactions in forests. We also observed weak facilitation in a few loca tions, supporting the hypothesis that facilitation becomes increasingly im portant under conditions of abiotic "stress". CORBIN, J. D. and C. M.

The maintenance of native grass biodiversity in California grasslands in the face of invasion by Eurasian annual and perennial grasses has proven to be a formidable challenge. Whereas perennial grasses such as Nassella pulchra, Festuca rubra, and Agrostis oregonensis were thought to dominate north coast grasslands prior to European settlement, introduced annual and perennial grasses are dominant even in stands where native bunchgrasses have persisted. Evidence that the exotics are capable of higher rates of growth than natives suggests that the exotics may rely on relatively high nitrogen availability to fuel growth. We tested whether experimental ad dition of sawdust reduces plant-available nitrogen in the soil, and whether native grasses fare better in competition with exotic grasses under these conditions. In 1998 we established a series of plots in which three native perennial bunchgrass species were grown alone, in combination with three exotic annual grass species, and in combination with three exotic perennial grass species. During the first growing season, NH4-N pools in the soil in March were lower (p&lt;O.O75) in plots that received sawdust addition than 78 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="40">in plots that did not receive sawdust addition. There was no difference in NH4-N pools in May. Above-ground production of all native species was reduced by both sawdust addition and competition with each group of exotic species. However, the competition-caused reduction in growth of natives by exotics was less for two of the three native grass species when sawdust was added. Hence the success of native grasses may be increased by the reduction in soil nitrogen caused by sawdust addition. This technique may prove to be a cost-effective and efficient method of improving the competitiveness of some native grass species, particularly in nitrogen-en riched ecosystems. CORCKET, E.' R. M.

Abandonment of farms in the foothills of the western Alps has led to substantial changes in grassland community composition. Foothill mead ows once dominated by Bromus erectus are being rapidly invaded by the highly competitive but grazing-intolerant, Brachypodium pinnatum. This successional change corresponds with a substantial decrease in total plant species diversity. Because previous field experiments indicate that Brachy podium is also more susceptible to insect herbivory than Bromus, we con ducted a field experiment in which the growth rates of Bromus and Bra chypodium were compared with and without interspecific neighbors and in plots sprayed with insecticide versus control plots. We found that both Bromus and Brachypodium were grazed by grasshoppers, but the leaves of Brachypodium were more damaged than those of Bromus in the control (no insecticide) plots. Furthermore, without neighbors, sprayed Brachypo dium produced more leaves than Bromus. These results demonstrate that grazing by insects, like that of livestock, disproportionally reduces the com petitive ability of the dominant competitor, Brachypodium, and that such indirect interactions may play a crucial role in maintaining species diversity in historical grasslands in the French Alps.

Comparative physi ological ecology of native and alien dry forest seedlings: The effects of light, water and weeding. Hawaii's dry forests are among the most endangered of all ecosystems in the archipelago. These severely fragmented forests harbor a rich flora with unique species assemblages and high diversity. Invasion of alien plant spe cies into these ecosystems is one of the most significant threats to on-going efforts to preserve and restore Hawaii's remaining dry forests. Comparing factors between alien and native plants such as determinants of growth and water-use efficiency can help predict the growth potential and evaluate the threat of invasive plant species in the remaining forest stands. In May 1998 seeds of 6 native woody species were sowed into 64, 1 m-2 plots under factorial combinations of supplemental water/ambient water, canopy shade/ full sun, and weeding of emerging alien species/no weeding. A severe drought led to virtually 100% mortality of all seedlings in the ambient water plots. In the supplemental water plots alien and native plants had higher maximum CO2 assimilation rates in sun plots (8.31 .mol -2 S-' in the sun and 6.04 ,umol m-2 s-lin the shade). Alien plants had higher light saturation points than native plants whereas native plants exhibited lower stomatal conductance and higher instantaneous water-use efficiency than alien plants. Although the presence of weeds had no significant effect on any measured foliar variable such as leaf nitrogen and leaf mass per unit area or instantaneous measurements of growth, net primary productivity of alien plants (in the non-weeded plots) was significantly higher than native plants, suggesting that given adequate water alien species compete with native species for the resources necessary to maintain and recover these endangered forest communities.

The Diamond Y Spring Preserve, an inland salt marsh located 15 km north of Ft. Stockton, Texas, is one of several locations where Helianthus par adoxus is found. Helianthus paradoxus is a locally abundant annual species but is geographically rare, occurring in several locations in New Mexico and in three locations in Texas. Little is known of the soil seed bank of this inland salt marsh. Seed banks are important to the re-establishment of flora after periods of unfavorable environmental conditions such as drought or fire, as well as from one growing season to the next. The Diamond Y Spring Preserve is dominated mainly by Distichlis spicata, Sporobulus ai roides, Scirpus americanus and Helianthus paradoxus. Investigations de termined the number and size of soil core samples that were needed to adequately sample the dominant communities of this inland salt marsh. The results showed that a sample size with an area of 0.1 m2 and six cm in depth is sufficient to sample the soil seed bank in this salt marsh. The total estimated seed density is 928/M2 for the Helianthus paradoxus community, 2.048/M2 for the Distichlis spicata community and 1,152/M2 for the Spo robulus airoides community. CRAINE, J.

Be yond Weaver: The relationship between the structure of root systems and resource utilization Understanding the consequences of changing resource availability on eco systems and species composition requires understanding the relationship between root system structure and ecosystem processes and how species differ in root system structure. Despite the extensive work on root systems by John Weaver and his contemporaries and over four decades of subse quent research, our understanding of the belowground systems of grass lands remains rudimentary. We measured a series of traits associated with root system structure and resource utilization on eleven species of grassland species of Cedar Creek Natural History Area, MN. Species were grown in monoculture in mesocosms in the field and harvested in their third growing season. Among the species we measured, it was clear that there were dif ferences the patterns of root system structure and resource utilization among 1) warm-season legumes, 2) rhizomatous C3 grasses and a C3 forb, and 3) a separate gradient of differentiation from tallgrass (C4 grass and C3 forb) to mixed grass (C4 grass) to shortgrass species (C4 grass and C3 grass). It is clear that a commonly used functional classifications (C3 grass es, C4 grasses, forbs, legumes) may not be the most robust classification with regard to productivity and resource utilization. The grassland species differed in their construction, production, and placement of fine and coarse biomass in the soil profile. This led to consistent patterns in aboveground production, nitrogen and water utilization, and ecosystem nitrogen reten tion. Across all species and depths examined, there were strong relation ships between the amount of fine root biomass present in a unit of volume of soil and the amount of water or nitrogen available, but no relationship for coarse root biomass. As such, separation of coarse and fine root biomass is as important as separating stems and leaves. In general there were few differences among these species in the total biomass N and differences in biomass were due to dilution of N, not to higher acquisition. CRAUSBAY, S.

Monsoon systems passing over Indonesia vary on an interannual scale in part due to the El Nifno/Southern Oscillation system. This scale of climate variability is known from modern records to impact the biosphere through changes in forest structure, species composition, and fire regime. However, interannual variability of climate is a short-term event rarely registered in the geological record thus long-term variability of the system is seldom quantified. Furthermore, the long-term effect of interannual variability on the biota is poorly understood. To quantify biotic response to periods of anomalous climatic parameters, e.g. changes in forest community compo sition after a series of more frequent and intense dry seasons, independent estimates of interannual climate and biotic history from a sensitive region are necessary.

Climate change and its effect on the range shift of Atalopedes campes tris, the sachem skipper butterfly: Experimental evidence for a climatic range limiting factor. One of the predicted consequences of global warming is that many species will shift their ranges to higher latitudes and elevations. Over the past 50 years, the temperature in the Pacific Northwest has risen 1.5-3 degrees C. Atalopedes campestris is a generalist, southern skipper butterfly that has moved northward -500km over this time period. I explored the factors that limit the range of this species. I will present field-measured microcli mate and caterpillar transplant data along a thermal cline that crosses the range boundary. I also measured three ecologically relevant indices of cold tolerance to assess the mechanism by which winter minimum temperature may constrain this species. Laboratory measures included the supercooling point, survival after exposure to extreme cold, and survival after exposure to typical, diurnally fluctuating, simulated January conditions near the range edge. These data show that this species has limited cold tolerance and experiences significantly higher mortality outside the range than within the range. This research contributes to a better understanding of mecha nisms of range limits and range change within the context of rapid envi ronmental change. CRUMRINE, P. University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA. Be havioral interactions between intraguild predators: Implications for risk reduction and risk enhancement. Intraguild predation (IGP) and IGP risk/opportunity add important but un derstudied complexities to predator-prey interactions. Behavioral assays in addition to traditional short term predator-prey experiments that monitor prey mortality were used to evaluate several possible ways two predators, larvae of the dragonflies Anax junius and Plathemis lydia interact when sharing a common prey species, fathead minnow hatchlings (Pimephales promelas). In this system, A. junius was the top predator and P. lydia the intermediate predator and fathead minnow hatchlings were the shared prey. To quantify minnow mortality, P. promelas were exposed to A. junius only, P. lydia only, A. junius and P. lydia or neither in a 2 x 2 factorial design. An additional set of treatments in which one or both predators were unable to feed, were used to isolate behavioral changes in dragonfly larvae. Results indicate, that when these two predators preyed in combination on P. pro melas, their effect was less than that predicted by the independent effects of each predator, a phenomenon known as risk reduction. The behavioral interaction between A. junius and P. lydia was asymmetric. Specifically, the presence of A. junius caused P. lydia to decrease its activity level. The presence of P. lydia elicited a diet shift in A. junius. A. junius consumed a significant number of P. lydia when they were present, but this IGP effect alone did not account for the observed level of risk reduction. This study provided insights into the conditions that result in risk reduction when prey face multiple predators. CUDDINGTON, K.,' D. VASSEUR,2 W. CURRLE2 and P.

Allometric relationships are claimed to be general laws for biology, in some sense comparable to laws in physics and chemistry. Many characteristics of animals such as metabolic rate, reproductive rate and movement rate scale with body size according to the allometric relationship, Y=CMb, where the constant, C, is determined by the ecological type of the organism (e.g. homeotherm vs. poikilotherm) and b is the scaling exponent. Empir ical data, calculated for a variety of physiological rates across a range of body sizes, supports the claim that this scaling factor ranges from 0.5 to 0.75. Recently, a theoretical argument has been used to predict a scaling exponent of 0.75. We address two points: The dearth of data focusing on scaling relationships for small-bodied invertebrates, and the appropriate scaling exponent to describe these relationships. Quite often scaling ex ponents are estimated from datasets which lump many species, and which normally have a preponderance of homeotherm vertebrates (e.g. mammals and birds). Where ecological types are separated to generate scaling rela tionships, large-bodied invertebrates make up the majority of data points for poikilotherms. While such lumping of data and generalization across ecological types may be appropriate for some uses of allometric relation ships, for other applications this degree of generalization could lead to grossly erroneous predictions. We collected data from a wide range of sources and generated allometric relationships for metabolic, reproductive and feeding rates of invertebrates from terrestrial and aquatic environments. We tested the claim that the scaling exponent of 0.75 is a general relation ship for physiological rates. Our data suggest a 0.75 scaling exponent is the best description of allometric relationships for small-bodied inverte brates. CUMMING, J. R., S. P. MILLER, N. L. SHEETS and D. G. PANAC CIONE.

Local scale population variation in Cenococcum geophilum on serpentine and non-serpentine soils Elevated Mg/Ca ratios and Ni concentrations characterize soils developed on ultramafic ("serpentine") parent material. These soil characteristics often favor adapted serpentine flora. We hypothesized that serpentine soils should also select mycorrhizal fungi ecotypes adapted to these unique edaphic conditions. To test this hypothesis, we trapped isolates of Cenococcum geophilum from serpentine and non-serpentine soils from the Soldiers De light Natural Environmental Area in Maryland. We used restriction frag ment length polymorphism studies of beta-tubulin genes and the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA, as well as amplified frag ment length polymorphism studies to assess variation among populations. UPGMA analysis and distance matrices based on these data indicated that isolates from serpentine soils clustered distinctly from non-serpentine iso lates from nearby (approximately 500 m), more distant (10 km), and distant (3800 km) sites. These results indicate that serpentine soil factors present a significant selective pressure on populations of Cenococcum geophilum, leading to populations dominated by serpentine ecotypes.

The application of methods developed in terrestrial ecology to habitat mod els for stream-dwelling organisms is complicated by difficulties in quan tifying some of the important properties of streams, including their con nectivity, complexity, and temporal variability. Conversely, the linearity of streams lends itself to a more explicit recognition of spatial patterns, in cluding autocorrelation and the existence of environmental gradients; stream habitat models must directly confront issues that are often ignored in terrestrial systems. Two distinct modelling approaches demonstrate the importance of stream topology for predictive models of fish distributions. Firstly, environmental data and a statewide database of fish collection re cords (assembled by the DNR) for Wisconsin are used to show how logistic regression methods can be adapted to make useful, probabilistic predictions in aquatic systems. Models for several fish species are developed from a set of readily-mapped environmental variables including elevation, hydrol ogy, surficial geomorphology, soil type, stream order and explicit measures of distance. Measures of stream topology and the distances of collection records from the mainstem of the nearest large river emerge as useful predictor variables from this exercise. Secondly, I consider the importance of stream topology using a non-linear, stochastic cellular automaton model that assumes a homogeneous habitat. The model predicts that streams with 80 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="42">proportionally more branches are likely to be invaded (or recolonised) at faster rates than more linear streams, and should support a higher abun dance of aquatic species. Concepts arising from the study of streams offer a potentially useful paradigm from which issues of connectivity, habitat fragmentation and other explicitly spatial problems in terrestrial ecology and conservation can be approached.

Cuscuta salina is a parasitic plant found in the salt marshes of the north eastern Pacific. This species has been observed to parasitize most of the species found in our three San Diego County study sites. These hosts form large high density stands, although C. salina is not common these stands. We investigated factors controlling the abundance of C. salina. Quadrat and transect sampling was carried out to identify host and parasite patterns in relation to each other and to elevation. Although C. salina was found on all perennial salt marsh species, its abundance and frequency was high est within a 50cm middle elevation band. Beyond that band, presence was infrequent and absent at extremes. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine if inundation and salt stress could account for the distribution of C. salina. Inundation was found to significantly increase mortality in C. salina whereas increased salt stress did not illicit a significant change in mortality. We speculate that all individuals in the host population are suit able for parasite establishment and growth except at low elevations. Low densities of the parasite in higher elevations may be explained by dispersal limitation. Spatial distributions of C. salina and their hosts were mapped at multiple scales for up to three years. Cuscuta salina was significantly clustered in space and time. With field experiments we are currently testing the assumption that all individuals in high elevations are suitable hosts. CUNDIFF, A. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94704. The effect of groundwater contamination by domestic sewage on dissolved inor ganic nitrogen fluxes in a Bermudian mangrove bay. Cesspit seepage has been shown to contaminate Bermudian groundwater. However, the ecological significance of this pollution on the mangrove forest and the ocean has not been determined. Water samples from the mangrove forest at Hungry Bay, Bermuda and nearby groundwater were analyzed to test whether outwelling groundwater is a significant source of inorganic nitrogen to the bay and inshore waters. Sea and freshwater mix ing were tracked along the tidal inundation gradient to calculate the flux of incoming groundwater in October and November 1999. To construct an inorganic nitrogen budget for the forest, samples were taken over four weeks from house wells in the drainage area, the standing water and creek system in the forest at high and low tide, interstitial forest water, and the bay. Approximately 79.6m3 groundwater enters the forest per hour, car rying between 202 and 238g inorganic nitrogen, virtually all in the form of nitrate. The mean concentration of inorganic nitrogen in ebbing water is 12.33mM. Thus, the flux of inorganic nitrogen from the forest to the bay is 1468g per tidal cycle. In addition to the nitrogen that leaves the forest on the ebb tide, between 2114 and 3014g inorganic nitrogen from groundwater are absorbed by the forest per day. The additional inorganic nitrogen deposited in the bay due to human sources may have adverse eutrophication effects on nearby coastal reef ecosystems. These data sug gest that the mangrove forest may sequester excess nitrogen, thereby buff ering inshore waters from excess nitrogen loading. CUNNINGHAM, S.

There is growing concern that fragmentation of natural habitats will disrupt the relationships between plants and their pollinators, potentially causing declining reproductive success in plant populations. Few studies to date, however, have been able to link depressed fruit production by wild plants with depressed pollen delivery in habitat fragments. In central New South Wales, Australia, fragments of "mallee" woodland vegetation are found scattered throughout an otherwise agricultural landscape. Small vegetation fragments most commonly occur as linear strips along roads, railways and fences. In 1997 and 1998 I examined fruit set efficiency (fruit/flower or fruit/inflorescence) of two understorey shrub species, Acacia brachybotrya and Eremophila glabra, comparing plants growing in linear strips to con specifics growing in bigger fragments. For both species in both years, plants growing in linear strips generally had lower fruit set efficiency. To test the hypothesis that depressed pollination was the cause of low fruit set I ex amined pollen loads of flowers, and found that plants growing in linear vegetation remnants received less pollen than conspecifics in nearby re serves. Pollen supplementation significantly increased fruit production by both species, indicating pollen limitation of fruit set. Together these obser vations explain why fruit production by these species was depressed in linear strip populations relative to nearby reserves. Disrupted pollination interactions of the kind documented in this study offer substantial chal lenges to the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes. CURRIE, W. S. University of Maryland, College Park, MD 21532. Fluxes of bioavailable energy released during decomposition in the temperate forest floor. When the energy content of ecological material is determined through bomb calorimetry, this question arises: What fraction of that energy is bioavailable in a given heterotrophic community under the prevailing en vironmental conditions? For detrital decomposition, that question can be answered through measurement of stored energy at stages in the decay sequence, combined with a budgeting technique. The release of energy between decay stages is the bioavailable energy for the particular hetero trophic community acting on the particular detritus under the prevailing conditions. My objective was to develop and apply this technique in the temperate forest floor, a location of rapid C and N cycling. I collected fresh litter, partially decayed litter, and commingled, later-stage detritus in pine and oak forests at the Harvard Forest, MA. I measured the caloric energy content of this material. I then augmented an existing biogeochemical pro cess model of C and N cycling, containing detrital material in stages of decay, to include pools and fluxes of energy. In the pine forest, fresh foliar litter contained ca. 5300 cal/g, whereas commingled later-stage detritus contained ca. 4400 caVg. Preliminary model calculations indicate the cu mulative dissipation of energy in Oi and Oe layers from non-woody litter decay is ca. 2600 kcal m-2 yr-l in this forest. This is a measure of energy available to drive biotic processes in the heterotrophic community, includ ing biotic nutrient turnover. These studies should ultimately contribute to a better thermodynamic foundation for the biogeochemistry of nutrient and C cycling in forest soils. CUSHING, E. J.' and A.

A Hindu-Javanese religious center flourished in the Dieng highlands of Central Java from about 700 to 1250 CE, but little is known of the kinds and intensity of human activity there. The pollen stratigraphy of a small lake next to the center indicates substantial and nearly continuous clearance of the montane forest since about 600 CE. Forest trees of Lithocarpus, Quercus, and Engelhardia were evidently replaced by the secondary trees Trema and Macaranga; abundant shrubs of Urticaceae, Acalypha, and Myr ica; the tree fern Cyathea; several ferns of open ground; and grasses. A zone of abundant pollen of the weedy herb Plantago major corresponds well in time with the occupation of the religious center, which at its max imum covered more than 20 ha. The religious center occupied part of the floor of a partly filled basin, and the lake was larger when the center was established. Through paludification, fen peat encroached on the lake and swamped the stone temples, despite the construction of drainage ditches and a tunnel beneath a low divide to an adjacent valley. The rising water table probably contributed to the abandonment of the center. After 1250 CE and a brief interval of tree expansion, the pollen of open-ground species again increased, suggesting continued human use of the uplands. In the mid- 19th century, European observers reported that the forest on the moun tains at Dieng was closed and mature, but evidence is lacking in the pollen stratigraphy. By the 1920s the expanding human population had stripped the landscape of trees, and the first pollen of cultivated plants appears in the stratigraphy. As a result of government protection and forest replanting, Oral Presentation Abstracts 81</page><page sequence="43">trees have again increased on the steepest slopes, but lower slopes are occupied by fields of potatoes, which disperse little pollen. The pollen assemblage today thus lacks the large percentages of shrubs that charac terized previous zones. Radiocarbon dates of the sediment are erratic, pos sibly because of volcanic CO2, but the best age model has a mean depo sition time of nearly 1 cm yr1 over the past 1300 years. Unusually large fluctuations in pollen percentages from sample to sample may result from annual or even seasonal variation in pollen production and dispersal. D'AVANZO, C.,' B. GRANT2 and S.

ESA sponsors a web site and CD-ROM that integrates student-active teaching with topical issues for big and small ecology courses. Even though increasing numbers of college science faculty say that they are including more student-active teaching in their courses, these reforms are often limited to labs. ESA's Education Section recent survey of about 130 introductory biology courses showed that 90% still rely on traditional lectures as their primary teaching approach. We are addressing this problem with new NSF support and creating a CD-ROM and an ESA-linked website that will help ecology faculty incorporate methods such as cooperative groupwork and discussion of open-ended questions in their lectures and into labs. I will describe one aspect of this project called "Issues to Teach Ecology" that is especially targeted at professors who want to actively involve their students, but who teach large classes. "Issues" have been identified by ESA as especially topical. They concern basic ecological con cepts, are based on good data accessible to undergraduates, and are open ended and likely controversial (e.g. coral loss off Florida, introduced spe cies). "Issues" will include 1) issue overview and links to rich information sources , 2) data for students to describe, interpret, and manipulate, 3) examples of various student-active approaches using the issue , 4) peda gogical information and links , 5) ways for faculty to interact with other ecology faculty using "Issues". We are seeking faculty to field test "Issues" and its companion "Experiment in Ecology". "Issues "or "Experiments" submitted by faculty may be used in promotion files because we have established a structure for their peer review. DAIL, D. B.,' E. A. DAVIDSON2 and J. CHOROVER.'

Immobilization of nitrate and nitrite in temperate forest soils: Microbial and abiotic processes and potential interaction. Biotic and abiotic mechanisms by which inputs of inorganic-N are con verted to organic-N and retained in soil were investigated using '5N in sterilized and live soils. Samples of the organic and mineral soil horizons were analyzed immediately after '5N addition and 24 hours later to deter mine '5N enrichment of nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, and organic-N pools. Efficacy of sterilization was confirmed by monitoring soil respiration dur ing the incubation period and serial plating of soil extracts of sterilized and non-sterilized soil on various solid media. Up to 20% of '5Nitrate was not recoverable as nitrate immediately after addition to organic soils, while all nitrate was recovered as such in mineral soils. About 30% of the nitrate added to organic soils moved into an organic fraction during the 24 hour incubation in sterilized soils, indicating that an abiotic process may be responsible for this immobilization. Although sterilization by autoclaving or GAMMA irradiation did not significantly affect the percentages of label recovered in inorganic and organic pools, autoclaving reduced overall re covery of '5N by as much as 50% and did so immediately upon addition. Autoclaving, and to a lesser degree, GAMMA irradiation of soils drastically reduced the total recovery of labeled nitrite; 20% and 44% respectively. Sterilization of soils may lead to changes in soil properties that enhance the conversion of nitrite (and nitrate) to nitrogen gasses. Hence, artifacts of sterilization are a concern, but nevertheless, these results show that an unidentified process of abiotic immobilization of nitrate to form organically bound N may be important in organic layers of temperate forest soils.

Ecologists are actively investigating variation in species interactions and the processes that underlie this variation across different environmental conditions. We examined species interactions across riffles and pools in an Andean piedmont stream in Venezuela. An enclosure/exclosure experiment was conducted to examine the effects of macroconsumers (fish) and a mi crograzer, Petrophila sp.: Pyralidae, on total benthic invertebrate density and algal biomass. Treatments included: 1) Open plot (accessible to the entire fish assemblage); 2) grazing fish enclosure; 3) micrograzer enclosure; and 4) a grazing fish/micrograzer exclosure. Total benthic invertebrate den sity decreased in open pool plots after 24 h due to heavy fish predation, and remained low throughout the 14 d experiment. In contrast, total benthic invertebrate densities did not differ among other treatments. Algal biomass differed by both treatment and habitat such that micrograzer mortality in open pool plots resulted in an indirect increase in algal biomass. A sub sequent cage experiment was conducted to determine if higher mortality of micrograzers in pools compared to riffles was due to differences in predation rates or micrograzer settlement rates. The relative importance of these processes differed according to habitat. Predation rates were higher in pools, but micrograzer settlement rates were higher in riffles. Results suggest species interactions in a diverse stream system vary between hab itats, but multiple processes are important in explaining the effects of this variation. DAMGAARD, C.1 and B. D.

Disease resistance in Arabidopsis increases the probability of long-term ecolog ical success. Quantitative predictions of the long-term effect of plant disease in natural plant communities are of general ecological interest, and may also aid in assessing the ecological risks of employing genetically modified disease resistant plants. Resistance is believed to play a role in the dynamics of plant communities, but quantitative predictions of the long-term behaviour of plant communities possessing resistance have not been made. One of the pathogens known to attack natural Arabidopsis thaliana populations is the biotrophic oomycete Peronospora parasitica. The pathogen causes downy mildew, but possible effects of the disease on the plant community structure are unknown. Here we show that the competitive ability of a disease resistant Arabidopsis ecotype increases significantly in the presence of the disease when competing with a susceptible Arabidopsis ecotype, and that the long-term ecological scenario is influenced by the presence of the disease. Without the disease the two Arabidopsis ecotypes are most likely to coexist, whereas in the presence of the disease, out-competition of the susceptible ecotype is the most likely long-term ecological scenario. DAMIANI, C. Duke University, Durham, NC 27708. The use of a matrix model to study indirect effects in a hermit crab-hydroid symbiosis. Indirect effects may play an important role in determining how changes in the biotic environment influence the nature of host-symbiont interactions. However, since direct and indirect effects often act on different demograph ic rates, it can be challenging to compare the relative importance of these two types of interactions. For example, the hydroid Hydractinia symbi olongicarpus has been shown to have negative direct effects on the fecun dity of its host hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus, and positive indirect ef fects on survival. In this study, I combined field experiments with a matrix model to integrate the hydroid's effects on different demographic rates into a common measure (population growth rate), which I used to quantify the relative contributions of direct and indirect effects to the net interaction. I found that indirect effects contributed strongly to the net interaction in the presence of fish predators, but weakly in the presence of crab predators, resulting in a symbiosis that shifts between parasitism and mutualism.

This research examines the impacts of climate variation on altitudinal tree lines in the southern Andes. We have analyzed forest structure and recent tree establishment at 26 treeline sites within three study areas in Chile and Argentina at ca. 40?S. Within areas, study sites were evenly distributed on north- and south-aspect slopes. Trees were measured in Sm-wide transects 82 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="44">extending from the erect forest, 10m below timberline, to treeline. Notho fiagus pumilio, N. antarctica formed treeline in Argentina; Chilean treelines also included N. betuloides. Maximum treeline elevations were 1295 miles above sea level in Chile and 1525 miles above sea level in Argentina. Treeline ecotones varied in length from five to 140 m. The majority of Nothofagus pumilio seedlings (height &lt;130cm) were growing in the forest or within 10m of timberline. Seedlings were most abundant on sites with north aspects in Chile, and were virtually absent from north-aspects at the eastern study area in Argentina. A sample of 1200 seedlings (height &lt;1 30cm) revealed ages from one to &gt;70 years. Frequency distributions of age were multi-modal with single years accounting for up to 30% of ob servations for each study area. Superposed epoch analyses showed statis tically significant relationships between seedling abundance and moisture availability and precipitation during the growing season. These results in dicate the importance of moisture availability, rather than temperature, for tree seedling establishment at altitudinal treeline in Chile, where precipi tation is high, and in the drier climate of Argentina.

Worldwide, many grassland ecosystems have been invaded by woody veg etation with a variety of causal factors implicated (e.g., fire suppression, grazing management). Tallgrass prairie is no exception, where gallery for ests dominated by Quercus macrocarpa Michx. and Q. muhlenbergii En gelm. have expanded into adjacent grasslands. To assess the degree of competitive interactions between trees and dominant grasses in prairie sites and along the prairie-forest ecotone, we conducted a field experiment in which prairie grasses were removed adjacent to oak juveniles. We predicted that the ecotone environment would facilitate oak success relative to the prairie. Both oak species reponded positively to aboveground removal of grasses in prairie with a 20% increase in photosynthesis. This response was not found along the ecotone. Photosynthesis in ecotone oaks was 33% lower compared to prairie juveniles. Stomatal conductance did not respond to removal of grasses for either species in prairie and ecotone. Greenhouse experiments indicated that seedlings of both species can extend their roots to soil depths greater than 80 cm in 10 weeks. This deep root system may explain the higher predawn water potentials in the oaks compared to the dominant C4 grasses. Overall, grass removal did not affect oak water re lations. We concluded that the grasses negatively impacted carbon gain in oak juveniles in the prairie, and that overstory trees along the ecotone did not facilitate carbon gain or water relations in oak juveniles.

Controls on macrophyte production and abundance in estuaries: Interaction between physical stress and resource competition. Contemporary ecological theories often present physical stress and resource competition as opposing, disparate mechanisms for controlling macrophyte primary production in ecosystems. In most cases these theories have been tested in ecosystems in which one factor is clearly of greater import than the other. Estuaries, in contrast, represent inherently dynamic and complex systems in which both physical stress and resource competition vary in accordance with changing salinity, and relative phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) availability. Research has shown that correlations between leaf tissue N:P ratios and aboveground abundance/productivity can be used to assess the role of nutrient availability in controlling macrophyte community struc ture. We used this approach to investigate the importance of nutrient avail ability in the Edisto River, SC estuary. Our 7 sites spanned the estuarine salinity gradient (average salinities ranged from 0 to 20 ppt). In addition, we quantified porewater sulfide (S-2) and chloride concentrations (Cl-) as a measure of physical stress. Peak biomass occurred in October at all sites. Among sites, the oligohaline site (salinity =~ 7 ppt) had the greatest biomass and highest productivity rates (1989 g DW m-2 and 11.06 g DW m-2 day-). Significant relationships between N:P ratios and abundance were found for most saltwater sites and at the freshwater site. At the oligohaline sites, however, N:P ratios were uncorrelated with both productivity and abundance. This was also true for saltwater sites where S-2 concentrations were high (&gt;300 uM). These data suggest that saltwater sites are N-limited and that N-availability is important in determining production patterns at this end of estuaries. In addition, freshwater sites appear to P-limited and, consequently, P-availability plays a major role in controlling plant com munity structure there. In contrast, however, nutrient availability seems to be unimportant in the oligohaline zone. This is also true when physical factors such as S-2 stress becomes overwhelming. Our results, therefore, illustrate that both physical stress and resource competition play important roles in determining patterns of macrophyte production in estuaries. DAVIDSON, E. A. and K. SAVAGE. The Woods Hole Research Center, Woods Hole, MA 02543. Comparing estimates of soil respiration using chamber-based and tower-based methods. Soil respiration can be measured directly using chamber techniques, and it can be inferred from tower-based eddy covariance estimates of total eco system respiration. Unfortunately, chamber-based estimates of soil respi ration are often 50% higher than total ecosystem respiration estimated by eddy covariance. The causes of this discrepancy are not known. Chamber techniques underestimate gas fluxes when the natural concentration gradi ent is altered by the presence of the chamber, and this error can be mini mized by using short measurement intervals. Variation of pressure within the chamber can also cause either over- or underestimation of fluxes. Pres sure differentials should vary with the flow rates of gas circulated between the chamber and the CO2 analyzer, but we have found no effect of flow rate on estimated CO2flux, indicating that this source of error is probably insignificant. Stable conditions at nighttime complicate eddy covariance estimates, possibly causing underestimation of respiration. In addition to possible systematic methodological errors of both methods, differences ex ist regarding the spatial and temporal variation over which fluxes are es timated. Chamber measurements are often made in the area around a tower, but the tower may be affected by soil emissions several hundred meters away from the tower. At the Howland Forest of central Maine, we estimated mean soil CO2 flux from chamber measurements for each soil drainage class within the landscape and applied these to a fine resolution soil map covering 12 km2 of the tower area. We then overlayed onto this map some plausible tower footprint areas that estimate the area sampled by the eddy covariance method. Depending on the wind direction and the assumed size of the tower footprint, the estimated soil source of CO2 that would be detected by tower-based eddy covariance measurements varied by about 20%. Hence, spatial variation of soil drainage classes is an important factor for estimating soil respiration at the scale relevant to tower measurements, but spatial variation alone does not account for large differences often observed between tower-based eddy covariance estimates of respiration and soil chamber measurements commonly made near the tower base.

Comparative effects of Gunnison's prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats on plants and grasshoppers in a semi-arid grassland. Prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats are keystone species in semi arid grasslands. Their burrowing and foraging activities are known to change the species composition and structure of grassland communities. In the American Southwest where the geographic distributions of prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats overlap, the relative effects of their activ ities on grassland ecosystems are unknown. Previous research has exam ined the impacts of black-tailed prairie dogs on vegetation and soils, yet little is known of the effects of Gunnison's prairie dogs on soils, vegetation, or other animals. Some research has examined the influences of banner tailed kangaroo rats on soils and vegetation, but not of their interactive effects with prairie dogs on soils, plants, and other animals. As the impor tance of prairie dogs to semi-arid grassland ecosystems is becoming rec ognized, and efforts are being made to restore prairie dog populations, information on their ecological roles is needed. The goals of this study are to determine the influences of Gunnison's prairie dogs and banner-tailed kangaroo rats on soil disturbance, and plant and grasshopper communities in a semi-arid grassland. Our research is being conducted at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico where banner-tailed kangaroo rats and a recently expanding colony of Gunnison's prairie dogs coexist. Our initial results demonstrate that Gunnison's prairie dogs and banner tailed kangaroo rats create different patterns of soil disturbance patches Oral Presentation Abstracts 83</page><page sequence="45">associated with their mounds, and have different effects on plant and grass hopper species compositions, abundance, and distributions. Prairie dogs construct many small burrow mounds (-0.5 m diameter). As a result, they create more diffuse, less intense local disturbance patches on the landscape, and their impacts tend to be more widespread. Banner-tailed kangaroo rats create large (-1-2 m diameter) burrow mounds, causing larger, more in tense localized disturbance patches. As the colony expands, we will con tinue to monitor the influences of these animals on the grassland commu nity. DAVIDSON, J. M. University of California, Davis, CA 95616 USA. Ad vantage to long-distance pollination in Leuhea seemannii, a tropical pioneer tree. Paternity analyses for tropical trees show evidence of significant long dis tance gene flow (- 500 m), yet studies on pollinator movement indicate pollinators move most commonly between flowers on a given tree and then to nearest neighbor trees. What accounts for the difference in observed pollen movement over short distances versus fertilization success over long distances in tropical trees? I performed artificial crosses with pollen from near (&lt; 100m) and far donors (&gt; 2km) on seven Luehea seemannii trees within the Barro Colorado Nature Monument in Panama, to test for fitness differences in these two pollen sources in terms of seed capsule maturation, seed number/capsule, seed weight/capsule, seed resistance to soil pathogens during dormancy, and seedling growth. Pollen from far donors resulted in a significantly higher proportion of capsule maturation than pollen from near donors, translating into approximately 20% more seeds produced by far crosses than near crosses. Other measures of fitness did not differ sig nificantly between the two pollen sources. Luehea is self-incompatible and has wind-dispersed seeds that form seed banks around parent trees and then germinate in light gaps. This dispersal syndrome may lead to higher levels of genetic relatedness among near-neighbors as opposed to distant adults, resulting in greater incompatibility or early-acting inbreeding due to near crosses, and an advantage to long-distance pollination for the onset of seed development.

The effects of spatial pattern on diversity-productivity rela tionships in a northern mixed grass prairie. We present an operationally feasible measurement scheme relying on the spatial organization of vegetation for the investigation of grassland diver sity-productivity relationships. We hypothesized that stronger fine-scale or ganization of species within a moderately varying community is associated with (a) higher production, and (b) lower patchiness of production. The assessment of species composition and ecosystem functioning requires find ing the appropriate scale for comparison under natural field conditions. Using a geographical information system, we identified three Iha sites along a resource gradient in the strongly moisture-limited northern mixed grass prairie (Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada). These sites were located in representative undisturbed Stipa-Bouteloua-Agropyron upland communities (primarily above 900m a.s.l. and 50-lOOm above the floodplain of the Frenchman River). Two sampling transects were posi tioned within each site. Productivity was characterized by spectral radi ometer observations (0.5m resolution) of the normalized difference vege tation index (NDVI) and estimates of leaf-area index (LAI) arranged in a scalable sampling scheme between 0.4m and 50m. Species occurrences were recorded along semi-circular transects allowing scaling between 0.05m and 25m. A wide range of correlations were found between diversity and productivity measures as a function of spatial resolution (e.g. LAI vs. species richness; R2=0 (0.05m) to R2=0.5 (2m)). We demonstrated pos sible inferences about spatial and temporal characteristics of production based on the number of local species combinations (NRSC). NRSC, as a function of sampling resolution, had a characteristic maximum predicted by patch-level productivity pattern with significantly better confidence than species richness. These observations suggest that single-scale measures are potentially insufficient for the long-term monitoring and prediction of eco system structure and functioning. To characterize diversity-productivity re lationships under natural conditions scalable observations should be applied with diagnostic statistical models. DAY, M. E., M. S. GREENWOOD and A. S. WHITE. University of Maine, Orono, Maine 04469 USA. Long-term maturational changes in foliar morphology and physiology in red spruce in relation to declining net primary productivity with tree age. The contribution of genetically-determined maturation to age-related de cline in forest productivity is poorly understood. While changes in mor phological and physiological attributes associated with transition from ju venile to reproductively-mature phases have been described for many woody species, few studies have examined maturational changes that occur after the onset of reproductive development. We studied needle morphology and gas exchange in a population of red spruce (Picea rubens (Sarg.)) growing in a multicohort stand where ages ranged from germinants to over 150 years. Both sun- and shade-adapted foliage were collected from cohorts with mean ages of 2, 5, 10, 20, 45, and 120 years, and foliar morphology was evaluated by image analysis. Differences in gas exchange character istics were compared among 20, 45, and 120 year age-classes in a common rootstock experiment, where grafting upper crown scions onto 3-year-old rootstock removed the influence of tree size. Grafted trees were maintained for three growing seasons in a common environment before measurement. Both sun- and shade-adapted foliage sampled from in situ trees showed rapid increase in mean needle size between 2 and 20 years of age, followed by a more gradual increase. Grafted scions showed a similar trend in needle size with age. Similar trends were observed for both shade and sun foliage. Grafted scions showed decline with age-class in MNA and needle packing, but not SLM. Stomatal conductance in full sunlight declined from a mean of 158 mmol m-2 s-4 in 20-year-old scions to 119 and 45 mmol m-2 s-' in 45- and 120-year-old scions, respectively. Mean maximum photosynthetic rates decreased slightly (nonsignificant) between 20- and 45-year-old sci ons, but declined by about 50% between younger and 120-year-old scions. Apparent quantum efficiency and dark respiration were also significantly lower in the oldest age-class. These results suggest that morphological and physiological changes continue long after the onset of reproductive matu rity in red spruce. Additionally, the common-rootstock study implies that productivity in older red spruce may be limited, at least in part, by devel opmental changes that influence gas exchange and, therefore, may have a genetic basis.

Ontoge netic niche shifts, flexible behavior and size-structured population dy namics. Flexible behavior in animals has been suggested to have substantial effects on population dynamics. Characteristic for theoretical studies on the im plications of flexible behavior for population dynamics is that individual level processes such as foraging rate have been linked to population pro cesses using traditional non-structured predator-prey models. This situation contrasts to the fact that a vast number of experimental studies on flexible predator and prey behavior concern organisms of populations which are typically size/stage-structured. To study the consequences of flexible indi vidual behavior for the stability and persistence of size-structured consum er-resource systems, we analyzed a size-structured population model for a single consumer and two resource populations, each of which lives in its own habitat. Shifts by individual consumers between the habitats were based on a decision rule taking both growth and mortality risk into account. We considered two types of habitat shifts: (1) a single, instantaneous on togenetic niche shift during consumer life history and (2) a continuous shifting back and forth between habitats, representing a flexible response to current growth and mortality conditions. Flexible behavior was shown to increase persistence of the consumer population, but its influence on population dynamics was small, when population persistence did not crit ically depend on it. In case flexible behavior has a population dynamical effect, its influence was mainly to induce population cycles by intensifying the competition among cohorts of different sizes.

The problem of fitting population models to data is confounded by the combined effects of environmental variability and inaccurate observations. 84 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="46">We evaluate a method that incorporates both process noise and observation error to fit models to time series data in a likelihood framework. The meth od numerically calculates likelihoods in a state-space formulation for non linear, non-Gaussian models that are analagous to the linear, Guassian like lihoods of the Kalman filter. We compare the method to two common methods, least squares with process noise only or with observation error only, using Beverton-Holt and Ricker models. The numerical state-space method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable point parameters and one of the noise variances small, i.e. close to least squares assumptions, in which case one of the least squares methods was superior. We also evaluated each method for model selection using infor mation criteria. All methods were biased toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. Least squares with process error was least biased for model selection. Con vergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic distributions was good for stable-point Ricker parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least accurate for the Beverton-Holt mod el. The numerical state-space method offers a useful tool for connecting models and data and ecology. DEBERRY, J. W, R. T. BELCHER, D. T. LOOMIS and R. B. ATKINSON. Christopher Newport University, Newport News, Virginia. A comparison of aboveground structure and litter production of Atlantic white cedar swamps in northeastern North Carolina. Structural and functional attributes including aboveground biomass, basal area, species composition, stem density, litter production and hydrology were measured in naturally regenerated Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.)B.S.P stands in Great Dismal Swamp (GDSNWR) and Alligator River National Wildlife Refuges (ARNWR). Two stands were selected at each refuge rep resenting mature (60-70) and intermediate (15-35) age classes. Total aboveground biomass for mature stands was 234,447 - 225,392 kg/ha and among intermediate sites 131,989 - 113,252 kg/ha. Although total biomass was similar within each age class, other aspects of structure differed. Cha maecyparis thyoides was the dominant tree species contributing greater than 58% relative basal area in all stands; however, Acer rubrum dominated GDSNWR intermediate in terms of relative biomass (56%). Live tree den sity was greater (P&lt;0.01) for ARNWR sites, particularly in ARNWR in termediate (39,722 stems/ha) which was 14 times greater than GDSNWR intermediate. Annual litterfall productivity exhibited a similar trend: ARNWR mature (526 g/m2) and intermediate (379 g/m2) productivity was higher than GDSNWR mature (324 g/m2) and intermediate (251 g/m2) re spectively. Furthermore, both ARNWR sites were considerably wetter (P&lt;0.001) than GDSNWR sites, based upon eleven months of twice daily depth to water table readings. Hydrologic differences among GDSNWR and ARNWR may explain species composition and vegetation differences. However, productivity results suggest that other environmental variables may be influencing these stands. DECKER, E. H.,' B. T MILNE,' E A. SMITH' and S. M. ELLIOTT2 'University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131USA; 2Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM USA. Global distribution of ur ban ecosystems. Because humans appropriate an enormous proportion of global resources and energy, understanding patterns and mechanisms of human population distribution is essential for addressing both ecological and social problems. Central Place Theory has been the dominant paradigm in human geogra phy, but there has been very little ecological theory about processes that govern the distribution of urban areas. Here we analyze the distribution of cities globally using satellite and census data. We examine size-specific nearest neighbor distances, rank size distributions, and measures of spatial arrangement to quantify patterns of urban distribution. We then develop a theory for explaining these patterns in ecological and energetic terms that addresses the flow of material and energy through and among urban areas. We find that patterns of city distribution are general and global, and that energy considerations contribute greatly to explaining these patterns. Our results suggest that socioeconomic details are unnecessary for understand ing macroscopic patterns of human settlements. DECKER, K. and R. E. J. BOERNER. Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, U.S.A. Decomposition and nitrogen release from leaves of three Chilean Nothofagus species. As a portion of a larger study of nutrient cycling in a Chilean mixed deciduous Nothofagus forest, we tested the hypothesis that leaf litter from the mid elevation deciduous Nothofagus obliqua would decompose faster than leaf litter from the evergreen N. dombeyi and the high elevation de ciduous N. pumilio. During 1997, we collected litter in a mixed stand of the three Nothofagus species at approximately 1430m. in the south central Chilean Andes. Litter was placed in mesh bags and allowed to decompose for 1, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, and 12 months in a mixed hardwood forest in Ohio. For all three species, mass loss fit linear functions best. Instantaneous decay rates averaged -0.975 y-I (N. obliqua), -0.749 y-I (N. dombeyi), and -1.053 y-1 (N. pumilio). N. obliqua leaves decayed significantly faster than N. dombeyi leaves. Decay rates of N. pumilio leaves were more variable and did not differ from N obliqua or N. dombeyi. We will also discuss rates of N release from Nothofagus litters and the relevance of these results in relation to previous work in this Chilean forest that has shown that N. dombeyi and N. pumilio inhabit soil with lower N turnover rates than N. obliqua.

Survival and reproduction in the presence of UV radiation: A matter of repair? A reduction in stratospheric ozone and subsequent increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the earth has been documented over north and south temperate regions. Many laboratory studies have focused on the effects of UVR on organismal survival and reproduction. In order to extrapolate UV effects from the lab to nature, the assumption of reci procity must be met. Reciprocity is only satisfied when the effect of a total radiation exposure (dose) is independent of the time over which the ex posure occurred (dose rate). The ability of organisms to undergo repair in the presence of light is thought to be a confounding factor in studies where reciprocity fails. This laboratory study explicitly tests whether reciprocity holds in two freshwater invertebrates with differing proficiencies of repair: A Cladoceran (Daphnia) which has been shown to have high repair, and a rotifer (Asplanchna) which is thought to have little to no repair. We found significant repair and a failure of reciprocity when comparing survival at different dose rates for both species. However, in a higher dose experiment with Asplanchna, we found no significant repair, and reciprocity held. These experiments show that there is a link between repair and reciprocity when survival data are used. Conversely, the ability of both Daphnia and Asplanchna to produce offspring after being exposed to UVR did not vary with dose rate. Reciprocity held in all cases. The capability to directly extrapolate the effects of UVR in the lab to its effects in nature depends not only on an organism's repair processes, but also on whether data is gathered on the organism's survival or reproduction.

Plant-plant interactions in a Mojave Desert plant community exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 during a year with above-average precipitation. Desert ecosystems are expected to have large increases in plant productivity as atmospheric CO2 rises because greater plant water use efficiency should increase soil moisture. The growth responses of plants to elevated CO2 are complex, especially in natural plant communities where different growth forms interact to acquire limited soil moisture. We examined plant-plant interactions in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem using FACE (Free Air CO2 Enrichment) technology. We measured the absolute growth rate (AGR) and reproductive effort (number of flowers/maximum biomass) of target individuals of two C3 species: Eriogonum trichopes (annual forb) and Achn atherum hymenoides (perennial grass). We also quantified the change in plant cover surrounding targets for analysis in a multiple linear regression to determine whether these neighbors influenced target plant performance under elevated (550 Fimol mol'l) and ambient CO2 concentrations. Erio gonum AGR and reproductive effort were not significantly different be Oral Presentation Abstracts 85</page><page sequence="47">tween CO2 treatments because this annual species completed its life cycle during the spring when above-average precipitation maintained high soil moisture. While the four dominant annual species surrounding Eriogonum targets increased in canopy cover under elevated CO2, the total cover of all annual plant species was not significantly different between CO2 treat ments. Thus, species composition and growth response differed among neighbor annual species under elevated CO2. Achnatherum AGR was sig nificantly greater under elevated CO2, and this enhanced response occurred in summer when soil moisture became more limited. Although neighbor grasses and forbs did not have an effect on Achnatherum performance, the cover of neighbor perennial shrubs and grasses was associated with a re duction in AGR, and this effect was greater under elevated CO2. As CO2 continues to rise, differences in the responses of species in mixed com munities to available moisture will likely influence future plant commu nities of arid systems. DESIMONE, S. A.

Factors influencing invasion of south ern Californian grasslands by the herbaceous perennial mediterranean climate exotic, Cynara cardunculus. In southern California, the herbaceous perennial, Cynara cardunculus, in vades grasslands, but mechanisms are unknown. Here I report on studies of weed traits and grassland invasibility factors. I measured seed produc tion, dispersal, and storage as well as seedling numbers, microsite, growth, and flowering for three years in three invaded grassland sites. Traits of C. cardunculus only partially matched those as reported for weedy species in the scientific literature and included: Recruitment over a range of site con ditions, annual seed crop production associated with rainfall, limited long distance dispersal, limited presence in grassland seed banks, seedling re cruitment both under vegetation and in gaps, rapid seedling growth, low seedling herbivory, low numbers flowering at the end of the second grow ing season, and relatively low nitrogen requirements. In a preliminary anal ysis of factors associated with weed invasion, steep slopes, clay soils, and high density and cover of pocket gopher mounds were positively associated with C. cardunculus cover and density. Native perennial bunchgrass cover and density were negatively associated with weed cover and density. I used a factorial experiment to test hypotheses about biotic and abiotic predictors of grassland invasibility. I found that some biotic disturbances (pocket go phers) were important for weed establishment, while mammalian herbivory, especially granivory, was not influential. An abiotic factor (added moisture) interacted significantly with the simulated pocket gopher mound treatment to positively affect weed seedling establishment in the grassland. DEUTSCHMAN, D.

Challenges in survey design and data analysis of a long-term study: Lessons from a 17-year study of Bowhead Whales in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. One of the greatest limitations in making informed management decisions is the absence of long-term data on population dynamics. The Bowhead Whale Aerial Survey Project (BWASP) is an impressive survey in which nearly 2000 endangered bowhead whales were sighted along 3000 aerial transects over 17 years. The BWASP study was designed as a stratified random sample with strata corresponding to sections of the Alaskan Beau fort Sea. Sampling effort, defined as the number of transects flown, varied dramatically. More than 70% of transect were flown in Onshore strata and this proportion varied from year to year and month to month. The number of whales per transect was strongly skewed with most transects resulting in no sightings but with occasional large aggregations. In fact, 2% of the transects accounted for more than 28% of the whales seen in the entire study. In order to reduce the impact of this skewness, sighting data was transformed using a simple presence/absence criterion. Analysis of this transformed sighting variable suggests that whale populations are highly variable. Sighting success ranged from a low of 6% in 1985 to a high of 31% in 1990, 1995, and 1997. Whales were more likely to be found On shore (18.1%) rather than Offshore (6.9%). This gradient varied from year to year and with time of year. Sampling effort was correlated with sighting success, which suggests significant bias in the selection of transects to be flown. The location of transects were positively autocorrelated within a season further demonstrating sampling bias. These results suggest that more attention needs to be paid to survey design and implementation for long term population monitoring. Stratified Random Sampling and Adaptive Sampling are attractive alternatives to Simple Random Sampling. More complex survey designs are more vulnerable to the vagaries of logistics and the tyranny of incremental decision making. DIAL, R. Alaska Pacific University, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA. On the shape of species richness xurves: Area, latitude, disturbance, and pro ductivity. Using a simple function relating species richness (S) to total abundance (A), minimum population (m), niche availability (0 = n = 1), and historical influences (h) as S=h(A/m)n, I explore some of the consequences of en vironmental variability in these community variables. In particular, analysis of the model shows: (1) If the predominant effect of increasing area is a linear increase of total abundance, then species-area curves are concave down. (2) If a greater effect of increasing area is a linear increase in niche availability, then a log-log plot of area and richness is concave up. (3) If the predominant effect of increasing latitude is a linear increase in mini mum population, then latitudinal gradients of species richness are concave up. (4) If increasing disturbance linearly decreases abundance and linearly increases niche availability, then the relationship between richness and dis turbance is humped and left skewed. (5) If increasing productivity linearly increases abundance, while linearly decreasing niche availability, then the relationship between richness and productivity is humped and right skewed. Together with other results (Rapoport's Rule, nestedness in species lists from island archipelagos, and the positive relation between abundance and distribution) shown last year, I suggest this to be the most robust general theory of species richness yet presented.

Chestnut oak (Quercus pri nus L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) stump sprouts, ectomycorrhi za, and red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings. We examined the influence of existing vegetation on mycorrhizal infection, nutrition and growth of red oak (Quercus rubra L.) seedlings in a site that had burned and was logged 8 years previously. Vegetation on the site con sisted of stump sprouts of oak (ectomycorrhizal) and red maple (VA my corrhizal) in a matrix of VA mycorrhizal grasses and forbs, and ericoid mycorrhizal shrubs. For two years, we grew red oak seedlings near re sprouted stumps of 1) chestnut oak (Q. prinus L.) or 2) red maple (Acer rubrum L.). In the second year we also grew red oak seedlings near oak stumps that had not resprouted. In years 1 and 2, seedlings germinated near resprouted chestnut oak stumps had 478% and 185% more ectomycorrhizal root tips cm-', 303% and 59% higher shoot N concentration, and 292% and 49% higher shoot P concentration than seedlings planted near resprouted red maple stumps (all P &lt; 0.05). Seedlings germinated near resprouted chestnut oak stumps were also infected by a different community of my corrhizal fungi than in the other treatments. Seedlings germinated near resprouted chestnut oaks in the first year grew 80% taller than seedlings near resprouted red maple (P &lt; 0.05). Seedlings germinated in the second year did not show significant differences in growth, perhaps due to severe drought conditions. Seedlings germinated near unsprouted oak stumps had ectomycorrhizal infection, and shoot N and P concentrations similar to seedlings germinated near maples. There were no differences between treat ments in soil pH, or available P, NH4+ or NO3-. These results show that living root systems of existing ectomycorrhizal vegetation can provide an important source of mycorrhizal symbionts for red oak seedlings, influenc ing the quantity and quality of colonization. Ultimately, this can result in increased seedling growth and may play a role in forest successional dy namics. DICKINSON, M. B. and E. A. JOHNSON. University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Effects of deciduous and conifer fuels on predicted fire extinction in the mixedwood boreal forest. Deciduous and conifer fuels are thought to differ in their effects on fire extinction. To test this expectation, we used a semi-empirical model to estimate the probability that fires would go out over a range of fuel mois ture conditions. In the model, extinction is determined by a ratio of heat 86 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="48">sources to heat sinks. Fuel particle low heats of combustion and surface area-to-volume ratios and fuel loading and depth affect the heat source. The heat required to complete fuel pyrolysis determines the heat sink. Part of the heat sink is accounted for by the heat required to vaporize water which is dependent on fuel moisture calculated from weather records. In stands &gt;30 years old (i.e., &gt;30 years since the last fire), fires were pre dicted to go out with a probability of 1 on 25% of days in deciduous dominated stands and 15% of days in conifer-dominated stands during the 1955 to 1998 fire seasons. Consistent with these results, fuel loadings and surface-area-to-volume ratios were lower in deciduous-dominated stands. Though deciduous fuels may inhibit fire spread in older stands during moist periods, in stands &lt;= 12 years old, the probability of fire extinction dropped with the amount of deciduous basal area. This result suggests that fuels accumulate more rapidly where regrowth after fire has a large decid uous component. We conclude that during dry periods, only the youngest stands will not carry a fire, but during moist periods, fuel variability be comes increasingly important in determining where on the landscape a fire will or will not spread. DIEHL, S. and M. FEISSEL. University of Munich, 80333 Munich, Ger many. Effects of enrichment on a 3-level food chain with omnivory. We investigated enrichment effects on a system of a resource (R), an in termediate consumer (N), and an omnivore (P, feeding on R and N) using a general model. We then tested the relevance of four major predictions to a laboratory system of bacteria (= R) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (= N) and Blepharisma (= P): 1) Stable persistence of all three species is only possible, if N can persist on R alone at lower levels of enrichment than can P. This was true for the ciliate system. 2) N may facilitate or inhibit P. Enrichment may revert the effect of N on P from facilitation to inhibi tion. Tetrahymena always facilitated Blepharisma. Facilitation was highest at low enrichment. 3) Along an enrichment gradient, up to four regions of invasibility and coexistence of N and P may exist. At low enrichment, only R persists. At somewhat higher enrichment, R coexists with N. At inter mediate enrichment, either N and P can coexist or either consumer excludes the other. At high enrichment, P can subsist on R alone and N may be excluded. The persistence pattern of Tetrahymena and Blepharisma con formed largely to this scenario. 4) Where all three species coexist stably, R always increases and N always decreases with enrichment. This was true for the ciliate system. The results caution that patterns of trophic level abundances along enrichment gradients predicted by food chain theory are not to be expected in systems with significant omnivory.

Calcium uptake from different soil depths explains chemical differences between surface soils under sugar maple or ash and under hemlock. Surface soils under either sugar maple or ash had significantly higher soil pH and available calcium than those under hemlock. Trees could affect the pool of available calcium from deeper soil layers through uptake of calcium by deep roots and bringing it back to the surface in litterfall, followed by calcium mineralization. To test the importance of this mechanism, a simple calcium budget was made for sites with different tree species. Atmospheric input of calcium was measured with bulk deposition collectors and calcium weathering in the soil was investigated by using strontium isotopes. Cal cium leaching at 20 cm was calculated by combining modeled hydrology with measured calcium soil solution concentration at 20 cm depth. The strontium isotope study showed that calcium weathering in the first 20 cm of the soil was not as much influenced by tree species as by the parent material of the soil. However, calcium leaching at 20 cm depth appeared much higher for sugar maple and white ash than for hemlock. The calcium budgets suggested that the deep rooting species sugar maple and white ash take up significant amounts of calcium from deep soil layers below 20 cm. The shallow rooting hemlock takes up little calcium from deeper soil layers and the calcium that is leached out below the rooting zone is lost perma nently. Over time, pumping could be an important mechanism for trees with deep root systems to sustain high levels of available calcium in the surface soil. DIXON, M. D. and M. G. TURNER. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA. Temporal variation in abundance and composition of pioneer seedling cohorts of riparian trees: Influence of river flow var iation. Riparian vegetation dynamics are influenced by the interaction of species specific demographic processes and fluvial geomorphic processes, both of which vary in space and time. We investigated the influence of river flow variation and timing on the species composition of first year seedling co horts of pioneer riparian tree species, during 1997-1999, on sandbars in the Wisconsin River. Relative and absolute abundances of seedlings varied greatly among the years, which also differed in their growing season hy drographs. Betula nigra comprised 83% of the seedling cohort in 1997, a year in which the flows remained relatively low and stable following the recession of the spring peak, but was only a minor component in 1998 (13%) and 1999 (&lt;1%), years characterized by mid-season flow pulses that may have caused high mortality to recent germinants. The 1998 pulse occurred in late June, near the end of the Betula dispersal interval, and the 1999 pulse occurred in late July, after all species had completed dispersal. Both the 1998 and 1999 cohorts had low overall seedling density. Salix species, which had a wide dispersal interval, made up about two-thirds of the seedlings in 1998 (Salix exigua 24%, Salix sp. 40%), but were nearly absent in 1999 (&lt;1%). The 1999 cohort was dominated by Acer sacchar inum (89%), the earliest dispersing species. These results suggest that var iation in species composition of sandbar colonists among years is heavily influenced by the interaction between time of dispersal and the magnitude and timing of river flows. We conclude that interannual variation in river flow is an important control on species composition of pioneer seedling cohorts, which may influence successional trajectories in riparian forests.

Scale transition theory predicts changes in population dynamics across spa tial scale due to the interaction between local density dependence and var iation in population density across patches. This transition enhances re gional stability by making regional dynamics less temporally variable than local dynamics. Stronger scale transitions are expected with patchy resource distributions or low rates of between-population dispersal. We tested how dispersal, resource distribution, and density dependence affect scale tran sitions in single-species microcosms. Our study spanned at least 150 gen erations. Microcosms consisted of four bottles connected by tubes to create different dispersal levels. All microcosms had equal amounts of total re sources but varied in resource distribution. The amount of density depen dence was manipulated by using three species. Perturbation experiments, together with fitting of logistic models, showed 10-fold differences in the strength of density dependence (the second derivative of the logistic equa tion, r/K) among these species. The species with the least density depen dence showed significantly more temporal variability in regional dynamics than the other two species. For Colpidium, low-dispersal microcosms showed lower temporal variability in regional dynamics than microcosms with high or no dispersal. Non-linear time series techniques were used to fit a logistic model to each patch. The mean of the patch models was then used to predict the microcosm dynamics. The difference between predicted and observed dynamics within entire microcosms was used as a measure of the extent of the scale transition. Results supported the prediction of scale transition theory: Larger differences occurred in microcosms with the lowest dispersal, highest resource variability, or the species with the stron gest density dependence. Our study shows that scale-transition theory is a useful tool for synthesizing ideas about spatial dynamics. DONG, Q. Florida International University, Miami, Fl. USA. Detritivory, trophic shunt and the apparent trophic cascade hypothesis. Detritus is a universal component of ecosystems. In a majority of ecosys tems, most primary production is uneaten by herbivores and turns into detritus. Many animals feed on detritus and then become food items of predators. These predators also often prey on herbivores. Thus, energy and material may shunt from detrital food chains into the classic herbivore food chain. In many ecosystems, the flow to the upper trophic levels through Oral Presentation Abstracts 87</page><page sequence="49">detritivore channel can be equal or larger than that through the herbivore channel. I constructed a model to examine the features of a food web that contains both herbivore and detritivore food chains and the features of trophic shunt. The model simulated trophic interactions among six groups: edible autotrophs, inedible autotrophs, detritus, herbivores, detritivores, and predators. In such food webs, an apparent trophic cascade may arise, which contains a large standing crop of predators, a disproportionately small standing crop of herbivores, and very abundant primary producers. Some ecosystems may look greener than others even if their primary productivity is more severely limited by nutrients. The aquatic food web of the Ever glades marshes appears to show this pattern.

Over a period of five days in August 1997 simultaneous measurements of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) were made, using open top cham bers (OTC's) and eddy covariance. This experiment was conducted in an evergreen scrub-oak palmetto ecosystem in Florida, on a site that had burned 15 months previously. Although there were differences between the microclimate inside and outside the OTC's, maximum rates of day NEE, and night NEE were in good agreement for the two techniques. At high PPFD, NEE was unaffected by measurement technique. At low PPFD, NEE was higher in the OTC's. The response of NEE to air temperature was in good agreement for the two techniques, with a broad temperature optimum for NEE between 35 and 42?C. DOUHOVNIKOFF, V. University of California, Berkeley CA 94720, USA. Spatial clonal pattern of Salix laevigata in varying riparian environ ments. Salix laevigata has two means of reproduction; sexual by dissemination of seeds, and asexual by sprouting from vegetative material. Assuming a mod el for the reproduction and spread of willows, whereby seeding leads to the colonization of sites over large distances, with the further occupation of those sites through suckering, a patchy clonal pattern would be estab lished. We make the working hypothesis that under conditions where re production by seed is high, clonal patches are small, and genetic variability is high. Under conditions where asexual reproduction predominates clonal patches are large, and genetic variability is relatively low. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of seed reproduction vs. asexual reproduction under a range of environmental conditions, by determining the relative size of clonal patches. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were tested for their ability to identify Salix lae vigata clones in a trial of greenhouse grown half sibs vs. samples of clonal material. Genetic distance values between clones were significantly lower than the genetic distance values between half sibs. Therefore, using AFLPs we were able to distinguish and map distinct genetic individuals. Our data showed genetic variability in natural populations was significantly lower than that found among greenhouse-raised half-sib seedlings from the same population. This suggested significant levels of recruitment through asexual reproduction. Smaller clones were found in the upstream half of point bars and more extensive clones were found in the downstream half of point bars. Data also suggested significant differences in genetic variability and clonal pattern between populations that occupy sites subject to different stream flow patterns. DOWNING, A. L. The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637. Species, functional groups, diversity and composition: What regulates ecosys tem function and stability? Species ultimately control energy and material flow through ecosystems. Here I describe work in which I ask if simplified descriptions of species in food webs, including species diversity and composition, and functional group diversity and composition, can be used to predict ecosystem function and stability. I independently manipulated species diversity, species com position, functional group diversity, and functional group composition in semi-natural pond mesocosms. Functional groups included macrophytes, herbivores, and invertebrate predators. Each food web was crossed with control and pulsed acidification treatments to explore the effects of food web structure on ecosystem stability. Ecosystem responses included pro ductivity, respiration, nutrients, and community biomass. All food web properties had significant effects on some aspect of ecosystem function, however species composition and functional group composition had par ticularly strong effects. Ecosystem stability, quantified as resistance and resilience, was also sensitive to the underlying food web structure. More diverse communities tended to have increased resilience of productivity and respiration. Breaking food webs down into individual species' contri butions to overall ecosystem function revealed that many species have large effects while others have little effect on function. These results suggest that although all aspects of food web structure are important for ecosystem function, the composition of species within a community largely determines function. However diversity effects may still be important in determining the response of ecosystems to disturbance. DRAKE, D. R. and K. G. MCALPINE. Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand. Regeneration from seed in artificial treefall gaps: Replacing plantation pine with native forest in New Zealand. Treefall gaps were created in a relictual Pinus radiata plantation in New Zealand to determine how pine removal would affect regeneration by native and alien plants during forest restoration. Based on exposure to sunlight, gaps were divided into five microsite types (plus closed-canopy controls) in which seedling emergence and establishment were measured. Seedling emergence from the seed bank, measured 10 wk after gap formation in 216 transplanted, homogenized soil samples, was positively correlated with ex posure and ranged from 8624/M2 in the sunniest microsites to 4235/M2 in the shadiest microsites, and 3331/M2 in the controls. The addition of 3cm of pine leaf litter promoted seedling emergence in sites exposed to sunlight but affected emergence less consistently elsewhere. Alien seedlings com prised 23% of the individuals in the sunniest microsites, but only 13% in closed forest. In 180 permanent plots examined one yr after gap formation, seedling establishment ranged from 10/iM2 in the sunniest microsites to 42/M2 in the shadiest microsites, and 4/m2 under closed forest. Alien shrubs (chiefly Cytisus scoparius) comprised 68% of the seedlings in the sunniest microsites, but only 20% in closed forest. Results suggest that pines may be replaced by native trees without an intervening alien shrub stage if pines are slowly thinned over time, thus minimizing exposure of soil to direct sunlight.

Root decomposition and nutrient budgets in roots from an oak-hickory forest in southern Ohio: Influence of landscape position and fire regime. We investigated how changes in the soil microclimate from prescribed burning altered root decomposition and nutrient budgets in an oak-hickory forest in southern Ohio. We compared root nutrient concentrations, root decomposition and nutrient release in three watersheds that experienced different prescribed burning regimes: An unburned control, a watershed that was burned twice over four years (1996 and 1999), and a watershed that was burned four consecutive years (1996-1999). Root decomposition was measured in the field using root litterbags (10 cm X 10 cm, 2 mm mesh) containing approximately 1 g of oven-dried roots. Within each treat ment watershed, sets of root litterbags were placed in xeric, intermediate and mesic moisture class plots. Soil moisture was consistently 1-3% lower and soil temperature consistently 2C greater in the burned plots throughout the growing season. Root biomass loss between June and September was significantly greater in the unburned control site, presumably due to higher soil moisture during this period in the control site. By December there was no difference in the root biomass remaining among treatments. Overall, the decomposition rate (k) calculated from a linear model was approximately -1.0 in all treatments combined and did not differ significantly among treat ments. 88 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="50">DREWA, P.

Changes in community structure of herbaceous species to single growing season fires, livestock grazing, and presence of shrubs were investigated experimentally in Chihuahuan desert grasslands in southern NM. Eight, 12m by 8m plots were established in each of two different blocks. Treat ments were allocated to plots at two levels: Applied and not applied. More over, each of the eight treatment combinations of fire, grazing, and shrubs were assigned randomly to one of the eight plots within each block. Fires were applied during June 1995 after which plots received only 49% of precipitation expected for the rainy season of July; unfenced plots were subsequently exposed to dormant season grazing over the next four years. Plots were established to either include or exclude existing shrubs. Cover and relative abundance of herbaceous species were estimated immediately prior to and four years following treatments using a vertical line point intercept method along five, 8m transects within each plot. Perennial grass cover decreased 13% but increased 5% in burned and unburned plots re spectively (P = 0.017). Also, relative abundance of perennial grasses de creased 30% more in burned than unburned areas (P = 0.004). These responses were attributed almost entirely to Bouteloua eriopoda, the dom inant perennial grass species. Conversely, cover (P &lt; 0.001) and relative abundance (P &lt; 0.001) of perennial forbs were greater in burned than unburned plots. Similar to fire responses, cover and relative abundance of perennial grasses and forbs changed in much the same way between grazed and ungrazed plots. Annuals generally increased in cover and relative abun dance regardless of fire and grazing. Herbaceous species were not impacted by the presence of shrubs. These results suggest that fires had similar ef fects as grazing on community structure. Treatments did little to eliminate species. Instead, fire and grazing were effective in decreasing dominant perennial grasses such as B. eriopoda that coincided with appreciable in creases in coverage and relative abundance of mostly perennial forbs and some annuals. Growing season fires may alter communities similar to an thropogenic grazing if the timing of fires do not coincide with appropriate synoptic weather conditions. DUKES, J. S.

I constructed grassland microcosms to study how species composition, spe cies richness, and soil disturbance affect the susceptibility of California grassland to invasion by Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle), and how Centaurea invasion affects community productivity. I constructed mono cultures to study competition between Centaurea and species from four different functional groups. I created multi-species communities that dif fered in species richness, but not funcional group richness, to determine how species diversity affects the invasibility of plant communities. I intro duced Centaurea into both newly-constructed and 1-year old microcosms of each community type to study how simulated disturbance affected com munity invasibility. For each community type, I compared productivity between microcosms with and without Centaurea to assess how starthistle invasions affect grassland productivity. Invasibility (Centaurea biomass production) was a decreasing, asymptotic function of species richness in both the new and 1-year old communities. The age of the communities affected their invasibility. Surprisingly, the proportion of total community biomass made up by Centaurea was greater in 1-year old communities than in new communities, with the exception of the perennial grass treatments. Although several monocultures increased total biomass production in re sponse to Centaurea invasion, multi-species communities and monocul tures of late-season annual forbs did not. Competition with Centaurea sig nificantly decreased productionof resident species in several communities. In new microcosms, Centaurea significantly decreased production of resi dent species in several communities. In new microcosms, Centaurea de pressed the production of resident species more in simple communities than in diverse communities. This effect of diversity on the response of resident species to the invader was not evident in the 1-year old microcosms. Re sults from this study generally support the hypothesis that diverse com munities resist invasion more successfully than simple communities. The results also suggest that, in some cases, diversity may decrease the impact of invasion on resident species.. DUKES, J.

Dynamac Corporation, Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. A spatial time series: Dynamics of openings in oak scrub vegetation. Sand openings in oak scrub vegetation are important features for scrub biota. Fires create and maintain them; little information exists on their dynamics in space and time at the landscape scale. Recent historic land scape analysis of Happy Creek on Kennedy Space Center found the ma jority of openings transient, closing in the absence of fire, while some remained persistent during fire suppression. We used historic and current aerial photos to map openings into a GIS database where a change detection identified transient vs. stable openings. To help land managers in creating and managing openings, we used this spatial information to facilitate field data collection. We navigated to openings using a real time differentially corrected global positioning system and collected data on major and minor axis lengths, depth of depression measured in relation to surrounding ground height, probe depth to resistant soil layers, soil core profiles, and surrounding species composition. We sampled openings in the center of well-drained ridges (N=22), in the ecotone to mesic vegetation (N= 1), anthropogenic openings (N= 10) associated with previous clearings, and transient openings (N= 10). Area, major axis depth, and minor axis depth differed among types (Kruskal-Wallis, p&lt;O.OO1). Disturbed openings were largest (49.5m2), center (7.4m2), ecotone (8.3m2), and transitory the small est (1.1 IM2). The ecotone openings had the deepest average depth with the ridge center, disturbance, and transitory openings following. Persistent openings occurred in microtopographic depressions and disturbed areas. DUNNING, C. E.,' T. D. PAINE' and R. A.

To determine potential damage of a common generalist insect herbivore on oak seedlings, we conducted performance and preference tests with a grass hopper and two species of oaks occurring in a southern California oak grassland. To quantify herbivore performance, we measured leaf area of 30 Quercus agrifolia and 30 Quercus engelmannii seedlings and caged them individually within acetate feeding arenas. Sixty fourth-instar Melanoplus sanguinipes were collected from Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve and placed in the individual feeding cages. We measured final dry weights of all frass and grasshoppers after a 20-day feeding period. To determine preference between the two species of seedlings, we placed 30 M. sangui nipes into paired feeding chambers and measured extent of leaf area feeding damage after 14 days. M. sanguinipes consumed significantly more leaf area and produced significantly more frass when feeding only on Q. agri folia (P&lt;0.001). Additionally, grasshoppers feeding on Q. agrifolia gained significantly more biomass (P&lt;0.001), whereas those feeding on Q. en gelmannii actually lost biomass. This research determined the preference and performance of M. sanguinipes when provided with only oak seedlings upon which to feed and indicates potential damage this common grasshop per can do in restoration studies with the threatened Engelmann oak.

Seasonal relations between hy drology and subsurface carbon inputs from a riparian meadow to a second-order stream. Subsurface inputs of dissolved organic matter from riparian areas to streams are strongly influenced by seasonal hydrology, riparian vegetation and soils, and microbial processes. Our objectives were: (1) To characterize the hydrology of a riparian meadow; and (2) to estimate seasonal subsur face inputs of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the meadow to the stream. The study site (250 m by 80 m) borders an unconstrained reach of a second-order tributary to the Grande Ronde River, northeast Oregon (el evation 1320 m). We monitored water table elevation in a grid-like network of wells from spring 1997 to fall 1999, and found that subsurface flow was generally down valley and towards the stream. We also measured DOC in stream water and shallow ground water from a subset of wells located in three floodplain plant communities-wet, moist, and dry meadow. Con centrations of DOC in subsurface water were lowest during spring snow melt (mean = 5.4; SD = 1.2 mg/I), when low water temperatures limited microbial activity, and highest during late summer at base flow (mean = 28.5; SD = 3.8 mg/1). Average concentrations of DOC in stream water ranged from 2.1 to 11.8 mg/I, and were highest following rain storms in fall. When adjusted for discharge, however, DOC levels in stream water were greatest during spring run-off, when much of the meadow was flood ed. The role of meadows as sources of DOC may vary seasonally, de pending on interactions among hydrology, soils, vegetation, and terrestrial and aquatic microbial processes. DYER, L. A. Mesa State College, Grand Junction, CO 81502, USA. Tro phic cascades in tropical versus temperate systems. Current hypotheses about tritrophic interactions predict that indirect posi tive effects of predators and parasitoids on plant fitness (top-down trophic cascades) are less likely to occur in complex versus simple trophic webs. However, studies in complex tropical ecosystems have demonstrated that top-down cascades can account for at least some of the variation in plant biomass and can affect plant fitness. To directly compare effect sizes of natural enemies on lower trophic levels in complex versus simple terrestrial food webs, I conducted a meta-analysis on 15 years of data collected from tropical and temperate systems. I also used the meta-analysis to compare top-down forces with the bottom-up effects of resource variability on plants and upper trophic levels. Latitudinal trends across the three trophic levels of plant, herbivore, and natural enemies indicate that compared to temperate ecosystems, the tropics exhibit more intense pressure from natural enemies, higher levels of herbivory, and more effective plant defenses. There were no differences in the effects of resources on plants, and despite predictions to the contrary from current hypotheses, there were no latitudinal differ ences in indirect effects of enemies on plants. In tropical systems, the effects of natural enemies on herbivores were greater than the effects of tropical plant defenses on herbivores. In contrast, while the effects of en emies on herbivores were large for temperate studies, the effects of tem perate plant defenses on herbivores were significantly larger. Results from empirical studies that I have conducted with others corroborate these gen eral trends. This major difference between tropical and temperate com munities has very important implications for ecological and evolutionary relationships between plants, herbivores and natural enemies. For example, some current hypotheses suggest that natural enemies are more important in limiting the diet breadth of herbivores than plant chemistry. However, this might not be as tenable in temperate systems where, according to the meta-analysis, plant chemistry has a greater effect on herbivore biomass and survivorship than natural enemies.

The effects of CO2 and landuse change using synchronously coupled meteorological and plant models. A meteorological model, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), and a plant model, the General Energy and Mass Transfer Model (GEMTM), are synchronously coupled in this study. The modeling system was then used to investigate the regional effects in the central grasslands of the United States when: a) land cover is changed from current to poten tial vegetation, b) radiative forcing is changed from ambient CO2 to 2 fold greater CO2, and c) biological CO2 partial pressures are doubled. The model results indicate that the biological effect of enriched C02, and landuse change exhibit dominant effects on meteorological and biological fields on this regional scale. This was found at daily to seasonal time scales, and grid to regional spatial scales. The radiation impacts of 2 fold CO2 are minimal, with interactive effects between the three areas of investigation as large as the radiational impact. The model results suggest that the 2 fols CO2 biological effect would exert significant effects on weather in this region. EBER, S.,I H. P. SMITH,' R. K. DIDHAM2 and H. V.

It is by no means clear how eruptive insect herbivores differ in their control mechanisms compared to regulated species. We compared two closely re lated holly leaf-miner species, one of which exhibits outbreaks. Phytomyza ilicicola in the eastern US and P. ilicis in the UK share many ecological traits and have similar life cycles, but P. ilicicola reaches infestation levels of well over one mine per leaf, while P. ilicis is tightly regulated at much lower densities. Using data from the literature and from our own field studies, we tried to find the reasons for these contrasting dynamics. P. ilicicola in the US varied widely in mortality and infestation levels, reach ing local densities of over ten mines per leaf. In contrast, P. ilicis in the UK showed high mortality and low infestation at all sites. P. ilicicola oviposits into the leaf lamina and experiences weak larval competition only at high densities. P. ilicis oviposits only in the midrib, which leads to high mortality of young larvae before mine formation. Multiply-mined leaves were thus very common in P.ilicicola but were rare in P. ilicis. Differences in the parasitoid complexes of the two systems accounted for further dif ferences in survival to adulthood. The main (larval) parasitoid, which was found to impose high, density-dependent mortality on P. ilicis is missing on P. ilicicola. It is replaced by an egg-pupal parasitoid, which varies in its impact at different sites. Multiple emergence of adults from multiply mined leaves is therefore widespread in P. ilicicola, but does not occur in P. ilicis. The differences in oviposition behavior and in the parasitoid com plexes are likely to allow P. ilicicola to outbreak when habitat conditions are favorable, while P. ilicis is always tightly regulated.

The role of disturbance in influencing ecosystems is well recognized in ecology. Disturbances span a range of extent, duration, frequency, and while the understanding of small frequent disturbances is rapidly advanc ing, the ecological effects of large infrequent disturbances are not well understood. During three years (1997-1999) of seasonal sampling of the fish community and water quality in a North Carolina estuary, the system experienced periodic hypoxia, occurring on the scale of days to weeks and meters to kilometers, throughout the summer. In the fall of 1999, North Carolina experienced several hurricanes and major flooding in coastal rivers and estuaries. In September, record high inflows into the Neuse reduced salinities in most of the estuary to 0 ppt. Lower estuarine areas, where deeper bottom salinities remained above 0 ppt, experienced stratification and bottom waters became hypoxic. We evaluated predictions, based on our experiences with small frequent disturbances, for the responses of the fish community (e.g., abundance, diversity, habitat utilization, and rate of return) to this flooding. Although these events occur at very different scales, they have many similar attributes. For example, many species ex perienced a threshold response where catches of most fish species drop an order of magnitude in the disturbed area. Predictions failed more often in estuarine areas where fish were exposed to multiple stresses (unlike in our small frequent disturbances). ECKHART, V. M., J. D. HANSEN, C. M. LA GRANGE and E. N.

Evolutionary ecology of a petal-spot polymorphism in Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana (Onagra ceae): Floral landmarks affect herbivore resistance, not pollinator vis itation. Pigmented "landmarks" on flowers are often hypothesized to have evolved through selection to attract animal pollinators. Populations of Clarkia xan tiana ssp. xantiana, a bee-pollinated annual, are highly polymorphic for the presence (and size) of dark spots on petals. This suggests that some form of balancing selection, imposed by pollinators and/or other factors, plays a role in maintaining the polymorphism. We investigated this possi bility in studies of pollinator behavior, phenotypic selection, and quantita tive genetics. In experimental arrays, petal-spot area had no effect on pol linator visitation rate (though total petal area had an expected positive ef fect). In some populations we detected significant stabilizing selection on petal-spot area (with respect to seed production). Two relationships con tributed to this stabilizing selection. First, petal-spot area correlated nega tively with fruit predation. Second, petal-spot area was found to be nega tively genetically correlated with the node of first flowering, a trait that ongoing field studies have shown to be under upward directional selection in C. xantiana ssp. xantiana. These findings support recent ideas that her bivore resistance might influence the evolution of flower pigmentation and that trade-offs occur between herbivore defense and fecundity. Surprisingly, this study did not support the idea that the floral landmarks function as pollinator attractants. EDGAR, C. W. and G. W. KOCH. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, U.S.A. Stomatal response to elevated CO2 changes with seasonal water availability in pinyon pine and juniper. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are reported to reduce stomatal con ductance (gs) in many plants, potentially decreasing water stress. Despite its significant role in determining future ecosystem water and carbon bal ance, data on the conductance response of woody species is relatively scarce. Water-use strategies often vary among dominant woody species; therefore, physiological differences may result in differential impacts on water use under elevated CO2. This study examined two co-occurring tree species, Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma, which differ in drought tolerance and transpirational patterns. In contrast to J. monosperma, P. edulis has been shown to be less drought tolerant and exhibits higher water use efficiency (WUE). We measured the leaf-level g, response of each species to one-hour increases (1.5-times ambient) in CO2 during the grow ing season. This short-term CO2 increase was designed to measure the initial stomatal response in the field. During late June and July, prior to summer rain events, high CO2 resulted in gs reductions of 8.6% and 24.7% in P. edulis and J. monosperma, respectively. However, in September, after heavy rains, changes in g, under high CO2 were attenuated; +0.31% in P. edulis and -6.0% in J. monosperma. Because stomatal closure under high CO2 was enhanced during periods of lower soil moisture, we suggest that reduction in gs may best benefit WUE under drier conditions. Perhaps P. edulis shows less overall stomatal response to high CO2 due to its inher ently greater WUE. EDMONDS, S. N. Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA. Evalu ation of surface mine reforestation in south-central West Virginia. Implementation of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) has had a negative effect on mined land reforestation. Federal and state regulations have enforced sediment control, surface sta bility and complete ground cover following surface mining. In response, mine sites are mostly seeded with quick-growing, exotic grass species to control erosion. Seed or seedling tree species are often planted in compact fill material engineered for stability but unsuitable for proper root and shoot growth. A survey was conducted at six postmining restoration sites in the Coal River Valley, West Virginia to assess reforestation efforts. All sites had been revegetated with grasses, herbaceous legumes and woody species and ranged in age from two to twelve years of growth. Percentage cover by woody and herbaceous species was determined in two-meter square quadrats placed mechanically along transect lines. Seven distinctive post mining landforms evaluated had statistically significant differences in per cent cover for grasses, herbaceous legumes, woody species and bare ground (p-value less than 0.0001) using ANOVA model. Native woody species accounted for less than 11 percent of the vegetation cover indicating low survival of planted trees and shrubs and low occurrence of woody colo nization from adjacent forests. Exotic grasses and herbaceous legumes cov ered approximately 80 percent of the revegetated landforms. EDWARDS, R. and T O'KEEFE. University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195. Nutrient dynamics in SW Alaskan Sockeye streams: What role do fish play? Spawning salmon bring large amounts of nutrients to natal streams, fertil izing them and increasing the production of algae, invertebrates and fish. Research using stable isotopes has suggested that even riparian forest growth is enhanced by salmon carcasses, although the nutrient transfer mechanisms are poorly understood. We describe a study in the Wood River Lakes region in southwest Alaska designed to determine the extent of hy porheic transfer of marine-derived nutrients to the riparian zone of Lynx Creek, a sockeye spawning stream. A piezometer grid was installed within a floodplain meander bend. Conservative tracer injections and constituent maps were used to determine the extent of hyporheic flows and detect salmon-derived nutrients within the subsurface. Hyporheic flows, with 2 day residence times, were detected beneath the entire floodplain meander. Oral Presentation Abstracts 91</page><page sequence="53">Neither nitrogen nor phosphorus increased within surface or subsurface waters during or after spawning. Within nearby watersheds, pre and post fish run nitrogen concentrations were related to proximity to upland alder stands, not to presence or absence of a sockeye spawning run. Flux budgets revealed that salmon provide less than 4% of annual stream nitrogen flux, making it unlikely that marine nitrogen within the stream is a significant influence on stream or riparian primary production. However, salmon phos phorus inputs were about 123% of the phosphorus flux. Because nitrogen and phosphorus are decoupled during inorganic nutrient transformations, stable nitrogen isotopes are a poor tracer of marine phosphorus pathways at this site, and may significantly underestimate the importance of marine phosphorus in these rivers.

Elevated CO2 concentrations can adversely affect acclimation to freezing temperatures in temperate evergreens, but the mechanism(s) is unknown. One possibility is that reduction in foliar nitrogen concentrations induced by growth under elevated CO2 concentrations could adversely affect freez ing tolerance. We tested this hypothesis by growing seedlings of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) under field conditions in three nitrogen treatments in open-topped chambers flushed with either ambient air or air enriched with CO2 to twice normal levels (350 and 700 ppm, respectively). Plants were subject to several light frosts of 0 to -1 oC in the first three weeks of growth in autumn. However, minimum temperature on 25 April dropped to -6.4 oC at seedling canopy height within the chambers. Three days later, seedlings growing under ambient [C02] had lost an average of 0.4% of total leaf area to freeze-induced necrosis. In contrast, seedlings grown under elevated [C02] lost an average of 33% of total leaf area. Freeze-induced injury under elevated [C02] was partially alleviated by nitrogen nutrition, with the median loss in leaf area for plants grown under high, medium and low nitrogen regimes being 24, 31 and 44%, respectively. All plants grew vigorously in autumn, with the most rapidly growing plants in the highest nitrogen treatment suffering the least freeze damage. Leaves without visible freezing injury also showed a greater loss in FJ/Fm under elevated [C02], with values averaging 0.686 and 0.425 under ambient and elevated [C02], respectively. These results confirm earlier reports of enhanced susceptibility to freeze damage in plants grown under elevated [C02], and have far reach ing consequences for prediction of plant performance in a future high [C02] world.

Intraspecific divergence along sharp ecological gradients is thought to be a first step in the process of sympatric speciation. Local adaptation may lead to reproductive isolation without geographic isolation if two require ments are met. First, the characters that are under divergent selection should be genetically based and heritable. Second, these characters should be as sociated with characters involved in mate choice, so that migrating indi viduals have a reduced mating success compared to the resident, adapted phenotypes. We studied local adaptation in the butterfly Colias philodice eriphyle along an elevational gradient in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Significant differences were found in life history and thermoregulatory characters among elevations. At high elevations, wing melanization in creased compared to low elevation populations, which is consistent with the differences in environmental conditions. Laboratory experiments show that wing melanization has a high heritability of 76%. In field experiments, we showed that wing melanization is significantly correlated with mating success. In females in low elevation populations, we found a negative re lationship between the number of matings and the degree of wing mela nization. Also, individuals differing in wing melanization flew at different times throughout the day, thereby reducing the possibilities for mating. These results demonstrate that intraspecific divergence has the potential to increase reproductive isolation between Colias populations at different el evations. ELLIS, J. C. Brown University, Providence, RI. 02912, USA. Gull-plant interactions: The pitter-patter of big feet. Some of the most striking examples of community change appear to be driven by changes in the abundance of particular species with cascading effects on other members of an ecosystem. Extensive seabird colonies com monly occur on offshore islands and can profoundly influence the distri bution and abundance of other species in coastal communities. Nesting seabirds influence terrestrial communities on islands both directly and in directly via nutrient addition and disturbance. Gulls can have particularly large effects because of their high population densities, large body size, and extremely widespread distribution. Gull breeding populations have ex panded substantially in northeastern North America, displacing other nest ing seabirds from offshore islands. The goals of this study were to quantify the direct and indirect effects of nesting gulls on terrestrial communities on islands in New England. Results from gull exclusion experiments ini tiated in 1999 indicate that trampling and nutrient input had substantial impacts on plant biomass, cover, and diversity in gull colonies. Changes in plant community structure resulting from gull activities may have im portant implications for populations of herbivores and predators occurring in gull nesting areas. ELMORE, A. J.,l J.

Semi-arid plant community response to drought and land use at the regional scale. In Owens Valley, California we have quantitatively identified the regional extent of land cover change over the last 16 years and shown that semi arid plant communities have distinct modes of response to climatic and anthropogenic stress. The 16 year data set was compared with maps of starting (1984) land cover, land use (current and historic), and soil type. Land cover changes were attributed to climate variability (an intense period of drought in the late 1980's preceded and followed by periods of sufficient rainfall) or predominant land uses (livestock grazing, irrigated agriculture, and groundwater pumping). Some meadow and shrub-meadow communi ties were largely affected by pumping and insufficient recharge and showed a greater than 50% decrease in live cover in more than 5% of the valley floor. An additional 20% of the groundwater dependent shrub and meadow communities were affected to a lesser extent by the same drivers. In many of these areas, the imposed stresses have resulted in a shift towards com munities dominated by non-native annuals, rather than native perennial grasses and shrubs. Communities which were already dominated by annuals were least likely to be affected by pumping, but showed a strong depen dence on annual rainfall. This response was observed over 10% of the valley floor. Within the limits of our observations, the remaining 65% of the valley was left largely unchanged despite low annual precipitation, primarily because these communities are either not dependent on ground water or lie in regions of the valley where there was little change in the depth to groundwater over the 16 year study period. Quantitative analyses of land cover change provide an understanding of the consequences of disturbance on semi-arid ecosystems. In this study, we have shown that intense land use can result in a shift toward communities dominated by non-native annuals. In some areas, these communities did not return to natural vegetation despite minimal land use for nearly 100 years. ELMQVIST, T. and M. WALL. Swedish Biodiversity Centre, Uppsala. The role of remnant trees in regeneration of cyclone damaged rain forest. Large remnant trees might be of significant importance for regeneration in disturbed rainforests either directly by producing large quantities of seeds or indirectly by attracting vertebrate seed dispersers. This study focused on the role of large remnant trees as for patterns of regeneration after cyclone damage in the Tafua Rain Forest Preserve, Savai'i, Western Samoa. One of two areas studied was also damaged by fire. Ten trees in each area were investigated for numbers of species of seedlings as well as densities, at different distances from the remnant trees. Three out of four species in vestigated had a higher rate of secondary dispersal in the unburned area compared to the burned area. In the latter, both numbers of species and densities of seedlings belonging to vertebrate dispersed species were sig nificantly higher under the canopies of remnant trees, compared to densities 92 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="54">at other distances. Our results are congruent with the prediction that large remnant trees surviving in severely disturbed rain forest areas serve as nuclei for regeneration. In addition to attracting vertebrate dispersers, rem nant trees might also be important in providing a favorable microhabitat for late successional species. ELSER, J.,' K. HAYAKAWA2 and J.

Nutrient limitation reduces food quality for zooplankton in nature: Responses of Daphnia growth to short-term amendment of phosphorus under field conditions. Pelagic ecologists are increasingly recognizing from laboratory studies that the quality of nutrient-limited algae is sub-optimal as food for zooplankton production. However, little is known about food quality in nature and how quality is affected by nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in the field. To test for P-limitation of zooplankton growth in the field, we performed a set of short-term P-supplementation experiments using Daphnia dentifera as an herbivore and suspended particulate matter (seston) from three lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) as food. In our 5-day growth experi ments, neonate Daphnia fed for 6-h per day on freshly collected seston enriched (+P enrichment) or unenriched (control) with P04, spending the rest of the day feeding on unaltered natural seston. Within the 6-h period, P04 enrichment did not affect food abundance but dramatically lowered seston C:P ratio. P-amendment of lake seston significantly stimulated Daphnia growth. The response of Daphnia growth was unrelated to con centrations and composition of fatty acids but instead seemed associated with seston P content. These results demonstrate that, even in field situa tions, the effects of phosphorus limitation extend beyond the algae to her bivores through reduced food quality. ENGEL, V.,' M. STEIGLITZI and M.

Regulation of watershed hydrology by plant-water relations and topographic controls. Components of a forest hydrologic cycle, including stomatal conductance, sap flow, soil moisture, vapor pressure and net radiation were measured at two elevations (lOOm difference) in a 1.5 km2 watershed dominated by Quercus spp. in the Black Rock Forest, near Cornwall, NY. A V-notch weir was used to monitor stream discharge. Close correlations were observed at 20 minute intervals between VPD, transpiration and soil moisture at the higher elevation site. Stream discharge and soil moisture at the lower ele vation site responded to transpiration rates on slightly longer time scales. Canopy processes were modeled using the SPA canopy model and a ten layer, ID soil column model. The analytic form of TOPMODEL equations were used to represent the topographic controls over surface hydrologic processes. This formulation permits for the consistent calculation of the partial contributing area and the baseflow that supports this area. Modeled stream discharge, soil moisture, and transpiration were in good agreement with observations. Results identify the importance of including topograph ically determined heterogeneity in plant-water relations when analyzing hydrologic processes at the watershed scale. ENGELHARDT, K. A. M., M. E.

Species diversity should enhance productivity whenever species use re sources in complementary ways, i.e., each species can use resources that others cannot so that total resource use by all species is greater than that of any individual species. We hypothesize that some species interactions, such as competition for space, prohibit complementarity from being ex pressed. If this is true, species richness may not always enhance produc tivity. We studied functional traits of four submersed aquatic macrophyte species to understand how these species differ in their effects on ecosystem functioning. All species significantly varied in their effects on resources (nitrogen, phosphorus, light) such that complementarity should exist among the four species. We also studied space occupation and priority effects in competition for resources and found that species significantly differed in percent space occupied and each species dominated in competition when initially most abundant. An experiment that manipulated species richness of the four submersed macrophyte species showed that species richness could not explain differences of productivity among treatments. However, when accounting for the effects of good space colonizers on productivity, species richness had a significant positive effect on productivity. We there fore propose a new hypothesis explaining the relationship between species richness and productivity. This hypothesis suggests that species richness may not always enhance ecosystem function, especially in systems where complementarity of resource use is prevented by species that are good space colonizers and that can pre-empt space.

Energetic scaling of ontogenetic growth and allocation: Testing predictions of a general allometric mod el in vascular plants. During ontogeny organisms typically show a sigmoidal pattern of growth in mass over time. Species, however, can differ in the time and size at which they attain reproductive maturity. Recently we have proposed a gen eral model that is able account for the origin of quarter-power allometric scaling in both plants and animals. In particular the model predicts meta bolic rate scaling as body mass, M, raised to the 3/4 exponent. Here we provide a theoretical extension of this model to mechanistically show how the constraints of allometry ramify to influence patterns of ontogenetic growth. Specifically, we derived a universal ontogenetic growth equation that shows how differences in allometric rates of cellular metabolism, cel lular costs of maintenance, and allocation of production influence patterns of growth. Variation in the rate of physiological processing was shown to lead to predictable differences in the rate of biomass accumulation and maximum adult size. We tested these predictions for vascular plants using long-term growth rates as measured by tree rings and permanent plot mon itoring. Observed growth trajectories were shown to be in excellent accor dance with the model. Statistical fitting of ontogenetic growth trajectories was also shown to provide an alternative measure of rates of carbon assim ilation. These results show that allometric rates of cellular processing and patterns of allocation ultimately limit the timing of reproductive maturity and biomass accumulation during ontogeny. More importantly, this work provides a mechanistic basis by which to develop a predictable framework for understanding the evolution of biological form and diversity. EPSTEIN, H.

Simulating tundra vegetation at varying lev els of aggregation: An analysis of functional groupings. Grouping organisms into categories based on common traits has been a tool of ecological scientists for some time now. Defining groups of species, examples being life forms and functional types, is an operational procedure, conducted to answer a particular question. This becomes rather practical when performing analyses at coarse spatial scales, given data limitations and the potential for species redundancy. However, the implications of ag gregating organisms for modeling purposes are still unclear. Does averaging the traits of several species into a functional group sufficiently represent the dynamics of the individual components? How much variability in the system is lost when we aggregate species into groups? In an attempt to address these questions, we examined how the level of vegetation aggre gation affected a variety of ecosystem properties using a regional-scale model of arctic tundra ecosystems (ArcVeg). We used four levels of ag gregation: species (15 dominant ones), functional groups (7), life forms (4) and vegetation type (1). All model parameters were averaged across species to determine the parameters of the aggregate vegetation. We found that the level of aggregation consistently affected community composition, total community biomass and ecosystem net primary production (NPP). In par ticular, aggregation of vegetation (i.e. reduced parameter variability) led to decreases in simulated community biomass. Aggregation of certain param eters led to either no change or an increase in ecosystem NPP. Oral Presentation Abstracts 93</page><page sequence="55">ERICKSON, J. E.,'2 J. C. VOLIN,' J. L.

Does St. Augustine grass lose more nitrogen via runoff and leaching than a lower-maintenance mixed-spe cies landscape? Leachate and runoff from residential landscapes on sandy soils may contain substantial levels of nitrogen and other applied nutrients. Therefore, a study was initiated to examine inorganic N losses in leachate and runoff between St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze) and a mixed-species landscape consisting of ground covers, shrubs, and trees. Eight plots, four replications of each treatment, were created at a 10% slope using a medium-fine sand. A granular fertilizer was applied to both land scape treatments. The turfgrass was fertilized at a rate of 300 kg N ha-' yr I and the mixed-species landscape at a rate of 150 kg N ha-' yr'. Runoff was collected and analyzed for volume, NH4-N, NO3-N. Overall, runoff volume and nutrient losses were extremely low. Measurable runoff was collected during only one intense rainfall event. No significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) in runoff loss of inorganic N between the treatments was ob served. Monthly ET was determined by subtracting the measured leachate from irrigation and precipitation. Following establishment of the mixed species landscape, no significant differences in ET were observed. Com posite daily leachate samples were collected and multiplied by the leachate volume for the respective 24-hour period to give a daily nutrient loading for each plot. Annual leachate N losses were significantly higher on the mixed-species landscape, resulting in 4.83 g N m21- yrl compared to 0.23 g N m2 -lyrl for the St. Augustine grass. These results reflect the longer establishment period required by the mixed-species landscape. ESQUE, T C.,'3 J. A. YOUNG2 and C.

Seed bank responses to experimental fires in a Mojave Desert scrub community. The invasion of alien annual grasses and wildfire into Mojave Desert scrub communities have caused concern about type conversion to alien annual grasslands. To understand the mechanisms of this change in the desert community, we quantified the effects of experimental fires on seedbanks in the Mojave Desert of northwestern Arizona. This experiment is part of a larger study designed to understand community change in response to wildfire, invasive annual grasses and granivores. Dominant perennial plants at this site are Larrea tridentata and Ambrosia dumosa. Straw was added to thirty 20 by 20 m plots to simulate the fuels necessary to create a high intensity desert fire. Peak fire temperatures in open microsites reached 350 degrees C and 851 degrees C in shrubs. However, fire temperatures were highly heterogeneous and peak temperatures usually lasted less than one minute. Seed banks were assayed by germinating the seeds from desert soils in a glasshouse. Four germination periods were conducted: Two wa tered with subsequent drying periods of one month, one watered with po tassium nitrate, and another treatment of gibberellic acid to further induce germination. Germinated seedlings were identified, counted and removed. On average germination of woody shrubs was rare in bioassays. For ex ample, Ambrosia dumosa comprised less than 2 percent of unburned sam ples, and suffered greater than 90 percent mortality. Annual grasses were the most abundant plants in unburned plots, had the greatest mortality, and still were the most abundant seeds after fires. However, the alien annual grass Bromus madritensis had 97 percent mortality due to fire and was uncommon on burned plots compared to another alien annual grass, Schis mus spp. Overall, significantly more seeds germinated from shrub micros ites than from those in open sites, and shrub microsites lost a significantly greater proportion of seeds than open sites due to fire (71 versus 65 percent loss). Species richness did not change in shrub microsites (on average 5 species before and after fires), but species richness was reduced by burning on average from 7 to 4 species per plot. We demonstrate that immediate changes occur in the demography of desert seed banks as a result of fires. ESSINGTON, T. E.,' J. F. KITCHELL' and J. R.

The spatial distributions of predators and prey are dictated by a dynamic game, the outcome of which should vary across spatial scales. We evaluated the correlation between local predator and prey abundances across a range of spatial scales, hypothesizing that predator-prey abundances would be negatively correlated at small spatial scales, but positively correlated at larger spatial scales. We assessed the spatial distribution of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and its prey (brook stickleback (Culea inconstans) and bass young-of-year (YOY)) in Long Lake, WI. We manipulated littoral habitat by translocating all structure from 20% of the littoral zone (removal zone) and placing it in a distant region of the lake (addition zone), and evaluated fish habitat use and the correlation between adult bass and prey distributions for six 24 hour periods before and after habitat manipulation. Adult bass distributions were assessed by radio-telemetry and prey distri butions were assessed by fish traps positioned along the perimeter of the lake. Bass were significantly aggregated at all spatial scales prior to ma nipulation, but were weakly aggregated after the habitat manipulation. However, this shift did not coincide with the timing of habitat manipulation, and bass preferentially inhabited the removal zone before and after manip ulation. Stickleback and bass YOY distributions were negatively correlated with adult bass across all spatial scales. Perch YOY, which were not an important prey item, were either not correlated (pre-manipulation) or were positively correlated (post-manipulation) with adult bass. Surprisingly, structurally complex habitat was not an good predictor of predator or prey abundance. We conclude that predator-prey interactions were important in dictating the spatial distribution of prey and speculate that the high prey abundance in Long Lake made it unnecessary for bass to associate in re gions of high prey density. This behavior created a refuge for prey in regions where bass did not commonly inhabit, thereby diminishing the importance of structurally complex habitat. ETTERSON, M. A.

I followed nesting success of Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) in Comanche County Oklahoma in 1998 and 1999. Nests were located using a rigorous spatial sampling scheme. In 1998 I found 48 nests. In 1999 I found 39. I used Monte Carlo simulation to test for spatial pattern in the distribution of nests. Nests were significantly aggregated in both years (P &lt; 0.05), however this appears to be a function of the distribution of nest trees (P &gt; 0.05 when nest-tree distribution is considered). This forced aggregation does not appear to affect nesting success. ETTERSON, J. R. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108 USA. Will plants be able to evolve in response to climate change? A case study from the Great Plains. Impending climate change will test the capacity of plants to evolve heat and drought tolerance. This is particularly true in highly fragmented eco systems, such as the Great Plains, where large distances between habitat patches may prevent migration of plants with the band of climate to which they are adapted. Critical factors in determining evolutionary potential are the amount and nature of genetic variation, and the magnitude and direction of selection for traits associated with fitness in warmer/drier environments. I use a quantitative genetic approach to assess the potential of an annual prairie legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, to evolve in response to in creased temperature. Specifically, I will report the results of a reciprocal transplant experiment along a latitudinal gradient in the Midwest with sites in MN, KS, and OK using pedigreed lines produced from native popula tions at each of these sites. In all sites, I found a negative linear relationship between the heritability of fecundity and the latitude of population origin. Extremely low levels of genetic variation for fecundity among the MN genotypes suggest that this population does not contain sufficient genetic variation to respond to selection as climate changes. However, there was significant genetic variation in the MN population for four other traits as sociated with fitness in warmer/drier conditions including leaf area, total plant leaf area, specific leaf area, and reproductive rate. Fecundity selection analysis indicated significant selection on these traits in all three sites. However, the direction of selection is opposite in the MN and OK sites for leaf area, specific leaf area and reproductive rate. This result corroborates previous research that demonstrated strong local adaptation along this cli mate gradient. 94 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="56">EWE, S. M. L. and L. S. L.

Schinus terebinthifolius, Raddi (Schinus), is a widely dispersed invasive exotic which has been observed growing from upland pinelands into the mangrove communities of south Florida. Schinus success could be in part due to its tolerance for a wide range of hydrologic conditions; Schinus is hypothesized to behave like native species during the wet season but be more drought-tolerant during the dry season. This study examined the sea sonal water-use patterns of Schinus compared to that of native species. In the Everglades National Park, Schinus is the dominant species in a post farmed area known as the Hole-in-the-Donut (HID); Schinus is also ob served growing in its adjacent pinelands. Water potential, stable isotope and gas exchange methods were used to examine Schinus and representa tive native species in-situ, both in the short hydroperiod HID and a rocky pineland. In both the HID and pineland sites, seasonal predawn water po tentials of Schinus remained the same although water potentials of all native species decreased during the wet season. We hypothesized that during the wet season flooded soils in both sites could have caused anaerobic condi tions which resulted in root death of native species, leading to lower water potentials. For both seasons sampled, instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher during the wet season compared to the dry season in all species due to lower transpiration rates. Schinus had consis tently higher WUE than most of the native species over both seasons. We conclude that Schinus physiological function is less affected by seasonal hydrological functions compared to that of native species at these sites. Contrary to expectations, we found that it was the wet season and not the dry, that distinguished Schinus physiologically from the native species. EWING, H. A. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA. The influence of substrate on long-term ecosystem development and its pa leoecological record. Ecosystem ecologists have characterized the flux of water and nutrients between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but they have few records lon ger than three decades. Analysis of sediment chemistry and pollen from two lakes in the upper Midwest reveals a history of terrestrial ecosystem changes and evidence for long-term differences in the flux from catch ments. The geochemical record from a lake on sandy outwash provides evidence for soil development, showing base cation leaching, acidification, and podzolization in the catchment soils. In contrast, a site 10 km away on till has a strongly developed soil, but a record only of gradual soil acidification; nearly all weathering products have remained in the soil rather than moving to the lake. This difference in the retention of water and soil weathering products, the "leakiness" of the terrestrial system, has had a strong influence on the development of soil and vegetation at the two sites. The "leaky" site on outwash has had relatively less soil development and has had incomplete forest cover for much of its history. The less "leaky" site on till has a strongly developed soil and fire-intolerant, mesic vegeta tion with a history of more complete forest cover for the last 10,500 years. At both sites, late Holocene changes in vegetation correspond to increases in weathering within the catchments, but the degree of change in soil and vegetation is not directly related. While paleoecological reconstruction of both soil and vegetation can provide a history of ecosystem development, the physical properties of the site strongly influence both the response of a site to climatic change and the record of that response preserved in lake sediments. FACELLI, J. M. and A. M. TEMBY. University of Adelaide. Adelaide, South Australia 5005 Australia. Effects of shrubs on annual plant com munities in temperate arid lands of Australia. Interactions among plants are often asymmetric and size dependent. In arid lands the presence of large perennial plants may produce spatial hetero geneity that affects the distribution and performance of annual plants. The soil under Atriplex vesicaria (one of the dominant shrub species in the system) had higher total N content than soil in open spaces, while soil under Maireana sedifolia (the other dominant shrub) had lower available P than open spaces. The germinable soil seed bank, and the annual plant community under A. vesicaria shrubs were substantially different from those in open spaces. While annual plant densities under A. vesicaria were higher than in open spaces, experimental removal of shrubs increased plant density, suggesting that the shrubs have simultaneously facilitative and competitive effects through different mechanisms. Trenching of open areas close to shrubs (to sever any lateral shrub root) decreased annual plant density, probably because water is moved laterally by shrub roots, in a process akin to hydraulic lift, increasing water availability for the annual plants. Protection against grazing had a stronger effect on annual plant biomass in open spaces than under shrubs, suggesting that shrubs provide some shelter against grazers. Our results demonstrate that shrubs have both positive and negative effects on the annual plant community. These effects are spatially-and most likely temporarily-heterogeneous, which should contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in the community. FAETH, S. H. and T. J. SULLIVAN.

Endophytic fungi are thought to interact mutualistically with their host grasses mainly by increasing resistance to herbivores, as well as by in creasing drought resistance, germination success, competitive abilities and deterring seed predators. Further, endophytic fungi have been proposed as major factors in driving plant community diversity, despite their relatively low biomass and cryptic nature. However, most of these mutualistic and biodiversity effects have been documented only for agronomic grasses, non-native herbivores, and mostly introduced plant species. There are few studies of the interaction of endophytes in native grass populations and communities. We tested several hypotheses to explain the consistently high but variable frequency of Neotyphodium infections in natural populations of Arizona fescue. We found no pattern of increased infection frequency with increased grazing as predicted by the mutualistic hypothesis. Further more, in field and greenhouse experiments, the presence of the endophyte did not decrease, and sometimes increased, preference and preformance of native and non-native invertebrate herbivores. Generally, plant genotype swamped the effects of the endophyte on both herbivore and host perfor mance. In experiments with infected and uninfected seeds where plant ge notype was strictly controlled, infected seeds had lower germination suc cess and increased seddling mortality from fungal pathogens, contrary to predictions based upon Neotyphodium as a grass mutualist. Finally, we found only a weak relationship between endophyte frequency and diversity of native plant species. Our results suggest that the purported mutualism between endophytes and host grasses, and the effects of endophytes on plant community structure, are not universal. Alternative explanations are necessary to explain the high, but variable frequency of endophytes in natural grass populations. FANG, W. SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5245 USA. Assessing the impact of the invasive tree Acer platanoides on forest communities. I evaluated the impact of Norway maple Acer platanoides (AP) on forest communities by mapping forest vegetation in a 5,000 m2 area along an invasion radient into a native mesic forest and carrying out a series of factorial field manipulative experiments. The mapping data showed that 1)AP is penetrating the native forest; and 2) AP density is negatively as sociated with diversity of native species and native seedling recruitment, and positively associated with two other exotic invasive species. Seedlings of 5 native species and 3 exotic species were transplanted under AP and its native congenitor Acer rubrum (AR). The effects of above and below ground competition and litter effects were tested by girdling canopy trees, trenching, and removing litter. Results indicated that seedlings survive and grow better under AR than under AP, and survive and grow better under girdled AP trees than ungirdled ones (p&lt;O.OOl). Four out of 5 native spe cies grew better in trenched plots than untrenched plots, but the three exotic species were not affected by trenching.

An experimental gradient of the native perennial bunchgrass Schizachyrium scoparium was created via seed addition to a newly abandoned agricultural field using a regression design. Natural invasions were allowed to proceed for six years. The experimental gradient of S. scoparium abundance de creased plant species richness from 10 species per 0.5 m2 to 3 species per .5 M2. At the peak of its growing season, S. scoparium reduced available soil nitrogen in the top 10 cm of soil from 0.461 mg/kg to 0.118 mg/kg, a reduction of almost 75%. This is consistent with resource competition as a mechanism influencing invasion success. Invader species included species that were only able to invade at low seeded densities of S. scoparium; these species may coexist via a competition-colonization trade-off. Other invader species were cold season species that were able to invade across seed den sities; these species may coexist via phenological complementarity. In ad dition, the effect of S. scoparium on available soil nitrogen was stronger at the depth of 0-10 cm than it was at 10-20 cm, suggesting the possibility of resource partitioning along this vertical gradient.

I address the hypothesis that four dominant, perennial, monocot species ranging along a life-history continuum from highly invasive (Phragmites australis) to less invasive (Typha angustifolia) to non-invasive in the east (Leersia oryzoides and Spartina alterniflora) differ consistently in their phenology, carbon assimilation and respiration, C:N ratios, water-use, and architecture, with implications for their responses to increased carbon availability. Biomass allocation, phenology, photosynthetic rates, and water use differ among the species. Specifically, efficient growth in the early season enables the more invasive species to establish and enforce early competitive superiority via shading and to attain higher total biomass than less-invasive species in both marsh types. Rising sea level accompanied by water stress may select against the more invasive species, especially Phragmites that shows lower growth rates and more negative water potentials than other species in salt marshes and relative to its performance in freshwater marshes. Season-long, comparative measurements suggest that rising C02 will alter both species composition and carbon budgets of tidal wetlands. FAUTH, J. E. University of Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA. In search of keystone predators: An experimental test of a field method. Keystone species maintain diversity in their communities. Yet despite their importance, few methods have been suggested to identify keystone pred ators in species-rich natural communities. I experimentally tested one meth od that relies on field sampling. This survey method suggested that only the mole salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum) was a keystone predator in temporary ponds of the Francis Marion National Forest, SC. Experiments in artificial ponds with five potential keystone predators showed that A. talpoideum was the strongest keystone, but two other salamanders (eastern newt: Notophthalmus viridescens, and lesser siren: Siren intermedia) also were keystone predators of larval anurans. However, keystone function was independent of initial tadpole density. These results suggest that the field method has difficulty identifying weak or functionally redundant keystone species. It also suggests that all medium-sized aquatic salamanders may be keystone predators, providing functional redundancy in natural systems. FAY, P. A., J. M. BLAIR, J. D. CARLISLE, A. K. KNAPP and M.

Initial plant pro ductivity and species composition responses to lengthened inter-rainfall intervals in a grassland: Possible consequences of altered rainfall pat terns. Climate models predict altered growing season rainfall patterns for the Central Plains grasslands. One scenario is reduced growing season rainfall quantity, repackaged into fewer, larger individual rainfall events. A ten year rainfall manipulation experiment is being conducted at Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas, to assess the implications of this scenario for tall grass prairie productivity and species composition. Rainfall quantities of 100% or 70% of ambient are being applied either at natural inter-rainfall intervals or at intervals lengthened by 50% in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Rainfall manipulations are conducted using 9 x 14-m open-sided, fixed location rainout shelters. During the first two growing seasons of experi mental rainfall manipulations, lengthened inter-rainfall intervals caused re ductions in aboveground net primary productivity, plant species richness, and cover of C4 species (primarily dominant tall grasses) that were gen erally equal or greater than reductions caused by reduced rainfall quantity. Soil CO2 fluxes also decreased in response to altered rainfall timing, which may have future implications for soil organic matter and plant-available nitrogen. These early results from a long-term experiment suggest that al tered timing of rainfall events may be an under-appreciated facet of the predicted rainfall scenarios for Central Plains grassland ecosystems.

Radial dispersion of neighbors and the small-scale competitive impact of two annual grasses on a native perennial grass. Annual grasses from the Mediterranean region of Europe now dominate many of California's grasslands possibly taking over from native perennials such as Nassella pulchra. Among other invaders, two grasses Lolium mu tiflorum (Lomu) and Bromus hordeaceus (Brho), commonly dominate por tions of the grassland and are also found together in varying proportions. We hypothesized that small-scale differences in spatial distribution and plant species composition of these alien annuals, on the order of 300 cm2 (i.e. pattern at scales &lt; 10 cm radius) could be important determinants of Nassella pulchra fitness and performance. The two grasses were planted in 20 cm diameter circular plots at a constant rate of 1 seed per cm2 surround ing a Nassella plant. The plots were divided to allow for three spatial distributions of the two annuals: No divisions (whole plots planted), one division (half planted, half empty), and two divisions (two opposing quar ters planted, two empty). Each species was planted in each distribution and they were combined as mixed, half Lomu/ half Brho, and two quarters Lomu/ two quarters Brho (nine treatments). At the center of each plot, a single Nassella plug was was planted. In January 1999, 5 replications of each treatment were established in randomized complete blocks. Outside the plots, we planted an equal mix of Lomu and Brho (1 seed per cm2) to fix the size of the gaps to the designed size. Nassella pulchra showed no effect of the species of competitor or from the distribution of the compet itors. Both interspersion of patches of open resources (bare ground) and separation of competitors into patches or their removal within 20 cm did not benefit Nassella. This implies that at small scales, Lomu and Brho compete equally as well with Nassella and that Nassella doesn't benefit from the aggregation of competitors both in terms of the species compo sition and in terms of limited amounts of unoccupied soil at the plant base. FERDY, J. and J. MOLOFSKY. University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405 USA. Allee effects can promote species coexistence in a spatial model. Many biological interactions can cause the reproductive success of an in dividual to increase with local density (Allee effect). In plants, for example, individuals might receive more pollinator visits when growing in a densely populated patch than when isolated from any other conspecific. Here we investigated the consequences of local positive density dependence on the coexistence of two species. We defined a pseudo spatial metapopulation model, where individuals experienced both competition for resources and positive density dependence within patches, and where patches were cou 96 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="58">pled through seed migration. Using moment equations, we derived differ ential equations for the density of both species as well as for the spatial variance and covariance of these densities. We found that positive density dependence allowed the maintenance of high spatial variance in density. This is because, in spite of local competition, when positive density de pendence occurs, individuals cannot efficiently reproduce unless they are aggregated. Positive density dependence also maintained strongly negative spatial covariance, such that at equilibrium the two species were spatially segregated. Increased segregation in space promoted the coexistence of these species. We therefore show that in a spatial model, the species com position of a community might not be determined only by the competitive ability of species, but also by components of their reproduction regime that can cause positive density dependence. Such components are to be expected in most animal-pollinated plants. FERNAU, R. F and N. H. WILLITS. University of California, Davis, CA 95616 USA. Rates of species accumulation of mobile organisms: An adaptive procedure for directing allocation of sampling effort. We present a new bootstrap procedure that gives an estimate of the rate of increase of species accumulation curves, and two summary statistics to provide answers to questions such as "Have I sampled enough at this site?" Because the experimental unit is the number of visits, one can answer questions like "Do I need a sixth visit, given that I have already sampled the site on five previous occasions?" One summary statistic gives the ab solute number of new species. The other, the proportional increase of new species, is an estimate of the derivative of the logarithm of the species accumulation curve. When both estimates are plotted as a function of prior visits to a sampling station, the resulting curves generally decrease (reflect ing diminishing returns), but by quantifying the expected additional infor mation to be gained through further visitation, a researcher can define a threshold beyond which additional visitation to a site is unfruitful. Two dependent variables in this analysis are absolute and percent changes in observed species, which offer the investigator some options. Which of the two is more appropriate depends on the aim of the particular visit. The final stage relates the dependent variables to landscape and ecological at tributes of the environment, so the investigator will know (for example) landscape correlates of stopping time, e.g. "do I get more out of visits at a ridge top site, relative to a valley site?" The usefulness of these rates has many other applications for ecologists, conservation biologists, and those designing monitoring projects in dynamic ecosystems. FESSENDEN, J. E. and J. R.

The isotopic composition of ecosystem respiration was measured over the course of a year in old growth and regenerating Pseudotsuga menziesiie cosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Seasonal variation in the carbon isotope ratio of ecosystem respiration appears to be correlated with changes in plant water status. Large differences in the carbon isotope ratios of respiration occurred in El Nino versus La Nina years, with the indication of higher intercellular carbon dioxide concentrations occurring within the forest dur ing the La Nina year. The carbon isotope ratios of ecosystem respiration in regenerating forests exhibited higher intercellular carbon dioxide con centrations than were observed in the old-growth forest under similar en vironmental conditions. FETCHER, N., M. CAUCCI and D. TOWNSEND. University of Scranton, Scranton, PA, U.S.A. Carbon gain in seedlings and sprouts of northern hardwood forest after deer removal. In 1994, an exclosure for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was installed in Lacawac Sanctuary in northeast Pennsylvania. At present, seed lings and sprouts of red oak (Quercus rubra) and witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) are common in the understory inside the exclosure but absent outside. Sprouts of both species are considerably taller (54 ? 9.2 cm) than seedlings (11 ? 0.9 cm) in spite of having had approximately the same amount of time to become established. In late summer of 1999, we esti mated aboveground carbon gain for 5-7 representatives of each category. Mean daily photosynthetic photon flux densities were similar for each group (1.15-1.37 mol m-2 d-') as was carbon gain per unit leaf area. There was little difference between species. Because of the greater leaf area of the sprouts, they had much higher carbon gains per plant than the seedlings (3.3 mmol C d-' vs. 0.36 mmol C d-'). If this trend continues, it appears likely that sprouts will be responsible for much of the regrowth in the exclosure. FIERER, N. G. and J. P. SCHIMEL. University of California, Santa Bar bara, CA 93106. The influence of drying-rewetting events and stress history on soil microbial processes. Soil drying and rewetting impose a significant stress on the soil microbial community. While wetting events are common, the short and long-term effects of soil rewetting on microbial processes and communities are still not well understood. Furthermore, it is not clear if stress history is impor tant to consider when modeling microbial controls on ecosystem dynamics. We manipulated the frequency of soil rewetting events over a two month period to determine how stress history influences the response of soil mi crobial communities to rewetting events. Two soils were collected from the Sedgwick Natural Reserve in Santa Ynez, CA, one from an annual grass land, the other from underneath an oak canopy. Soils were incubated in the lab and went through either 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 15 drying-rewetting cycles during a two month period, after which soils were incubated at optimal moisture for a further two months. Soil moisture content was ad justed so the average moisture over the course of the incubation was the same for all samples, compensating for the number of drying-rewetting cycles. Soils were analyzed for respiration rate, substrate utilization effi ciency, nitrification potential, microbial biomass, and NH4+/NO3- concen trations. Total CO2 loss over the course of the incubation significantly in creased with number of rewetting events for oak soils but not for grass soils, where a large number of rewetting events decreased total CO2 loss. After the drying-rewetting cycles ended, respiration rates showed some recovery in grassland soils, but not in oak soils. Nitrification potentials increased with increasing number of drying-rewetting events. One day after the final stress event, the ratio of carbon allocated to CO2 versus biomass was higher in stressed samples than the control. In all cases, the effects of the rewetting stress were greater in oak than in grass soils. The results indicate that drying-rewetting events can induce short-term and long-term changes in microbial processes and community composition, and the fre quency of such stress events must be incorporated into models of microbial dynamics.

Spatial structure and predictive mapping of chlorophyll in a large estuarine system. Analysis of surface chlorophyll (CHL) from 107 transects of the Chesa peake Bay allows two questions to be examined: 1) Does knowledge of patchiness and scaling properties improve spatially-extrapolated estimates of total surface chlorophyll? 2) Will nutrient regimes (load, frequency and residence time), spatial variability and seasonality determine patchiness and scaling? Both questions are relevant to dynamics of secondary production in the Bay. Results of spectral and autocorrelation analysis of CHL, salinity and temperature from 1996 and 1997 transects showed that estimated cor relation lengths agree with results from aerial photography. Slopes of var iance spectra for CHL and salinity were similar, resembling the theoretical -5/3 Kolmogorov slope. ANOVA of slopes showed that variability between Bay sections was more important than seasonal or yearly patterns of var iation. For predictive mapping, simple interpolation techniques did not pre serve observed scaling properties. Mapped estimates of surface CHL should display the natural variance scaling characteristics resulting from the coupling of physical and biological processes as well as the uncertain ties associated with the estimation procedures. The spectral analysis results can be used to constrain a mapping algorithm to preserve these effects. FLECKER, A. S.,' B. W. TAYLOR,' J. P. HOOD,2 B. BERNHARDT,' W. K. CORNWELL,' S. R.

Ecologists have long been interested in understanding the strengths of con sumer and resource controls in regulating community structure and func Oral Presentation Abstracts 97</page><page sequence="59">tion. Here we ask three questions concerning the relative importance of nutrients and grazers in influencing algal assemblages of a tropical Andean stream: 1) Are stream algae nutrient limited?, 2) Do top-down and bottom up controls dually influence Andean stream periphyton?, and 3) Do grazing fish modulate the degree of resource limitation? Addition of nutrients using flow-through channels and nutrient diffusing substrates revealed that algal accrual was strongly nitrogen limited, whereas phosphorus enrichment re sulted in no measurable effect on periphyton. Likewise, nutrient uptake rates were significantly higher for inorganic nitrogen compared to phos phorus. Although nitrogen enrichment stimulated algal accrual, both nutri ents and herbivores acted simultaneously on periphyton, and consumer con trol was found to be of considerably greater importance than resource con trol in influencing algal standing crop and composition. Finally, the relative degree of resource limitation varied as a consequence of grazing fish. Ex periments examining nutrient limitation in both the presence and absence of fish showed that the response to nitrogen enrichment was significantly greater on substrates accessible to natural fish assemblages compared to substrates where grazing fish were excluded. These findings suggest si multaneous and interactive effects of top-down and bottom up factors in regulating periphyton of tropical Andean streams. FLINT, S. D. and M. M. CALDWELL. Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322 USA. Plants grown in shade are sensitive to even low levels of ultraviolet-B radiation. A critical question in ultraviolet-B radiation research is how different por tions of the solar spectrum influence plant UV-B sensitivity. Field-grown plants show only subtle responses to supplemental UV-B, yet plants grown under low visible light (as in most growth chambers and greenhouses) show much more discernible changes. Plants often grow in shade of neighbors, and shade light is proportionately higher in UV-B than is open sunlight. Thus, the influence of different portions of the spectrum under shade is a potentially important issue. Since this topic has seldom been addressed with realistic light levels, we examined this in three simultaneous field experi ments using Setaria viridis, green foxtail, a weedy summer-annual grass of both open and shaded habitats. The first experiment had supplemental UV B simulating a 30% ozone depletion in full sunlight; the second had both visible light and UV-B radiation reduced to 35% of that in the first exper iment using shade cloth; and the third had the same level of visible radi ation as the second, but double the UV-B. In the first experiment, simulat ing ozone depletion under open sunlight conditions, only transitory growth inhibition was seen early in the experiment. In the two shade experiments, UV-B reduced plant height, leaf length, and stem internode elongation 10 15%, and mass by 10%, suggesting that plants in shade are more sensitive to UV-B, even if the UV-B has been reduced by the same proportion as the visible light. Surprisingly, increasing UV-B to simulate natural shade (Experiment 3) increased the magnitude of the UV-B effects by several percent only in the early part of the experiment. FORD, E. University of Washington, Seattle, WA USA. Communicating ideas in ecology-why is it difficult? When ecologists turn a critical eye on their own subject they make some serious criticisms. Foremost is that ecological concepts are inadequate that there are multiple, and sometimes conflicting, definitions of the same concept. This can lead to difficulty in communication and is a contributing cause of another criticism-that there has been a lack of progress in ecol ogy. One explanation for multiple definitions is that there is a market place for ideas. Individual ecologists invent new concepts, or redefine existing ones, to secure a place in the subject's intellectual firmament. While this social explanation may ring true at times there are important features of the subject that cause difficulty in making and holding definitions-and particularly in registering when progress has been made and a concept definition should be agreed to. In ecology we use three types of concept (Ford 2000). Natural concepts are objects we can see, count, or measure; functional concepts define properties of natural concepts, e.g., photosyn thesis of a plant. Integrative concepts use functional concepts to define organization and properties of ecological systems. Definitions of all three types change as ecological science progresses. Two things complicate pro gress and make communication difficult. (1) Functional and integrative concepts have domains of application. Inadequate understanding and defi nition of domains leads to difficulties. Domain definitions are essential components of ecological theories. (2) Not all questions can be resolved by data based investigations. Upward inference must be applied to inte grative concepts. This requires synthesis of information and defining the explanatory coherence of theories. Ecologists have not codified this part of their research. Suggestions for how to do this will be made. FORDE, S. University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA. As sessing the individual and population level effects of a disturbance us ing a dynamic state variable model. Empirically addressing the influence of a disturbance at both the individual and population level is often logistically unfeasible. Modeling provides a format in which such effects can be addressed at a number of scales, which would be intractable using experiments. I present the results of a dynamic state variable model developed to assess how the probability of a distur bance, specifically an oil spill, influences the life history trade-off between growth and reproduction in an intertidal invertebrate. I used the results of the individual model to address how the probability of oiling in a source population interacts with recruitment variation to influence the dynamics of a focal population. The model predicted that increased exposure to oil results in earlier age and/or size of reproduction and reduced lifespan. Sur prisingly, there was very little difference in individual fecundity and the total reproductive output of the population under low and high probabilities of oiling. However, when different probabilities of oiling were combined with variation in recruitment, differences between the dynamics of im pacted and non-impacted populations were considerable. This result points toward a need for further research quantifying the amount of recruitment to open populations if we are to accurately evaluate the effects of distur bances. FORDYCE, J. University of California, Davis, CA 95620. Gregarious feeding by a specialist insect herbivore increases host plant suscepti bility. Local adaptation to host plants by insect herbivores can result in physio logical mechanisms to overcome plant defenses or behavioral modifications to circumvent plant defenses. The California pipevine swallowtail, Battus philenor, lays eggs in larger clutches than observed in other populations. In California, females lay 12 to 14 eggs per clutch and larvae feed gre gariously in early instars. In other populations studied, the average clutch size ranges from two to six. Here I present evidence that a modification in this life history trait is a response to local hostplant characteristics in Cal ifornia. Increased clutch size and gregarious feeding by California pipevine swallowtails on its only available hostplant, the Dutchman's pipe (Aristo lochia californica), facilitates increased larval growth. The observed in crease in larval growth rate reduces the time larvae spend in the first instar, when they are most vulnerable to insect predators. The increase in larval growth rate is mediated by plant responses to increased herbivore loads and not the result of group feeding stimuli. These data indicate that plant responses to herbivory are important influences on the life history evolution of insect herbivores. The plant response to herbivory induced by large group feeding gregariously also deters herbivory by later emerging clutches on the same plant. This response is observed within 24 hours of initial herbivore damage. Thus, plant responses to herbivory may mediate com petitive interactions among conspecifics. FORMAN, R. T. T. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA. Spa tial models as an emerging foundation of road system ecology and a handle for transportation planning. As transportation-related environmental issues and public concern rapidly grow, a science of road system ecology stirs. Simple spatial models appear particularly promising to link ecological flows and patterns across the land scape with engineering dimensions immediately around a road. Eight useful examples gleaned from road systems worldwide, as well as from theory, are introduced: 1) Perforated roadbeds help overcome the barrier effect by enhancing the crossing of animals and water; 2) giant green network pro vides connectivity and biological diversity in intensive-agriculture land scapes; 3) shrinking populations model links habitat loss, roadkill, edge effect, disturbance, and the subdividing barrier effect of a road; 4) road 98 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="60">effect zone delineates the ecologically minimum area for transportation planning; 5) network-and-node theory combines routes and destinations, both varying in size, traditionally for transport economics; 6) road densityl mesh size links diverse effects from mammals to fire and water; 7) network variability links network form and nature's variability; and 8) ecological road fitting pinpoints the arrangement of interactions with streams, slopes, corridors, patches and species. In addition to representing a growing foun dation of theory for road system ecology, such spatial models offer visual and conceptual simplicity to stimulate collaboration among ecologists, en gineers, economists, the public and policy makers. Better road systems, which provide for safe and efficient transport and also provide effectively for ecological flows and species diversity, should emerge. FORTINO, K. and R. P CREED JR. Appalachian State University, Boone, NC 28608, USA. Does a predator transition maintain the crayfish dis tributions in the South Fork of the New River, NC? Two crayfish species (Orconectes cristavarius and Cambarus chasmodac tylus) occur sympatrically as adults in South Fork of the New River. How ever, the young-of-the-year (YOY) of the two species have a parapatric distribution. The YOY of 0. cristavarius occur primarily in the New River while the YOY of C. chasmodactylus occur almost exclusively in the trib utaries. We hypothesized that the rarity of C. chasmodactylus YOY in the New River could be explained by at least three processes; these included inability to tolerate the abiotic conditions, competitive exclusion by 0. cristavarius YOY, and selective removal by a dominant predator. The re sults of a field experiment suggest that neither interspecific competition nor abiotic factors are responsible for the rarity of C. chasmodactylus YOY. The results of a laboratory experiment suggest that C. chasmodactylus YOY are significantly more vulnerable to rock bass (Ambloplities rupestris) predation than 0. cristavarius. A subsequent laboratory experiment dem onstrated that the two species differ in their escape behaviors, which may account for the difference in predation vulnerability. Rock bass, although common the mainstem of the New River, are very rare in the tributaries, suggesting that rock bass predation may be responsible for the virtual ex clusion of C. chasmodactylus YOY from the South Fork. The anti-predator behavior of 0. cristavarius may permit its coexistence with rock bass. FOSTER, T B. I and J. R.

Being able to scale up from leaf level measurements to the ecosystem level has become an important issue in the understanding of global processes. In order to scale up, there needs to be a method for simplifying the original system. Grouping species based on their morphology is one simplification method that has been used because morphological parameters are assumed to be related to function. This study examined whether functional groups could be defined for thirteen species in the Florida scrub habitat and wheth er those groupings are related to a morphological characteristic. Since the Florida scrub is a stress-tolerating system with conservative growth strat egies, the species function should remain fixed. The objectives of this study were two fold. First we wanted to determine whether or not functional groups of species existed in Florida scrub and secondly we wanted to determine whether life forms could serve as a morphological indicator of the functional group. Functional groups were determined based on the physiological responses of the plant species; specifically carbon and nitro gen isotopes along with gas exchange. Four functional groups were found to exist in frequently burned Florida scrub. One of these groups consisted of only one species Ximenia americana , which is known to be a parasitic plant. However these functional groups did not correlate with the life form categories. FOUFOPOULOS, J.1,2 I'Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, U.S.A. 08544; 2University of Wisconsin-Madison, WI, U.S.A. Host-parasite interac tions in the Mountain Spiny Lizard Sceloporus jarrovi. Sublethal parasites are exceedingly common in nature, yet their effect on their hosts is not well understood. I examined host-parasite interactions in a natural population by experimentally manipulating parasite burdens in a free-ranging population of Mountain Spiny Lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi (Phrynosomatidae, Iguania). These lizards harbor several macroparasite species such as gastrointestinal nematodes and ectoparasitic mites, as well as microparasites such as the lizard malaria Plasmodium chiricahuae. Ma croparasite and microparasite burdens were respectively reduced by ad ministering an antihelminthic and an antimalarial compound to the hosts. Administration of the antimalarial treatment in females resulted in signifi cant mass and body size (snout-vent length) increases as compared to the control group: no such results were observed in males. Macroparasite treat ment led to significant mass and body size increases in males but not in females. Neither treatment had significant effects on host survival as in ferred from recapture rates. These sex-specific effects of parasitism were best explained by the differing energetic and physiological demands put upon males and females as the result of different reproductive schedules. Infection with Plasmodium also reduced female clutch size. Comparing infected and uninfected lizard populations using Leslie matrices indicated that infection with Plasmodium may result in a reduction of population growth rate of approximately 12%. Hence infection with malaria may have the potential to significantly reduce population growth rates for free-ranging lizards. FOX, J. W. Cook College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, U.S.A. Testing simple models of keystone predation. Most species occupy intermediate trophic levels, and share both resources and predators with many other species. Simple keystone predation models make testable predictions about how species abundances will shift along a productivity gradient. The identity of the dominant species at any produc tivity level should be predictable from species' abilities to graze down resources and sustain predators. These predictions are largely untested. I tested these models by assembling replicate protist communities in labo ratory microcosms. Without predation, prey species compete for bacterial resources and R* values predict relative success in resource competition, as predicted by the simplest mechanistic models. However, contrary to simple predictions, competing prey species coexist, grazed bacteria increase with productivity, and protist effects on bacteria do not vary with produc tivity. Bacterial heterogeneity may explain these discrepancies. A phenom enological donor-controlled model predicts the competition data better than simple explicit models of resource heterogeneity. Predation reduces total prey abundance and shifts dominance toward prey with high ratios of per capita growth rate to attack rate suffered, as predicted by keystone preda tion models. These predictions are robust to non-equilibrial dynamics. Pred ator effects on prey cascade only weakly to bacteria, consistent with donor control of prey and suggesting top-down trophic cascades are not robust to trophic level heterogeneity. Future research should focus on the mecha nisms leading to donor control. Controlled experiments are essential for distinguishing robust predictions from fragile predictions, and details that matter from details that don't. FRANKE, D. M. and A. E. WEIS. University of California - Irvine, Irvine, CA 92697. Impacts of combined leaf damage and Plasmodiophora bras sicae root infection on Brassica rapa. In this paper, we compare the individual effects of leaf damage (clipping) and of infection with the root pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae with the effect of combined leaf damage and root infection. We also compare the effects of early (3-leaf rosette stage) and late (at bolting) leaf damage to see whether the timing of defoliation altered the impact on plant fitness. We found that control plants, which were not exposed to leaf damage or the root pathogen, produced more seed and were larger than plants in all other treatments. Plants that were clipped and infected with the fungus produced less seed than plants that were only clipped or only inoculated, as was expected. Moreover, many of the plants that were both clipped and infected died without producing any seed, while death was rare for plants in any other treatments. This demonstrates that experiencing two types of damage-in this case leaf damage and root infection-can have a much more severe impact on plants than the sum of the independent impacts of those types of damage. With regard to the timing of leaf damage, we found that plants that were only clipped produced more seed when they were clipped late than when they were clipped early. However, if plants were both clipped and infected, plants that were infected and clipped early pro duced more seed than plants that were inoculated and clipped late. In this Oral Presentation Abstracts 99</page><page sequence="61">case, the presence of a second type of damage (or second natural enemy) reversed the pattern observed when only a single type of damage was considered. FRANKLIN, J. San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-4493 USA. Predicting the distribution of vegetation communities from en vironmental variables in the Mojave Desert Ecoregion. Classification trees (CTs) have been used in ecology to predict species habitat, vegetation-environment, and soil-environment relationships. CT modeling is one of several inductive approaches to learning generalized relationships between variables. It is a non-parametric, monothetic, divi sive, clustering technique for deriving classification rules that can be used predictively by applying them to new data. I used CTs to predict vegetation type (Alliance) from 16 terrain, climate and substrate variables from a sample of -1800 observations (field releves of vegetation composition) in the Mojave Desert. When the dataset was stratified into three groups, com prising four, 12 and 22 categories (Alliances) respectively, the resulting models predicted the alliance of each observation correctly 50-80% of the time (correct classification rate) using 10-11 variables. When it was al lowed that certain classes are hard to separate, given the training sample and explanatory variables (where in limited cases a correct prediction of "either A or B" was acceptable), the correct classification rate was 75-90%. However, these accuracy estimates are based on the data used to parame terize the model. Cross-validation suggested that these models are not ro bust when presented with new data. There is some theoretical basis for using a CT framework to predict species distributions, when it is expected that those distributions are delimited by thresholds of tolerance, and that the environmental variables used for modeling interact hierarchically to represent environmental gradients. However, these results suggest that al ternative model formulations may have theoretical and predictive advan tages. For example, the presence/absence of each alliance could be modeled separately using CTs, generalized linear or generalized additive models. There is considerable statistical and ecological debate about how to validate this type of model. Should all available data be used for parameter esti mation, or should new data be collected for validation? Although this sam ple was large, it appears it was not adequate for modeling rare alliances. The objective of this study is predictive mapping for regional biodiversity inventory, but scale differences between the training data and the map introduce additional challenges. FRANKS, S.

The samples were placed in a green house and scored for numbers of germinants. 1,218 seedlings were ob served by January 18, 2000. On Key Island, the vegetated areas had sig nificantly more viable seeds than the open areas (1.05 vs. 0.22 seeds per cubic centimeter soil, p&lt;0.0001 based on a Mann-Whitney rank sum test). The vegetated areas also contained more seeds than the open areas on Sapelo, but the difference was not significant (1.62 vs. 0.33 seeds per cubic centimeter soil, p=0.0637 based on a Mann-Whitney rank sum test). Spe cies diversity was higher in the vegetated than in the open areas, and both seed density and diversity tended to increase with increasing distance from the shoreline, probably due to proximity to more seed sources. The com position of the seedbank differed from the dominant standing vegetation and included many weedy species. In the vegetated plots, the seed species were often different from the adults, indicating that the adults were accu mulating dispersed seeds rather than simply having a small seed shadow. The results indicate that adult plants accumulate seeds in the coastal dune habitats studied. Perennial adult species such as Uniola paniculata and Iva imbricata may thus be necessary for the establishment of "pioneer" annual species and for the maintenance of species diversity.

A range of approaches exist for measuring competition between plant spe cies, yet these are rarely evaluated critically with respect to their perfor mance under field conditions. We contrast two approaches to detecting and measuring competition under field conditions: The first centers on plant removals, whereby the response of focal plants to the removal of compet itors is monitored, and simple indices of competitive intensity are gener ated; the second uses regressions of local rates of population change on population densities and generates per capita competition coefficients (in the sense of classic competition models). We contrast the ability of these techniques to measure competition when communities are spatially segre gated through localized dispersal, when micro- environmental heterogene ity affect species distributions and when reserves of dormant seed lead to a storage effect. Our models show that the regression method generally outperforms the removal method and has the further advantage that com munities can be monitored over long timer periods without intervention, although for short-term studies a combination of the two methods may be more powerful. The power of either technique depends, however, on the life-histories of the species being studied, and we therefore advise that techniques are explored both analytically and through simulation prior to analysis in order to generate power statistics.

Rocky intertidal community structure and dynamics vary with changes in nearshore oceanographic patterns. Two sites on the central Oregon coast show dramatically different patterns in the low intertidal zone. At Boiler Bay (BB) the low zone is dominated by macrophytes while at Strawberry Hill (SH), 80 km to the south, the low zone is dominated by invertebrates. One possible explanation for this pattern is that high nutrient availability fueled faster growth rates of algae at Boiler Bay, but field studies showed that nutrients and growth rates of macrophytes did not differ between sites. Research in southern California has shown that by interfering with the upwelling of nutrients, El Ninios can cause sharp decreases in kelp biomass through the mechanism of nutrient depletion. During the 1997/98 El Nifno, intertidal kelps appeared to be adversely affected by nutrient depletion at BB, SH and other sites along the central Oregon coast, but were seemingly unaffected at Cape Blanco, -250 km to the south of SH. The sharp contrast between the unhealthy and dying plants on the central Oregon coast and the healthy robust plants at Cape Blanco during the El Ninlo suggested that nutrients might have a much larger characteristic scale of variation and influence on macroalgae than previously considered. SST imagery revealed that upwelling persisted at Cape Blanco throughout the 97/98 El Ninlo even at its height. To initiate studies of these large-scale patterns, we quantified kelp length, density and percent cover in permanent transects at sites on the central and southern coasts of Oregon at the end of the El Ninlo (sum mer '98) and one year later (summer '99). In general, the annual kelp Postelsia palmaeformis were larger at Cape Blanco than those on the central coast and were larger in '99 than in '98. Abundance of the kelp Hedo phyllum sessile in larger (10 by 50 meter) permanently marked grids dropped sharply during the El Nifno, but had recovered in 1999. Evidence suggests that intertidal algae can be severely affected during El Nifios, but that these effects can be alleviated in coastal areas experiencing persistent upwelling. FREIDENBURG, L. K. University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269. On togeny of microhabitat use in the Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica). In New England, wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) breed in small freshwater ponds that frequently dry by early to midsummer. Their environment places a high premium on rapid growth and development of wood frog larvae; cohorts often undergo catastophic mortality when ponds dry. In order to document variation within and among ponds I evaluated patterns of micro habitat distribution, development and growth of wood frog embryos and larvae in six ponds. Wood frogs breed in large aggregations (up to 300 clutches) and larvae generally hatch and disperse from a single locale in 100 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="62">each pond. The initiation of dispersal varies in timing and larvae leaving earlier appeared to experience more rapid growth and development sub sequently. Within 10 to 14 days of hatching larvae had spread throughout even large ponds. However, larval distributions remained patchy. Prelimi nary analyses suggest that larvae may aggregate around small patches of warmer water or in the presence of ephemeral sun flecks reaching the surface through the forest canopy. FRELICH, L. E., P B. REICH, M. B. DAVIS and D. J. AUGUSTINE. University of Minnesota, St.Paul, MN 55108 USA. Alternate states and hierarchical organization of forests. To explain the cause of patchiness in vegetation has been one of the major objectives of plant ecology because more communities and species diver sity can be maintained in a given geographical area with patchy than non patchy vegetation. Temperate forests frequently exhibit patchiness caused by physiographic and soil differences of adjacent stands. We have found, however, that different forest types within the hemlock-hardwood forest region of the Upper Midwest also develop on uniform site conditions, for a variety of reasons. A hierarchical alternate state structure has slowly emerged from cumulative research efforts in forest dynamics over the last 15 years. At the highest level, there are alternate late-successional (hemlock and sugar maple-dominated) and early successional (paper birch-dominat ed) states regulated by threshold disturbance severity. Within the late-suc cessional state, there are two nested alternate states of sugar maple versus hemlock, regulated by neighborhood effect dynamics between these two species. Within the sugar maple alternate state are nested two alternate states with and without a lush understory, which is regulated by intensity of deer browsing. This nested hierarchy of alternate states does not conform to conventional hierarchies used in forest management because the size of patches does not necessarily get smaller at lower levels in the hierarchy. Instead, the magnitude of compositional differences between alternate states changes from high to low. FREY, S. D.,' J. SIX,2 E. T ELLIOTT2 and K.

Fun gal translocation as a mechanism of external nitrogen inputs to decom posing surface residues in a no-tillage agroecosystem. Additions of ('5NH4)2SO4 to the soil inorganic nitrogen (N) pool were used to measure rates of N flux from the mineral soil to surface-applied wheat straw decomposing in intact soil cores collected from a NT field. Half of the soil cores were treated with a fungicide to reduce fungal populations. Fungicide application significantly reduced fungal biomass, decomposition rates, and net N immobilization of surface residues. Net N immobilization over the study period was estimated to be 1.5 and 0.9 ,,g m-2 for untreated and fungicide-treated residues, respectively. The rate of '5N transfer aver aged 13.4 ,g g-1 residue d-I for untreated wheat straw. Fungal inhibition reduced 15N flux by 59-78%, reductions of similar magnitude to those observed for fungal biomass. Nitrogen transfer in sterilized soil cores ac counted for 7.8 % of the total upward N transport in control cores, indi cating that abiotic processes did not contribute substantially to N flux. We estimate a total annual fungal-mediated N flux of 2.4 g m-2, which is nearly equivalent to the N immobilization potential predicted, based on initial N and lignin content, for the wheat straw used in this study. We conclude that fungal N translocation is a significant exogenous N input and can account for the net N immobilized by surface residues decomposing in the field. Both residue quality and N availability appear to be important con trols on fungal biomass associated with surface residues and rates of soil to-residue N translocation. FRIEDENBERG, N. A. Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA. The evolution of dispersal in populations and communities: A direct test. There is now broad acceptance of the landscape mosaic view of nature in which communities exist as patches connected by dispersal. Much attention has been focused on the effect of increased disturbance regimes or habitat fragmentation on the size and longevity of metapopulations and the results of these studies can be scaled up to metacommunities, as well. Field studies demonstrate that environmental instability is positively correlated with the prevalence of vagile organisms within both populations and communities. However, the difficulty of quantifying or manipulating dispersal and habitat quality in the field prevents a direct test of the hypothesis that habitat instability selects for individuals with high dispersal propensity. I use two mutant strains of the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in controlled microcosm experiments to directly test for the causal link between random habitat fluctuations and dispersal propensity. C. elegans is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite and does not hybridize during short-term experiments. Each strain is therefore the analogue of a species and each microcosm a com munity. One strain has higher fecundity, while the other strain has a higher propensity to disperse between patches of food on agar plates. I show that the strain with higher fecundity increases in frequency in stable habitats, whereas the strain with higher dispersal propensity increases in frequency in treatments with random patch extinction. The results of these experi ments indicate that there is a causal link between habitat stability and the prevalence of vagile species. These results can also be applied to models of evolution within populations. FRITZ, R. S. and C. G. HOCHWENDER. Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA. Resistance of F2 and backcross willow hybrids to her bivores. Resistance of F2 and backcross hybrids between Salix sericea and S. eri ocephala were compared to pure parents and to F, hybrids. Five replicate crosses of parental and hybrid plants were made from pure parents. Plants were grown in pots in a common garden adjacent to naturally occurring willows. Leaf number and the numbers of gall-inducing, leaf-mining, leaf tying and free-feeding herbivores were counted on the shoots of each plant to determine density. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and a priori con trasts. Contrary to the prediction that F2 hybrids would have a higher break down in resistance than F, plants, we found four cases where F2 plants were more resistant than F, plants. This suggested that recombination led to the breakup of host recognition traits in F2 hybrids. Two cases showed the expected breakdown of resistance in F2 plants. Comparing backcross plants to their parents, we found mostly additive inheritance of resistance or no difference among the taxa. In several cases, we found dominance of resistance or greater resistance in the backcrosses. This latter result also suggests the breakup of genes used for host recognition by these herbivores. For most herbivores, the inheritance of resistance in backcrosses differed depending on the direction of the backcross. These data indicate that hy bridization may produce plants that are more resistant than their parents, contrary to the prediction that hybrids should be more susceptible. FROST, P. C.,' J. J.

Effects of benthic grazers on epilithon C:P stoichiometry in boreal lakes. Epilithon (particulate organic matter attached to rock surfaces) elemental composition has recently been shown to be highly variable in boreal lakes. However, causes of epilithon C:P variation remains poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that variable epilithon C:P ratios are caused by benthic grazers who may remove a different combination of elements than they return. This hypothesis was tested at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada where we exposed epilithon in small enclo sures (700 cm2) to different grazing intensities by caddisfly larvae for 20 days. We sampled enclosures after 10 and 20 days to see how grazers affected the carbon and phosphorus content of epilithon. Caddisfly grazing strongly reduced epilithon total C (p&lt;0.001, day 20) and P (p&lt;0.05, day 20) and by doing so, altered epilithon C:P ratios (p&lt;O.O5, day 20) com pared to no/low grazer treatments. Our results show that ungrazed epilithon accumulates C but not P in these extremely P-poor lakes. Grazers alter epilithon C:P ratios by removing C faster than P, perhaps by removing large quantities of non-living organic matter characteristic of these benthic biofilms. These results suggest grazers have the capacity to affect multiple aspects of epilithon, especially its elemental make-up. By doing so, benthic grazers may alter aspects of algal and detrital decomposition and the effi ciency with which primary production moves into higher trophic levels.

Hysteresis during recovery fol lowing a whole-lake acidification experiment: Biology lags substantially behind chemistry. Acidity in many ecosystems throughout North America and Europe has been decreasing as rates of sulfate emissions and deposition have declined. We present evidence here, however, that recovery by a zooplankton com munity lagged substantially behind chemical recovery following a whole lake acidification experiment. The treatment basin of Little Rock Lake in northern Wisconsin, USA was acidified from its original pH of 6.1 in three, 2-year stages to 5.6, 5.2, and 4.7. It has been allowed to recover without intervention since the end of 1990. By 1996, the annual average surface pH value in the Treatment Basin was more than 6 and was fairly close to the Reference Basin pH of 6.2. In contrast, a similarity index comparing the zooplankton communities in the Treatment and Reference basin re mained below 0.4 in 1996, substantially less than the values of more than 0.7 that occurred throughout most of the experiment's baseline year in 1984. This lack of similarity occurred despite the presence of the same zooplankton species in both basins. Our results suggest that recovery by biological communities can be delayed for at least several years after pH recovery in acidified systems. FRY, J. D.I and M.

Ethanol can reach toxic levels in breeding sites of wild Drosophila melan ogaster, and there is widespread genetic variation for ethanol tolerance within and among populations. An hypothesis for the maintenance of this variation is that ethanol-tolerant genotypes are selected against in the ab sence of ethanol. To investigate this possibility, we compared two popu lations selected for ethanol tolerance (E populations) with two control pop ulations (S populations) in survival and development rate in the presence and absence of ethanol. Because ethanol tolerance in larvae can be induced by exposing eggs to ethanol, eggs were pretreated by soaking for 15 hours in solutions either containing (18%) or lacking ethanol. On ethanol food, egg-to-adult survival and development rate of eggs not pretreated with ethanol were higher in the E populations than in the S populations. Pre treating eggs with ethanol dramatically increased the survival of eggs from all populations on ethanol food, with the magnitude of this induction re sponse being greatest in the E populations. On standard food, survival and development rate of eggs not treated with ethanol did not differ among the populations, giving no evidence that adaptation to ethanol resulted in lower fitness in its absence. However, the mechanisms responsible for ethanol tolerance are not fully activated unless eggs are exposed to ethanol, sug gesting that ethanol-tolerant genotypes may largely avoid the potential fit ness costs of expressing those mechanisms when they are not needed. FUJIWARA, M.',2 and H. CASWELL.1 'Woods Hole Oceanographic In stitution, Woods Hole, MA 02543; 2Massachusetts Institute of Technolo gy,. Causes of declining trend in the survival rate of the North Atlantic right whale. The North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) is the most endan gered large whale species in the world. The current population size is about 300, and declining. Causes of the decline are still unknown; however, en tanglement with fishing gear, collision with ships, and changes in food availability due to climatic change are suspected. To evaluate these hy potheses, we introduced environmental factors as covariates in a mark recapture analysis of survival from sighting of 370 whale from 1980 through 1997. We used data on lobster pot and sink gillnet landings in the North Eastern US, number of ships entering major ports in five regions along the east coast of the US, North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and principal components derived from these variables. The Akaike weight method was used to rank the importance of each covariate in explaining the survival trend. Our results show that ship traffic in the mid-south region, NAO, and lobster landings are ranked higher than other covariates, and that the three covariates are not strongly correlated. A combination of these three covariates explained the trend in the survival best. It will require careful analysis to determine the true cause of the decline, but with our current knowledge, none of the three major types of threat to the population (fishing gear, ship collision, and climatic change) can be excluded as potential causes of the increased mortality of the North Atlantic right whale.

Di urnal patterns of isoprene emission and the potential role of substrate regulation. Isoprene emission from plants is one of the principal ways in which plant processes alter atmospheric chemistry. Diurnal variations in isoprene emis sion from plants under ambient conditions are often attributed to daily patterns of light intensity and leaf temperature. However, diurnal variations in emission that are independent of light and temperature also occur but have not been examined in as much detail. These light- and temperature independent diel variations may provide biological insight into the regu lation of isoprene emission. We measured diurnal patterns of photosynthe sis and isoprene emission at constant light and temperature from nursery and field grown eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and red oak (Quer cus rubra) individuals using gas exchange techniques and gas chromatog raphy. Significant increases in isoprene emission were observed throughout the day in all nursery and field cottonwood, with daily increase rates rang ing from 20 to 160%. In contrast, diurnal trends were absent or very small in oaks. Differences in diurnal patterns of carbon accumulation and export between P. deltoides and Q. rubra could have accounted for contrasting diurnal emission patterns, suggesting that substrate availability may influ ence emission capacity. To explore the potential mechanism of substrate regulation of isoprene emission, P. deltoides saplings were shaded for 24 hours to prevent carbon accumulation within the leaf resulting from pho tosynthesis. Shaded individuals displayed significant diurnal increases in emission, although rates were significantly lower than in non-shaded con trols. The presence of diurnal emission patterns in the absence of photo synthate accumulation suggests that substrate alone does not determine emission capacity. We conclude that both substrate availability and enzy matic activity may regulate isoprene emission capacity. FUSSMANN, G. F,' S. ELLNER2 and N. G. HAIRSTON JR.'

Populations in the field are not usually at equilibrium. It has been a long standing question whether intrinsic factors are likely to cause the fluctua tions observed in natural communities. Our premise is that a combined empirical and theoretical approach to understanding simple laboratory com munities should provide a valuable foundation for understanding organisms in the wild. Our experimental system consisted of single-stage chemostats culturing rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) and their algal prey (Chlorella vulgaris), with variable supply rate of the nutrient limiting algal growth (nitrogen). By altering the flow-through rate of the chemostat we estab lished three principal dynamical states of the system: extinction of the predator, coexistence at an equilibrium, and predator-prey oscillations. More specifically, gradually increasing the flow-through rate transferred the system from a stable equilibrium to periodic oscillations, consistent with the occurrence of a Hopf bifurcation. A similar, but reverse bifurcation back to stable equilibrium occurred at very high flow-through rates. A realistic theoretical model can reproduce the bifurcation structure of this simple system. We conclude that mechanistic processes underlie the dy namics of simple multi-species communities. GALLANT, A. L. USGS EROS Data Center, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 USA. New land cover dataset for supporting regional and national scale landscape analyses in the conterminous U.S. A new land cover classification for the conterminous U.S. has been pro duced by the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center.

The classification contains 21 cover types and reflects condi tions centered on 1992. Although several classification approaches were explored during the project, we found that data pre-processing procedures had the greatest effect on the quality of the results. Thus, we are currently developing methods to improve scene selection, reduce data distortion dur ing image mosaicking, and partition the data into mapping zones that de crease within-dataset spectral and ecological variance. An accuracy assess ment of the classification has, to date, been completed for the eastern half of the country, and associated analyses are being used to determine the type and spatial distribution of classification errors made in different parts of the country in order to focus future efforts on overcoming these clas sification challenges. Additionally, we are aiming for a more flexible da tabase structure for upcoming land cover products by using the current data to explore the feasibility of mapping continuous land cover variables and discrete variables that cross-reference land cover types with land uses. These changes in the database will allow users to partition or aggregate land cover characteristics to best suit specific applications. GALLO, K. and W A. WURTSBAUGH.

Ecologists have spent considerable effort studying consumer excretion and related effects on nutrient recycling; however, transfer of nutrients by con sumers has received less attention. Fish may move nutrients from the lit toral zone of a lake to the pelagic zone through their feeding and excretion activities, thereby providing nutrients for phytoplankton that were previ ously unavailable. We present a pond study using stable isotopes to ex amine fish-mediated nutrient transfer. The pond was divided into 8 parallel lanes, each of which received one of two treatments: fish (brook trout) present or absent. '5N-labelled periphyton grown on tiles was placed in the littoral zone of each lane. Movement Of 'sN was traced through the pond food web, comparing the fish and fishless lanes. Nutrient concentration and biomass of phytoplankton, periphyton, zooplankton, and benthic inverte brates were also quantified. A 15N values in phytoplankton and periphyton (new growth during the experiment) were significantly higher in the lanes with fish, indicating transport of nutrients from periphyton in the littoral zone. However, total nitrogen in the water column was not increased by the presence of fish. Although fish diet consisted of 90 % littoral prey, and fish excreted/egested over 30 % of N consumed, fish contributed only 1.2 % of TN in the water column. Fish did not have significant effects on phytoplankton or zooplankton biomass, however fish did significantly re duce benthic invertebrate biomass and increase periphyton biomass. We conclude that although fish did transfer significant quantities of N, transport was not as important as other sources of N in the pond. Availability of N from the littoral zone was apparently not important for phytoplankton, since biomass was not increased in the presence of fish. GALUSKY, P. and J. R. OTT.

The host vigor hypothesis (HVH) predicts that phytophagous insects pref erentially feed on relatively vigorous plants (or vigorous shoots within a plant). We tested the HVH by comparing the observed within-canopy dis tribution of galls induced by Belonocnema treatae (Cynipidae: Hymenop tera) with the distribution predicted by the pattern of carbon uptake of the host plant. Quercus fusiformis exhibits differential rates of carbon uptake within its canopy by both strata (upper &gt; mid &gt; lower) and compass direction (SE &gt; SW = NE &gt; NW). The within-plant distribution and performance of two consecutive gall-former generations were sampled for the 3 strata and 4 compass directions on 16 trees. At each of the 12 strata x direction sites/tree, ovipuncture density, initiated gall density, gall size, and gall-former performance (# mature galls/ovipuncture) were estimated from a random sample of 100 leaves (total 1200 leaves per tree). Three way ANOVA was used to test for main and interaction effects of direction, strata, and host plant on ovipuncture density, initiated gall density, gall size, and performance. Gall and ovipuncture density were highest in the low stratum; and conversely, performance was highest in the upper stratum. These results suggest that larval performance is enhanced on relatively vigorous regions within host canopies; but contrary to HVH predictions, preferred oviposition sites at this scale are not correlated with performance. The contradiction may be an artifact of spatially constrained gall-former attack strategies. GARDENER, M. C., M. P. GILLMAN and J. SILVERTOWN. The Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. The effects of soil nitrogen on amino acid composition of floral nectar. Plants of the meadow annual Agrostemma githago (Carophyllaceae) were grown in one metre square field plots prepared with three fertilizer treat ments as follows: a) 'low', no fertilizer, b) 'medium', 25 g of slow release fertilizer granules, and c) 'high', 75 g of granular treatment. After sowing in spring the plants were left until flowering in late summer. Nectar was extracted by using glass microcapillary tubes. The material was frozen and sampled at a later date. The samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the AccQtag (Waters Corp.) system. Analysis showed that the total concentration of amino acids increased sig nificantly with increasing soil nitrogen treatment (p&lt;0.05). Of the amino acids present glutamine showed a large and significant increase (p&lt;0.02) whilst the others showed no significant trend. Due to the large increase in glutamine the relative abundance of each amino acid in the nectar was altered. Glutamine showed a significant increase (p&lt;O.O1) in percentage of the total with most of the remaining amino acids declining in relative abun dance. The results show that, in contradiction to earlier work, that envi ronmental conditions can affect the amino acid complement of nectar. This may have implications for plant-insect interactions as local populations of pollinators may benefit in a variety of ways and visit plants preferentially. GARDINER, E. P,I J. L. MEYER,I W. 0.

Sediment modeling and fish assemblages in the upper Little Ten nessee River basin: Assessing the legacy. Sediment is a common pollutant with long-term impacts on streams of the southeastern United States. We implemented the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to estimate erosion in the Upper Little Tennessee River watershed (1153 sq. km) in Macon County, North Carolina during three years for which imagery was available: 1950, 1970, and 1992. We simu lated sediment transport and delivery to stream channels to derive predicted total sediment loads on each date to all streams in the study area for each year. The model demonstrated that sediment loads to streams were gener ally lower in 1992 than in either of the two previous years. We used the simulated sediment load data to predict the total abundance of (1) all fish, (2) sediment-intolerant, and (3) sediment-tolerant taxa present in 48 streams sampled between 1992 and 1996. We predicted that all fish and sediment intolerant fish would be negatively correlated with simulated sediment load summed across all three years as well as for 1992 alone. We predicted no relationship between sediment load and the total abundance of sediment tolerant taxa. The latter prediction was true for all regression models ana lyzed. The first set of hypotheses was also supported. There appeared to be a response above a sediment load threshold, so we examined the twelve sites with the highest loads in 1992. Predicted sediment load for 1992 explained over 80% of the variation in the abundance of sediment-intol erant taxa. The sum of predicted loadings for all three years explained 78% of the variation in intolerant abundance and 52% of the variation in all taxa. We have demonstrated the importance and utility of distributed sed iment modeling for exploring explicit linkages between land cover and fish assemblage structure. This approach is particularly important when using historical fish collections for which ancillary data, such as geomorpholog ical measurements, are not available. GARRETT, K. A., G. A. FORBES,2 A.

Inference from the spatial pat tern of disease: Evidence for spore showers of Phytophthora infestans in the highland tropics. Suppose we observe a population of plants in which each plant has ap proximately the same low level of infection by an airborne pathogen. Sup Oral Presentation Abstracts 103</page><page sequence="65">pose we also know that there were few pathogen propagules originating from 'within' the area of this particular host population. The combination of few local pathogen propagules and low infection levels evenly distrib uted may indicate an epidemic initiated by a large number of propagules from 'outside' the area of the host population. If that is a reasonable con clusion, then field surveys of the spatial pattern of a particular disease may be useful for gathering information about how epidemics of that disease begin. But how safe is it to assume that a uniform pattern of disease implies a large number of initial propagules? To consider this question, we designed a simulation model of the dispersal of pathogen propagules through a field of host individuals. The model includes as parameters the number of prop agules that initiate an epidemic, the size of the population of host individ uals, the shape of the propagule dispersal gradient around an infection, and the number of pathogen generations. Propagules are distributed randomly through the host population to initiate an epidemic and in the next gener ation new propagules are dispersed with the probability of infection of any given host individual determined by the parameters of the dispersal gra dient. A range of parameter values was considered in a series of simula tions, with particular emphasis on parameter values appropriate for the pathogen Phytophthora infestans. After the designated number of pathogen generations, the level of spatial aggregation of disease was measured for each simulation run. Though it was possible to generate a uniform pattern of low disease levels from a small number of initial propagules, this was an unlikely result for the parameters of P. infestans under the assumptions of our model. This is of interest because the spatial pattern of infection by P. infestans in Ecuador and Peru has been observed to be uniform at low levels, in contrast to the aggregated disease observed in temperate regions. Disease management practices that depend only on reducing P. infestans spore production within a field may be less useful in the highland tropics because of spore showers. GAVRILETS, S.

This framework can be used to approach a number of questions such as species-area distribution, species-range size distribution, the rate of ecological turnover, asymmetries of range division between sister species, waiting time until speciation and extinction, the relationship between the geographic range size and the probability of spe ciation, the relationships between subpopulation-level parameters and me tapopulation-level parameters, and the effects of taxonomic level on these rates, distributions and parameters. I used numerical simulations and ana lytical approximations to study the dependence of the number of different taxonomic units, S, their average range size, R, and the rate of their turn over, T, on the system size, n, the rate of fixation of genetic (or morpho logical) changes in local demes, [i, and the rate of local extinction and colonization, d. For one-dimensional systems, S=( p/2 d K/[L)(/2), R n (2/ p A/(d K)(1"2), and T = ,./K, where K is the minimal number of genetic (or morphological) differences required to assign two subpopulations to dif ferent taxonomic groups at a given taxonomic level (e.g., subspecies, spe cies, genera, families etc.).

Growth responses to mycorrhizal colonization of rainforest seedlings vary with light intensity and plant species. Both light intensity and root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi are consid ered important factors affecting the performance of rainforest plants, yet few studies have examined how these two factors interact. I determined whether mycorrhizal colonization altered growth or biomass allocation in four Australian rain forest seedling species (Flindersia brayleana, Acmena resa, Cryptocarya mackinnoniana and Cryptocarya angulata) grown in a glasshouse under light conditions that mimicked the shaded understory (3% PAR) and small light gaps (10% PAR). Seedlings were grown in sterilized field soil and were either inoculated with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi or provided sterile inoculum. Three major findings emerged. First, variation in light intensity had similar effects on seedling dry mass and biomass allocation in all species; increased light intensity resulted in greater seedling biomass, greater root length and a lower leaf area ratio. Second, in all species, mycorrhizal colonization was significantly lower at 3% PAR than at 10% PAR. However, the magnitude of this difference varied among species, ranging from 25-82%. Third, growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation varied with light intensity and plant species. Mycorrhizal col onization promoted growth in both light regimes in only one species, F. brayleana, while it had no effect on either growth or biomass allocation in C. angulata in either light regime. Responses of the two other species were intermediate-mycorrhizal colonization promoted growth only in high light in A. resa, while it increased the leaf area ratio and decreased the root length of C. mackinnoniana in both light regimes. The finding that my corrhizal growth responses were observed in only one of four species in shaded understory light conditions, and in only two of four species in small gap light conditions, suggests that some rain forest seedling species may not benefit from mycorrhizal colonization, at least in terms of growth, in the low light environments characteristic of rain forest habitats.

Invasive non-native species, livestock overgrazing, and fire suppression have been blamed for the changes in structure of semi-desert grasslands in the southwestern United States. Specifically, these factors are thought to have reduced native species diversity and hindered restoration and conser vation efforts. Management targeted at restoration of native vegetation and reduction of non-native populations has included removal of cattle and reintroduction of frequent prescribed fires. The Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR) was established in southeastern Arizona in 1985 to provide habitat for the recovery of the masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi), a federal endangered species. Much of BANWR is dominated by Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees (Lehmann love grass), an undesirable introduced grass from South Africa. We analyzed data collected as part of a long-term vegetation monitoring survey in 1987, 1989, 1993, and 1997 on 38 permanent transects at BANWR using re peated-measures analysis of variance, and determined that basal cover of native species and non-native species have not changed substantially in ten years. We assessed the influence of fire regime on basal cover of native species and non-native species in 1993 and 1997; neither fire frequency nor time since fire affected cover or species composition. However, average cover of E. lehmanniana increased in 1993 on soils with low clay content, likely in response to above-average annual rainfall. This study suggests that climatic and edaphic factors may outweigh management efforts. GENTRY, G. and L. DYER. Mesa State College, Grand Junction, Colorado 81502 USA. A multi-taxa assessment of the effectiveness of caterpillar defenses against parastioids A caterpillar often has several types of defense at its disposal and may use them all to escape predators or parasitoids. Many previous studies deter mined if a defense works against a particular enemy, but which defenses are most effective against which type of enemy has not been examined closely. We assessed the efficacy of different caterpillar defenses against parasitoids using a statistical approach that considers defenses across mul tiple taxa. Determining the relative importance of different defenses against enemies will further our understanding of the evolution of these defenses, and the role of enemies in determining insect herbivore diet breadths. Third to fifth instar caterpillars from 55 species in 17 families were collected in the field during the wet and dry seasons in 1994 -1999, scored for various behavioral and morphological defenses, then reared in the laboratory. De fenses were used as predictor variables in log linear models with parasitism as the response variable. This analysis allowed us to separate the relative effectiveness of each type of defense. Overall parasitism for all caterpillars was 24.75%. Levels of parasitism in the dry season were always higher than in the wet season. The most important predictors of parasitism, in order of importance, were behavior, then season, then morphology. Cater pillars that dropped off the plant were the least likely to be parasitized, whereas caterpillars that did nothing were the most likely. Thrashing was a good protective behavior, but biting and vomiting were not. Spiny and hairy caterpillars were parasitized more often than glabrous ones. Cater 104 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="66">pillar coloration was not important. The results suggest that parasitoids had difficulty physically placing eggs or larvae on or into caterpillars with defenses involving movement (dropping/thrashing), or re-encountering lar vae that had moved. Fixed morphological defenses (hairs), venom delivery (some spines), or warning/cryptic coloration may be more oriented to de fense against insect or vertebrate predators than to parasitoids.

Importance of plant form and microsite to the avoid ance of low-temperature photoinhibition in different life stages of co nifers in the alpine treeline. Relationships between plant form, microsite frost and high sunlight expo sure, and photosynthesis were evaluated in current-year germinants, seed lings (ca. 5th year), and adult trees of Englemann spruce (Picea engleman nii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) in the Snowy Range of Wyoming, USA. The ratio of sunlit to total leaf area (STAR) was highest in germi nants (0.25 for P. englemannii, 0.33 for A. lasiocarpa), about 40% lower in seedlings than germinants, and &gt; 75% lower in adults than germinants for both species (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.05). These data indicated much greater structural optimization of sunlight and temperature for older plants. The occurrence of individuals in microsites with high sky exposure, where frost and sunlight exposure is greatest, was considerably lower for seedlings than for adults or germinants. Seasonal depressions in the ratio of maximal to variable fluoresence (Fv/Fm), as a result of low-temperatures and high sun light exposure, were greatest in cotyledons of germinants (from ca. 0.81 to 0.19 for P. englemannii and 0.07 for A. lasiocarpa), at least 35% lower in primary needles of seedlings, and at least 60% lower in adult needles (AN OVA, P &lt; 0.01). Smaller depressions in FJ/Fm for older plants indicated less low-temperature photoinhibition (LTP) than in the germinants. The absence of avoidance strategies for LTP in germinants may contribute to their high mortality. In contrast, reduced STAR in adults, and reduced STAR and microsite selection in seedlings may be important for avoiding LTP. GIARDINA, C. P, I M. G. RYAN,2 D. BINKLEY3 and J. H. FOWNES.'

Effects of fertilization on patterns of carbon allocation and gross primary production in a tropical plantation forest. Nutrient inputs to forests have increased over the last 50 years, and these inputs are likely to alter ecosystem C budgets. The positive effects of in creased soil nutrient supply on aboveground net primary production (ANPP) are well documented, but the effects of nutrient supply on gross primary production (GPP) and patterns of C allocation remain poorly char acterized. Some evidence indicates that nutrient-related increases in ANPP are matched by decreases in total belowground C allocation (TBCA), with little change in GPP Other evidence indicates that GPP increases with increased nutrient supply, and a greater proportion of this increase is al located to ANPP than to TBCA. In this study, we examined 12 closed canopy stands of Eucalyptus saligna for changes in ANPP, TBCA, and GPP following quarterly additions of 50 kg N, 25 kg P, and 25 kg K ha-' to half these stands. Prior to fertilization, ANPP, TBCA, and GPP did not differ among stands. After 1 year of fertilization, GPP was 28% greater in fertilized stands than in unfertilized controls (4.3 and 3.3 kg C m-2 yr-', respectively); after 2 years, GPP had increased by 48% (5.1 and 3.4 kg C m-2 yr-', respectively). The additional GPP was allocated primarily to ANPP, which increased by 75% in year 1 and 88% in year 2. TBCA did not change with fertilization. These results suggest that relatively small additions of limiting nutrients can dramatically increase GPP and alter C allocation patterns in forests. GILL, R. A., J. LORETI and R. B. JACKSON. Duke University, Durham, NC 27708. Global patterns of root turnover evaluated for vegetation, climatic, and physiological variables. Root turnover is a critical component of ecosystem nutrient dynamics and carbon sequestration, and is an important sink for plant primary productiv ity. We tested global patterns of root turnover for plant functional groups and across climatic gradients using a database of 150 published studies. The slowest average turnover rates were observed for entire tree root sys tems (10% annually), followed by 34% for shrubland total roots, 53% for grassland fine roots, 55% for wetland fine roots, and 56% for forest fine roots. Root turnover decreased from tropical to high-latitude systems for all plant functional groups. We also found that root turnover was highest for tree fine roots of very small diameter and decreased with increasing root diameter increment. Root turnover rates increased exponentially with mean annual temperature for fine roots of grasslands and forests and for total root biomass in shrublands. Surprisingly, after accounting for tem perature, there was no such global relationship between precipitation and root turnover. We used a database of published studies to evaluate root respiration as a potential factor influencing root turnover with increasing temperature and root diameter. We found that root respiration increases with decreasing root diameter in trees and is positively correlated with temper ature, potentially supporting the hypothesis that root longevity is controlled by within-plant carbon economy. The variability in data included in our study also indicate that refining methods of estimating root turnover and understanding site-specific characteristics will be important for fully un derstanding controls over root turnover.

Recent evidence suggests that soils of some central Appalachian hardwood forests have become nitrogen (N) saturated, a condition that develops when availability of soil N exceeds demand for N by plant roots and soil mi crobes. Among many environmental concerns associated with N saturation are the following: (1) greatly altered N cycle seen as a de-coupling of N dynamics from the high degree of biotic control that occurs in N-limited forest ecosystems and (2) greatly enhanced nitrification and leaching of nitrate along with calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) from the soil and into streams, depleting base cation availability in the soil. Both of these have been demonstrated for hardwood forests of the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF), West Virginia. Because increases in rates of nitrification and loss of soil cations often are associated with forest harvesting, it is impor tant to determine whether the simultaneous effects of N saturation and harvesting may accelerate ecosystem degradation. Accordingly, we estab lished a plot-based study to examine the effects of harvesting with and without addition of N and cations on soil N dynamics at FEE Our treat ments (each with four replicate 0.2-ha plots) were as follows: (1) Control (no treatment), (2) Harvest only (whole-tree harvesting [WTH] of entire plot), (3) Harvest+N (WTH plus 36 kg N/ha/yr), and (4) Har vest+N+cations (WTH plus 36 kg N/ha/yr plus 22.4 and 11.9 kg/ha/yr each of Ca and Mg, respectively). The cation addition treatment was done to simulate a mitigative treatment to replace loss of base cations to leaching. As expected at this N-saturated site, even our control plots exhibited high rates of N mineralization, mostly as net nitrification. However, these high rates were increased significantly by all harvest treatments in the first post treatment year; addition of N in combination with harvesting did not in crease nitrification significantly over harvesting alone. However, addition of cations in combination with harvesting and N resulted in nitrification rates significantly higher than the other harvest treatments. Effects of har vesting appeared transient, generally disappearing by the third post-treat ment year. These results illustrate the complexities and challenges facing management of hardwood forests in the context of pollutant conditions.

Hydrologic response to reduced vegetative cover and soil removal in a sagebrush steppe community. Erosion is a serious problem throughout the world and has been linked to stream sedimentation, ecosystem degradation and loss of rangeland pro ductivity. Measurements of soil surface hydrology provide a quantitative measure of soil erosion potential. Soil surface hydrology is directly and indirectly influenced by vegetative cover and soil loss. Thresholds of soil loss have been promulgated by the Natural Resource Conservation Service as a guide for ecosystem sustainability. However, knowledge of soil loss effects on rangeland productivity or ecosystem sustainability is lacking. Before thresholds can be determined, researchers must clarify the relation ships between vegetative cover, soil loss and soil surface hydrology. The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of vegetative cover removal and soil removal on soil surface hydrology (e.g., infiltration, surface runoff and sediment production) in a sagebrush steppe (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystem under simulated rainfall. Infiltration, sediment pro duction, surface runoff, surface roughness and other factors were measured and evaluated for their response to three levels of vegetative cover removal (0, 30% and 60%) and soil removal (0, 11.2 and 22.4 tonnes ha-i). Prelim inary results indicate that the maximum treatments resulted in a 13% re duction in the equilibrium runoff rate and a 30% reduction in the time to runoff. GLAUBER, A. J. and R. J. NAIMAN.

Substantial research in temperate forests has demonstrated the importance of headwater riparian forests and streams in regulating downstream nutrient fluxes, but few data exist for tropical riparian systems. Our objective was to evaluate potential variations in aboveground litterfall and particulate nu trient inputs to riparian forests and headwaters streams along a landslide induced successional gradient in the upper Rio Pachitea Basin, a Peruvian Amazonian tributary. We hypothesized that streams adjacent to mature ri parian Amazonian montane forests experience temporally more stable in puts of litter and litter-associated nutrients than streams in disturbed forests. Litterfall from three sites (5-years post-landslide, 10-years post-landslide, and mature "Sites 5Y, IOY, and M, respectively ) was collected bimonthly to determine mass inputs of total litterfall and its' fractions (plant families, twigs, reproductive structures, unidentified, epiphytes, and frass). Given strong gradients for soil, vegetation and nutrients along landslide scars, data from upper and lower portions of scars were evaluated separately. Nutrient concentrations were determined for each site's largest fractions. We present one year of data suggesting total nutrient inputs, along with component fractions, vary predictably across an ecosystem development gradient. Litterfall input rates were lower on landslide sites than in mature forest, and were the most different between upper and lower zones of the youngest landslide. Mean annual litterfall inputs (? s.d.) collected over 1998/1999 were 265.42 ? 154.37 [Lg/m2 and 412.90 ? 226.47 [Lg/m2 at Site 5Y's upper and lower zones, 330.70 ? 115.87 Rg/m2 aind 277.24 ? 49.19 p.g/m2 at Site IOY, and 666.97 ? 225.35 p,g/m2 at Site M. Addi tionally, nutrient concentrations were found to vary between fractions. While this study focuses on alterations in particulate allochthonous inputs following landslides, a natural disturbance, the findings are likely to suggest mechanisms by which ecosystems recover following similar anthropogenic disturbances.

Population biology of native and alien thistles: Relative importance of competition and herbivory as a function of soil fertility. While it is generally recognized that plant populations are structured both by competition for resources and by the effect of herbivores, we still have a limited understanding of when one factor is more important than the other. This study examined the population biology of two species of thistle which have been shown to be strongly limited both by competition with background vegetation and by insect herbivory. For each of the two thistle species I assessed the relative importance of competition and herbivory under conditions of low productivity and enhanced productivity by con ducting a full factorial manipulation of site fertility (NPK fertilizer added vs. unfertilized), competition (plots clipped to remove background vege tation vs. unclipped) and herbivory (caged and sprayed vs. not). I measured treatment effects on the demography of cohorts of plants emerging from seeds I added (% germination, % survival, % reproduction) and on a per plant basis (plant size, # herbivores/plant, seed production/plant). Both ab solute responses and indices of response were calculated by normalizing for the response in unmanipulated plots. Both species responded similarly, and absolute responses and normalized responses displayed very similar patterns overall. Study plants responded very strongly to NPK addition in the absence of competition and herbivory. Intensity of competition and of herbivory both increased with fertilization. Overall, impact of competition was highly predictable. The impact of herbivores was more variable, among plants within a treatment, among treatments, among plant species, and among guilds of herbivores. While the impact of herbivores increased with fertilization, the impact of competition increased even more, suggesting that herbivory may generally be more important relative to competition at less productive sites and competition more important at productive sites.

Near shore ecological properties associated with shoreline erosion processes in selected Great Lakes ecosystems. Unprecedented development of Great Lakes shorelines has altered the phys ical properties that drive coastal recession and erosion along many shore line reaches. Changes in sediment supply and erosion rates along shorelines influence the aquatic-terrestrial interface that mediates resource availability in nearshore areas. Altered physical processes modify habitat and nutrient availability, influencing local aquatic community structure. Understanding the responses of shoreline and nearshore ecosystems to development pres sure and altered physical processes can contribute greatly to restoration efforts and improve resource planning strategies. Our multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team has combined efforts to model erosion processes, habitat availability and aquatic community structure based on surveys of shorelines and nearshore areas along the eastern and western shores of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie. Preliminary data analyses suggest that nearshore habitat and aquatic community patterns are associ ated with shoreline erosion processes. Nearshore areas characterized by sandy, organic rich sands and sediments support abundant benthos and are heavily utilized by juvenile fish. In contrast, nearshore areas where down cutting associated with altered shoreline physical processes has removed much of the organic rich sand substrates are characterized by altered, sim plified community structures. Additionally, exposure of cobble substrates and hard-packed clays have provided ideal habitat for invasive species such as zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, and round gobies, Neogobius melanostomus, thus enhancing changes in nearshore aquatic communities along altered shorelines.

Talking ramets: Induction of defense against herbivory in ramets by attack on connected ramets in the clonal plant Fragaria chiloensis In many plants, herbivory induces responses, including chemical defenses, that deter further herbivory. We hypothesized that clonal plants can transmit signals for the induction of chemical defenses against herbivores through connections between ramets and defend unattacked ramets against likely future herbivory. No test for such signal transmission between ramets of clonal plants appears to have been published before. Infection of ramets of Fragaria chiloensis (beach strawberry) with Tetranychus urticae (two-spot ted spider mite) increased phenol concentration in connected, unattacked ramets. When these ramets were subsequently infested with mites, mite population growth was slower than on ramets connected to another unat tacked ramet. These results strongly support the hypothesis that herbivory 106 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="68">on one ramet of a clonal plant can induce chemical defense against her bivory in connected ramets. We conclude that ramets can "talk". Induced response in unattacked ramets appeared to be advantageous to the plant since it decreased herbivore performance. However, we could not show that clonal integration of induced defense also increased plant growth. Ex periments in which total herbivore burden per clone is held constant are now testing this further. GONZALEZ-MELER, M. A., E. NAUMBURG, D. ELLSWORTH, J. N. SIEDOW and W. H. SCHLESINGER. Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA. Can trees grown in the shade benefit from low respiration rates at elevated CO2? Tree leaf respiration is inhibited by 18% as a consequence of growth at elevated CO2. Most of the inhibition is due to the so-called direct effect, in which the rate of respiration is rapidly and reversibly reduced following an increase in CO2 concentration. Shade-tolerant trees usually exhibit lower dark respiration rates than shade-intolerant ones. Low respiration rates in the shade are helpful because they lower the light compensation point for photosynthesis enhancing the plant carbon balance. Reduction in rates of dark respiration by elevated CO2 in shade-grown plants will contribute to enhance the plant carbon balance by lowering the light compensation point, particularly in shade-intolerant species where respiration rates are maximal. However, if elevated CO2 inhibits the respiratory production of ATP, vital processes such as carbohydrate transport, might be limited and growth sub sequently affected, particularly in the shade tolerant species where respi ration is minimal. We studied leaf respiratory responses of two shade tolerant and two shade-intolerant species to elevated CO2 in a Duke pine forest understory under free air CO2 enrichment. We measured respiration by the oxygen isotope fractionation technique to accurately estimate net respiratory ATP yields of leaves. Direct effects of a 200-ppm increase in CO2 concentration over ambient levels, reduced leaf-level respiration, par ticularly in the shade-tolerant species irrespective of the CO2 levels at which plants were grown. CO2 did not affect dark respiration in all species when rates were measured and compared at the respective growth CO2 concentration, suggesting the existence of compensatory physiological changes at the leaf level. Despite changes in respiration, elevated CO2 did not affect respiratory ATP yields in the shade tolerant species Cornus flor ida. However, ATP yields were significantly reduced at elevated CO2 in the shade intolerant species Liriodendron tulipifera, with negative impacts on growth. GONZALEZ-MONTAGUT, R.

Mexico has established an initial system to monitor and evaluate the impact on conservation and sustainable use of natural protected areas in a program that includes ten priority reserves. At the program level, the monitoring and evaluation system allows to keep decision-makers informed on pro gress and needs of the program. At the reserve level, this system provides continuous feedback to reserve managers to allow for adaptive manage ment. At the program level four indicators measure impact of conservation and sustainable use activities: Reduction or maintenance of natural habitat conversion rates, maintenance of the frequency of observation of indicator species, maintenance or increase in the number of people involved in con servation and sustainable use activities, and maintenance or increase in the proportion of area under sustainable use over the surface area under de structive land use. The baseline data (1980 to 1996) indicated that rates of natural habitat conversion in the ten reserves range between 0 and 1.45% per year. Each reserve selected between five and ten indicator species and established the frequency of observation per species per year. A total of 38,434 people were reported to be involved in conservation and sustainable use activities in the ten reserves, and 834,717 ha were registered as being transformed from destructive to sustainable land use practices.

Microbial biomass and soil fauna: Comparisons be tween tropical and subalpine forests. Soil fauna can influence soil processes through interactions with the mi crobial community. Due to the complexity of the functional roles of fauna and their effects on microbes, little consensus has been reached on the extent to which soil fauna can regulate microbial activities. We quantified soil microbial biomass and maximum growth rates in control and fauna excluded treatments in dry and wet tropical forests and north- and south facing subalpine forests to test whether soil fauna exhibit different effects on microbes under diverse climatic conditions. Exclusion of fauna was established by physically removing the soil macrofauna and applying naph thalene. The effect of this naphthalene application on the biomass of mi crobes that mineralize salycilate was quantified using the substrate induced growth response (SIGR) method. We found that: (1) The exclusion of soil fauna resulted in a higher total microbial biomass and lower maximum growth rate in the subalpine forests, (2) soil fauna exclusion did not affect the microbial biomass and growth rate in the tropical forests, and (3) the microbial biomass of salycilate mineralizers was significantly enhanced in the fauna-exclusion treatment in the tropical wet and the south-facing sub alpine forests. We conclude that non-target effects of naphthalene on the microbial community alone cannot explain the large differences in total microbial biomass found between control and fauna-excluded treatments in the subalpine forests. Soil fauna have relatively larger effects on the mi crobial activities in the subalpine forests than in tropical dry and wet for ests. GOODALE, C. L. and M. . Carnegie Institution of Washington, Stanford, CA 94305 USA. Carbon uptake in forests of Eurasia and North Amer ica. Modeled estimates of global sinks and sources of carbon disagree over the magnitude of terrestrial carbon uptake in the northern hemisphere. Forest inventories throughout Europe, Asia, and North America provide extensive, detailed measurements of key components of terrestrial C budgets, includ ing: forest stocks, growth, mortality, and harvests. Yet forest inventory data do not directly quantify all forest C pools (e.g., woody debris or soils), and different assumptions regarding conversion factors or the behavior of un measured pools has led to large discrepancies in estimated net forest C uptake. Previous estimates have made varying assumptions regarding these terms, or have excluded them altogether. We have adopted a common framework for interpreting inventory growth data, for quantifying the fate of harvested materials, and for estimating C fluxes to and from dead wood and soil pools. The estimates integrate databases specific to Canada, China, Europe, Russia, and the United States, with adjustments to make the data from each region as comparable as possible.This effort is the first step in a project to reconcile model-based and inventory-based approaches to un derstanding carbon sinks in the terrestrial biosphere.

The ecological impact of successful invaders by introduced species de pends, in part, on characteristics of the invader and its interaction with the invaded community. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine patterns and test ecological predictions of invader impacts based on characteristics of the particular invader and of the invasion pattern. We quantitatively syn thesized results from 90 field studies that provided 618 different measures of impact of plant, insect, fish, or marine invertebrate invaders. We divided response variables into impacts at the individual, population, community or ecosystem levels, expressed as the response ratio (lnRR). Invader taxon, trophic level, taxonomic relationship, and type of interaction between in vader and response species all affected patterns of impact. At the popula tion level, effects of insect and marine invertebrate invaders exceeded those Oral Presentation Abstracts 107</page><page sequence="69">of fish or plants, but we found no differences in effects at other levels. For insects (population impacts) and fish (community impacts), omnivores con sistently had larger effects than predators or herbivores. For fish (population level) and insects (community level), indirect invader effects exceeded competitive effects; predation effects were intermediate. The impacts of plant invaders did not differ significantly between competitors and invaders that altered habitat quality. Competitive impacts of invading insects were higher for response species related at the family level or closer, but this pattern did not hold for other taxa. Invasion scale and pathway also affected impacts. Contiguous range extensions showed lower impacts than disjunct invasions at the population level for all taxa together and for fish. For all taxa together, accidental introductions had significantly higher impacts than intentional introductions at the population, community and individual level. Insects intentionally introduced for biocontrol had lower population level effects (on non-target organisms) than accidentally introduced insects. We developed a randomization procedure to correct for the effect of non-in dependence among effects measured within a single study. Using this tech nique, fewer comparisons showed significant heterogeneity. GOODWIN, B. J. I and L.

Using an individual based, spatially explicit simulation model we investigated the response of six potential metrics of connectivity (mean transition probability, mean vis its per individual, and mean immigration rates at both the patch and cell scales) to varying landscape structure (amount of habitat, number of habitat patches, size distribution of habitat patches, edge to area ratio of habitat, mean distance between habitat patches, variance of distance between hab itat patches). The six metrics of connectivity were remarkably different in terms of the aspects of landscape structure they responded to (e.g., the mean transition probability for patches was primarily driven by habitat spacing while the mean number of new patches visited was primarily driven by the number of habitat patches). Furthermore, the relationships between the measures of connectivity were complex and dependent upon the state of the landscape. These results suggest that some metrics of landscape connectivity will respond to some aspects of landscape structure while oth er metrics will respond to other aspects of landscape structure. This will complicate both the applications of the concept of connectivity and com parisons between studies using different connectivity metrics. GORDON, D. R.,1,3 L. PROVENCHER,2 A. R. LITT,2 G. W.

Comparing restoration methods using similarity metrics in Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Experimentally evaluating the success of restoration techniques against a reference condition is not directly possible because reference sites are not randomized or replicated, and therefore are not within the experimental design. We addressed this issue in fire-suppressed longleaf pine, Pinus pal ustris, sandhill communities using a large-scale experimental block design. The experiment involved comparing the effectiveness of three hardwood removal techniques (fire, herbicide, and mechanical) for restoration of un derstory and habitat components from 1994 and 1999. We measured soil, vegetation, and animal variables in restoration treatment and reference sites. Similarity of variables in restored plots to those in the reference sites was evaluated using proportional similarity and endpoint difference, a similarity metric we developed that is based on the t-statistic. The two similarity metrics will be illustrated using data from the sandhill plots. These metrics can be used to distinguish among species or variables that dominate sim ilarity indices and less common species that strongly associate with certain conditions, such as high fire frequencies.

Arctic Field Ecology: A model for integrating teaching, research, and Inuit ecological knowl edge. Many scientists realize the value of 1) integrating research and education and 2) incorporating indigenous knowledge about ecosystems in research programs. There is also value in integrating both indigenous ecological knowledge and research in educational programs. Arctic Field Ecology is a University of Minnesota course that takes place in Nunavut, Canada that is developing new ways to teach students ecology by integrating western research practices and Inuit ecological knowledge. The key to the success of developing a course integrating students, scientists, and Inuit is in rec ognizing their common ground: An appreciation of the land or Nuna (in Inuinnaqtun). We find that a course can be developed in which students 1) gain complementary insight into ecological interactions from both western and Inuit instructors; 2) gain an appreciation of current land use and land management issues; 3) gain an understanding of research licensing and control by indigenous landowners; 4) think critically of the differences between western scientific methods (developing testable hypotheses) and indigenous ways of knowing (repeated observation and experience, oral history, close connection and dependency on land and wildlife); and 5) gain experience in ongoing research projects. Inuit instructors receive eco nomic benefits, teaching experience, contacts with current arctic research ers, and a forum for educating and influencing tomorrow's arctic research ers. GRAM, W.

Effects of landscape-level disturbance on amphibian and reptile communities in Missouri Ozark forests. Disturbance created by timber harvest results in a fragmented landscape where patches of regenerating forest are surrounded by sapling or mature forest. We experimentally tested the short-term impacts of removing several large patches (even-aged management) or many small patches (uneven aged management) of mature forest on amphibian and reptile abundance and species composition. We did not find treatment effects on species com position or community-wide abundance one year or two years after timber harvest. However, Ambystoma salamanders declined in uneven-aged treat ment sites on SW slopes and increased on uneven-aged treatment sites on NE slopes relative to control sites two years after harvest. Toads on NE slopes declined less in even-aged treatment sites and more in uneven-aged treatment sites than in control sites one year after harvest. On SW slopes, toads declined less in both even-aged and uneven-aged treatment sites than control sites both one and two years after harvest. Small snakes on NE slopes declined more in both even-aged and uneven-aged treatment sites than control sites two years after harvest. In general, Plethodon salaman ders increased on all sites after harvest treatment, whereas skinks showed little change after treatment implentation. These results suggest that, from a landscape-level perspective, disturbance of several large patches is less detrimental to most amphibian and reptile groups than disturbance of many small patches because even-aged timber harvest may affect less of the surrounding forest than uneven-aged management.

Experiments to teach ecology (Volume 2): A new ESA-sponsored web site and CD-ROM for undergraduate ecological education. For more than a decade many ecological educators within ESA have ded icated their efforts to increasing the quality and availability of undergrad uate laboratory activities to teach ecology. In 1993, the ESA published a collection of peer reviewed, field-tested, and commonly formatted Exper iments to Teach Ecology (Volume 1) edited by Jane Beiswenger, and hun dreds of copies of Volume 1 sell each year. In response to this demand, we have new NSF support to create a CD-ROM and ESA-linked website. We are currently compiling and editing a Volume 2 of additional experi ments. Each new lab activity (1) follows a common inquiry-based template with downloadable *.PDF files for lab handouts, data sheets, assignments, 108 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="70">and student assessments, (2) includes keyword lists on "Ecological Con tent," "Science Methods Skills," and "Pedagogy" which are hot-linked to ESA-linked resources (and/or on the CD-ROM), (3) includes links to an interactive HELP board to discuss questions, suggestions, etc., about the content, methods, assessment, evaluation, and other aspects of the lab (to help others with implementation challenges across a variety of educational scales), (4) includes an interactive repository of student-collected data, analyses, and comments (and we note that comparisons of data among geographic locations, seasons, years, etc., could themselves become activ ities), and (5) includes links to specific methodologies, analytical designs, and other resources for faculty to download and use that would enable and encourage faculty to engage in rigorous formative and summative evalua tion of their use of each activity. Currently we have more than six new labs in the editorial pipeline all of which are undergoing field testing and peer review prior to an anticipated December 2000 publication date. The Experiments Volume 2, is actually nested within our larger NSF funded project "Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology (TIEE)," which will include web and CD-ROM resources to teach current issues in ecology (global warming, coral reef loss, exotic species, etc.) and a digital library of pedagogical resources. We are presently seeking faculty to field test and review submitted experiments as well as submissions to its companion Issues to Teach Ecology. GRAY, D. W.,I M. T LERDAUI and A. H.

Seasonal pattern and influence of water stress on pho tosynthesis and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol emission from ponderosa pine. Ecophysiological controls, phenological patterns and the influence of water stress on emission of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) were studied in a pon derosa pine plantation in the central Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Photosynthesis and MBO emission rates were made using gas exchange techniques and gas chromatography; light, temperature, and C02-response curves were generated for both processes. Monthly measurements (June October) of photosynthesis and MBO emission were made on all available needle age classes at both a site experiencing a natural summer drying cycle and a well watered site. MBO emission increased logarithmically with light exactly paralleling the light response of photosynthesis. MBO emission increased exponentially with temperature while photosynthesis declined. MBO emission increased in response to C02, reaching a maxi mum at 350 ppm and declining slightly at higher values. Needles began emitting MBO within 2 weeks of the start of needle expansion. Emission of MBO under constant conditions (basal emission rate) declined with nee dle age. Under constant conditions MBO emission did not vary over the course of the day, but showed a pronounced pattern over the course of the season. The seasonal pattern of basal MBO emission was correlated with seasonal changes in ambient temperature, but was not correlated with sea sonal trends in photosynthetic capacity. An identical response of basal MBO emission rate to ambient temperature was seen at both the drought stressed and well-watered site. We conclude that MBO emission is regu lated independently of photosynthesis and postulate that ambient temper ature regulates the capacity of a needle to produce MBO. GREVSTAD, F Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA. Time lags in plant invasions in heterogeneous habitats. A common observation in exotic plant invasions is a long delay between the time of first introduction and the time when the population becomes noticeably invasive. These time lags can be surprisingly long &lt; up to hundreds of years and the transition between latent and invasive phases is often abrupt. Explanations tend to enlist changes in habitat, climate, or genetic make-up the population. However, I present a simpler explanation for time lags of this magnitude in invasions occurring in heterogeneous habitats. Using a stochastic simulation in the form of an interacting particle system, I show how the chance configuration of habitat in the vicinity of the introduction can often stall the progress of an invasion. Invasions may be stalled even further if the population has either an Allee effect or seed dormancy. The implication is that many "non-invasive" introduced plants may be time bombs for future invasions. The model can also be used to identify human-assisted disturbance events that have the potential to trigger a population to switch from a latent to invasive phase. GRIFFIN, P. C.' and T. J.

The endangered southwestern arroyo toad, Bufo californicus, is now limited to 22 watersheds in southern California. We set out to identify habitats that are preferred by adult arroyo toads for burrowing and surface activity. We examined the land cover type preferences of arroyo toads at a coarse scale, based on comparisons of minimum convex polygons [MCP] of area used by each animal to available habitats in the study site, using compositional analysis. The land cover types were agricultural, campground, channel, terrace, and upland. We also examined the microhabitat preferences of ar royo toads for different substrate, vegetation, and vegetation structure types relative to the amounts of those habitat types available within their MCP Substrate types were clay, silt, fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, gravel, and cobble. Vegetation types were willow and mulefat, sycamore, oak, coastal sage, chapparal, non-native grasses, large exotic plants, low annual plants, agriculture, debris pile, and no vegetation. We designated vegetation structure types according to total canopy coverage and canopy height dis tribution. We attached radio transmitters to arroyo toads using an external belt attachment system and tracked 83 arroyo toads over an average period of 30.9 days (S.D.= 29.0) in 1998. Female arroyo toads (n= 15) signifi cantly preferred terrace and channel habitats over campground, agricultural, or upland habitats. During the breeding season, male arroyo toad preference for channel habitats was greater than all other habitat types, probably be cause channel habitats were closest to breeding sites. Sands of all size classes were the preferred substrates for arroyo toad burrowing. Dense, canopied vegetation structures were the least preferred sites for arroyo toad burrows during this study.

Coastal sandplain heathlands are disturbance-dependent communities that occur in the northeastern United States. It is hypothesized that salt spray plays a role in maintaining heathland communities as dwarf shrublands. We investigated the effects of salt spray in heathlands on Martha's Vine yard, Massachusetts, with the following goals: (1) to determine spatial pat terns of salt spray accumulation in heathlands and (2) to identify a mech anism by which salt spray might maintain these plant communities. We found that salt spray accumulation rate decreased in heathlands as distance from the ocean increased, while the height of heathland plant species in creased as distance from the ocean increased. Based on results from ma nipulative experiments, we propose that this change in plant height could be attributed to the effects of salt spray. We subjected plants to three levels of salt spray treatment: none, moderate (equivalent to salt spray accumu lation during normal conditions at 25 meters from the ocean), and high (equivalent to salt spray accumulation during hurricane conditions at 25 meters from the ocean). Using these treatments, we found that xylem pres sure potential (-MPa) became more negative in heathland plant species as salt spray levels were increased. We also found decreased shoot growth, decreased leaf production, and increased leaf necrosis with increased salt spray levels. The effects of salt spray on heathland plant physiology may provide a mechanism by which this abiotic factor maintains heathland plant communities. GROSS, L. J.' and D. L. DEANGELIS.2 'University of Tennessee, Knox ville, TN, U.S.A.; 2University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, U.S.A. Some lessons from the ATLSS project: modeling and Everglades restoration. For much of the last decade, the ATLSS (Across Trophic Level System Simulation) project has been developing and applying a set of models de signed to aid in restoration planning for South Florida. These make up a multimodel, consisting of a collection of submodels which utilize different mathematical and computational approaches in order to account for trophic components which operate at differing levels of spatial, temporal and biotic complexity. Developed in close collaboration with many field researchers with long experience in the Everglades, ATLSS has been extensively ap plied throughout the planning process and used in the evaluation of the Oral Presentation Abstracts 109</page><page sequence="71">biotic impacts of alternative hydrologic scenarios. We expect the process used for the development of ATLSS to be useful in similar efforts for regional environmental assessment. Developing succinct summaries of complex spatial model outputs in order to allow rapid analysis by field researchers of alternatives was essential. This led to the development of a relative assessment protocol in which all ATLSS outputs were compared to a base plan. Project managers could use this to develop a ranking of various alternative plans utilizing their own preferences for spatial regions to be considered. A uniform methodology across species and functional groups also allowed managers to apply their own criteria when accounting for differences in species responses between scenarios. The relative as sessment approach has additional advantages in that the dependence of the rankings obtained on model assumptions can be explicitly tested. Though considerably more complex than aggregated spatial averages, spatially-ex plicit models evaluated through a relative assessment protocol provide de tails of trophic component responses that are essential for systems with explicit spatial controls. GROVER, J. P. University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019 USA. Stoichiometry, herbivory, and competition for nutrients. When plant species compete for two nutrients and are grazed by herbivores, the relative sequestration of the two nutrients by the herbivores-their "stoichiometry"-is expected to influence competitive outcomes. This ef fect arises from differential recycling of the two nutrients by herbivores, and it is explored with simple Lotka-Volterra models, and with more re alistic parameterized models. Variations in herbivore stoichiometry poten tially produce the same range of competitive outcomes as arise from abiotic variations in relative nutrient supply. In some cases, predicted patterns of plant species dominance resemble the "resource-ratio" patterns seen in competition models without herbivores. Patterns of dominance and re sponses to enrichment also resemble other recent models of simultaneous plant competition and herbivory. Parameterized models of algae and zoo plankton suggest that such stoichiometric effects occur under realistic con ditions, and that planktonic herbivores are unlikely to mediate coexistence of competitors.

Modeling autotrophic respiration for the DUKE forest: What the CO2-induced alterations implicate. At the Duke forest canopy-level responses to elevated CO2 (E) were studied in an intact pine (Pinus taeda) plantation exposed to 200 ppm above am bient levels (A) using a free-air CO2 enrichment technique. A model for the autotrophic respiration in the Duke forest was developed. The model separates respiration (R) into maintenance (RM) and growth respiration (RG). Biomass related data was available from the Duke forest (allometric relationships, nitrogen concentrations, leaf area, fine root mass + turnover). Parameterization of the respiration itself was done pine-specific, using pub lished temperature and nitrogen/sapwood-volume functions for RM and tis sue construction cost for RG, respectively. Since long-term respiration equals GPP minus NPP, model evaluation was performed by comparison with modeled GPP subtracted by measured NPP after some modification. In 1997, 900 (A) and 1326 gC m-2 yr' (E) were available for the autotrophic respiration, suggesting a 51% increase due to CO2. Model results fitted into this range only when high N-concentrations of fine roots were applied exclusively to the class with diameter less than 1mm and when a sapwood volume function instead of a nitrogen function was applied for modeling the bole respiration. In that case, model results amounted to 1009/1050 gC m-2 yr' for A/E treatments. None of the processes implemented so far in the respiration model allows respiration to increase to the extent that was predicted by R implied by GPP-NPP. These results have three possible implications: The C02-induced GPP increase was overestimated and/or a carbohydrate sink in the Duke forest is missing and/or the autotrophic respiration model needs to be revised to have a stronger influence of car bohydrate status.

Studies on mixed-grass prairie have found that native large herbivores pref erentially graze on prairie dog towns. We investigated use of prairie dog towns by cattle in Colorado by conducting surveys of cattle and vegetation on the Shortgrass Steppe LTER Site from June-August, 1999. Twelve pastures containing 15 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns were surveyed three times a week, and the number of cattle on the towns and their behavior was recorded. Three pastures were intensively surveyed twice weekly wherein the habitat and activity of a randomly cho sen focal animal was recorded every six minutes for 3-4 hours. Bite and step counts of other individuals were recorded for five-minute intervals. Vegetation height and cover data were collected monthly. Vegetation on prairie dog towns was significantly (P&lt;0.05) shorter on (mean = 4.6cm), than that off (mean = 11.3cm) prairie dog towns. Cattle randomly used the prairie dog towns observed on driving surveys. Towns occupied an average of 3% of the pastures, and cattle were present on them an average of 3.5% of the time. This was not significantly different from expected (P=0.64). The intensively surveyed pastures yielded similar results: i.e., cattle did not significantly prefer or avoid the prairie dog towns. This re search indicates that cattle do not prefer to graze on prairie dog towns on the shortgrass steppe as bison (Bison bison) do on the mixed-grass prairie. HAAS, H., K. ROSE and R. SHAW. Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA USA. The effect of marsh edge on early life stage abun dances of brown shrimp: Implications of an individual-based simula tion model. We created a spatially explicit individual-based model to simulate brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) production in coastal wetlands. The model begins with the arrival of postlarval shrimp in the estuary and simulates growth, movement, and mortality on two tidal cycles per day until individuals em igrate to the ocean at about 60 mm length. Marshscapes are modeled with a grid of habitat-specific 1 m x 1 m cells created from a land/water clas sification of aerial photographs. When shrimp are in vegetated cells, their individual daily growth is faster and their mortality is lower. We used the model to test the hypothesis that shrimp production increases with increas ing edge. We applied the model to two marshscapes with similar land/water ratios but different amounts of edge habitat (i.e., many small patches versus a few large patches). Simulation results indicate that the relationship be tween shrimp production and edge is complex due to the nonlinear effects of the spatial arrangement of habitat on shrimp survival and growth. Pre dicted survival varied up to two-fold between the marshscapes with dif ferent landscape patterns. Our results emphasize the importance of under standing the non-linear effects of habitat fragmentation in estuarine nursery areas. HACKE, U. G.,' J. S. SPERRY,' S. D. DAVIS2 and W. T.

An important aspect of drought adaptation in plants is the ability to avoid cavitation, i.e. to keep xylem conduits water-filled under negative xylem pressures. Based on the correspondence between air permeability and cav itation pressure, cavitation is thought to occur by air seeding into xylem conduits. We tested the assumption that denser secondary xylem would be more resistant to air seeding and cavitation by a survey of over 70 diverse woody species. Wood types included conifers, diffuse-porous trees, ring porous trees, Chaparral shrubs, and shrubs of the Great Basin and Sonoran deserts. In most wood types, there was a highly significant relationship between increasing wood density and increasingly negative xylem pressure causing 50% embolism (P,0). To investigate whether there was a direct mechanistic link between density and P50 we developed a model based on a theoretical relationship between air seeding pressure, wall porosity, wall density, and wood density. The model predicted a curvilinear relationship between P50 and wood density that fit measured P50 values with an r2 of 0.70. According to the analysis, the differences between wood types in the density vs. P50 relationship were the result of different ratios of wall volume to total wood volume (wall fraction), which in turn were related to xylem conduit anatomy. For example, conifers achieved more negative P50 at a given wood density than angiosperms because of the lower wall fraction associated with a xylem composed overwhelmingly of tracheids. The anal ysis suggests that an important cost of building low-pressure resistant xy lem is the construction of dense wood. In a given wood type, this cost is 110 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="72">steepest in the less negative (more vulnerable) P50 range, and is less im portant as more negative P50's are achieved. Thus, fast growing woody plants, and plants adapted to favorable water supply, would be expected to show the smallest margins of safety from cavitation. HACKER, S. D.,' C. HELLQUIST2 and M. N.

Patterns of plant species abundance and physical conditions in salt marshes and mud flats invaded by the non-native cordgrass, Spartina anglica, in Puget Sound, WA, USA. The non-native, invasive cordgrass, Spartina anglica, was introduced into northern Puget Sound, Washington, salt marshes and mud flats in 1961. Despite its prolific spread for close to four decades, little is known about the pattern of invasion of Spartina anglica in these native communities. We were interested in discovering the relationship between Spartina abun dance and measures of plant species number and abundance, soil physical conditions and intertidal height at a number of invaded sites within Puget Sound. At salt marsh sites, we found Spartina restricted to the lowest in tertidal zones where it captures sediment and extends the low marsh out into former mud flat habitat. In this new intertidal zone, plant species num ber and abundance is low (3-5 species), especially compared to the existing high intertidal (12-15 species), but a monoculture was not observed. At mudflat habitats, we found Spartina restricted to high intertidal sites where it created a raised marsh habitat and facilitated the establishment of a num ber of previously absent plant species. To understand the effect of Spartina on soil conditions, soil water content, redox potential and salinity were measured in areas with Spartina and those with intentional removal. We found lower water content, lower redox potential and higher salinity in soils without Spartina. Spartina, because of the unique role it plays in Pacific Northwest estuaries, has had major community level effects. HADDAD, N.,' D. TILMAN,2 J. HAARSTAD,2 M. RITCHIE3 and J.

Contrasting effects of plant diversity and composition on insect abundances. In an experiment that directly controlled plant species richness and func tional group richness, we found that insect abundances increased as plant species richness increased, but decreased as plant functional group richness increased. To separate the effects of plant species richness and plant func tional group richness, we created experimental plots that contained 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 plant species from 1-5 functional groups. The contrasting effects of plant species richness and plant functional group richness on insect abundances were caused by three factors. First, lower insect abun dances at higher plant functional group richness were explained by a sam pling effect, caused by the increased likelihood that C4 grasses would be present at higher levels of plant diversity and reduce average insect abun dances by 25%. Second, higher plant productivity increased the abundance of insect resources, which increased insect abundances. The effects of plant productivity may be related indirectly to the level of plant diversity because plant productivity was positively related to plant functional group richness. Third, insect abundances were positively related to plant species richness, possibly due to greater availability of alternate plant resources, greater sea sonal availability of plant resources, or greater vegetational structure at higher levels of plant species richness. These results clarify the frequently observed negative relationship between plant diversity and insect abun dances, and highlight the impact of plant composition on insect community structure in natural ecosystems. HADLEY, J. L. Harvard University Forest, Petersham, MA 01366 USA. Carbon exchange of an old growth eastern hemlock forest: Model pre dictions versus eddy covariance measurements. Predictions of a carbon exchange model for an old-growth eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) forest in central Massachusetts were compared with eddy covariance measurements above the forest in July and August 1999. This forest is about 200 years old, with dominant trees up to 1 m in di ameter and 25 to 30 m tall. The model predicts net photosynthesis (Pn) from photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD) throughout the canopy and from air temperature, water vapor pressure deficit and time of day. Res piration of foliage, wood and soil are functions of temperature. There are separate models for wood respiration during wood production and for the rest of the year. During the test period, the model predicted maximum canopy photosynthesis of 15 ,,mol m-2 s-1, maximum daytime net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of -10 p. mol m-2 s-' and maximum night ecosystem res piration (Rn) of 12 IL mol m-2 s-'. Daytime NEE measured by eddy co variance reached -18 p mol m-2 s-1, but maximum Rn was only -8 p, mol m-2 s-1. Total NEE from the model during daylight was about 40% lower than eddy flux, but modeled Rn was nearly twice the eddy flux. The model predicted carbon release of about 1 g m-2 d-l, while eddy flux showed 1.5 g m-2 d-' of C uptake. These differences could have been due to trapping of air beneath the hemlock canopy, especially during calm nights, when there were periods up to 3 hr long without any measured carbon flux. Long term CO2 profile measurements at a nearby site showed a strong inverse correlation between CO2 storage and momentum transfer from the atmo sphere to the forest. HAGER, H. A. University of Regina, Regina, SK S4S OA2 Canada. Re lationship between Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) abundance and vegetation characteristics in southeastern Minnesota wetlands. Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is a nonindigenous wetland plant in North America. Reductions in wetland plant diversity are hypothesized to be associated with invasion of Lythrum. I surveyed plant characteristics in ten wetlands of varying Lythrum density (O to 72 stems m-2) and average stem heights (O to 218 cm), in southeastern Minnesota. I measured Lythrum density and average stem height, species richness, total live and dead stand ing crop, stem density and height of co-occurring species and water level in six 2 by 0.5 m plots in each wetland (22 July-05 August 1999). Analyses of multiple covariance found that species richness (p = 0.01), total dead standing crop (p = 0.01) and plant diversity (Shannon-Weiner index; p = 0.06) increased with increasing Lythrum stem density, whereas stem density of other plant species decreased (p = 0.005). Species richness (p = 0.03), total live standing crop (p = 0.01) and plant diversity (p = 0.002) increased with increasing Lythrum average stem height. Therefore, the hypothesis that increasing Lythrum abundance is associated with decreases in plant diversity is not supported in these wetlands. HAHN, D. R. University of Washington Seattle WA 98195 USA. Alter ation of microbial community composition and decomposition by an invasive intertidal eelgrass, Zostera japonica, in a Washington estuary. Biological invasions clearly alter the composition and community dynamics of invaded areas and can potentially alter ecosystem processes including productivity, decomposition, nutrient cycling and hydrology. Quantitative data demonstrating such effects, however, are scarce, especially in marine environments. I have conducted research at Padilla Bay, Washington to examine the effect that an introduced intertidal eelgrass, Zostera japonica, has on microbial processes, rates of decomposition, and associated ecosys tem properties in this estuarine environment. A series of observational and experimental studies examined sole source carbon usage (SSCU) by mi crobial assemblages, enumerated bacterial abundance, and assessed rates of decomposition in beds of Z. japonica and in beds of its native congener, Z. marina. Differences in SSCU by microbial assemblages and differences in bacterial enumeration indicate that microbial assemblages differ between beds of the invasive and native species. Decomposition of eelgrass in the field differed between Z. japonica and Z. marina with each eelgrass species decomposing more slowly when placed in beds of its own vegetation type than the vegetation of its congener. These results indicate that this abundant invasive species can alter rates of decomposition and does so mainly by altering the associative decomposer assemblage. HAINES, B. L. and C. PETERSON.

Local die back of human populations is a repeated theme in our history. How many human civilizations have sur vived intact for 1000 or even 500 years? Are we managing the human and life support resources for sustainable quality of life? What alternative spa tial arrangements of land uses might facilitate sustainability? We are de veloping a conceptual package of field measurements, remote sensing and model simulations that will enable resource managers to explore spatially explicit alternative resource uses that may enhance sustainability. Here we describe our multi-phased long term research goals and our Phase I find ings. In Phase I we are determining how long it takes to convert from abandoned cattle pasture back to forest and what are the controls to this forest regeneration. From our studies (1996 to 1998) of seed rain, seed dispersal by birds, seed bank, seed germination, and seed predation on pastures we conclude that seed dispersal is the main limitation. Rotting logs are often the microsites most rapidly colonized by woody plants. Our general approach when coupled with knowledge of human economics and sociology can provide a valuable outreach program to help local decision makers balance their population size with resources to provide sustainable quality of life and sustainable civilizations for their descendents.

The multichannel omnivory model of Polis and Strong predicts that allo chthonous energy subsidies increase the strength of trophic cascades in grazing food webs by enhancing the extent to which omnivorous feeders suppress their in situ resources. This study tested the hypothesis that top down control by generalist arthropod predators in a grazing food web varies with the energy subsidies that these predators receive from feeding on soil litter detritivores. In replicated 8x8-m open and fenced plots of cucumbers and squash, we crossed a detritus-addition with a predator-reduction treat ment. Half of both open and fenced plots received shredded horse manure and straw compost; the other plots (detritus-controls) received no extra detrital input. In the fenced plots we altered rates of predator immigration, and also removed predators, to establish reduced and ambient densities of ground spiders and predacious ground beetles. Springtails (Collembola), a major detritivore, became &gt;10x more abundant in detritus-addition than control plots. The detrital subsidy also increased densities of other detriti vores, resulted in a 2-3x increase in wolf spiders throughout the experi ment, and, increased ground beetle numbers early in the season. However, the detrital subsidy failed to intensify trophic cascades in the grazing food web, because production of cucumbers and squash did not differ between detritus-addition and control plots. Direct manipulation of predator densi ties in the fenced non-detrital treatments uncovered no evidence of trophic cascades in the absence of a subsidy, a result contrary to previous findings in this system. We suggest that preferential feeding by predators on detri tivores and/or intensified intraguild predation, in combination with unusual drought conditions and higher population densities of herbivores than pre vious years, may explain the failure of the detrital subsidy to impact pri mary producers via an enhanced trophic cascade in our experiment.

Impacts of invading European earthworms on understory plant communities in previously worm-free hardwood forests of Minnesota. During the last few decades, European earthworm species have been in vading hardwood forest ecosystems in the northern tier of states in the U.S. These hardwood forests have developed since the last glaciation in the absence of native earthworms, and many stands historically had thick forest floor layers, that served as rooting medium for many species of forest herbs and tree seedlings. Leading edges of earthworm invasion have been iden tified in the Chippewa National Forest of northern Minnesota and a pilot study was conducted. Our objectives were to elucidate the rates and pat terns of change in earthworm populations, forest floor and upper soil ho rizons, herbaceous understory vegetation and seedling demography related to the visible leading edge of earthworm invasion in previously worm-free hardwood forests. A 30 by 150m grid of nested sample plots (45 sample points) was established perpendicular to the visible leading edge in 4 north ern hardwood sites. Forest floor thickness, herbaceous plant diversity and tree seedling density decreased dramatically with increasing earthworm biomass. Successive appearance of 5 different earthworm species and re placement of the E horizon by an A horizon were also associated with the visible leading edge. Heavily impacted stands have been observed with only one species of native herb and virtually no tree seedlings remaining. Therefore, concerns have been raised about the widespread loss of native forest plant species and the stability of hardwood-forest ecosystems. HALL, K. R. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MI 48105, USA. A comparison of age ratios, site fidelity, and spatial arrangement of a shrub-nesting songbird in heavily deer-browsed and less-browsed hab itats. Heavy browsing of low vegetation by white-tailed deer is likely to change the suitability of forest habitat for songbird species, such as the Black throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), that depend on understory habitat. My work examines the male age ratios (first year breeders vs. older birds), return rates, and spatial arrangement of breeding blue warblers in heavily-browsed and less-browsed hardwood forests in northern Michigan. All study sites had patches of dense understory; in the two heavily-browsed sites the understory was a mosaic of browsed hardwood stems and patches of unbrowsed balsam fir, while in the two less-browsed sites it was pri marily hardwoods with little browse evidence. In both heavily-browsed sites and one less-browsed site, most males were older, and the ratio of older birds to yearlings was similar between years. Age ratios in the other less-browsed site varied yearly. In all sites, most returning males estab lished territories that overlapped areas used in previous years, although some movements, especially of yearlings returning as older males, were documented. Females showed less of a tendency to reoccupy the same territory. Territories in the heavily-browsed sites were concentrated in areas with dense patches of fir saplings, but were more evenly spaced in less browsed sites. In all sites, 38-60% of banded adults returned to the site per year, with no consistent difference between returns to heavily- and less browsed sites. The density of breeding pairs in the heavily-browsed sites ranged from 1.6-2.0 pairs per 10/ha, while in less-browsed sites densities ranged from 1.8-2.4 pairs/10 ha. In these sites, blue warbler populations tended to have similar characteristics, although the distribution patterns were less even in heavily-browsed sites. Manipulation of balsam fir in the understory may be a useful management tool for providing short-term hab itat for shrub-nesters in Michigan forests with high deer densities. HALL, R. 0. University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071. Relating or ganic matter flow with experimentally measured interaction strength between two benthic grazers and algae. Interaction strength can be estimated based on consumption rates of prey taxa and prey numbers; these estimates can correlate with experimentally measured interaction strength in rocky intertidal communities. In this study I compared organic matter flow with interaction strength between two ben thic grazers and their epilithic diatom resources in a stream at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Using bioenergetics approaches I estimated consumption rates of algal biomass as a whole and of two species of com mon diatoms by two benthic grazers: Heptagenia, a mayfly, and Glosso soma, a caddisfly. At the same time I manipulated these grazers to exper imentally measure their impact on algae using in-stream cages. There was a significant positive relationship between modeled and measured interac tion strength for total algal biomass (r2=0.60) and for one common diatom, Tabellaria (r2=0.81) using both benthic grazers. This relationship was much weaker for the other common diatom, Eunotia. Though modeled interaction strength could predict measured interaction strength, modeled estimates were always higher than measured ones: Five times for algal biomass and about 250 times for Tabellaria, which implies that grazers should impact algae much more than they actually did. This result is pos sible because diatom populations may be turning over several times during the two-week experiment. Experimentally measured interaction strength can be predicted from interaction strength estimated based on consumption rates, but future studies should address time scales of resource turnover. HALL, S. R. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637. Stoichiometric gradients influence community composition of consumers. Recent experiments suggest that elemental composition of resources may influence population dynamics of consumers. Key findings from this body 112 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="74">of work show that elemental composition of food (i.e., food quality) can affect growth efficiency of consumers, and that consumers can be nutrient limited. Nevertheless, to date there is no long-term experimental data to determine if consumer species are more abundant in environments in which the elemental composition of their food more closely matches their own composition. To address this question, I experimentally created a light- (us ing shade cloth and duckweeds):phosphorus gradient in semi-natural pond mesocosms to manipulate the ratio of carbon:phosphorus of seston. Shading reduced ecosystem-level productivity and increased the relative availability of inorganic nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and ammonium), indicating in creased relative light limitation of autotrophs. Although each mesocosm started initially with similar, species-diverse communities of zooplankton, species with high C:P body composition (calanoid copepods) were most abundant in treatments with high light:phosphorus ratios, and species with low C:P body composition (daphnid cladocerans) were more abundant (al though variable) in treatments with low light:phosphorus ratios. These re sults suggest that variation in food quality, mediated through mechanisms involving elemental constitution of consumers and resources, can influence consumer composition. HAMBURG, S. P, I R. D. YANAI2 and M. A. ARTHUR.3 'Brown Uni versity, Providence, RI, USA; 2SUNY , Syracuse, NY, USA; 3University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA. Biotic control of calcium de cline in forest soils. Concern is growing that prolonged exposure to acidic precipitation, along with declining Ca in precipitation, decreases the availability of base cations in forest soils. This concern stems from observations of declining base saturation in the soils of mature forest stands in North America and Europe, the already low base status of most northeastern US soils, and an inability to identify pools of available Ca sufficient to insure long-term forest growth. We suggest that forest succession controls calcium cycling and changes in calcium availability in northern hardwood forests to a greater degree than does acid precipitation. Understanding the relative importance of biotic and abiotic processes to cation biogeochemistry is critical to the effective design of environmental policy. Biotic regulation of Ca cycling is particularly important in regions where historic changes in land-use have resulted in near synchronous aging of forests. When environmental stress and forest succession occur simultaneously, declines in streamwater and soil calcium concentrations could mistakenly be assumed to indicate an thropogenic acidification rather than the effects of land-use change. To determine the importance of successional changes in the northern hardwood forest on calcium availability we measured changes in the following three indicators in stands of different ages: Terrestrial snail mass in 7 sites over 18 years; Ca concentration of leaf litter in 13 sites; and forest floor calcium in the same 13 sites over 15 years. We found that snail abundance, Ca content and Ca concentrations in the forest floor and Ca concentrations in litterfall were all significantly higher in forest stands &lt;35 years old com pared with older stands. An input-output model of young forest stands indicates that vegetative uptake of mineral soil calcium suppplies about 7 g-Ca m-2 Y-1 to the rest of the ecosystem. This contrasts with older forests (&gt;35 y), where the mineral soil provides negligible net calcium to the ecosystem (1 g-Ca m-2 Yl]). These observations support our hypothesis that synchronous aging of previously harvested forests in the northeastern US may be a major contributor to patterns of declining soil and streamwater Ca concentrations.

Elevated atmospheric CO2 may lead to changes in levels of insect herbiv ory. However, it has remained a matter of speculation how results from experiments with only a few species of insects and plants in controlled environments will generalize to natural ecosystems. We measured leaf dam age from herbivory in an intact forest understory in an ongoing FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiment. Using digital photography and image analysis, we quantified leaf damage to three species of deciduous trees over a growing season from insects representing three distinct feeding guilds. The total amount of leaf tissue damaged varied little between treatments both early in the season (ambient 5%, elevated 3.5%) and late in the season (ambient 9%, elevated 7.5%). Overall, the greatest amount of leaf damage came from herbivores that removed tissue, with skeletonized tissue next and galled tissue covering the least amount of leaf area. We found a sig nificant interaction between tree species and CO2 treatment . Red maple (Acer rubrum) experienced the same amount of leaf damage in the two treatments. Winged elm (Ulmus alata) experienced significantly greater damage in the ambient treatments, whereas, sweet gum (Liquidambar styr aciflua) showed a trend toward more damage in the elevated treatments. Correlations between leaf damage and total leaf nitrogen, total phenolics, starch and soluble sugars are also discussed. The results of this study dem onstrate that CO2 effects on herbivory cannot be generalized to a whole forest. HANE, E. N. Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA. The inter actions of multiple disturbances: Effects on northern hardwood forest community structure. The northern hardwood forest has seen a recent explosion of understory beech saplings (Fagus grandifolia) due to the presence of an exotic disease, beech bark disease. Removal experiments of beech saplings have shown that 40% of the mortality of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings is due to the presence of beech. Shading experiments show that while a large proportion of the negative effect of beech on sugar maple is from shading, allelopathy provides an alternative explanation. Greenhouse allelopathy ex periments show that sugar maple seedlings exposed to beech leaf leachate have significantly lower biomass and leaf area than those which get the same nutrients, but without the secondary compounds that exist in the beech leaf leachate. The shift in understory community structure is partic ularly important after the ice storm of January 1998, which created many new canopy gaps. The severity and density of beech bark disease, and thus beech thicket sprouting, depends largely on land-use history, with areas that were previously logged having the highest density of beech saplings, and areas which were managed for sugar maple syrup production having the lowest. The severity of the ice damage is correlated with the density of beech, and also with the degree of beech bark disease damage. The interactions of all these disturbances (land-use, beech bark disease and ice storm) indicate that beech will be increasingly important in the future, and at the expense of sugar maple. HANNUNEN, S.' and B. EKBOM.2 'University of Helsinki, Finland; 2Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden . Host plant influence on movement patterns and the subsequent distribution of Lygus rugulipennis (Heteroptera: Miridae) nymphs. The objectives of this work were to study: 1.) if host plant species affects movement patterns of nymphs of a highly polyphagous herbivore, Lygus rugulipennis (Heteroptera: Miridae); and 2.) if and how these movement patterns influence the spatial distribution of individuals in heterogeneous landscapes. We observed movement patterns of individual nymphs on two host plant species, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Tripleurospermum ino dorum (scentless mayweed), in laboratory, and we used the observed move ment patterns to model redistribution of nymphs with an individual based movement model and with a diffusion approximation of random walk. We tested the predictions of the models by following redistribution of nymphs on small arenas (30 X 30 cm and 60 x 60 cm) consisting of the two plant species in the laboratory. Probability of moving (0.71 on wheat and 0.65 on T. inodorum) and the distribution of turning angles did not differ among plants, but the total time spent moving and the net displacements were significantly longer on wheat than on T. inodorum. In the arenas most nymphs (50-100 %o) were found on T. inodorum after the period of redis tribution (2 and 8 hours in the smaller and larger arenas respectively). Both the simulation model and the diffusion approximation of random walk pre dicted the redistribution well. The ability of the models to predict distri bution in heterogeneous space even though they were parametrized with data collected in homogenous vegetation, suggests that the observed dis tribution of individuals was actually caused by the differences in movement patterns, and not by e.g. strong attraction to T. inodorum.

While it is increasingly apparent that ecology is highly relevant to human wellbeing, ecological education for citizens in the U.S. is ad hoc and occurs largely via the popular media. The effectiveness of this education is es pecially poorly known for children. The information received by boys and girls may be filtered by parents and reflect value judgements more heavily than scientific knowledge. We surveyed 6-8th grade students in the Yel lowstone region to determine: the accuracy of ecological knowledge of children relative to their parents; if boys and girls differ in ecological un derstanding; if children in fast-growing urban counties differ in ecological knowledge from those in slow-growing agricultural counties; and if accu racy of ecological understanding was related to the child's source of infor mation. A pilot study of 68 students revealed that less than 50% adequately understood key facts about three prominent issues: wolf reintroduction; brucellosis infection of bison and cattle; and whirling disease in trout. The source of information most commonly identified was television. Integrating ecological education into public school curricula may be a more effective means of improving the ecological knowledge of children. HARLEY, C. D. G. University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. Recruitment, density thresholds, and interannual variability in inter action strength. In order to make generalizations beyond the typically limited scope of ecological experiments, we need to understand the ways in which the re sults are context dependent. I measured the per capita interaction strength of an intertidal predator (Pisaster ochraceus) on its invertebrate prey in the same location in two different years. Although Pisaster densities were sim ilar between years, the recruitment of prey species was much heavier in 1998 than in 1999. Because Pisaster cannot suppress a dominant prey item (Balanus glandula) below a certain density, the weak recruitment year re sulted in little difference between exclosures and controls, and low mea sured interaction strengths. In the heavy recruitment year, Pisaster exclu sion resulted in rapid community changes, and identified Pisaster as a much stronger interactor. Spatial and temporal variation in Pisaster's effects can therefore be determined, at least in part, by variability in the recruitment of its resource base. HARMON, J. P and D. A. ANDOW.

Generalist arthropod predators can have an enormous influence on the pop ulation dynamics of target prey, yet their interactions with alternative foods often make it difficult to predict the predator's response to different com munities of target and alternative foods. To investigate the effects of alter native food on predation, we studied the polyphagous coccinellid, Coleo megilla maculata DeGeer and its most common prey in Minnesota maize: European corn borer eggs, corn leaf aphids, and corn pollen. We conducted a study with large field cages to determine how the presence of aphids and pollen influence the predation of high and low densities of European corn borer eggs by C. maculata. Our results indicate (1) Per capita predation on European corn borer eggs was density dependent in the absence of alter native foods; (2) Per capita predation on eggs was lower and inversely density dependent when corn pollen was available; and (3) Cages with large corn leaf aphid densities had small and inconsistent differences in egg predation from cages with low aphid densities, regardless of pollen avail ability. Laboratory studies help show how the foraging behavior of indi vidual C. maculata can be influenced by the type and density of available foods. An understanding of how alternative prey influence predator for aging for target prey could be an important step in facilitating effective biological control by generalist arthropod predators.

Although decomposition is a continuously evolving process, three stages are generally recognized: 1) an early one of rapid losses dominated by leaching; 2) a middle stage dominated by the degradation of cellulose and the formation of stable organic matter; and 3) the last stage of very slow loss dominated by the degradation of stable organic matter. The LIDET (Longterm Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team) project was de signed to examine the degree climate and substrate quality controlled the second and to a lesser extent the third stage of decomposition. A total of 28 sites participated and after 9 years this team effort has yielded interesting insights on the way these two basic controls interact. Climate and substrate quality both controlled the rate of decomposition and the formation of stable organic matter in the second stage. Their influence on the decom position during the stage dominated by stable organic matter was less clear and may require new experiments that separate the formation and degra dation of this material. Several future experiments are suggested that would offer additional insight into controls on decomposition of the third kind. HARMS, K. E. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, 93106, USA. Habitat associations of tropical trees and shrubs within a 50-ha forest plot in Panama. Traditional analyses of habitat associations of plants often make the as sumption that individual stems can be treated as independent sample units. Due primarily to limited dispersal distances and the generally contagious spatial patterns of recruitment, this assumption is untenable for most spe cies of plants. I developed a statistical test for examining habitat associa tions of mapped plants which incorporates the spatial structure of plant populations, eliminating the assumption of independence among stems. I applied the test to tropical trees and shrubs within the 50-ha Forest Dy namics Project plot in Panama. Few species were significantly associated with specific habitat types, but many species avoided a seasonally inun dated swamp, i.e., most species' distribution patterns with respect to habitat heterogeneity within the 50-ha plot were similar. These results support the hypothesis that specialization to the physical environment is not among the principal mechanisms maintaining diversity in this tropical forest. HARRIS, L. C., M. A. KHAN, B.

Plants that live in desert playas of the Great Basin must simultaneously tolerate very high concentrations of salt and high temperature. An isother mal calorimetric method was used to measure metabolic heat rates and CO2 rates of stem tips and leaves from Salicornia utahensis grown from seed in different NaCl concentrations of 0 to 1 M. Metabolic rates were mea sured at nine temperatures from 5 to 45?C. The predicted optimal growth rate was at 0.8 to 1 M salt and 25?C. The maximum temperature tolerated is an approximately linear function of salt concentration, about 20?C at 0 M salt and about 32?C at 1 M. Thus salt and temperature stresses are not additive, rather they oppose one another (i.e. at higher salt concentrations plants will tolerate higher temperatures). This is exactly the pattern seen in the field. HARRISON, J. A. and P. A. MATSON. Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. Greenhouse gas emissions from drainage waters in an intensively farmed, subtropical valley. The production and emission of nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from surface waters draining agricultural regions is not well understood, especially in non-temperate regions where the most rapid agricultural intensification is currently occurring. We measured the rates and patterns of N20, CH4, and CO2 emissions from freshwater drain age systems and estuaries receiving agricultural and mixed agricultural/ urban drainage water from the intensively farmed Yaqui Valley of Sonora, Mexico. N20 emissions in both pure agriculture and mixed urban/agricul ture drainage systems were high (means: 4.02-23.5 ng N20-N cm-2 hr1) with N20 emissions increasing as much as 600% following a valley-wide fertilization/irrigation event. Flux measurements along estuarine transects revealed that N20 production is sustained above levels predicted by dilution calculations, suggesting that N20 production is not limited by dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the drainage system. Rates of CO2 and CH4 emission varied dramatically over the course of a growing season (0.81-20.46 ,ug 114 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="76">CO, cm-2 hr-', and 0.37-4911.53 jig CH4 cm-2 hr-'respectively), and there was a clear trend toward increasing CO2 emissions over the two months following irrigation. CH4 emissions were greater in the freshwater drainage and estuary (mean flux: 799.92 ,ug CH4 cm-2 hr-1) receiving mixed agri cultural-urban drainage than in the freshwater drainage and estuary receiv ing purely agricultural drainage (mean flux: 113.21 ,ug CH4 cm-2 hr1). Our results show that N20 emissions from drainage waters in the Yaqui Valley are high, and indicate that rates of greenhouse gas emissions from surface drainage waters are tightly linked to upland development and management practices.

Heavy livestock grazing around the turn of the 20th Century coupled with fire suppression changed the structure of ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern US. These changes may have substantially reduced the rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling within these forests. I examined the effects of different levels of ecological restoration on needle decomposition and nutrient release in a ponderosa pine forest near Flagstaff, AZ. The two degrees of restoration were partial restoration, where the forest structure was returned to pre-EuroAmerican conditions by thinning, and complete restoration, where thinning was combined with the removal of most of the forest floor, the addition of native grass litter, and the reintroduction of fire. Decomposition rates were higher in the restoration treatments compared to the control over the 40-month study period, but the magnitude of these differences was small (&lt; than 5% of the original mass). Nitrogen and phosphorus were retained in litter to a greater degree in the complete res toration treatment relative to the other treatments, but again these differ ences were relatively minor (&lt;10% of the original nutrient mass). My results suggest the structural changes that have occurred in these forests since EuroAmerican settlement have had only a modest influence on pon derosa pine needle litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics; the direct effects of frequent fire on decomposition and nutrient release appear to be far more important to the function of these ecosystems. HARTMAN, K. M. and B. C. MCCARTHY. hio University, Athens, OH 45701, U.S.A. Forest understory restoration following the removal of an invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii, is a non-indigenous shrub that has aggressively invaded the midstory of many forests in southwestern Ohio. This has had a negative effect on the recruitment, growth, and overall diversity of native plants. The objectives of this study were to assess hon eysuckle control methods and to evaluate the effect of honeysuckle removal on the growth and survival of native seedlings. To account for heteroge neous environments this study used a randomized complete block design (N = 8) with three treatments: Control (unmanipulated), cut (honeysuckle cut, stumps herbicided), and injection (honeysuckle stems injected with herbicide). In each treatment plot, ten seedlings of six species were planted. Half of the seedlings were grown in browse tubes to evaluate the extent of deer herbivory. Modes of mortality were assessed and categorized as death due to drought, browsing, transplant shock, or fungal pathogen. The species used and their respective survival rates are as follows: Fraxinus pennsyl vanica (85.0%), Quercus muhlenbergii (60.4%), Juglans nigra (54.2%), Prunus serotina (47.9%), Cercis canadensis (36.3%), and Cornus florida (15.0%). Honeysuckle mortality was similar in the two treatments (99%), suggesting that both are efficacious control methods. Overall, seedling sur vival was low (49%) due to a severe drought (PDSI &lt; -3). Seedling sur vival in the two treatments (cut, 57.4%; injection, 53.1%) was not signif icantly different from each other but was significantly different than in the control (40.4%; P &lt; 0.05). Survival was also significantly different (P &lt; 0.01) among treatments, species, and browse tubes. Two-way interactions between species by tubing treatment and species by mode of mortality were found to be significant (P K 0.05). Overall, the data suggest that multiple factors contributed to the survival of the seedlings. HARTZ-RUBIN, J. S. and B. H. DELUCIA. University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. Variation in biomass increase of understory saplings exposed in situ to elevated CO2. Tree species that have indeterminate growth may have larger growth en hancements in elevated compared to ambient atmospheric CO2. We mea sured annual growth of six species of understory deciduous saplings in an intact forest exposed to Free-Air CO2 Enrichment from 1996 through 1999. Stem length and basal diameter were measured five times over three years in ambient (-36 Pa) and elevated (-56 Pa) CO2 experimental plots. Bio mass was estimated from allometric equations. We found that different species responded differently to elevated CO2. For example, sweetgum (in determinate; Liquidambar styraciflua) grew 8% more and red maple (de terminate; Acer rubrum) grew 6% less in elevated compared to ambient CO2. The growth of winged elm (Ulmus alata) did not differ between CO2 treatments. Based on these results, we predict that the continuing increase in atmospheric CO2 will favor species with indeterminate relative to deter minate growth forms, thus altering forest composition. HASKINS, K. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ USA 86011. Nurse plant associations cause shifts in the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with pinyon pine (Pinus edulis). The importance of nurse plant associations has been widely documented and ranges from providing shade to providing the only means of seedling establishment. Seedlings in harsh environments are often more dependent on a nurse relationship than seedlings in more benign environments. In addition to benefits provided by a nurse, seedling performance in unfavor able environmental conditions can be aided by mycorrhizal relationships. Previous studies have examined the effects of nurse plants on seedling establishment, growth rate, and survivorship, but few studies have exam ined the role of nurse plants in affecting seedling mycorrhizal dynamics. Factors such as intraspecific competition, amelioration of environmental effects, and nutrient release after death of a nurse plant may affect mycor rhizal levels and fungal species composition among establishing seedlings. This study addressed the following question: Does the level of ectomycor rhizal (EM) colonization and EM fungal community structure vary among young pinyons nursed by a live conspecific, nursed by a dead conspecific, or lacking a nurse plant? This study was conducted north of the San Fran cisco peaks in northern Arizona. Because soils in this area are low in nutrients and moisture, pinyon seedling establishment is improbable with out a nurse associate and mycorrhizae. Nine trees of each type were sam pled for EM colonization and community composition in May of 1999. Fungal community data were examined using an ordination technique per formed with DECODA software. Although EM colonization in the open trees was 1.6 times greater than colonization in the seedlings nursed by dead trees, there were no significant differences in EM colonization among the three treatment groups. There was a significant shift in EM fungal communities between seedlings with no nurse and seedlings nursed by live trees. Although there were no significant differences between seedlings nursed by live or dead pinyons, the fungal community of pinyons nursed by a dead pinyon was intermediate between that of pinyons nursed by a live pinyon and those found in the open. This is one of the few studies demonstrating that nurse plant associations not only have direct effects on plant growth, but also have indirect effects on seedling mycorrhizal dy namics. HASTINGS, A. and L. W BOTSFORD. University of California, Davis CA 95616 USA. Are marine reserves for fisheries and for biodiversity compatible? Using a modeling approach, we compare and contrast the design of net works of marine reserves for two different, commonly stated goals: (1) Maintaining high yield in fisheries and (2) conserving biodiversity, in an idealized setting using simple models. The models, which are simplifica tions of discrete-time continuous-space models, describe larval dispersal over a system of evenly spaced reserves of equal size. We initially dem onstrate that since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves, cost con siderations dictate the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast, the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside or reserves, which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves, but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances.

The role of riparian habitats and stream networks in facilitating the spread of invasive species. Species-rich habitats, such as riparian zones, can function either as refugia from disturbance or as sources of propagules dispersal. Studies have ex amined longitudinal patterns in riparian plant communities, but few have considered how species occurrence and community composition vary in relation to the distribution of riparian habitat at the level of the entire stream. To examine how the organization of the stream network and ripar ian habitat might influence the ability of a riparian corridor to function as movement corridors for invasive plant species, I examined spatial patterns of diversity and composition, and causal environmental factors for a fourth order stream network in northern New Jersey. A total of 67 sites were sampled along the main stream and the tributaries in the 300 hectare wa tershed and a total of 385 species were identified and categorized by veg etation type and invasion status. Multiple regressions and ordinations were used to relate environmental factors with species richness and community composition. Variation in slope and stream channel characteristics were important in defining three predominant riparian habitat types: Low-gra dient, sedge-dominated marshes; high-gradient floodplain terraces; and in termediate-gradient riparian wetlands. Species diversity and invasive spe cies richness was greater in the more diverse riparian wetland habitat type, but few invasive species were in common between patches of this habitat type. Species diversity, including invasive species numbers, were lowest in the marsh habitat. The overall distribution patterns of invasive species sug gest that the riparian corridor might facilitate the spread of invasive upland species into the surrounding upland but less so for riparian-restricted spe cies, in part due to the non-continuous nature of the riparian habitat types defined by the geomorphic criteria.

Addition of sawdust to soils to enhance na tive grass persistence following removal of introduced nitrogen-fixing shrub. The invasion of California coastal grasslands by non-native nitrogen-fixing shrubs is a widespread phenomenon. Restoration of these grasslands fol lowing invasion may be restricted in part because of increases in soil ni trogen due directly to nitrogen fixation. Our experiments are designed to quantify the impact of increased soil nitrogen on native grasses, and com petitive interactions between native and non-native grasses. Our focus is a nitrogen-fixing shrub, French broom (Genista monspessulana), an intro duced invader in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area which requires manual removal. We applied sawdust at the rate of 650 g/m2/y to decrease nitrogen availability in plots containing native perennial grasses only, ex otic annual grasses only, and perennials and annuals in combination; a separate set of these treatments received no sawdust. We monitored soil nitrogen availability over one growing season and measured plant biomass at the end of that season. We found an unexpected stimulation effect of sawdust addition, whereby one of the three native grasses grew significantly larger in sawdust addition plots. There was no effect of sawdust addition on soil nitrogen availability as we assayed it in a 7-day aerobic laboratory incubation, although perennials-only plots had significant effects on nitro gen availability, irrespective of sawdust. The importance of timing, regu larity, and quality of carbon addition to soils in the restoration process are critical. HAUFF, R. D. and K. C. EWEL.

Forest clearing for short-term economic benefits is a well-documented cause of mangrove destruction worldwide. Estimating harvest rates is need ed to assess a forest's capacity for providing human and ecological goods and services. On the high volcanic island of Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, remoteness and high annual rainfall preclude regular aerial photography coverage. Harvesting trees for firewood and construction by islanders is the primary cause of forest clearing. The Kosrae State Division of Forestry and Wildlife and the USDA Forest Service have quantified recent annual harvest rates for the island's mangrove forests. Stump de composition characteristics such as presence and quantity of bark, tannins, sapwood, exposed hardwood, prop roots, and structural integrity, as well as seedling growth rates in terms of node elongation provided data for estimating harvest gap age within two to three years. Data obtained from harvested gaps along transects suggest that 8.4% of the island's mangrove forest area has been harvested over the last 10 years. Calculations of wood volume harvested were comparable at 8.7% of standing volume. Harvest rates based on weighted averages have increased from 0.6% to 1.5% of total mangrove forest per year during this time. HAVLICEK, T D., T. F H. ALLEN and J. M. NORMAN.

Few ecological experiments have explicitly tested how complexity func tions in ecological systems because complex behavior is nonlinear, multi scaled, and therefore difficult to measure. Large-scale comparisons indicate that complex ecosystems are better energy degraders than simple systems. To test how complexity and stress affect terrestrial ecosystem thermody namics, we created different plant ecosystems by growing a single strain of soybean (Glycine max) in two separate wind chambers with overstory or understory wind conditions. Infrared thermometers that measured veg etation radiative output monitored ecosystem energy use. Vegetation ex posed to wind speeds different from rearing conditions tested stress effects and comparisons of energy use among mixes of plants tested complexity effects. Mixes had tall plants in an overstory and short plants in an under story. "Natural" mixes contained tall plants reared in fast wind conditions in the vegetation overstory and short plants reared in slow wind conditions in the understory. "Inverted" mixes contained plants in the opposite con figuration. Results showed unmixed vegetation reradiated the least energy in its rearing wind condition. Increased energy loss is an indication of stress. Comparisons of mixes showed overstory wind reared plants behaved similarly in both mixes. The understory wind reared plants, however, re radiated more energy in the "inverted" mix (p-value&lt;0.001). In the "nat ural" mix, understory wind reared plants are placed in a protective context, sheltered from fast wind speeds by the overstory. A contextual relationship between the whole vegetation and its constituent vegetations conveys great er thermodynamic functionality. Although both mixes contain the same types and number of components, only the "natural" mix is complex be cause it has upper hierarchical levels that constrain the boundaries of lower level behavior. HAWKES, C. V. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. Dif ferences in nitrogen uptake modified by microbiotic soil crusts and AM fungi for herbs in a xeric Florida shrubland. Microbiotic soil crusts are widespread and known to affect nutrient cycling in arid regions of the world. How crusts interact with vascular plants is less well understood. The primary source of N for herbs in a xeric Florida shrubland was hypothesized to be microbiotic soil crusts that are dominated by cyanobacteria and algae. In order to test this, total nitrogen and delta '5N were measured in plant tissue, soil crusts, and soils. Delta 15N of herbs was significantly different for species associated with arbuscular-mycor rhizal (AM) fungi and those that were not. Comparison of isotopic signa tures suggests that the two AM species, Eryngium cuneifolium and Hyper icum cumulicola, utilize crusts as a primary source of nitrogen whereas the two non-mycorrhizal species, Polygonella basiramia and Paronychia char tacea, do not and may actually compete with crust organisms for limited N. Similar delta 15N values for Hypericum and Eryngium imply no frac tionation differences by the AM fungi. However, Hypericum total N content was significantly lower and mycorrhizal infection rates were higher, sug gesting that total transfer of N from mycorrhizae to the plant may be lower in Hypericum. Among all four species, total N was greatest for Paronychia and Eryngium yet they were found in microsites of different N levels: Paronychia was found in the most nitrogen-rich, and Eryngium in the most nitrogen-poor soils. In contrast, Hypericum and Polygonella had similar nitrogen tissue contents and occurred in similar microsites with interme diate levels of nitrogen, but have very different delta I5N values possibly due to use of crust vs. soil as a source of nitrogen, or differential uptake and/or loss of the heavy isotope. 116 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="78">HAWKINS, C. P. Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322, USA. Re sponse of stream invertebrate assemblages to perturbation: Persistence of structure in the face of marked changes in species composition. Species richness and diversity are often used to characterize the biological integrity of stream ecosystems, and a loss of species richness is generally believed to be one of the most sensitive measures of natural or human caused stress in streams. Furthermore, common taxa are generally thought to be more tolerant of stress than rare taxa. I used data from 234 unper turbed reference streams and 254 streams draining logged watersheds in California to examine how stream perturbation associated with watershed alteration affected stream invertebrate species richness, diversity, and spe cies composition. On average, both richness and diversity of assemblages in streams draining altered watersheds were nearly identical to that ob served in reference streams implying no adverse effect of logging. How ever, assemblage composition varied markedly between perturbed and ref erence sites, and the nature of some of the differences were unexpected. Taxa that were common at reference sites were more strongly affected by watershed alteration than rarer taxa, and rare taxa increased, on average, in both absolute and relative abundance at stressed sites. These patterns might be explained by how watershed perturbation altered stream habitats. Rather than reducing the overall niche space available to animals, the com plex of stream habitats available to invertebrates apparently shifted from one position on the stream habitat continuum to another position such that species replacement occurred but richness and diversity were largely un affected. These results imply that measures of compositional similarity may be far more sensitive to some types of stress in streams than some aggregate measures of assemblage structure that are commonly used to measure biotic condition in streams.

This experiment was designed to determine the effects of nutrient stress on inbreeding depression in Cucurbita texana. Families having inbreeding coefficients 0, 0.250, 0.500, 0.750, and 0.875 were produced by a series of controlled crosses. A random sample of seeds was germinated in the green house and a random sample of seedlings was selected for transplant to one of two experimental gardens. The low nutrient garden (stressed plants) was fertilized with 10% of the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium rec ommended for commercial production of cucurbits. The high nutrient gar den (non-stressed plants) was fertilized to 50% of the recommended level. Plants were monitored for male flower production, percentage pollen ger mination, pollen growth rate, female flower production, fruit production, percentage seed germination, and time to seed germination of progeny. Some measures of male function showed decreases in more inbred families. For example, staminate flower production decreased by as much as 35% in inbred families, except for the most inbred (F=0.875) families. The effect was more dramatic under stress, with plants grown in the non stressed plots producing nearly twice as many staminate flowers as stressed plants for all levels of inbreeding. Rates of pollen germination were ap proximately 15% across all treatments, but variance in pollen tube growth rate decreased with inbreeding: Standard deviations for F=0.75 families were 54% of standard deviations for F=0.25 families. Reduced variation in pollen tube growth rate was more dramatic in stressed plants, with stan dard deviations only 67% of those in non-stressed plants. Female flower production was reduced in more inbred families under stress conditions, but no significant differences were observed among non-stressed. Fruit pro duction was similar among plants grown in non-stressed conditions (F=0: 61 per plant vs F=0.75: 52 per plant), but differed significantly (F=0: 37 per plant vs F=0.75: 24 per plant) under stress.

Changes in the distribution of forest and agriculture lands alter riparian vegetation, which modifies the physical conditions of the stream habitat. To understand the impacts of this landscape mosaic on stream habitat con ditions, we sampled riparian corridor and stream habitat conditions in three adjacent watersheds. Land cover categories (pasture, mixed and forest) were determined with aerial photographs based on percent area covered by trees. Sites were corridors of first order streams, located from 400 to 600 m elevation in the wet forest life zone. In each of 35 sites, vegetation structure and composition, and characteristics of the stream substrate were assessed. Understory vegetation in the forest sites was mainly shrubs, herbs and ferns, and the mixed and pasture sites were dominated by grasses, vines and bare soil. Syzigium jambos and Spathodea campanulata, exotics, and Guarea guidonia, a native were the most common tree species. In an or dination analysis (NMDS) of stream substrate characteristics, surrounding land cover explained &gt;40% of the variation among stream sites. There was a positive relationship between tree cover and percent dissolved oxygen, and a negative relationship between tree cover and percent of substrate covered by mud or eroded soil. The amount of woody debris in the streams tended to increase with forest cover. Tree cover, based on aerial photo graphs, was a landscape characteristic that effectively predicted stream hab itat condition. HEATON, J. S.,' A. KIESTER,2 M. E. CABLK3 and D. A.

A geomorphological approach to reptile habitat relation ships in the California Mojave Desert: The LizLand model. Current state-of-the-art vertebrate habitat models in the California Mojave Desert are based primarily on vegetation. These vegetation based models inadequately describe reptile habitat in this arid environment. We have developed a new concept of reptile habitat in the California Mojave Desert that is based upon geomorphology, spatial heterogeneity, landuse condition and roads, resulting in the LizLand Model. The study area includes Joshua Tree National Park, the Marine Corps Air/Ground Combat Center and sur rounding Bureau of Land Management off-road recreation vehicle (ORV) areas. The focal species are, among others, Callisaurus draconoides, Cnem idophorus tigris and Uta stansburiana. Our study shows that both reptile presence/absence and road distribution and density are significantly depen dant on geomorphology. These relationships are effected by conditions of spatial heterogeneity and/or landuse condition. In addition, we have shown that certain lizard species have affinities for dirt roads that may serve to artificially increase their numbers in a highly roaded environment. LizLand has greatly enhanced our current understanding of reptile distributions in the California Mojave Desert and arid environments in general, as well as the effects of the anthropogenic stressors landuse condition and roads.

We present a model to explain the organic oxygen isotope signature in grass leaf blades and to show that grass blades are analogous to tree rings in recording environmental information. The growth portion of the model is based on intercalary meristem growth. Cells for grass blade growth result from cell division at the basal intercalary meristem, but receive carbohy drates for growth from distal portions of the grass blade. The isotope model is based on isotope tree ring models that incorporate the ways in which relative humidity and water source information influence organic oxygen isotope ratios. This model was applied, with slight modification, to grass leaves. The results of the model agreed well with observed oxygen isotope ratios in grass blade cellulose. Therefore, we expect that oxygen isotope ratios of cellulose along the length of a grass leaf blade provide a contin uous environmental record during the period of leaf growth. HELLMANN, J. J. Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, U.S.A. . Is timing everything? The temporal interation between an insect and its host plants. A major goal in ecology is to understand the degree to which species interactions control population dynamics. While the type and frequency of interaction clearly play a role in population regulation, the timing of as sociation also can be important. In the Bay checkerspot butterfly (Euphy dryas editha bayensis), pre-diapause larvae forage on two hostplant genera that senesce at different rates and times. Larval starvation from early se Oral Presentation Abstracts 117</page><page sequence="79">nescence of hostplants is a primary determinant of butterfly population size. Thus, the onset and duration of the insect-plant interaction as well as the diet choice of larvae may strongly influence butterfly abundance. I inves tigated how the diversity and abundance of host plants, larval diet behavior, and altered host plant senescence affect larval growth rate and abundance through time. Empirical results suggest that access to both hostplants is indeed a critical determinant of survival to diapause. Theoretical results suggest, however, that the timing of senescence is even more important to population size than the presence of multiple hosts. These findings indicate that temporal shifts in hostplant senescence, as are possible under climatic change, may alter the interaction between butterflies and their hostplants, possibly causing precipitous butterfly population declines. The results also highlight the potential for temporal change in other interspecific interac tions, possibly leading to changes in the abundance of a wide variety of species. HELLQUIST, C.,' S. D.

The extent of invasion and eradication of the non-native, invasive estuarine plant, Spartina anglica, in Puget Sound, WA, USA. In Pacific Northwest estuaries, the non-indigenous, invasive cordgrass, Spartina anglica, has become a serious invader of mud flat and salt marsh habitats. Introduced into Washington state in 1961, Spartina anglica has expanded via seeds and clonal growth to cover a large portion of these habitats in northern Puget Sound. With prolific rhizomatous growth, Spar tina anglica, converts tidal mud flats into elevated salt marshes with del eterious consequences for eelgrasses, Zostera sp., and native mud flat spe cies assemblages. The effects on native salt marsh communities is un known. Despite the observed extensive invasion, little quantitative data exists on its current extent and the success of eradication treatments (her bicide application and mowing) which began in 1997. Here we provide the first quantitative estimates of the invasion and eradication. In consultation with the Washington State Department of Agriculture Noxious Weed Con trol Board, we conservatively estimate that the pre-eradication invasion covered nearly 7,000 acres in 1997. The shorelines of Port Susan Bay, Skagit Bay, Admiralty Inlet and Saratoga Passage were mainly affected while more northern mudflats in Padilla Bay and southern shorelines near Hood Canal and Bainbridge Island had sparse distributions. We currently estimate that eradication treatments have been applied to approximately 50% of invaded habitat with total successful eradication occurring only in the satellite populations.

Thlaspi arvens (Brassicaceae) can have either a summer or winter annual life history. To determine the relative frequencies of these two life history morphs in natural populations, we examined variation in the germination patterns of freshly ripened seeds both within and among five southern Min nesota populations. Seeds were collected when the siliques were dry but partially intact, and all seeds were collected within a six day period. Two replicates of 50 seeds from each maternal plant were planted in flats within 24 hours of collection and placed in the greenhouse. Germination was scored for 5 weeks, the flats were stratified at 5 C for three months, and post-stratification germination was scored. Total germination (fresh + strat ified) varied significantly both within and among populations; between 36% and 97% of the planted seeds germinated in each population. The per centage of total germination that occurred in fresh, unstratified seed ranged between 15% and 98% in the five populations (p&lt;O.OOl). At the population level, there was a strong positive relationship between the total number of germinated seeds and the proportion of those seeds that germlinated before stratification. Populations collected later in the season had lower overall germination, even though only mature siliques were collected and all pop ulations were collected within a six-day period. While over 50% of the observed variation was among populations, there was significant variation within populations for both germination characteristics. These results sug gest that the relative proportions of summer and winter annuals may differ among these populations, and that most populations will have at least some individuals of each life history morph. HENRY STEVENS, M. H. and 0. L. PETCHEY. Cook College, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 089801 USA. Relationships between di versity and stability depend on the cause of variation in diversity. Despite widespread interest, relationships between biodiversity and stability of ecological communities remain obscure. Here we present a novel mech anism, the "species pool effect", that causes stability to vary with species diversity. Our simulations show that more diverse comunities are more stable when species diversity varies among local communities because communities vary in total density. In contrast, more diverse communities are less stable when species diversity varies among local communities be cause local communities vary in dominance. Such disparate statistical ef fects of species diversity on stability arise from the constancy of the species pool: When communities repeatedly reflect the species pool, they appear stable; when communities do not consistently reflect the species pool, they are free to vary stochastically and therefore are not stable.

We used the Multiple-Element-Limitation (MEL) model to examine N and P limitation on C stocks at a tropical P-limited forest subsequently cleared of trees by harvest and fire. In mature tropical forest, vegetation demands for both N and P are supplied largely through the recycling of these ele ments within the ecosystem. Accumulation of N and P during forest ag gradation depends on supply rates from external sources (weathering, de position, and for N, biological fixation), the rates at which they are lost (occlusion, leaching, and volatilization), and the capacity of the ecosystem to entrain N and P into internal cycles. If the mature forest remains undis turbed the rates of N and P fluxes from the system will be proportional to their rates of supply from external sources. With disturbance, N and P losses accompany biomass death or removal, and proportional N losses often exceed those of P. Our simulations illustrated a recovery to pre disturbance C stocks in the model system that is constrained early by N and later by P availability. Mechanisms controlling this shift between N and P limitation included (1) differential losses of N and P through fire with early enhancements on P availability, (2) buffering of immediately available P pools (resin P) by labile P pools (bicarbonate, NaOH and dilute HC, extractable P), and (3) biological N fixation. Differential losses of dissolved organic N and P may also influence shifts between limiting el ements in a recovering system. When the model site was subjected to agricultural practices without fertilizer enhancements the early N limitation was absent. In this case the return to pre-disturbance C stocks was con strained largely by P due to depletion of the labile P buffer which supplies the pool of immediately available P In this scenario the long-term recovery was controlled by the limiting rate at which P could be supplied from outside the system.

Late season photosynthesis, chemistry and phenol ogy of sun and shade leaves of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) trees after two years of CO2 enrichment. The objective of this study was to determine whether elevated CO2 affected leaf senescence of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) trees at the Duke/Brookhaven FACE experiment. A change in late season leaf phenol ogy due to CO2 enrichment, either accelerating or retarding senescence, could substantially affect seasonal carbon gain by these trees. In this study, experimental plots have been fumigated with elevated CO2 (ambient plus 200 ml F1-) since August 1996. During September, October and November of 1998, we measured light-saturated photosynthesis and chlorophyll con tent on the youngest and oldest leaves of four sun and shade shoots from six trees per CO2 treatment. Older leaves had lower photosynthetic rates, chlorophyll content and senesced earlier than young leaves. Elevated CO2 enhanced net photosynthesis at growth CO2 concentration by 74% in the sun leaves and 35% in the shade leaves through the senescent period. The timing of decline of photosynthesis was not affected by CO2 enrichment. 118 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="80">Leaf chlorophyll content was not different between the elevated and am bient CO2 treatments at any time during the experiment. Elevated CO2 did not change the timing or rate of senescence in sun leaves.

In summary, we found very little CO2 induced change in late season leaf characteristics of sweetgum trees in the Duke FACE experiment. HESS, R. S.' and T A.

Changes in the distribution and amount of late suc cessional/old growth, hardwood and shrub cover types in the coast range of Oregon, 1939-1993. Characterizing the shifts over time in the distribution and amount of late successional/old growth, shrub, and hardwood cover types in the Oregon Coast Range is critical for many policy and ecological questions. However, existing estimates of change are based on source data that is too coarse to investigate the pertinent interactions of land use history and environment on vegetation patterns. Our objective was to assess the fine-scale changes in landcover and landcover distribution in the Coast Range of Oregon. We examined landcover across multiple ownerships from 1939 to 1993 using aerial photos and GIS. We delineated and interpreted 1500 20-meter plots for landcover on scanned, georeferenced aerial photos. We compared the distribution of landcover types in 1939 and 1993 to a suite of environmental variables, and to ownership. The number of large and very large conifer and mixed conifer plots declined by 63 percent, from 36% to 13% of all plots, during the 54-year period. Ownership of larger conifer stands shifted from private industrial to federal lands. Shrub and hardwood cover declined by 16 percent, from 31% to 25% of all plots. Shrub and hardwood plots occurred on lower slopes closer to streams in 1993. Younger mixed conifer and pure conifer stands showed the greatest expansion in cover, increasing by 210 percent, from 21% to 44% of all plots. Landowners in the Coast Range have altered the cover and distribution of vegetation in diverse ways, shifting the landscape to one dominated by young conifers, and shifting distribution of hardwood and older coniferous stands toward particular ownerships and site types.

Forest fragmentation represents a huge change in the biogeographic "con text" of forested systems, to which plant species are only now adjusting. Ecologists are concerned that species diversity will decline in fragmented systems because colonization of fragments will be insufficient to counteract ongoing local extinctions. This study examined the potential for tree species to colonize forest fragments in terms of their abilities to be dispersed to and establish seedlings in fragments lacking conspecifics. Seeds and seed lings of four native hardwoods, Carya cordiformis, Betula alleghaniensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Juglans nigra were experimentally introduced into forest fragments in the Long Point Region, Southern Ontario. Survivorship curves were constructed for each species for the period encompassing the post-dispersal seed stage, germination, through to the end of fourth year seedling establishment. The chance of the species' seed arriving in a frag ment from an extraneous seed source was indicated by empirical obser vations of inter-fragment dispersal in the study area. Results indicated that three of the four species had less than a 2 % chance of producing a fourth year seedling in a fragment due to high rates of rodent seed predation and low rates of germination and first year survival. All species had extremely low chances of seed dispersal to fragments located &gt;150 m from a seed source. Tree species thus face severe barriers to inter-fragment colonization as a result of both dispersal and establishment constraints. HILDERBRAND, R. H.'l and J. L. KERSHNER."12 ' Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84322-5210; 2USDA Forest Service Fish Ecology Unit. In dividuality in habitat selection by stream-resident cutthroat trout. Many habitat and foraging models presume that individuals of the same species and similar life history stage will select similar habitat when given the choice. In the absence of predators and intra- and interspecific com petition, we should expect central place foragers such as stream- dwelling trout to select the same specific sites, i.e., the "best" site in a stream section. We tested this hypothesis using cutthroat trout implanted with radio trans mitters in Beaver Creek, Idaho. We established 9 experimental stream sec tions by fencing off entire sections of stream 12-30 m long: 3 in high gradient (&gt;3% channel slope); 3 in low gradient (-1%); and 3 in beaver ponds. Prior to the experiments, all fish were removed from sections and then a single cutthroat trout (&gt;200 mm) containing a radio transmitter was introduced into each section and located hourly during daylight hours for a 3 day period. Each fish was used in four separate sections with four trials conducted in each section. In general, fish did not converge on the same habitats when habitat heterogeneity was high such as high gradient chan nels with numerous boulders and undercut banks. In contrast, nearly all individuals used the same sites in relatively simple habitats such as small beaver ponds. Site specific habitat models constructed for each section using logistic regression were poor predictors of where individuals would reside within a section. Our results suggest that habitat selection may be a highly individualized process when several choices are present. HILL, M. and H. CASWELL. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole MA 02543. The effects of habitat destruction in finite patch landscapes: A chain-binomial metapopulation model. We present a new stochastic model for metapopulations in landscapes with a finite but arbitrary number of patches. The model, similar in form to the chain-binomial epidemic model, can describe the effects of habitat destruc tion in finite patch landscapes. The model is an absorbing Markov chain (where extinction is the absorbing state), and includes a function describing the ability of propagules to search for suitable patches to colonize. We show how to calculate quasi-equilibrium patch occupancy frequencies (p), mean extinction times (r), and survival probabilities (1(t)) as a function of the number S of suitable patches. We found: (i) that habitat destruction can lead to short term increases in p when S is small, (ii) that increasing the searching ability of propagules increases the amount of habitat destruction the metapopulation can tolerate, (iii) that r is an exponential increasing function of S, and (iv) that l(t) declines rapidly from 1 to 0 over a small range of habitat destruction. Our results show that r and (1(t) are highly sensitive to changes in S. These measures provide a better assessment of metapopulation viability than patch occupancy frequencies.

Tree recruitment can be limited by dispersal, and distance- or density de pendent mortality. Each of these factors can foster the coexistence of tree species by affecting neighborhood competition. Distinguishing among these influences is difficult, because all operate when plants are small and diffi cult to study. We used a series of nested spatial models and an extensive data set to determine the relative effects of dispersal, distance- and density dependent mortality on tree species in the Southern Appalachians. At 100 one m2 quadrats located across five permanent vegetation plots, we col lected three years of seed rain and seed bank densities, and tagged seedlings as they emerged to determine seed germination and seedling survival. We used these data to determine whether seedling densities beyond the first year were most constrained by seed availability, distance to the nearest con-specific tree, or density of con-specific seedlings. We found that seed dispersal limited seed availability for all taxa, but that species (Betula spp., Acer rubrum) with both long average dispersal distances (&gt; 25 meters) and high adult tree abundances (basal area &gt; 4 m2/ha) were able to disperse seed to nearly all of our quadrats. Because of their longer than average dispersal distances, wind dispersed species tended to be less limited by dispersal than animal dispersed species were. More species were affected by distance-dependent mortality (5) than by density dependent mortality (2), implying that sibling competition at these life history stages is negli gible. An important exception was density dependent mortality of the an imal dispersed Quercus rubra and Quercus prinus between seed and seed ling stages, presumably due to seed predation. We argue that a better un derstanding of the mechanisms underlying both distance- and density-de pendent mortality will contribute to our knowledge of the forces that structure forest communities.

Known facts about the ecology of Myzus species in Iran in comparison to recent world investigations. There are seven or nine species of Myzus Passerini, 1860 in Iran. Subgen era of Nectarosiphon are represented by four to six names of the Myzus species group in Iran. The green peach aphid Myzus (Nectarosiphon) per sicae (Sulzer, 1776) is well adapted to various climatic conditions. In Khu zistan with hot dry summers and mild winters it is collected from over 50 host species from November to April. In April, alatae migrates to the cooler Zagros mountains. In these regions as well as in Tehran districts, they overwinter as nymphs on Asteracea or eggs on peach and almond. In very cool Alborz mountain regions they overwinter only in egg form on peach. Radiation in Myzus species is possibly the result of coevolution with their host plant as a result of environmental stress. Sources of stress may be abiotic or changes in secondary metabolite of their host plant. In IBP in vestigation M. persicae was abundant on potato in Europe while in Karaj (40 km south west Tehran) in 1970 the infestation was very low. The population of M. persicae on safflower in Ahwaz was higher on Nebrasca varieties and lower on local Arak variety. The alate record of winter Ahwaz popultion in yellow trap was surprisingly very high, specially in March.

Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA. Carbon cycling on the edge. Analyses of carbon dynamics at the landscape and regional scale usually do not consider spatial interactions. This is based on the notion that carbon dynamics can be modeled within patches that are then added up to predict landscape or broader scale dynamics (i.e., an additive approach). We re examined this assumption by first identifying the temporal and spatial scales where spatial interactions (the transfer of material from one place to another) strongly influence carbon dynamics. We then used a forest process model to estimate the effect of forest edges on processes (shading, mor tality, decomposition) that influence carbon cycling. We found that pro cesses that vary in a nonlinear manner across edges cause carbon dynamics at broader resolutions to depart from an additive estimate. Processes that vary in a linear manner across edges may be obvious at the scale of a forest stand, but become less evident at broader scales given that they tend to be averaged out. In addition to the way process rates change along edges, we found that landscape age structure and the disturbance regime control the degree edges influence carbon dynamics. At low and high elevation sites, shading effects and growth rates at edges increased carbon storage by 2 9% for the entire stand compared to stands with no edge effects. In contrast, carbon storage was reduced when mortality effects at edges were consid ered. Finally, we report how landscape metrics such as the fractal dimen sion might be used to estimate the effect of forest edges on carbon dynam ics at broad scales. HOFFMAN, L. L., N. P. R. ANTEN and D.

We studied how salinity levels and light availability influence the growth of mangrove seedlings. We grew two species of neo-tropical mangroves, Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle, in a multi-factorial green house experiment with three salinity levels (7, 23, 55 ppt NaCl) and four light levels (5, 12, 25, 50% photosynthetically active radiation, PAR). Plants of both species growing at low light did not exhibit significant dif ferences in whole plant biomass at different salinity levels. The negative effects of high salinity on whole plant growth became apparent only at higher light levels. Specifically, in R. mangle at low salinity, light avail ability and growth were positively related. At high salinity, increasing the light availability had no effect on plant growth. However, at medium sa linity, there was an intermediate optimum with the most growth at 25% PAR. In A. germinans, growth was positively related to light availability at both low and medium salinity, but at high salinity, increasing light avail ability did not increase growth. In general, root/leaf area increased with increasing salinity and with increasing light availability. At a given light level, plants at high salinity had less transpiration/root mass and transpi ration/leaf area than low salinity plants. At a given salinity level, the higher light plants transpired less per unit root mass but slightly more per unit leaf area than low light plants. These results suggest that the salinity level at which a seedling grows affects its ability to utilize light for growth. Field studies seeking to understand mangrove forest dynamics and patterns of seedling regeneration should consider both salinity levels and light avail ability and the interactions between these two factors. HOLDER, M. L. and P. D. TAYLOR. Acadia University, Wolfville, NS, Canada. The effect of landscape structure on peatland dragonflies and damselflies. We examined the effects of landscape structure on dragonflies and dam selflies (Insecta: Odonata) living in peatland habitat in western Newfound land. Using a nested spatial design, two separate comparisons of landscape composition were made. In one comparison, the amount of peatland was varied (&lt;20%, 25-45% or 50-70%) while the surrounding habitat type was held constant. In the other comparison the amount of peatland was held constant while the surrounding habitat types differed (forest, scrub or clearcut). Larval populations were sampled and habitat characteristics were measured at discrete pools within each study area. Adult emergence was measured by counting exuviae (shed larval skins) present at each study pool, while adult odonates were surveyed along transects. No significant difference in larval population size or structure was noted in the compar ison of landscapes differing in amount of peatland. Analyses indicate pools in peatland surrounded by forest had significantly fewer larvae (7.7 larvae/ sample, p=0.018) than pools in bogs surrounded by other matrix types (clearcut = 32.9 larvae/sample, scrub = 45.7 larvae/sample). However, this was related to pool pH, which also differed significantly between matrix treatments (p=0.039). Age structure of larval populations for at least the two most abundant odonate species showed no significant trend between landscape treatments. Present results show there may be minimal direct effect of landscape structure on peatland odonate populations. However, the influence of landscape structure on pool pH may indirectly affect odo nates. HOLYOAK, M. and M. J. DONAHUE. University of California, Davis CA 95616 USA. Migration, nutrient transport, and dynamics in source sink metapopulations. Two branches of ecological theory address population dynamics in habitat patches that vary in the amounts of resources they contain. Source-sink theory predicts that births will exceed deaths for source populations with abundant resources, leading to a net production of emigrants, whilst sink populations typically have fewer resources and are net receivers of immi grants. By contrast a model of "balanced dispersal" predicts that patches will produce a net number of emigrants which is inversely related to the carrying capacity of the donor patch. We tested the appropriateness of these models for describing the long-term dynamics and net movement within replicated microcosms containing a food chain consisting of decaying seeds, bacteria and a ciliated protist, Colpidium striatum. Both the rates of decline of C. striatum populations and rates of decomposition of seed re sources were strongly influenced by the amount of between-patch migration that was possible. Experimental estimates of the amount of between-patch movement of C. striatum broadly supported the balanced dispersal model. However, there were complex feedbacks between movement rate and with in-patch dynamics that are not predicted by this model. Isolated patches were used to establish a relationship between protist body size and nutrient (seed) level. Estimates of protist body size within connected patches then provided evidence that migrating organisms moved nutrients with them. Net movements of individuals between patches did not predict either the amount or the direction of net fluxes of protist biomass, which were also influenced by the body size and density of migrating individuals. The re sults show the importance of studying who is migrating, when individuals differ, if we are to understand source-sink inversions and the subsidy of ecosystems by transport of materials and energy by migrating individuals. 120 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="82">HOOD, J.

Although fish are often abundant and sometimes have strong top-down effects in streams, little is known about their role in stream nutrient cycles. We examined the importance of nitrogen and phosphorus excretion by two epibenthic grazing armored catfish Ancistrus triradiatus and Cheatostoma milesi in a nitrogen-limited neotropical stream, Rio Las Marias. The roles of these catfish species as nutrient regenerators were evaluated by com paring nutrients supplied by fish with algal nutrient demand. We developed a bioenergetics model to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus excretion rates of A. triradiatus and C. milesi. Daily nitrogen and phosphorus excretion rates were combined with estimates of A. triradiatus and C. milesi popu lation densities in order to estimate nutrient supply by fish on an areal basis. We estimated algal nutrient demand by measuring carbon fixation and C:N:P stoichiometry of algae. Our preliminary results suggest that A. triradiatus and C. milesi each supply 8% of algal nitrogen demand and 13% of phosphorus demand. Rio Las Marias contains several other abun dant species of fish that may significantly contribute to the stream's nutrient dynamics. Consequently, in a nitrogen-limited stream, such as Rio Las Marias, fish may help maintain high algal standing stocks. These results suggest the density and distribution of these armored catfish species may have important ecosystem-wide effects potentially including: Increased nu trient availability in areas with high fish densities, changes in algal species composition, or enhanced ecosystem stability. HOOFTMAN, D., R. BILLETER and M. DIEMER. Universitaet Zuerich, Switzerland. Effects of isolation on demographical behavior and growth of dominant plant species in wet calcareous grasslands in Switzerland. Habitat fragmentation may cause plant species in small and isolated habitat fragments to suffer from inbreeding depression and genetic drift, which negatively effects plant population fitness. Populations with reduced fitness cannot easily respond to a changing environment and stochastic effect, and thus have a higher risk of extinction. Most studies done on this subject have found these negative effects for rare species in relation to small pop ulation size; contrary, here we focus on abundant species. As shown in recent modelling these species could be the first to suffer extinction. If so, ecosystem functioning and persistence of rare plant and animal species could be impaired. In this study, the demographic behavior of populations and growth of individual plants of three dominant species is measured in small habitat islands with, assumed absence and sporadic presence of gene flow. We use a hierarchical spatial field design, consisting of large habitat islands with adjacent and remote small islands. In general, we find that the more isolated habitat islands, lacking gene flow, containing a more senile population structure, consisting of smaller proportions of younger plants, compared to less isolated and large habitat islands. However, also the pop ulation size has a strong elucidating value. We discuss that spatial distance between plant populations is indeed an important factor, by the possibility of counteracting inbreeding effects by sporadic gene flow into small frag ments close to large habitat islands. In addition, we discuss the impact of other effects, such as an increased influx of nutrient in isolated small habitat islands, following the "edge-habitat" principle. HOOKER, T D.' and J. E.

Forest ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage after agricultural abandonment. Forests of the northeastern US are expected to serve as a substantial sink for atmospheric carbon and nitrogen, yet questions remain about the rate and distribution of sequestered C and N within these ecosystems after ag ricultural abandonment. To examine the change in ecosystem C and N pools during the first 114 years of ecosystem recovery in southern New England, we developed a chronosequence of ten previously cultivated sites with sim ilar soils, land-use history and overstory vegetation (Pinus strobus). Total ecosystem C, including plant biomass, forest floor and soil to 70 cm, was significantly related to site age (r2 =0.92), while ecosystem N content did not change over time. Ecosystem C increased at an average rate of 2.05 Mg C ha-' yr-. Most of the sequestered C went into the plant biomass (73 %) and forest floor (17 %); the 20-70 cm soil depth (6 %) also increased significantly over the chronosequence. There was no significant change in ecosystem N content across the chronosequence (3.32 kg N ha-' yr-', P = 0.39); rather, N was re-allocated within the system. Nitrogen strongly de creased within the former plow layer (0-20 cm depth; -13.99 kg N ha-' yr '), and was offset by increases in the plant biomass (4.13 kg N ha-' yr') and forest floor (11.62 kg N ha-' yr'). Organic matter C:N ratios increased with time in plant and mineral soil pools, resulting in an increase C:N from 15 to approximately 50 in all measured ecosystem pools. The lack of a significant increase in ecosystem N over 100 years of succession suggests that recovering ecosystems may be functioning closer to steady state rather than as a substantial net sink for N. While the patterns of C accumulation are similar to other estimates from northeastern forests, we present the novel finding of substantial C storage below the former plow layer during forest development (0.13 Mg C ha-' yr' in the 20-70 cm soil depths).

Effects of diversity on the invasibility of plant communities in California serpentine grassland. More diverse communities are hypothesized to be more difficult for species to invade because greater species richness should leave less available re sources for a potential invader to exploit. In this experiment, we addressed three fundamental questions: 1) Does plant diversity influence invasibility of communities? 2) Do functional attributes of invaders related to resource acquisition influence the success of their invasion? and, 3) Is there a greater probability of invasion success when the invader differs from community members in functional attributes related to resource capture? Using already established experimental communities in California serpentine grassland, the experimental design allowed separation of effects due to differences in plant composition (which functional groups are present) from effects due to differences in functional group richness (how many groups are present). These experimental communities allowed control of several factors, in cluding disturbance regime, soil fertility, and community history, which confound attempts to study these questions a posteriori in already-invaded ecosystems. The experimental communities consisted of combinations of four functional groups: early season (E) and late season (L) annual forbs, perennial bunchgrasses and nitrogen-fixers. Replicated plots were estab lished in 1992 and have been maintained since. Invaders were seeded into experimental communities in known amounts, using several species from each of two functional groups (E and L; 6 species total). We measured abundance and biomass of invaders after the first year of introduction, in addition to resource parameters potentially relevant to invasion success (nitrogen, phosphorus, water and light availability). While success of some invading species decreased with increasing community diversity, overall invader success depended on interactions among initial community diver sity, the functional type of the invaders relative to the functional types of species already present in the community, and the relative competitive abil ities of invaders for limiting resources. These results suggest that there are not simple relationships between invasibility and species diversity, but that the functional characteristics of the species involved are equally important. HOOPES, M. F University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. The role of low quality habitat in perennial plant population dynamics. Because of the current rate of habitat conversion, it is critical to understand how changes in habitat quality and quantity affect the population dynamics of rare or target species. Using analytical and simulation models I assess the population dynamical effects of adding low quality (sink) habitat or converting higher quality (but not necessarily "source") habitat to aink hab itat. Source-sink models incorporating passive dispersal demonstrate that converting uninhabitable areas into low quality habitat always increases the fitness of the total population even if lambda in the superior habitat is not greater than 1. Converting a portion of better habitat to sink habitat, how ever, decreases overall fitness except in simulations when sinks became transient sources or have extremely inflated fecundities. These combined results suggest that sinks may play important roles in plant population dynamics, particularly in variable environments and for long-lived species, for which the maternal environment will often be inhospitable to seeds and seedlings. Passive dispersal allows plant species to move with climate and Oral Presentation Abstracts 121</page><page sequence="83">successional changes, and occasional increased fecundity or emergence may buffer periods of zero recruitment. Relaxation of the fitness criteria in superior habitats demonstrates that source-sink dynamics can play a role in conservation situations even when no extant population is increasing. HOOVER, C. M., R. A. BIRDSEY and L. S. HEATH. USDA Forest Sev ice, Newtown Square, PA, USA. Constructing standing carbon budgets for individual forests: Can forest inventory and analysis data provide a shortcut? The Kyoto Protocol permits the use of forested lands as carbon sinks for the purposes of constructing national carbon budgets. This has led to in creased interest in developing carbon budgets for US forest lands. Often, these efforts are hampered by the lack of detailed forest inventory data. We tested the feasibility of using data from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program to estimate forest composition and standing carbon. Two forests of different acreages (approx. 53,000 and 38,000 acres) were tested, and the results compared to the actual forest inventory data. FIA data failed to accurately represent age class distribu tion, forest composition, and standing carbon in both cases. There were no systematic differences; in one case FIA data overestimated standing carbon by 23%, but forest composition projections were fairly accurate. In the other forest, carbon was underestimated by only 6%, but age class and forest composition projections were inaccurate. Based on this analysis, FIA data should not be used to develop carbon budgets for smaller forests (forests over 53,000 acres have not yet been tested). HORTON, J. L., S. C. HART and T. E. KOLB. Northern Arizona Univer sity, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5018. Depth to ground water affects riparian tree water uptake and physiological condition. In order to effectively manage riparian ecosystems, it is important to un derstand the water requirements of native riparian tree species. We inves tigated water uptake and physiological condition of two native species, Populus fremontii and Salix gooddingii, and one invasive exotic species, Tamarix chinensis, along the unregulated Hassayampa River in Arizona. We established seven transects along a gradient of surface flow and depth to ground water. Depth to ground water and soil water content were mon itored during both the 1997 and 1998 growing seasons. Leaf gas exchange, A 13C, water potential, and canopy condition were measured on all species in both years. Source and xylem waters were collected for stable isotope analysis to determine plant water sources. Ground water was deep and highly variable in the ephemeral reach in 1997. Predawn water potential decreased with increasing depth to ground water for both native species, but not for Tamarix in 1997. Preliminary stable isotope analysis of eco system water sources suggests a shift in water uptake sources as depth to ground water increased in all species. This shift was associated with de creased leaf gas exchange and twig xylem water potential, and increased in canopy dieback in the native species, but not in Tamarix. In contrast, ground water was shallower and more constant in 1998 than in 1997, due to the occurrence of a strong El Nino event. Predawn water potential was unrelated to depth to ground water for all three species, and there was no apparent change in water uptake sources for any species over the narrow range of depth to ground water observed in 1998. In addition all species had higher rates of leaf gas exchange, greater branch elongation, and lower canopy dieback in 1998 than in 1997. HOULTON, B. Z., I C. T DRISCOLLI and T J.

The effect of ice storm damage on drainage water chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest-Linking natural disturbance to nutrient loss and acidification of drainage water. The Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) experienced a severe ice storm on January 7-9, 1998, resulting in massive forest crown loss within experimental watersheds. The most substantial (50%-60%) crown damage occurred at the elevation zone of 650-750 meters. Past studies on ice storms have focused on classifying species susceptibility to crown loss and! or succession following the disturbance event, neglecting the effects on biogeochemical cycles. Thus, our objective was to investigate the impact of the disturbance on the spatial and temporal patterns in soil water and stream water chemistry of watershed l(WI) and watershed 6 (W6) of HBEE We utilized historical data on drainage water chemistry (concentra tions and fluxes) collected for WI and W6 prior to the disturbance to assess the biogeochemical response of the watersheds to the ice storm event. Dur ing and subsequent to the 1998-growing season, a marked increase in soil water and stream water nitrate and decreases in acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and sulfate were observed. The peak concentration of nitrate in the stream water of WI (170 VLmol/L) occurring in August 1998 represented the highest nitrate concentration measured for this undisturbed watershed since longitudinal monitoring began in 1991. Nitrate showed a strong in verse correlation to both ANC and sulfate, which suggests cascading con trols of nitrate loss on nutrient dynamics and the acid-base status of stream water. Hydrologic flow paths within the watersheds (depending on the crown damage zone in which the flow path resided) controlled the temporal pattern of stream chemistry at different sites longitudinally within the wa tershed. Decreased vegetative uptake and loss of biotic regulation over nutrient cycling were mainly responsible for the loss of nutrients to waters draining the forested watersheds. A delay between the ice storm and the initial drainage water chemistry response was also observed. This delay was likely a result of the N mineralization maximum exceeding biotic up take/requirements during the latter part of the growing season (ca. August). Ultimately, the disturbance associated with the ice storm resulted in the acidification of stream water, which altered the long-term pattern of in creases in stream water ANC. HOUSER, J. N.,' C. E.

Long-term effects of a short-term lake food web manipulation: Tues day Lake 12 years later. A temporary, whole-lake food web manipulation that was within the scale of natural events (e.g. a fish winterkill) had effects lasting at least 12 years. In 1985, Tuesday Lake was subject to a strong food web manipulation: 90% of the planktivorous minnow population was removed, and piscivo rous adult largemouth were added to the lake. The lower levels of the food web rapidly responded to the this switch from planktivore to piscivore dominance. Zooplankton mean size increased from 0.47 to 0.68 mm, Chao borus biomass increased from 2.5 to 4.5 g/m2, and chlorophyll a decreased from 11.6 to 5.4 ug/L. Significantly, the abundance of the dominant di noflagellate, Peridinium limbatum, was greatly reduced during the manip ulation, and it eventually disappeared from the lake. By the spring of 1987, the food web was restored to its premanipulation configuration. All large mouth bass were removed and the lake was restocked with minnows. Since the restoration of planktivore dominance in the lake in 1987, minnow bio mass has risen to 49 kg/ha, substantially higher than the premanipulation minnow biomass of 24 kg/ha. The high biomass of minnows maintains a zooplankton biomass lower than premanipulation levels. However, chlo rophyll a still remains low (4.1 ug/L), and Peridinium limbatum has not returned. Thus, 12 years after the restoration of a manipulated component of an ecosystem, the system remains in a state that is different from both premanipulation conditions and conditions during the manipulation sug gesting that the recovery of ecosystems, even from brief manipulations, is a complex process.

The differ ential influence of site and soil characteristics on invasibility of forest communities. While some forest communities in southeastern New York show very high levels of invasion, others appear to resist the influx of alien woody species. To explore the role that soil and forest types play in determining why some communities are more susceptible to invasive species than others, we con ducted a reciprocal soil transplant experiment. We planted seedlings of five alien (Acer platanoides, Celastrus orbiculatus, Eleaegnus umbellata, Lon icera japonica and Rosa multiflora) and three native species (Acer rubrum, Pinus rigida and Quercus coccinea) in pots with soils from mesic sites of low invasion (ML), mesic sites of high invasion (MH), and dry sites of low invasion (DL) and then reciprocally transplanted these pots in each location. A total of 1438 individuals were planted in five each of ML, MH 122 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="84">and DL sites (n= 15 sites). After three months of growth, sizes of invaders and natives did not differ among ML and MH sites and soils, suggesting that invasion into currently uninvaded mesic forest communities was not restricted by unique site or soil characteristics. Thus, invasion into ML communities is likely dispersal limited. Invasives grew proportionally more than natives in MH soils than in DL soils (significant invader by growth interaction on MH and DL subset, ANOVA, F=5.73, ldf, p&lt;0.05) sug gesting some soil types may provide invaders with an advantage over na tives. In contrast to results involving soils, invasives and natives did not differ in their interaction with MH and DL sites, suggesting that other site characteristics (e.g. light) may be less important for relative invader suc cess. These results indicate that at a landscape scale, soil properties may have a larger influence on community invasibility than other site-specific community characteristics. HOWE, H.

Meadow voles, IMicrotus pennsylvanicus 320/ha, admitted to 16-species synthetic tallgrass assemblages 26 months after planting in southwestern Wisconsin reduced standing plant biomass 53% over controls within 10 weeks (F1,33 = 4.105, P = 0.05), with a selective reduction of tick-treefoil, Desmodium canadense, densities by 50% over plots protected from voles (F,50 = 5.185, P &lt; 0.05). Because this nitrogen-fixing legume differentially invaded exclosures with nitrogen-deficient soil (1333-2968 ppm; regres sion of legume density on soil nitrogen: F1 16 = 15.392, P &lt; 0.001), sup pression by vole herbivory and anticipated granivory should result in an advantage to unpalatable plants that are competitive on nitrogen-deficient soils, leading to successional divergence in plantings to which rodents are admitted as compared with those from which they are excluded.

Twelve months after rodent admission to plots, legumes remain suppressed and rye decimated by late summer.

Com petitive effects of an introduced species, Hieracium aurantiacum, on a native congener. Many introduced species invade areas that are already inhabited by a close ly related congener. While these species share many traits in common, the invader often possesses a unique trait or combination of traits that enables it to successfully establish and persist in its new range. I have used a congener comparison approach to elucidate the mechanisms of invasion success for Hieracium aurantiacum at the expense of the native Hieracium longipilum at Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota. Results of a previous study showed that H. aurantiacum incurs significantly less dam age from herbivory and disease than H. longipilum does, indicating that it is aided by freedom from natural enemies in its areas of invasion. To de termine whether these species compete for resources in the absence of natural enemies, I performed a greenhouse competition experiment using a de Wit replacement series design. The two species were planted both together and separately in densities of 2, 4, 8, and 12 plants per pot. After three months, plants were harvested, dried, and weighed. Both total density of plants and proportion of H. aurantiacum in a pot had a significant effect on H. longipilum biomass. H. longipilum plants were smaller when sur rounded by H. aurantiacum individuals, especially in high density pots. The alien, H. aurantiacum, grew more quickly than H. longipilum and produced more leaves allowing it to shade out the native species. This study suggests that interspecific competition may play a significant role in the establishment of invaders. HRABIK, T. R., B. K. GREENHIELD, T. K. KRATZ, D. LEWIS, A. I. POLLARD and K. A.

Variability in species richness among four tax onomic groups in north temperate lakes with varying chemical char acteristics and stream connectivity. We evaluated variability in species richness of macrophytes, benthic in vertebrates, snails, and fish across 32 north temperate lakes as a function of chemical characteristics and the extent of connection to other lakes via streams. Chemical characteristics, such as specific conductance, vary as a function of surface and ground water flow and may influence biotic con stituents. Stream connections may represent corridors for colonization or invasion of species located in adjoining lakes thereby influencing species richness in the associated lakes. We hypothesized that stream connections would positively influence species richness. Species richness within each of the four taxonomic groups was significantly positively correlated to spe cific conductance. Lakes with low ionic strength and no stream connections had the lowest species richness among taxa. Lakes having stream connec tions and high ionic strength had the highest richness levels across all taxanomic groups. Lakes with either high ionic strength or stream connec tions, but not both, had intermediate species richness. Lakes with high ionic strength and no stream connections had significantly higher number of species in three of four taxonomic groups than lakes with stream connec tions and low ionic strength. Our results suggest that extinction forces may override increases in species exchange associated with stream connections between lakes, and that chemical characteristics of lakes may be a stronger determinant of extinction rates in north-temperate lakes.

Stomatal conductance and photosyn thesis are directly related to stem hydraulic conductivity in ponderosa pine seedlings. Plants regulate CO2 uptake and transpirational water loss through changes in stomatal conductance. Recent work has shown that stomata are respon sive to changes in the hydraulic conductivity of the soil to leaf pathway. However, there are no studies that have defined the response surface of this relationship and results from field studies can be complicated by changes in relative humidity and or light. We tested the hypothesis that changes in stem hydraulic conductivity (k) directly affect stomatal conductance and measured the response surface of k and leaf gas exchange. We systemati cally reduced k of six ponderosa pine seedlings using an air injection tech nique to induce cavitation and measured the response of leaf gas exchange in the laboratory under constant light and humidity. We found that stomatal conductance, transpiration and assimilation all declined linearly with de creasing k (R2 = 0.58, 0.59, and 0.53 respectively) and that this response was independent of bulk leaf water potential. These results suggest: 1) stomatal conductance can respond directly to changes in k and that this response is linear, 2) The regulation of constant bulk leaf water potential via stomatal control of transpiration was responsible for the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and stomatal conductance, 3) changes in whole plant conductance may affect carbon gain.

Plant stress has been traditionally viewed as a strong force underlying the population dynamics of herbivorous insects. Previously, we conducted lab oratory experiments to determine the impact of salt-stressed plants on an assemblage of saltmarsh-inhabiting herbivorous insects, mostly planthop pers and leafhoppers. The results of these studies suggest there is no gen eralized response governing the performance of insects on stressed host plants; even congeners show divergent responses. Thereafter, we conducted a survey of low- and high-salinity marshes to determine if naturally-oc curring salt stress in the field would elicit similar herbivore responses found in the laboratory studies. We sampled 16 saltmarshes along the Chesapeake Bay and 4 Atlantic coastal marshes to span the range of desired salinities. To a great extent, results of the field survey corresponded to laboratory findings. Species which responded adversely to salt stress in the laboratory (e.g. Prokelisia dolus) occurred more abundantly on low-salinity marshes, and species that were positively affected by salt-stressed plants in the lab (e.g. Prokelisia marginata) occurred more commonly on the saline marsh es. Both our field and laboratory data cast doubt on the plant-stress hy pothesis as a general explanation for the outbreak dynamics of herbivorous insects.

Because management strategies for species with multiple populations de pend on the degree to which population densities are affected by migration between populations vs local conditions there is a pressing need in con servation biology for well developed theory about when migration is ex pected to affect population dynamics. Previous studies of metapopulations of the aphid, Aphis lugentis suggest that the strength of predator prey in teractions, local population growth rates and the number of suitable habitat patches within a metapopulation play important roles in determining the effect of migration on population dynamics. Using a simulation model of aphid metapopulation dynamics parameterized from field observations and experiments I tested how variation in the strength of predator-prey inter actions, population growth rates and number of suitable habitat patches changed the effect of migration on population dynamics. I found that the importance of migration decreased when predator-prey interactions were very strong, increased when population growth rates were very low or very high, and decreased when their were fewer patches of suitable habitat in a metapopulation.

Ecosys tem-level impacts of mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) encroachment on C and N pools of herbaceous vegetation and soils in a temperate sa vanna. Mesquite, a nitrogen-fixing tree species, has expanded across substantial portions of North Texas rangelands during the past 100 years. This long term expansion is representative of woody encroachment occurring across arid and semiarid systems worldwide, and is a phenomenon which has the capacity to subsantially alter C and N storage. Our research quantified the dynamics of herbaceous and soil C and N pools in response to varying levels of mesquite biomass in North Texas (i.e., among a series of study sites where aboveground mesquite biomass ranged from 3,000 kg/ha to 42,000 kg/ha). While aboveground C and N pools in mesquite biomass increased by 14 times along this gradient, C and N pools in aboveground herbaceous biomass (i.e., standing live, standing dead, and litter) doubled along the gradient (from 1560 to 3358 kg C/ha and from 49 to 101 kg N/ ha), and C and N pools in surface soils (0-10 cm depth) increased by only 33% and 45%, respectively. Annual accumulation rates of C and N in herbaceous biomass (i.e., standing live and standing dead at peak biomass) were 6 times greater than accumulations in mesquite biomass at the low end of the range in mesquite biomass, but were only 9 and 12% of accu mulations in mesquite at the high end of the range. Combined pools of C and N (i.e., aboveground mesquite, aboveground herbaceous, and surface soils) ranged from 1618 to 2496 kg N/ha and from 18926 to 42254 kg C/ ha across the series of study sites. Surface soils dominated N pools across the sites, accounting for between 77 and 94% of the combined N pools. In contrast, soils accounted for between 48 and 83% of combined C pools. Mesquite accounted for 8 to 47% of combined C pools, and herbaceous biomass accounted for between 4 and 15% of those pools. At the individual tree scale, mesquite influenced C and N pools in both surface soils and herbaceous biomass. Surface soil C and N pools were 14 and 12% greater, respectively, at points under mesquite canopies compared to those away from mesquite canopies. Similarly, C and N concentrations were signifi cantly higher in herbaceous tissue sampled under versus away from mes quite canopies, and C and N mass in herbaceous biomass was a much as 18% higher under versus away from mesquite canopies.

The effects of elevated CO2 on nitrogen cycling in a scrub oak ecosystem: An integrated study using a long term '5N tracer. We previously reported that elevated CO2 increased nitrogen (N) fixation and decreased soil N mineralization in a scrub-oak ecosystem, changes in the N cycle that represent positive and negative feedbacks (respectively) to increased plant growth. These results reflect a general problem in our cur rent understanding of the effects of elevated CO2 on N cycling, where past short-term studies have identified a broad suite of possible changes in N cycling in response to elevated CO2, but have been less useful in assessing integrative effects, for example, whether net feedbacks to plant growth are positive or negative. To address this, we began a long-term '5N labeling experiment in the Florida scrub-oak system in June of 1998. Results to date show a sustained increase in N fixation and above-ground N uptake in response to elevated CO2, with little change in microbial 15N content. These results suggest that changes in nitrogen cycling may represent a positive feedback to plant growth in response to elevated CO2. HUNT, T and B. BLOSSEY. Cornell University, Ithaca NY 14853 USA. Above and below ground herbivory in purple loosestrife: Using gas exchange and biomass allocation to assess plant compensation and sus ceptibility to herbivores. Plant compensation for herbivore damage can involve alteration of biomass allocation patterns, and increased carbon fixation rate in leaves. We inves tigated how purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) biomass allocation and gas exchange were affected by leaf (Galerucella calmariensis), and root herbivores (Hylobius transversovittatus). Plants were subjected to three lev els of root and leaf herbivory in a fully factorial design to examine the potential interactive effect between these two herbivores. To assess how purple loosestrife responds to herbivory, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and internal leaf C02 levels were measured under conditions of low and high light. Plants were harvested at the end of the experiment to determine final biomass allocation patterns. Leaf herbivory under these two light conditions resulted in lower net photosynthetic rates, and higher internal leaf CO2 levels with increasing leaf damage. This indicated that damaged leaves were stressed and unable to fix all available carbon. In creasing leaf herbivory did not affect allocation of biomass to leaves, al though stem biomass was reduced. While plants may increase allocation to leaves to compensate for leaf herbivory, lower net photosynthetic rates significantly reduces total carbon inputs to damaged plants. In contrast to leaf herbivores, root herbivory increased net photosynthetic rates under low light conditions, suggesting that root herbivore-damaged plants were more efficient at fixing carbon under these conditions. Under higher light levels, however, carbon fixation rates did not differ between root herbivory treat ments. There was also no effect of root herbivory on biomass allocation patterns, though this may have been due to low numbers of root feeders in the roots. No evidence was found of an interaction between leaf and root herbivores in terms of either plant gas exchange or biomass allocation. While changes in plant biomass allocation in response to herbivory are often investigated in insect-plant interactions, this study indicates that her bivore-induced changes in net photosynthetic rate should also be consid ered as a important component of the plastic ability of plants to compensate for herbivory.

The influence of present-day levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on growth and the production of UV-absorbing compounds was examined in a field study of two Southern Hemisphere, evergreen trees, Mountain Beech (Nothofagus solandri var clifforioides) and Kanuka (Kunzia ericoides). In tact branches of naturally occurring trees were suspended below UV-B (280-320 nm) transmitting and absorbing plastics. Measurements of UV dose were amde continuously, plant growth, and UV absorbing compounds were made at approximately monthly intervals from bud-burst until senes cence (14 months later). The daily erythemally effective UV dose ranged from 6.5 in summer to 0.5 kJ in-2 d-l in winter, with a total leaf life-time dose of approximately 1000 kJ in-2. Bud-burst in both species occurred near the time of maximum daily UV dose. In the presence of UV-B radi ation, the concentration of UV-absorbing compounds (A300 cm-2) were greater in leaves exposed to the ambient UV dose. Seasonal changes in UV-absorbing compounds of beech leaves were more dynamic than in ka nuka. The young leaves of both species started with high levels of UV absorbing compounds (beech = 3.9, kanuka = 2.6). In both species, UV absorbing compounds fell to a low in late winter and then rose again in 124 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="86">response to the increasing UV dose. For the same dose of UV, young leaves produce more UV-absorbing compounds than older leaves, suggesting a decline in investment as leaves age. In beech, the ambient dose of UV retarded shoot extension (-43 %) and the number of new leaves produced in the 2nd year (-45%) after treatment commenced. The number of sec ondary twigs formed was also reduced (-51%). Apical dominance was en hanced by ambient levels of UV. HUSTON, M. A., D. A. WARDLE2 and J.

Saving biodiversity: Can ecosys tem function justify species conservation? All citizens, and certainly all scientists, should be concerned about the high rate of species extinctions and the continuing degradation of the Earth's ecosystems. On the premise that the role of science in public policy should be to identify problems, objectively prioritize them on the basis of their impacts, and suggest solutions, we review the accumulating body of evi dence related to the ecosystem function of species diversity, which has emerged as one of the primary justifications for the importance of preserv ing biodiversity. Major issues we address include: 1) reasons for apparent inconsistencies between experimental results and observations of diversity productivity patterns in natural systems; 2) observed patterns and ecosys tem impacts of historical extinctions; 3) assumptions of alternative exper imental designs used to address this issue; 4) analyses and data required to identify ecosystem consequences of changes in species diversity; and 5) a tentative ranking of environmental problems related to ecosystem func tion and suggested solutions. We conclude that experimental evidence pub lished to date does not indicate that high diversity ecosystems necessarily function better than lower diversity ecosystems. However, there is strong evidence for the important role of individual species and for positive in teractions between species, particularly at very low levels of species rich ness. An emphasis on preserving a full complement of species at landscape and regional scales may be the most effective approach to maintaining the function of high and low diversity ecosystems alike, as well as for pre serving species with no demonstrable effect on ecosystem function..

Relationships among porcupines, pinyon pines, and bark beetles in the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the Edwards Plateau in Texas. Understanding linkages among different trophic levels is important to the conservation and management of ecosystems. The goal of this research was to test the hypothesis that porcupines, (Erethizon dorsatum), predispose the papershell pinyon pine, (Pinus remota), a Pleistocene-relict species, to col onization by pine engraver beetles of the genus Ips. We studied porcupine ecology, pinyon pine physiology and physiognamy, and beetle-pine asso ciations on a study area in the southwestern Edwards Plateau from June 1997 through August 1999 to elucidate relationships among these 3 organ isms. Porcupines were primarily located in pinyon pines. Pines damaged by porcupines were greater in girth (P &lt; 0.006), taller (P &lt; 0.001) and had greater resin flow rates (P &lt; 0.001) than paired undamaged trees (n = 183 pairs on 20 transects). The distribution of bark beetle infestations varied (P &lt; 0.01) between damaged and undamaged trees. Although at tacks by beetles were evident on both types of trees, successful colonization was greater on pines damaged by porcupines. Intensity of porcupine attack, indexed by number of feeding scars and amount of bark removed, was also associated with greater colonization rates by beetles. Our data on these interspecific relationships are of regional interest relative to conservation of this unique pinyon-juniper woodland, and of wider value as a model system showing the role of distinct phyla that define community structure in forest and woodland ecosystems.

There is presently much interest in the effects of individual plant species on soil microbial communities, and understanding how these interactions feedback in terms of above-ground productivity and plant community struc ture. The aim of this study was to examine how individual plant species (Lolium perenne, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Holcus lanatus, Achillea mil lefolium, Trifolium pratense, Plantago lanceolata), which dominate the flo ra of UK herb rich haymeadows, influenced soil biota and competitive interactions between plants. Using microcosms, plant species effects on two soils of differing soil N status were investigated through a range of plant (shoot and root biomass ratios) and microbial (microbial biomass carbon, activity and community structure)measurements. Results showed that plant species significantly affected soil microbial biomass C and activity at both N levels. Results were expressed as percentage difference relative to bare soil. Lolium perenne, a dominant grass of high fertility grasslands nega tively affected microbial biomass C and activity in the low N soil (-14 and -1% respectively). Holcus lanatus, a grass of intermediate fertility grass lands, positively (+24%) and negatively (-9%) affected microbial biomass c in the high and low N soils respectively. This species showed positive effects on microbial activity in both soils (11.5% low N and 5.4% high N). Anthoxanthum odoratum also exhibited postive (+16.2%) and negative ( 12.6%) effects on microbial biomass C in the high and low N soils re spectively. The three dicot species negatively affected microbial biomass C and activity in the two soils. This study shows that there are significant plant species effects on the soil microbial biomass at different N levels. Such plant species effects have important implications for plant community structure and nutrient cycling through competitive feedback effects. INNIS, S. A., ' K. H. ROGERS2 and R. J. NAIMAN.'

Spatial and temporal aspects of water use across the riparian-upalnd gradient in a southern African savanna landscape. Riparian systems within the savanna landscape of southern Africa are sub ject to particularly strong biophysical gradients, which vary in nature and intensity between the monsoonal seasonal cycles of hot wet summers and warm dry winters. Water is thought to be a strong driving factor in these systems; therefore, we investigated water use across the riparian-upland gradient using several species of trees with overlapping but distinct distri butions in the landscape. Using natural abundance ratios of deuterium (d D) we show that water utilization is subject to shifts both spatially across the riparian-upland gradient as well as temporally with seasonal changes in precipitation, discharge, and soil moisture. In addition, we investigated water stress and efficiency using measures of d '3C, stomatal conductance, and xylem pressure potential. These data demonstrate differences within species across the riparian-upland gradient as well as between species with differing overall distributions. INOUYE, B. UC Davis, Davis CA USA 95616 95616. Polyphagous hosts and the stability of host-parasitoid interactions. Many insect hosts attacked by parasitoids are generalist herbivores and eat a range of plant species. Studies have shown that the characteristics of a plant where an herbivore is feeding, such as trichomes, volatile compounds, and defensive compounds, can influence the likelihood of parasitoid search ing and the final parasitoid attack rate. I present a simple model of a host and parasitoid population, based on the Nicholson-Bailey model, where the host feeds on, and the parasitoid searches on, two different plant types. In this model the herbivore population growth rates and parasitoid attack rates depend on the plant type where an herbivore feeds. I investigated the effects of variation in these parameters, and in the proportion of each plant type used and the fidelity of hosts and parasitoids to plant type across genera tions. Unlike the original Nicholson-Bailey model, which is always unsta ble, the interaction of a polyphagous host and a parasitoid can lead to stable or cyclic population dynamics. Stability is more likely when the parasitoid attack rates on the two plant types are more different, when hosts less often use the plant with the lower attack rate, and when host and parasitoid have low fidelity to plant type. Results of a literature review show that the parameter values necessary to obtain stability or cycles in the model are consistent with the range of host-plant effects observed in the field.

The effects of late spring frosts on the diversity and abundance of flowering in sub-alpine meadows. Spring frosts are common at high altitudes in the Colorado Rocky Moun tains. If they occur early in the spring, before plants are above ground or before they have developed enough to be sensitive to freezing temperatures, these frosts have little if any effect on subsequent flowering. However, if they occur following winters with relatively low snowpack, which result in an early snowmelt and beginning of the growing season, buds and flow ers (which are more sensitive than vegetative parts) of some species of wildflowers may be killed. I used data on flowering by Helianthella quin quenervis (Asteraceae) in two permanent plots (365 and 400 m2) to identify five years since 1974 with significant frost damage to flowering at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (elevation 2,800 m); few if any flowers were produced by this long-lived perennial during those years. I matched these with five years without frost damage (pairs of years were separated by one or two years), and then used data on the timing and abundance of flowering in 14 permanent 2 by 2-m plots to examine the effects of these frost events on the community level (as sampled by plots). In years with frosts, on average 14.5 (range 11-18.5) species flowered per plot, compared with 18.7 (range 17.7-19.8) in years without frosts. I count ed all flowers in the plots about every other day for most of the growing season (most years from 1973-1999), and determined the day on which flowering peaked for the summer. In frost years there was on average a peak of 180 flowers per plot (range 95-230), compared with 367 (range 252-480) in years without frosts. Flowers of most early-flowering species appear to be immune to frost damage, and most late-flowering species are probably not at a sensitive stage at the time when frosts occur. Several species of mid-season wildflowers in particular appear to be sensitive to frost damage, with potentially significant effects for their pollinators, seed predators and parasitoids, as well as their own demography. If the trend for warming nocturnal low temperatures continues, one of the consequenc es of global climate change may be a decrease in these late spring frosts; the consequences could be considered beneficial or deleterious, depending on the species or interaction being studied.

Spatial patterns of population regulation and population viability in sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus spp.). Potential mechanisms driving population fluctuations can be explored by comparing predictions from mechanistic models with time series data. We investigated dynamical mechanisms in sage grouse populations, (Centro cercus urophasianus spp.), in Washington State (WA), Colorado (CO), and Alberta (AB), and assessed the viability of this declining species. Our ob jectives in were to: 1) examine the degree of spatial correlation among geographically separate populations, and 2) test the fit of mechanistic mod els to census counts over time. We used the methods of Dennis et al., 1991 to calculate population viability analyses (PVA's), and modified correlo grams (Koenig, 1998) to assess patterns of spatial variance and covariance. We tested the fit of exponential, delayed-density-dependence, maternal ef fects and host-pathogen models using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and inferential trajectory fit using parameter estimates. AB populations ex hibited consistently high spatial correlation over all distance categories, while CO showed no trend over increasing distances. WA populations were significantly negatively correlated at intermediate distances, while positive ly correlated at near and far distances. To explain sage grouse dynamics, no single model was preferred overall. Exponential and delayed-density dependence models were proportionally favored more than models explic itly incorporating biological mechanisms. Inferential trajectory fits of mod els displayed the trends in the time series data, but not the fluctuations in sage grouse dynamics. Based on life history traits and environmental fac tors we hypothesized explanations for the spatial correlations. Alternately, the significant variation in correlation results could be caused by different dynamics operating in the separate populations. IRVINE, G. V. USGS-BRD, Anchorage, AK USA. Detecting change across broad scales: An inferential design for intertidal monitoring at Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. The detection of change in populations and communities is the goal of many monitoring programs. However, the ability to detect change becomes more complex if broad physical scales and co-occurring spatial variation are involved. Managers of expansive national parks, such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in Alaska, are faced with daunting challenges imposed by the tremendous physical scale of the environments they must manage. Additionally, at Glacier Bay NP&amp;P, gradients set up by the re treating glaciers are correlated with "longitudinal" patterns in species di versity of intertidal communities. A major challenge in designing and im plementing a monitoring program is how to balance the ability to sample across broad physical scales and make inference to the entire managed area versus the sampling intensity necessary to detect changes occurring within biological communities. A three-staged inferential sampling plan was de vised that included: 1) aerial surveys of a subset of coastal segments; 2) low intensity sampling of a large number (25) of sites of a selected habitat type; and 3) high intensity sampling of a few (6) sites of a selected habitat type. An adaptive management approach was adopted, where results of the first phase of sampling informed the decision-making leading to the next phase, etc. Aerial surveys characterized the frequency of different habitat types, and also revealed an unexpected predominance of cobble/boulder habitat. Power analyses of data from the first year's sampling indicated that sampling a large number of sites, even at low intensity, provided a high probability of detecting change in the predominant species (Fucus, mussels, barnacles). The ability to detect change in mussels is contrasted with the gradient in species diversity. The inferential design of the sampling allows managers to extrapolate the results to similar habitat throughout the bay. IRWIN, R. E.

The ef fects of nectar-robbing bumblebees on hummingbird-foraging behavior and pollen flow in Lpomopsis aggregata. Broad-tailed and rufous hummingbirds avoid plants and flowers that have recently been visited by nectar-robbing bumblebees. However, the cues the hummingbirds use to make such choices are not known. To determine the proximate cues hummingbirds use to avoid visiting nectar-robbed plants, I conducted multiple field experiments and one aviary study using the nectar robbed, hummingbird-pollinated plant Ipomopsis aggregata. In the field experiments, free-flying hummingbirds were presented with plants in which I manipulated nectar volume and the presence of nectar-robber holes. Hum mingbirds visited significantly more plants with nectar and probed more available flowers on those plants, regardless of the presence of nectar robber holes. Thus, I hypothesized that hummingbirds may avoid robbed plants based on their spatial memory of unrewarding plants. In an aviary study, I removed spatial cues by re-randomizing the position of plants after each hummingbird-foraging bout, but hummingbirds still selected plants with nectar. These results suggest that hummingbirds use nectar as a prox imate cue to locate and avoid non-rewarding, nectar-robbed plants, even in the absence of spatial cues and simple visual cues. The avoidance of nectar robbed plants by hummingbird pollinators has implications for both the quantity and direction of pollen flow in Lpomopsis aggregata populations. JACKSON, P C.,' F C.

Partitioning of soil water among tree species in a Bra zilian Cerrado ecosystem. Source water used by woody perennials in a Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) was determined by comparing the stable hydrogen isotope composition (SD) of xylem sap and soil water at different depths during two consecutive dry seasons (1995 and 1996). Plant water status and rates of water use were also determined and compared with xylem water AD values. Overall, soil water AID decreased with increasing depth in the soil profile. Mean AlD values were -35%o for the upper 170 cm of the soil and -55%o between 230 126 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="88">and 400 cm depth at the end of the 1995 dry season. Soil water content increased with depth, from 18% near the surface to about 28% at 400 cm. A similar pattern of decreasing soil water AD with increasing depth was observed at the end of the 1996 dry season. Patterns consistent with hy draulic lift were observed in soil profiles sampled in 1995 and 1996. Con current analyses of soil and xylem water 8D values indicated a distinct partitioning of water resources among 10 representative woody species (five deciduous and five evergreen). Among these species, four evergreen and one deciduous species acquired water primarily in the upper soil layers (above 200 cm), whereas three deciduous and one evergreen species tapped deep sources of soil water (below 200 cam). One deciduous species exhib ited intermediate behavior. Total daily sapflow was negatively correlated with xylem sap AD values indicating that species with higher rates of water use during the dry season tended to rely on deeper soil water sources. Among evergreen species, minimum leaf water potentials were also neg atively correlated with xylem water AD values, suggesting that access to more readily available water at greater depth permitted maintenance of a more favorable plant water status. No significant relationship between xy lem water AD and plant size was observed in two evergreen species, sug gesting a strong selective pressure for small plants to rapidly develop a deep root system. The degree of variation in soil water partitioning, leaf phenology and leaf longevity was consistent with the high diversity of woody species in the Cerrado. JACKSON, R. D. and J. W. BARTOLOME. University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A. Understanding California annual grassland structure using a state-transition approach. Using a spatially and temporally replicated dataset, we built a state-tran sition model for California annual grassland. We delineated vegetation states by allowing TWINSPAN to classify plot-level (-10 m 2) species cover data collected from an experimental design that incorporated 5 re sidual dry matter (RDM) treatment levels representative of the range of grazing management prescriptions for this type (0, 280, 560, 841, 1121 kg RDM ha -1). We identified and described a new California annual grassland subtype&lt;Coastal Grassland&lt;as distinct from the previously described Coastal Prairie and Valley Grassland. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis correctly classified 63% of the vegetation transitions among states with interactions among site and monthly climate averages as the main factors. The RDM variable was important in model refinement, but predictions rarely followed any interpretable mulch gradient implicating local spatial variability, rather than RDM response, as important. Plant animal interactions (RDM as grazing surrogate) were not evident. Plant communities were entrained by abiotic factors indicating that nonequilib rium dynamics prevail in this type. JAMES, C.

Regional conservation planning in Australian rangelands. Results from studies of the effects of grazing on native biota in Australian rangelands have indicated a general relationship between changes in bio diversity and grazing intensity. These results show that most species are tolerant of, or advantaged by, grazing activities of cattle and sheep on well managed pastoral properties. However, a small but significant component of the flora and fauna appears to be highly sensitive to grazing. Specific planning is required for their conservation. We use the relationship between grazing intensity and distance from permanent drinking water, in combi nation with responses of biota to grazing, and conservation principles, to develop plans for off-reserve conservation networks at regional scales in Australia's arid rangelands. Landsystem mapping is used as a surrogate for biodiversity distribution where detailed survey data are not available. Fence-line and waterpoint locations are used to assess grazing intensity. These are overlain on landsystems to calculate classes of grazing-distur bance in each landsystem type. Reserve planning principles such as com plementarity of locations, size, spacing and connectivity are considered in developing regional plans but most of the decisions about these variables are "best-guesses" in the absence of data. The economic costs of imple mentation of hypothetical regional conservation plans have also been cal culated. So far, planning has been hypothetical with frequent consultation of pastoralists in the study regions, but economic crises and market op portunities are encouraging pastoralists to implement these ideas. JAMIESON, I. G. and J. ROCK. University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zea land. Extreme variation in body size along a relatively narrow altitude gradient in the alpine tree weta Hemideina maori (Orthoptera: Steno pelmatidae). Evolutionary ecologists have long been aware of latitudinal and altitudinal variation in body size in ectotherms. The most common pattern found is as temperatures decrease with increasing latitude/altitude, maturation tends to be delayed and thus adults emerge at a larger body size. We have recently discovered a body size gradient over a relatively small increase in altitude (450 m) in the alpine tree weta Hemideina maori, a large flightless cricket like insect endemic to New Zealand. Although there are advantages of having large body size for mate competition in male weta and increased fecundity for female weta, adults found at lower altitudes (-1000 m) not only have significantly smaller body sizes but mature two instars earlier than weta found near the summit (1450 m). We tested two hypotheses derived from life-history theory to explain this pattern. 1) Increased tem perature can cause rates of metabolism to increase, bringing age-related adult mortality forward and under such conditions, selection would favour early maturation; and 2) The distribution of weta at their lower/warmer altitude range overlaps with the common gecko, Haplodactylus maculatus, a potential predator of juvenile weta (but not adults), and increased risks in juvenile mortality would also select for early maturation. Data on adult survival rates, predator distribution and weta body size did not support either of these hypotheses. Further common-environment and translocated experiments are planned but in the meantime we conclude that size vari ation in weta is possibly a non-adaptive developmental consequence of temperature induced heterochrony.

Pacific Northwest evergreen forests may persist for centuries and store in excess of 500 Mg C/ha. Because of this potential to store carbon, the impacts of disturbance on carbon flux in these forests are highly relevant to regional carbon dynamics, carbon credits politics, and forest manage ment. To assess the impacts of disturbance it is essential to understand how net ecosystem productivity (NEP) changes over succession. We developed a simple model to investigate this system based on the following assump tions: 1) Carbon pools that change most in terms of absolute amounts over succession are live and dead wood, 2) stand destruction resulting from either natural causes or harvest leaves woody debris in the form of logs, stumps, and roots decomposing on the site, 3) as trees colonize and grow the stand sequesters carbon as live wood. Models including these dynamics and literature based parameterizations indicate that CO2 emitted by decom position of woody detritus following a stand-destroying disturbance ex ceeds CO2 sequestered as live wood in the re-generating stand for 30-40 years. To provide estimates of when NEP of the replacement stand switched from negative (CO2 source to atmosphere) to positive (CO2 sink) we tested the prediction against a chronosequence of primary forest stands that had been harvested. Results indicate the transition from negative to positive NEP for the tree component occurred between 20 and 30 years post-har vest, earlier than model predictions. It is also estimated that regenerating 50-70 year old forest stored approximately 1/3rd as much carbon in woody biomass as 400-600 year old primary forest.

Nitrogen limitation and ecosystem self-organization: The effects of spatial heterogeneity. Insufficient nitrogen resources limit the productivity of many terrestrial ecosystems. Why this occurs and is widespread is puzzling. If nitrogen is Oral Presentation Abstracts 127</page><page sequence="89">deficient, plants that form symbioses with nitrogen -fixing bacteria and are thus independent of nitrogen availability should be able to dominate the community. The dominance by nitrogen- fixing plants should in turn relieve nitrogen limitation. The process or processes responsible for this are not well understood, nor is it established if terrestrial nitrogen limitation is transitory or persistent over long time periods. Here we present and ex amine a new hypothesis, that the dynamic spatial structure of an ecosystem is itself sufficient to induce nitrogen limitation. To explore this hypothesis we generated a probabilistic cellular automata model of two vegetation functional types of vegetation, N-fixers and non-fixers. Vegetation dynam ics were coupled to local nitrogen concentrations that fluctuated in response to the local vegetation present. The model ecosystem when initialized at low densities of randomly located vegetation, the model ecosystem allowed for the coexistence of both vegetation functional types at a state of per manent nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen limitation occurred through the gen eration of self-organized dynamic spatial heterogeneities of ecosystem components. While the importance of spatial patterning to community dy namics has been emphasized for community dynamics the relevance of these dynamics to biogeochemical cycling has not been adequately ex plored. These results support the hypothesis that spatial interactions can be important in both local and regional ecosystem functioning. JESCHKE, J. M.,' M. KOPP2 and R. TOLLRIAN.'

Predator functional response: Dis criminating between handling and digesting prey. We present a mechanistic functional response model that realistically in corporates handling (that is attacking and eating prey) and digesting prey, thereby filling a gap in present functional response theory. We treat diges tion as a background process which does not prevent further foraging ac tivities (searching and handling). Instead, the hunger level is assumed to determine the predator's probability of attack. Additionally, the model ac counts for time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main as sumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term our model the steady state satiation (= SSS) equation. It can, for example, be used to calculate effects of changing predator or prey char acteristics (e.g. defenses) on predation rate. The SSS equation reveals a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e. asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for an infinite prey density). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is defined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (maximum predation rate is lim ited by handling time, e.g. the heterotrophic flagellate Ochromonas) and digestion-limited predators (maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time, e.g. the oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus). Based on available data, we expect that most predators are digestion-limited. JIA, J.,' H. E. EPSTEINI and D. A.

Seasonal patterns of NOAA-AVHRR derived NDVI in Arctic tundra vegetations of the North Slope of Alas ka. Biweekly NOAA Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images were used to examine the seasonal patterns of normalized difference veg etation index (NDVI) and their relationships with climate gradients within four major vegetation types (moist acidic tundra, MAT: moist nonacidic tundra, MNT; wet tundra, WT; and shrub tundra, ST) on the North Slope of Alaska. NDVI was derived from a 4-year time series (1995 -1998) of biweekly AVHRR data for Alaska. A series of simulated digital climate maps and a vegetation map were processed and overlaid with the NDVI grid. Homogeneous vegetation patches for each of the four vegetation types were defined using aerial photos, TM images and vegetation map, with mean size of 30 pixels. Mean and variance statistics of NDVI for each 2 week period were compared among the vegetation types. Throughout the North Slope, there was an obvious spatial variations of peak NDVI along latitude and elevation gradients, i.e., lower peak NDVI in the coastal plain in the north, and higher values in foothill in the south. In most cases, wet tundra had the lowest NDVI values throughout the year, while shrub tundra had the highest values. The peak NDVI appeared in the period of July 22 August 4 (203/216 Julian days) for all four vegetation types, with the value of 0.57 for ST, 0.53 for MAT, 0.41 for MNT and 0.32 for WT. The earliest onset of greenness occurred in ST, followed by MAT and MNT, while WT had the latest onset. There was no obvious linear relationship between peak NDVI and monthly maximum air temperature in the region. It is suggested that more detailed and accurate climate data are necessary for further anal ysis. JOBE, R.,l A. J. MEIER' and S. P.

Spatial distribution of vernal herb in Great Smoky Mountain National Park. The spatial distribution of herbs and the probability of co-occurrence of species are important when considering the impact of disturbance on herb populations. The experimental design consisted of 19 mutually exclusive transects of varying lengths. Observational units of each transect were 90m by 90m quadrats joined pair-wise. A total of 869 quadrats were assessed. For each quadrat, presence or absence for each of 23 herb species was recorded. Analysis against a null hypothesis that herbs occurred randomly throughout the study site revealed that clumping was present in the distri bution of the herb species. Extreme significance was shown for most herbs including, Caulophyllum thalictroides and Podophyllum peltatum. Also, re lationships in the probability of co-occurrence for pairs of species were found. Analysis suggests that herb populations are naturally clumped. Some pairs of showing co-occurrence were Caulophyllum thalictroides by Di centra cucullaria, Trillium erectum by Erythronium americanum, and Ane monella thalictroides by Carex plantaginea. The evidence suggests that vernal herbs exhibit clumped distributions and that some pairs co-occur. JOHNSON, D. W.,' R. J. NORBY,4 W. CHENG,2 J. D. JOSLIN,3 D. E. TODD,4 N. T EDWARDS4 and E. G.

Ef fects of elevated CO2 on nutrient cycling in a sweetgum plantation. The long-term effects of elevated CO2 on growth and carbon (C) seques tration are highly dependent upon the availability and cycling of nutrients. Elevated CO2 can mitigate nutrient deficiencies by facilitating increased uptake and/or biomass production per unit uptake or it could exacerbate nutrient deficiencies by introducing high-C/nutrient ratio litter and/or labile organic compounds into the soil. Many of these interactions have been studied in laboratory or in forests in the seedling to sapling stage; however, the feedbacks among these processes are numerous, complicated, and vir tually impossible to predict outside an ecosystem context. Here we report the initial nutrient cycling results from a study on the effects of elevated CO2 in a closed-canopy sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) plantation. Preliminary results (during the first year of fumigation) indicated a slight growth response (19% in basal area increment) and a downward trend in nutrient concentrations, resulting in little or no additional nutrient uptake. No significant effects of elevated CO2 on soil or soil solution nutrients have yet been detected, but lower decomposition rates of roots from CO2 - en riched plots (in a laboratory study), and a slight effect of elevated CO2 on soil microbial C have been detected. Thus, results at this early stage suggest that the growth increase with elevated CO2 was initially facilitated largely by increased biomass production per unit nutrient rather than by increased uptake or changes in soil availability. We await further data to determine whether this trend continues. JOHNSON, L. C., J. COLES and W. H. DAMMAN. Kansas State Uni versity, Manhattan, KS 6506-4901 USA. Species' constraints limit eco system response to nutrients on an ombrotrophic peat bog. Peat bogs contain nearly 1/3 of the global soil carbon stocks. Yet, controls over productivity and decomposition in peat bogs remain poorly under stood. A 4-year fertilization experiment was aimed at: 1) assessing single or multiple nutrient limitation (N, P, N+P) to productivity and decompo sition in an ombrotrophic peat bog, and 2) determining patterns of nutrient limitation among dwarf shrub species. Application rates were 10 gN/m2 N 128 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="90">and 5g P/m2 annually. Results indicate strong nutrient use complementarity among species; Ledum was co-limited by N and P, Kalmia by P alone, and Gaylussacia by N alone. Chamaedaphne did not respond to either N or P, and may be limited primarily by light. Thus, species' constraints limit eco system response to added nutrients. Laboratory incubations of leaf litter from the dominant dwarf shrubs and of peat soil from the nutrient amended plots assessed nutrient limitation on decomposition. C mineralization of soil showed a slight increase with added N, but decreased by 30% with addition of P. Leaf litter from the 4 dominant species showed no change in C mineralization expressed on a mass basis, but strong species' specific effects on C mineralization became obvious when results were expressed on an areal basis. Thus, our study elucidates the unique and individualistic role that each species plays in determining and constraining ecosystem productivity and decomposition. JOHNSTON MARSHALL, B.,' V. E.

The classification of landscape patterns as interpreted by middle school students. This study investigated the spatial development stages of middle school students requisite for their subsequent understanding of ecological land scapes. Middle school students were given photographic images represen tative of an ecological scale of 1000 km2. These images were then inter preted and recreated by the students with the use of wooden cubes and balls ranging from cubes and balls ranging from 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches. From the students' interpretive representations, the models' footprints were con verted to vector coordinates thus allowing the researchers to employ com mon graphing software (e.g. Microsoft Excel) to generate x,y scatter plots. The resulting plots were compared using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and derivations of statistical methods typically associated with insect aggregation and dispersion, particularly, inferences from the mathematical distribution best fitting the sampling data. A classification scheme based on the organization, proximity and combination of landscape elements was created as a result of this analysis. Patterns were further ranked by the frequency with which they represented students' perceptions. From these results we identified a typical middle school student interpretation of the given landscape and generated learning activities designed to mitigate po tential learning difficulties and developmental delays associated with vi sual-spatial abilities and comprehension of landscape ecology. By address ing these fundamental weaknesses early in the science curriculum, students showed increased understanding of ecological patterns and biological sys tems and were able to recognize and discuss relationships and connections in the context of the ecological landscape.

Hydrologic regimes, disturbance history, and environmental gradients at four forested long-term ecological research sites: Andrews, Cow eeta, Hubbard Brook, and Luquillo. Hydrologic regimes reflect the operation of key moisture storage reservoirs in the vegetation canopy, snow, and soils; hence they influence key eco system properties. These moisture storage reservoirs can be defined by lagged cross-correlations between precipitation and streamflow. They have been determined for four forested sites: Cascade Mountains, Oregon (HJ Andrews LTER); White Mountains, New Hampshire (Hubbard Brook LTER); Smoky Mountains, North Carolina (Coweeta LTER); and Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico (Luquillo LTER). Precipitation and streamflow are coherent at multiple time scales, ranging from daily to annual, and the periodicity and strength of these lagged cross-correlations varies among sites according to their forest canopy type, soils, snow and climate. At Hubbard Brook, which has a seasonal snowpack, but small soil moisture storage, and deciduous forest canopy, streamfiow is highly correlated with precipitation 4-6 months earlier, reflecting a snowmelt influence. At Cow eeta, which also has a deciduous forest canopy, but no seasonal snow, and pronounced spatial heterogeneity of soils, streamfiow is highly correlated with precipitation a few days earlier where soils are shallow, but this cor relation is much smaller and lasts much longer where soils are deep, in dicating a long-term soil moisture reservoir. At Luquillo, which has an evergreen forest canopy, no snow, and a small soil moisture storage, pre cipitation and streamflow are most strongly correlated at scales of days or even shorter time intervals. At Andrews, which has seasonally varying precipitation, some snow, large soil storages, and an evergreen forest can opy, streamflow is significantly correlated with precipitation over multiple time lags ranging from one day to half a year. These storage reservoirs influence stream ecologic processes and may be diagnostic of ecosystem responses to disturbance. JORDAN, M. J., W. A. PATTERSON 1112 and A.

Conceptual fire ecology model for the Long Island, NY pine barrens. A conceptual model summarizes effects of fire on pine barrens species and ecological communities, and will provide ecological guidance for future prescribed burning. Aerial photographs from 1938, 1961 and 1996 were used to produce vegetation maps, from which transition matrices and tra jectories of change for community types were derived. Detailed GIS anal ysis including 1986 aerials, a fire history study, and post-wildfire research provided additional information. In 1938 90% of the 12,000 acre study area was dominated by pitch pine-scrub oak woodland (Pinus rigida, Quer cus ilicifolia), scrub oak shrubland and limited coppice tree-oak shrubland; only 10% was closed-canopy forest (&gt; 60% tree cover). Woodland and shrubland communities had been created by large (100-2,000+ acres) in tense or severe duff-consuming fires that top-killed most trees. Between 1938-1994 fires were smaller (2-500 acres) and -73% of the study area did not burn, or was burned by low severity surface fires. As a result -5,000 acres of shrubland and woodland succeeded or matured into pine oak forest by 1994, creating a mosaic of shrubland + woodland (44%) and forest (56%). In 1995 an unusually severe summer wildfire converted 2,000 acres of woodland and forest back into scrub oak shrubland. The LI Pine Barrens Commission, governmental agencies and The Nature Conservancy are drafting a prescribed fire management plan for maintaining pine barrens and reducing the likelihood of future catastrophic wildfires.

Stimulatory cues for molting of fiddler crab megal opae are specific to salt marshes. Natural estuarine marsh sediments and seawater overlying marshes have been shown to stimulate in situ metamorphosis (molting) of fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) megalopae. We sought to extend our earlier work by testing whether this response is (1) restricted to intertidal salt marshes and (2) observed in another fiddler crab species inhabiting low-salinity marshes. We exposed naive, lab-reared Uca minax megalopae enclosed in plastic mesh cages to both a marsh and a river site separated by 15 m. In both habitats, megalopae were exposed to local waterborne cues without sedi ments. Additional marsh habitat treatments included sediment additions (freshly collected or combusted to remove organic fraction) or no marsh cues (jars of filtered seawater). Examining the megalopae after nearly three days of deployment (ca. 28 h submerged), all those exposed to natural seawater in the marsh had high rates of molting regardless of sediment type. However, megalopae in the river molted at very low rates similar to those enclosed in jars. Results indicate stimulatory waterborne cues for metamorphosis are specific to the salt marsh environment.

Invasion biology of Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus: Competitive effects on a resident species at multiple sites in Florida. Introduction and spread of the container dwelling mosquito Aedfes albop ictus in Florida have been accompanied by declines in resident Aedes ae gypti at some sites. Prior experiments show that when larvae compete, A. albopictus is the superior competitor. In this experiment, we test the hy pothesis that competition among larvae is important at ambient densities at sites where A. aegypti has gone extinct and at sites where it survives. Vases were placed at 3 cemeteries in south Florida where A. aegypti went extinct after invasion by A. albopictus, and at 3 cemeteries where A. aegypti Oral Presentation Abstracts 129</page><page sequence="91">now coexists with A. albopictus. In June, we counted and removed Aedes larvae and pupae, removed eggs, returned water and detritus, and added hatchling A. aegypti and A. albopictus larvae in three treatments: CON TROL-15 or 20 larvae of each species, depending on the cemetery; RE MOVAL-A. aegypti at the same density as in CONTROL and no A. albopictus; INCREASED-A. aegypti at the same density as in CONTROL and twice that number of A. albopictus. After 10 days, we collected larvae, pupae, and adults, and determined survivorship and mean instar (an index of development rate) of A. aegypti. Mean instar was significantly less for INCREASED (4.58+0.08) vs. CONTROL (4.90?0.07), or REMOVAL (5.20+0.08). CONTROL and REMOVAL also differed significantly. Site type effect (aegypti survives vs. aegypti extinct) and interaction were not significant. Survivorship was significantly lower at sites where A. aegypti has gone extinct (36+7%) vs. sites where it survives (63+7%). Despite a significant effect of treatment on survivorship, there were no significant pairwise differences in survivorship among CONTROL (45+?2%), RE MOVAL (51 +?2%), and INCREASED (53+?2%) treatments. Interaction was not significant. Thus, competition among larvae has detectable effects on development rate at approximately ambient densities. Effects of com petition do not differ between sites now with or without A. aegypti (no interaction). However, the site effect on survival suggests that sites where A. aegypti has gone extinct are lower quality sites for A. aegypti, even when A. albopictus is removed. KALKHAN, M. A.,' T. J.

Landscape-scale assessment of plant diversity: Integration of spatial information and spatial statistics. Abstract: Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM), Utah, USA, represents a complex landscape of plant diversity. Key biological parameters can be estimated using some form of multi-scale sampling with a multi-phase design (i.e., double sampling) to provide unbiased estimates of vegetation characteristics. We evaluated the vulnerability of various hab itats to invasion by exotic plants in a 100,000 ha area in the southeast corner of GSENM. A total of 97 Modified-Whittaker nested plots (0.1 ha) were established, and 11 vegetation cover types were found. For modeling large-scale and small-scale variability to predict distribution, presence, and pattern of native and exotic species, and soil characteristics, we integrated remotely sensed data (Landsat TM Data), GIS, and spatial statistics. These models are based on trend surface analysis and stepwise regression. We present examples of trend surface models that describe the large-scale spa tial variability. Models with the smallest variance were selected. In addi tion, the residuals from the trend surface model were then modeled using ordinary kriging. The final surfaces were obtained by combining the trend surface model with the kriged surface of residuals. Our models of spatial continuity of small-scale variability were based on cokriging, a gaussian semi-variogram and other appropriate models (e.g., spherical, exponential, linear) selected for low variance. These models were used to predict the presence of soil variables (carbon, sand, and silt) and native and exotic plant species. KAM, Y.,' Y. H. CHEN,' Y. S. SU2 and Y. S.

Intraspecific competition within and between hatching cohorts of oophagous tadpoles of the Tai wanese tree frog, Chirixalus eiffingere. We studied the dynamic interactions within and between different hatching cohorts of Chirixalus eiffingeri tadpoles reared in pools in bamboo stumps at the Experimental Forest of the National Taiwan University at Chitou, Taiwan, during 1997 and 1998. In a 2 by 3 factorial experiment (Experi ment I), we assessed the effects of early-hatching tadpoles (none, 10 me dium, or 10 large tadpoles) and the brood size of late-hatching tadpoles (10 or 20 small tadpoles) on the growth, survivorship, and metamorphosis of late-hatching tadpoles. Early-hatching (medium and large) tadpoles sig nificantly affected the growth, survivorship, survivorship at metamorphosis, tadpole period, and body mass at metamorphosis of late-hatching tadpoles. The effects of medium and large tadpoles on small tadpoles were similar. An increase in the brood size of late-hatching tadpoles prolonged the tad pole period but did not affect their body mass at metamorphosis or survi vorship at metamorphosis. In Experiment II, we studied the effects of the number of early-hatching tadpoles on late-hatching tadpoles. There were four treatments: 20 late-hatching tadpoles (20S), 30 late-hatching tadpoles (30S), 10 late- and 10 early-hatching tadpoles (lOSlOL), and 10 late- and 20 early-hatching tadpoles (IOS20L). Early-hatching tadpoles decreased the growth and survival of late-hatching tadpoles. All late-hatching tadpoles in the IOS20L treatment died, whereas an increase in brood size of late-hatch ing tadpoles, from 20 to 30, did not affect the survivorship at metamor phosis. Experiments I and II demonstrated that the number, but not the developmental stage, of early-hatching tadpoles had detrimental effects on the growth and development of the late-hatching tadpoles, which has im portant implications for the reproductive strategies of female frogs. The time when the second clutch of eggs is laid is critical to the overall repro ductive success of female frogs. Female frogs should lay a second clutch of eggs only after the early-hatching tadpoles are low in number, which may reduce brooding cost (i.e., supply of trophic eggs) and intraspecific competition between the two cohorts of tadpoles.

Topographic consideration on evapotranspiration, primary production, and soil respiration: An integrated spatially explicit eco system model. In a rugged montane area, topography generates considerable spatial vari ability in solar incident radiation, soil temperature, and soil moisture con tent, which results in heterogeneity of evapotranspiration, primary produc tion, and soil respiration at a landscape scale. To quantify the effect of topography on hydrological and ecological processes, several models were developed in this study. A model of daily topographic radiation aimed to account for spatial and temporal variability in incident radiation. A model of daily-mean soil temperature describes the effect of canopy and forest floor litter and topography. The models require data of maximum and min imum air temperature and digital elevation model (DEM). Air temperature was interpolated with data of adjacent weather stations. Using a radiation model, evapotranspiration was estimated with Penman-Monteith method and primary production with radiation utilization efficiency based on vapor pressure deficit, soil water deficit, and soil temperature. Spatial and tem poral patterns of soil respiration were simulated using soil temperature model and Q10 of soil respiration. The radiation model simulated spatial variability in a montane area (6-13 MJ day-' in annual mean) well. To pographic radiation varied with grid size nonlinearly. When the radiation model was incorporated into soil temperature model, it predicted temporal and spatial patterns of measured data (MAE=0.96 degree in Celcius, bias=0.03 degree in Celcius) successfully. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) ranged from 24 to 30 cm yr-. The model results showed that to pography could generate considerable spatial heterogeneity in hydrological and ecological processes. Since our approach was based on simple models and data commonly available, it would be applied to other areas with little efforts on parameterization. KANG, H. and E. H. STANLEY.

Recent years have witnessed increased concerns about floodplains due to their importance in water quality amelioration, high biodiversity, and the extensive modification of these systems. One such modification is construc tion of levees, whose long-term effects on floodplain ecosystems have rare ly been studied. We measured soil microbial activities (dehydrogenase, and extracellular enzyme activities), soil properties (organic matter, pH, ions, and soil texture), biological attributes (coarse woody debris and litter ac cumulation) and tree species composition in a Wisconsin River floodplain where levees were constructed more than 100 years ago. Higher amounts of litter and organic matter were observed outside the levee compared to areas inside the levee. Further, significantly higher microbial activities (de hydrogenase, ~-glucosidase, phosphatase) per organic matter were found in the soils inside of the levee. These changes were attributed to modified hydrology, which caused differences in water availability, tree species com position (e.g., higher number of oaks outside the levee), and/or soil prop erties (e.g., soil texture). These results suggest that modification of the hydrological regime by levees alter not only the structure of plant com munities but also the functional attributes of floodplain ecosystems. 130 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="92">KASPARI, M., ' J.

We studied the alate phenology of an ant assemblage on Barro Colorado, Panama-a seasonal rainforest. We combined results from two sampling methods-two years of two malaise traps, and one year of two light traps. The 23,156 individuals were sorted to 292 species and morphospecies. Alate flights occurred every week of the year. Half of the most common species flew every month of the year. We analyzed the ef fects of weekly rainfall and lunar phase on flight activity. Quantile regres sion suggested that high weekly rainfall was necessary but not sufficient to produce alate flights in about 1/3 of the common species tested. Lunar phase, in contrast, did not predict alate activity. Common genera, tribes, and subfamilies often differed greatly in phenology, from uniform to highly pulsed reproduction concentrated in different seasons. However, congeneric species groups never significantly staggered flight times, based on results from the Variance Ratio test. To the contrary, most showed positive asso ciations in flight activity over the year. The tropic's benign temperatures offer a yearlong flight window for its ant species that allows for a diversity of phenologies. However, it does not, it appears, promote speciation by temporal prezygotic isolating mechanisms at the monthly timescale. KATZ, G. L.' and J. M.

In the southern Great Plains, the dominant native riparian tree, plains cot tonwood (Populus deltoides subsp. monilifera), depends more on physical disturbance for reproduction than does the exotic Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). We hypothesized that flood control should favor the exotic species. We compared the riparian forest along the unregulated Arikaree River, with the forest on the regulated S. Fork Republican River upstream and downstream of Bonny Reservoir in eastern Colorado, USA. Completed in 1951, Bonny Dam significantly reduces downstream peak and mean flows. We related stem density of both tree species to hydraulic position, and collected increment cores from 694 trees along 9 valley cross sections. In all 3 reaches, cottonwood stands originated during an extended episode of channel narrowing following the 1935 flood of record. There is essen tially no current cottonwood recruitment, since new seedlings are restricted to a narrow frequently disturbed zone within the active channel where survival is unlikely. Compared to cottonwood, Russian olive populations are younger and more uneven-aged, indicating ongoing recruitment under current environmental conditions. Bonny Dam has not yet affected down stream adult cottonwood age structure because no flood large enough to promote significant establishment has occurred since dam construction. KAUSHAL, S. and W. M. LEWIS, JR. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0216. Dynamics of organic carbon and nitrogen in streams draining undisturbed watersheds in the Colorado Rockies. Organic nitrogen has been shown to be an important component of the total dissolved nitrogen load in tropical streams, but relatively little is known about seasonal dynamics of organic nitrogen in streams located in temper ate latitudes. The carbon and nitrogen composition of stream water from two second-order streams draining undisturbed, subalpine watersheds in Colorado was investigated. Samples of stream water were collected at weekly and biweekly intervals and were analyzed for total dissolved nitro gen (TDN), nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dis solved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and par ticulate organic carbon (POC). Concentrations of DOC increased in both streams several weeks before peak runoff to values of 2.7 and 3.2 mg/L. The ratio of DOC to DON in both streams fluctuated seasonally but was lowest during summer months suggesting a release of labile dissolved or ganic matter during the growing season. During peak runoff, there was an increase in nitrate concentrations to values of 0.214 and 0.147 mg/L, and at this time nitrate was the most abundant form of dissolved nitrogen in the two streams. Following peak runoff, nitrate declined to negligible con centrations and DON became the most abundant form of dissolved nitro gen. DON accounted for &gt;50% of the TDN during summer and fall months. Concentrations of DON declined substantially during winter months and concentrations of nitrate increased, probably because of a de crease in biological activity in the watersheds and streams. KAWABE, S. National Institute of Agro-Environmental Sciences, Tukuba 305-8604 JAPAN. A new technique evaluating host suitability in Ophraella communa, an exotic natural enemy of hogweed. The evaluation of ecological impacts of exotic natural enemies on agro ecosystems is a challenging task because they often attack alternative hosts of economic or ecological importance. Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a noxious cosmopolitan weed, is now a pervasive pest in Japan. This weed has a natural enemy, Ophraella communa, which has recently invaded Japan from North America and rapidly expanding its habitats. However, this nat ural enemy also attacks ornamental or edible composites such as Helianthus annuus, H. argophyllus and H. tuberosus, and other weeds such as Xan thium canadense and A. trifida. To study its host range, I used Electronic Measurement on Insect Feeding Behavior (EMF), which has originally been designed to analyze the feeding behavior of insects with sucking mouth parts and is now a widely-used technique because it can identify the specificity of host plant tissues that are fed by many sucking insects. I applied EMF by using our improved computerized device to 0. communa that has chewing mouth parts and found it possible to measure the interval, frequency, speed, duration of feeding and time before feeding. Our EMF device was also found effective in determining of 0. communa actively feeds on alternative hosts, thus testing host suitability. Therefore, EMF is useful to examine the potential of insect natural enemies with chewing mouth parts in controlling troublesome weeds. Evaluation of ecological impact of invasive/introduced organisms on the agro-ecosystems is very important for Japanese agriculture.

Dept. of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford OXI 3PS, UK. Investigations in relative abundance: a comparison of size distri butions of co-occurring, congeneric Mexican trees. Population size distributions were examined for twelve species of trees co occurring at Chamela Biological Station in Jalisco, Mexico. Species had been selected as congeneric pairs and trios similar in gross morphology and ecology in order to better infer generalisations regarding correlates of relative abundance. When compared to expected exponential distributions based on population mean stem diameter, less abundant species were found to have more irregular distributions of individuals among size classes than more abundant species (6 of 6 possible contrasts). Given the agreement with the expectation of the theory of natural selection that more abundant species will be 'better adapted' to local conditions than less abundant spe cies, the results indicate that extraneous confounding factors had been suf ficiently minimized to reveal demographic differences correlated with rel ative abundance. It is suggested that temporal variation in reproductive success is the proximate cause for observed lower abundances, as it is for the greater irregularity in size distributions with which lower abundance is associated. The relationship between relative rarity and irregularity of size distributions was consistent whether within-contrast pairs were central or marginal in their geographic distributions, or a mixture of the two.

Relationships among breeding latitude, timing of migration, and wintering latitude in Wilson's War blers as revealed by hydrogen stable-isotope ratios. Our ability to track migrant songbirds from their breeding areas through migration to their wintering grounds is limited. It has been shown that stable hydrogen isotope ratios can be used as a geographic marker of breed ing latitude that is carried with songbirds through migration to wintering Oral Presentation Abstracts 131</page><page sequence="93">areas. We used a continuous-flow high-temperature pyrolysis elemental an alyzer (Finnigan TC-EA) interfaced with a Delta Plus XL mass spectrom eter to measure the hydrogen isotope ratio of bird feathers. We analyzed the stable hydrogen isotope ratios in the feathers of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) from the breeding season, fall migration, spring migra tion, and winter. We found that for breeding Wilson's Warblers, the latitude where the feather was collected was significantly negatively related to hy drogen isotope ratio (R2= 0.55, P&lt;0.0001, n = 56). We also found a significant positive relationship between hydrogen isotope ratio and timing of capture in the Middle Rio Grande Valley, NM during fall migration (R2= 0.27, P=0.0007, n = 39), but no such relationship during spring migration. Finally, preliminary results suggest that hydrogen isotope ratio on the wintering range is positively related to latitude (R2 = 0.80, P=0.0004, n = 10). These results suggest that Wilson's Warblers that breed in western North America are leapfrog migrants. That is, individuals from the northern portion of the breeding range begin migration earlier and travel further south than individuals breeding at more southern latitudes. KENDALL, B. E.l and G. A. FOX.2 'University of California Santa Bar bara CA 93106 USA U.S.A.; 2University of South Florida Tampa FL USA. Individual variability reduces demographic stochasticity. Population viability analysis uses stochastic demographic models of a pop ulation to predict extinction risk. All else being equal, higher variance in a demographic rate leads to a lower long-term population growth rate and greater extinction risk. By "demographic stochasticity," ecologists mean variance due to differences among individuals. In practice, this is imple mented as sampling error. However, this assumes that each individual's expected fate is identical. For example, demographic stochasticity in sur vival is modeled as a random draw from a binomial distribution. We show that if there is individual variation in expected survival, then existing mod els overestimate the variance due to demographic stochasticity. This is a consequence of Jensen's inequality and the fact that the binomial sampling variance is a concave function of mean survival. The effect of individual variability on demographic stochasticity in fecundity depends on the mean variance relationship for individual reproductive success, which is not pres ently known. If fecundity patterns mirror those of survival, then individual variability will reduce the extinction risk of small populations. KENNEDY SUTHERLAND, E.' and K. T.

Resistance to wounding and spread of decay may be important predictors of forest composition in high-frequency fire regimes in Central Hardwoods forests. We evaluated the patterns of wounding and wound characteristics following multiple prescribed fires in hardwood trees in southern Ohio. One 30 ha plot was burned four times (annually, 1996 to 1999) and another, twice (1996 &amp; 1999). Five common potential overstory species or related groups were identified, including members of the white oak group (Quercus alba and Q. prinus), the red oak group (Q. coccinea, Q. rubra, Q. velutina), Carya sp., Acer rubrum, and Liriodendron tulipifera. Five individuals (20 30cm DBH) with scorched bark from each group were felled and dissected on each burning treatment. Wounding was defined as the death of the vas cular cambium. 90% of sampled trees were wounded by the fires, but most wounds were small (&lt;3cm) and near the ground. Nine of ten Acer rubrum trees were wounded. A. rubrum trees had the largest wounds, wounds were open, and had extensive discoloration. Conversely, red oaks had smaller but several (up to five) wounds. Oak wounds were closed within a year or two of wounding and had limited discoloration. Carya sp. were interme diate in wounding and response patterns. These results are evidence that the ability to resist wounding and decay from mechanical damage such as fire are important predictors of species composition in hardwood forests. KENNEDY, B. P.,' K.

The effects of habitat limitation on consumption rates of ju venile Atlantic salmon. We used fluxes of naturally occurring cesium (Cs) to compare in situ con sumption rates of stocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fry in tributaries of the Connecticut River. Foraging-based models suggest that suitable for aging habitat during the early season (3 to 6 weeks after stocking) is critical to juvenile salmon performance, however our inability to measure con sumption rates in the field has previously limited our ability to test this relationship. Building upon radioisotope approaches, we parameterized a model of Cs uptake and turnover in salmon fry that allowed us to measure integrated consumption rates over time scales of weeks to seasons. Field based estimates for assimilation efficiencies showed no differences among sites, however interspecific differences in the Cs concentration of common prey taxa emphasize the importance of quantifying fish diet composition. Significant differences in consumption rates across sites were correlated with underyearling survival. Our results compare favorably with those of a spatially-explicit individual based model and support hypothesized re source and habitat limitation during the early season. High variability in consumption rates and decoupling of growth and consumption when fish are less than 6 weeks old suggests that this a challenging time for fry when habitats are limiting and energetic demands are high. KENNEDY, T A. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA. The impacts of exotic salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) on organic mat ter dynamics in a desert spring stream. Salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima) is an exotic species that has become the dominant riparian tree along many rivers throughout the southwestern Unit ed States. Many studies have looked at the impacts of this species on the terrestrial environment, however few studies have addressed the impacts that this species has on rivers. Here I examined the impacts of salt cedar on organic matter dynamics in Jackrabbit spring, a small desert spring at Ash Meadows NWR in southern Nevada. Allochthonous litter inputs, litter retention, and litter decomposition rates in the stream were assessed in reaches within each of three different riparian vegetation types (native veg etation, salt cedar, experimental salt cedar removal) present along Jackrab bit spring. Bullrush (Scirpus americanus) litter dominates inputs to the stream in the native vegetation sites, salt cedar is the dominant input at salt cedar sites, and at experimental removal sites bullrush that has re colonized since removal is the major input. Ash (Fraxinus velutina) is a minor component of litter inputs at all sites. Total litter inputs in native vegetation sites were significantly greater than in salt cedar sites which were greater than inputs in experimental removal sites. Litter retention is significantly higher in native vegetation sites than in salt cedar or experi mental removal sites. ANCOVA was used to explore the relationship be tween decomposition rates of the three dominant litter inputs (ash, salt cedar, and bullrush) and vegetation type, water temperature, and stream velocity. Decomposition rates were highest for ash, followed by salt cedar , and then bullrush. Vegetation type significantly affected decomposition rates independent of the effects of temperature and velocity, with decom position being more rapid in native sites than in either salt cedar or ex perimental removal sites. This study demonstrates that salt cedar has a variety of impacts on organic matter dynamics in Jackrabbit spring includ ing a decrease in total allochthonous litter inputs, a change in the types of inputs from slow decomposing rushes in native sites to faster decomposing salt cedar in salt cedar sites, decreased litter retention, and a decrease in decomposition rates regardless of litter type.

A fundamental question in plant ecology is whether and how the intensity of competition changes with productivity. This question has been the source of considerable discussion during the last few decades. Often artificial pro ductivity gradients have been created in order to address this question. Fewer studies have measured competition intensity (CI) along natural gra dients, with only a subset of these distinguishing between the above and belowground components of competition. We examined the intensity of total, above and belowground competition along a natural soil depth gra dient in an old field where flat clay plain overlay undulating gneiss bedrock. Four distinct plant communities could be discerned, rocky outcrops, grass dominated areas, areas dominated by Asters and Solidagos and areas dom inated by Lythrum salicaria, which flood in the spring. Two test species or phytometers (Lythrum salicaria and Liatris spicata) were grown along the 132 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="94">gradient in four treatments: without neighbours, with neighbour's roots only, with neighbours' roots and shoots and with a cage to reduce herbivory while growing with both neighbour's roots and shoots. The final biomass of each phytometer in each treatment (after one growing season) was then measured. Overall, the intensities of total competition and belowground competition were significantly greater than zero (p&lt;0.05), whereas that of aboveground competition was not. This was true for both phytometers. Apparently, competition in that system is primarily belowground. Rock outcrops had the greatest competition intensity, with CI then decreasing with increasing soil depth and biomass. Herbivory, however, did not change along the gradient for either phytometer. Therefore, herbivory does not change with competition intensity. KERKHOFF, A. J., S. N. MARTENS and B. T MILNE. University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA. Ecological optimality in semi arid woodlands: Testing Eagleson's ecohydrological equilibrium. Eagleson's ecological optimality theory predicts that water-limited natural vegetation systems exist in a stable equilibrium with their climatic and soil environments. According to Eagleson's hypothesis, the equilibrium is main tained in the short term by canopy adjustments toward a density that min imizes average annual water demand stress. Alternatively, we hypothesize that fitness pressures may act to maximize canopy evapotranspiration. Ea gleson's water balance framework allows us to predict optimal canopy den sities, and their variation over a complex topographic landscape, based on spatially explicit estimates of climate, soil, and vegetation parameters from the Sevilleta LTER. We confront the alternative optimal canopy predictions (minimum stress vs. maximum transpiration) with empirical canopy esti mates drawn from high resolution, remotely sensed data. Empirical canopy densities are generally intermediate between the two hypotheses, and the spatial patterning of residual variation is related to both model assumptions and landscape characteristics. Our results highlight the need to incorporate fuller descriptions of canopy transpiration and run-on dynamics in future models, as well as the need to understand the scaling of ecohydrological processes. The statistical mechanical basis of Eagleson's approach provides a powerful (and largely unutilized) method for developing biophysical models of landscape ecological dynamics, and the analytic nature of the resulting theory represents a useful alternative to complicated numerical simulations. KIER, G., J. MUTKE and W. BARTHLOTT. University of Bonn, Germany. Mapping of species richness and endemism on the continental to global scale using new methodological approaches. Biodiversity maps are an effective means of communicating ecological in formation. They are often made by adding up the distribution maps of individual taxa ("taxon-based approach"). Two maps are presented which are based on alternative methodological approaches ("inventory-based ap proaches"). The first one is a world map which displays the number of vascular plant species per 10,000 sq km. On the second map, an index which combines species richness and endemism ("endemism richness", sometimes also referred to as an index of range size rarity) is displayed for the seed plants of the 20 regions of the African continent as delineated by White. The world map of vascular plant species richness is based on the number of vascular plant species occuring in geographical units (e.g., countries, provinces, mountain ranges, deserts) covering all continents. As the geographical units are of different size, their species numbers were standardized to make them comparable by applying the species-area model of Arrhenius. Interpolation techniques were used to estimate species rich ness of those regions for which species numbers were not known and to differentiate species richness values within larger geographical units. Many essential steps of the methodology used for Barthlott's world map were completely revised, such as the standardization procedure and the inter polation techniques, and the number of geographical units in the data base was enlarged by 80 percent. General results are that all regions with more than 5000 species per 10,000 sq km are located in the humid tropics and subtropics. In some Mediterranean regions, the values reach 3000 to 4000 species per 10,000 sq km. For the map of African seed plant endemism richness, a calculation method was used which was based on the division of the flora of these regions into chorological groups. Minimum values of endemism richness can be observed in the Sahel and Sahara regions, where as the highest value was calculated for the Cape region, followed by East Madagascar with a considerably lower score. We argue that endemism rich ness can be regarded as the specific contribution of an area to global bio diversity. KIESECKER, J. M. Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802. Parasitism and the distribution of pond breeding amphibians. Understanding the role that infectious diseases play in natural communities is one of the key questions in community ecology. In spite of the potential significance of disease agents influencing community structure, little is known about how parasitic infections and other known important factors (e.g. competition, predation, disturbance) may interact to modify commu nity structure. Communities composed of larval amphibians and their pred ators have become a model for understanding the interrelationship among physical and biotic agents structuring the pattems of abundance and dis tributions of animals. This understanding is grounded on the firm base of experimental findings that have emphasized the role of the permanence of aquatic habitats. Specifically, these experiments show that the timing of pond drying, competition for food, and predation can all have important effects on tadpoles. Unfortunately, no attempts have been made to incor porate how other factors, including parasites, may influence distributional patterms. Here, I report the results of a set of experiments designed to determine how digenetic trematode infection might act selectively to limit distributions of amphibians. I measured the performance of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) and green frogs (Rana clamitans) in response to infection by several snail-trematode combinations. I asked whether growth rate differed between tadpoles growing in the presence of infected versus uninfected snails. The answer differed for the species tested and trematodes species to which they were exposed. The results suggested that species living in one pond type (e.g. temporary) perform relatively poorly when in the pres ence of trematode infection from another pond type (e.g. permanent). Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to strong gradients in hydro period, predation and competition, differences in infection may contribute to amphibian distributional patterms.

Nutrient resorp tion in shrubs growing by design, and by default along a Chihuahuan Desert arroyo. In the northem stretches of the Chihuahuan Desert, the margins of ephem eral stream channels called arroyos support vegetation dominated by a guild of winter-deciduous shrubs. We measured nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and zinc (Zn) resorption efficiency and proficiency in the six dominant species of such a guild in southem New Mexico. Collectively, these six species were no more efficient or proficient at resorbing N and P from senescing leaves than shrubs growing in other environments. However, re sorption efficiency and proficiency varied significantly between plants spe cifically restricted in their distribution to riparian habitats (species growing by design), and those that were not (species growing by default). The two species growing by design (Brickellia laciniata and Chilopsis linearis) were more efficient and proficient at resorbing N than species growing by default (Fallugia paradoxa, Flourensia cernua, Prosopis glandulosa, and Rhus microphylla), and than any other group of plants to which they were com pared. In addition to the effects on resorption conferred by whether shrubs grew by design or by default, leaf surface area, specific leaf mass, nutrient concentrations in green leaves, and the ability of fix nitrogen influenced resorption as well.

Ecophysiological basis of seedling shade Oral Presentation Abstracts 133</page><page sequence="95">tolerance of A. crenata was examined in terms of whole-plant carbon al location patterns for 1-6 months old seedlings in a green house. A. crenata seedlings exhibited a high degree of self shading, which resulted in a low efficiency of light interception and daily photosynthetic income per unit leaf area. Concentration of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) was high in roots and stems of 2 months old seedlings raised from seeds under 4 % of full sun (44% and 22 % of dry mass, respectively) and higher than similar-sized seedlings collected in the forest understory. Greenhouse seed lings subsequently transferred to 24 % and 2 % of full sun exhibited typical whole-plant acclimation responses and ontogenetic shifts, and differed in relative growth rates (26 and 18 mg/g/day, respectively) and TNC concen tration in tap roots (48% and 30 % of root mass, respectively, at 6 months after germination). High carbon allocation to storage appears important for survival and maintenance of slow growth of A. crenata, while its architec ture of shading itself and neighbors enhances its competitive potential in the shaded understory.

A classification of riparian wetland plant associa tions of Colorado. A classification of riparian plant associations for Colorado was developed to understand riparian vegetation diversity and functionality. The nine year project designed a comprehensive, field-based, classification of riparian wetlands. Between 1990 and 1999, over 1880 quantitative plots were col lected using a systematic, stratified-random site selection approach and con sistent field data collection on USGS designated perennial and ephemeral streams. 150 native plant associations were described, including conifer forests, deciduous woodlands, willow shrublands, non-willow shrublands, herbaceous meadows, alkaline flats, acidic fens, and alpine peatlands. Ri parian areas dominated by non-native species were not described. Sampling occurred on public and private land. Results indicate the classification cov ers an estimated 80-90% of Colorado's riparian wetland diversity. Some plant associations are very rare and unique to Colorado, others are quite common, known from literately hundreds of streams. While Colorado's riparian areas cover less than 3 percent of the land area in the state, they house over 40% (1220 taxa) of the known plant species in the State. Of the 150 riparian plant associations, 43 (29%) are ranked GI to G2-critically imperiled to imperiled globally; 49 (32%) are ranked G3-vulnerable, and 58 (38%) are ranked G4 to G5-apparently to demonstrably secure globally.

Once and future climates of the conter minous United States: Spatial-temporal variability in the VEMAP2 his torical and scenario bioclimate dataset. Climate varies across continental regions in characteristic spatial and tem poral patterns that strongly influence vegetation dynamics and biogeochem ical processes, such as disturbance regimes and carbon storage. The Veg etation/Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project (VEMAP) Phase 2 his torical and future scenario climate dataset for the conterminous US was developed as inputs for the simulation of vegetation and ecosystem dynam ics over the period 1895-2100, with future climates derived from coupled climate model experiments. To understand the nature of the driving cli mates for ecological simulations, we evaluated spatial-temporal variability in seasonal thermal and moisture parameters (e.g., minimum and maximum temperature, precipitation, Palmer Drought Severity Index, growing-degree days). During the historical period, thermal variables exhibited spatially extensive (often dipolar) oscillations across the conterminous US at inter annual and decadal time scales. Precipitation variability regimes were also prominent, but with characteristically shorter spatial scales and were more complex in time and space. 21st century climates, while dominated by trends in the means (driven by enhanced greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol forcings), exhibited strong patterns of spatial and temporal variability that were altered from those of the historical period.

High levels of gene flow and genetically-based differentiation in life history traits between local subpopulations of the perennial yellow bush lupine, Lupinus arboreus. Across large spatial scales, plants often exhibit genetically based differ entiation in traits that allow adaptation to local sites. At smaller spatial scales, similar results have been found in cases where sharp boundaries between edaphic conditions create strong gradients in selection that can overcome the high levels of gene flow. Few studies, however, have ex amined the degree to which continuous populations of perennial plants exhibit genetically based differentiation in life-history traits over small spa tial scales. We quantified levels of gene flow and determined the degree of genetically based differentiation in adaptive traits between two grassland and one dune subpopulation of yellow bush lupine, Lupinus arboreus. Pop ulations grew in close proximity to one another, and were part of a larger continuous population of L. arboreus. We calculated Fst statistics based on gel electrophoresis of 10 polymorphic loci from two age classes of L. arboreus: seeds from one year, and juvenile plants that were less than two years old. We created full-sib/half-sib families of lupine within each sub population, and established reciprocal common gardens at each site. Across 3 years, we measured canopy volume, mortality, flowering time, and seed set of progeny planted in each garden. Differentiation among subpopula tions of seeds and juvenile plants was virtually non-existent (F,,= 0.002 and 0.041 respectively), suggesting that gene flow between the three sub populations was quite high (estimated Nm ranged from 18 to &gt;1000). De spite high levels of gene flow, we found strong evidence for local adap tation and genetically-based differentiation in adaptive traits such as plant size, flowering phenology, fecundity and mortality. Environmental factors within gardens also produced fitness related responses in growth, survival and seed production. Our results indicate that there is a surprising amount of divergence in life-history traits between local subpopulations of L. ar boreus. Given the homogenizing influence of gene flow, it is likely that strong but differing selection regimes operating within each subpopulation drive spatial differentiation in lupine life history traits.

Species richness (S) is becoming increasingly important from a conserva tion biology perspective (biodiversity inventories), yet our efforts to ac curately measure S at different sites and statistically compare these values is still problematic. Prior evaluations of statistical estimators of S have concentrated on their statistical behavior but not on their accuracy. We examined the accuracy 7 indices (Chaol, Chao2, ACE, ICE, Jackl, Jack2, and Bootstrap estimators) for extrapolating maximum species richness (Smax) and compared them to true S for a 16 hectare vegetation dynamics grid in the Luquillo mountains of Puerto Rico. The grid was subsampled at 25m2, lOOm2, 400m2 and 1 ha units to examine the effect that different sized plots might have on each of the estimators. By subsampling the larger grid, we could determine whether a series of subsamples of a larger area was capable of accurately estimating Sm,x of that larger area (analogous to carrying out a diversity inventory). We calculated the various estimators using EstimateS (Colwell 1997). All estimators of Smax exceeded the true Smax after approximately 65% of the total area was sampled. This was true regardless of the dimensions of the individual samples. Individual sample dimensions did, however, affect the performance of the different estimators. Incidence-based estimates (Chao2, ICE, and Jack2) increased with increas es in the size of individual samples while one incidence-based estimator (Bootstrap) and the abundance-based estimators (Chaol1, ACE, and Jackl) were not affected by the size of individual samples. Overestimates of true Smax varied from 22-70% higher than true species richness. We conclude that current mathematical methods for extrapolating Sma from a set of samples are inadequate and suggest that efforts to develop statistical meth ods for comparing S among sites (bootstrapping procedures), given similar sampling intensities, might be a more productive avenue of research. 134 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="96">KLOEPPEL, B.

Modeling tree stem temperature to estimate wood respiration. Forest carbon cycling has received increasing attention as hypotheses re lated to global climate change are tested to predict long-term environmental effects. While forest carbon pools at the stand level are relatively easy to estimate, forest carbon fluxes remain difficult to estimate due to multiple driving variables. The woody respiration of southern Appalachian forests has been estimated by invoking a stratified random sampling design in cluding forest stands in three topographic positions (ridge, midslope, and cove) and three age classes (200+ years, -100 years, -20 years). Allo metric relationships were developed and used to scale measurements to the tree level. Stand biometric data were used to scale respiration estimates to the stand level. Relationships relating stem temperature to air temperature were needed to estimate stem wood respiration flux. Four sites measuring air temperature and stem temperature on 25 or more trees were established on north and south facing slopes in mature and old growth study sites. Four potential models were evaluated to predict stem temperature from climate station air temperature data: Lag, sinusoidal curve, single tree regression, and whole site regression. Single tree analyses indicated that up to 94.8 % of the variation in stem temperature data was explained by air temperature whereas sensor aspect, tree height, tree diameter, and topographic position explained only minimal variation. Previous data sets indicate that stem respiration Qlo values ranged from 1.63 in red maple to 2.57 in chestnut oak. Summarized calculations of woody respiration for nine southern Ap palachian forest stands ranged from 305 to 770 g m-2 soil year'. KLUG, J. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, U.S.A. Interac tions between bacteria and phytoplankton affect algal response to nu trients and dissolved organic matter. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) may affect phytoplankton growth in sev eral ways. A major negative effect is the limitation of phytoplankton growth by shading from absorbance of light by colored DOM. However, DOM may also change the availability of inorganic nutrients directly, since it contains nitrogen and phosphorus or indirectly, by affecting bacterial processes. Bacterial degradation and respiration of DOM may change the algal availability of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. I conducted short term cubitainer experiments to explore the multiple effects of DOM on phytoplankton in West Long Lake located in Upper Michigan. When ex periments were performed at low light levels, algae did not respond to additions of nutrients or DOM presumably because they were light limited. At intermediate or high light levels, algal response to added nutrients and DOM depended on the bacterial response. Mass balance calculations sug gest that algae benefited when bacterial respiration of DOM prevented them from being carbon limited but were adversely affected when bacteria were able to sequester all the available phosphorus. These results suggest that algae-bacteria interactions are important for predicting the relationship be tween algae and DOM. KNIGHT, C. A. and D. D. ACKERLY.

The chloroplast low molecular weight heat shock protein (cLMW HSP) has been implicated in the protection of photosystem II during and after severe temperature stress, yet little evidence exists that plants growing in the field actually express cLMW HSPs in response to naturally occurring environmental stress. Here we show not only that plants growing in the field use the cLMW HSP response, but that cLMW HSP expression is correlated with the microclimate in which plants are growing, and that cLMW HSP expression tracks changes in average air temperature through out the season. Weekly leaf collections for three Ceanothus cuneatus in dividuals growing on exposed south facing slopes and three individuals of the same species growing on relatively cooler north facing slopes were conducted at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in the Northern California chaparral. Plants growing on south facing slopes expressed cLMW HSPs more frequently and intensely than did plants growing on the north facing slopes. Chloroplast LMW HSP expression in the plants growing on south facing slopes was also correlated with extreme maximum air temperature events during the summer months, and absent during an unseasonably cool period during late July and early August. Because C. cuneatus is co-dom inant on south facing slopes in the Jasper Ridge chaparral and less abundant on north facing slopes, we conclude that cLMW HSP expression is a fre quent occurrence in areas where C. cuneatus is most abundant and not just limited to the edges of the species distribution.

Persistence or extinction: A demo graphic analysis of elevated herbivore pressure in an herbaceous un derstory community. Current deer numbers are creating significant disturbances in herbaceous communities in the eastern half of North America. To quantify the impact of a local recent and dramatic increase in deer herbivory, we monitored three pairs of large fenced exclosure and unmanipulated control plots over six years. While deer herbivory significantly influenced overall species richness, abundance, and composition of the herbaceous understory com munity, the herbaceous species exhibited dramatic variation in their re sponses to the presence of deer. A detailed analysis of Trillium grandiflo rum indicated that deer impact both the stage structure and overall size of this long-lived perennial. Specifically, herbivory significantly decremented both above ground and below ground growth, and thus prevented plants from reaching the size threshold necessary to reproduce. Furthermore, the ratio of reproductive stems to percent cover indicated that deer herbivory reduced the demographic representation of reproductive individuals in six other common understory species. This study provides evidence for a de mographic mechanism by which elevated deer browse reduces understory plant populations and ultimately alters community composition. KNOX, R. G.,' J. BAIR,' P. A.

Primary and secondary con trols on measurements of forest height using large-footprint lidar at the Hubbard Brook LTER. On September 26, 1999, we mapped canopy structure over 90% of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire, using the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). This airborne instrument was configured to emulate data expected from the Veg etation Canopy Lidar (VCL) space mission. We compared aboveground heights of the tallest surfaces detected by lidar with average forest canopy heights estimated from tree-based measurements in or near 346 0.05 ha plots (made in autumn of 1997 and 1998). Vegetation heights had by far the predominant influence on lidar top heights, but with this large data set we were able to measure two significant secondary effects; those of steep ness or slope of the underlying terrain and of tree crown form. The size of the slope effect was intermediate between that expected from models of homogeneous canopy layers and for solitary tree crowns. The first detected surfaces were also proportionately taller for plots with more basal area in broadleaved northern hardwoods than for mostly coniferous plots. We ex pected this because of the contrast between the shapes of cumulative dis tributions of surface area for elliptical or hemi-elliptical tree crowns and those for conical crowns. Correcting for these secondary effects, when appropriate data are available for calibration, may improve vegetation struc ture estimates in regional studies using VCL or similar lidar data sources. KOBZA, R. M. and J. C. TREXLER. Florida International University, Mi ami, FL 33199. The role of seasonal hydrology in the dynamics of fish communities inhabiting karstic wetlands of the florida everglades. We studied the role of hydrological variation and availability of dry-season refugia in shaping the structure of fish communities in karstic wetlands of the Florida Everglades. The Rocky Glades is a wetland region of the ex treme southeastern Everglades that is flooded for less than 6 months in most years. Solution holes serve as refugia for aquatic organisms, espe cially fishes, during the dry season. Our study addressed the following questions: Do fishes accumulate into predictable assemblages in solution Oral Presentation Abstracts 135</page><page sequence="97">holes during the dry season? Do abiotic characteristics of solution holes such as depth, water quality, or habitat complexity determine the assem blage of fishes that persist there? And, how do biotic interactions, especially predation, influence which species survive the dry season to recolonize the marsh surface when the rainy season arrives? To assess relative abundance of fishes, we sampled 19 solution holes in Everglades National Park week ly, between December and June, 1999, with non-destructive activity traps, coupled with mark-release-recapture techniques. We collected over 2,500 fishes in 17 species during the study period. The abundance of fishes in creased early in the dry season, followed by intense mortality in mid-April. Principal components analysis indicated that fish relative abundance changed during the dry season with early colonization by bluefin killifish and sailfin mollies, followed by piscivorous species in mid-March with concomitant decline in small-sized species. Over 50% of the piscivorous fish were introduced species, such as walking catfish and two cichlids. Introduced fishes appeared to tolerate the stressful solution-hole environ ment in the late dry season better than most native species. Our results suggest that secondary production of fishes in the Rocky Glades is reduced by mortality during the annual dry season because solution hole refugia are limited in number and experience poor water quality. KOCH, G. W.' and S. C. SILLETT.2 1Northern Arizona University, Flag staff, AZ USA 86011; 2Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA, USA 95521 . Water potential, gas exchange, and carbon isotope discrimi nation in very tall coast redwoods, Sequoia sempervirens: Support for the hydraulic limitation hypothesis. It is unclear what slows the growth and limits the height of trees as they age. The hydraulic limitation hypothesis of Ryan and Yoder attributes this to the reduction in stomatal conductance (and consequent gas exchange) required to reduce the risk of cavitation in conducting tissues as hydraulic path length and resistance increase. To test the hydraulic limitation hy pothesis, we examined patterns of water potential, gas exchange, and car bon isotope discrimination in foliage sampled along height gradients in very tall (90 - 110 m) and ancient (500 - 2000 yr) individuals of coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, at several sites in Mendocino and Hum boldt County, California. We used rope techniques to access tree crowns with ecophysiological equipment. Predawn xylem pressure potential con formed closely to the theoretical static gravitational gradient, decreasing by an average of 0.011 ? 0.001 MPa per meter in 8 trees over 90 m in height. Mid morning to midday gradients were steeper and more variable. Gas exchange and stable carbon isotope (613C) measurements indicated that foliage operates at lower internal carbon dioxide partial pressures as height in the canopy increases; fi3C in sunlit foliage was strongly and positively correlated with height, increasing by 0.08 ? 0.02 per mil per meter between 30 and 100 m. When the gravitational and pathlength constraints on water availability were bypassed, the uppermost foliage showed large and sig nificant increases in conductance, internal carbon dioxide partial pressure, and photosynthesis. We believe gas exchange and growth in the upper crowns of S. sempervirens respond to seasonal and interannual variation in abiotic conditions in a dynamic manner that is consistent with the hydraulic limitation hypothesis. Our results have implications for understanding pat terns of top die back in tall S. sempervirens and the response of this species to climate change. KOHLER, S. L.,I L. C. HINZ, JR.2 and M. J. WILEY.2 l Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI 49008, USA; 2The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. Indirect effects of competition: Increased vul nerability to predators. The caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior has strong competitive effects on many other primary consumers in trout streams. Strong resource depression by Glossosoma should affect the foraging behavior of its competitors in ways (e.g., increased time spent foraging, increased movement rate while for aging) that should increase their vulnerability to predators. We tested this hypothesis in laboratory experiments using a perlid stonefly and the mottled sculpin as predators and mayfly larvae (Baetis tricaudatus) as prey. We manipulated periphyton abundance on stones in laboratory flumes, and al lowed predators (either 1 sculpin or 5 stoneflies) access to 3 size classes of Baetis larvae for 24 h. For both predators, Baetis mortality increased exponentially with decreasing periphyton availability. Both the stonefly and sculpin consumed significantly more small Baetis than the other size clas ses. Observations of invertebrate and trout populations in 12 streams sup port the operation and importance of this mechanism in natural commu nities. In these streams, Glossosoma populations varied markedly over a 4 yr period within and among streams because of pathogen-induced mortality. A path analysis model of hypothesized trophic interactions in these com munities indicated a significant, positive effect of Glossosoma abundance on juvenile brook trout growth rate. Because trout rarely consume Glos sosoma, we conclude that this effect actually represents the trait-mediated indirect effect of Glossosoma on the vulnerability of its competitors to trout, which can only be represented in a path model as a direct effect of Glossosoma on trout. Thus, Glossosoma appears to have strong negative effects on its competitors through exploitative competition and by influ encing their foraging behavior, which modifies their interaction with in vertebrate and vertebrate predators. KOPP, M.' and R. TOLLRIAN.2 1Max-Planck-Institute for Limnology, Ploen, Germany; 2Ludwig-Maximilian University, Munich, Germany Prey-induced size polymorphism in a ciliate predator. Food dependent size polymorphism in the predacious hymenostome ciliate Lembadion bullinum was assesed. In addition, morphological counter-re action of a predator to inducible prey defenses was observed. When Lem badion was cultured with various prey ciliates,cell size was positively cor related with the size of the respective prey. Mean cell volume varied by about a factor of 2.5. Large prey could only be swallowed by large morphs of the predator. However, when confronted with a mixture of prey Lem badion always adjusted its size to that of the smallest prey species. To find the reason for this close correlation to the size of the smallest available prey, we measured short term feeding rates and long term growth rates under various conditions. The results show that small predators were more efficient in capturing small prey. In addition, when fed with small prey, small predators attained higher population growth rates than large preda tors. Lembadion also increased in size when one of its prey species, Eu plotes octocarinatus, developed an inducible morphological defense ('winged morph'). The enlarged predators were better able to capture the defended prey. We conclude that the size polymorphism of Lembadion is an adaptation to maximize this predator's hunting efficiency (attack coef ficient) under various feeding regimes. When small prey was present, small morphs of the predator were favored because large cell sizes were asso ciated with demographic costs. Finally, the observation that Lembadion reacted plastically to morphological changes of Euplotes may lead to the hypothesis that this plasticity evolved as a coevolutionary adaptation to inducible defenses of its prey. KORB, J. E., W. COVINGTON and P Z. FULE. Northern Arizona Uni versity, Flagstaff, AZ 86011, U.S.A. The role of the soil seed bank in understory Ponderosa Pine restoration. The soil seed bank often plays an important role in the natural regeneration of herbaceous and woody vegetation following disturbance. Environments with numerous native seeds in the soil bank can often reestablish without manual seeding of native species. In addition, the soil seed bank can be used as a potential indicator of early successional community response following disturbance. The effects of restoration tree thinning on the soil seed bank in a northern Arizona ponderosa pine forest were investigated using the seedling emergence method. Three thinned units and three uncut controls of approximately 20-ha were each sampled. Seed bank samples were separated into different depth distributions: litter, 0-5 cm, and 5-10 cm. A total of 36 species were present to a depth of 10 cm. Five of these species were not present in the aboveground vegetation of the study area. Seed density and diversity were highest in the 0-5 cm depth for both thinned and uncut units. Seed diversity was unaffected by thinning treat ments; however, seed density was greater in the uncut control units. The number of native viable seeds/m2 in the litter layer was a significantly higher (p&lt;O.05) than the number of exotic viable seeds/m2 in the litter layer. There was no significant difference (p&lt;O.O5) between the number of native and exotic viable seeds/m2 in the 0-5 cm or 5-10 cm depth. As a result, prescribed fire may initially reduce the number of native viable seeds/m2 when the litter is consumed during burning. Verbascum thapsus, an exotic early successional species, dominated the number of viable seeds/ 136 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="98">m2 for the thinned (24%) and control (30%) units. These seeds were highly clustered and were more prevalent in areas subject to repeated historical disturbance (thinning and grazing). Similarily, native weedy annuals were more dominate in areas of repeated disturbance. These preliminary study results indicate that restoration thinning does not have a negative effect on soil seed bank species richness or the distribution of seeds within the soil profile. These results do indicate however, that land management history (amount of repeated disturbance over time) may play an important role in the recovery response of the herbaceous and woody understory in ponde rosa pine restoration. KOROL, R. L. USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula MT, 59807 USA. Physiological adaptations of nine coniferous species of the northern Rocky Mountains to environmental change. The efficiency with which trees use water is a major determinant of growth under water-limited conditions. This study investigated whether increased access to water and nutrients due to management practices alters the effi ciency with which nine coniferous trees species use water. Intrinsic tran spiration efficiency, defined here as the ratio of CO2 assimilated and water transpired at a given vapor pressure deficit, is determined by the difference between the ambient atmospheric (ca) and the intercellular CO2 concentra tion within leaves (ci). The mean value of ci/ca can be inferred from an analysis of carbon isotope discrimination (A) in wood samples. We mea sured carbon isotope ratios of wood samples from trees growing at a range of sites with widely varying soil and climatic conditions in the Inland northwest. Six hundred trees were cored and distinct annual rings were analyzed for their carbon isotope ratio. The selected trees represented a range of environmental (site) and stand conditions. We found that the in ferred ci/ca decreased with decreasing water availability, which suggested that intrinsic transpiration efficiency increased with decreasing water avail ability. Discrimination varied by 4.0%o, which corresponds to a decrease in intrinsic transpiration efficiency of approximately 46%. Some species showed considerable variation or sensitivity to environmental change, while others had much less variation. Analyses of carbon isotope discrimination is a powerful technique that can be used to select genotypes with high intrinsic transpiration efficiency or to deduce responses of plants to changes in natural conditions, including global climate change. This technique may be valuable tool for predicting the migration of tree species to new areas as climate regimes are modified due to global climate change, due to man agement practices, or a combination of both. KOSKI, M. L. and B. M. JOHNSON. Colorado State University, Fort Col lins, CO 80523, USA. Foraging ecology of kokanee salmon (Oncorhyn chus nerka): Effects of prey density and light. Bioenergetics models can provide insights about the effects of environ mental conditions on foraging behavior and trophic dynamics. Forecasting with these models requires a functional response to link predator con sumption and prey abundance. We are refining a functional response for kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) for a bioenergetics model that pre dicts how growth rates and foraging behavior of kokanee change in re sponse to shifts in prey abundance. In our laboratory experiments, finger ling kokanee were presented with varying densities of zooplankton prey (Daphnia spp.) ranging from 5 to 40 per liter. Light intensity was also manipulated to determine its relative importance to kokanee feeding rates; we used four light levels: 65, 38, 1, and &lt; 0.01 Lux (darkness). Kokanee exhibited a Type-I functional response with consumption rates varying be tween 14 and 1 10 Daphnia per minute. Consumption rates were highest at the low light level (1 Lux) indicating that kokanee forage most efficiently at lower light levels, which could be adaptive as a means of predator avoid ance while still being able to find prey visually. In addition, video analysis of feeding behavior indicated that kokanee achieved maximum consump tion rates during the first minute or two of feeding; feeding rate decreased by almost half afterwards. Hence, functional response may depend on how long the fish has been feeding in addition to prey density. Results will be used to modify a bioenergetics-based foraging model for kokanee. KOSNIK, M. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. Quanti tative analyses of late Cretaceous benthic marine communities: Spatial and temporal variation. Work extending back decades by Sohl and Koch produced taxonomically standardized and tightly age-correlated samples of marine molluscs from the Maastrichtian (Haustator bilira zone, 67-65 Ma) of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, USA. Pursuing a question first by posed by C. Koch, I reanalyzed this dataset using both taxonomic and eco-morphological clas sifications to characterize variation in mollusc diversity and abundance among assemblages and lithologies. My question was simple: Given the variation among samples collected within narrowly defined areas, could I detect statistically significant variation in species richness and composition within the much larger area stretching from Texas to New Jersey? Sampling intensity was standardized using rarefaction and multiple units of sampling (i.e., equivalent number of occurrences, samples, and/or specimens) were contrasted. All pairwise comparisons among areas were conducted and test ed against bootstrapped resampling distributions of appropriate combined area samples. Substantial and significant variation from area to area was documented. Using spatial variation in the H. bilira zone as a guide, tem poral trends in Late Cretaceous benthic marine communities are examined by comparing other Late Cretaceous faunas to the Sohl and Koch dataset. Comparing changes in taxonomic composition with changes in eco-mor phological composition suggests that eco-morphological composition is rel atively stable despite changes in taxon composition.

The hydrochemical consequence of cat astrophic windthrow in a coastal temperate rainforest, High Island, southeast Alaska. The objective of the study was to determine the influence of windthrow disturbance on the hydrochemistry of small catchments. The study was conducted on a 200 hectare forested island in the panhandle of southeast Alaska. Four watersheds (0.1 to 0.8 ha in size) with contrasting disturbance histories were selected for the study. An event based sampling scheme was then used to compare hydrochemical properties of each catchment. Nine storms were sampled over a 14 month period, representing a range of antecedant and intensity conditions. Streamflow was measured, and solu tion samples were collected every 4 hours during each storm from each catchment. Streamflow on more-disturbed catchments peaked 4 to 12 hours later than in less-disturbed catchments. During storm events, streamwater temperatures were more equilibrated to ambient air temperatures in more disturbed catchments than in less-disturbed catchments. Streams in more disturbed catchments had higher pH, bicarbonate and base cation concen trations than streams in less-disturbed catchments. These results suggest that catastrophic windthrow disturbance smoothes hydrograph response to storm events, and increases the chemical interaction of rainwater with min eral soil horizons by increasing rainwater infiltration and storage in deeper soil profiles. KRAUSS, K. W., J. A. ALLEN and R. G. HAUFF USDA Forest Service, Honolulu HI 96813 USA . The influence of seed predation and site factors on the establishment of Xylocarpus granatum, a high-value mangrove species in Micronesia. Micronesians are noted for their abilities to produce high-quality wood carvings. The most preferred wood for this economically important indus try is produced by the mangrove species, Xylocarpus granatum. X. gra natum is distributed throughout the Old World tropics, yet little is known about factors influencing its regeneration and early establishment. Here, we report on a study installed on Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia, to quantify seed predation by crabs, and survival and growth of seedlings in relation to intertidal location and light level. These are believed to be among the most important factors influencing mangrove species distribu tion. Cumulative seed predation by crabs among all locations after 34 days was 22% but was not significantly different among intertidal locations. Likewise, predation within a particular intertidal location did not differ significantly under the canopy or in the gap. Yet, establishment of seedlings at both 73 days and 161 days averaged 40% in the upper intertidal loca tions, which is where most Xylocarpus are found, and only 2.3% in middle and lower intertidal locations. This study suggests that crabs are not the major factor affecting seedling establishment among contrasting intertidal locations. However, along with data from two complementary studies, this investigation indicates that seedling establishment and early growth are influenced more by physiochemical conditions, including salinity and light, Oral Presentation Abstracts 137</page><page sequence="99">and possibly by dispersal characteristics of the seed and/or leaf herbivory on established seedlings. KREUZER, JR., M. and N. J. HUNTLY. Idaho State University, Pocatello, ID 83209, USA. Evidence for benefits to occupants of sink habitats. Although it is clear that animals depend on a variety of habitats, reasons for occupation of low-quality habitats remain controversial. We hypothesize three ways in which individuals may benefit: 1) Low-quality habitat tem porarily supports juveniles that subsequently reside in higher-quality hab itat, 2) low-quality habitat supports males that mate with female residents of nearby higher-quality areas, or 3) habitats vary in relative quality across years. We tested these hypotheses with three years of demographic data from American pika (Ochotona princeps) populations occupying different microhabitats in the Beartooth Mountains of Wyoming. The three-year av erage of adult density was slightly higher in Lush habitats, but population growth rates were much higher in Lush habitats than in Sparse habitats, and the latter appeared to be population sinks. Sink habitats contained mostly juveniles; the adult population in sinks was mostly male. Overwin ter population losses of juveniles were much higher in sinks, with a poten tially large loss to dispersal. There was no difference in the disappearance rate of adults. Body weight did not differ between habitats or with popu lation density. We found no year by habitat interaction in population den sity, birth rate, or body weight indicating that temporal heterogeneity may not be a factor. We found some support for the refuge hypothesis, and little for the satellite breeder hypothesis. Further data are needed to adequately differentiate between these three hypotheses for this population. KRUKONIS, G. P. and F M. COHAN. Wesleyan University, Middletown, CT 06459,U.S.A. The importance of allelopathy in mediating compe tition between naturally co-occurring bacterial strains. Bacterial strains from many taxa can kill or inhibit the growth of other bacterial strains. This allelopathy may occur by several mechanisms, in cluding production of primary metabolites, production of antibiotics, and the induction bacteriophage. In general individual strains are unaffected by their own inhibitory substances. The ubiquity of allelopathy has led to the suggestion that such interactions may be important in bacterial competition, but there is a paucity of data from collections of naturally sympatric iso lates. We examined the allelopathic interactions of wild isolates of Bacillus subtilis. The bacteria were collected from a small (several grams) soil sam ple, and we examined the effects of direct competition between pairs of bacterial strains in three experimental environments-petri plates, liquid cul ture, and soil microcosms. We determined the prevalence of allelopathy between stains, and measured the magnitude of the interaction. We varied the relative and absolute densities of the competing strains to determine how a numerical advantage of one strain over the other would effect the outcome and to determine to what extent the relative competitive abilities of the pair changed as the absolute densities were altered. Allelopathy was common between bacteria from our sample community, and bacterial pairs, even those with demonstrably different substrate utilization preferences, usually achieved lower total density in mixed culture than either strain attained in monoculture. Competition mediated through resource acquisi tion is not the rule for a typical pair of wild bacterial isolates. We found orders of magnitude differences in the relative densities at which two strains achieved allelopathic parity, while within pairs the superiority of the more toxic strain was often constant across a wide range of absolute starting densities. Finally, we observed numerous cases where, at equal densities, Strain A could kill Strain B, which could in turn kill Strain C, yet Strain C would kill strain A. This suggests that the outcome of com petition in natural communities may be highly dependent on initial densities of the competing strains irrespective of resource availability. KUBIEN, D. S. and R. F. SAGE. University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. Light and temperature effects on the photosynthetic charac teristics of boreal C4 and C3 grasses. The limits on the success of C4 plants in boreal climates were investigated using the grass species Muhienbergia glomerata (C4) and Calamogrostis canadensis (C3). The hypothesis that C4 plants are more susceptible to photoinhibition at low temperature than their C3 competitors was tested by assessing the effects of light and temperature on the photosynthetic char acteristics of these species using gas-exchange and fluorescence techniques. Plants were grown in controlled-environment chambers at 14/10OC or 26/ 220C. Dark-adapted Fv/Fm values were higher in the C3 species from either growth regime, with the difference being greater in the cool-grown treat ment. At a leaf temperature of l0oC, the light-saturated net CO2 assimila tion rate of the cool-grown C3 species was nearly twice that of the cool grown C4 plants, and light saturation occurred at a higher quantum flux. When plants were grown at 26/220C, the C3 species still showed higher CO2 assimilation rates at 10C, but the difference was reduced. Muhlen bergia from either growth regime showed higher assimilation than Cala mogrostis when measured at 250C. The quantum yield of PSII (+Ps.) was considerably lower when measured at 10C than at 25oC in both species. At l0oC, psII reached a minimum value at a lower irradiance in the cool grown C4 species than the C3. In contrast to earlier reports, PS11/4C02 was found to vary with temperature in the C4 species, particularly at higher irradiance. Our results indicate that photoinhibition occurs at a lower quan tum flux in the C4 species at IOOC, and thus a greater incidence of photo damage, or a greater cost of photoprotection, will be present in M. glom erata in field situations. KUCHARIK, C. J. University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. Assessing the impact of prairie restoration and agricultural land use on soil carbon dynamics in southern Wisconsin. Data collected from 1995-2000 within southern Wisconsin agroecosystems show that different land management practices (tillage and fertilization), and ecosystem type (prairie versus corn) have profound influence on soil C dynamics. Total soil C and N data were obtained (to 1 m depth) in 4 remnant and 5 restored prairies, and several corn agroecosystems to provide an improved understanding of the effects of agriculture and prairie resto ration on soil C changes across this region. Soil C density measurements were obtained within four varied corn treatments (tillage/no-tillage; fertil ized/unfertilized) at the UW-Madison Agricultural Research Station near Arlington (45 km N of Madison; plano silt loam). The data depict that all corn plots contain 40-60% of the native soil C content estimated for this region. The no-tillage corn plots contain more carbon than chisel-plow treatments, as do the fertilized plots, which are adding 1.6 times more residue back to the soil each year compared to the unfertilized treatments. The remnant prairie ecosystems contain 20-80% more soil C than restored prairies (which range in age from 2-65 years). Of particular interest is data collected within a 24-yr old restored prairie (located 2.5 km from the Ar lington corn plots on the same soil type). This ecosystem currently contains 20% and 40% less soil C than the unfertilized and fertilized corn agroe cosystems, respectively. Moreover, based on a time series of measurements from 1996-2000, the Arlington prairie lost an additional 20% of its soil C content. Moreover, its current carbon density is the lowest measured among all the ecosystems we studied. These data suggest that the restoration of this prairie has done little to replenish its soil C content over the past two decades, while the corn agroecosystems are possibly sequestering atmo spheric C. The reasoning for the prairie's additional release of carbon is unclear at this point; however, a nitrogen deficiency might be one possible hypothesis, as evident from N-min data. This poses an important question of whether or not current methods of prairie restoration, which are highly correlated to aesthetics and rehabilitating the aboveground biodiversity, are beneficial to the soil fertility while helping to mitigate the greenhouse ef fect. LADEAU, S. L., J. S. CLARK and I. IBANEZ. Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. Reproductive response of Pinus taeda in a Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment experiment. A clearer understanding of vegetative response to global carbon dioxide enrichment is critical to predicting future carbon sequestration, community composition and ecosystem regeneration. Few studies have addressed the reproductive response of non-agricultural species to elevated carbon diox ide in a forest setting, yet it is through changes in fitness that plants will respond ecologically and evolutionarily to global change. In this study re productive response is evaluated in a Pinus taeda stand in the Duke Forest FACTS-I experimental site. Three of six experimental rings maintain an atmosphere at a constant 200 ppm greater than ambient CO2 concentrations. 138 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="100">Cones were rare in this young (19 yr old) stand before CO2 treatment began, but cone production increased in treatment plots after the first year of CO2 fumigation. Trees located within elevated CO2 rings were found to have three times more cones per tree than trees in the control rings (LR test for Poisson Distribution cone abundance; p&lt;.001) and were almost twice as likely to be reproductively mature (p&lt;.001). Intervention analysis, comparing pre- and post treatment numbers of cones per tree, shows a difference over forty times greater for post treatment counts (t=4.1047,df=2,p=.055). Finally, a preliminary analysis of seeds collected from traps in each ring shows that while the total number of seeds collected per ring in 1997 and 1998 was similar for all six rings, the number of seeds collected in 1999 from treatment rings was more than twice the number of seeds collected from control rings. LAFORSCH, C. and R. TOLLRIAN. Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munchen, Germany. Cyclomorphosis in Daphnia cucullata - An adap tation against multipredator environments. Cyclomorphosis in Daphnia cucullata has attracted the attention of scien tists since the beginning of the last century. Although it is used as a text book example of phenotypic plasticity, little is known about the proximate and ultimate factors of this phenomenon. Helmets from several daphnids have been induced with Chaoborus kairomones. However small cladocer ans such as Daphnia cucullata are prey items for many invertebrate pred ators. Thus we tested the hypothesis that helmets offer protection in mul tipredator environments. Results from our induction experiments showed that chemical cues from Chaoborus flavicans, Leptodora kindtii, Cyclops sp. and Acari are proximate factors of cyclomorphosis in Daphnia cucul lata. All the above were able to induce distinctly longer helmets and longer tail spines in Daphnia cucullata. Our predation experiments revealed that the induced morphological changes offered protection against each of the predators tested. In the experiment with Leptodora kindtii, helmeted daphn ids greater than 600 jam body length were less often eaten than the typical morph. Feeding trials with Cyclops sp. has achieved that even small in duced Daphnia cucullata had a significant advantage. Direct observations of Chaoborus flavicans predation on the two different morphs indicate that there is a clear post- contact advantage for the intermediate and lager size classes of the helmeted morph. Our results imply that phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia cucullata has evolved as an adaptation against different kind of invertebrate predators. LAMONTAGNE, J. M. University of Calgary Calgary Alberta Canada. Pond selection and use by migrating trumpeter swans in Southern Al berta. Waterfowl migratory stopping areas provide energy reserves that are crit ical to subsequent success in breeding and rearing young. Trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) are considered 'at-risk' in Alberta, yet little is known of what constitutes a suitable spring migratory stopping area. I investigated spring pond use during migration in an area 60km west of Calgary, Alberta. This foothills region contains many ponds, some of which are used by trumpeter swans every spring while others are never used. My objectives were to: 1) Determine activity budgets of trumpeter swans; 2) determine habitat characteristics of ponds used by swans; and 3) determine the impact trumpeter swans have on macrophyte growth. Behaviors were measured with focal-animal techniques. I assessed habitat characteristics such as pond morphometry, macrophyte species composition, tuber density, and water chemistry. Swan impact was measured using exclosures and comparing tuber densities in the excluded versus used areas of ponds. Trumpeter swans spent &gt;50% of their time feeding and decreased tuber densities of Pota mogeton pectinatus and P. richardsonii by 1/2. Trumpeter swans used shal low areas of ponds (depth K lm), if tubers were present. Swans greatly impact those areas of ponds they use. Areas greater than lm deep that support macrophyte growth may help recolonize impacted zones, thus maintaining the food of trumpeter swans. The information gained on mi gratory habitat is important to trumpeter swan conservation and reintro duction programs, as the preservation of this species requires knowledge of habitat requirements in not only wintering and breeding areas, but also d uring spring migration. LANGLEY, A. and B. A. HUNGATE. Northern Arizona University, Flag staff, AZ 86011-5640. Carbon sink activity and nitrogen nutrition of ectomycorrhizal roots in response to elevated CO2. The roles of ectomycorrhizal associations in Florida scrub oak under ele vated CO2 were evaluated on the basis, of conventional colonization rates, as well as more innovative measures such as coarse mycorrhizal biomass, and isotopic composition. Neither EM colonization rate nor coarse mycor rhizal mass showed a consistent treatment effect over the sampling period. Isotopic analysis however revealed a trend of enhanced dependence on ectomycorrhizal roots for nitrogen uptake under elevated CO2 culminating in 86% stronger 15N tracer signal in mycorrhizal versus nonmycorrhizal roots. Under ambient conditions, mycorrhizal status had no effect on root '5N composition. These results suggest that elevated CO2 may increase plant dependence on ectomycorrhizae for nitrogen nutrition without cor responding increases in coarse EM biomass or colonization and therefore would not be detected by conventional measures. Enhanced mycorrhizal functioning could be a result of more extensive hyphal proliferation or more rapid mycorrhizal turnover, either of which could represent a globally sig nificant terrestrial carbon sink. The C:N ratio of ectomycorrhizal roots (28.8) was 60% lower than that of uninfected roots of the same diameter (72.8). Since root turnover can account for a majority of plant matter en tering the soil, subtle shifts in carbon allocation between these two distinct root types could have profound consequences for the system's nutrient cy cling rates that have been overlooked in global change research.

Top-down effects of fish predation on freshwater invertebrates are well established in pelagic zones of lakes. However, studies of fish impacts on littoral macroinvertebrates are less clear-cut, often focus only on specialists and their prey, or involve experiments of limited spatial scale or habitat complexity. We employed a whole- and multi-lake natural experiment to investigate the strength and selectivity of interactions between fish and littoral macroinvertebrates in northern Alberta lakes. In this region, cli matic, edaphic, and landscape features conspire to make fish winterkills a frequent natural disturbance. We sampled littoral macroinvertebrates in a lake before, immediately after, and 1 year following a severe winterkill of fish. If predation by fish is an important mechanism structuring the littoral fauna, winterkill should result in increased densities of invertebrates eaten by fish. Indeed, densities of amphipods and chironomids, common prey of the fishes that dominated the local assemblage (northern pike and yellow perch), increased 8-10 times following winterkill, and subsequently re turned to pre-disturbance levels when fish populations began to recover. A dramatic increase in the recruitment of metamorphs emerging from the lake was also noted in amphibians. Fish densities increased in a second lake during the same time period, and densities of invertebrate prey correspond ingly decreased. Dynamics of other, less common prey were not consis tently related to changes in fish densities. Despite high productivity and a depauperate fish fauna dominated by generalist species, we suggest that effects of winterkill in these lakes can cascade down to littoral communi ties.

Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in four North American ecosys tems: Biodiversity, spatial distribution, and effects of nitrogen fertil ization. Ectomycorrhizal fungal (ECM) communities were evaluated in four North American ecosystems under ambient and elevated nitrogen (100 kgN/ha/yr fertilization). This study compared the ECM communities associated with 3 gymnosperm (Picea glauca, Pinus edulis , Pinus resinosa ) and 2 angio sperm ( Quercus spp. , Populus balsamifera) plant symbionts. The ECM abundance, richness, and species composition were evaluated using mor phological characterization and molecular analysis. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (rDNA) of single root tips was digested and the re striction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns generated were used to differentiate between species. Environmental factors known to in Oral Presentation Abstracts 139</page><page sequence="101">fluence ECM distribution were measured for each community ((NH4, NO3, soil organic matter, pH, and soil moisture). Canonical correspondence anal ysis (CCA) was used to investigate the effects of these environmental var iables on ECM species spatial distribution. Sites did not differ significantly in the percentage of ECM root tips and there were no differences between ambient and nitrogen fertilized plots. Soil respiration at the soil surface above each ECM community differed significantly between sites. The Alas kan sites had the greatest respiration rates (22 and 18 p'mol CO2m-2s-1 for balsam poplar and white spruce, respectively) while red pine and pinyon pine had the least (0.93 and 0.17 P'mol C02m-2s-1, respectively). Soil nu trients also differed significantly between sites. Balsam poplar and oak had the most NH4 (64 ppm and 58 ppm, respectively) while red pine and pinyon pine had the least (13 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively). Balsam poplar and white spruce had the most NO3 (66 ppm and 57 ppm, respectively) while red pine and pinyon pine had the least (3 ppm and 1 ppm, respectively). Using morphological characterization we found that for each ECM com munity one or two species are dominant in abundance. The greatest diver sity of ECM species is evident when evaluating at a regional scale. Cen ococcum geophilum is present at all sites. It is present in over 80% of the communities and often comprises 25-50% of the ECM infected tips. LATTIN, J. Oregon State University Corvallis OR 97331 USA. Non-in digenous Hemiptera: Heteroptera (Insecta) in Oregon: An analysis of occurrence and habitat. Oregon has 600 known species of true bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera). For ty-nine are non-indigenous (NIS) (8.2%), representing seven families: An thocoridae (7 spp.), Cimicidae (1 sp.), Leptopodidae (1 sp.), Lygaeidae (4 spp.), Miridae (28 spp.), Nabidae (1 sp.), Reduviidae (5 spp.) and Tingidae (2 spp.). Three NIS are native to eastern North America and 46 are native outside North America. Two species of Anthocoridae were introduced de liberately (from Pakistan and India) and the others have been introduced accidentally via human activities. Twenty-six are predaceous and 23 are phytophagous. The earliest introductions occurred in the late 1700's and the process continues today. At least seven species have been detected since 1990 and three since 1998. Most NIS occur west of the Cascade Mountains, chiefly in the Willamette Valley, an area heavily impacted by agriculture and development. On the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, a 6400 ha old-growth Douglas-fir site on the west slopes of the Oregon Cascade Mountains, 211 species of Hemiptera: Heteroptera occur. Seven are NIS (3.1%) and all occur in the adjacent Willamette Valley. We still have much to learn about the impact of introduced species upon the native biota if we are to maintain the biological diversity of native organisms. LAUNDRE, J. W. 1,2 and L.

In 1999, it was reported that elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) in Yellowstone National Park responded behaviorally to the reintroduction of wolves (Canis lupus) by significantly increasing their vigilance rates. Subsequently, we investigated if wolves were also affecting habitat use patterns and diet quality of elk and bison. Habitat use was determined by counting the number of pellet groups (elk) or flops (bison) we found in 10 m2 sample plots located every 50 m from the forest edge to 500 m into the open meadow. Diet quality was assessed by measuring fecal nitrogen, phosphorous, and protein of both species. Data on habitat use and diet were collected from areas with and without wolves in 1998 and 1999. Relative to habitat use in areas with wolves, the number of elk pellet groups per 10 m2 was significantly (P = 0.001, r2 = 0.657) and negatively related to distance from the forest edge. No difference was found in the number of pellet groups per distance from edge in non-wolf areas. There was no difference for wolf nor non-wolf areas in the number of bison droppings per distance. In areas with wolves, percent fecal nitrogen (1.6 %, SE = 0.40), protein (9.8%, SE = 0.57), and phosphorus (2,097 mg/kg, SE = 258.6) were significantly less than non-wolf areas (N = 2.1 %, SE = 0.68; Protein = 13.1 %, SE = .67, P = 4,110 mg/kg, SE = 532.2). Again, no differences were seen in these parameters for bison. Habitat use results suggest, in addition to increased vigilance, elk are further responding to the landscape of fear established by wolves by shifting their habitat use patterns. Results of diet analyses further indicate this shift is to poorer quality but likely safer forage areas. It is proposed this shift in habitat use and reduction in diet quality will have significant long range impacts on the elk population as well as the vegetative communities of Yellowstone Park. Bison, however, have not responded in this manner, possibly increas ing vigilance for this species is sufficient to the lower predation risk relative to wolves. LAW, B. E., ' J. IRVINE, I S.

Carbon storage and fluxes in ponderosa pine at different successional stages. We compared carbon storage and fluxes in young and old ponderosa pine stands in Oregon, including plant and soil storage, net primary productivity, respiration fluxes, and eddy flux estimates of net ecosystem exchange. The young site (Y site) was previously an old-growth ponderosa pine forest that had been clearcut 15 years ago, and natural regeneration took place. The old-growth forest (O site) consists of two primary age classes (45 and 250 years), and in contrast, it has never been logged. Because of the logging activities at the Y site, the amount of fine- and coarse woody debris was 3 times that of the 0 site (2535 and 737 g C m2). Annual soil surface CO2 flux, estimated from periodic chamber measurements, was similar at the Y and 0 sites (714 and 702 g C m2 yD). Annual ecosystem respiration (soil, foliage, live woody tissue, woody debris) was 911 and 908 g C m2 y1 at the Y and 0 sites, and soil fluxes accounted for 78 and 77% of Re. Above ground net primary productivity (trees, shrubs, litterfall production) was lower at the Y site (177 versus 390 g C m2 y1 at the 0 site), and shrubs accounted for about 40% of the total. During the typical summer drought, eddy covariance measurements show that the old site was a stronger sink for CO2 than the young site. Predawn leaf water potential and sapflow data suggest that water availability may have been more limiting to the shallow rooted young trees. The lower ANPP and NEE at the young regenerating forest is likely the result of lower gross and net C uptake in the early successional stage (shallow root development limiting water use and C uptake, lack of canopy closure), and greater losses from decomposition relative to photosynthetic uptake. BIOME-BGC simulations of net ecosys tem productivity will be used to evaluate controls on NEP at both sites. LAWLER, S. P and D. A. DRITZ. University of California at Davis, CA. Effects of straw management and winter flooding on aquatic food web structure in a rice agroecosystem. Rice fields harbor diverse aquatic communities that are similar to temporary ponds in many respects. Recent changes in rice straw management and flooding schedules provide an opportunity for large-scale tests of how de tritus and flooding frequency affect the structure and dynamics of aquatic food webs. Traditionally, California farmers burned old rice straw, but many now incorporate it into the soil to comply with air quality regulations. Some farmers flood fields in winter to attract waterfowl and/or decay left over straw. We studied twenty 0.72 hectare rice fields that were treated as follows: burned, burned + winter flooded, straw incorporated, incorporated + flooded, straw rolled down + flooded. We predicted that detritivorous invertebrates would be more abundant in fields where straw had not been burned, and that these would support more predators. It was difficult to predict effects of winter flooding a priori, because flooding would reduce the amount and quality of detritus but might also elevate local populations of some invertebrates or provide stronger oviposition cues. Fields were sampled monthly during the growing season for invertebrates and algae. No pesticides were used on this site, but fertilizer was applied once and herbicides twice near the beginning of the growing season. Leftover detritus had surprisingly few effects on the structure of the invertebrate community, however mosquito larvae were nearly twice as abundant fields where straw was not burned. Mosquito larvae feed on algae and fine particulate organic material, so effects of straw may have been indirect. Winter flooding pro moted development of comparatively large populations of midges and pred ators. Conchostracans were less abundant in winter flooded fields. Flooding may have had negative effects on their diapausing eggs. This study shows that flooding frequency can have strong effects on aquatic food webs.

LAWRENCE, K. L. and D. H. WISE. University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546 USA. Differential responses of forest-floor arthropod pred ators and prey to long-term detrital subsidy. We investigated the impact of long-term detrital subsidy on densities of arthropod generalist predators and prey in forest-floor leaf litter. We wanted to know if an increase in the resource base would lead to persistent, uni form increases across all trophic levels; or to differential responses of major groups of predators and prey. Uniform increases would suggest that bot tom-up forces dominate in determining food web structure. Differential responses among detritivores, fungivores, and predators would indicate that top-down forces play a significant role in determining food web structure in this widespread detrital food web. Twenty plots were randomly assigned to one of four treatments in a 2x2 design: Open; Open + Detritus; Fenced; and Fenced + Detritus. We added high-quality detritus to the detritus-ad dition plots every 14 days from April to October of 1997, 1998, and 1999. Densities of all major groups of detritivores, fungivores, and generalist predators-Collembola, fungivorous Diptera, spiders, pseudoscorpions, and centipedes-increased in response to detrital enhancement within the first 4-12 months-indicating short-term, bottom-up limitation. The long-term subsidy revealed differential responses. After increasing initially, tomocerid Collembola, web-building spiders, and pseudoscorpions decreased to, or below, control levels-suggesting that long-term equilibria differ from the initial increases in density. This pattern of differential, long-term responses suggests that both bottom-up and top-down control processes contribute to trophic dynamics in this food web. LEADLEY, P. University of Paris at Orsay. Modeling plant competition for soil nutrients. Most models of nutrient competition have assumed that nutrients and roots are uniformly distributed throughout the soil. Relaxing this assumption tends to reduce competitive interactions between plants. We have been simulating nitrogen competition in semi-natural grasslands using a model of nutrient mineralization, diffusion through the soil, and uptake by roots. This work suggests that nutrient uptake kinetics and root diameter do not play an important role for ammonium or nitrate competition in these eco systems, due to diffusion limitations in the soil. Root length per unit soil volume is by far the most critical determinant of competition. Inter-specific competition is strongly reduced by the aggregation of roots of individual species, even when this aggregation occurs at millimeter scales. Agricul tural systems with annual plants where nitrogen comes predominantly from inorganic fertilizers behave very differently from semi-natural systems in which most of the nitrogen comes from mineralization of soil organic mat ter. In particular, root growth into unexplored soil plays a critical role in nutrient uptake and competition in fertile agricultural systems. These and other examples will be used to illustrate the importance of explicitly treat ing fine scale spatial heterogeneity and diffusion limitations in models of nutrient competition. LEAVITT, P.

Droughts, lakes and crop insur ance: Ecological risk assessment using mud and math. In 1988 drought-related agricultural losses exceeded $50 billion in the USA, yet crop insurance practices are based on only short-term (&lt;40 y) risk assessments. We used conditional probability analyses of fossil-recon structed lake salinity to quantify drought and flood characteristics across the northern Great Plains. Canonical analysis of fossil, climatic, agricultural and insurance data (1950-1980) demonstrated that historic wheat produc tion was significantly correlated to changes in sedimentary diatom species assemblages (r = 0.45; P &lt; 0.05). Risk assessments based on Weibull models of sub-decadal time series (AD 1000-1997) from 3 sites showed that the probability of a catastrophic drought was only 6% by 2000, but rose rapidly to 52% by 2030. Flood probabilities were higher. Spectral analyses of censored time series showed that all extreme events exhibited significant periodicities, but that cycle period differed between drought (62-82 y) and flood events (11 y). Impacts of global warming were evident as slightly increased drought frequency, but not intensity, during the 20th century, although several decades will be required before anthropogenic influences emerge statistically from background climatic variation.

Contrasting response of an N-fixing and a non-fixing forb to elevated CO2 and nitrogen: Implications for grass land community response to rising CO2. It is generally accepted that nutrient availability influences the extent of plant response to elevated CO2 concentrations. Legumes, with the ability to fix atmospheric N, may be able to alleviate the N-limitations often en countered and thought to limit plant response to elevated CO2. In a series of field (FACE) and chamber experiments, we investigated the response of the N-fixing forb, Lupinus perennis, and the non-fixing forb, Achillea mil lefolium, to elevated CO2 under varying levels of soil N. Plant growth, photosynthesis, and proportion of N derived from fixation were determined to test the following hypotheses: N-fixers show greater and more sustained responses to elevated C02, and the presence of N-fixers in plant commu nities will improve the N status and hence, the response of coexisting non fixers to elevated CO2. Both Lupinus and Achillea consistently showed a positive growth response to elevated CO2. In controlled chambers, growth responses were four times greater for Lupinus plants than for Achillea plants, whereas in the field, the magnitude of their CO2 responses were similar. Elevated CO2 decreased tissue N in both species, however the ex tent of this decrease was greater in the non-fixing Achillea (-28%). 15N methods revealed that Lupinus derived a greater proportion of its tissue N from symbiotic N2 fixation in elevated CO2 (+37%). Lupinus biomass and photosynthesis showed no response to increasing soil N, while Achillea biomass and photosynthesis increased. In both field and chamber studies, only the positive CO2 response of Achillea increased in magnitude with increasing soil N, suggesting the CO2 response was N-limited. This was also demonstrated in multi-species field plots where Achillea had higher biomass and photosynthetic rates when grown in combination with N-fixers than when grown without, consistent with the effects of N-fixers on in creasing soil N availability. Evidence suggests that the presence of N-fixers may enhance grassland community response to projected rising atmospher ic CO2 levels. LEE, C. T University of California, Davis, CA 95616, U.S.A. Ecological determinants of small-scale genetic structure in plants. Standard models of isolation-by-distance show that small-scale genetic structure at neutral loci results from restricted dispersal within continuous populations. The shape of the distribution of individuals around their par ents has largely been considered unimportant in comparison to the spatial extent of dispersal, which is measured by the variance of the distribution. Using a stochastic, individual-based simulation of a population of annual plants, I show that the shape of the dispersal distribution does affect pat terns of small-scale genetic structure under reasonable biological condi tions. Spatial autocorrelation statistics indicate that genetic structure de pends on a complex interaction between the extent of dispersal, the shape of the dispersal distribution, and the average fecundity of individuals in the population: If fecundity is high enough, the effects of changing the extent of dispersal depend on the kurtosis of the dispersal distribution. Self-in compatibility and the presence of a seed bank modify this interaction. These results suggest that the inference of dispersal parameters from pat terns of genetic relatedness is subtantially complicated by other aspects of the ecology of the species in question.

Migrations are exhibited in a wide variety of organisms from invertebrates to fish, birds, and mammals. Factors that induce these migrations across diverse taxa are surprisingly similar and are often associated with move ments across habitat gradients both in time and space. In zooplankton, migrations are primarily thought to be induced by factors such as temper ature, food, and especially predation. Damaging solar radiation may also Oral Presentation Abstracts 141</page><page sequence="103">play a role in inducing these migratory behaviors in zooplankton. Recent experiments have shown that ambient levels-of solar UV radiation (UVR) are potentially lethal to zooplankton, and negative phototactic behavior has been demonstrated in the laboratory. However, to date, no studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between UVR and zooplankton migra tion in nature. Here we present the first evidence from in situ experiments demonstrating that UVR induces diel vertical migrations under full spec trum solar radiation. Cylindrical acrylic columns that transmitted or blocked UVR were used to examine the vertical migration patterns of Daphnia . Experiments were conducted in the surface waters of a high UV system at midday and in late afternoon. In both experiments, a large pro portion of individuals migrated downward in the presence of UVR while those in the UVR-shielded treatments tended to remain closer to the sur face. LEIBOLD, M.

Effects of grazers on the correlations between plant traits and habitat variables in ponds. Patterns of (co-)variation in the ecological traits of species in a species pool are important because these patterns generate the trade-offs that might regulate the outcome of the interactions in different local habitats. Theory based on this idea of trade-offs involving predator-mediated resource com petition (i.e. keystone predation) predicts that the distribution of species with different traits along resource gradients will be altered by the presence of higher trophic levels. We examined how correlations between algal plant traits and ambient nutrient levels in the habitat were altered by the presence of zooplankton grazers in experimental pond mesocosms in which nutrient levels were manipulated. We found that grazers qualitatively changed the correlation structure between plant traits and habitat variables. We also measured the same set of correlations in natural ponds and compared it to each of these two experimental situations. We found that the correlation matrix in natural ponds resembled the one we saw when grazers were present but did not resemble the one we saw in the absence of grazers. These results indicate that grazers are a key element determining how algal plants sort out along nutrient gradients in ponds. This is consistent with models of predator-mediated resource competition that predict that many of the important effects of resource supply to a food web will occur as a consequence of indirect effects on higher trophic levels.

Spatially scaled response of a Lazuli Bunting population to fire: Further evidence for hierarchical habitat selection in birds. We examined the response of Lazuli Bunting (Passerina amoena) to fire in Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) woodland at Camp Williams, Utah, during 1993-1998. Overall, Lazuli Bunting abundance on the study area increased significantly during 2 years after stand-replacing wildfire cover ing 800 ha of Gambel oak woodland, suggesting a positive response of Lazuli Bunting to fire. However, a comparison of pre- and post-fire abun dance of Lazuli Bunting for 2 groups of monitoring plots with different fire histories showed that abundance was significantly greater during the post-fire period for both burned and unburned plots. When viewed at a spatial scale appropriate to Lazuli Bunting, we found that post-fire increases observed on unburned plots were limited to plots in close proximity to the burned area. A comparison of pre- and post-fire abundance of Lazuli Bun ting for 3 groups of monitoring plots located at various distances from the burned area revealed that post-fire abundance was similar only for plots in the burned area and those &lt; = 1,000 m from the burn; plots located &gt; 1,000 m from the burn had fewer individuals/plot post-fire. However, pre fire Lazuli Bunting abundance was similar among all 3 categories. This spatially scaled response of Lazuli Bunting to fire at the landscape level supports a hierarchical view of habitat selection. Whether recent post-fire habitats are preferred over unburned habitats by Lazuli Bunting at the scale of individual territories is yet unclear. LENIHAN, H. UNC-Chapel Hill, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA. How heterogeneity at different spatial scales controls community composi tion and dynamics in restored estuarine habitats. Habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales is likely to significantly influence community structure and dynamics in different ways. Understand ing how various habitat types distributed across seascapes in different com binations influences associated species is fundamental to conserving and restoring exploited marine populations. I tested how species richness and predatory-prey interactions among estuarine fish assemblages and benthic invertebrate prey varied with changes in small-scale structural complexity and large-scale seascape heterogeneity. Restored estuarine habitats of vary ing structural complexity (oyster reefs, artificial reefs, and seagrass beds) were placed in different spatial combinations (i.e, varying degrees of sea scape heterogeneity: single habitats, paired habitats, and in triplet combi nation) within a North Carolina estuary and sampled for the abundance of fish and benthic crustacean populations through time using various sam pling methods. Both habitat and seascape complexity had strong influences on species richness and the intensity of predation. The species richness of both fish (predators) and invertebrate prey increased with habitat and sea scape heterogeneity. In contrast, the total abundance of most predators de creased with habitat heterogeneity apparently in response to variation in prey density that was driven by a few key predators and variable recruit ment. The total abundance of most fishes was greatest at the highest level of seascape heterogeneity. Results from this experiment indicate that in creasing the heterogeneity of restored habitat at different spatial scales is likely to have important impacts on communities composition and dynam ics of exploited marine species.

Community resistance to an invasion attempt by Daphnia lum holtzi. Although biological invasions are becoming increasingly more common, a majority of introduced exotic species fail to establish viable populations in new environments. Current ecological research suggests that invasion suc cess can be influenced by "biological resistance", which is determined by the native community structure. We examined the effects of biological re sistance on the recent invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi, by introducing this exotic species into native zooplankton communities in a series of experi mental mesocosms exposed to a strong nutrient gradient. We hypothesized that nutrient enrichment, zooplankton production, and zooplankton species diversity would influence the success of a one-time invasion attempt by D. lumholtzi. Nutrient enrichment lead to significant increases in zooplankton biomass and also resulted in a significant decline in zooplankton species diversity. However, the invasion success of D. lumholtzi was not directly influenced by nutrient enrichment. Instead, the invasion success of D. lum holtzi appeared to be most strongly influenced by the presence and abun dance of the littoral zooplankton species, Chydorus sphaericus in the water column. These results suggest that species- or functional-identity may be an aspect of community structure that influences the invasion success of introduced D. lumholtzi. LEON, B. F Ecological Services, Brown &amp; Root, Houston, TX 77001 USA. A model for automatic species keying. Ecologists are traditional clients of taxonomists for the names, categories and the very definitions of species. Each taxonomist develops a dichoto mous key for identifying members of the genus or family in which he or she is interested, but these are often difficult for the ecologist to use. A framework is presented for an automatic keying system based on a database of species attributes and a keying engine that generates new steps based on responses to previous steps. The keying engine would use object-ori ented programming to create keying steps, each showing the user a species characteristic ("flower color" for example) and several potential attributes ("red", "blue", etc.). The user would then examine the organism and select among the choice of attributes, which would then narrow the range of species matches and drive the next step of the key. The database would potentially contain as many attributes of as many species as can be entered, which is more of a challenge to taxonomic science than to computer sci ence. Populating the database would create a new library of species infor mation that could have many applications. 142 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="104">LEON CORTES, J. L.,' M. J. R.

Current fine population and habitat data, determined from over 2000 tran sect counts, combined with data on historical (1901) and present-day hab itat distributions in a 35km2 of fragmented North Wales, UK, reveal that the population-level decline of two widespread butterfly species (Polyom matus icarus and Lycaena phlaeas) are likely to be of the order of 75 and 89% respectively. Similar data on the butterflies' major host plants (Lotus corniculatus for P. icarus, and Rumex acetosa and R. acetosella for L. phlaeas) indicate possible declines in area occupied of 50, 48 and 91%. Based on 1km2 grid maps, neither P. icarus and L. cornitulatus have been assessed as declining at all, and if L. phlaeas, R. acetosa, and R. acetosella had occupied all lkm2 in the study area in 1901, their declines would only have been recorded as 15, 9, and 35% respectively. The results presented here suggest that apparently "common" widespread butterfly species may have declined as much as many of Britain's rarities: using present methods of assessment these declines are undetected.

Composition, structure, dynamics, biomass and climate of Eocene fossil forests, Ca nadian High Arctic. Remarkable preservation of 45 million-year-old forests on Axel Heiberg Island, Canadian High Arctic allows the use of standard field measurements to determine forest composition, architecture, dynamics, and biomass. The taxonomy and systematics of this middle Eocene flora has been studied for a dozen years, but the basic ecological attributes of these forests and the climate under which they grew were poorly understood. Stumps, boles, litter, roots, seeds and soils are preserved as intact, in situ, mummified remains and provide a unique opportunity to reconstruct aspects of this ancient ecosystem from field measurements. The productivity, stem volume and biomass for a 2227 m2 area of the fossil forest were previously esti mated to be ca. 1200 gm/m2/yr, 946.1 m3/ha and 255 Mg/ha respectively. These estimates are comparable to temperate old-growth forests. In addi tion, the forest canopy was inferred to be open with its height estimated to be ca. 16 m. The results of our study indicate that the forest was a minimum of 33 m tall, closed canopy, with stem volume of 2190 m3/ha and a stem biomass of 591 Mg/ha. The growth strategy of these fossil Metasequoia-dominated forests is consistent with that of modem planta tion-grown Metasequoia forests in Japan. Carbon isotopic analyses were performed on a number of Metasequoia individuals and on paleosol organic matter from every plant-bearing horizon exposed at the fossil forest local ity. The 8 '3C for fossil Metasequoia ranged from -20.5 to -23 %C and indicates that the tissues were isotopically homogenous. Moreover, the fos sil 8 '3C values are high compared to ca. -25 %c seen in extant Metasequoia. The 8 '3C of the middle Eocene atmosphere was quantitatively assessed to be ca. -5.5 %o, which allowed calculation of the ratio of intracellular (P) to ambient (Pa) carbon dioxide concentrations for fossil (P/Pa = 0.47 - 0.56) and extant (0.56) Metasequoia. The values seen in the fossil Meta sequoia suggest a higher water use efficiency for the genus relative to that seen in extant Metasequoia. LETOURNEAU, D. K.

Clearly, many factors interact to determine the success of a novel plant at a given introduction site and time of introduction, including abiotic factors, the abundance and identities of mutualists, competitors, herbivores, etc. The context of this paper is current and future deployment of transgenic crops with resistance traits against herbivores, the possible movement of these traits to relatives of crop plants, and the potential to shift the balance of plant traits in a particular environment towards invasiveness. I report the results of field and laboratory experiments to assess the potential impacts of a gene transfer from Bt crops (specifically, Brassica oleracea) to weedy relatives by using Bacillus thuringiensis sprays to mimic the constitutive expression of the Bt anti-herbivore trait in wild plants. First, the likelihood of gene transfer was assessed from the literature on Brassica crops and related weeds. Second, local herbivore levels were monitored in the field. Third, laboratory experiments showed no significant effects of Bt alone on seed output of plants but a significant decrease in herbivory and a signif icant increase in seed production in Brassica nigra sprayed with Bt com pared to control plants. The results suggest significant changes are required in the context of better-informed practical decisions for the deployment of new transgenic crops. LEVINE, J. M. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA. Spe cies diversity and biological invasions: Relating local process to com munity pattern. Concerns over biodiversity loss and the impacts of exotic species on natural ecosystems have rekindled interest in the relationship between species di versity and community susceptibility to biological invasions. I investigated both the community-wide patterns of diversity and invasion, and the in trinsic neighborhood scale effects of diversity in a California riparian sys tem. In a survey of a 7 km stretch of the South Fork Eel River plant community, I found that the three most common exotic plants more fre quently invaded diverse versus species poor areas. Yet a direct in situ ma nipulation of local diversity showed that the intrinsic effects of diversity are to enhance invasion resistance in this system. This apparent contradic tion is resolved by recognizing that neighborhood scale effects of diversity can be overwhelmed by ecological factors spatially covarying with diver sity at community wide scales. An additional seed addition experiment suggested that for this system, seed supply drives patterns of diversity and invasion. Results suggest that species loss at small scales may reduce in vasion resistance. Yet at community-wide scales, the overwhelming effects of ecological factors spatially covarying with diversity, such as propagule supply, cause the most diverse natural communities to be most susceptible to invasion. LEVY, E. T. and P. M. VITOUSEK. Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. Effects of introduced trees on soils in a Hawaiian montane rainforest. We evaluated a series of monospecific tree stands planted in the 1930's on the island of Hawai'i to test how 14 different tree species affect soil prop erties. The tree stands are planted on the same substrate with similar cli mate, so any differences between plots can likely be attributed to tree species. Nitrogen fixing trees had N concentrations in litterfall more than two times greater than any other species resulting in a significant increase in net nitrification rates in soils under N-fixers. The concentration of N in litterfall was a better predictor of net nitrification rates (R2 = 0.475) than pH (R2 = 0.064). Native forests had significantly greater plant available nitrogen than all introduced species, which may result from immobilization of N in the biomass of fast-growing introduced trees, or greater leaching of N in the low-diversity tree plantations. We also analyzed Sr isotopic composition of leaf samples to differentiate between trees in their ability to obtain nutrients from depth. Access to rock-derived pools of nutrients deep in the soil may be particularly important in highly weathered tropical ecosystems where the supply of phosphorus or base cations often limit growth.

Effects of nutrient limitation, light limitation, and invertebrate grazers on phytoplankton living in deep chlorophyll layers. Our study addressed factors controlling deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) that occur in unproductive lakes and oceans. These chlorophyll peaks rep resent communities of phytoplankton living in deep, poorly-lit strata below the surface mixed layer and can be responsible for greater than 50% of lake primary production. The importance of nutrient limitation, light lim itation, and herbivore grazing/recycling for the formation and maintenance of DCM were studied in two Sawtooth Mountain lakes of Idaho using microcosm experiments and physiological nutrient deficiency indicators. Oral Presentation Abstracts 143</page><page sequence="105">For Yellow Belly Lake, the results of the microcosm experiments show nitrogen limitation early in the summer growing season for the epilimnetic strata. As the summer progressed, co-limitation by nitrogen and phosphorus developed for both the epilimnion and metalimnion. Zooplankton, present at extremely high biomass due to low fish densities, had negative impacts, decreasing growth rate as compared to controls by a factor of up to six. In Stanley Lake, microcosm results show spatial and temporal variation be tween N and P as limiting nutrients in the surface layer. Phosphorus inhi bition was observed at depths of 9-12m. Zooplankton had both positive and negative effects on growth rate depending on density. Stanley Lake, with its large fish population, has much lower zooplankton densities re sulting in lower grazing pressures for phytoplankton. The nutrient defi ciency indicators documented the variability in nutrient limitation in both lakes as well. The microcosm experiments also demonstrated that phyto plankton living at low light intensity were adjusted to these light conditions because providing them with more light resulted in growth rates up to 36 times lower than controls.

Antipredator behavior of the cave cricket (Hadenoecus subterraneus) in response to predation risk by white-foot ed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). The cave cricket (Hadenoecus subterraneus) feeding in its natural habitat has been effectively used as a model system to investigate foraging strat egies of crickets under the influence of predation risk and in response to other features of their abiotic and biotic environment. We qualitatively mea sured cricket foraging responses using color-coded baits positioned at in creasing distance from cave entrances where crickets exit to forage on the surface, and quantitatively using the technique of giving-up fullness (GUF). The GUF represents the percent amount of food consumed by a cricket relative to its crop-empty live weight. We hypothesized that the degree to which crickets 'fill up' is proportional to their foraging costs, e.g., meta bolic costs and predation risk. To test our hypotheses that crickets can assess and respond to the risk of predation from white-footed mice around cave entrances, we used a combination of GUF and tethering experiments. We tethered crickets outside three cave entrances to determine variation in predation rates among caves and variability in predation as a function of distance from a cave entrance. At the same time, GUFs were collected at distances of 0, 5, and 15m from entrances (distances identified by color coded food). While our analysis showed cave entrance had a significant effect on GUFs (ANOVA, F2 1036 = 3.25, P = .039), contrary to our pre dictions GUFs were highest (i.e. foraging costs lowest) at caves with the highest predation rates on tethered crickets. Though GUFs increased from 0 to Sm, consistent with our hypothesis of high density-dependent predation risk just outside cave entrances, predation rates on tethered crickets were not correlated with distance from cave entrances. Our data suggest crickets may not be responding primarily to the risk of predation while foraging outside of cave entrances. An alternative hypothesis is that resource com petition is driving cricket behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found: 1) A negative correlation between GUFs and the number of crickets feeding at our bait patches; and 2) shifts in habitat use (distance from entrance) as a function of the number of feeding crickets. Future studies will be directed at multiple explanations of cricket behavior. LEWIS, D. and R. E DENNO. University of Maryland, College Park, MD, U.S.A. Effects of tidal inundation on the distribution of wolf spiders in an intertidal salt marsh. The wolf spider Pardosa littoralis is an important predator of herbivorous insects in salt marshes along the atlantic coast of the United States. Pre vious studies have shown that wolf spider density decreases with decreas ing marsh elevation, contributing to outbreaks of the planthopper Prokelisia marginata, its primary prey in low marsh habitats. Habitat structure also changes with marsh elevation. Vegetation in the low marsh is taller with culms more widely spaced than grass at higher elevations. Thatch is absent from the low marsh but increases with elevation. This study tested whether tidal inundation and vegetation structure contribute to the rarity of wolf spiders in the low marsh. Spider response to incoming tides was tested in floodable microcosms configured as an inclined plane to simulate high and low marsh habitats with and without thatch. In a typical low marsh habitat without thatch, inundation forced roughly half the released spiders to em igrate from the "low-marsh habitat" for higher ground. Adding thatch to the "low-marsh habitat" enhances the retention of some spiders in this habitat because they gain refuge from rising tides by climbing grass culms. Virtually all spiders remained in the simulated high-marsh habitat as tide waters rose. These results are consistent with the view that frequent tidal inundation tends to selectively uncouple predator-prey interactions in low marsh habitats and promote planthopper outbreaks there. LEY, R. E. and S. K. SCHMIDT University of Colorado, Boulder CO 80309 USA. Seasonal trends in microbial biomass and the microcli mate of high elevation (3750m) unvegetated talus soils. The severe climate of high elevation rocky talus slopes results in unvege tated soils that are extreme environments for life. Unlike polar soils, they are undescribed by ecologists. As a first description of microbial ecology in this type of extreme environment, we report temporal changes in the physical and microbial attributes of a talus soil (3750 m) in the Colorado Rocky Mountains over three years (1997-2000). We measured soil mois ture and temperature with a datalogger, and the total microbial biomass and the biomass of salicylate mineralizing microbes using the substrate-induced growth response (SIGR) assay. We assayed the groups at 3 ?C and 22 ?C to differentiate between cold- and warm-adapted microbes. Three distinct periods describe the microclimate: 1) a frozen period under snow (Oct May, T=-1.3 ?C, free H20= 4%); 2) a thawed period under snow (May Aug, T= 0 ?C, free H20= 24%, due to melting snow); and 3) an exposed period without snow cover (Aug-Oct, T=5-30 ?C, free H20= 10%-15%, in response to rain). The cold-adapted total biomass peaked when soils were thawed under snow (6.5 ug C g-1 soil) and exposed (6 ug C g-' soil), and were lowest when soils were frozen under snow (1.15 ug C g-1 soil). In contrast the cold-adapted salicylate mineralizers peaked during the fro zen period (0.08 ug C g-1soil), and declined when soils thawed (0.006 ug C g-1soil). Both warm-adapted groups (total biomass and salicylate min eralizers) peaked when soils were exposed. This novel study reveals a surprisingly complex microbial community where seasonal fluctuations in biomass vary by functional group. LI, B. University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA. Fractals in ecology: Where is the ecology? A log-log plot of ecological data has the great property of displaying, more often than not, a straight line over a certain range of parameters. There is a widely spread tendency to look for simple, ideal explanation; one often interprets a straight line as a scaling law (or scale invariance) reflecting some important information. In this paper, I will analytically demonstrate how deeply misleading this quest for simple interpretation can be. I will show that many different things can produce a power-law distribution. In many cases, there is no single ecological mechanism behind the scale in variance. The distributions which are usually classified as power-law may actually correspond to stretched exponential ones. Using Sevilleta LTER data, I argue that the departures from the power-law should not necessarily be explained by the finite size of the data set, but could result from a deeper departure from the power-law hypothesis. I also argue that current fractal approach is inconsistent with ecological hierarchy theory because of no existence of a hierarchy of characteristic scales in space/time and all scales treated as playing the same role. Ecologically, spatiotemporal scales give us access to additional information and clues about the underlying pro cesses and the existence of a hierarchy of preferred scales; discrete-scale invariance and scale covariance should be applied. Studies of fractals in ecology have now evolved from descriptive to the beginning of understand ing. LIGHTFOOT, D. C.l and L. F.

The effects of livestock grazing and cli mate variation on vegetation and grasshoppers in the northern Chi huahuan Desert. Domestic livestock grazing on semi-arid rangelands of the American South west represents an ecological perturbation with a long history of changes 144 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="106">in biotic communities. Reduction of native perennial grasses and increases in weedy annual herb and perennial shrub plant species are well docu mented on historically grazed semi-arid Western rangelands. Variation in climate has also produced considerable impacts on Southwestern ecosys tems, such as the 1950's drought, and a recent trend toward a wetter and warmer climate. The interactive effects of livestock grazing and climate fluctuation on biotic communities are not well understood. Grasshoppers are important native herbivores on western rangelands, and climate is known to be a key factor controlling their populations. We measured veg etation and grasshoppers for five years at a series of five semi-arid sites in New Mexico, to assess the interactive effects of livestock grazing and short term climate variation on plant and grasshopper community structure and population dynamics. Our five study sites ranged from shrub to grass dom inated. The five-year study period included both wet El Nino and dry La Nina climatic events. Our results demonstrate that livestock grazing 1) Alters plant and grasshopper species composition and population dynamics, 2) favors weedy species, and 3) affects both grass and shrub dominated communities in similar ways. Variation in precipitation patterns increased the amplitude of ecological grazing impacts favoring weedy species in wet years on grazed lands. Annual plants and ground-dwelling grasshoppers were significantly more abundant on grazed land, and correlated with pre cipitation over time. Perennial grasses and grass-dwelling grasshoppers were significantly greater on non-grazed land, and correlated less to vari ation in rainfall over time. These findings indicate that domestic livestock grazing reduces the stability of semi-arid ecosystems. LILIEHOLM, R. J., S. WHITESELL and T. L. SHARIK. Utah State Uni versity, Logan, UT 84322-5215 USA. A global survey of tropical bio logical field stations. Biological field stations (BFS) are typically remote sites supporting basic and applied research on natural, unmanaged ecosystems. BFS range from tent camps to state-of-the-art facilities, and may support biological, physical and social research, as well as educational activities. The important role that BFS serve in discovery, integration and training places them at the forefront of efforts to understand and protect the world's significant eco systems. This is particularly true for the tropics, estimated to contain half the world's species. To determine the status and trends of BFS, a postal survey was sent to all known stations in the Tropics. The survey requested information on: 1) General station characteristics; 2) research and training activities; and 3) finances. Use of Dillman's Total Design Method resulted in a 60% response rate (66 stations in 33 countries). The survey found that BFS offer a wide range of facilities and services, and support research, education and training for a myriad of scientific disciplines. BFS also pro vide access to diverse ecosystems that are often listed under formal pro tection status. Stations cited many challenges, including financial limita tions. Indeed, nearly half of BFS budgets were undependable from year to-year and had to be self-generated. Moreover, 25% of field stations re ported that significant local ecosystems were unstudied due to inadequate funding. Enhancing the effectiveness of BFS requires efforts to raise aware ness within the scientific community and among policy analysts. The cre ation and support of a global association of BFS would represent an im portant first step in meeting this challenge. LILL, J. T. and R. J. MARQUIS. University of Missouri-St. Louis, MO. Ecosystem engineering by leaftying caterpillars. In addition to their trophic and competitive effects, shelter-building cater pillars can act as physical ecosystem engineers on their host plants by creating habitats that are subsequently colonized by an array of other or ganisms. We hypothesize that these engineering effects will influence the diversity and abundance of future arthropod colonists, as well as the amount of leaf damage experienced by their host plant. In Missouri, ap proximately fifteen species of leaftying caterpillars are found on white oak (Quercus alba). One species in the genus Pseudoteiphusa may act as a "keystone" engineer, in that it creates the first wave of leafties in the early summer that are then preferentially colonized by the remaining species. In order to examine the engineering effect of Pseudoteiphusa, we conducted a field experiment in the summer of 1999 in which we manipulated the density of leafties on individual white oak saplings and observed the effects on (l) the abundance and composition of the arthropod community, and (2) the amount of leaf damage accrued throughout the season. In order to separate the caterpillar's engineering effects from its trophic/competitive effects, we created artificial leafties both with and without caterpillars ini tially present. Compared to controls, the treatments in which we clipped 10% of the leaves into leafties had twice the number of total arthropods one month post-treatment. This pattern was largely due to recruitment of other leaftying caterpillars to trees containing artificial ties. Furthermore, recruitment by leaftying caterpillars to artificial ties initially containing a single Pseudotelphusa larva was double that of initially empty ties, indi cating a strong biotic effect (i.e., a colonization cue, such as damage, frass or feeding-related volatiles). This increased recruitment in the + caterpillar treatment resulted in a significant increase in foliar herbivory. Other ar thropod guilds (predators, sucking insects) showed no response to the treat ments or had a delayed response that was only detected later in the season. LIMBURG, K. E. SUNY, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA. Long-distance fish migration: More than a matter of getting from here to there. Long-distance fish migration is a spectacular example of the ontogenetic niche shift. Our general perception of these migrations tends toward overly simplistic descriptions, due in part to the impracticality of direct observa tion, and to the imperfect information derived from tagging studies. I dis cuss here how relatively new techniques, which exploit the microchemical properties of otoliths (fish earstones), provide detailed information on in dividual migrating fish. In particular, I show how strontium incorporated into otoliths can serve as a proxy for salinity; how it can be used to study the movements of diadromous fishes (fresh water Sr:Ca range 0.5-1.5; marine waters, Sr:Ca range 3-6); and how this provides a much more complex picture of migration. For example, European freshwater eels en gage in a wide repertoire of movements, often moving between marine and brackish waters without entering fresh water (65% of the time in an on going study). Blueback herring in the Hudson/Mohawk drainage not only show classic anadromous patterns, but also a new behavior due to presence of canals and locks: occasional to complete freshwater residency. These empirical observations place a new demand on ecological theory to explain the rich repertoires of large-scale habitat switching increasingly revealed by natural chemical tracers. LIN, J.,1 P A.

Growth in high light vs. survival in low light as a key tradeoff that determines shade tolerance: A test in a mesic forest in southeast Texas. For seven species in a mature mesic forest in southeast Texas, we estimated species-specific parameters representing radial growth in high light and sensitivity of growth to low light for tree saplings of different species. We also used survival analysis to characterize survival-growth relationships using a demographic dataset collected over 15 years. Shade-intolerant spe cies had higher asymptotic growth rates and lower sensitivity of growth to increasing light than tolerant species. They had lower growth at low light than did the shade-tolerant species. They also had a higher mortality risk at zero growth (low light) and stronger sensitivity of mortality to increasing growth (and light) than shade-tolerant species. Inspection of species posi tions on graphs of low-light performance (either survival or growth) vs high-light radial growth rate suggests that the tradeoff of low-light growth vs. high-light growth is more evident than the tradeoff of low-light survival vs high-light growth among the important species in this forest, in contrast to results from northern forests. One possible explanation is that the south ern forest is brighter than northern forests, so all species may be able to maintain a positive carbon budget. Therefore, in at least some circumstanc es, survival may not be as important in determining future success in tree saplings as growth. LIN, T., ' S. P. HAMBURG2 and H.

Light levels beneath the canopy (&gt; 5% of that in the open) were substantially higher than that reported for many tropical and temperate forests. Defoliation associated with the frequent typhoons played a critical role on the dynamics of un dercanopy light environments. Mean undercanopy light levels were 40% of that in the open after typhoon passage. Seedlings of canopy tree species did not occupy microsites with higher light levels than the random back ground light levels. Light did not seem to limit seedling distribution in the studied forest. Gaps in the studied forest tended to be small relative to many wind damaged forests. Light levels did not differ significantly be tween gaps and the frequently defoliated undercanopy. The forest probably does not depend on gaps for regeneration. Typhoon disturbance damaged individual trees but there was no sign of differential damages among tree species. Because typhoons occur very often, the forest is continuously dis turbed and in recovery. Typhoons may act, therefore, like a stablizing force, keeping the forest in a dynamic equilibrium state.

This presentation describes a three-year project which introduces beginning biology students to quantitative exercises in biology labs. The purpose is to increase confidence in devising mathematical models to solve problems. Retention of these skills is traced in the upper division biology classes, including ecology. Pre- and posttests are administered. The increase in scores for individual math skills was between 1.2% and 37%. The ability to solve a problem using a modeling approach increased from 11% at the beginning of the semester to 66% by the end. We describe the analysis of videotapes of student and teaching assistant behaviors during the biomath labs. Student involvement in the biomath labs are compared to the student responses in the more descriptive typical laboratory exercises. The best overall predictor of student success was the interest and involvement of the teaching assistant. Successful strategies for teaching applied math to students with weak backgrounds are discussed. LINDROTH, R. L., B. J. KOPPER and C. S. AWMACK. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA. Consequences of enriched CO2 and 03 for forest insects. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2, both alone and in combination with other pollutants such as 03, have been shown to alter interactions between trees and tree-feeding insects. Previous studies indicated that chewing in sects may be adversely affected by changes in plant quality, whereas sap feeding insects may benefit. Most of these studies, however, have been conducted in controlled environments. We investigated the effects of en riched CO2 and 03 on performance of aspen blotch leafminers (Phyllono rycter tremuloidiella) and aphids (Chaitophorus stevensis) at a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) site in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. Rates of leaf colonization by leafminers declined in all elevated CO2 or 03 treatments. The pollutants had relatively small effects on leafminer performance (de velopment, pupal weight), however, with the largest impacts deriving from combined CO2 and 03. With respect to aphids, pollutant treatment had no discernible effects on development time, fecundity, or intrinsic rate of in crease, but did influence adult weight (highest at elevated C02) and embryo number (highest at ambient C02). Variation in aphid population densities among treatments appeared to be related to differential impact of the pol lutants on natural enemy complexes. LINK, J. S. and S. J. WHIPPLE. National Marine Fisheries Service, Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA. A general model of selectivity for fish feeding: A rank proportion algorithm. Predator-prey interactions can ultimately determine the fate and flux of every population in an ecosystem, particularly upper level consumers of fiscal importance. Thus, the impacts and dynamics of fish feeding have implications for nearly every aquatic ecosystem. Given that varying prey are available to fish in a particular ecosystem, by default fish feed selec tively. Studies of fish feeding ecology have provided key insights into the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, yet diet selectivity is the least addressed component of these studies. This may be due to the higher level of effort associated with examining both the stomach contents and ambient prey abundance, the assumption that a determined diet composition is static, or the lack of a predictive protocol for a priori estimates of selectivity/com position. We present a rank proportion algorithm (RPA) that predicts diet composition from ambient prey concentrations and first principles of pre dation. We applied our model for benthivore, planktivore, and piscivore examples from lentic, lotic, estuartine, and marine ecosystems. Validating RPA model predictions of diet composition with observed stomach con tents exhibits &gt;90% model accuracy. Bayesian resampling statistics showed the model results were significantly different than random assign ment of ranks. Our results suggest that the RPA may be a useful tool to apply when stomach composition data is limited but required for other applications, and a general knowledge of the predation process may be useful to obtain quantitative information of fish diet. LINTON, M. J. and L. A. DONOVAN. University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602 USA . Disequilibrium between plant and soil water potential at predawn: The contribution of nighttime transpiration. Measurements of plant predawn water potential are often used as an index to indicate the water-stress level of a plant and for comparing plant water availability in different habitats. Such use of plant predawn water potential is based on the assumption that, during the night, the water potential of a plant equilibrates with that of the soil. Recent research in our laboratory has indicated that this equilibration does not occur for the two desert shrubs, Chrysothamnus nauseosus and Sarcobatus vermiculatus. This dis equilibrium for plants growing in soil at field capacity ranges from 1.0 1.3 MPa for C. nauseosus and 1.5-1.8 MPa for S. vermiculatus. Our study of diurnal leaf gas exchange indicates that nighttime transpiration is par tially responsible for this disequilibrium. When nighttime transpiration is artificially eliminated (via overnight bagging of plants), the predawn water potentials of C. nauseosus are -0.87 + 0.11 MPa (mean ? SD), compared to -1.03 + 0.13 MPa for untreated plants. The corresponding values for S. vermiculatus are -0.87 + 0.21 MPa and -1.52 + 0.55 MPa. The amount of water loss due to nighttime transpiration constitutes a significant fraction of the total daily water loss, equaling 42% for C. nauseosus and 36% for S. vermiculatus. We continue to study the various conditions that contribute to predawn disequilibrium but, with regards to nighttime transpiration, our research suggests that it has adverse effects on plant water status and, possibly, ecological fitness.

Changes in alpine soil microbial function and spe cies composition during spring snowmelt. High levels of soil microbial biomass are found under snowpacks in the dry meadow communities of the Colorado alpine. During late spring when the snow pack melts, soil microbial biomass declines. Previous work showed that the decline of microbial biomass in the spring is caused by changes in temperature and carbon availability. We tested the hypothesis that the summer and winter microbial communities differ in function and species composition. Shifts in species composition between pre- and post snowmelt communities were detected using reciprocal hybridization of community DNA. Replicate soil samples were collected from a dry mead ow before and after snowmelt. DNA extracted from soils sampled at dif ferent times was significantly less homologous relative to spatial replicates sampled at the same time. To address functional changes we measured the size of various microbial functional groups throughout the year using sub strate-induced growth response (SIGR) and most probable number (MPN) techniques. The microbial biomass showed different preferences for sub strate use between winter and summer. The phenolic compounds, salicylate and vanillate, were used by a disproportionately higher group during the winter months. Also, the soil microbial biomass responded differently to temperature in winter and summer. The winter biomass contained a com ponent that grew at 3 degrees C but not at 22 degrees C. Use of bacterial and fungal inhibitors showed that the biomass that responded to substrate input in the winter was predominantly fungi, while in the summer bacteria and fungi both responded. From these results we conclude that the summer and winter soil microbial communities contain different assemblages of organisms that react differently to substrate and temperature. 146 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="108">LITAOR, M., I T.

Spatial analysis of selected soil attributes across an alpine topographic/snow gradient. The role of the topographic/snow gradient on alpine soil processes of the Colorado Front Range was assessed using geostatistical modeling and frac tal approach. The mean snow depth, measured between 1984 and 1997 exhibited a smooth spatial continuity across the study grid area (550 by 400 meter). Soil color variables (CIE L*, a*, b*) showed a nested structure that was attributed to a confounded effect of catenary processes, dominant plant species and eolian deposition. The spatial structure of texture classes exhibited limited spatial structure and was partially explained by data spar sity and crytorbation processes that mask the expected long-distance vari ations (i.e., 550-m) of the catenary processes. Organic C, pH, bulk density and soil moisture content showed various degrees of spatial continuity but all indicated that the topographic/snow gradient is not the only dominating soil forming factor in this alpine ecosystem. The estimated fractal dimen sion D for the Saddle grid landform and the mean snow depth varied between 1.2 to 1.4 indicating that they vary smoothly with long-range variation. The estimated D of the soil variables ranged between 1.6 to 1.8 showing noisy appearance with short-range variations. These results firmly imply that most of the spatial variations exhibited by the alpine soil attri butes resulted from the combined effect of relief, cryoturbation, biological activity and eolian deposition. LLOYD, J. D. and J. J. TEWKSBURY. Univ. of Montana, Missoula, MT 59812, USA. Positive interactions under nurse-plants: Spatial scale, stress gradients and benefactor size. Studies examining facilitation in plant communities have typically focused on a single factor that may influence interactions, although the importance of positive interactions may be determined by a number of potentially interactive factors. Moreover, how the local influence of facilitation affects broader scale patterms of species distribution and abundance remains un known. We examine how moisture stress and canopy size influence the role of a dominant desert tree species, Olneya tesota in structuring plant com munities across three spatial scales in the Sonoran Desert. At five xeric sites and five mesic sites spanning 645 km, we measured vegetation rich ness and abundance in plots undermeath 0. tesota canopies and in adjacent, unshaded control plots. Ordination of plant communities at the landscape scale (all sites combined) revealed no strong effect of 0. tesota on plant community composition. However, when we controlled for water stress, plant community structure was predictably different under 0. tesota in xeric sites, but not in mesic sites. At the smallest spatial scale (within sites), 0. tesota had strong facilitative effects on perennials in xeric sites, and smaller positive effects on ephemeral plants. In mesic sites, perennial richness was slightly higher under 0. tesota but abundances did not differ from control plots. Ephemerals were equally abundant and more diverse outside the shade of 0. tesota canopies, suggesting that 0. tesota may actually compete with existing vegetation where water is more abundant. Regardless of water stress, smaller 0. tesota canopies had an effect on plant communities dis proportionate to their size; larger canopies had lower overall densities of all plants than smaller canopies. Further, differences in plant communities under 0. tesota canopies and in control plots were not dependant on canopy size. In conclusion, facilitative effects of 0. tesota appear to be dependant on the scale at which these effects are viewed, as well as ambient stress levels. LOEHLE, C. National Council for Air and Stream Improvement of the Paper Industry, Naperville, IL 60540 USA. A solar-cycle model for hol ocene climates. Based on historical data, cycles of solar activity and climate were used to create a solar cycle model for Holocene climates. The model was fit to long-term temperature data. The model gives a good fit to temperature data of the past 150 years, including the cooling of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as to solar cycle data of the past 250 years. The model accurately predicts the major features of temperature for the past 3,000 years, based on a comparison with sediment data from the Sargasso Sea, and data from Europe based on glacial histories, tree ring records, and lake level fluctu ations. The model projects a continued warming of 0.1 deg. C by 2025, followed by a 200+ year cooling trend of about 1.0 deg. C. A fit against only recent (past 150 year) data yields a prediction that temperatures will rise by 0.91 deg. C by the year 2115. LOESCHER, H.' and S.

ENSO ef fects on bulk precipitation and temperature, and their potential con sequences for productivity in wet tropical ecosystems of Central Amer ica. ENSO events are purported to affect ecosystem productivity, but little is known about the magnitude at which climate can play a role. We examined differences between ENSO and non-ENSO events on regional patterns of bulk precipitation and temperature from three sites with contrasting sea sonal circulations in the lower Central American isthmus. Bulk precipita tion during the dry season at all three sites was negatively correlated to both the Southern Oscillation Index and the Sea-level Pressure Differential on a monthly timestep, while the wet season precipitation was positively correlated. There were marked qualitative seasonal differences in both mag nitude and frequency of bulk precipitation between ENSO and non-ENSO events as examined through Fast-Fournier Transforms (FFT) on a daily timestep. Mean minimum temperature regimes showed similar patterns with FF1 analyses. Model simulations show lower productivity during ENSO events in tropical wet forests. This suggests that during an ENSO, both higher minimum temperatures during dry season and greater rainfall in the wet are likely to have negative effects on productivity. LOHSE, K. A.,] H.

Interactions of soil hydrologic and biotic processes in regulating nitrate retention in wet tropical forests: Comparisons using isotope tracers. The consequences of anthropogenic nitrogen (N) additions for nitrate soil solution losses and the processes controlling them in wet tropical forests are poorly understood. Studies in many N-limited temperate forest ecosys tems suggest that forests experience a temporal delay between initiation of anthropogenic N inputs and nitrate losses. In the Hawaiian Islands, we found that wet tropical forests respond to first-time N additions with sub stantial nitrate losses, and that, surprisingly, N limited systems have higher losses than P-limited systems. Nitrate losses following first-time fertiliza tion accounted for 32-73% of the N added as fertilizer (50kg/ha) in the N limited site, whereas total nitrate losses only accounted for 8-17% in the P-limited site. We investigated the interaction of hydrologic flow processes and soil biotic processes in controlling nitrate loss in these N-limited and P- limited wet tropical forests by tracing the fate of isotopically enriched nitrate and water in a simulated rainfall experiment. In the N-limited site, 80% of the initial input concentration of nitrate was recovered at 30cm depth in the lysimeter after 41 hrs at a 0.25 cm/hr tracer rate application. Relatively small proportions of N were recovered in microbial biomass in both sites, although microbial uptake was greater in the N-limited site. A range of evidence suggests that diffusion of solute into areas of stagnant water or intra-aggregates and adsorption of solute onto the solid phase may be reducing nutrient loss in the older soils. Differences in soil hydrologic properties are apparently more important than biological properties in con trolling variation in nitrate solution losses in these tropical ecosystems.

Most studies of secondary succession focus on the recovery of plant com munities, but we know little about the recovery of animal communities and the interactions between plants and animals. Following a disturbance the rates of recovery will vary greatly among organisms and missing interac tions may slow or arrest succession. We assessed the recovery of interac tions by describing the seed bank, seed predation, seedling and sapling Oral Presentation Abstracts 147</page><page sequence="109">bank, soil cover, litter quantity, soil compaction, and landscape composition for 11 sites in a chronosequence in subtropical NW Argentina. These data were combined in a principal component analysis which separated the sites into two distinct groups (sites 10 yr). The young sites had high predation on small seeds, and low species richness in the seedling bank, with virtually no animal dispersed species implying a lack of resources to attract seed dispersers. In the older sites, seed predation increased with site age, par ticularly on large-seeded species, suggesting an increase in the diversity of the seed predator community. In addition to site age, proximity to mature forest influenced the recovery process. Sites within a forest matrix recov ered faster than sites that were more isolated. This simple and inexpensive approach for rapid assessment of secondary forests can be used to design and implement management plans and conservation strategies. LONG, Z. Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA. Pri ority effects determine the outcome of competition between species with similar competitive abilities. Various theories use differences between species resource consumption rates and resource requirements to predict outcomes of competition. Some evidence, however, demonstrates that outcomes of competition may not be deterministic, but depends on initial abundances of competing species. Ev idence for such priority effects comes mainly from experiments that are short in duration relative to the generation times of the organisms studied. It remains unclear if differences caused by initial conditions can persist over time or if competition always leads to convergence on a deterministic outcome. I tested if certain species always outcompete others regardless of initial conditions or if differences in initial conditions can persist despite competition using aquatic microcosm experiments. I grew four bacteri vores, Paramecium caudatum, Paramecium tetraurelia, Tetrahymena ther mophila, and Colpidium striatum, in monoculture and measured their abil ity to reduce levels of their resource, bacteria, to determine relative com petitive abilities. P. caudatum, P. tetraurelia, and C. striatum did not differ significantly in the level to which they reduced bacteria, but they all re duced bacteria to significantly lower levels than T. thermophila. I allowed each species to reach high abundance in monoculture, and then subjected each species to invasion by low numbers of the remaining other three bacterivores, and invasion by low numbers of the other three bacterivores and a generalist predator, Actinosphaerium. All species that were initially dominant maintained dominance after approximately six generations, ex cept T. thermophila which declined significantly in abundance when sub jected to invasion by the other three bacterivores. The initially high abun dance of T. thermophila did not prevent invasion by the better competitors. These results identify a clear priority effect: When species are similar in competitive ability initial conditions determine the outcome of competition. LONG, T. M. and R. L. SINSABAUGH. University of Toledo, Toledo, OH 43606, USA. Functional response of rhizosphere microbial communi ties at the Duke and Oak Ridge FACE experiments. As the primary interface linking producers and decomposers, changes in the structure and/or function of the rhizosphere are key in predicting the response of intact ecosystems to increased atmospheric CO2. In order to assess the impact of a rising CO2 fraction on rhizosphere function, we have been monitoring changes in the activities of extracellular enzyme systems that mediate transformations of detrital C, N, and P at two different FACE experimental sites: A loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation at Duke forest (3 years), and a sweetgum (Liquidamber styraciflua) plantation at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL, 1 year). At Duke, CO2 enrichment increases the activities of - and 3-glucosidase (G, iG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), 1 xylosidase (,3X), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), and leucine-aminopep tidase (LAP), indicating an increased demand for nitrogen and stimulation in the turuover of labile polysaccharides. This may be due to the effect of "C priming" increasing the availability of labile carbon due to fine root turuover. However, reduced activities of phenol oxidase (P0) and peroxi dase (Px) suggest that CO2 enrichment may inhibit the decomposition of more recalcitrant compounds such as lignin and humus. Taken together with substrate utilization profiles, the Duke data indicate a functional shift in the rhizosphere community toward more opportunistic bacterial activity in response to CO2 enrichment. At ORNL, enzyme activities were markedly different from those observed at Duke. Our first year's data at ORNL showed that CO2 enrichment increased the activities of PO and Px while reducing the activities of N-acquiring (NAG, LAP) and cellulolytic (G, 1G, PX, CBH) enzymes. These results suggest that the direction and magnitude of microbial response to CO2 enrichment will vary regionally and across forest types and may depend, in part, on initial nutrient status. The observed trends suggest that the Oak Ridge system may be less responsive to C priming, perhaps due to higher initial nutrient availability, and may respond over the long term by decreasing soil C storage. However, in nutrient lim ited, low C quality systems such as Duke forest, soil C storage may in crease. LONG, R. P,1 J. OMER2 and R.

Sug ar maple mortality on the Allegheny National Forest from 1990-1999 in relation to management and defoliation. Sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marsh. has been declining across the ungla ciated Allegheny Plateau in northwestern Pennsylvania since the mid 1980s. In 1990, the Allegheny National Forest (ANF), in cooperation with Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, installed a long-term sugar maple health monitoring network in 30 stands across the ANF, using pro tocols similar to those used by the North American Maple Project (NAMP). Ten of the stands had no cutting in the last 30-40 years, 12 stands were thinned within the last 10 years, and eight stands were located in recently harvested areas where only a few trees per acre, usually sugar maples, were left as residuals. In this latter group of stands, plots were not feasible; instead about 15-20 of the residual sugar maples were measured across the harvested area. In uncut and thinned stands, all standing trees = 10 cm dbh were tallied within three 20 m by 20 m plots and tree health status and defoliation incidence and severity were determined annually by two observers. Initial sugar maple mortality (number of dead sugar maple as a percent of all sugar maple in a three plot cluster) in 1990 averaged 2.3% (range 0 to 13.3%) for all 30 stands. Average sugar maple mortality from 1990-1999 in all crown classes was 3.2%/yr for uncut stands, 2.3%/yr for thinned stands, and 4.3%/yr for sugar maple residual stands. These mor tality rates exceed those reported by the NAMP for a similar period in which average mortality was 0.9%/yr (range 0.2 to 1.9%/yr) for 9 states and 4 provinces. Mortality rates in most stands were highest from 1991 to 1995, coincident with drought (1991) and with outbreaks of defoliating insects including elm spanworm, Ennomos subsignaria, forest tent cater pillar, Malacosoma disstria, and fall cankerworm, alsophila pometaria .

Acid deposition effects on soil biodiversity and decomposition processes in Ohio Valley broadleaved forests. Studies of acid loadings, soil responses and diversity in species-rich insect families have been carried out along a gradient in cumulative deposition from southern Illinois to southern Ohio. Results show a direct, nearly linear response in soil chemical measures at carefully matched soil, forest cover and substrate geology types. The response correlates strongly with the mag nitude of cumulative acidic inputs. The abundance and diversity of four insect groups is depressed in proportion to the decline in soil surface pH observed at the sites. The combined number of species in the Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae, and Formicidae declined from 37 to 16 as the acid loading increased and soil pH declined. Three mechanisms comprising risks to survival of insect populations are evident, including the effects of H+ concentrations on the ion balance of young insect larvae, the effect of occasional toxic A13+ flushing on soil insects during rain events, and the effect of nitrogen and ammonia enrichment throughout the soil decomposer food chain. Other data show that soil carbon processing and nutrient cy cling have been diminished in proportion to the loss of soil fauna, leading to impaired ecosystem function and nutrient deficiencies. 148 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="110">LOVETT, G.

Effect of tree species on nitrogen cycling in the Catskill Mountains, NY: Fertilization studies. Nitrate concentration in stream water varies 18-fold among small, forested watersheds in the Catskill Mountains, NY. Part of that variation appears to be attributable to differences in tree species composition in the watersheds. In particular, our sampling shows that watersheds with a significant per centage of oak in the forest typically have low (&lt; 10 micromolar) nitrate concentrations throughout the year. We established 30 pairs of single-spe cies plots to study N cycling associated with the five major tree species of the Catskills. One plot of each pair is fertilized with 50 kg N/ha/y, while the other plot is unfertilized. We find highly significant (p&lt;0.0001) differ ences among species in potential N mineralization and nitrification rates, with northern red oak having particularly low rates of potential nitrification. Preliminary results from fertilized plots indicate that N fertilization increas es nitrification rates (relative to control plots) in species with low-lignin foliage, such as sugar maple (control vs. fertilized p=0.017), but decreases nitrification rates in high-lignin species like red oak (p&lt;0.0001) and Amer ican beech (p&lt;0.0001). These results suggest that forest species compo sition may partially control N retention by forested watersheds, and that different forest types may respond in a qualitatively different manner to excess nitrogen loading from the atmosphere.

Effects of a nitrogen and competition gradient on the growth of an exotic invasive annual and a slow-growing native perennial. Exotic plant invasions are a serious concern for land managers and con servationists. Exotic plant invasions may be exacerbated by alterations in the global nitrogen cycle, so it is important to compare the effects of ni trogen availability on the growth and competitive abilities of both exotic and native plant species. This study was conducted to determine the effects of increasing and decreasing nitrogen availability on the growth and com petitive ability of two grass species with contrasting life histories, Bromus tectorum, an exotic, and Bouteloua gracilis, a native. We investigated the effects of nitrogen availability and competition on aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, height, and % nitrogen tissue concentrations by growing the two species in the greenhouse under five levels of nitrogen and five levels of competition. Both species had a significant response to increasing nitrogen availability, with Bromus having a much stronger re sponse than Bouteloua. The exotic weed species was able to exploit excess nitrogen enrichment, but the native species was not able to expand its growth past a certain level when the excess nitrogen was available. Com petition significantly affected both species. Bromus was negatively im pacted only by intraspecific competition, while Bouteloua was strongly negatively affected by interspecific competition from Bromus. Reducing available nitrogen suppressed the growth of both species, but did not give the native species a competitive advantage over the exotic species. Our results suggest that the success of efforts which attempt to suppress the spread of exotic weeds by reducing nitrogen availability may depend on the species of weed present. LUECKE, C., B. THOMPSON and N. MESNER. Utah State University, Logan, Utah 84322-5230 USA. Using nitrogen stable isotopes to assess linkages between land use activities and water quality in western US watersheds. Agricultural practices of applying fertilizer to crops and grazing livestock tend to enhance the proportion of N-15 to N-14 delivered to the streams and lakes of a watershed. We evaluated the degree of this enhancement by measuring the stable isotopes of nitrogen in primary producers and primary consumers along a stream course that flowed from high elevation wilder ness into and through an agricultural valley. The proportion of N-i5 in periphyton and the same species of mayfly increased in proportion to the degree of agricultural developement in the watershed. Similar comparisons of the proportion of N-i5 in phytoplankton and herbivorous crustaceans in a series of lakes indicated that increases in N- 15 were correlated with the percentage of the watershed used as agricultural land. These results indicate that measurements of N- 15 in aquatic organisms may provide an integrative measure of water quality degradation in watersheds and be of value as an assessment tool over broad spatial ranges. LUO, Y. University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA. Progressive nitrogen limitation of plant and ecosystem responses to elevated CO2: A reexamination. Ecosystem models that link nutrient cycling with plant production generally predict long-term downregulation in plant production caused by progressive nitrogen (N) constraints in elevated CO2. The concept is that increased carbon (C) influx under elevated CO2 will immobilize more N in plant biomass and soil organic matter, progressively leading to less N available for plant uptake. However, the predicted downregulation in production has not been confirmed by most of the field CO2 experiments. The discrepancy between model predictions and experimental data apparently results from a fundamental knowledge gap concerning ecosystem C and N interactions. This study examines N demand and supply mechanisms in the context of Duke Forest FACE site where the CO2 concentration has been increased from the ambient level to 560 ppm since 1996. In response to elevated CO2, both measurements and modeling indicated an approximately 40% increase in ecosystem C influx and a 300 g C m-2 yr' increase of net ecosystem productivity (NEP). The latter would require an additional 6 g N m-2 yr-' to balance C:N relationships in the ecosystem. A model is also used to explore various N supply mechanisms that might meet N demand in response to rising CO2. Those mechanisms include adjustment in the C: N ratio in live biomass, net mineralization, and rhizosphere expansion, N fixation by free living organisms and symbiotic species, N deposition, re duced losses through leaching and volatilization.

Survival and growth of seedlings of 12 Chilean temperate rainforest trees in contrasting light environments: gas exchange and allocational corre lates. The dominant paradigm of tree life histories attributes contrasting suites of traits to "pioneer" and "non-pioneer" species, emphasizing strong interre lationships between growth, regenerative and life history traits. However, there is still disagreement as to the physiological determinants of some of the trade-offs involved. Furthermore, there has been little work on southern temperate rainforests, where life history variation may be less straightfor ward than that proposed by the prevailing paradigm. We measured survival and growth of seedlings of 12 Chilean temperate rainforest trees in two light environments (150 y 15 p.moles m-2 s-'), in order to examine diversity of seedling behaviour in this forest type, and to identify the physiological/ morphological correlates of this variation. RGR and biomass allocation parameters were estimated by harvesting plants in both light treatments. RGR in high light was highly correlated (P &lt; 0.0001) with photosynthetic capacity. Mortality in low light was positively correlated with light com pensation point (P = 0.03) and with photosynthetic capacity (P = 0.02). Furthermore, high-light RGR was positively correlated with low-light mor tality (P = 0.01). Neither mortality nor growth in either treatment was significantly correlated with any biomass allocation trait. Although the seedlings of long-lived light-demanding species showed similar low-light mortality to short-lived "classic" pioneers, the latter grew much faster in high light. Gas exchange traits appear to be major determinants of inter specific variation in seedling performance. However, the limited range of variation in light compensation points suggests that traits other than those which we measured are also probably important in determining shade tol erance differences. The heterogeneity evident among the shade-intolerant species suggests that a single axis of trait variation is insufficient to de scribe tree life history variation in Chilean temperate rainforests.

However, climatic constraints prevented establishment at sites between 1500 and 1700 m in the Bighorn Basin and western Pryor Mountains until 2500-1500 yr BP due to a late Holocene wet episode (4500 to 2500 yr BP). J. osteosperma arrived at least 3600 yr BP in foothills southeast of the Wind River Moun tains. Unfortunately, a lack of older records cannot confirm that area as a stepping stone from Flaming Gorge to the Bighorn Basin. The quasi-syn chronous appearance of J. osteosperma at many sites in the Bighorn Basin indicates a climatic control in the expansion of J. osteosperma. In addition, Cercocarpus ledifolius, another Great Basin species, migrated into the Big horn Basin during the late Holocene, also suggesting a climatic role. The invasion of J. osteosperma to these sites consistently resulted in a decline or disappearance of J. scopulorum populations on south-facing slopes, and woodland densities appear to have increased concurrently. Although graz ing and fire suppression have played a role in the 20th century expansion of J. osteosperma onto native rangelands, this expansion is a continuation of the natural late Holocene invasion and consequent population infilling.

Soil respiration rate (SRR) among patches of a heterogeneous mixed-conifer forest in a Mediterranean climate. We investigated the relationship between soil respiration rate (SRR), sur face temperature (Tsf) and moisture (Ms) in a Mediterranean climate in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer. From June to August 1999, at the Teakettle Experimental Forest, we took weekly measurements of SRR using a dy namic soil respiration system, in six dominant patch types defined by clus ter analysis of vegetation and litter depth measurements. The patch types were (1) bare ground, (2) deep litter layer with high canopy cover, (3) manzanita, (4) ceanothus, (5) rock or shallow soil, and (6) high canopy cover with coarse wood debris (CWD) on the ground. Soil surface tem perature and soil moisture at 15 cm were simultaneously measured at the same sampling points. The measured SRR values ranged from 0.42 (bare ground) to 2.23 gCO2/m2/hour (ceanothus). Based on patch types, this study confirmed that both Tsf and Ms affected SRR, but in the hot, dry summer typical of Mediterranean climates, Ms may limit SRR. The correlation co efficients for Tsf and SRR and Ms in bare ground, deep litter layer with high canopy, and manzanita patches was 0.87, 0.66, and 0.43, respectively. For these three patch types, SRR and Ms can be directly assessed with a linear regression model. The relationship, however, between SRR, Ms and Tsf in ceanothus, rocky-shallow soils, and high canopy cover/CWD patches was not significant. Based on year-round microclimatic data in the area, surface soil temperature may be the strongest influence on soil respiration rates in the winter, while respiration rates during the summer months are limited by soil moisture availability.

Naturalized floras are largely the products of de liberate introductions: Assessment of temperate and subtropical floras. Vast numbers of plant immigrants have long arrived in the U.S., but very few immigrations result in naturalization; the hazards of environmental stochasticity for immigrants are clearly acute and chronic. Deliberately in troduced species and those non-indigenous species introduced as contam inants in imported crop seeds experience post-immigration cultivation that could greatly enhance their persistence in spite of such stochasticity. We assessed the proportion of naturalized taxa (species, subspecies, varieties) that had been deliberately introduced or introduced as seed contaminants in a group of U.S. regional and state floras that span much of the environ mental amplitude of the U.S. The number of taxa in these naturalized floras vary substantially: northeastern U.S. (approx. 600), Hawaii (approx. 800), Florida (approx. 1150). The naturalized floras of New York, northcentral Texas, and Rhode Island each have about 400 taxa. We considered a nat uralized species to have been introduced deliberately if there was an un ambiguous historic record of its use in its native range, the U.S., or both. Despite the vast differences among these floras in their physical environ ments and the length and character of plant immigration history, the pro portion of the naturalized flora that was likely introduced deliberately is consistently greater than 50%. In the eastern U.S. the largest fractions of these deliberately introduced species were introduced as seasoning or pu tative sources of medicine; in subtropical Hawaii and Florida, ornamentals are the largest single fraction of the naturalized flora. Among naturalized species that were apparently introduced deliberately are many threats both to conservation and agriculture, including Abutilon theophrasti, Berberis vulgaris, Cynoglossum officinale, Eleusine indica, and Senecio jacobaea. The remaining proportions consist of taxa that were historic seed contam inants (usually &lt; 10%) and taxa with unknown modes of entry (approx. 30%). The link between deliberate introduction and subsequent post-im migration cultivation leading to naturalization, although still largely cir cumstantial, provides an explanation that transcends the taxonomic diver sity of naturalized species and the environments in their new ranges.

Effects of soil or ganic matter quality and microclimate on soil nitrogen transformations in arctic treeline ecosystems. Climate warming is expected to impact soil nutrient cycling in arctic eco systems directly through effects on soil temperature, and indirectly though changes in vegetation composition. To compare the relative effects of these two factors on net N transformations, we reciprocally transplanted intact soil cores among nearby tundra, shrub, and forest ecosystems that span treeline on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We assessed the effects of soil organic matter (SOM) quality (where a core originated) and microclimate (where a core was incubated) on rates of net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, and the percent of mineralized N that was nitrified over a six week incubation. In situ rates of mineralization were highest in forest and shrubland, and lowest in tundra. Nitrification rates were an order of mag nitude lower in forest and tundra than in shrubland, where 80% of min eralized N was nitrified. In the transplant experiment, mineralization was highly sensitive to both SOM quality and microclimate, and there was no interaction between these factors. Soils originating in forest and shrubland mineralized two times more N than tundra soils wherever they were in cubated. In the shrubland microclimate, all cores mineralized two times more N than in the forest or tundra. Nitrification was affected only by SOM quality, and was five times higher in shrubland soil than in forest or tundra soils. The percent of mineralized N that was nitrified, however, was strongly affected by SOM and microclimate, and these effects were inter active. Tundra and shrubland SOM nitrified a higher percent of mineralized N than forest and the forest microclimate induced the highest percent ni trified for all soils but its own, which had the lowest percent nitrified over all. These results suggest that climate warming is likely to have the greatest effect on N mineralization from forest soils because these soils have the highest SOM quality, but a depressive microclimate. Low nitrification po tential and large plant stature make it likely that increased N availability will be immobilized in plant biomass. In contrast, high nitrification poten tial and small plant biomass in tundra and shrub systems may lead to increased N loss in a warming climate, due to increased leaching or den itrifiction.

Quantifying the mean and extreme distances traveled and the direction of dispersal by organisms is critical for estimating effective population size and for predicting potential for colonization events. We used an isotopic tracer, 15N, to study the dispersal of individual adult stoneflies, Leuctra ferruginea (Leuctridae), whose larvae live in streams. '5N was added con tinuously for four to six weeks to two streams within the Hubbard Brook 150 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="112">Experimental Forest, NH, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, and collections were made within 600 m upstream and downstream of the addition site and in adjacent watersheds. Comparison of the initial distribution of labeled stone flies caught emerging from the stream reaches enriched with '5N to that of stoneflies caught subsequently in flight showed that prior to feeding as adults, males and females flew less than -30 m from their site of emer gence. Females that had fed extensively and returned to the stream to ovi posit flew on average --109 m upstream, with the maximum dispersal dis tance being 330 m upstream. These data also suggest that colonization by adults of nearby streams in other watersheds may be possible, as we found adults to fly as far as 250 m laterally from the stream into the hardwood forest. The colonization cycle hypothesis proposes that upstream flight of adult stream insects may be necessary to maintain population densities if larvae drift downstream. Leuctra ferruginea is most abundant throughout the Northeast in small, acidic headwater streams, but drifts infrequently (0.02 individuals/1000L discharge, or 0.04 individuals/hr). Potential selec tion pressures for upstream flight in species that do not drift in high den sities may include greater competitor and/or predator densities, or unfa vorable abiotic conditions in downstream habitats.

In the third treatment year (1999), increases in light saturated photosynthetic rates with atmo spheric [C02] were linear and greatest in Bromus japonicus (C3 grass), followed by Solanum dimidiatum, (C3 forb) and Bothriocloa ischamaum (C4 grass). Net photosynthesis (A) versus intercellular CO2 (A-Ci) response curves revealed that only Bothriocloa and Solanum up-regulated carbox ylation efficiency at sub-ambient [C02]. There was no evidence of photo synthetic down-regulation at elevated [CO2] in any species. Decreases in light saturated stomatal conductance (g) with treatment [C02] were greatest in Solanum, followed by Bromus and Bothriocloa. The largest decline in g in all species occurred from sub-ambient to ambient [C02]. Preliminary analysis of g-Ci curves, however, revealed no evidence of stomatal accli mation to treatment [C02]. These results provide partial evidence of the responsiveness of photosynthetic biochemistry to sub-ambient [CO2]. They suggest that the stimulation of carbon fixation by elevated CO2 in the dom inant species of a grassland are not constrained by potential adaptations to sub-ambient [CO,]. MAIER, C. A.,' T. J.

Stand respiration and carbon balance in mid-rotation lob lolly pine plantations in response to enhanced soil resource availability. Pine forests in the southeastern United States are some of the most inten sively managed forests in the world and may be an important resource for sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). However, while intensive manage ment (e.g. fertilization) increases productivity, the effect on stand C balance and loss via respiration is still unclear. In this study, we developed C bud gets for 11 year-old loblolly pine plantations during the fourth year of a fertilization experiment to determine how autotrothic respiration (RA), soil CO2 evolution, and net ecosystem production (NEP) respond to changes in soil resource availability. C budgets were based on component analysis, i.e. biomass production and specific respiration (maintenance and growth) of individual tissues (foliage, branch, stem, fine and coarse roots) and soil CO2 evolution. In the non-fertilized treatments, total net primary production (NPP) was 5.6 Mg C ha-' yr-' compared to 10.4 Mg C ha-' yr- in fertilized treatments. Total RA was 10.1 and 16.5 Mg C ha-' yr'l in non-fertilized and fertilized treatments, respectively. Belowground root respiration accounted for 63% of total RA in non-fertilized stands, but only 53% of RA in fertilized stands. Fertilization had no effect on soil CO2 evolution. Annual C loss from the soil averaged 14 Mg C ha-' yr- and contributed 79% (unfertilized) and 65% (fertilized) of ecosystem respiration (soil CO2 evolution + above ground RA). NEP, calculated as the difference between NPP and soil CO2 evolution minus belowground RA (NEP=NPP- (soil CO2 evolution-below ground RA)) was -1.8 Mg C ha-' yr' in non-fertilized stands and 4.7 Mg C ha-' yr-' in fertilized stands indicating that non-fertilized stands were functioning as slight C sources to the atmosphere while fertilized stands were strong C sinks. These results suggest that manipulating site resources may be an attractive management tool to increase the rate of C sequestra tion in forest ecosystems. MAINAGITOGO, G. and W. M. JACKSON. University of Illinois at Chi cago, Chicago Illinois 60607 USA. Response of avian assemblages to fragmentation in a tropical rain forest in Kenya. Vegetation structure is well known to influence bird community organiza tion. We assessed differences in forest bird assemblages and vegetation structure in six forest fragments in a tropical rain forest in Kenya. Two fragments were heavily disturbed, two were relatively undisturbed and two were of intermediate disturbance. We measured vegetation variables at sev en distances from forest edge to interior. In all fragments, canopy vegetation cover, trees species richness, density and diameter increased along an edge interior gradient, while vegetation structure (at 0-1 m height) decreased. Undisturbed fragments had a more complex vegetation structure than heavi ly disturbed fragments. We used mist-net and point-count surveys along the edge-interior gradient to sample bird assemblages, capturing 545 birds during 2100 net hours and detecting 626 individuals during point counts. Overall, we recorded a total of 53 bird species. Bird species richness and abundance was higher at the edge, although differences among forests were not entirely consistent for mist-net and point-count data. At the guild level, frugivores, arboreal granivores, and insectivores were more abundant at the edge than in the interior. At the species level, birds in the disturbed frag ments were restricted to the forest interior whereas in the undisturbed frag ments they were more widely distributed. Our results indicate that edge and interior bird assemblages are different. The difference in the distribu tion of birds among these habitats appeared to reflect constraints on habitat use imposed by vegetation structure, and could relate to differential distri bution of food resources, especially fruits and insects. MALONEY, P. E. and D. M. RIZZO. University of California, Davis, CA 95616. Incidence and spread of white pine blister rust: Implications for disease dynamics. White pine blister rust (WPBR), caused by Cronartium ribicola, is an ex otic pathogen that infects and kills 5-needle pine species in the western United States. In addition to pine, C. ribicola must also infect Ribes spp. to complete its life-cycle. Tree species in the Sierra Nevada that are affected by this disease include sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), western white pine (Pinus monticola) and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis). Sugar pine grows in mixed-conifer forests in the lower montane zone, western white pine grows in upper montane and subalpine zones, and whitebark pine exists only in the subalpine zone. To understand patterns of pathogen spread and the effect this disease may have on host population dynamics we surveyed 5-needle pine species in 30-40 ha grids in mixed-conifer forests in the central Sierra Nevada and in a subalpine location in the Lake Tahoe Basin, in the northern Sierra Nevada. In addition, we ran transects in 17 different upper montane/subalpine locations around Lake Tahoe. In mixed-conifer forests, WPBR incidence is largely dependent on topographic features, that favor environmental conditons suitable for rust infection, as well as the presence of Ribes. In the more environmentally homogenous subalpine lo cation, WPBR incidence was less variable and more uniformly spread. However, across the Lake Tahoe Basin WPBR incidence is quite variable. Much of the variablity associated with incidence across the Lake Tahoe Basin is due to differences in environmental conditions, and possibly ge netic heterogeneity and isolation of hosts. Where environmental conditions are favorable for WPBR, we have observed increased mortality among smaller pine recruits. Oral Presentation Abstracts 151</page><page sequence="113">MANSON, R. H.

The role of spatial autocorrelation in the detection and interpretation of patterns of tree seed and seedling predation by rodents in old-fields. Spatial autocorrelation is present in all ecological systems. However, con sideration of this phenomena in seed and seedling depredation studies has been limited, perhaps explaining some of the variation observed between studies and the difficulty in generalizing about the impacts of herbivores on successionary processes. I examined the patterns and prevalence of spa tial autocorrelation in the survival of neighboring tree seeds and seedlings experimentally placed into old-fields located in New York state, U.S.A. All experiments were conducted within enclosures in which it was possible to manipulate the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) while simultaneously allowing entry by competitively inferior white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). White-footed mice and meadow voles are the dom inant consumers of tree seeds and seedlings in old-fields of the northeastern United States, respectively. Spatial autocorrelation was present in approx imately 50% of all predation trials conducted. Furthermore, the frequency of spatial autocorrelation increased under low vole density conditions and in study sites with greater heterogeneity in vegetation cover. Survival of neighboring tree propagules was generally positively autocorrelated, sug gesting that mouse and vole foraging should generate clumped patterns of tree propagule survival. A review of 24 published predation studies found that only 13% attempted to test or control for spatial autocorrelation and that the minimum average spacing used between replicates was well below the average autocorrelation distance of 8.1 m observed in the current study. Patterns of autocorrelation appear predictable based on knowledge of the ecology of mice and voles and to provide insights into the factors influ encing their foraging decisions and potential impacts on old-field succes sion.

Timing and mechanism of impact of the Swiss needle cast fungus, Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii, on Douglas-fir needle gas exchange and rubisco activation. Gas exchange of two-year-old Douglas-fir seedlings, artificially inoculated with the Swiss needle cast (SNC) fungus, Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii, was monitored on a monthly basis using A/Ci curve analysis. Gas exchange (CO, and H20) showed a significant reduction during the winter months; however, no impact of fungal presence on gas exchange was noted until the emergence of pseudothecia from needle stomata. Once present, maxi mum stomatal conductance was inversely proportional to pseudothecia presence. Impacts of SNC on CO2 assimilation rates were also observed at the onset of pseudothecia development, and when ca. 19% of the stomata were occluded with pseudothecia, net CO2 assimilation declined by ca. 50%. A/Ci curve analysis showed that declines in CO2 assimilation were due to both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Stomatal limitations were the direct result of reduced CO2 diffusion through blocked stomata. Non-stomatal limitations arose, in part, from pseudothecia development and the associated decline in stomatal conductance reducing rubisco activation. For example, in both SNC infected foliage and foliage with artificially blocked stomata (i.e., external application of petroleum jelly), the amount of rubisco activation showed a strong, positive relationship with maximum stomatal conductance. However, the total amount of fungal-derived non stomatal limitations to CO2 assimilation could not be attributed to this effect only. MANUEL MORALES, J. 1,2 'University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; 2LIEY Scaling-up movements in heterogeneous landscapes: Im portance of behavior. Movement of organisms within and across landscapes is a key process. Correlated random walks models (CRW) have been successful in modeling movement at the scale at which the data were collected. To examine wheth er extrapolation to bigger scales in heterogeneous landscapes is possible, I videotaped Tribolium confusum beetles moving in 'fast' and 'slow' exper imental patches of 25 by 25 cm (small scale). These patches were con structed with paper and masking tape, and differed only by their physical structure. Observed turning angle and step length distributions were used in a spatially explicit, individual based model. The spatial position of an individual was represented by continuous x and y coordinates which were projected onto a landscape map. At every iteration of the model, individuals chose a step length and a turning angle according to the patch type in which they were located. Edge effects where incorporated as fixed proba bilities of crossing a boundary between different patch types. Model iter ations reflected observed time scale of beetle movement behavior. I com pared simulated mean squared displacement over time to that observed for real beetles in an independent set of mosaic micro-landscape experiments of 4 by 4 meters (large scale). Only the most general prediction of slower spread in landscapes with slow patches and with edge effects held for the landscape experiments. Correlated random walk models parameterized at single patch scale under-predicted larger scale spread. These failures oc curred because moving organisms violated the assumption of constant movement behavior. However, random walk simulations were flexible enough to accommodate changes in turning angle distributions with time and produce good fits to observed data. Beetle turning angle distributions depended not only on the patch type they occupied but also on how much time they spent in the experimental landscape. These experimental results illustrate the difficulties of extrapolating movement observations across temporal and spatial scales. Within the same type of patches, and depending on their physiological state and/or time since the beginning of dispersal, organisms could alternate between a thorough exploration (with high var iance in turning angles) and escape from an area that is not suitable for them.

Previous work has clearly demonstrated significant changes in fish behavior when individuals are raised in a hatchery environment versus rearing in a natural setting. The present study examined brain morphology of hatchery and wild-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) for differences in brain size. We examined two populations of wild fish and two hatchery strains. Using multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with standard length, sexual maturity and age, we found wild-reared fish have significantly larger brains per body size overall, and were specifically larger in the following regions: optic tectum, telencephalon, olfactory bulb and olfactory nerve. These results suggest the importance of early rearing environment on the natural development of fish brains. The hatchery fish we examined have reduced neurobiological structures but it may be possible to alter the hatchery rearing environment to more closely mirror a natural environment and thus lessen the negative impact hatchery fish have on dwindling wild stocks. This work has pro found implications for the management, stocking and restoration of declin ing fish populations worldwide. The work also suggests the possibility of an index of salmonid brain morphology that would provide concrete com parisons of hatchery and wild fish brains and essentially provide an asess ment tool for evaluation of improved hatchery procedures.

Predation risk and food quantity in the selection of habitat by black tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus): An optimal foraging approach. Foraging theory predicts there is a balance between the cost and benefit that each individual takes in selecting a food patch. Two main factors taken in account should be: (1) the quantity (benefit) of the food obtained, and (2) the risk (cost) of being killed while eating. In the Chihuahuan Desert (Mapimi Biosphere Reserve) we previously determined that densities of black tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) are higher in tobosa grasslands (Hilaria mutica) than mesquite-creosotebush-prickly pear shrublands (Pro sopis glandulosa-Larrea tridentata-Opuntia rastrera) (25.2 mnd/km2 vs 16.8 mnd/kin2, P = 0.043, t=2.14, d.f. = 22). Additionally we observed zones of high and low use inside each habitat area. We tested the prediction that jackrabbits incorporate food quantity and predation risk in their selection of foraging habitat. To test this prediction, we established an experimental design with two blocks (shrubland and grassland), two factors (high and low densities) and seven repetitions (bimonthly samples).We measured 152 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="114">three variables at 20 points along eight, 200 m transects: (1) The number of scats collected in 10 m2 plots for an estimate of use by jackrabbits, (2) Vegetation structure (density, coverage, and height) at each point for an estimate of predation risk and (3) Number of shrubs, grasses, and forbs found in line transects at each point for an estimate of food quantity. We found jackrabbits used grasslands more than shrublands (P= 0.03). How ever forage production in shrublands was significantly higher than grass lands. Within each habitat type, we found no difference in structure be tween high and low use areas but did find significantly higher forage pro duction in high use areas. We interpreted these results as supporting the predictions of optimal foraging theory. Given equal predation risk levels within a given habitat jackrabbits were selecting areas based only on level of food resources. However, when faced with different risk levels, jackrab bits showed a preference for lower quality grasslands where they could more easily detect and thus escape predation than in the dense shrublands. In conclusion, optimal foraging theory seems to adequately explain habitat use patterns of jackrabbits in the desert environment. MARKS, J.,] B. HUNGATEI and D.

Applications of stable isotopes for understanding anthropogenic effects of aquatic food webs in Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico. Cuatro Cienegas, a protected area in northern Mexico has over 200 fresh water habitats that host an unusual number of endemic fish and snails. The two major threats to the native species are water extraction and invading species. We used stable isotopes o to compare food web structure in pristine versus disturbed habitats with particular focus on Cichlasoma minckleyi, an endemic cichlid, which is widespread in the basin and has a trophic polymorphisim. The two common morphs, (detritivore and molluscivore), differ in pharyngeal tooth morphology. Diet studies suggest strong overlap between the morphs. We used stable isotopes to test whether the morphs have different diets. Stable isotopes offer two advantages over diet studies by allowing for large non-destructive samples and providing a temporally integrated assessment of diet. We collected fish from eight habitats and determined their morphology using an otoscope and took a small fin clip ping for isotope analysis. Morphs differed in d'3C, indicating that they have different food sources, but did not differ in d'5N, suggesting that they oc cupy similar trophic positions. Hemichromis sp. an invading cichlid had similar d'5N values as C. minckleyi but differed in d'3C. Differences in isotope values among sites did not correlate with the Hemichromis inva sion. Analysis of museum specimens of an endemic pupfish show reduc tions in d'5N in disturbed but not pristine habitats. MARSH, A. S.,' J. P. MEGONIGAL2 and B. G. DRAKE.'

The objective of our study was to identify the fate of 5.6 kg C m-2 of excess' carbon assimilated over a 12-year period (1988-1999) by a C3 salt marsh exposed to elevated CO2. We focused on three potential carbon sinks in a community dominated by the C3 plant Scirpis olneyi: Winter ecosystem respiration, hydrologic export, and the soil carbon pool. Poten tial carbon sinks were also analyzed in an adjacent C4 community domi nated by Spartina patens. Winter whole-system respiration rates were not effected by the CO2 treatment in either community. Hydrologic export may account for as much as 23% of the 'excess' carbon in the Scirpus com munity as plots exposed to elevated CO2 showed a consistent increase in dissolved inorganic carbon of 6 to 27% compared to ambient levels. There was no increase in dissolved inorganic carbon in the interstitial waters of the Spartina community with elevated C02, or of dissolved organic carbon in the interstitial waters of either community. We are currently analyzing soil samples to determine the size and recalcitrance of the soil carbon pool. MARTENS, S. N. University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA. Landscape patterns of overland flow in a semi-arid biome tran sition zone. I investigated the patterns and importance of overland flow in semi-arid landscapes, using the ecohydrological model SPLASH (Simulator for Pro cesses of Landscapes: Surface/Subsurface Hydrology) and the extensive data sets of the Sevilleta LTER. The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge covers about 100,000 ha in central New Mexico and encompasses the tran sition zone of four biomes: Chihuahuan Desert, Great Plains grassland, Great Basin shrubland, and Rocky Mountain conifer. SPLASH simulates precipitation interception, snowmelt by energy balance calculations, Pen man-Monteith evaporation of intercepted water, free water, soil water and transpiration, vadose zone infiltration using the Green-Ampt equation, groundwater recharge, lateral Darcian groundwater flow, and lateral over land flow using Manning's equation and the zero inertia assumption. SPLASH includes simulation of soil evaporation appropriate for arid lands. Meteorological variables measured at seven stations were spatially distrib uted over the landscape using inverse distance weighting and elevation lapse functions. Vegetation was parameterized using Landsat TM and ex tensive field measurements. Terrain was described by USGS digital ele vation model at 30 m horizontal resolution. Most soil physical parameters were derived from the NRCS soil survey. However, surface roughness (Manning's n) was difficult to parameterize from existing data. I used an inverse, iterative technique to determine Manning's n for a small watershed (76 ha) runoff event by matching SPLASH simulations to the measured exit hydrograph. Subsequent applications of this spatially-averaged Man ning's n parameterization to other events and watersheds gave mixed re sults. Because of non-linear interactions among watershed elements, im proved results might be achieved by methods that can yield higher spatial resolution parameterizations. MARTIN, J., J. THIBAULT2 and V.

Current consequenc es of an ancient introduction: Rats, island characteristics and colonial nesting birds in the Mediterranean. The devastation of island faunas by alien species has been instrumental in raising concerns about the global threat to biological diversity. Colonial nesting species, often restricted to islands, have been severely impacted. Eradication of introduced species, used as a means to alleviate the problem, is usually done with little or no understanding of the mechanisms governing interactions between introduced and native species. We analyze how island area, rock substrate, bird species biology and presence of an introduced species, the Black rat Rattus rattus, interact to explain the distribution and abundance of colonial nesting birds on a set of 72 islands from six archi pelagos in the Western Mediterranean. Rats were introduced to this region over 2000 years ago and these communities have had time to reach an equilibrium. Rats have more affected species distributions on the smaller islands, and on islands with an acidic or neutral rock substrate (coarse texture), than those with limestone, and smooth texture. The smallest spe cies are most sensitive to rats, are often absent from islands with rats, and are systematically absent on islands with rats and a coarse structured rock substrate. On the smaller islands, where rat densities are highest, larger colonial birds are negatively affected. On larger islands, where rat densities are lower and fluctuating from year to year, larger colonial birds can main tain healthy populations despite the presence of rats. Although rats caused local extinction or reduction in bird abundance, the presence of islands varying in size and/or substrate allowed most archipelagos to retain their suite of colonial nesting bird species, despite a presumably reduced abun dance for most species.

Population genetic parameters vary latitudinally within species: Implications for variation in speciation and extinction rates. Species richness declines with increased latitude in most taxa on a variety of spatial scales. This gradient in species richness may result from latitu dinal variation in speciation and extinction rates, which influence and are influenced by population genetic parameters. Specifically, if speciation rates are currently higher in the tropics, then genetic isolation by distance of populations should be greater among lower latitude populations. Converse ly, if recent extinctions and near-extinctions were greater at higher latitudes, population bottlenecks should have reduced variation within high latitude populations. We tested these predictions using within-species patterns of genetic variation in mtDNA from diverse vertebrate taxa whose distribu tions span a broad range of latitudes.

Implications for reintroduction of an endangered lime stone endemic: Lessons from field and greenhouse germination tests. Endangered species with restricted and threatened habitats may only persist if they can expand their ranges. The existing distribution of the endangered Arizona cliffrose (Purshia subintegra) in the Sonoran desertscrub suggest ed that habitat specificity was great; most individuals grow on Verde For mation Pliocene limestone mesas and associated first order drainages. Dis tinct plant community and soil changes from the tops of the mesas to the valleys suggested that soil qualities might be one factor responsible for this pattern. In 1998, we conducted greenhouse and field germination tests in 3 distinct habitats. Both studies indicated that Arizona cliffrose seeds can germinate and survive off of the mesa tops and do not require limestone mesa-top soils to germinate. However, in the field, germination was sig nificantly more successful and mortality was significantly lower on the limestone mesas than in the 2 other habitats tested. Soil moisture had the most significant influence on the pattern of seedling survival we observed in the field. Thus, to effectively increase the population of Purshia subin tegra we predict that successful reintroduction can only occur in areas where soil moisture is maintained above 10% for 10 months of the year until plants are well-established.

A 13C tracer technique for assessing fine root longevity in a North Carolina pine forest. Quantifying root lifespan and root turnover are two of the most intractable problems in studies of belowground processes in terrestrial ecosystems. The lack of information on the root mean residence time creates uncertainty in estimates of fine root production that affects estimates of forest net primary production. We have developed a method to assess root turnover using changes in the 613C signature of roots exposed to a depleted 13C air in a forest FACE experiment. The progressive change in 613C of the vegetation C allows a quantitative estimate of parameters such as the turnover time and biomass of roots. The experimental site is a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation located in the Duke Forest in North Carolina. The experimental plots receive a continuous supplement of CO2 to maintain an atmospheric concentration 200 ,LL L-1 above ambient. The CO2 used in the elevated plots is depleted in 13C 813C = -44[&amp;permil:] vs. PDB). Using this CO2 to elevate the atmospheric concentration changes the 813C of CO2 in the FACE plots from -8 [&amp;permil:] to -21 [&amp;permil:]. We found that roots growing in in-growth cores, after one year of fumigation, had the same 8 13C sig nature as leaves, indicating that root growth was derived from newly fixed C. The isotopic ratio, 813C of roots of the pines in the elevated CO2 treat ment is -39.5[&amp;permil:] compared to -28[&amp;permil:] in the ambient treat ment. The replacement of the fine root population with new fine roots grown since the beginning of fumigation of the experimental plots is grad ual and can be fitted to an exponential regression. This regression estimates that the lifespan of fine roots, (= 1 mm diameter), is 4.3 years, the lifespan of roots between 1 and 2 mm in diameter is 7.2 years and the lifespan of thicker roots, those larger than 2 mm but less than 5 mm, is 7.6 years. This technique can be applied to estimate root turnover in various existing FACE experiments and in other Global Change experiments using elevated CO2 with a constant 613C to fumigate vegetation.

Response of foliar N and P to excessive N deposition in a mid-Appalachian hardwood forest. There are increasing concerns about long-term effects of excessive nitrogen (N) deposition on terrestrial ecosystems. While considerable attention has been given to soil responses, there has been relatively little study of the possible responses of plants to N saturation. We studied autumnal N and phosphorus (P) dynamics in foliage of trees on two watersheds supporting stands of similar age at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia: WS3 (fertilized with ammonium sulfate annually since 1989) and WS7 (untreated control). WS3 has previously demonstrated significant ev idence of N-saturation. Presenescent and senesced leaves were collected from tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and red maple (Acer rubrum) on each watershed, and analyzed for N and P content. Mean N:P ratios were higher on WS7 for all species, although significantly so only for tulip poplar. Mean foliar N concentration was higher on WS7 for black cherry and red maple, but did not differ for tulip poplar. This contrasts with a 1993 study at FEF in which N concentration in leaves from WS3 was 10% higher for all three species. The change suggests that luxury uptake in the presence of higher available soil N is a transient phenomenon. Nutrient resorption efficiencies during senescence were relatively high for all species on both watersheds-66 to 81% for N and 70 to 82% for P. Mean P resorption did not differ significantly between watersheds. Mean efficiency of N resorption was consistently lower on WS3, although the difference was significant only for black cherry. This may reflect plasticity of resorption in response to reduced N limitation, or altered physiological function resulting from disruption of soil nutrient bal ances. MAYER, P., E. JORGENSEN and A.

Effects of exogenous N addition, mammalian exclusion, and detritivore diversity on decomposition in old fields. Plant litter decomposition strongly controls C and N flux in terrestrial eco systems. Anthropogenic inputs of N may influence decomposition by changing N supply to microbes or by changing litter quality and quantity. Detritivore diversity also may influence decomposition rates when diverse functional groups process litter more efficiently, whereas, mammalian con sumers may, in turn, affect detritivore diversity. This study was designed to test the effects on litter decomposition of 1) exogenous N inputs, 2) detritivore diversity, and 3) mammal diversity. N and mammals were ma nipulated in 16 plots in a factorial experiment where 4 plots each were treated with fertilizer only (48 kg/ha/yr), mammal exclusion only, a com bination of fertilizer and exclusion, or no treatment. A mixture of grass and forb litter of known quantity was contained in either fine (0.33 mm2) nylon mesh intended to exclude macro-detritivores (e.g. macroarthropods, isopods, annelid worms) or in coarse (6.35 mm2) mesh bags intended to allow access by all detritivores. Litter bags were placed ranidomly in each plot and collected every two months for one year. Loss of litter mass, C, and N were quantified as response variables. Neither the mammal exclusion nor N addition had significant main effects (ANOVA) on litter mass loss. However, a significant interaction between exclusion and N addition was observed (P = 0.02). Detritivore exclusion had the greatest influence on litter mass loss (P &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that N addition and mammal exclusion have complex interactive effects on litter decomposition presumably by exercising an influence on the detritivores. The results also indicate that macro-detritivores have a large effect on litter decomposition likely by shredding and processing recalcitrant fragments of litter, a result that has implications for the maintenance of detritivore diversity. Environ mental stressors, such as pesticides that remove larger detritivores from the decomposer community may affect nutrient flux patterns in terrestrial eco systems. MCARTHUR, 1 and R.

Bacterial information length as a predictor of stream health. The use of indicator organisms (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) as evi dence of stream health has been a common practice. The presence of certain bacteria, e.g., F. coli, is an immediate red flag. However, native bacteria control either directly or indirectly the rates of most ecosystem level pro cesses and little is known concerning their distribution spatially or tem porally. More specifically, the distribution of various bacterial genes should be indicative of various functions and these distributions may be different than those of specific bacteria because bacterial genes can be shared among 154 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="116">diverse taxa. We demonstrate using the concept of information length that the distribution of bacteria and/or their genes does relate to aspects of stream health. Because bacteria are the most intimate organisms with the environment these patterns may be the most sensitive indicators of stream condition. We have measured the information length of antibiotic resistance and soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) in both pristine and dis turbed coastal plain streams. sMMO genes code for the breakdown of meth ane and also the fortuitous breakdown of trichloroethylene (TCE). We dem onstrate that the pattern of antibiotic resistance is tightly linked to heavy metal contamination and meets specific predictions of the information length hypothesis. These data suggest that the distribution of antibiotic resistance is a good indicator of stream health and the actual geographic distance downstream affected by metal pollution. The distribution of sMMO is directly related to the production of methane. In our disturbed streams less organic matter accumulates and thus fewer sMMO genes can be found. These data indicate the power of the information length concept and suggest that various predictions arising from the concept can be used to address stream condition, stream function and processes.

Respiration and growth characteristics in subpopulations of Great Basin cheatgrass have adapted to local micro climates. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) is a dominant weed that has increased the frequency of wildfire in the Great Basin since its introduction approx imately 115 years ago. Characteristics of respiratory metabolism were ex amined in eleven subpopulations from different habitats. Seeds from each subpopulation were germinated (4mm radicle) and metabolic heat rates (q) and respiration rates (RCO2) determined calorimetrically at 5?C intervals from 5-30?C or from 5-45?C. From the experimental data, growth rates and ratios of q/Rc02 (as a measure of efficiency) were calculated. Growth rate increased from a lower temperature limit of 3-7?C to an upper tem perature limit of 27-3 1?C. Beyond these limits growth ceased. These limits differ among subpopulations, and were related to the native microclimate. The natural history of cheatgrass agrees with the laboratory data-cheatgrass is an annual that germinates in the fall, overwinters as seedlings, and grows very rapidly in the early spring.

Anthropogenic disturbances and changes in land management have enabled many woody species to expand into grasslands. In C4 dominated tallgrass prairies, invasion of C3 shrubs have increased with the suppression of fire. Research on the mechanisms responsible for this expansion of woody spe cies and its consequences relies on the assumptions that the C3 shrubs are functionally equivalent and distinct from C4 grasses. Specifically, C4 grasses are thought to have greater water use efficiency and higher photosynthetic rates than the C3 shrubs during the hot dry summers. In addition, grasses are thought to better compete for soil water in shallow soil layers and can take advantage of smaller precipitation amounts, while shrubs, rely more on deeper soil water and are less susceptible to short-term droughts. To evaluate these assumptions in tallgrass prairies, three C3 shrub species, Cornus drummondii, Prunus americana, and Rhus glabra, and the domi nant C4 grass, Andropogon gerardii, were selected for intensive study on Konza Prairie. Andropogon gerardii had higher photosynthetic potential (17.8 p. mol m -2s-) than either C. drummondii or P. americana, but not R. glabra (11.1, 12.9, and 17.8 p. mol m -2s-1, respectively). Rhus glabra had greater water use efficiency than either C. drummondii or P. americana, however, all were lower than A. gerardii (1.36, 0.95, 0.93, and 1.99 ,jmol CO2 / p.mol H20, respectively). Photosynthetic rates for A. gerardii and P. americana had greater ties to shallow soil moisture than C. drummondii or R. glabra. Our results indicate that these three shrubs could not be consid ered functional equivalents, nor were they, as a group, distinct from A. gerardii. MCCLURE, M. and B. SANDERSON.

Since 1991, twelve salmonid Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) in the Columbia River Basin have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Human impacts on these stocks include in river and ocean harvest, freshwater rearing and spawning habitat degra dation and loss, estuarine habitat degradation, potential ecological and ge netic interactions with hatchery fish, and the construction of dams through out the basin. We conducted extinction risk analyses for the twelve listed ESUs, using a modified Dennis extinction analysis and a simple simulation model. In addition, we assessed the potential contribution of impacts in the "4 Hs" (habitat, harvest, hatcheries and hydropower) to current risk. Finally, we used age-structured matrix models (when possible) to identify life stag es at which reductions in mortality might contribute substantially to im proving population trajectories. All ESUs face substantial long-term risk; for example, the probability of extinction of Snake River stocks in the next 100 years ranges from 33-93%. Many stocks face substantial risk of ex tinction in the short-term as well (0-15%). Opportunities for improvements in survival vary from ESU to ESU. Some stocks may benefit significantly from actions in all areas, such as those that improve habitat, reduce harvest, and improve first year survival. MCCORMICK, M. K., K. L. O'MALLEY, D.

The distribution of orchids may depend on the distribution and diversity of appropriate symbionts. Orchids depend on mycorrhizal fungi early in life and continue these fungal associations as adults. We examined sym biotic associations between fungi and four orchid species with distributions ranging from widespread to narrow. We hypothesized that narrowly dis tributed orchids (Corallorhiza odontorhiza and Liparis lilifolia) would as sociate with fewer fungi than widespread species (Goodyera pubescens and Tipularia discolor). Fungi isolated from adult plants and protocorms of each species were used in lab experiments with seedlings of L. lilfolia and G. pubescens to determine whether fungi affected orchid growth differently as a function of growth medium, and hence might affect distributions. We also examined whether multiple fungi were beneficial to seedling growth. We found that C. odontorhiza and L. lilifolia each associated with one fungal type, while G. pubescens and T. discolor associated with multiple fungi. In the lab, only seedlings of G. pubescens obtained differential ben efits from fungi as a function of growth medium. Its seedlings also grew as well with two fungi as with one. Seedlings of L. lilifolia showed no differential effect of medium on fungal benefit and grew less well with two fungi than with one fungus. These preliminary results suggest that the ecological distribution of these four orchids may be a function of the di versity of mycorrhizal fungi they are able to utilize. MCDOWELL, N. G.,] N.

Evidence of hy draulic limitation and compensation in large, old Douglas-fir trees. As trees grow older and larger, increased hydraulic resistance due to path length could reduce stomatal conductance (g) and net photosynthesis (A). However, reduced leaf area:sapwood area ratios and/or increased capaci tance could partially or wholly compensate for this increased resistance. To investigate these possibilities, we measured gas-exchange and hydraulic properties in 20y, 40y, and 450y stands of Douglas-fir trees in Wind River, Washington during 1998 and 1999. Hydraulic limitation was assessed through measurement of A, gs, leaf water potential, and foliar cellulose dC'3. Hydraulic compensation was assessed via whole-tree estimates of leaf area:sapwood area ratios and sapflow estimates of capacitance. Evidence of a hydraulic limitation was observed in 450y trees. Mid-day leaf water potential averaged 0.6 MPa more negative for the 450y compared to the 20y and 40y. gsand A were consistently higher in the 20y than the 40y or 450y. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductance was significantly lower in 450y than the 40y or 20y trees. Leaf cellulose dCl3 averaged -26.2 (20y), -25.1 Oral Presentation Abstracts 155</page><page sequence="117">(40y), and -23.4 (450y) per mil, indicating decreased g, with tree height. Compensatory mechanisms were also observed. The leaf area:sapwood area ratio of the 450y (0.46m2cm-2;) was significantly lower than for the 40y (0.58) or 20y (0.56). Capacitance, a third compensatory mechanism, was greater in 450y than 20y trees. Despite compensatory mechanisms, hy draulic limitations to photosynthesis remain manifested in large, old Doug las-fir trees. MCGEOCH, M. A. University of Pretoria, Pretoria, 0002, South Africa. Multiple mechanism effects on the shape of patch-occupancy frequency distributions: Implications for their use as community descriptors. A variety of both artifactual and biological mechanisms have been pro posed to be responsible for the shape of empirically derived patch-occu pancy frequency distributions. Although it is over 80 years since occupancy distributions were first constructed, the debate on the role of artifactual versus biological, as well as scaling, mechanisms in shaping them has not been adequately resolved. The combined effects of mechanisms underlying the shape of occupancy distributions have also never been addressed. Here, new hypotheses are proposed that address the interaction of mechanisms, and that involve assemblage, rather than species, characteristics. Although all new and previously proposed mechanisms need further testing, spatial scale and position were identified as the primary determinants of observed patterns in the shape of occupancy distributions. The combination and iden tity of mechanisms underlying the shape of occupancy distributions change with changes in these parameters. For example, rare species properties, environmental heterogeneity, range size distributions and position within the assemblage range are all likely to contribute across a range of spatial scales. In contrast, metapopulation dynamics will only play a role at semi closed system scales. Approaches and tests to compensate for artifactual effects, and to separate the effects of potential mechanisms on the shape of occupancy distributions are suggested. However, the non-independence of many mechanisms makes the usefulness of occupancy distributions as descriptors of community distribution patterns questionable. MCGRAW, J. M. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U. S. A. Fire suppression, tree encroachment, and the spread of exotic species threaten the persistence of two endangered plants in California. In many terrestrial plant communities, fire promotes coexistence and en hances diversity by removing dominant woody vegetation. While fire sup pression has altered community structure in many fire-prone communities, efforts to restore natural fire regimes may fail due to community changes during the period of suppression. Of particular concern is the presence of exotic species not historically in the system. In the unique, edaphic san dhills community in central coastal California, fire suppression has allowed for the encroachment of Pinus ponderosa. The spatial distribution of her baceous plants, including that of two endangered species (Chorizanthe pun gens var. hartwegiana and Erysimum teretifolium), is negatively correlated with the presence of trees. To examine the mechanisms by which Pinus inhibits Chorizanthe and Erysimum, I conducted a factorial experiment test ing the effects of shade, leaf litter, and proximity to trees on the germi nation, survivorship, growth, and reproduction of the endangered species. The results indicated that leaf litter has an over-riding negative effect on the demographic success of both Chorizanthe and Erysimum. While the reintroduction of fire to reduce tree density and remove accumulated litter may benefit Chorizanthe and Erysimum, it may also facilitate exotic species which have been shown to have strong competitive effects on the native plants. A subsequent small-scale burn experiment to examine these hy pothesized direct and indirect effects of fire on Chorizanthe and Erysimum showed that fire enhances natural community diversity by disproportion ately killing exotic species.

The role of fire disturbance, climate, and atmospheric CO2 in the response of historical carbon dynamics in Alas ka from 1950 to 1995. To evaluate how historical C storage in Alaska may have been influenced by fire disturbance, climate variation, and rising atmospheric CO2 between 1950 and 1995, we conducted three simulations with the Terrestrial Eco system Model (TEM) that included responses of C storage to: CO2 only, CO2 and climate, and CO2, climate, and fire disturbance. Between 1950 and 1995, the simulations of TEM indicate that C storage in Alaska in creased between 2.0 and 2.9 1012 g (Tg) C yrl depending on assumptions of fire severity. The partitioning of effects indicate that rising CO2 was responsible for an increase in C storage of 3.6 Tg C yr' and that climatic variation was responsible for a loss of 0.3 Tg C yrl . The simulations indicate that fire disturbance, which includes changes in C storage associ ated with both fire emissions and subsequent succession, was responsible for the loss of 0.4 to 1.3 Tg C yr1 depending on assumptions for fire severity. In contrast to the overall period, historical fire disturbance ac counts for increases in C storage of between 3.1 and 10.0 Tg C yr' during the 1980s for the lowest and highest assumptions of severity, respectively. This result suggests that regrowth associated with past fire disturbance was greater than losses associated with fire emissions during the 1980s, and that the strength of the regrowth effect increases with fire severity. Our analysis suggests that fire disturbance, rising CO2 and climate variation all play substantial roles in C dynamics for Alaska, and that modeling con temporary C dynamics for boreal forests requires a temporally and spatially explicit approach that incorporates the historical effects of fire disturbance. MCINTOSH, M. E. University of Arizona, Tucson AZ 85721 U.S.A. Host plant selection in a guild of cactus-specialist bees: Pollen preferences of females foraging for larval provisions. Empirical studies of host plant selection by herbivorous insects continue to provide evolutionary biologists with important insights into the forces that shape species interactions. In particular, investigating the host range of different insect herbivores that specialize on the same plants can reveal much about the products of convergent evolution, and can also suggest the future trajectories of the evolutionary process. Specializing on cactus pollen for larval provisions has arisen independently in several bee lineages. I tested the pollen specificity of four species of these bees (Diadasia rin conis, Diadasia opuntiae, Lithurge apicalis, and Idiomelissodes duplocinc ta) by offering them cactus flowers in which the cactus pollen had been removed and replaced with other kinds of pollen. Trials were performed on free-flying bees in the field (D. rinconis, L. apicalis, and I. duplocincta), and in a field-based flight cage with marked individuals (D. opuntiae). Bees were give a multiple choice assay which always included cactus pollen as one of the choices. I found that in the populations tested, there were in dividuals of both species of Diadasia that were willing to collect novel pollen, especially pollen from Sphaeralcea (globe-mallow) flowers, which is the ancestral host for the genus Diadasia. I also found a surprising level of individual variation in foraging preferences among the marked individ uals of D. opuntiae. Individuals of I. duplocincta accepted pollen from only one non-cactus host, whereas individuals of L. apicalis rejected all non-cactus pollen. These results suggest that some populations of both species of Diadasia might contain individuals that have the potential to shift to new hosts, or to revert to the ancestral host, and also reveal that the products of convergent evolution can be quite diverse.

Differentiation in 15N uptake and the organization of an arctic tundra plant community. We used 15N soil-labeling techniques to examine how the dominant species in a N-limited, tussock tundra plant community partitioned soil N, and how such partitioning may contribute to community organization. The five most productive species were well differentiated with respect to the chemical form(ammonium, nitrate and glycine), season (June and August), and depth (3 and 8 cm) of N uptake. Species dominance (productivity) was positively correlated with the similarity between the uptake and availability of native forms of N, suggesting that competition and resource partitioning have strongly influenced &gt; &gt;the organization of this community. We are further investigating this hypothesis by examining the degree of spatial overlap among species that are similar or dissimilar in their use of N. Uptake of 156 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="118">'"N injected at different distances from individual plants showed significant interspecific differences in lateral rooting areas and a high potential for overlap of rooting areas among species. We illustrate how the "total" over lap among species can be calculated from the lateral overlap of rooting areas and the degree of ecological overlap measured by 'IN partitioning, and how this new measure of overlap can be used to test whether resource competition has contributed to the spatial structure of this community.

Recent growth in conifer species of western North America: Assessing regional and continental patterns. We explored spatial patterns of low-frequency variability in radial tree growth among western North American conifer species and identified pre dictors (elevation, longitude, latitude, species) of the variability in these patterns. We selected 185 sites from the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB), each of which contained 20-60 raw ring-width series. Using the raw ring-width series, we rebuilt two chronologies for each site using two conservative methods designed to retain any low-frequency variability po tentially associated with recent environmental change. We used factor anal ysis to identify regional low-frequency patterns in site chronologies, and estimated the slope of the growth trend since 1850 at each site from a combination of linear regression and time-series techniques. This slope was the response variable in a regression-tree model to predict the effects of environmental gradients (latitudinal, maritime-continental, elevational) and species-level differences on growth trends. Between 18 and 32 of the 185 sites demonstrated a clear pattern of increasing growth between 1850-1980 A.D., depending on the standardization technique used. Pronounced growth increases are mostly associated with high-elevation sites (above 3000 m) and high latitude sites in maritime climates. Another 27 sites from the American Southwest demonstrated a synchrony with quasi-periodic pat terns of drought. High-elevation and high-latitude sites are responding to changing environmental conditions and future research focused on these sites is necessary to identify the mechanisms responsible for directional changes in 20th century growth. MCLAUCHLAN, K. K. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108, USA. Forest clearance and plant cultivation by prehistoric people in southwestern Ohio. Despite archeological evidence that prehistoric people in North America modified the landscape through a variety of methods, including agriculture and earthworks, there is inconclusive paleoecological evidence for their impacts on local vegetation. In this study, I examined sediment cores from two small ponds constructed by the Hopewell culture as part of a 51 ha earthworks site in southwestern Ohio, USA (Fort Ancient). The 2000-year pollen record from these sediments shows that the Hopewell people dra matically modified local vegetation and maintained a deforested landscape. Sediment deposition in the ponds began at approximately 70 B.C. and 130 A.D., respectively, during Hopewell occupation of the site. During this period, both sediment cores have extremely low pollen accumulation rates, high sedimentation rates, and low organic matter content, indicating open vegetation structure with few nearby trees and high rates of erosion. Pollen assemblages during this time are characterized by over 50% pollen from herbaceous taxa, especially Ambrosia, an annual weed of open ground and agricultural fields, and known Hopewell cultigens: Chenopodiaceae, Polyg onum erectum-type, and Iva annua-type. Analysis of pollen samples from modern forests, pastures, agricultural fields, floodplains, and ditches reveals no modern analog for these pollen assemblages. The absence of modern analogs and the presence of pollen of cultigens suggest that the herb-dom inated assemblages during Hopewell times were a result of cultivation in addition to colonization of disturbed soil by weeds. This is the first time that any evidence for the location of Hopewell gardens has been found. After abandonment of the site by the Hopewell, arboreal pollen becomes more prevalent, especially oak and hickory, which are common in modern forests of the region. Hopewell activities, such as clearing trees, repeatedly disturbing the soil, causing erosion, and favoring or cultivating varieties of weedy plants, affected local vegetation at the Fort Ancient site for several hundred years. This record provides strong evidence for extensive and per sistent prehistoric human impacts on vegetation assemblages in northeast ern North America. MCPHEARSON, P. T and L. JIANG. Rutger's University, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA. Food web structure controls stability of communities with embedded mutualisms. Positive interactions among species are a potentially important, yet rela tively poorly researched area of community ecology. For example, attempts to model mutualisms in complex and even simple food webs have been limited. A central question of community ecology concerns the effects of community structure on embedded positive interactions. Are positive in teractions destabilizing, and if so, can structural properties of food webs allow for their ubiquitous persistence in nature? We simulated positive species interactions in food webs with multiple configurations ranging from simple to complex structures. The stability of communities with positive pair-wise species interactions was compared with negative pair-wise inter actions among all structure types. Stability was assessed by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. In a few food webs positive interactions stabilized otherwise unstable food webs. Stable food webs were more often desta bilized by positive interactions, though in many food webs positive inter actions had no effect on stability. Trophic position of the positive interac tion had no effect on stability whether the positive interaction was within or between trophic levels. The stability of simple food webs was often affected by positive interaction. Complex food webs, however, were more likely to experience no effect of positive interaction. Given diverse results, food web structure appears to be more important in determining community stability than either sign or trophic position of any mutualistic interaction in the food web.

Trampling of riparian habitats by large herbivores can have significant im pacts on aquatic communities. I examined numerous environmental vari ables and aquatic invertebrate community composition from paired tram pled and untrampled sites in eight first or second order streams on Antelope Island, in the Great Salt Lake, Utah. Percent mud and sand substrates were more common in trampled sites in most streams, while percentage cover of aquatic vegetation was lower in trampled sites. Of the twenty taxa com mon enough to be analyzed statistically, five showed no difference in un trampled vs trampled areas, seven had consistent differences across streams, and eight had stream x trampling level interactions. Annelid worms, ostracods, the beetle Helophorus, and the snail Physella were more common in trampled areas while the odonate Argia, the beetle Agabus, the snail Stagnicola, the dipteran Dixa, hydrophilid beetles, limnephilid cad disflies, and simulid and chironomid flies were more common in untram pled areas. These results can mostly be explained by direct trampling ef fects and indirect interactions of bison trampling affecting environmental features and substrate composition. These results suggest the need for ma magers and ranchers to control access of bison to riparian zones as is necessary for cows and sheep, even though bison wander more and spend much less total time in riparian zones.

Comparisons among the arthropod community found at the leaf litter, aerial space under the canopy and on box elder Acer negundo saplings in a hardwood forest in Maryland. As part of a study that looked at the impact of predators of Lepidoptera larvae in box elder saplings in a hardwood forest, the arthropod community was assessed to test if there were significant differences in the structure of the communities present at three distinct habitats: the forest leaf litter, the aerial space under the forest canopy and on box elder saplings. Sampled arthropods were grouped in three categories: (1) predators of Lepidoptera larvae, (2) predators of prey other than Lepidoptera larvae and (3) non predators. Percentage of arthropods found in each one of these categories was compared among the three habitats considered in the study. Unlike previous studies, arthropod samplings were performed at the same study site and during the same period of time. We found that the percentage of predators as a whole on the box elder saplings was higher than the per centage of predators occurring at the leaf litter and at the aerial space under the canopy. However, the percentage of predators of Lepidoptera larvae in Oral Presentation Abstracts 157</page><page sequence="119">the saplings was considerably lower. It was also found that none of the spider species collected in the saplings were collected in the leaf litter suggesting that the community of predators found on the leaf litter do not necessarily act as a source of predators for forest saplings as it is usually assumed.

Blowdown dynamics in oak-hickory forests of the Missouri Ozarks. We sampled 105 km of transect to determine whether oak decline has led to extensive secondary blowdown of patches &gt; 500 m2 in maturing, 50 to 90-year-old oak-hickory forests in the Missouri Ozarks. Gaps &gt;500 m2 disturbed 1.4% of the landscape per decade; for gaps 0.05- 2.5 ha, the rate was only 0.5% per decade. Twenty-eight of the 38 mesoscale gaps were clearly wind-related, whereas 10 had mainly dead-standing trees and lim ited secondary windfall. Disproportionately more gaps occurred on north and east aspects, which may be related to differences in tree density and structure. Scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea Muenchh.) was the dominant tree fall but new regeneration in blowdowns was dominated by white oak (Quercus alba L.), hickories (Carya spp. L.), and flowering dogwood (Cor nus florida L.). Although gap disturbance regime characteristics in some old-growth mesic forests may approach a quasi-equilibrium condition, sec ond-growth forests of the Ozarks appear to be in disequilibrium.

Patterns of drinking water quality violations: A broad-scale indicator of changes in aquatic ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. If one begins with an image of the classic hydrologic cycle, then the pattern of human water use appears as a subcycle appended to and impinging upon the hydrologic cycle. The primary input to the human water use system "source water" from a proximal aquatic ecosystem-undergoes chemical treatment, filtration, and disinfection by water treatment facilities, followed by distribution for human consumption and a wide range of uses. The output of the human water use system-discharge of "wastewater," treated or not-becomes a major input to the aquatic ecosystems that serve as source water for human communities downstream. An examination of pat terns of water treatment plant violations of Maximum (Allowable) Contam inant Levels (MCLs) throughout the southeastern U.S. from 1996 through 1998 was undertaken as an broad-scale indication of sustainability prob lems that are developing in aquatic ecosystems. Patterns for the four most prevalent MCL violations are examined in detail: coliform bacteria, nitrate, total trihalomethanes, and turbidity. Raw data were taken primarily from the EPA SDWIS (Safe Drinking Water Information System) database. Pat terns of coliform MCLs suggest that these violations are concentrated in coastal areas, plus central Florida and Appalachian regions. The density of coliform violations also appears to be increasing over time. Nitrate MCL violations are not common, but they do appear repeatedly over time in particular regions of the Carolinas and in central Florida. Specific agricul tural and livestock practices in these areas are suspected to be the primary cause of this problem. MEINERS, S. J.,l M. L. CADENASSO2 and S. T A.

While exotic plant invasions into disturbed communities are often associ ated with habitat degradation, long-term patterns of invasion are largely unknown. Here we present data from forty years of continuous vegetation monitoring, documenting the temporal patterns of exotic plant species in old field succession. The relative cover of exotic species decreased with time since abandonment, with significant declines occurring twenty+ years post-abandonment. The number of exotic species per plot also declined with time since abandonment while field-scale richness of exotics did not change. This suggests displacement occurring at small spatial scales. Life history patterns changed from short-lived herbaceous species to long-lived woody species for both native and exotic plant species. However, woody cover of exotic plants was dominated by shrubs and lianas while native woody cover was dominated by trees. The species richness of exotic and native species was positively correlated at most times. In abandoned hay fields, however, the proportion of exotic plant cover per plot was inversely related to total species richness. This indicates that it is not the presence, but the dominance of exotic species that reduced community diversity. While the development of closed-canopy forest appears to limit most in troduced plant species, several shade-adapted species are increasing within the fields. These invasions may cause a reversal of the patterns seen in the first forty years of succession and may result in further negative impacts on community structure. MELCHER, P.,13 F MEINZER2 and G.

Xylem cavitation thresholds and embolism repair in Hibiscus rosa as sessed with independent techniques. Xylem cavitation thresholds and diurnal variation in the frequency of em bolised vessels were evaluated in field- and greenhouse-grown plants of Hibiscus rosa using independent techniques. Xylem tension was induced by air-drying, by centrifugation of excised stems, and by allowing intact stems to undergo normal daily cycles of partial dehydration and rehydration in situ. Cavitation and embolism were estimated indirectly from variation in the hydraulic conductivity (kh) of stem segments, and directly by count ing percentages of liquid- and gas-filled vessels in images of stems previ ously frozen in liquid N2 for viewing by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM). Apparent cavitation thresholds varied according to the tech niques employed to induce tension and evaluate cavitation. At 1 MPa es timated tension, excised air-dried stems had lost 25% of their original kh, whereas kh of centrifuged stem segments was 7% greater than its original value. Centrifuged stems did not show measurable loss of kh below an abrupt tension threshold of 1.5 MPa but did show steadily decreasing weight due to increasing loss of water beginning at the smallest tensions imposed. It was hypothesized that water entering the xylem from surround ing tissues during centrifugation and subsequently lost from the segment ends may have transiently enhanced kh through partial removal of incipient emboli. Cryo-SEM images of stems subjected to centrifuge-generated ten sions showed a continuous, gradual increase in the percentage of embolised vessels from c. 2% at 0 MPa, to 7% at 1 MPa to c. 22% at 4.5 MPa. Intact stems allowed to partially dehydrate in situ appeared more vulnerable to cavitation than excised stems because loss of kh was 50%, and 16% of the vessels were embolised in cryo-SEM images, when tension was I MPa. The percentage of embolised vessels assessed by cryo-SEM varied diur nally in intact plants with a maximum value of 23% at midday and mini mum values of 5 to 7% at 0600 and 1800 h. Concurrent measurements of kh and nontranspiring leaf balance pressures indicated that vessel refilling took place when considerable tension was present in neighboring vessels. MELSER, C. and P. G. L. KLINKHAMER. Leiden University, the Neth erlands. Selective seed abortion increases offspring survival in Cynog lossum officinale (Boraginaceae). Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae) is a perennial, self-compatible spe cies. Each flower contains four ovules, but on average the seed set per flower does not exceed 1.5. By removing ovules, the seed production in the remaining ovule is increased, indicating that otherwise viable embryos are aborted. We hypothesized that by selective abortion of the seeds with the lowest fitness later in life, the maternal plant increases fitness. We investigated the selectivity of the maternal plant and the effect of selection on the lifetime quality of the offspring. Through the flowering season, the rate of seed abortion increases. This gives the potential for the maternal plant to be relatively highly selective later in the season. We pollinated maternal plants with either self- or outcross-pollen, early and late in the flowering season. A selection of the seeds was germinated.

Integrated weed management programs require a clear understanding of the mechanisms influencing the establishment, growth and reproduction of non-crop plants (weeds) in agroecosystems. This study evaluates the effect of four different agricultural management practices on the aboveground and seedbank weed communities at the KBS-LTER agricultural site, Michigan. Weed species composition and biomass was assessed over two complete 3 yr crop rotation cycles (corn-soybean-wheat) in four annual cropping treat ments: (1) high chemical input, moldboard plowed; (2) high chemical input, no tillage; (3) low chemical input, moldboard plowed; and (4) no chemical input, moldboard plowed. The abundance and composition of the viable weed seedbank was evaluated at the beginning and end of this study. Data were used to answer the following questions: i) Do management practices influence aboveground and seedbank weed community characteristics? ii) Do different agricultural practices favor the establishment of more pre dictable weed communities? iii) Is variation in the aboveground weed com munity and reflected in weed seedbank composition? Chemical input was the main factor conditioning aboveground and seedbank weed community characteristics. A multivariate ordination of the aboveground community showed that use of herbicides influenced the abundance, species compo sition and predominance of different life forms in these treatments. Peren nial herbs were most prevalent in the low and no-chemical input treatments, whereas annual grasses increased in the chemical treatments. The weed species composition in the low and no-chemical treatments was more pre dictable across years than in the high chemical treatments. Between 1993 and 1999, there was an increase in the total number of weed seeds and species in high chemical treatments. During the same period, the species richness and number of viable seeds in the seedbank declined in the no and low-chemical treatments. These results suggest that initial shifts in the abundance and composition of the weed community may not reflect the long-term dynamics of these communities under different types of agri cultural management.

Links between rocky intertidal communities and nearshore oceanic conditions in upwelling vs. non-upwelling ecosystems in New Zealand. We tested the hypothesis that variation in bottom-up effects strongly influ ences community dynamics by comparing rocky intertidal ommunities at a range of sites around the South Island of New Zealand. We predicted that micro- and macroalgal productivity and recruitment of sessile inver tebrates (mussels and barnacles) would be higher at upwelling sites and lower at non-upwelling sites. As the eastward-flowing Tasman Current ap proaches the central portion of the west coast of New Zealand, it splits into the northward-flowing Westland Current and the southward-flowing South land Current. The Southland Current wraps around the southern end of the island and flows northward along the east coast. The northern and central portions of the west coast experience intermittent coastal upwelling driven by the Westland Current; the southern portion of the west coast and the east coast lack upwelling. The abundances of ecologically-important mus sels, barnacles and sea stars, (all characterized by planktonic larval dis persal), varied differentially among sites. Mussels were abundant at central and northern sites on both coasts but were less robust on the east coast (light shells, less tissue). Barnacles were abundant at all sites except the southern east coast. Sea star predators were abundant on the west coast and rare on the east coast. At the upwelling sites, phytoplankton concentration and benthic algal biomass accumulation were greater than at all four non upwelling sites. Recruitment of barnacles and mussels, and barnacle growth rates were greatest at upwelling sites, least at east coast non-upwelling sites and intermediate at the southern west coast non-upwelling site. Predation rates on transplanted mussels were low on the east coast (nonupwelling) sites and high at the west coast (two upwelling and one non-upwelling) sites. Rocky intertidal community dynamics thus reflected both upwelling related processes (recruitment, growth rates, condition of mussels) and cur rent-related processes (recruitment, population density, predation rate).

Forest litter densities under different can opy species in the mixed conifer forest of the southern Sierra Nevada a factor affecting ground fire spread? The mixed conifer forest in the southern Sierra Nevada is a mid-elevation montane forest with a high basal area (70 m2/ha), dominated by long-lived conifers. Historically, this forest was regularly disturbed by frequent, low severity fires with ground and surface fuels as important vectors of fire spread. The mixed conifer forest is characterized by a variable species mix of two to five conifers and several hardwoods. The canopy species diversity in this forest is expected to result in a similarly variable litter base. Earlier studies of forest structure and fire history in the area revealed that topo graphic factors are important determinants of both forest structure and fire history patterns. However, the specific link between variability in forest composition and in fire regimes has not been identified. To address one possible explanatory factor we examined the density of the forest litter mat across 10,000 ha of the mixed conifer forest in the Mineral King watershed, California, to determine if the dominant canopy species would affect litter density and could thereby help regulate fire behavior. Dense litter mats, for example, retain more moisture and have low air flow, resulting in slow fire spread. We sorted our plots into those dominated by red fir (Abies mag nifica), white fir (A. concolor), sequoia or incense-cedar (Sequoiadendron giganteum and Calocedrus decurrens), and pine species (Pinus ponderosa, P. jeffreyi, P. monticola, P. contorta). Red fir litter was the densest at 0.1 1 g/cm3 (n == 30), followed by pine (0.10 g/cm3, n = 14), white fir (0.09 g/ cm3, n =57), and least dense, sequoia and cedar (0.084 g/cm3, n = 14). Significant differences in litter density were observed between red fir and white fir (p = 0.005), and between red fir and sequoia/cedar (p = 0.003). The high density of pine litter in comparison to white fir litter was unex pected. We had anticipated that pine litter, composed largely of long nee dles, would have the lowest density. Red fir had the highest variability (by coefficient of variation) in litter density, which may be an important result for explaining patchy fire behavior in that vegetation type. MESSINA, F J.,' J.

Trade-offs between plant growth and defense: A test using big sagebrush. We used intraspecific variation in big sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata, to examine the proposed trade-off between plant growth and defense. Seeds were obtained from seven geographic populations (including three subspe cies) and an artificial hybrid, and 1,120 seedlings were established in a common garden. Plants in one set of plots were either unmanipulated, sprayed with insecticide, or clipped in a way that simulated moderate or severe browsing by ungulates. A second set of plots was used to measure ambient growth and reproduction, as well as natural colonization by her bivorous insects. Plant growth varied considerably among ecotypes; we observed two-fold variation in mean relative growth rates and more than seven-fold variation in mean aboveground mass after the first growing sea son. All ecotypes showed compensatory growth (but not overcompensa tion) in response to clipping. Contrary to prediction, the degree of com pensation was unrelated to growth rate in the absence of herbivory. There was also no consistent relationship between plant growth and patterns of insect colonization, which were highly species-specific. At the level of geographic populations, we found little evidence of a built-in trade-off between inherent growth rate and the ability to tolerate or resist herbivory. MH KNOPS, J.

I explored competition between trees and grasses in an experimental garden and found that the pine tree, Pinus strobus, competitively excluded the Oral Presentation Abstracts 159</page><page sequence="121">grasses Agropyron repens and Schizachyrium scoparium. The oak tree, Quercus ellipsoidalis, competitively excluded Agropyron and coexisted with Schizachyrium. Schizachyrium plots retained nitrogen at a similar rate, e.g. 1.24 (S.D. = 0.22) g N.m-2.yrl, as nitrogen accumulates within old fields at Cedar Creek, which implies that Schizachyrium plots retain all atmospheric nitrogen inputs. Agropyron plots, in contrast, only accumulat ed nitrogen at a rate of 0.51 ? 0.05 and, most likely, did not retain all nitrogen inputs. Quercus plots accumulated nitrogen at a rate of 2.15: plusmn: 0.56, which was not significantly different from Schizachyrium plots. Pinus plots accumulated 6.62 ? 0.31 g N.m-2.yrl, which is five times more than atmospheric deposition. This accumulation, together with a high er C:N ratio of its tissue and the total C:N ratio in the plot allowed it to obtain a larger biomass than the other species. The unaccounted nitrogen input within the Pinus plots is in the order of 50 kg N.ha-'.yr' over a 6 year period, and has a different delta: 15N signature than the grasses and Quercus. This nitrogen accumulation is key in Pinus competitive ability. Two possible unaccounted input sources are asymbiotic nitrogen fixation or a much larger belowground Afootprint of Pinus that allows Pinus to exploit temporal and spatial patterns in soil mineral nitrogen availability. Thus, Pinus competitively excludes grasses because of higher biomass ac cumulation, which is ultimately controlled by access to different nitrogen pools and, in addition, partly by a higher rate of carbon accumulation per unit of acquired nitrogen.

Global change impacts on north ern U.S. forests. The altered physical and chemical environment associated with global change has increasingly affected the health and productivity of northern temperate forest ecosystems. Among the most important environmental changes in the northeast and north central U.S. are increasing concentra tions of atmospheric carbon dioxide, deposition of sulfur and nitrogen com pounds, increasing ozone exposure, disturbance, altered land-use patterns, and increasing climate variability. Since northern forest contribute an es timated two-thirds of the total U.S. accumulation of carbon in forest eco systems, maintaining these forests in a healthy and productive state will ensure their continued role as reservoirs of carbon. Experiments eith ele vated carbon dioxide demonstrated increases in tree biomass but these in creases may not compensate for ozone growth reductions. Experimental evidence support the hypothesis that soil warming of 1-3.5 degrees C will have significant effects on below ground C and N cycling in norther US forests. Generally, the combined effects of climate change and elevated carbon dioxide will increase forest productivity across the northeast and north cenetral US. MIKAN, C. J. and J. P. SCHIMEL.

Soil microbial activity in arctic tundra soils has traditionally been assumed to be minimal during frozen periods. The need to understand controls on microbial activity at low temperatures stems from recent observations that winter fluxes may account for substantial portions of annual carbon budgets in the tundra. We measured the effect of temperatures ranging from -10?C to +14?C on respiration and substrate use in 4 tundra soils of northern Alaska. An isotope equilibration approach was used to distinguish between the use of detritus vs. microbial metabolites with falling temperature. Prior to temperature manipulations, soils were labeled with 14C-glucose and in cubated for 2 months at 5?C in order to equilibrate the isotope into the active fraction of soil C, i.e. microbial biomass and products. By deter mining the specific activities of soil, biomass, and respired C pools, we measured increases in the fraction of respired C originating from microbial metabolites as temperatures fell. In wet meadow (0-5 cm), shrub, and intertussock tundra soils, the slope of Arrhenius linear transformations of respiration vs. temperature changed once, at or slightly below 0?C, sug gesting simple temperature interactions on activation energies above and below the freezing point. In contrast, Arrhenius plots of the deeper wet meadow (5-15 and 15-25 cm) and the tussock tundra soils contained sim ilar discontinuities near or below 0?C, but exhibited gradually declining slopes throughout the entire temperature range. These results suggest mul tiple interacting controls on respiration. MILLER, J. R.,' J. A. WIENS2 and N. T.

Human settlement and avian communities in lowland riparian areas. In western North America, riparian habitats have been characterized as centers of avian diversity, important to both migrating and breeding birds. Human settlement also tends to concentrate along rivers, but our under standing of the effects of settlement on bird communities is still rudimen tary. From 1995-1997, we censused birds in riparian woodlands during the breeding season at 16 locations on four drainages near the Front Range of Colorado, an area that has been experiencing rapid population growth over the last few decades. These study sites were chosen to represent a gradient of development on each drainage, as measured by the intensity of settle ment in the surrounding landscape. We found that ground cover, and native trees and shrubs decreased with settlement intensity whereas tree height, number of bridges (a measure of habitat fragmentation), and human activity in the riparian zone increased with development. Both the number of bird species and the number of individual birds were negatively correlated with settlement intensity. Although there was little similarity between avian communities at rural study sites and bird assemblages associated with the surrounding grasslands, riparian avifaunas at highly developed sites were essentially comprised of birds that are typical of developed areas in this region. Ordination analyses showed that most neotropical migrant species were associated with lower levels of settlement intensity and increases in the amount of understory. Resident bird species, however, tended to be most abundant at developed sites or were evenly distributed across the entire gradient of development. Our results indicate that human settlement exerts a strong influence on both the habitat structure of these riparian woodlands and on the bird communities found there. Moreover, our data suggest that effective conservation of avian diversity depends on careful consideration of the landscape context in which these habitats occur as well as an appreciation for the effects of human activity occurring within the riparian zone.

Effects of added water on monoculture performance and competitive relations of Bromus tecto rum and Stipa hymenoides in southeastern Utah. We conducted a field experiment to assess effects of simulated above average fall and spring precipitation on monoculture performance and com petitive relations of the exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum and the native bunchgrass Stipa hymenoides in southeastern Utah. Between 1 October 1997 and 31 May 1998, "wet" plots received 239 mm and "dry" plots received 119 mm of water representing 175 and 87 percent of average precipitation, respectively. In monoculture, added water increased fall Bro mus establishment by a factor of 1.6 but did not affect fall or winter growth. Added water adversely affected Bromus growth during early spring, but enhanced growth as soils dried during mid-spring. Overall, Bromus shoot production was 1.4 times greater in wet plots than in dry plots, with most of this difference attributable to fall establishment. During the same period, added water did not affect culm recruitment or fall growth of Stipa in monoculture. Similar to Bromus findings, added water adversely affected Stipa growth during early spring. There were no effects of added water on growth in mid- or late-spring despite enhancement of late-spring pre-dawn water potentials. Overall, added water had no effect on Stipa shoot pro duction. In plots where the two species were grown together, there were no Bromus responses to Stipa in fall, and responses to Stipa in spring tended to be more negative in wet plots than in dry plots. Conversely, Stipa responses to Bromus in spring tended to be more negative in dry plots than in wet plots. Effects of water on competitive responses were variable and statistically insignificant overall, but these results offer insights concerning likely impacts of precipitation variations on competition between these spe cies. For Bromus, a single fall of above-average precipitation should in crease establishment during both the current and the subsequent fall seasons due to effects of litter production on microsite conditions favoring recruit ment. Although above-average precipitation should enhance current-season competitive responses of Stipa, the net impact of a single wet year could be negative for Stipa due to greater Bromus competition in subsequent seasons. 160 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="122">MILLER, A.

The degree to which species within a single plant community vary in their patterns of N utilization is not well understood. In N-limited environments such as the alpine tundra, plants may utilize a diversity of N sources (or ganic and inorganic) in order to meet their nutritional requirements. To characterize species-level differences in traits related to N acquisition and use, we analyzed foliar tissue from 10 alpine species for 8'5N, N concen tration, and in vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA). Roots were examined for mycorrhizal infection, and depth of root activity was estimated from recovery of a Rb tracer injected at two depths. Results of this work and a previous '5N tracer addition conducted in the greenhouse indicate that co occurring species differ significantly in isotopic signature, NRA, and N uptake patterns, and that these differences may be more closely related to root morphology and mycorrhizal associations than to growth form. Species exhibiting the most negative 8'5N signatures in the field also showed rel atively high NRA and approximately 50% greater uptake of NO3- than NH4+, whereas species exhibiting the most positive 8'5N signatures tended to show a disproportionate uptake of NH4+. Uptake of organic N (glycine) appeared to be intermediate for most species. These data indicate that co occurring species are capable of using divergent N sources, and may rep resent one mechanism by which plants partition a limited N pool. MILLIKIN ISHIKAWA, C.

A firm conceptual grasp of energy and energy flow should help students understand many topics in ecology from food webs to plant water potentials and to global warming. Unfor tunately, introductory physics courses generally present energy in terms of work and forces and then (if time permits) in terms of thermodynamic laws and equations. At the University of California, Davis, the non-majors phys ics course uses energy as a central organizing theme. The first quarter of the 3-quarter sequence emphasizes conservation of energy and introduces a novel problem solving approach that is applied to problems involving heat, bonds, and pressure/volume changes, in addition to mechanical energy systems. Data on the effectiveness of the approach for helping students understand various ecological topices will be addressed briefly. However, the primary focus of the talk we be on how ecology and environmental science instructors could use this approach when teaching topics that re quire a conceptual understanding of energy-an understanding that students may not have gained in their traditional physics courses.

Effects of pre-dispersal predation by insects on recruitment of the grey mangrove Avicennia marina. In temperate mangrove forests in Australia, fruit of the grey mangrove Avicennia marina undergo intense herbivory by larval insects before they fall from the trees and disperse. Surveys to quantify the incidence of pre dispersal predation revealed that 53% of fruit had been damaged by larvae. We did two field experiments to test hypotheses that damage experienced by fruit while developing on the trees affects the subsequent establishment, survival, and growth of seedlings. The first experiment showed that the establishment of seedlings was not influenced by pre-dispersal predation. In contrast, the second experiment revealed that seedlings established from fruit that had undergone pre-dispersal predation were significantly shorter than those that had developed from undamaged fruit. It appears that the partial consumption of fruit before dispersal reduces the cotyledonary re serves available for the initial growth of seedlings. Importantly, pre-dis persal predation resulted in the elimination of the larger size classes of seedlings, and shorter seedlings exhibited reduced survival. These results demonstrate that pre-dispersal predation by insects is likely to play an im portant role in determining the patterns of recruitment of mangrove seed lings. MISTRY, S.

While observational inferences of pollination based on visitations can be useful, such observations do not provide an estimate of the relative efficacy of each taxa as pollinators. This study examined the pollination biology of Bombax ceiba, a large deciduous tropical tree, in India. Bombax trees pro duce large red flowers with copious amounts of nectar. The flowers nor mally stay open for two days and are visited by birds and bees during the day, and by fruit bats at night. Hand-pollination as well as day and night bagging experiments were conducted to estimate the pollination services of each group by measuring fruit and seed set. Visitation rates and damage to flowers were also measured for each taxon. Although birds visited the flowers significantly more than bats, they damaged fewer flowers during the day than bats did at night. Hand pollination studies indicated that Bom bax is a self-incompatible species, with outcrossing being the only suc cessful mode reproduction. It was not possible to ascertain the relative role of bats and birds as pollinators, because soon after the start of the bagging experiment, droves of honeybees emptied the flowers of all nectar and pollen. Much of the bee activity occurred early in the morning, before the stigmas were receptive, and is unlikely to have pollinated the flowers. Fruit set by hand pollination was significantly higher than natural fruitset, but the latter value was probably lowered by the activity of the bees. Mea surements of fruitset, seedset and other fruit and seed characteristics were also not significantly different. The results of this study suggest that both bats and birds may be important pollinators of Bombax, but that the be havior of bees is more akin to nectar robbing than pollination. MITCHELL, C. E.

Effects of experimentally excluding foliar fungal plant disease on a grassland ecosystem: linking belowground production and allocation to leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity. To test the effects of plant disease on ecosystem processes, I chemically excluded foliar fungal plant pathogens from replicated plots of late-suc cessional grassland using a fungicide spray. Fungicide treatment signifi cantly reduced the percent leaf area infected by fungi by about an order of magnitude relative to unsprayed control plots. Fungicide treatment signif icantly increased root production by 34%, and generally increased above ground production by 5-10%, although significance varied. Three years of fungicide treatment significantly increased standing root mass by 47%, and significantly increased root to shoot ratio from 1.6 to 2.3. At this time, total ecosystem carbon was 8%, but not significantly, greater in the fun gicide treated plots. Fungicide treatment significantly increased soil respi ration by 16%. Direct effects of the fungicide on the plants do not explain these results; in a companion greenhouse experiment, the only direct effect of the fungicide was to reduce root to shoot ratio in one subdominant species. Rather, these effects may be explained by increased leaf longevity and carbon gain under disease exclusion. Fungicide treatment significantly increased leaf longevity by 27% for the dominant species, Andropogon gerardi, and increased leaf longevity of three subdominant species by 4 32%, but not always significantly. Fungicide treatment significantly in creased Andropogon maximum net photosynthetic rate by 32%. This study suggests that, by reducing leaf longevity and photosynthesis, ambient levels of foliar fungal disease strongly limit belowground plant allocation in this ecosystem. MOELLER, D. A.

The influence of population size and sym patric Clarkia species on pollinator availability and reproductive suc cess in Clarkia xantiana. Community studies of plant reproductive biology have been dominated by searches for competitive interactions and character displacement among species that share pollinators. More recently, positive interactions among heterospecifics have been recognized as potentially important factors in the viability of certain populations and in the organization of plant communi ties. In addition, positive interactions among conspecifics (e.g. high density or large population size) may increase individual reproductive success.

Clarkia xantiana occurs in dis crete populations and is commonly found with as many as three other species in the genus Clarkia. These four species are similar in floral mor phology, overlap considerably in flowering time, and share a group of spe cialized pollinators. In order to confirm that coexistence among Clarkia species is common, I documented the frequency with which outcrossing populations of C. xantiana coexist with other species of Clarkia. Over 70% of outcrossing C. xantiana populations coexist with other Clarkia species in the center of the outcrosser's range. By contrast, less than 20% of out crossing C. xantiana populations coexist with other Clarkia species at the margin of the range. These results suggest that the phenomenon of coex istence among Clarkia species is common and may be important in the maintenance of outcrossing. The number of bees per plant was higher in populations of C. xantiana coexisting with other Clarkia species. Pollinator limitation of seed set was very low in large, dense populations compared with small populations or those of low density. In addition, pollinator lim itation of seed set was lower in C. xantiana populations coexisting with other species of Clarkia. These results suggest that large population size and coexisting Clarkia species positively influence reproductive success in C. xantiana and may be important in long term population viability.

Understanding the effects of rising CO2 on forest succession and diversity requires studies on how different species respond to CO2 enrichment in a forest setting. At the Duke Forest FACE site, we show that elevated CO2 increases the relative growth rate of naturally-recruited understory vines by 40% (p=0.06) and tree seedlings by 15% (p=0.05). The twenty-four tree species represent different functional groups, which respond differently to increased CO2. Shade tolerant trees under CO2 enrichment showed a 40% growth increase (p=0.03), whereas intermediately tolerant and intolerant trees showed no significant growth effects. These results suggest that in creased growth of understory trees and vines, and potentially increased turnover of early- and mid-successional understory trees, will hasten future forest succession. However, these CO2 results were confounded by the ef fects of mammalian herbivory and dispersal limitation. To isolate CO2 ef fects, seedlings of fourteen tree species (2352 trees) were planted in 1997 and protected from mammalian herbivory. Among these species, and in the absence of herbivory, there was a trend towards a 35% increase in overall relative biomass growth under CO2 enrichment. There were large differ ences between species. Liquidambar styraciflua exhibited a 70% growth increase (p=0.02); Quercus alba, a 27% increase (p=0.04); and Prunus serotina, a 20% increase (p=0.10). Liriodendron tulipifera, however, ex perienced a 35% decline in growth (p=0.05). No other species, including an N-fixer (Robinia pseudoaccacia), showed a significant growth effect. Survivorship also differed among species. Whereas elevated CO2 increased survivorship of Pinus echinata and Prunus serotina (p=0.09 and 0.10, respectively), it decreased survivorship of Quercus alba and Acer rubrum (p=0.09 and 0.10, respectively). Future CO2 effects on forest succession may be unpredictable and uncorrelated with functional groupings. MOLANO-FLORES, B.

Temporal dioecism is a synchronized flowering sequence with minimal overlap between the pistillate and staminate phases of an individual plant. This strategy allows pollen to be shed before stigmas become receptive, minimizing geitonogamous pollinations and maximizing outcrossing. I studied this condition on Eryngium yuccifolium , a tallgrass prairie peren nial species. As a temporal dioecious species, E. yufccifolium exhibits the following: 1) even with an extended pistillate phase, stigmas only become receptive after the anthers have shed pollen and dehisce, 2) synchronized flower heads, 3) numerous flower heads visited by generalist pollinators, and 4) hand pollinations indicate some degree of self-compatibility. Finally, open and caged pollinations and high pollen-ovule ratios indicated that the species is xenogamous. This study also found high fruit and seed sets (close to 90 %) for E. yuccifolium.

Leaf toughness and nitrogen content: Common currencies determining decomposition rate and performance of terrestrial detritivores? The objective of this study was to examine the influence of leaf tissue quality on performance of a terrestrial detritivore. The leaf tissues studied were collected from four tree species native to northern Portugal and three introduced tree species. The detritivore was an isopod, Porcellio dispar, endemic to north-western Spain and Portugal. Leaves were field condi tioned for six weeks prior to being used in laboratory feeding experiments. The quality of conditioned leaves was assessed using nitrogen content, polyphenol content, and leaf toughness. Variation in survivorship was not significantly correlated with any of the measures of leaf quality used in this study. Isopod consumption of leaf tissues declined as a power function of leaf toughness, while isopod growth increased as a power function of nitrogen content. Consumption and growth were not correlated with the polyphenol content of leaves. The results of this study and a concurrent study on decomposition suggest that a combination of leaf toughness and nitrogen content, may act as a common "constraint" influencing both the performance of individual detritivores and rates of decomposition, a key ecosystem process.

In ferring process from pattern: Negative frequency-dependence and the importance of spatial scale. The ability to infer process from pattern has a long history in ecology. Nevertheless, the accuracy with which patterns reflect the processes that give rise to them is hotly debated. This study uses a general spatially explicit model to explore how the scale of dispersal interacts with the scale and strength of negative frequency-dependence to determine patterns of species distribution. Counter to expectation, strong local frequency-depen dent interactions result in random spatial patterns. When dispersal scale and interaction scale are decoupled, the resulting patterns are not neces sarily random. For strong negative frequency dependence, stable bands re sult when the scale of interaction exceeds the scale of dispersal, and trav elling waves result when the scale of dispersal exceeds the scale of inter action. However, for weaker interactions occuring over intermediate scales, only random patterns result. Thus, our results call into question the utility of inferring any ecological interaction from only the spatial distributions of the putatively interacting species. Correspondingly, for populations that are spatially sub-structured, it is also not clear what the correct null model is for a spatial distribution when there are no species interactions (the neutral case). In this case, the pattern also depends on the scale of dispersal. We suggest that simple spatial models of species interactions can be used to provide the appropriate null model. MOMEN, B.,' P. D.

Use of response surface methodology and ANOVA in detecting air-pollution effects on net photosynthesis under varying temperature and light conditions. Studies of air pollution effects on plant ecophysiology under changing mi croclimate are complex requiring efficient statistical design and proper analysis to assure feasibility and correct results. We quantified effects of rain acidity and ozone on net photosynthesis (A,,) of ponderosa pine seed lings under varying temperature and light conditions. Seedlings were ex posed to combinations of rain with pH 5.1 and 3, and ambient and twice ambient ozone regimes for 14 months. Subsequently, An, of current and one-yr-old foliage was measured under nine combinations of three tem peratures (18, 25, 32 oC) and three light regimes (250, 500, 1000 1i mol photons m-2 s-'). The design was a CRD replicated twice with regard to rain-by-ozone combinations (main plots). Foliage classes were sub plots within main plots, Temperature levels were sub plots within foliage classes, and light levels were sub plots within temperature levels. This allowed the reduction of experimental units to a feasible number of eight, but resulted 162 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="124">in repeated measurements for some factors requiring identification and as signment of proper error terms to avoid pseudoreplication. Although re peated-measures ANOVA (multiway) or split-plot ANOVA (univariate) are suitable, identification and assignment of proper errors are not intuitive when multiple repeated measures exist. We used a response surface meth odology consisting of least square regression, canonical, and ridge analyses to construct quadratic, polynomial response surface models of A,, response to temperature and light levels per rain-by-ozone combination. P3temp, [temp2, Plight, A,, mean, An max, Temp. at A,, max, and Light at A,, max were calculated or estimated. The effects of rain acidity and ozone on these responses were then quantified using a two-way ANOVA, which did not require identification and assignment of any error term beyond the default mean square of error. Rain-by-ozone or ozone effect was not significant on any response. Rain with pH 3 decreased A,, mean and A,, max significantly in current-yr foliage only. MONTGOMERY, R.

Leaf-level and whole-plant assimilation as predictors of tree seedling growth across a broad light gradient. I explored leaf-level photosynthetic capacity, whole-plant assimilation rates and whole-plant carbon gain as predictors of biomass growth in tree seed lings growing across a broad light gradient in NE Costa Rica. Seedlings of Dipteryx panamensis, Virola koschnyii, and Brosimum alicastrum were transplanted along transects spanning a secondary forest-pasture edge at La Selva Biological Station. Light availability ranged from 80% to &lt;1% dif fuse transmittance. Estimates of whole-plant assimilation rates were gen erated using the three-dimensional crown architecture model, YPLANT. Leaf-level photosynthetic capacity was positively related to final biomass of seedlings of Dipteryx (R2=0.34, p=0.05) and Virola (R2=0.66, p=0.003) but not Brosimum (R2=-0.14, p=0.87). In contrast, whole-plant assimilation rates were unrelated to final biomass in all species (R2=0. 19, 0.15, and 0.13 for Dipteryx, Virola, and Brosimum respectively). Estimated whole-plant carbon gain, which adjusts whole-plant assimilation rate by seedling leaf area, was the strongest predictor of final seedling size. In creases in estimated daily carbon gain were positively related to final seed ling biomass in all three species (Dipteryx, R2=0.90, p&lt;0.0001; Virola, R2=0.89, p&lt;0.0001; Brosimum, R2=0.48, p=0.0004). Measures of whole plant carbon gain combine leaf-level acclimation, plant architecture, leaf area and plant light environment and represent an integrative measure of physiological and morphological performance. These data show that scal ing leaf-level physiology to the same level of organization (whole-plant) as growth results in a clearer coupling betweens seedling ecophysiology and growth.

Carbon fluxes within the pelagic food web of an Antarctic lake: Even slower than expected. A model was developed to simulate carbon flow through the pelagic food web of Lake Fryxell, a permanently ice-covered lake in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. This community consists of seven trophic groups: Bac teria, phytoplankton, photosynthetic nanoflagellates (PNAN), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN), bacterial-feeding ciliates, flagellate-feeding cili ates and rotifers. Respiratory rates for groups were estimated according to allometric equations based on average individual mass and total pool size, and adjusted for temperature. Carbon inputs were set equal to losses due to respiration and predation, assuming no net change in pool sizes. Relative magnitudes of carbon flows between trophic groups were similar between simulations and estimates based upon clearance rates determined in labo ratory studies. However, absolute values of fluxes were approximately an order of magnitude greater for simulations. Simulated rates of total com munity respiration also were nearly an order of magnitude higher than field observations (ca. 46.4 vs. 5.5 ugC l- d-), although the relative contribution of bacterioplankton to total community respiration was similar between observations and simulations (79 vs. 76%, respectively). These results sug gest metabolic processes of microplankton at low temperatures (ca. 2 C) are lower than could be predicted from standard allometric equations and Q,0 functions for a size-based carbon flow model.

Alligators, deer, and the evolutionary ecol ogy of a native Louisiana iris. Iris hexagona typically occurs in freshwater wetlands but a large population has colonized the saline soils of Marsh Island, Louisiana. Irises are bumble bee pollinated and produce big blue flowers and huge seed pods. They also reproduce clonally through stout, branching rhizomes. We report here on field experiments, allozyme studies, and phytochemical analyses that sug gest a link between alligators, deer, and the evolutionary ecology of I. hexagona. Most Marsh Island irises cannot reproduce sexually because of heavy flower predation by white-tailed deer. Alligators are abundant and prey on the deer, which avoid flowering plants on the water's edge. These edge plants develop normal seeds that can disperse via the island's bayous and tidal channels. Iris clonal patches vary in tolerance to salinity, which affects plant chemistry and resource allocation. Salinity increases iris seed production, and developing seeds contain high concentrations of abscisic acid (ABA), a plant growth regulator associated with stress tolerance. This maternal effect may increase germination success, because seeds from sa linity-exposed plants germinate more readily than seeds from non-stressed plants. By eliminating iris flowers and sexual reproduction, deer can reduce genetic variation in the plant population and prevent maternally induced salinity tolerance. However, deer may also benefit irises because plants whose flowers were removed produced 24% more belowground biomass than unbrowsed plants. This could enhance iris survival on Marsh Island, where erosion is an important threat. Alligators, by discouraging floral predators, may help sustain a balance between sexual reproduction and rhizome allocation, and indirectly influence I. hexagona survival and ad aptation in the salt marsh environment. MORALES, M. A. and D. W. INOUYE. University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA. The effect of snowpack on the timing and abun dance of flowering in the montane plant, Delphinium barbeyi. Many montane species are insulated from the damaging effects of frost by snowpack. For these species, predicted changes in precipitation associated with global climate change may have a significant impact on populations in ways unrelated to temperature. Of special interest are plants that flower at the beginning of the growing season, because these species are especially susceptible to frost damage, but may also help attract and support polli nators that then service later-flowering plants. Generally, global climate change may have a disproportionate effect on montane communities, be cause species in these habitats may not be able to respond to change in temperature with a shift in latitudinal range, and because area decreases as altitude increases. Unfortunately, the response of many species to variation in climate remains largely unpredictable. One approach is to correlate pop ulation level response of organisms to annual variation in environmental conditions. Previous studies have detected a link between variation in snowpack and the timing and abundance of flowering during the subsequent summer for the early-flowering montane plant Delphinium nelsonii (Ran unculaceae). We used a long-term data set collected at the same site (Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, 2800 m) to study variation in the timing and abundance of flowering for the long-lived perennial species Delphinium barbeyi, which flowers in mid-season, over the period from 1975 to 1999. Results show that snowpack is positively correlated with both the density of stems and the timing of flowering. Similarly, timing of flowering and stem density are positively correlated with flower abundance. In contrast, snowpack alone explains none of the residual variance in flower abundance. These results suggest that snowpack influences flowering in D. barbeyi by two different mechanisms. In the first, snowpack increases the density of stems. In the second, snowpack delays the timing of flowering, and there fore protects flowers from the damaging effects of early season frosts. These results suggest that changes in precipitation associated with global climate change may have a significant impact on populations of this spe cies. MORGAN, J. A.,' G. E. SCHUMAN2 and T. G.

Our in terest in this study is with two grasslands which lie within 40 miles of each other and represent vast expanses of the Great Plains, the shortgrass steppe (SGS) and the northern mixed prairie (NMP). Two bowen ratio/energy balance stations were installed in late March 1998, one at the USDA ARS Central Plains Experimental Range, a SGS in northeastern Colorado, and the other at the USDA-ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station, a NMP just west of Cheyenne, WY. Fluxes of CO2 were measured for 20 minute intervals throughout the growing season and into the late autumn until stations were dismantled in late November. Although productivity of the NMP is approximately twice that of the SGS, aboveground peak stand ing phytomass was similar at both sites in 1998, averaging 131 g m-2 on the NMP and 133 g m-2 on the SGS. The total amount of C assimilated from late March through November was considerably higher on the SGS site, with 138 g C assimilated compared to only 49 g C assimilated on the NMP. Seasonal and site-related patterns of C assimilation were controlled to a large extent and are explained in terms of soil water dynamics. MORRIS, S. J.,' S. HAILE-MARIAM,' S. BOHM,' J. SIX,2 K.

SOM dy namics and afforestation: Species affects and implications for global change. Afforestation of agricultural lands is important for sequestration of C in mitigating the effects of elevated CO2 on global change. Tree biomass is the predominant sink for C, but 30% of the sequestered C may be in the slow and resistant soil C pools. Afforestation increases soil and plant N at rates that exceed deposition inputs. We measured soil C and N sinks and evaluated the role of specific tree species in controlling C and N seques tration in soils and above and belowground forest biomass. Sites with na tive forests, agriculture, afforested deciduous and afforested coniferous on the same soil type were sampled for profile C and N to a depth of lm. An acidic loam deciduous soil in Michigan, sequestered 0.35 Mg C ha-lyr-' and 0.03 Mg N ha-lyr'. The N inputs were much higher than could be accounted for in precipitation. A sandy, deciduous Ohio site sequestered 0.50 Mg C ha-lyr' and 0.02 Mg N ha-lyr'. Afforested, coniferous MI and OH stands did not show increases in C and N over the agricultural com parison. In contrast, afforested coniferous sites on calcareous till in Canada showed storage of C and N. Understanding the effect of this species-texture interaction on C and N sequestration is essential for evaluating the global C budget and the effects of N deposition on afforested soils. MOYLE, L.

The biological consequences of rarity (i.e. small population size and/or patchy distribution) are thought to be contingent upon the evolutionary and ecological history of a given taxon. One specific consequence of numerical rarity may be reduced fitness resulting from insufficient cooperative inter actions between conspecifics i.e., Allee effects. Species with a history of rarity may be expected to be less susceptible to Allee effects. We used a comparative approach to investigate differences in population demography and genetics of four species in the herbaceous plant genus Silene, two of which are common/widespread and two of which are geographically re stricted. Multiple populations, spanning a range of sizes, were examined for each species. Demographic characters included survival and reproduc tive output in the field; genetic factors included susceptibility to inbreeding depression. One goal was to determine whether Allee effects differentially affected rare versus common species. Results suggest that while both rare and common species experience some negative consequences of small pop ulation size (for example, individual seed weight is positively correlated with population size), species with historically widespread distributions are no more susceptible to these effects than rare congeners. Thus, there is no evidence that historically rare species of Silene have developed adaptive strategies that mitigate the negative effects of small population size. MULDER, C. P. H. I and D.

Effects of disturbance on relationships between species richness and ecosystem processes: Using bryophyte communities as model systems. The importance of high species diversity to the full functioning of ecosys tems subjected to repeated disturbance or environmental variation remains unclear. We are using bryophyte communities to examine relationships be tween species richness and ecosystem processes in disturbed and undis turbed communities. Forty species of mosses and liverworts were collected from one valley near Akatarawa, New Zealand. Two-hundred and eight communities were created with seven levels of diversity (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32 species) and 104 unique mixtures. Pieces of each species were planted in random grid patterns in each 40 by 60 cm tray. Two replicates of each mixture were created; one replicate was kept under good conditions (high moisture and low light) while the other was subjected to repeated distur bance (drought, flooding and frost). Detailed spatial information will allow us to identify mechanisms underlying results. Unlike in vascular plant com munities, pre-disturbance results showed no relationship between species richness and percent cover, and for only one species did its presence sig nificantly increase percent cover. Decomposition of cotton strips could also not be explained by diversity or the species mixture but was negatively related to percent cover. Comparing these relationships in undisturbed com munities with those in disturbed communities will allow us to determine whether the value of high species richness for ecosystem function emerges under environmental variation.

Below ground respiration rates in forests can be determined at whole-catch ment scales using stream CO2 measurements. Belowground carbon dynamics are poorly understood for many ecosystems in part because of a lack of appropriate methods for determining soil res piration rates. CO2 evasion rates from soils have been measured using small chambers, but whole ecosystem assessments are hindered by high spatial and temporal variability in chamber measurements. A micrometeorological method (eddy covariance) has been developed to determine soil CO2 eva sion rates at larger spatial scales, but the instrumentation costs are high and there are problems with measurements at night due to reduction in turbu lence and air drainage in hilly terrain. We have developed a new, whole catchment approach for determining CO2 efflux (evasion to the atmosphere plus hydrological losses) that uses measurements of streamwater chemistry, and a model that accounts for CO2 consumption during carbonate weath ering and CO2 evasion and metabolism within the stream. Soil CO2 evasion rates determined using the stream CO2 approach were similar in terms of seasonal pattern and absolute values to CO2 evasion rates determined from eddy covariance measurements just above the forest floor in Walker Branch Watershed, a small forested catchment in eastern Tennessee. These results suggest that the stream CO2 approach can be an important new tool for determining soil respiration rates at relatively large spatial scales. MULITSCH, M. J., L. L. PIERCE, F G.

Impacts of different farm management practices on nitrogen pollution of ground and sur face water in Central California: Evaluation and application of BGC ecosystem model. One of the most important environmental issues facing Central California is surface and groundwater N pollution. These high levels of N in many watersheds of the Monterey Bay, CA are derived from agricultural pro duction. Addressing this issue requires understanding the impact of current farm management practices on N leaching, but many empirical studies are limited by time and resource constraints. The BOC ecosystem process mod el was adapted to Monterey Bay agricultural conditions and then used to predict short to medium-term effects of lettuce production, cover crops, and vegetative buffer strip usage on N pollution of ground and surface water. Simulation results suggest that aboveground C production, or lettuce 164 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="126">vield, and N leaching predicted by the model provide a good relationship with field measured data. Results suggest that cover crops planted during the winter fallow period can reduce soil N leaching into groundwater. Re sults also show a relationship between large pulses of N lost from agri cultural systems during initial rain storms in the fall due to accumulated soil N during the spring and summer months. Although cover crops may not be planted at the time of initial rains, other farm management practices such as planting riparian or grass vegetative buffer strips between farm fields and waterways can effectively remove N from groundwater and sur face runoff. A combination of cover crops and vegetative buffer strips may have significant effects on N lost from these agricultural systems. MUNGER, G. T and R. E. WILL.

The influence of photosynthetic capacity and leaf area on growth differences associated with fertilization and competition control in Pinus taeda L. stands. Growth of forest stands is strongly influenced by nutrient availability. As part of a comprehensive study exploring the biological potential of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands through yearly nitrogen fertilization and elim ination of competing vegetation across a range of sites and stand ages in Georgia, we assessed the relative role of leaf area and light saturated pho tosynthetic rate on treatment-induced increases in stand growth . Fertiliza tion and competition control had significant positive effects on litterfall based estimates of stand leaf area. Annual litterfall surface area (all-sided) was 3.72, 5.54, 5.76, and 7.18 m2 m-2 of plot area for the Piedmont site and 5.00, 7.46, 5.46, and 8.20 m2 m-2 at the Coastal Plain site, for check, fertilization, competition control, and fertilization + competition control treatments, respectively. No clear pattern in light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat) was associated with the treatments. Mean values of Asat taken over five measurement periods from April 1999 to December 1999 were 2.61, 2.51, 2.49, and 2.41 micromol m-2 s-' at the Piedmont site and 3.55, 3.51, 3.32, and 3.40 at the Coastal Plain site, for check, fertilization, com petition control, and fertilization + competition control treatments, respec tively. We conclude that differences in growth associated with fertilization and competition control were mediated by leaf area, not by the light sat urated photosynthetic capacity of the foliage. MURPHY, N. and C. E. NELSON. Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, U.S.A. Distribution and coexistence of two terrestrial salaman der species: A difference in desiccation physiology. Plethodontids are small, lungless, terrestrial salamanders that must keep their skin moist for respiration. This makes them especially susceptible to desiccation. Cover objects on the forest floor that provide moist, cool re fugia are aggressively defended by resident individuals. In previous work where two similar species compete for cover objects, local areas of com petitive exclusion are the result. Plot sampling in the springs of 1997 and 1998 demonstrated that Plethodon cinereus and P. dorsalis coexist broadly and syntopically in south-central Indiana. P. dorsalis was captured signif icantly less frequently in dryer habitats and during the drier of the two years. These data suggested that P. dorsalis was more sensitive to desic cation. In lab experiments, P. dorsalis did desiccate more quickly than P. cinereus. The field and lab data together suggest that P. dorsalis probably retreats underground sooner than P. cinereus to avoid desiccation. This may provide a temporal release from competition for P. cinereus allowing these two species to coexist syntopically. MURPHY, P. J. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. Are male and female frogs equally choosy when selecting repro ductive sites?-Experiments show females override calling males based on risks to offspring. Females and males often face different selective pressures when choosing reproductive sites. Site quality for offspring may be weighed more heavily by females if juvenile stages complete development within a single site. Males, however, may discount site quality, particularly in species in which males display and compete for females and displays are costly and increase predation risk. In Edalorhina perezi, a tropical frog that reproduces in iso lated lowland pools, I assessed reproductive site choice by adults of both sexes through a mark-recapture study and controlled choice experiments in the field. In choice experiments, I manipulated three risk factors to off spring-insect predator density, tadpole competitor density, and pool depth-and tested male choice of calling site and female choice of ovi position site. In an additional experiment, I restricted calling males to sites of either high or low quality to offspring and gave females a second option for oviposition that was of better, equal, or poorer quality than the male calling site. Results of the mark-recapture study demonstrated that the larg est males had higher mating success at established pools of high quality for offspring, while smaller males achieved more matings by moving among pools that varied greatly in quality. Female size did not correlate with pool quality nor a tendency to move among pools. Experimentally, both males and females preferred sites lower in predation and drying risk to offspring. The results suggested, however, that males were less choosy than females when pools differed in densities of tadpole competitors. In addition, females overrode male calling site when a nearby pool was less risky to offspring. This study supports the contention that Edalorhina per ezi females weigh reproductive site quality more heavily than males and suggests that a conflict between mate choice and reproductive site choice may occur for females in this species and in other species with similar reproductive ecology. MUSICK, J. A. Virginia Institute of Marine Science, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA. Threatened and endangered marine fishes in North Amer ica. The threat of extinction in marine fishes has been considered to be remote by most workers. However recent studies have shown that more than 60 marine fish stocks may be at risk in North American waters. Our initial analyses of the status of these stocks suggest that species at risk usually fall into one of two categories: 1.) Those with restricted range and spe cialized habitats; or 2.) those with very low intrinsic rates of increase(r). We recognized at least four geographic hotspots where multiple populations are at risk: The Indian River Lagoon (4 species) and Keys areas in Florida (3 species), the Gulf of California (4 species), and Puget Sound (16 spe cies). Most habitat-limited species tend to be small, and life-history-limited species tend to be large in size. Five species of sturgeons (Acipenseridae) were found to be particularly at risk because they have low increase rates and are anadromous. Thus, their spawning and nursery habitats have been subjected to severe degradation. Other species with very low intrinsic rates of increase that have exhibited 80-90% declines because of fisheries in clude 9 species of sharks and rays (Elasmobranchi), 10 species of groupers (Serranidae) and 15 species of Pacific Rockfishes (Sebastinae). Such groups are particularly at risk in multi-species fisheries where those species with high r may support harvesting at high levels while those with low r taken incidentally are driven to extirpation.

We propose that Alliaria petiolata an invasive, exotic plant attains a com petitive advantage over native understory plant species by actively growing and achieving high maximum rates of photosynthesis in early spring when the majority of native understory species are still dormant. The rates of photosynthesis for a population of Alliaria petiolata were measured in sum mer, fall, and early and late spring using the LI-COR 6400 infared gas analyzer. Measurements of native understory cover were made at 3-4 week intervals from early April to late May. In Early spring (March 24) before substantial native understory development occurred, the maximum rate of photosynthesis was 8.2 + 1.1 p.mols m-2s-1. The maximum photosynthetic rate increased to 17.8 ? 0.6 on 6 April and then declined during May, being 8.8 ? 0.3 and 4.7 ? 0.4 on May 3 and 24, respectively. Maximum photosynthetic rates were negatively correlated with understory cover from the early April sample through May (r = 0.999, P = 0.0057). The ability of Alliaria petiolata to achieve maximum rates of photosynthesis before the active growth of native understory species appears to provide it with a competitive advantage, which may contribute to its successful spread and eventual domination of a forest understory.

Differential antipredatory responses of two similar species of fish to introduced brown trout. Escape response was measured for two native species of fish, leatherside chub (Gila copei) or redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus), to a simu lated attacking brown trout, an introduced predator. An octagon shaped arena was set up with a diameter of 58 cm. The center of the arena con tained a 10 cm diameter clear Plexiglas holding chamber that could be retracted through the bottom of the chamber. A single individual of either species was placed in the holding chamber. Once the prey had acclimated and was facing within a 45o angle of where the trout would come out, the Plexiglas holding chamber was lowered and a trigger was tripped, releasing the simulated trout. Directly over this arena, a Panasonic digital video cam era was set up, which recorded the entire sequence of events. Later the tape was reviewed and 3 responses were measured. These included speed (the distance from the position of the fish when it first reacted to the po sition of the fish when the attack was over/time), direction (the angle be tween the fishes initial position and where it ended up with 0 being directly toward the trout), and reaction distance (the distance between the predator and prey when the prey first reacted to the predator). The size of each fish was also measured to account for differences in responses of these variables due to the size of the fish. Leatherside chub and redside shiner differed significantly for all 3 variables. Redside shiner tended to move toward the predator while leatherside chub tended to move away from the predator. Redside shiner had a longer reaction distance than leatherside chub, mean ing that redside shiner reacted to the predator when the predator was further away. Finally, leatherside chub had a significantly faster speed than redside shiner. Though the two species differ in their reaction to an attacking pred ator it is unclear which strategy is more effective. Are redside shiner slower because they react quicker to the predator and thus don't need to move fast? Are leatherside chub faster because the predator is closer to them when they react and does this increased speed make up for the difference in reaction distance? These questions should be tested in experiments that measure mortality of these species in the presence of brown trout and look for differences in mortality between these two species.

Fugitive species are not always competitively inferior: Evidence for a shift in competitive hierarchy following soil disturbance in a grassland plant community. Although it has been well documented that species composition changes following a disturbance, the processes responsible for these changes are less well understood. The often-assumed idea of competitive reduction, that disturbance, by removing neighbor biomass, allows species that are inferior competitors but superior colonists to persist, has rarely been tested. We suggest an alternative: By changing neighborhood and abiotic conditions, a disturbance can shift competitive rankings of species. We tested these hypotheses by assessing the competitive response abilities of three prairie species representative of varying disturbance regimes in both gap (simu lated soil mound disturbances) and matrix (undisturbed prairie) conditions. We found that gap creation has little effect on survival competitive hier archies, and these rankings are similar to species' relative abundances in matrix conditions. However, for growth, a well-defined hierarchy was bro ken down to conditions of competitive equivalence following a disturbance. These results indicate that the assumption of competitive reduction is not entirely justified. We also teased apart the effects of several aspects of a disturbance to assess whether it is neighbor biomass or other changes as sociated with gap creation that are responsible for the change in competitive rankings. In a factorial design, we measured how changes in neighborhood conditions (neighbor biomass, neighbor identity, size-structure) and chang es in abiotic soil conditions (mound formation) affected competitive hier archies. Although the reduction of neighbor biomass associated with a dis turbance decreased competitive intensity, it did so similarly for all species. No change in any neighborhood characteristic affected the growth com petitive hierarchy. In contrast, changes in abiotic soil conditions (decreased compaction and soil moisture associated with mound formation, regardless of neighborhood) shifted the competitive hierarchy to competitive equiva lence. In addition to neighbor biomass removal acting to decrease the in tensity of competitive interactions (as predicted by competitive reduction), changes in abiotic conditions may act to change the nature of competitive interactions following a disturbance.

Abundance and frequency of Lycopodium species under various forest management regimes in northern hardwood forests. Several Lycopodium or club moss species are extensively collected as non timber forest products, are marketed for production of traditional and sea sonal decorations, and are used in the floral and horticulture industries. Impacts of forest management practices on populations of Lycopodium spe cies are not well understood. Our objective was to use analysis of variance and regression analysis to describe the relationships between treatment re gimes and percent cover and frequency of occurrence of Lycopodium spe cies in northern hardwood forests. Correlation analysis was used to deter mine the relationship between basal area and Lycopodium cover. Three managed (old growth, even-age, uneven-age) and two unmanaged (old growth and second growth) forest management regimes were used in this study. Ten, 5 by 5 m2 plots were randomly located within each replicate stand of each management regime, for a total of 130 plots. Two-thirds of the Lycopodium present was found in the managed even-age and unman aged old growth stands. Highest frequency of occurrence and percent cover values existed in the unmanaged old growth, managed even-age, and un managed second growth, respectively, with no statistical difference among them. Highest frequency and percent cover occurred under the management regimes with highest measured basal area.

Organic nitrogen deposition; Is it time to reconsider the measurement of N in precipitation? Organic forms of nitrogen are widespread in the atmosphere and the de position of these compounds may contribute to the input of atmospheric N to ecosystems. However, atmospheric organic nitrogen (AON) is also in frequently measured and the processes that lead to the formation of organic nitrogen compounds are only partially understood. In this presentation, we summarize and synthesize data from 41 measurements of the concentrations and fluxes of AON. On average, organic N accounts for about one third of the total atmospheric N flux or concentration. The percentage contribution of organic N to total N loading varies from site to site and with measure ment methodology but is consistently around a third of the total N load with a median value of 30% (Standard Deviation of 16%). There are no indications that AON is a proportionally greater contributor to N deposition in unpolluted environments and there are not strong correlations between fluxes of nitrate and AON or ammonium and AON. Possible sources for AON include byproducts of reactions between NOx and hydrocarbons, both of which are can be affected by human activity. Potentially important nat ural contributions of AON including marine and terrestrial sources of re duced (amino acid) N and long range transport of organic matter and bac teria. The reduced and bacterially-related forms of AON do not appear to play an important role in the overall flux of AON to the surface of the earth; however both dust and oxidized organic N species such as peroxy acetyl nitrates may be important. Our preliminary estimate of the magni tude of global AON fluxes places the flux between 10 and 50 Tg of N per year with substantial unresolved uncertainties but clear indications that AON deposition could be an important component of both site and global N balance. 166 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="128">NELSON, D.

Impact of white-tailed deer foraging on prairie forbs. t Goose Lake Prairie State Park, northeastern Illinois, we sampled perma nent deer exclosures and adjacent unprotected plots to determine 1) the impact of deer exclusion on flowering and diversity of prairie forbs, and 2) the relationship between inorganic nutrient content of plant tissue and intensity of browse on 9 forb species. Following sampling in 1992, deer were excluded from one half of the plots. We tested for differences between protected and unprotected plots, in forb diversity (1992, 1994, 1997, and 1999) and flowering stem densities (1998 &amp; 1999). Prior to construction of exclosures in 1992, the Shannon diversity index was higher (p&lt;0.05) in plots that became the unprotected control plots than those eventually protected from deer, but 5 and 7 years later the diversity index was higher in exclosed plots (p&lt;0.05). In 1998, mean number of flowering stems (all species pooled) was greater in plots where deer were excluded (Pr&gt;F=0.006), but there was no significant difference in 1999 (Pr &gt;F=0.794), after deer control reduced the herd by 32%. Mean number of flowering spikes/plant and height of Amorpha canescens were significantly greater in protected plots in 1997 but not in 1999. Browsing intensity was positive correlated with plant tissue N concentration and negatively cor related with K concentration. NELSON, W. A.,' E. MCCAULEY1 and E J.

The influence of ge netic diversity and temperature on the dynamics of freshwater pred ator-prey systems. The impact of temperature on the population dynamics of predator-prey systems is difficult to predict even when the response of the individuals is known. We tested both, the effect of temperature on the population dynam ics of the zooplankton-phytoplankton predator-prey system, and the capac ity of zooplankton genetic diversity to modify the systems response. Using Daphnia pulex and a mixture of edible green algae, we closely followed the population dynamics of sixty-six tanks for many generations. The treat ments were either 15?C or 25?C with either single or multiple zooplankton clones. Theory predicts a wide range in population dynamics and equilibria for the zooplankton-phytoplankton system when non-linear predator and prey responses are used. This wide range of dynamics was observed in these tanks with the same general trend that is expected for temperature dependent vital rates. Specifically, low temperature tanks had more stable population dynamics, in terms of temporal variation in abundance, and some replicate tanks displayed very high prey equilibria with very low predator equilibria. High temperature tanks displayed greater instability in temporal dynamics, including evidence of limit cycles with high predator abundance and low prey abundance. Genetic diversity had a much larger effect at 15?C where multiple clone tanks were frequently at an entirely different equilibrium than single clone tanks. Multiple clones at 25?C did have a stabilizing effect on the equilibrium dynamics but not as large an effect as seen at 15?C. The wide range of dynamics observed, and the agreement with theory, demonstrates that zooplankton and phytoplankton interact and respond to temperature in a complex and non-linear fashion. These results reveal that genetic diversity may influence the dynamical complexity observed in predator-prey systems. NESS, J. H., C. R. CARROLL and H. R. PULLIAM.

The term "induced resistance" describes a reduction in a herbivore's sur vival rate or reproductive output that is attributable to a response by the host plant. Induced resistance has been documented in a variety of biolog ical systems, and most examples describe some internal alteration within the attacked plant that subsequently exerts a direct effect upon the attacker. However, a plant's defense may extend well beyond these "one-to-one" interactions to incorporate the recruitment of a herbivore's predators and parasitoids. We manipulated damage levels on Catalpa bignonioides (Big noniaceae) seedlings in order to evaluate whether the ants that visit the plant's extrafloral nectaries would respond as an inducible defense against a specialist herbivore, Ceratomia catalpae (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). Ants (Dolichoterine spp.) recruited more strongly to leaves that experienced her bivory and/or were occupied by caterpillars in comparison to undamaged leaves, and the initial level of recruitment was positively correlated with damage levels. Exclusion experiments indicated that ant predation can have a significant effect on caterpillar mortality rates, and thus recruitment to damaged leaves may act as an inducible defense on the behalf of the host plant. The cues that elicit this behavior remain unclear. The ant's response to mechanically damaged leaves was similar to that for undamaged leaves, suggesting that the ant response was linked to herbivory rather than simply damage per se.

The role of soil amino acids in the structure and functioning of upland grassland swards in Great Britain. The agriculturally important grasslands that constitute the upland of Britain generally occur on nutrient poor soils where soil nitrogen mineralization cannot provide all of the nitrogen requirements for plants. Understanding the role which organic forms of nitrogen, such as amino acids, play in determining the structure and function of upland swards is vital for UK agricultural management. To assess the importance of soil amino acids to upland grasslands we documented the temporal and spatial patterns of soil amino acids and the role of amino acids in nitrate uptake, growth, and competitive interactions of key species. We examined soil amino acid con tent from five upland sites throughout Britain representing three levels of fertilization. We also investigated nitrate uptake in key species in the pres ence of amino acids, and examined the growth and competition of grassland sward species in the presence of amino acids by treating potted plants with nitrate and/or amino acids. Amino acids tended to decrease as fertility of the soil increased. This pattern correlated with the level of microbial activ ity at these sites, where high microbial activity indicates high concentra tions of total free amino acids. There was a gradual increase in total free amino acid concentrations from January-March with the highest amino acid content found in the late spring months (April and May) followed by a drop-off through the summer months. As little as 4[tM of arginine or gly cine significantly decreased the nitrate uptake ability of Lolium perenne, a graminoid which dominates improved grassland swards in the uplands. In contrast, IOpLM of arginine or glycine significantly increased the nitrate uptake ability of Holcus lanatus, a species that dominates semi-improved pastures. Arginine significantly reduced the growth rate and competitive ability of L. perenne, while having no significant effect on H. lanatus. The crucial role that amino acids play in determining species composition of upland grassland swards is quite clear. Some species flourish in the pres ence of amino acids while others decline, and it is possible that the amount of soil amino acids in pastures and grasslands can be used as a predictor of future species composition.

Mycorrhizae determine compensa tory responses of American and French Centaurea maculosa after clip ping. Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed) is a non-native, invasive plant in North America that is native to Europe and Asia. We investigated the re sponses of C. maculosa collected from the US to clipping, mycorrhizae, and interspecific competition with Festuca idahoensis. In a greenhouse ex periment, we planted North American C. maculosa with or without F. idahoensis and with or without mycorrhizae in North American soil. We simulated herbivory by clipping all C. maculosa leaves, except one, in half of the pots. We found interactions between neighbor and mycorrhizae (P=O.003) and mycorrhizae and herbivory (P=O.055). In the absence of mycorrhizae, C. maculosa's biomass was negatively affected by clipping with or without F. idahoensis. In contrast, C. maculosa had a compensatory growth response to clipping in the presence of mycorrhizae both in the presence and absence of F. idahoensis. In a similar experiment, we com pared the responses of C. maculosa collected from the US to C. maculosa collected in France to clipping. Both Centaureas were planted either alone Oral Presentation Abstracts 167</page><page sequence="129">or with the French grass, Festuca ovina, in French soil, with or without mycorrhizae. We found strong positive effects of mycorrhizae (P&lt;0.001) and F. ovina (P=0.023) on Centaurea biomass. In the absence of mycor rhizae, both the American and French C. maculosa compensated for clip ping with or without F. ovina. However, the biomass of both Centaureas was negatively affected by clipping in the presence of mycorrhizae and F. ovina. Our results suggest that fungal and microbial communities in the soil differ between North America and Eurasia and may affect the response of C. maculosa to herbivory. The compensatory growth response by C. maculosa has implications for the use of insects as biocontrols. NI, W.,' R. DUBAYAH' and J.

Modeling lidar waveforms using a geometric and optical radiative tranfer model for discontinuous plant canopies. Recent studies have explored the use of lidar remote sensing for retrieving forest structural characteristics in anticipation of the launch of NASA's Vegetation Canopy Lidar, a space-based mission that will provide a global sampling of vertical canopy structure. While field-based comparisons have had good success in relating lidar data to parameters such as canopy height, canopy closure, and biomass, among others, physically-based remote sens ing models are necessary to better understand and interpret the interaction of lidar energy with the canopy. A Geometric Optical and Radiative Trans fer (GORT) model for estimating the radiation environment within discon tinuous plant canopies previously has been used to model canopy lidar waveforms for single layer, single species coniferous forests where trees are highly clumped. In order to apply GORT to plant canopies with more complicated canopy structure, we have extended it to model lidar returns from clumped multiple layers with multiple species. The model is validated using data acquired by the airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). By allowing us to model lidar waveforms based on the physical principles of radiative transfer, GORT provides a needed link between ob served and actual canopy vertical structure. NICHOLAS, N.

Forest decline as sessment of northern hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians. Recently released reports by several environment stakeholder groups have focused on the health of the northern hardwood forest in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of VA, NC, and TN. Their findings indicate that obvious damage was limited to elevations above 1370 m and suggested that the northern hardwood forest of the southern Appalachians is in an advanced stage of decline. According to their data, a number of hardwood species exhibit similar decline symptoms with no primary pathogens in evidence. Their reports have linked the forest condition to high levels of air pollution. While significant long-term monitoring has been conducted in the region's high elevation spruce-fir ecosystem, there has been little baseline information published in peer reviewed journals on the region's northern hardwood forest. This study was designed to provide well docu mented data sets with a design that allows for long-term analysis so that northern hardwoods forest health issues could be viewed within the context of scientific literature. The study objectives were to complete a forest con dition assessment in areas of reportedly high forest damage and evaluate stands for damage due to abiotic and biotic stressors. The project to date has consisted of two sampling efforts: 1) an intensive permanent plot sys tem based on a stratified random sampling design (stratified by elevation and macro-aspect) in areas reported to have forest damage, and 2) a sys tematic sampling of the overstory across regional northern hardwoods for ests. Our presentation will give an overview of overstory community struc ture and indices of current stand health. We found that overstory species composition changes rather significantly with an increase in elevation. At lower elevations, the forest is dominated by sugar maple (-- 50 % of the live basal area (LBA)) and American beech (32% LBA). In contrast at higher elevations, the forest is dominated by yellow birch (38 % LBA) and American beech with 23% of the LBA and sugar maple makes up less than 10% of the overstory. Eleven % of standing trees are dead, most are birch and beech at the higher elevations. Within the next year, metadata from this study will be made available to all interested scientists to facilitate comparison and collaboration of information on this northern hardwoods ecosystem.

Spatial pattern ing of pigmentation in evergreen leaves in response to freezing stress. Evergreen leaves of temperate climate plants are often subject to frosts that affect photosynthesis. Changes in carbon gain patterns arise from freezing related tissue damage, and from interactions between light and temperature stress. We examined relationships between spatial patterns in freezing and concentrations of chlorophyll and anthocyanin, a protective pigment. Pat terns of freezing in intact, attached leaves of the treeEucalyptus pauciflora (the "snow gum" of alpine southeast Australia) were studied with infra-red thermal imaging. As leaves were cooled at 20C per hour, freezing was observed to initiate at the midvein area near the petiole and spread through out the leaf-the rate depending on the shape, thickness and water content of the leaf. The combined effects produced spatial gradients in freezing temperatures within leaves that would be expected to influence spatial pat terns in freezing damage. Spatial patterns in pigmentation in leaves that had been exposed or protected from naturally occurring frosts were deter mined by conventional extraction techniques combined with high resolution hyperspectral imaging of reflectance from intact leaves. Predictive indices (r2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.9) were developed to relate reflectance to chlo rophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratios within intact leaves. Leaves ex posed to frosts had lower chlorophyll contents and more variable a/b ratios than protected leaves. In frost affected leaves, chlorophyll content was highest near leaf centers and decreased toward leaf tips and edges. Decline in chlorophyll content was associated with shifts in chlorophyll a/b ratios and increases in red pigmentation due to anthocyanin, with effects being greater on leaf sides exposed directly to the sun. These altered patterns in pigmentation were consistent with patterns in freezing. Our results show the spatial scale of leaf response to freezing, and raise important questions about impacts of freezing on photosynthetic function in overwintering ev ergreens. NIELSEN, K. J. Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331, USA. Do bottom-up factors drive variation in herbivore effects? A study of up welling and herbivory along the central Chilean coast. Variation in upwelling regimes is known to affect community structure in rocky intertidal systems by altering the interactions between major preda tors and their sessile invertebrate prey. However, very little is known about the link between upwelled nutrient supply and benthic plant-herbivore in teractions. I used field experiments to test the hypothesis that macroalgae at sites with stronger and more frequent upwelling events would grow faster and therefore be less impacted by herbivory than algae at other sites. Using satellite images of sea surface temperature and in situ measurements of water temperature, I identified 2 'strong upwelling' and 2 'weak-upwelling' sites along the central coast of Chile. I compared algal growth and herbi vore impact among these four sites with three complementary studies. I monitored the growth rates of marked, herbivore-free individuals of two dominant plants, Mazzaella laminarioides and Lessonia nigrescens, in the mid and low zones, respectively. In the low zone I also examined the relationship between the alga Lessonia and the herbivorous snail Scurria scurra which lives obligately on the stipes of Lessonia by measuring the growth rates of marked pairs. In the mid zone I followed the recruitment and growth of macroalgae in cleared experimental plots (with herbivores, without herbivores, and manipulation controls) over one year. Herbivore potential in the mid zone at each site was calculated by seasonal surveys of herbivore abundance. Herbivore effects appeared to be strongest at the weak-upwelling sites but differences in herbivore pressure were also neg atively correlated with upwelling strength. Where herbivores were abun dant, they had a strong negative effect on macroalgal abundance and di versity. Strong upwelling sites had greater diversity of seaweed species recruiting to bare rock and the highest macroalgal growth rates. The evi dence from this study suggests that bottom-up effects associated with up welling regimes may contribute to variation in plant-herbivore interactions among sites but other sources of variation such as local abiotic conditions, recruitment patterns and historical contingency may also be important. 168 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="130">NORRIS, M.

In recent decades, a substantial amount of tallgrass prairie has been lost to the establishment of forests dominated by eastern redcedar (Juniperus vir giniana). With this shift in dominant plant life form, we expected accom panying changes in standing stocks of biomass, NPP, and biogeochemical cycles. The goals of this project were to determine and compare plant productivity, and major pools and fluxes of nitrogen in closed-canopy forest and adjacent prairie. Estimated NPP in the forest was 1.5 times that of the prairie. Additionally, there was a large shift from belowground biomass and productivity in prairie to aboveground in the forest. In forest sites, aboveground biomass was 148600 kg/ha, average litterfall was 500 g/m2/ yr, and standing stock of litter was 32 kg/M2. These values represent a considerable increase in aboveground biomass accumulation and surface litter inputs compared to tallgrass prairie. In a reciprocal transplant decom position study, we found no significant effects of habitat on decay rates of leaf or root litter after the first year. However, decomposing grass root litter exhibited patterns of N loss whereas redcedar roots accumulated N. This difference may help explain differences in soil N dynamics. Although there were few differences between forest and prairie soil N pools and fluxes, forest sites had significantly lower mineralization rates in May. This dif ference in the early growing season resulted in lower cumulative N min eralized annually in forest (14.3 mg/g/yr) compared to prairie to (18.1 mg/ g/yr). These basic shifts in ecosystem patterns and processes may alter regional biogeochemistry and carbon storage in eastern Kansas. NORTON, A. P. and G. ENGLISH-LOEB.

Antagonistic interactions between predaceous organisms can have profound effects on lower trophic levels. When predaceous taxa prey upon or com pete with one another their prey may experience lower predation pressure and thus reach higher densities in the presence of both predators than in the presence of only one species. We have been investigating the role of acarodomatia (small tufts of hair on the underside of leaves that are asso ciated with higher densities of several taxa of beneficial mites) in mediating interactions between beneficial mites and their host plants. Using a factorial design, we manipulated access to domatia and the presence of two species of beneficial mite on the wild grape Vitis riparia. Both mite species (the mycophagous Orthotydeus lambi and predaceous Amblyseius andersoni) utilize the domatia of wild grape. In the absence of domatia there was strong evidence for a negative interaction between these two mites: Both species were at lower densities when in the presence of the other mite than when alone. In contrast, when provided with access to domatia there was no evidence for an adverse effect of these mite species on each other. Thus host plant traits may reduce antagonistic interactions between beneficial taxa, thereby enhancing the overall level of predation on plant parasites. O'MALLEY, R. E.

Many papers address the restoration of agricultural lands to natural habitat (old field). Numerous others treat restoration of filled or urbanized wetlands to quasi-natural systems. Surprisingly little formal research has treated the subject of rice wetland restoration, however, and even less has discussed partial restoration of productive ricelands to increase their habitat value for transient wildlife. This research examines 1) organically managed rice wet lands and 2) ricelands in which the natural hydrologic regime has been partially restored, in order to detect effects of these strategies on habitat value for transient wildlife. Comparisons throughout the summer growing season of invertebrate communities in conventionally managed ricefields with those in restoration treatments were used to detect temporal trends in habitat value associated with each strategy. Although hydrologic restoration has been adopted on a much larger scale, invertebrate community patterns in organic ricelands show greater promise for supporting transient wildlife. As demonstrated through conventional MANOVA and path analysis of the invertebrate communities, increased vegetation diversity and the elimina tion of synthetic insecticides in organic fields interact to support a more abundant, and more complex food web than does rice grown using a semi restored hydrologic management cycle. Both strategies have significant positive effects on both abundance and complexity of invertebrates over controls. Because organic management incurs a yield drop, the net effect of the hydrologic restoration may be greater for wildlife due to its wider adoption. O'BRIEN, J. J. and S. F OBERBAUER.

Understanding the effects of climate on the physiology of tropical rainforest trees is crucial to predicting the future carbon balance of these highly pro ductive forests. In order to model tree ecophysiological responses and to measure their variability within and among species, we measured micro meteorological variables and tree transpiration rates in a Costa Rican old growth tropical rainforest. We estimated whole tree water use with xylem radial flow meters (Granier sensors) installed in 16 mature canopy trees and recorded sap flow over several months in 1999. The trees were between 50 to 70 cm in diameter and were approximately 20 to 30 meters tall. Simultaneous micrometeorological measurements were made at a weather station installed on a 30 meter high antenna nearby in the forest. We con densed the meteorological data using a principle components analysis, which had the added benefit of eliminating multicolinearity among the weather variables. The first four factors explained 42.6%, 14.8%, 11.5% and 10.1% of the variance respectively, for a total of 79%. The first factor loaded heavily on insolation, air temperature and wind speed. The second factor was most influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture, the third by rainfall and the fourth by wind direction. We used the four sets of factor scores as explanatory variables in a linear multiple regression of xylem sap flow rates. The first factor was most important in predicting sap flow in all cases, usually explaining 80 to 90 percent of the variance, except in one species where it explained only 50 to 60 percent. Regression coefficients varied more within individuals of a species than among species. This might be explained by idiosyncratic effects such as tree health, liana load or local site conditions. We plan to build a predictive model of tree responses to climate with the results of our regression analysis. OBERBAUER, S. F.,' H. W. LOESCHER,2 D. B. CLARK3 and D. A.

Net carbon exchange from a tropical wet forest. Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CO2 were conducted in tropical lowland wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. The system was based on a closed-path infrared gas analyzer and sonic ane mometer mounted on a 42 m tower. Prevailing winds at the site are easterly from the Caribbean with little anthropogenic influence. The tower footprint is primary upland forest. We estimated the annual net ecosystem exchange for 1999 based on EC and relationships between respiration and uptake rates. E.C. data were filtered for U* 0.15 m s-' and no rain events, so estimates are likely conservative for both uptake and respiration. Ecosys tem-level respiration was found to have a Q&lt;SUB 10&lt;/SUB = 5.1. During 1999, we estimated the forest was a sink for carbon, 1.8 t C ha-' y-'. The pattern of carbon uptake was strongly seasonal. Approximately 66% of the carbon was sequestered during the dry season. The results suggest that contrasting climatic factors control net carbon exchange during wet and dry seasons. OBRIST, D. and J. A. ARNONE. Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV 89512 USA. The responses of fine roots on patches of water and ni trogen in two dominant Mojave Desert shrubs. The ability of fine roots to proliferate into favorable patches of water and water-plus-nitrogen was studied in two dominant shrub species in the Mo jave Desert-Larrea tridentata (Creosote bush) and Ephedra nevadensis (Mormon tea bush). This potential root response could represent the ability of plants to take advantage of additional availability of water and nitrogen Oral Presentation Abstracts 169</page><page sequence="131">caused by increased spring and early-summer precipitation expected under global warming and by additional nitrogen deposition by metropolitan areas in southern Nevada and California. In a field study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) adult shrubs of Larrea and Ephedra respond to patches of additional water and water-plus-nitrogen by increased fine root proliferation into the patches; 2) patches with water-plus-nitrogen result in a stronger fine root response than patches of water alone since the Mojave Desert is both water and nitrogen limited; and 3.) fine root proliferation into patches depends on season and will be more pronounced after rainfall events, or in pre-watered plots, when plants are in a more active physiological state. We reject all three hypothesis since no detectable increase in fine root density was detected in patches of water and water-plus-nitrogen compared to unwatered and unfertilized control patches. Surprisingly, higher water availability in pre-watered plots lead to decreased root densities in Larrea instead of an expected root growth due to favorable conditions, whereas Ephedradid not show significant changes. Thus, our current data showing a lack of fine root proliferation into patches of water and water-plus-nitro gen suggest that capturing short-term localized resource patches may not be an important strategy for these plants-at least not in upper soil horizons (0-30 cm) in dry years.

Physiological responses of the de sert shrub Larrea tridentata to short-term variation in summer rainfall. In the semiarid region of southern New Mexico, plant activity is tightly coupled to water availability. Thus, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to potential shifts in the variability of seasonal rainfall. To develop a better predictive understanding of this vulnerability, we examined the effects of short-term variation in summer rainfall on growth and diurnal patterns of gas -exchange in the evergreen shrub, Larrea tridentata. During June-Aug. 1998, leaf area (LA) production, transpiration (E), and photosynthesis (A) were monitored for two groups of 8 shrubs; one group was irrigated twice during the summer. Soil moisture probes (TDR) were installed under each shrub (0-10, 0-30, 30-60 cm depths) and 4 shrubs per group were instru mented with automated sap-flow sensors. The first irrigation (30 mm; July 2) followed an extended dry period and, in turn, was followed by a series of rains (34 mm; July 2-5). Irrigation did not significantly affect shrub growth and physiology, and neither treatment group showed an immediate Ed (daily transpiration) response to increased soil moisture. All shrubs were characterized by substantial LA production (- 13%/d) from July 4 to 9, which may have masked their physiological responses. However, Ed and Ad (daily carbon gain) gradually increased in all shrubs during the sub sequent 10-d dry period. In contrast to the first irrigation, a second irri gation (40 mm; July 26), which followed a series of rains (114 mm total), had a significant impact on LA production (p = 0.04). Moreover, for sev eral days after the event, irrigated shrubs exhibited greater Ed and Ad than controls (e.g., Ed&lt;max= 938 vs. 750 mol m-2d-1; Admax= 662 vs. 518 mmol m-2d-'). These data support preliminary modeling results of a strong interaction between mean daytime vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture (i.e., the correlation between Ed and VPD decreases as the cor relation between Ed and soil water content increases). Both our field and modeling observations illustrate the importance of the timing of rainfall to Larrea growth and physiology. OJIMA, D. S.,' W. J. PARTON,' T. G. F KITTEL, 12 R. KELLY1 and M.

Simulated climate change impacts on key ecosystem properties of potential compared to current land cover for the conterminous United States. The VEMAP group has produced a set of transient climate data for the conterminous United States extending from 1895 through 2100. The cli mate data available past 1993 is derived from the two general circulation models used in the recent National Assessment of Climate Change Impacts. These models are from the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC) and the Hadley Climate Center (HAD). Using the Century ecosystem model with these climate files we simulated changes in net primary production, soil carbon, change in net total system carbon storage, evapotranspiration, and runoff with potential and current land use under a transient elevated CO2 concen tration. The focus of this paper is on the comparative response of agricul tural systems, range and croplands, to changes in the transient climate and carbon dioxide trends during the recent decades and into the future. Anal ysis of plant production, soil carbon, and net system carbon balance indi cated that agricultural systems are near neutral to slight sinks for carbon during the last two decades using current land use techniques. Climate change effects due to the 3 to 5 degree centigrade increase during the first 30 years of the GCM scenarios for the central US indicate that reductions in soil carbon occurs, however the inclusion of CO2 trends tend to offset the decline in system level carbon. The incorporation of better residue management and other adaptive land use management, suggest that higher levels of carbon sequestration is possible in the future. OLANDER, L. P. and P. M. VITOUSEK. Stanford University, Stanford CA 94305-5020. Can liquid chloroform be used for microbial biomass N and P assays? One accepted method for determining microbial biomass N and P is the chloroform fumigation-extraction technique. In this method moist soils are fumigated with chloroform vapor, which lyses microbial cells and releases their internal N and P. An alternative method used in the past was to add liquid chloroform directly to a soil suspension and shake it. The advantages of this technique are that it requires less time and it can easily be used with time staggered samples. However, chloroform can dissolve organic matter raising concerns that the non-living organic N and P could be sol ubilized along with microbial. Previous studies of the fumigation method suggested some release of C, but little release of N and P. We tested the chloroform fumigation and liquid methods in a series of Hawaiian soils that vary greatly in mineralogy, organic matter content, and how that or ganic matter is held. We generated a chloroform response curve by increas ing concentrations of chloroform added to soil suspensions and then com pared the results to that of the typical fumigation method for each soil type. The amount of N and P released from soils with increasing concentrations of liquid chloroform quickly reached saturation at 0.2 ml chloroform in a 30ml:1gDWE soil suspension, at a level very similar to that observed in the typical fumigation method. These results suggest that liquid chloroform techniques release no more N and P from non-living organic matter than do fumigation techniques. OLINE, D. K. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA. Distri bution and diversity of soil Crenarchaeota in the front range of the Rocky Mountains. Microbial communities exist at much smaller spatial scales than those of the macrobial plant and animal communities upon which most of our eco logical theory is based. Biogeographical and landscape patterns of micro bial distribution are ignored under the adage of "everything is everywhere, and the environment selects". Studies of microbial distribution typcially fall into two categories: 1) those at very small scales, such as different depths in a microbial mat, or 2) comparison of a small number of samples from widely scattered environments, such as different oceans. My study addressed how specific microbial communities change across environmen tal gradients at scales ranging from 10cm to 22km by using a nested sys tematic sampling design. I established transects of 10cm, Im, 10m, 100m, and lkm at each of four sites representing the major plant community types (foothills forest, montane forest, subalpine forest, and alpine tundra) along an elevational gradient in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. From soil cores taken along these transects, I took a number of physical and chemical soil measurements in addition to extracting the total community DNA from the soil. I used PCR primers specific for subgroups of the terrestrial crenarchaeota, a newly identified group of Archaea with un known metabolism, to amplify 16S rDNA sequences and denaturing gra dient electrophoresis to separate the mixed community DNA into individual bands which can then be sequenced. Geostatistical analyses of soil pH, water content, and organic matter content reveal similar patterns of spatial autocorrelation with a range of a few meters; in contrast, soil biomass showed no significant autocorrelation at any scale. Preliminary data showed that there are groups of closely related sequences which are both wide spread and abundant in lower elevation forest and tundra, and whose closest relatives have been identified in agricultural soil in Wisconsin. However, the subalpine forest site was dominated by members of a distinct and deep ly branching clade previously identified from boreal forest soil in Finland. 170 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="132">This is surprising, as the subalpine forest is in the midst of the elevational gradient and not at either extreme, yet there was a high degree of com munity turnover between it and neighboring sites.

Ef fects of summer grazing by reindeer on composition of vegetation, pro ductivity and nitrogen cycling. We investigated the effect of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing on veg etation structure, primary production and nutrient cycling of tundra heath vegetation in northern Norway. Fences, erected 30 years ago, allowed us to compare winter grazed, lightly summer grazed and heavily summer grazed vegetation at four different sites. At two sites, graminoids dominated the heavily grazed zone completely, while ericoid dwarf shrubs had almost disappeared. In the other two areas, the increase of graminoids was almost significant. The vegetation was analysed with a point frequency method. We measured primary production and nitrogen cycling in one site. Primary production was measured by harvesting annual shoots of all plants. The primary production was highest in the heavily summer grazed zone and lowest in the lightly summer grazed zone. This is the first evidence that grazing may increase the productivity in the tundra. The increased produc tivity in the heavily grazed zone is probable caused by an increased soil nutrient cycling as initial NH4 and organic N content were significant higher and the lag time was significant shorter even if there was no significant difference either in gross or net mineralisation. These results were incon sistent with the view that the highest productivity is found at intermediate grazing pressure. These results rather support the hypothesis that intensive grazing can promote a transition of moss-rich heath tundra into productive, graminoid-dominated steppe-like tundra vegetation. Moreover the results suggest that intermittent intensive reindeer grazing can enhance productiv ity of summer pastures. OLSON, M. H.' and B. P YOUNG.2 'Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA 17604 U.S.A.; 2Cornell Biological Field Station, Bridgeport, NY 13030 U.S.A. Habitat partitioning in size-structured fish popula tions. Habitat partitioning is often observed among potential interspecific com petitors. For many organisms, however, size-dependent changes in foraging ability and predation risk force a convergence in habitat use among small individuals of different species. Consequently, two species may compete when small even if larger individuals partition habitats. Previous studies of co-occurring largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and smallmouth bass (M. dolomieui) have documented strong habitat partitioning among adults, with largemouth bass occupying vegetated habitats and smallmouth bass occupying rocky habitats. Visual observations of habitat use in three New York lakes indicated that juvenile bass exhibited the same pattern of partitioning as adults, despite the fact that both species fed on similar prey and were vulnerable to predation. To examine mechanisms underlying these patterns of habitat use, we conducted a pair of laboratory experiments. The first experiment compared habitat-specific foraging abilities of juvenile lar gemouth and smallmouth bass. The second experiment compared habitat specific predation risk. Results of the first experiment indicated that small mouth bass fed much more effectively in rocks than vegetation, whereas largemouth bass fed equally well in both habitats. In the second experiment, smallmouth bass were at similar risk to predation in the two types of hab itats. In contrast, largemouth bass were more vulnerable to predation in rocks than vegetation. These results suggest that habitat partitioning among juvenile bass is maintained by a combination of mechanisms. ORWIG, D. A., R. C. COBB, M. L. KIZLINSKI, S. J. CURRIE and D. R. FOSTER.

Selective elimination of dominant tree species by introduced forest pests may initiate dramatic changes in forest structure, composition, and ecosys tem function. To examine ecosystem response to stress and mortality on hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), by the introduced hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae, HWA) we investigated the timing, magnitude and duration of nitrogen cycling changes in 8 sites in southern New England that vary in the level of HWA infestation. We analyzed nitrogen with close-topped cores, in relation to microenvironmental changes in soil temperature and moisture and light (through hemispherical photographs) as stands deterio rated. Thinning canopies from heavy HWA damage resulted in increased light and decreased forest floor moisture content. Soil water content in the forest floor was strongly associated with percent open sky (R2 =0.79). In comparison with healthy forests, heavily infested sites tended to have high er net N mineralization rates, larger extractable NH4-N pools, and had net nitrification rates 25 times greater. Low and undamaged stands typically showed net immobilization of nitrate. Results indicate that introduced pests and selective tree decline can rapidly and dramatically alter ecosystem pro cesses even prior to the onset of extensive tree mortality. OSENBERG, C. W.,' S. J.

Density-depen dence in reef fish: A quantitative synthesis. Density-dependent processes play important roles in population dynamics and in determining the efficacy of management strategies. This is especially true in marine systems where recent interest in marine reserves has spawned new applications of population dynamic models. The strength of density-dependence in marine fishes, however, continues to engender con siderable debate. Some investigators argue that density-dependence plays a critical role, essentially homogenizing the variation introduced through variable larval supply, while others argue that larval supply drives patterns of local abundance with little subsequent modification by density-depen dent processes. We took two approaches to help resolve this issue using field results compiled through a literature search of papers published in 20 journals over the past 30 years. Data were subjected to meta-analytic tech niques to assess the effect of conspecific density on settlement, and post settlement survival, growth, and reproduction. Results demonstrated strong effects of density on settlement and survival. Data on growth and repro duction were too sparse for analysis, perhaps because they are considered less important in driving local dynamics in open systems. We also used a conceptual approach developed by Schmitt to estimate the simultaneous effects of limited larval supply, density-independent mortality, and density dependent mortality on local abundance. The available results revealed comparable effects of density-dependence and supply limitation. We could not, however, estimate the relative importance of density-dependence in most studies. Studies frequently lacked concurrent estimates of natural set tlement rates and density-dependence, or relied upon natural variation in settlement to assess the strength of density-dependence (and thus over looked any covariance between settlement and habitat quality).

Long-term induction, soil nutrient availability and plant genotype: Quaking aspen growth, foliar chemistry and effects on a generalist herbivore. Genetic and environmental variability and their interactions are known to influence phytochemical composition and, in turn, herbivore performance. Further development of our theories of plant insect interactions requires improvement in our understanding of the relative roles of genetic and en vironmental factors. We used a common garden study to partition the ef fects of plant genotype and two environmental factors (soil nutrient avail ability and artificial defoliation) on plant growth and foliar chemistry of quaking aspen. We grew saplings of four aspen genotypes under two con ditions of nutrient availability, and subsequently subjected these saplings to two levels of artificial foliar defoliation. In the year following defolia tion, plant growth was influenced most by the nutrient availability treat ment, however, plant genotype and artificial defoliation also played a role. Although all three experimental factors impacted plant growth, defoliation in the previous year did not affect phytochemistry in ways important for insect herbivores. The lack of a dramatic phytochemical response was sur prising given the severity of the defoliation treatment (nearly 100% of leaf area was removed). Although the phytochemical response to the defoliation treatment was weak, the saplings did show evidence of tolerance. Plant tolerance to herbivory varied greatly and was dependent on both plant genotype and soil fertility conditions, however, relationships among toler ance and plant chemistry were not evident.

Temporal dynamics of litter car bon and nutrients after hurricane disturbance in three tropical forests. While hurricane disturbances are known to cause large inputs of litter, transporting C and other nutrients to the forest floor and affecting seedling regeneration, little is known about the length of time these litter pulses affect forest ecosystems. We investigated these pulses in three tropical for ests in Puerto Rico after the passage of Hurricane Georges by character izing the initial litterfall and then harvesting litter from the forest floor monthly for one year. The three forest types (wet, moist, and palm-domi nated) received different amounts of damage, and initial post-hurricane litter mass on the forest floor ranged from 1.5-2.5 times greater than pre hurricane values. Green leaves deposited by the storm represented 5-26 % of the total input of mass but the N and P concentrations of these green leaves did not differ from brown leaf litter. Decay rates were exponential and were similar in the wet and moist forest, but slower in the palm dominated forest. Nevertheless, at all sites forest floor mass returned to pre-disturbance levels within one year. The hurricane-added N was quickly lost as litter began to decay; P was retained in leaves and wood for ap proximately two months. Despite long-term damage to forest structure after hurricanes, the physical and biogeochemical effects of fine litter inputs appear to be short-lived, and may contribute to the resilience of these Puerto Rican forests.

Carbon pulse-chase into soil biota: An in situ stable isotope approach. The link between biological diversity and ecosystem function remains poor ly understood. We hypothesised that biogeochemical cycling of fundamen tal elements such as carbon (C) would be altered by changes in soil bio diversity. The effects of changes in soil biodversity on C fluxes through the soil-plant system were measured in a typical upland pasture. A mobile Stable Isotope Delivery laboratory (SID) was used to supply a tracer 'pulse' in situ. Studies and experiments made in 1999 and 2000 involved isotopic labelling of upland vegetation and soil biota with 50% atom '3CO2 at at mospheric concentrations (approximately 350 ppm) using flow rates of up to 5 L min-1. Automated online sampling and analyses enabled the deter mination of plant CO2 assimilation, soil CO2 respiration and headspace 13/ '2CO2 ratios. Using this technique, '3C derived from pulse labelled swards was traced into soil biota, organic matter and individual molecules allowing quantification of 13C incorporation and turnover in selected C pools. Results from in situ investigations showed that 70-80% of photosynthate C was lost from the plant biomass within 24 hours of assimilation. This loss was followed into a cascade of trophic groups of soil biota enabling Collembola, Acari, Enchytraeid worms and earthworms to be separated into classes according to photosynthate C incorporation and turnover.

Cli matic and geomorphic controls on Holocene vegetational changes in the arctic foothills of Alaska. The distribution of tundra plant communities in the arctic foothills of north ern Alaska is strongly influenced by landform controls on soil properties and thaw depths. We analyzed pollen and lignin-derived phenolic com pounds in sediment cores from 2 lakes on contrasting geomorphic units to understand Holocene vegetational changes in relation to climatic and geo morphic variation. Red Green Lake (RG; 68?39'N, 149041 'W) represents recently deglaciated land surfaces (&lt;15,000 yr BP). Young geomorphic units are characterized by irregular topography, thin soils, deep thaw layers, and moist non-acidic tundra (MNT). Upper Capsule Lake (UC; 68?38'N, 149025 'W) represents landscapes that remained unglaciated during the late Quaternary (&gt;500,000 yr BP). Old surfaces currently have little relief, thick organic soils, thin thaw layers, and moist acidic tundra (MAT). Quan titative analyses of the UC pollen record indicate a shift from MNT to MAT at 7000 yr BP in response to regional climatic cooling. Cinnamyl: vanillyl (C:V) ratios increase throughout the UC record, suggesting that non-woody tissue increased at the expense of woody tissue. Woody shrubs, e.g., Betula and Salix, may have decreased in abundance during this period. The RG pollen record also suggests a vegetational shift at 7000 yr BP, with sparse, xeric tundra changing to MNT. C:V ratios for RG increase from 8000 to 3000 yr BP, corresponding to a decrease in Betula pollen percent ages. After 3000 yr BP, lower C:V and higher syringyl values suggest more terrestrial organic matter and possibly more woody tissue. Higher percent ages of Artemisia and Selaginella rupestris also indicate that the vegetation near RG changed in response to climatic cooling at 3000 yr BP. Comparison of the UC and RG records illustrates the landscape level heterogeneity of vegetation during the Holocene, and improves our understanding of the controls on past tundra communities in the arctic foothills.

Exotic plant invasions in southern Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Utah. We evaluated the vulnerability of various habitats to invasion by exotic plant species in a 100,000 ha area in the southeast corner of Grand Stair case-Escalante National Monument, Utah. For the 97 0.1-ha plots in 11 vegetation types, exotic species richness (loglO) was strongly negatively correlated to the cover of cryptobiotic soil crusts (r=-0.47, P&lt; 0.001), and positively correlated to native species richness (r=0.22, P&lt;0.03), native species cover (r=0.23, P &lt;0.05), and total nitrogen in the soil (r=0.40, P&lt;0.001). Exotic species cover was strongly positively correlated to exotic species richness (r=0.68, P&lt;0.001). Only 6 of 97 plots did not contain at least one exotic species. Exotic species richness was particularly high in locally rare, mesic vegetation types and nitrogen rich soils. Dry, upland plots (n=51) had less than half of the exotic species richness and cover compared to plots (n=45) in washes and lowland depressions that collect water intermittently. Plots dominated by trees had significantly greater na tive and exotic species richness compared to plots dominated by shrubs. For the 97 plots combined, 33% of the variance in exotic species richness could be explained by a positive relationship with total plant cover, and negative relationships with the cover of cryptobiotic crusts and bare ground. There are several reasons for concern: 1.) Exotic plant species are invading hot spots of native plant diversity and rare/unique habitats; 2.) The foliar cover of exotic species was greatest in habitats that had been invaded by several exotic species; 3.) Continued disturbance of fragile cryptobiotic crusts by livestock, people, and vehicles may facilitate the further invasion of exotic plant species. PARISIEN, M. and L. SIROIS. Universite du Quebec a Rimouski, Ri mouski, Quebec, Canada. Dynamics and distribution of tree species across a fire frequency gradient in the James Bay sector of Quebec. It is well known that fire frequency is largely responsible for the distri bution of tree species in boreal ecosystems. Indeed, forest structure and composition differ greatly under different fire regimes; furthermore, as a fire regime changes in space or in time, the vegetation will shift accord ingly. This study's aim is to document the distribution and dynamics of tree species across a gradient of fire frequencies in the James Bay sector of Quebec. This territory of more than 400 000 sq km encompasses the northern boreal forest from the James Bay coast to longitude 68?W. Our central hypothesis is that changes in vegetation are mainly associated with changes in the fire regimes. First, the longitudinal distribution of trees was described across the gradient. Vegetation sampling was carried out in twen ty-three stations, distributed as a function of forest heterogeneity, extending from the James Bay coast to 115 km hinterland. Almost pure white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) stands form a narrow strip along the coast, where fire occurrence is most probably the lowest. At 0.2 to 4 km from the coast, white spruce is gradually replaced by black spruce (Picea mar iana (Miller) BSP). Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lambert), a species highly dependent of fire for its propagation, first appears at approximately 20 km west of the bay. Hinterland, with a fire rotation period estimated at 109 years, this species is extremely prolific, but it is totally excluded from the coastal region. With spatio-temporal data of all fires of 14 ha and over from 1930 to 1999, the role of fire will be quantified with GIS technology and 172 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="134">used to document tree species distribution and dynamics under different fire regimes. In the James Bay sector, jack pine seems to be very highly correlated with a high fire frequency. As for white and black spruce how ever, this relationship does not seem to be as straightforward: other factors might prevail in determining species presence-absence. In northern forests, tree species are at their ecological limits, therefore, where they are likely the most change-sensitive. The results of this study should increase our knowledge of how northern forests respond to changing fire regimes and exemplify the importance of maintaining many natural fire regimes to con serve diversity at a very large spatial scale.

Seston food quality and zooplankton dynamics in Lake Berryessa, a large reservoir in California. We have examined the impacts of food quality on zooplankton dynamics and biomass transfer. Food quality was measured as the essential fatty acid and phosphorus concentration in seston. Changes of the pelagic planktonic food web components in Lake Berryessa were monitored accordingly. Dur ing the study period, the particulate carbon concentration was near or above the reported incipient carbon concentration while considerable variability in seston food quality occurred due to dramatic changes in the sestonic composition. The total macrozooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios and Daphnia pulex biomass were both high during the springtime, while microbial food web components and the non-Daphnia macrozooplankton fraction were low at that time. The seston essential fatty acid content was strongly correlated with macrozooplankton dynamics and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratios. Laboratory growth experiments also con firmed that seston food quality largely determined carbon assimilation and growth of Daphnia pulex. Considering both field data and growth experi ments, we conclude that seston food quality monitored as essential fatty acid and phosphorus content was a good predictor for zooplankton dynam ics and biomass transfer in springtime while factors other than food quality may have affected Daphnia pulex and zooplankton dynamics during the other seasons in Lake Berryessa.

This program is tasked with publishing waterbody-specific technical guid ance manuals for numeric nutrient criteria development in lakes and res ervoirs, rivers and streams, estuaries and coastal waters, and wetlands. The program will also develop default criteria for the fourteen delineated nu trient ecoregions of the US. Technical guidance manuals for lakes and reservoirs, and rivers and streams will be finalized in February and March 2000. Expert workgroups have been formed to draft the coastal and estu aries, and the wetlands technical guidance manuals. Waterbody-specific de fault criteria ranges developed by the National Nutrient Team will be pub lished in Fall 2000 for lakes and reservoirs, and rivers and streams in eight nutrient ecoregions, and for wetlands in one nutrient ecoregion. The default criteria ranges will be developed using national, State, and Tribal datasets. Seed data for analyses include EPA STORET (STORage and RETrieval) water quality data; USGS NAWQA (NAtional Water Quality Assessment program), HBN (Hydrologic Benchmark Network), and NASQAN (NA tional Stream Quality Accounting Network). The 17 criteria documents will be published as appendices to the technical guidance manuals and will be available for public comment in Fall 2000. PARSONS, A., ' J. BARRETT,2 R. VIRGINIA2 and D.

The Dry Valleys of Antarctica are one of the most extreme desert environ ments on earth. The sources of legacy organic matter in Dry Valley soils have been characterized recently, but the contribution of carbon from con temporary soil biological activity has been less studied, and little is known about the current rates of carbon cycling. We are investigating the biolog ical, physical and chemical processes that contribute to CO2 flux in dry valley soils. We established field plots in Lake Fryxell and Lake Hoare basins in Taylor Valley, (site of the McMurdo Long-term Ecological Re search project) and took repeated measurements of soil CO2 flux with a LiCor 6400 infra red gas analyzer modified to measure small rates of CO2 flux. In a laboratory experiment we examined the role of temperature on flux rates by incubating soils in controlled conditions. In the field, maxi mum CO2 flux rates (-0.2 [imol m-2 s-') were low compared to all other ecosystems and negative fluxes were observed. Maximum positive flux in the field experiment was recorded at soil temperatures above 5?C. At the lowest soil temperatures (-2?C), both positive and negative fluxes were recorded. Presently, the laboratory results indicate that increasing solubility of CO2 in soil water may contribute to low or negative fluxes at low tem peratures. We present a conceptual model that examines the relationship between the biological and geochemical controls over CO2 flux in Antarctic soils. PAUL, A. J., W. A. NELSON, E. MCCAULEY and J. R.

Density-dependent interactions that occur among cohorts of juvenile fish can theoretically result in cycling populations and complex stock-recruit ment relations. Using fully-specified population models, it has been shown that these dynamics may occur for bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) pop ulations which spend several years rearing in small-unproductive streams. However, in developing a fully-specified model assumptions were made as to the underlying mechanisms which defined juvenile interactions. This raises two concerns when fitting the model to empirical data. First, is model fit evidence that inter-cohort interactions exist or merely an artefact of the necessary but unsupported assumptions required during model specifica tion? Secondly, direct estimates of model parameters using the data can suffer either bias or inflated variance if the incorrect functional relations were assumed. To address the problem of model mis-specification, we uti lized partially-specified models in which unknown mechanistic relations were represented by unknown functions. We analyzed a 15 year time series on densities of juvenile bull trout using this partially-specified model. The model was used to both test for inter-cohort interactions and estimate den sity-dependent mortality rates. Results using the partially-specified ap proach indicate that variability in the bull trout time-series was driven by juvenile mortality rather than adult fecundity. Furthermore, juvenile mor tality rates were dependent on total juvenile density and suggested that a linear function exist between the two variables. These conclusions support assumptions made in the fully-specified modeling approach; thereby, re inforcing the importance of inter-cohort interactions among juvenile fishes in populations with relatively long developmental time periods.

Spatial dispersion of migratory shorebirds at the continental scale: Implications for conservation. To date, most efforts to protect migratory shorebirds have been site-based, with emphasis on identification and protection of traditional migratory 'ho tspots.' While practical from a conservation standpoint, this classic ap proach under-represents species that are dispersed, or those that are dis tributed on the landscape in different ways during different years. Using 20 years of International Shorebird Survey data collected at 1000 wetlands in the conterminous United States, we quantified landscape-scale dispersion patterns for 30 species during fall and spring migration. Species differed in degree of dispersion, and in some cases, in their distribution on the landscape between spring and fall. Interspecific dispersion differences may arise from spatial constraints (habitat preference or specialization), or tem poral constraints (migration distance), since availability and number of sites differs with habitat type, and time available for migration varies with dis tance traveled. Overall, we identified several types of migration strategies that relate to conservation and management: a) Consistently highly aggre gated species, b) consistently dispersed species, and c) species that exhibit Oral Presentation Abstracts 173</page><page sequence="135">inconsistent dispersion patterns. Our results suggest that 1) broader man agement strategies are needed to effectively protect migratory shorebirds; 2) consideration of spatial dispersion may assist in setting broader conser vation goals; and 3) for hotspots that have already been identified, knowl edge of the landscape-scale dispersion patterns of species using that site could help managers to rank the importance of that site to many species, and to evaluate it within a continental context.

Here I present a model that indicates a predator-induced reduction in prey foraging rate can have a negative or positive effect on prey growth rate depending on resource dynamics. The positive effect occurs when the rel ative resource response to the prey foraging reduction is greater than the relative foraging reduction. I experimentally tested, using a simple aquatic food web, the model prediction that the predator-induced reduction in prey foraging can have a positive effect on prey growth rate. The model pre diction was confirmed; (caged) larval dragonfly, Anax longipes, induced reduction in small bullfrog tadpole, Rana catesbiana foraging had a posi tive effect on tadpole growth rate. The positive effect was absent at low, but large at high, resource (periphyton) productivity. This dependence on productivity was consistent with the model and thus supported the proposed mechanism. The mechanism that caused these results (e.g., the behavioral response of prey to increased predator density) is a widespread response observed across diverse taxa. This study thus suggests that predator-in duced reduction in prey foraging can positively affect prey in natural com munities. PECK, S. L. Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602 USA. The invasion of the solanaceous fruit fly on the island of Maui: An example of an invasion cascade. The presence of the solanaceous fruit fly (Bactrocera latifrons) in the Ha waiian Islands serves as a reservoir for introductions into subtropical areas of the U. S. mainland, therefore understanding its invasive abilities is im perative. The fly was first detected on Oahu in 1984 and has since been found on all of the major Hawaiian islands. Here, the question of whether the fly could have invaded the island without the prior invasion of two wild host plants Solanum sodomeum and Solanum torvum is examined using spatial stochastic simulation modeling. To parameterize the model and understand the population dynamics of the fly, two populations of B. latifrons were studied for six months using weekly protein bait and male lure trapping. In addition, fruit from the two species of invasive plants were gathered. Flies were then reared from the fruit in order to assess the infestation level. To examine the movement of the flies, individuals reared from wild host plants were marked with a vertebrate IgG protein and then released. Recaptured flies were assayed for the presence of the protein using ELISA. This method marks the fruit flies both internally and externally and has been found to be stable in the field for more than five weeks. Using this data, information on the movement and dispersal ability of the fly was quantified and used in the model. The model, written in the mathematical matrix language MatLab, suggests that the fly would have been unable to invade the islands if the prior invasion of the wild host plants had not reached the islands first. This study gives evidence of an "invasion cascade" where secondary invasions are predicated on prior invasions of other spe cies. PEEK, M. and I. FORSETH.

Patterns of resource acquisition and allocation represent major means of adaptation for plants. Allocation patterns have immediate impacts on fitness as well as impacts on future fitness and survival. A challenge facing ecol ogists is to determine how allocation patterns impact immediate fitness returns and the consequences for survival and long term fitness for peren nial plants. In cold deserts, plants are generally considered to be most limited by water. However, during the spring thaw and intermittent precip itation events when water availability is high, nitrogen has been shown to limit plant growth. Plants are able to exploit these nitrogen pulses by in creasing uptake kinetics or fine root production. In 1998 an experiment was conducted to determine the physiological and demographic response of the desert perennial, Cryptantha flava, to nitrogen pulses simulated from Mule deer excretions. Five treatments were applied to 1 to 3 year old, non reproductive plants. Treatments consisted of a control, deionized water, simulated urine application, feces application, and both a feces and urine application. Plants treated with the urine showed consistently higher pho tosynthetic rates across the season as well as increased leaf nitrogen con centrations. In the following year, mean size of urine treated plants in creased from 5.7 to 8.4 rosettes, whereas non-urine treated plants showed no significant increase in size. In addition to increasing in size, plants treated with simulated urine were more likely to initiate reproduction (X2&lt;00OOOl). Flowering response for urine treated individuals was 45% as compared to 15% for non-treated plants. Additionally, fruit production was also affected by urine application with 38% developing multiple ovules versus only 12% developing multiple ovules for non-urine treated plants. However, there was no difference in germination percentage between the two treatments, 57% and 50% for urine and no urine respectively. The positive growth and flowering response to these nutrient pulses resulted in changing size hierarchies in the population. In addition, since 5.6% of the population was found to naturally encounter an excretion, the positive ef fects of these stochastic nutrient pulses could be a mechanism maintaining genetic diversity within the population. PEINETTI, R. and M. COUGHENOUR. Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA. Long-term dynamics of riparian willow on the elk winter range of Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado). We analyzed changes in willow (Salix sp.) cover and relationships with probably causative factors. The study area comprised one valley of the elk winter range of Rocky Mountain National Park (Colorado). Low (LR) and high (HR) resolution digital maps of vegetation and hydrology were cre ated. Maps where incorporated into a spatial, process-based simulation model (SAVANNA) to estimate willow productivity. LR maps were gen erated by photo-interpretation and were used to conduct a change analysis, from historic (1946) to recent (1996) conditions. Riparian shrub cover and river features were digitized on-screen using a GIS. HR maps were created from a 1998 field survey of the valley to quantify heterogeneity within willow stands. Homogeneous vegetation patches were visually identified, and a GPS was used to delimit their boundaries. We classified patches based on willow density, percentage dead, and dominant morphotypes young (colonization), short (&gt;1.5 m), intermediate (1.5-2.0 m), and tall (&gt;2.0 m). A decrease in willow cover (21 ha or 21%) was determined using the LR maps. During this 50 year period, elk increased 8-fold and beaver declined to near disappearance. The beaver decline caused a reduc tion in river length (56%) and surface water area (69%). The upper valley, where less river changes were observed, was dominated by tall willow, while short and dead willows dominated areas of river reduction. Willow cover was heterogeneous, comprised of: colonization (12%), high density short (10%), intermediate (7%) and tall (27%) willow, high density dead willow (17%), and areas with low willow density (27%). A reduction of more than 50% in total willow aboveground productivity was estimated using 1946 and 1998 vegetation maps (132 and 63 ton). The percentage reduction in productivity largely surpassed the percentage willow cover reduction. Productivity was also decreased by degradation of cover-re ductions in density and increases in the proportion of short vs. tall willow. The willow decline was apparently caused by a number of factors, includ ing drier and warmer climate, increased elk herbivory, and possibly human activities. However, the beaver decline appeared to play the most significant role, as the total area of riparian habitats, where water table depths are sufficiently high for willow growth, was reduced.

Conceptual models of nitrogen cycling developed in the northern hemi sphere often emphasize nitrate as the dominant form of nitrogen in hydro logic losses from temperate forested watersheds. While several studies have challenged this notion, we lack a more comprehensive test of this idea across factors thought to control forest ecosystem development. We con 174 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="136">ducted a spatially extensive survey of nitrogen stream solute chemistry from 62 unpolluted, old-growth forested watersheds located across 8 sites in temperate southern Chile chosen to reflect differences in several con trolling factors of forest ecosystem development, including: 1) geologic substrate (volcanic ash vs. metamorphic vs. igneous rocks); 2) develop mental time (glaciated vs. unglaciated); 3) biodiversity (community com position, coniferous vs. broadleaved, evergreen vs. deciduous); and 4) hy drology (precipitation volume). Despite wide variations in ecosystem con trol factors, mean streamwater losses of nitrogen from these undisturbed sites consistently showed only exceedingly low levels of nitrate (0.00006 to 0.005 mg N per liter) and a strong dominance by dissolved organic forms of nitrogen (range 65%-97% of total dissolved nitrogen). Analysis of samples from individual watersheds indicated that losses of nitrate ex ceeded ammonium only at low dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels (&lt; 3 mg C per liter), and that relative losses of nitrate decreased at higher DOC. Our results indicate that geologic substrate, developmental time, bio diversity, and hydrologic regime are not key determinants of losses of inorganic nitrogen from unpolluted, old-growth temperate forests under nat ural, near-equilibrium conditions. We suggest that non-equilibrium respons es of forests to recent changes in nitrogen deposition and land-use distur bance from human activities may explain the apparent influence of eco system control factors on forest nitrate retention observed in other studies.

An historical analysis that presents the ecological consequences of devel opment can be a valuable educational tool for citizens, students, and en vironmental managers. In highly impacted areas, the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors can result in complex environmental conditions. His torical analysis is important because it allows us to separate some of these impacts on a time line and have a better understanding of how current ecological conditions arose. Historical analysis enables us to make the con nection between land use and environmental conditions, and to see the long-term consequence of development decisions. With an historical anal ysis, we can identify modification or loss of habitat, changes in water cir culation patterns, and qualitative changes in species composition, and get information on past pollutant inputs. Examples of some of these points will be given from an historical analysis we did of New Bedford Harbor, Mas sachusetts. An historical study can generate citizen and student interest in local environmental issues because it makes history come alive and pro motes an understanding of real events in their community. Citizens can use this information in a community-based environmental decision-making pro cess. Historical studies provide teachers with material to use in an inte grated curriculum, combining science, history, and writing, for middle and high schools. Such a cross discipline curriculum provides a context for students to see the relevance of science and history, and gives the oppor tunity for analysis and problem-solving in the classroom. Historical studies are also useful as background information for environmental managers and are useful in planning remediation projects. Historical studies can be pre sented in a variety of formats: slide shows, posters, written material, and web sites. The historical analysis we did of New Bedford Harbor, when presented as a slide show to citizens and teachers, attracted much interest. We are in the process of responding to that interest by putting the infor mation from the New Bedford study in a written monograph, in collabo ration with the New Bedford Whaling Museum, and on a web site to make it accessible to students and the general public.

Effects of species diversity and environmental variability on community and ecosystem properties in an aquatic microcosm experiment. Having shown that single species population dynamics were affected by temporal autocorrelation (none or positive) of environmental variability, we looked for effects on species coexistence and ecosystem function. Aquatic microbial microcosm communities initially contained 2, 4, 6, or 8 bacter ivore species (with 4 species compositions at each diversity level) and experienced constant, random, or correlated temperature treatments. We measured species presence/absence, species abundance and biomass, bac terial density, community respiration, and decomposition rate during the second and final week of the 6 week experiment. The proportion of initial species remaining at the end of the experiment was unaffected by environ mental variability, but proportionally more species were lost from diverse communities. This suggested that environmental variability did not affect species coexistence in this community, and that fewer than 8 species could coexist in this system. Total biomass increased with realized species di versity as expected by the sampling effect and/or species complementarity, but environmental variability had no effect on total biomass. Neither re alized diversity nor environmental variability affected community respira tion, and decomposition and bacterial abundance responded differently dur ing weeks 2 and 6. Other than the obvious increase in total biomass with diversity, the treatments have weak or no effects on static community prop erties. Dynamic community properties, measured by proportional changes in biomass, community respiration, and decomposition from week 2 to week 6 were also analyzed. Total biomass generally decreased during the period from week 2 to 6, more so in less diverse communities. Community respiration also decreased from week 2 to 6, but more so in diverse com munities. Decomposition decreased without any influence of diversity, but was significantly different in one autocorrelated temperature treatment. These results suggest that increased diversity reduced temporal changes in biomass, supporting hypotheses that predict stabilizing influences of diver sity on aggregate community properties. This result was, however, not con sistent among different community/ecosystem properties, and was not strongly affected by environmental variability. PETERS, D. P. C. USDA-ARS, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA. Plant species dominance and disturbance at a grass land-shrubland ecotone. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of presence and identity of dominant species on vegetation patterns at a shortgrass steppe - Chi huahuan desert ecotone. Species removals were conducted: (1) To identify new dominant species and assemblages after the current dominant is re moved, and (2) to determine if dominant species with different life history traits have different legacy effects on recovery of other species through time. This study was conducted at the Sevilleta LTER in central New Mex ico where communities may be dominated or codominated by one of two perennial grasses (blue grama, black grama) and one shrub (creosotebush). Within each community, all plants of the dominant species were removed from within 5 3m by 4m plots in 1995, and have been removed annually since that time. Five control plots were also located at each site. Cover and density by species have been estimated annually since 1995. Annuals dom inated all removal plots one year after removals were initiated. Subsequent recovery patterns depended upon the dominant species removed. Blue grama removal resulted in establishment and growth of perennial forbs whereas removal of black grama promoted recovery by perennial grasses. Removal of creosotebush in mixed communities with black grama resulted in recovery by perennial forbs, grasses, and shrubs whereas removal of this species in shrub-dominated communities resulted in little change in the vegetation. Legacy effects were most important in the first few years after removals were initiated. These results indicate that removal of dominant species by disturbances have dramatic effects on vegetation patterns that may alter the landscape mosaic at this arid-semiarid ecotone. PETERS, H. A. University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 3EA, United Kingdom. The influence of competition, diversity, and survival in the 50-hectare research plot at the Barro Colorado Island. The present study investigates the influence of competition and species diversity on tree mortality in the 50-ha long-term research plot at Barro Colorado Island (BCI). It has been hypothesized that interspecific interac tions that are stronger than intraspecific density-dependent effects might be sufficient to maintain the high species diversity observed in tropical forests. The level of competition and the neighbourhood diversity were calculated for all trees present in the 1982 census. Three distinct indices were used to quantify competition, and the Shannon index was used to quantify di versity. For all three measures of competition, individual trees consistently experienced more interspecific than intraspecific competition. On a per stem basis intraspecific competition was greater than interspecific competition, but the far greater number of interspecific competitors meant that the over Oral Presentation Abstracts 175</page><page sequence="137">all influence exerted by interspecific competitors was much larger than that of intraspecific competitors. If intraspecific competition does indeed have a greater influence on tree mortality, survival would be expected to be negatively correlated with diversity. The present study found a highly sig nificant negative correlation of survival with diversity at BCI. A recent analysis of the BCI plot found significant positive correlations between diversity and the life-history parameters recruitment and intrinsic rate of increase (r), but no significant relationships were found for survival.

Wind damage and revegetation across 10 years in a hemlock-white pine for est remnant: The importance of severity and pre-disturbance vegeta tion characteristics. The development of theory for forest disturbance and succession has given inadequate consideration to community and disturbance characteristics oth er than disturbance size. Here I present atypical findings on forest distur bance and regeneration, and suggest that disturbance severity, stand traits, and landscape setting explain much of the results. In July 1989 a tornado struck mature hemlock-white pine forest in northwest Connecticut, USA, damaging - 8 ha. I quantified canopy damage in 1991, sprouting and survival of canopy trees in 1995, and regeneration in 1991, 1995, and 1999. Canopy destruction was nearly complete (96% of trees). Only 8 of 87 pre disturbance trees &gt; 10 cm dbh survived through 1995. Only 10 of 144 trees had sprouted by 1995; none of these were the pre-disturbance dom inant conifers. Ten years after the disturbance, the vegetation was domi nated by Betula lenta and Prunus pensylvanica established from seed, and Tsuga canadensis that had been released from understory suppression. Spe cies diversity had increased. This disturbance led to greater mortality, less sprouting, more establishment from seed, and greater increase in species diversity, than is typical of large wind disturbances, probably due to the severity of the disturbance, the structure and composition of the stand, and the landscape setting. While simply considering disturbance size has mod est explanatory power, consideration of severity, stand traits, and propagule availability can greatly improve our understanding of wind disturbance.

Does aphid herbivory on Se necio multilobatus (Asteraceae) affect seed maturity and pollinator vis itation? Aphid herbivory has been associated with reduced seed weight and seed numbers in a variety of plant systems, but it is not known if aphid colo nization influences pollination success through insect visitation rates. We observed bee (Hymenoptera), fly (Diptera), and butterfly (Lepidoptera) vis itation rates on Senecio multilobatus (lobeleaf groundsel) where aphids (Aphididae) were naturally present or absent. We examined flower opening rates, pollinator visitation rates, seed number, and seed maturity on plants with and without stem-feeding aphids. Plants with aphids had a flower opening rate 20% lower than plants without aphids. We found that polli nators visited non-aphid plants more often than expected (X2 &gt; 3.8, p &lt; 0.05). Of total visitation time, 99% was spent on plants without aphids, which was significantly more than expected (X2 &gt; 3.8, p &lt; 0.05). The number and the percentage of mature seeds produced on aphid-colonized plants was 20% lower than on non-aphid plants. We found that plants with aphids had a lower percentage of flowers opening, fewer visits by polli nators and lower mature seed production. These results suggest that aphids may indirectly affect pollination by lowering the number of bee, fly and butterfly visits. PFISTER, C. A. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. Patterns of individ ual variation and its implications for population models. Comparisons of population models indicate that model choice is dependent upon the type of variability among individuals. Variation among individuals that is positively correlated through time, termed inertia, can greatly affect the outcome of population models. I have quantified the nature of vari ability in a variety of organisms in order to determine how common inertia terms are in natural populations. I review methodology for distinguishing inertia from size-based processes. Using demographic data for plants, in vertebrates, and fishes, I found significant growth inertia only in plants and some invertebrates. Other invertebrates, including a limpet and seastar spe cies, and intertidal fishes showed no significant growth inertia terms. These results suggest that although there are species for which some analytical models may be poor descriptors of future population structure, they may readily be identified from demographic data. PHILIPPI, T Savannah River Ecology Lab, Aiken, SC, USA. Size-based demography of long-lived organisms. The specific motivating question is how to project long-term forest dynam ics from short-term demographic data on individual saplings and trees, but the same question holds for tortoises and other long-lived, size-structured populations with appreciable variation among individuals in growth rates. Variation in size-specific growth rates is clearly important. Extrapolating from average size-specific growth rates is misleading: The fate of the av erage tree seedling or young tortoise is to die. A less obvious but crucial consideration is how individuals' deviations from the population mean size specific growth rates carry over across time intervals. Simple matrix models assume independence in deviations from one interval to the next. More complicated matrix models conditional on both size and growth in the previous time interval assume an exponential decay in deviations. "Bundle" models assume complete persistence in individuals' deviations. Most in dividual-based models (such as forest simulators) assume deviations to be completely specified by measured environmental factors (e.g., shade), and thus to persist based on the persistence of those environmental factors. Modem statistical approaches to such longitudinal data extract main effects of individuals and years, and attempt to explicitly model patterms in the covariances of the deviations. None of these approaches are correct, but they fail in different ways, and different biological situations are best ad dressed by different approaches. Attention to these assumptions may pro duce better projections, and can lead to novel insights into life-histories. PHILLIPS, R. L.,' S. C. WHALEN' and W. H.

Influence of atmospheric CO2 enrich ment on soil methane consumption in a coniferous forest. The rising concentration of atmospheric CO2 may impact soil ecosystem properties, such as microbial processes, which in turn may influence soil atmosphere exchange of radiatively and chemically important trace gases. Oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria in upland soils is the only identified biological sink for atmospheric CH4. Atmospheric CH4 consumption in upland soils is highly sensitive to changes in soil moisture and nutrient status, which are environmental variables expected to be influenced by elevated atmospheric CO,. Consequently, we studied atmospheric CH4 ox idation for 2 years in the field using the static chamber method at a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) site, where CO2 was continuously maintained at 200 ul 1-' above ambient in an aggrading pine forest. Net CH4 flux ranged from 0 to -2.6 mg m-2 d-l, indicating that these upland soils are sinks for atmospheric CH4. A mixed, repeated measures analysis of variance showed that elevated CO2 significantly decreased soil CH4 con sumption under conditions of low moisture and high temperature in per manently established field plots. A comparison of time-integrated annual fluxes for both years revealed significant differences for CH4 consumption between ambient and enriched CO2 plot, with enriched plots consuming an average of 41 mg CH4 m-2 less CH4 than controls each year. Results show that elevated atmospheric CO2 reduced average CH2 consumption in this pine forest by approximately 22% annually. If these results are represen tative, rising atmospheric CO2 will significantly decrease the sink strength of upland forest soils in the atmospheric CH4 budget. PHILLIPS, N.,' B. J.

Hydraulic capacitance and resistance as a function of tree size. Water stored in a tree's conducting system may compensate for the large hydraulic resistance to water flow in tall trees. If so, as trees grow larger, we would predict that an increasing percentage of daily water use is derived from stored water (capacitance). To test the hypothesis that larger trees rely 176 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="138">more on stored water than small trees, we measured capacitive water use as a percent of total daily water flux in 15 m and 60 m tall individuals of Douglas-fir in and near the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility. On clear, warm days with moderate soil moisture availability, water use derived from capacitance was 11 percent (1.7 kg) of total daily water use (15.8 kg) in 15 m trees, and 21 percent (89.7 kg) of total daily water use (426 kg) in a 60 m tree. These results are consistent with those found in tropical tree species, where stored water use ranged from 9 to 15% with increasing tree size. A simulation model of diel water uptake and loss from trees demonstrates that (1) the amount of water use derived from storage may differ substantially depending upon the location of capacitive stores along a resistance pathway (from 4 to 14% as a fixed capacitor is placed across 63 to 38% of the bole, respectively), and (2) that the same diurnal lag between water loss and uptake can result from different combinations of hydraulic resistance and capacitance. Since the same time lag is obtained if resistance and capacitance vary inversely, plants may have very different evolutionary adaptations that result in the same dynamical vascular behav ior. PIERCE JR., K. B. and D. URBAN. Duke University, Durham, NC 27708 USA. Separating dispersal and environmental effects in an eastern de ciduous forest. Species patterns are dictated by dispersal events and subsequently survival to reproduction. The purpose of this study was to separate species in a mixed deciduous forest into those limited mainly by dispersal and those limited by environmental factors. To do this, 99 5 by 5 m quadrats were randomly placed inside a 1 ha stem map. Seedlings were tallied in these quadrats and compared to local source trees. Four environmental variables were measured at each quadrat, azimuth, slope, topography and canopy cover. The method used to discern these differences was a new variation of the Mantel test. The Mantel test uses quadrat pair dissimilarities as the response variable. The species dissimilarities in our variation, the cross Mantel test, are between different life-history stages in different quadrats,ie. between seedlings and canopy trees. Since the Mantel test uses dissimilar ities, geographic distance between plots can be considered as a predictor variable. Therefore, life-history compositional dissimilarity was compared with simple spatial effects, environmental effects, and environmental ef fects after accounting for distance as a predictor variable. PCA of the en vironmental variables indicated canopy (PC 1, 0.9972, 52%) and trans formed aspect (PC 2, -0.9887, 43%) explained 95% of the environmental variation between quadrats. Twenty species were considered, 18 deciduous and 2 conifers. The Bonferroni adjusted p-value of 0.0025 was used. Four species showed spatial structure at this level, Quercus velutina, Lirioden dron tulipifera, Pinus strobus and Betula lenta. This suggest these species were most influenced by dispersal. Four species showed environmental structure due to canopy coverage, Quercus rubra, Nyssa sylvatica, Carpi nus caroliniensis and Robinia pseudoacacia. Aspect was only significantly associated with Quercus alba. This study was successful in assessing spe cies patterning agents. It also provides a new scale-independent technique for assessing multivariate effects on species patterns. PILATI, A. and W A. WURTSBAUGH. Utah State University, Logan UT 84322-5210 USA. Effects of zooplankton on the development of a deep chlorophyll layer and nutrient transport: A 15N limnocorral experi ment. Deep chlorophyll layers (DCL) are dominant features of many oligotrophic lakes and oceans and often contribute over 50% of water column primary production. A variety of competing physical, chemical, and biological hy potheses have been proposed to explain their formation. Here we describe an experiment that tested the importance of zooplankton grazing as a factor driving the development of the DCL. In oligotrophic Yellow Belly Lake (Sawtooth Mountains, central Idaho) we compared changes in the chloro phyll profiles, zooplankton-mediated nutrient transport, and eddy diffusiv ity in 6 limnocorrals (1-in diameter, 17-in deep). 15N ammonia and rho damine dye were added to the epilimnion or metalimnion of the corrals in a factorial design in the presence or absence of zooplankton. In the lim nocorrals with zooplankton, epilimnetic zooplankton biomass was 2X high er, and estimated grazing rates 3X higher, than in the metalimnion. After 11 days, chlorophyll levels in the zooplankton treatment declined 72% in the epilimnion, but only 53% in the metalimnion, leading to the develop ment of a DCL. In the no-zooplankton treatment the epilimnetic chlorophyll increased 11%, and the metalimnetic algal levels decreased 41%, resulting in the formation of an epilimnetic chlorophyll layer. Measurements of zoo plankton distribution in the lake and limnocorrals, and modeled grazing rates are consistent with the observed changes. Biologically-mediated movement of 15N from the epilimnion and metalimnion was downward, either into the metalimnion or hypolimnion. Eddy diffusivity was high in the limnocorrals therefore rhodamine, and presumably '5N, moved into ad joining strata, indicating the importance of this process. Grazing, however, coupled with a downward movement of nutrients ('5N) by fecal material and/or algal sedimentation, appears to explain the development of a me talimnetic chlorophyll maxima.

Understanding the interaction of crayfish and the Hine's Emerald Dragonfly larvae coexisting in crayfish bur rows. Biotic interactions, such as predation, can have significant influences on population dynamics, community structure, and the behaviors of organisms. Odonates are a group of organisms in which predation has been a major factor shaping the observed life histories and behaviors. While most studies have focused on the effect of vertebrate fish predators and intraguild pre dation, crayfish are another predator present in many aquatic systems that can have an effect on larval Odonate populations. Habitat duration can also influence larval Odonate communities by limiting the species that can maintain populations in variable environments. It can also effect the strength of biotic interactions between those organisms that persist. The Hine's Emerald Dragonfly, Somatochlora hineana, inhabits small, ephem eral streamlets that experience seasonal drying; a situation intolerable for many larval Odonates. Field studies indicate that larvae use active crayfish burrows to survive through periods of drought. Crayfish are predators of dragonfly larvae, which raises the question of how these organisms coexist in burrows. To resist predation, S. hineana larvae may simply be distasteful or crayfish may fail to recognize them as prey. Lab experiments were con ducted to establish whether a direct predator-prey relationship exists be tween S. hineana larvae and the crayfish, Cambarus diogenes. Results show that C. diogenes readily consume S. hineana and other dragonfly larvae, and are only limited by the size of the larvae relative to it's own size. To further investigate predation by crayfish inside burrows and whether larvae avoid active burrows, we conducted a field exclusion experiment manipu lating the presence of crayfish in burrows. Preliminary results of a repeated measures analysis shows no significant difference between treatments (p =0.87), indicating that the presence of crayfish has no effect on S. hineana larval densities within burrows. This suggests either that larvae may not be able to discriminate between burrows with crayfish present/absent, or that the cost may not be high, relative to the benefits attained by inhabiting the burrow. S. hineana larvae probably exhibit unique behaviors that allow them to avoid predation by crayfish within burrows. POLIVKA, K. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. Habitat selection pat terns based on enhanced and limited growth and survival of juvenile fishes in an estuarine nursery. River and stream habitats that merge with coastal marine environments offer a range of habitat choices for organisms. My research with freshwater fish indicates that estuaries can serve as high productivity nursery areas, with prey availability 2-3 times higher than those in upstream areas. Fish enjoyed high growth in the estuary, and two freshwater species (Cottus asper and C. aleuticus) grew at rates 2-3 times greater than those upstream. Different models of habitat selection predict the extent to which an animal incorporates habitats of different profitability and risk into its life history. Experimental tests of whether biotic interactions limited the rewards of selecting estuaries for C. aleuticus demonstrated that intraspecific compe tition reduced growth rates and survivorship only slightly but the presence of Leptocottus armatus, a marine relative, reduced survivorship of C. aleu ticus nearly four-fold. In laboratory experiments, C. aleuticus moved to patches of 2-3 times greater food density about 1.5 times as often as they moved to patches that had the same food density as the patch in which Oral Presentation Abstracts 177</page><page sequence="139">they were initially placed. These results indicate the ability of C. aleuticus to select the more profitable estuary on the basis of higher food availability relative to upstream habitats and that the extent to which this pattern of habitat selection maximizes fitness is limited, in part, by biotic interactions.

Patterns of aquatic ben thic invertebrate distribution in a series of lakes within a landscape continuum. Several important lake features have been shown to be related to a lake's position within a landscape. Here we report on a test of the hypothesis that benthic invertebrate community characteristics are related to lake-landscape position. Specifically we test how the relative position of a lake within a regional flow path influences invertebrate community characteristics. Two lake attributes that can influence invertebrate communities, chemical char acteristics and degree of isolation, change predictably with the relative position of a lake in a regional flow path. Understanding biotic patterns in terms of landscape position requires discriminating the effect of these two co-varying attributes. In this study, we examined the interacting effects of chemical attributes and degree of isolation on benthic invertebrate distri bution in lakes in northern Wisconsin by a sampling design that crosses high/ low ion concentrations with connected/ isolated lakes. We use this information to infer processes governing landscape-scale patterns of distri bution. We evaluated invertebrate community characteristics from 38 lakes in the Northern Highland District. Our comparisons of species number and abundance indicated that benthic invertebrates were non-randomly distrib uted among lakes within a landscape. Benthic invertebrate richness in creased with the degree of isolation and, to a lesser extent, ion concentra tion. Multiple regression analyses indicated that these patterns were sig nificant at a level of P=0.001 and P=0.060, respectively. The integrated effect of ion concentration and degree of isolation indicated that there were discernable differences between invertebrate communities in lakes within these categories, although preliminary results are not significant. These results suggest that subtle differences in the relative position of lakes within a lake district affect benthic invertebrate distribution. POLLOCK,. M. M.

Using the spatial and age structure of natural ponderosa pine forests as a model for restoration. Many ponderosa pine forests in the American Southwest are considered degraded and in need of restoring because land use activities such as fire suppression and cattle grazing have altered natural regeneration and suc cessional processes. Current restoration practices include removing most trees that have been established since humans of European descent colo nized the area. Such practices have raised concerns that these forests aren't being restored to a natural condition, but rather degraded yet further. Here we examine the fine-scale spatial distribution of tree ages and sizes in natural or minimally disturbed ponderosa pine stands in northern Arizona and New Mexico to better understand how old-growth forest structure is developed and maintained. The purpose is to provide a more accurate mod el from which to base restoration efforts. Our results suggest that ponderosa pine forests are uneven-aged over small areas (&lt; 1 ha), with the range of ages on the order of centuries. At finer scales (&lt; 0.01 ha) even-age patches occur, embedded within an uneven-aged matrix. Age distributions at all sites indicate that regeneration occurs episodically, with long periods (de cades) in between where little or no regeneration occurs. Some regeneration pulses among sites are synchronous, indicating that these may be influenced by large-scale climate patterns, while other regeneration pulses are asyn chronous and may be a result of local climatic variation. Almost all regen eration within the past 100 years has occurred in open patches where there is currently no overstory canopy, but there are also open patches where no regeneration has occurred. These fine-scale forest structure features suggest that the location of dominant tree patches within a stand slowly shift over time and that these forests may follow a "shifting mosaic" model of suc cession. These data also indicate that current "tree-by-tree" restoration ef forts which retain only those young trees close to the position of old trees that have died, do not restore the intricate spatial and age structure found in ponderosa pine forests. Restoration strategies that create a mosaic of small forest openings and small patches of trees of different age and size classes will more closely approximate natural conditions. PORAZINSKA, D.

We estab lished three sampling sites across an elevation gradient in Taylor Valley, during the 1993-1994 austral summer. We sampled each site at larger (10 x 10 m) and smaller (1 x 1 m) scales three times during six years (1993, 1995, and 1999). Nematode abundance, diversity, and soil moisture varied only with elevation, not spatial scale over the six years. Scottnema lind sayae was more abundant at the highest elevation and dominated all sites, while Eudorylaimus antarcticus was more abundant at the lowest elevation. Plectus antarcticus was present only at the lowest elevation and declined sharply in numbers during the study (as did soil moisture) suggesting it could be subject to local extinction. Soil moisture was greater at the lowest elevation. Year of sampling had a significant effect on the density and diversity of nematode species and on soil moisture. While Scottnema was negatively correlated with soil moisture, Eudorylaimus and Plectus showed a positive relationship. Narrow niche requirements and sensitivity to small changes in soil moisture characterize nematode species in the Dry Valley soil ecosystem. Interannual variation in Antarctic soil nematode commu nities suggests they respond to short-term climate variation and may be affected by climate change. PORTER, E. and B. HAWKINS. University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA 92612, USA. Biogeographical patterns of butterfly species richness. Studies on a variety of vertebrate taxa show that variation in species rich ness on continental scales correlates closely with contemporary climatic variables. Because the strongest correlates are generally measures of energy or productivity, previous researchers have concluded that energy availabil ity is a likely determinant of species richness at this scale. There were two main objectives in our study. First, we wished to know whether similar patterns hold for insects. Therefore, we identified relationships between climatic variables and species richness for butterflies as a representative insect group. Second, to assess the generality of these relationships, we compared the relationships between butterfly species richness and climatic variables across four continents: North America, Europe, Australia and Af rica (south of 20 degrees latitude).. We found that PET is the strongest correlate with species richness in North America and Europe and AET is the strongest correlate for Australia and Africa. Our results suggest that PET has a clear effect on butterfly species richness but only for values below approximately 700 mm/year. Where PET is higher than 700 mm/ year, AET is a better predictor of species richness. These results suggest that climatic variables, specifically measures of productivity and energy, are important determinants of species richness for butterflies, but different mechanisms operate in temperate versus tropical areas.

Food-chain length is an important characteristic of ecological communities that influences community structure, ecosystem function, and contaminant concentrations in top predators. In the 70 years since Charles Elton first noted that food-chain length was variable among natural systems, ecolo gists have considered numerous explanatory hypotheses, but few of those are supported by empirical evidence. Conventional wisdom, as expressed by major ecology textbooks, generally suggests that food-chain length is limited by resource availability or by the dynamic stability of food chain. However, recent work seriously challenges conventional wisdom. Here, I review recent advances in understanding the ecological determinants of food-chain length and place those results into the context of historically 178 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="140">important hypotheses. I discuss both empirical evidence for ecosystem size and productivity as determinants of food-chain length, and theoretical ev idence for the relationship between food-chain length and food web sta bility. I also discuss how the new empirical results challenge the widely cited Oksanen-Fretwell model for trophic interactions which assumes that productivity determines food-chain length. These recent studies highlight the need for further work on food-chain length and food web stability, and emphasize the need to tests of food-chain theory at the ecologically relevant scale of whole food webs.

Recent work suggests that patterns of parasitism in wildlife are changing due to anthropogenic alteration of habitats. In this study, I assess whether anthropogenic disturbance, in this case logging, alters patterns of parasitism and I further assess which processes might drive these changes. Through systematic censuses and experimental tests, I ask: 1) Are parasite preva lence and intensity in stream communities affected by clear-cut logging; 2) can changes in host density associated with logging explain altered parasite levels; 3) what aspects of parasite transmission are disrupted by logging induced disturbances? I focus this study on a trematode that obligately and sequentially infects Dicamptodon tenebrosus, Juga silicula, and Calineuria californica from small streams in the Cascade Mountains, OR. To deter mine the effects of logging on patterns of parasitism, I censused each host species for parasites from 11 creeks in heavily logged watersheds and 7 creeks in unlogged watersheds. I chose sampling sites based on watershed size, stream gradient, elevation, latitude, longitude, and severity of logging. Logging was associated with a significant decrease in mean parasite prev alence and intensity, and a decrease in the density of each host species. I then tested whether changes in host density associated with logging af fected parasite transmission success. Using a randomized block design, infected hosts were caged with uninfected hosts at three densities each to evaluate the effect of host density on the recruitment and reproduction of the parasite. Parasite recruitment was sensitive to changes in stonefly den sity, and parasite reproduction was sensitive to changes in salamander den sity. Neither recruitment nor reproduction of parasites was sensitive to changes in snail density. This study links anthropogenic disturbances di rectly with changes in parasitism and suggests that altered mechanisms of parasite transmission drive these changes. POTOSNAK, M. J. and K. L. GRIFFIN.

Velvet beans (Mucuna sp.) were grown from seed in four Conviron cham bers during two separate experiments to explore the effects of acclimation to elevated CO2 on basal rates of isoprene emission. In each experiment, plants were grown for 2 months under controlled conditions of light, tem perature, relative humidity and CO2, and then isoprene flux measurements at standard conditions and leaf biochemistry data were collected over four days. The first experiment manipulated CO2 (37/73 Pa) and relative hu midity (40/70 %) in a two by two factorial design. The velvet beans grown at 73 Pa CO, had significantly (-25%) lower emissions than the ambient CO2 plants, but the relative humidity treatment had no significant effect. In this experiment, isoprene emissions were well correlated to leaf nitrogen content (r2 = 0.80), raising the possibility that isoprene emissions were suppressed due to nutrient limitations caused by increased biomass. During the second experiment, again CO2 (37/73 Pa) was varied, but instead of relative humidity, daytime temperature (26/340 C) was chosen as the second factor. Unfortunately due to a chamber malfunction, the 37 Pa/24? C cham ber was lost, but a comparison of the two 340 C chambers again showed that elevated CO2 concentrations suppressed isoprene emissions. Nutrient limitation does not explain this result, since fertilization was increased and there was no correlation between nitrogen content and isoprene emissions. Two measures of leaf biochemistry provided additional insight. Rubisco activity was well correlated to isoprene emissions within the 73 Pa/24? C treatment, but there was no correlation for the 37 and 73 Pa/32? C treat ments. On the other hand, glucose content was well correlated to isoprene emissions for these two treatments, but not for the 73 Pa/24? C treatment. In addition to nitrogen content and glucose, sucrose, chlorophyll A, chlo rophyll B, total protein, and Vcmax and Jmax (from ACi curves) data were collected during at least one of the experiments, and no single correlate was found that could predict basal rates of emissions across the different treatments. PRATT, R. and R. BLACK. Washington State University, Pullman WA 99164. Xylem cavitation and repair in two clones of black cottonwood with different stomatal behavior. Xylem cavitation was studied in two genotypes of black cottonwood (Po pulus trichocarpa), one with stomatal control (SC) and one without sto matal control (NSC), however both genotypes exhibit similar resistance to cavitation. Plant material was cloned and grown in a greenhouse. Mea surements of in situ ultra sonic acoustic emissions (AE) and sap flux in dicated that both genotypes exhibited xylem cavitation just after midday coincident with peak sap flux. In the SC genotype specific hydraulic con ductivity (ks) at midday was 78% of ks measured at predawn (ksm.), com pared to 53% of ksmax for the NSC genotype at midday. The difference between predawn and midday k, in the NSC genotype suggests post-midday refilling of cavitation. The genotypes were well hydrated throughout the study: predawn (Tpd) and midday water potentials (Tmd) were -0.2 ? 0.1 and -0.5 + 0.2 MPa respectively, for the NSC genotype and -0.3 + 0.1 and -0.9 + 0.3 MPa, respectively for the SC genotype. Differences in stomatal control between these two genotypes may explain differences in midday declines in ks as internal water potentials (T) decline diurnally. PRICE, M. V. and R. A. CORRELL. University of California, Riverside, CA, U.S.A. Depletion of seed patches by Merriam's kangaroo rats: Are GUD assumptions met? Because the foraging behavior of granivores is often difficult to observe directly, it has become popular to study their foraging ecology indirectly by observing the extent to which experimental seed patches are depleted. An extension of the Marginal Value Theorem suggests that the density of seeds an optimal forager leaves behind (the Giving Up Density, or GUD) can provide a quantitative assay of its perception of fitness costs and ben efits associated with the patch, among other things. Interpreting GUDs as more than qualitative indications of overall foraging activity or patch pref erence rests, however, on a set of assumptions that have rarely been tested. We used direct observation of foraging kangaroo rats to test two assump tions: That the curve relating cumulative harvest to time spent within a patch (Gain Curve) is smoothly decelerating, and that animals leave seed patches when harvest rates have fallen to a threshold level. Gain curves were characterized in the laboratory for 6 experienced individual Dipodo mys merriami, using seed trays similar in size and design to ones used in many previous GUD studies. Polynomial regression indicated that all gain curves were linear until 60-80% of seeds had been harvested (ca. 200 sec of foraging time), and decelerated only thereafter. Animals searched more systematically than random expectation. In the field, single individuals de pleted seed trays in multiple visits and harvested less during each succes sive visit. Amounts removed during the first visit (66%; 1.98 g) were small er than maximum cheek pouch capacity and corresponded to depletion levels achieved in the laboratory during the linear portion of the gain curve. These results indicate that kangaroo rats deplete patches and use patch leaving rules that are not as simple as those assumed by the GUD model. This suggests caution in using the GUD approach before its assumptions are tested. PRICE, K. P,I F YU,I R. LEE, J.

This study has shown that Global Area Coverage (GAC) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites can be used to detect the onset of green-up for steppe ecosystems in Inner Mongolia. The study shows a strong linkage between onset of green-up and climatic factors. Since eco system stability of Inner Mongolian steppes is climatically controls, onset Oral Presentation Abstracts 179</page><page sequence="141">of green-up was used as an indicator of ecosystem stability. The coefficient of variation for the onset of green-up of the steppes/forest ecosystems was used as an Ecosystem Stability Index (ESI). The ESI showed meadow steppe/forest ecosystems to be most ecologically stable and the desert steppe to be the least stable. Large areas of typical steppe, near the desert steppe ecotone, exhibited similar ESI values to those of the desert steppe suggesting greater ecosystem instability in these typical steppe areas. This suggests that large expanses of typical steppe in this region are undergoing ecosystem degradation resulting in lower productivity and changes in land use practices. PRICE, J. University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. Dispersal, speciation, and the fate of founders: The Hawaiian biota as a model for linking phylogenetic processes with large-scale diversity patterns. Due to its isolation and limited age, the biota of the Hawaiian Islands can be subdivided into groups of species derived from distinct founder events from the outside. These assumed lineages are treated as clades which evolved under similar spatial and temporal constraints. Detailed species range data for the entire flora and select groups within the fauna reveal an inverse relationship between the number of species in a lineage and the average range size of the species in that lineage. The resulting distribution acts as a conceptual model which may elucidate mechanisms that drive beta diversity at large scales. Since most Hawaiian species have narrow ranges while a few widespread species make up the bulk of the individuals in this system, Hawaii appears to follow the cannonical distribution of abundance. Rare species are generally members of large lineages, while most common species belong to small lineages; this suggests that differing speciation tendencies of clades may underlie cannonical abundances in Ha waii. The Hawaiian biota is shaped by in situ speciation rather than an equilibrium of immigration and extinction; as this is also the case for con tinental biotas, this model may be applicable at larger spatial scales.

Winners never cheat; cheaters never win: Species' flexibility and the symmetry of benefit within a mutualism of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plants. Mutualisms are constantly exposed to non-mutualistic "cheaters", or para sites. In tightly coevolved mutualisms, for example the mutualism between figs and fig wasps, species of fig wasp are either parasites or mutualists. In diffuse mutualisms, in which multiple partners interact, species may be more flexible and act as mutualists of one associate but parasites of another. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inhabit the roots of plants and provide phosphorus to plants in exchange for photosynthetically derived carbon. The relationship is a classic, and diffuse, mutualism. We have used a variety of species isolated from an old field community to explore interactions between pairs of plants and AME We ask 1) are species of plant and fungus strict mutualists or parasites? and 2) are there constraints to parasitism? We have found that species are not strictly mutualists or parasites, rather, pre dicting the net costs and benefits of a particular association requires a knowledge of the specific combination of plant and fungus. For example, plant shoots of Anthoxanthum odoratum are significantly heavier in asso ciation with the fungus Gigaspora gigantea versus the fungus Glomus "white", however, shoots of Rumex acetosella are significantly heavier with G. "white" versus G. gigantea. G. gigantea is a relative mutualist in com bination with A. odoratum, but a relative parasite in combination with R. acetosella. Interactions may be weakly asymmetric. For example, the fun gus Acaulospora trappei derives its greatest benefit from association with the plants Veronica arvensis and Plantago lanceolata, however, the fungus gives its greatest benefit to the plant Allium vineale. Despite this example, investments by plants and AMF are typically reciprocal: if a plant grows larger with a specific fungus, the fungus is likely to sporulate dispropor tionately in association with the same plant. This kind of reciprocity may constrain the evolution of parasitism within the mutualism. PRINTZ, L.,' G. HOELZER' and G.

Lepidium latifolium, an invasive plant species, across two spatial scales. Introduced from Russia in the early 1900's, Lepidium latifolium L., com monly referred to as perennial pepperweed or tall white top, is an aggres sive, perennial species that forms dense, monospecific stands along. The degree of genetic variation within and among L. latifolium stands that grow along the Susan and Truckee Rivers in California and Nevada, respectively was quantified via the RAPD. Twenty stolons were randomly collected from each site and grown in a greenhouse. Fresh leaf tissue was then collected and cleaned. DNA was extracted with the DNeasy Mini Plant Kit (Qiagen) then genotyped with four pre-screened RAPD primers. Estimates of within and between population variation and population subdivision are based on the equations as described by Lynch and Milligan (1994). Within population genetic variation, (Hj(I) = 0.4 and 0.7) for the Truckee and Susan Rivers, respectively. Between population genetic variation for the Susan and Truckee Rivers Hjk = 0.3 and is low but not as compared to other clonal plant species such as geranium, Hjk = 0.4. These results sug gest that despite low genetic diversity L. latifolium is able to out compete native species, lowering species diversity and richness thus, altering ripar ian systems it is found in.

We use research at the scale of stem tissue to reconsider the hypothesis that low net primary production in older forests results from higher res piration costs associated with increased biomass. Gradients of metabolic activity in sapwood (SW) have been examined extensively, but absolute patterns have not been identified. Further, physiological mechanisms con trolling these gradients are poorly understood. SW in older trees has higher percentages of older cells than younger trees, suggesting the possibility of reduced metabolism in older trees because of increased senescence in living cells. Older trees also have a higher percentage of SW distant from mer istimatic tissue than younger trees, suggesting that SW in older trees may play a more prominent role in maintenance than growth. We examined effects of age and position on respiration potential (defined as rate of CO2 release under laboratory conditions) in parenchyma cells of SW in older and younger trees. We took core samples at various positions along stem heights from 100+ and 10+ year-old Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.), PSME and 200+ year-old Pinus ponderosa (Laws.), PIPO trees. Cores were di vided into three radial depths, outer, middle, and inner SW. Rate of CO2 release from tissues was measured using a gas chromatograph. Both PIPO and older PSME outer SW released over twice the amount of CO2 at node 15 (years from top) than at the 200+ and 100+ year-old bases, respectively. Older PSME outer SW at node 35 was also twice as active as at its base, whereas node 50 of PIPO outer SW was equal in activity to its base. Younger PSME outer SW at nodes 2 and 5 were equal in activity, and were 50% less active than older PSME outer SW at node 15. Outer SW was the most active of the SW radial depths, with middle and inner SW activity nearly equal, at all heights in all trees. Most notably, both the base of older PSME with only 35 years SW, and the base of PIPO with 100 years SW, showed similar gradients in activity from outer to inner SW (outer SW twice as active as inner). Our results suggest that age of SW tissue is less of a determinant of respiration potential in parenchyma cells than its position relative to apical or cambial meristems. The homogenous nature in metabolism of older SW in PIPO and PSME reflects its potential role in tissue maintenance. PRYSBY, M. D. and K. S. OBERHAUSER.

In an effort to describe and understand the variation in monarch (Danaus plexippus) distribution and abundance, we have developed a large-scale citizen science project to monitor monarch and milkweed (Asciepias spp.) populations across North America. The Monarch Larval Monitoring Pro ject, now in its fourth year, involves volunteers from the public in data collection efforts. Each volunteer monitors a site weekly throughout the monarch breeding season, following a defined protocol. Since the project's inception, over 80 volunteers have participated, monitoring more than 40 sites in the United States and Canada. The resulting data are compiled to form the foundation of a long-term monarch population database. With these data, we have described consistent trends in interannual variation in 180 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="142">monarch densities and in patterns of monarch recruitment. The results are shared with the volunteers via an annual newsletter and postings to the website. In addition to its research goals, the project works towards edu cation and conservation by improving public understanding of monarch and milkweed biology, general ecological principles, and the process of scientific research. This project may serve as a model of how citizen sci ence can be a useful research tool for scientists while simultaneously serv ing as an effective tool for education and conservation.

A combination of competition and facilitation operating simultaneously among plant species appears to be the rule in nature, where these effects change along productivity gradients often in a non-proportional manner. We investigated changes in competition and facilitation between a legu minous shrub, Retama sphaerocarpa, and its associated understory species along a gradient of resource availability in semi-arid Southeast Spain. Our results showed a change in the net balance of the interaction between the shrub and several of its associated species, from clearly positive in the water-stressed, infertile environment to neutral or even negative in the more fertile habitat. There was a weakening of facilitation along the fertility gradient as a consequence of improved abiotic conditions. Competition was intense for belowground resources in the less fertile environment while aboveground competition increased towards the more productive end of the gradient. Changes in the balance of the interaction between and among different plant species along the gradient of stress were caused by a decline in facilitation rather than by a change in competition. As both competition intensity and facilitation change along gradients of resource availability, plant interactions are best viewed as dynamic relationships the outcome of which depends on abiotic conditions. PUTH, L. M. and T F H. ALLEN. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA. A conceptual clarification of complexity and its applica tion in small aquatic systems. Although there is a great deal of literature exploring the effects of com plexity on community and ecosystem stability, there is little consensus on the magnitude or direction of these impacts. Much of this disparity stems from confusion in the meaning of the terms complexity and stability. While cleaving the general term stability into resistance, resilience, and other mea sures has rendered it more precise, an analogous division of complexity has yet to occur. Here, we parse complexity into two fundamentally distinct components: complicatedness, elaboration at a single level of a hierarchy, and hierarchical organization, elaboration of levels within a hierarchy. Theory predicts that changes in these two aspects of complexity should cause different behaviors in ecosystem function across an ecologically rel evant gradient. For example, the addition of a new species with functional equivalents, a change in complicatedness, should produce little change in ecosystem function, while the addition of a new functional group, a change in hierarchical organization, is likely to show major effects. We propose a method to determine whether ecological variables represent complicated ness or hierarchical organization. Measures that represent complicatedness should change continuously, while variables representing hierarchical or ganization should change discontinuously (e.g., step functions) across any salient gradient. These differences can be distinguished using linear re gression techniques. We compared model predictions to trends for a suite of limnological variables in a set of naturally occurring rock pools in north ern Wisconsin and Minnesota across a gradient of rock pool volume. This method yielded reliable distinction between complicated and hierarchically organized variables. Variables such as phytoplankton and zooplankton spe cies richness showed positive and continuous relationships with rock pool volume, while variables such as the presence or absence of permanent sediment show positive but discontinuous relationships with system size. This research should help clarify the complexity-stability debate by iden tifying the different components of complexity and allowing new evalua tion of the contradictory results of previous studies.

Adsorption of soluble organic nutrients along a primary successional chronosequence in the Mt. Shasta mudflows. In minimally disturbed ecosytems, the major form of N leaching through the soil profile is often dissolved organic N. We hypothesize that the pro portion of dissolved organic C, N, and P generated in the organic horizon which leaches through the soil profile decreases during soil development due to weathering and formation of oxyhydroxides and clays. The high adsorption capacity of allophane and imogolite formed from volcanic ma terials should result in a rapid increase in the capacity of soils derived from volcanic materials to retain soluble organic forms of nutrients. Soils from a 75 to approximately 1200 year chronosequence of mudflows were sub jected to adsorption isotherm experiments. While adsorption increased with soil age, even the oldest mudflow soil had relatively low adsorption ca pacity. RAAB, T. K.' and M. C.

SIR microscopic vi sualization of legume root responses to low-phosphorus. Synchrotron radiation sources provide bright light in the mid-infrared (2.5 to 16 jim wavelengths), and may be used as external light sources for microscopy. In root microcosms fitted with IR-transmissive windows, one may spectroscopically characterize and image roots and associated exudates with spatial resolution as small as 10 microns. We compared root chemical responses of two legumes, Vigna mungo and Lupinus arizonicus to low phosphorus availability. In the case of the cultivated mungbean, large amounts of aromatic/aliphatic carboxylates were detected in the spectral region of 1050-700 cm-' under low P, while desert lupines created a variety of organic-coated salt inclusions in the root zone, with IR absorbances typical of gypsum. One can use the chemically-encoded information from reflection spectra to produce maps of: (1) root respiration (CO2 absorbance at 2300-2400 cm-'), (2) root epidermal tissues (-CH2 absorbances at 2800 2900 cm-'), and (3) root exudates (several carbohydrate and organic acid features from 1300-900 cm-'). These maps show the uneven distribution of respiration along roots, and the specialization of particular zones along roots as sources of exudates.

Hyperspectral (narrow-band) remotely sensed data are useful for studying ecosystem processes and patterns. But spatial characterization of the re motely sensed images is needed to optimize sampling procedures and to address scaling issues. We have investigated the spatial scaling issue in hyperspectral data for canopy and watershed level ecosystem studies in the Santa Monica region of southern California. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI (a greenness index), WBI (a water content index), and PRI (a photosynthetic index) were used as potential indicators of biomass and physiological fluxes of grass and chaparral vegetation in that region. We found that the low altitude (-4 km above sea level) AVIRIS images were very suitable for studying variations in these indices between individual plant canopies. Semivariogram analyses using ground-based 1-m resolution hyperspectral data and AVIRIS images showed that the 4-m pixels of low altitude AVIRIS images satisfactorily retained the variability associated with individual canopies. On the other hand, 20-in pixels of high altitude (-20 km above sea level) AVIRIS images failed to capture canopy-level variability, but were suitable for studying watershed level processes. RAICH, J.

Carbon dioxide emissions from soils generally increase with temperature. Thus, there exists the potential for a positive feedback in which global Oral Presentation Abstracts 181</page><page sequence="143">warming would stimulate soil CO2 emissions, thereby exacerbating further warming. We used a previously published model to estimate global soil carbon dioxide emissions for each month from 1980-1994, based on monthly precipitation and air temperature data. This period included the warmest years yet recorded. Estimated annual soil-CO2 emissions ranged from 81-84 Pg C, suggesting that variations in soil respiration rates con tribute to interannual variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Low er-than-average rainfall decreased estimated soil respiration rates in some years. Overall, however, there was an overriding effect of temperature on predicted soil-CO2 emissions. For each 0.1 degree increase in temperature, the predicted global annual soil respiration rate increased by an average of 0.7 Pg carbon. A mean global temperature increase of 1 degree Centigrade would therefore be expected to cause an increase in soil respiration rates that exceeds annual CO2 inputs from fossil-fuel combustion. Evaluation of the impact of these predicted changes on the terrestrial C budget requires integration of our data with estimates of changes in net primary productiv ity. Our preliminary model results suggest two working hypotheses. In wet years, increasing temperatures are predicted to generate a net loss of C from terrestrial ecosystems. In dry years, soil respiration rates are predicted to decrease faster than NPP, and therefore generate net C storage on land. RAND, T A. Brown University, Providence RI 02912 USA. Herbivore mediated apparent competition between two host plants in a New Eng land salt marsh. Herbivore damage to the salt marsh plant Atriplex patula, by the Chryso melid beetle Erynephala maritima, is often more intense on plants that are associated with a second host plant species, Salicornia europaea, than on plants growing individually or with conspecifics. The objective of the study was to examine whether this pattern of associational susceptibility resulted in an herbivore mediated negative interaction, or apparent competition, be tween host plant species in the field. Host plant density /composition and herbivore presence or absence were manipulated in a factorial design. Host density manipulations included three treatments: Low density Atriplex plants, high density Atriplex monocultures, and high density Atriplex-Sal icornia mixtures. In the presence of herbivores, Atriplex survival was low est for plants growing with Salicornia, intermediate for plants in high den sity monocultures and highest in low density treatments. These differences in survival were not significant in herbivore exclusion treatments, indicat ing that the effects were indirectly mediated through herbivores rather than a direct competitive effect of plant neighbors. Egg and larval densities were found to be significantly greater in plots where Salicornia was present, resulting in greater plant damage in these same treatments. A strong ten dency for females to oviposit in the vicinity of Salicornia, coupled with limited mobility of larvae at early instars, is likely to be responsible for driving the strong negative effects of Salicornia presence on Atriplex sur vival.

Patch isolation and priority effects and the structure of arthropod com munities inhabiting creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in central Arizo na. Habitat fragmentation is accelerating, especially in urban settings like Phoenix, Arizona, and is thought to greatly affect community diversity. Creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) is populated by a diverse and abundant arthropod community making it a model system in which to study concepts central to community ecology such as the impacts of habitat patch isolation and priority effects on arthropod community structure. To quantify the im pact of patch isolation on creosote bush arthropods I compared the com position of communities in two natural desert areas (located on the outskirts of Phoenix) to those in two isolated desert remnants (located within the Phoenix metropolitan area). Composition of communities was determined by sampling arthropods on creosote bush every two weeks from March November 1999. Arthropod communities were richer on creosote bushes located in natural desert areas than in isolated desert remnants. Addition ally, during some time periods greater numbers of individuals occurred on creosote bushes located in natural desert areas than in isolated desert rem nants. I conducted a priority effects pilot to investigate the influence of pioneer colonists on the recovery of arthropod communities to previously defaunated creosote bushes. This experiment consisted of removing all ar thropods from bushes and then seeding the bushes with the following pi oneer colonists in natural densities: 1) Leaf hoppers, 2) jumping spiders, and 3) no pioneers. No differences in the relative recovery of arthropod communities were observed among treatments suggesting that priority ef fects may not be important in structuring creosote bush arthropod com munities following disturbance.

Two predictions derived from this paradigm are (1) that vegetation should tend to redistribute internal resources such that all external resources are equally limiting and (2) that if an external resource can be acquired from two sources, the less costly source will be exploited. We assume a fixed C cost of N fixation and assess the cost of N uptake as the decrease in photosynthesis per unit increase in N uptake as a result of reallocating internal resources below ground. Using the Multiple-Element Limitation (MEL) model, we examine these tradeoffs and conclude that N fixation will tend to be favored when: 1.) CO2 concentration is high so there is a high return on resource allocation to the canopy; 2.) available N concentration is low so there is a low return on resource allocation below ground; 3.) the canopy is open so there is a high return on resource allo cation to the canopy; and 4.) the soil is well exploited by roots so there is a low return on resource allocation below ground. Evolution may not have had time to act upon the first of these criteria, which would result in sub optimal resource allocations under elevated C02. We derive an equation that automatically scales the relative contributions of these four criteria and predicts the conditions under which symbiotic fixation should occur (e.g., early succession). RAY, A. M.' and A. J. REBERTUS.2 'Idaho State University, Pocatello, ID 83201, U.S.A.; 2Northern Michigan University, Marquette, MI, U.S.A. Macrophyte succession in beaver ponds. Beavers have been described as keystone species, because their impound ments and cutting activities dramatically alter nutrient cycles and food chains in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. We documented macrophyte succession by sampling 36 beaver ponds ranging from 4 to &gt;40 years. We used impounded peatlands rather than streams, because the former were isolated from other water bodies and were less prone to washouts. Richness and diversity in ponds increased linearly during the first four decades and stabilized thereafter. Pond age and the interaction of pond size and number of neighboring-ponds within a 0.25-km radius explained 64% (P&lt;0.001) of the variation in species richness. Most compositional trends were best explained by propagule dispersal traits. Initial colonists included the most vagile species, like free-floating macrophytes (e.g. Lemnaceae), and desir able food sources for waterfowl, like the narrow-leaved pondweeds (e.g. Potamogeton pusillus ). Ponds of intermediate age (11 to 40 years) had highest diversity, with both floating-leaved and submersed life forms well represented. Two community types were identified in the oldest ponds (&gt;40 years): One characterized by dense lily pad cover with shade-tolerant Cer atophyllum demersum beneath, and the other characterized by a rich as semblage of Potamogeton and lacking significant lily pad cover. Trends in macrophytes succession may impact many aquatic organisms and ecosys tem processes within beaver ponds, and our results may contribute to better understanding the dynamics of these regionally abundant habitats.

A simple metapopulation model based on relationships between local demographic rates and regional density. Increasing fragmentation may endanger the remaining populations of a threatened cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi). Age-structured data available for several remaining interconnected stream populations show that survival within streams is a function of density summed across streams within this watershed. In some streams and age classes, local sur 182 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="144">vival is negatively related to watershed-level density; in others, local sur vival is positively related to watershed-level density. These relationships suggest density-dependent movement of fish between streams. Relation ships between local recruitment and the density of reproductives across the watershed also vary between streams. A simple metapopulation model is developed from these density-dependent relationships. This model requires no explicit dispersal data. By using the observed relationships between local demographic rates and metapopulation density, the model allows for implicit effects of both dispersal and habitat quality. Local dynamics are semi-independent, influenced by local response to regional stream flow which forces population fluctuation and fish redistribution. This modeling approach is superior to modeling local populations independently, which requires the often unrealistic assumption that local emigration and immi gration will not vary with regional dynamics. The predictions of such 'l ocal' models are compared with the predictions of this metapopulation model and with trout census data. Predictions from the metapopulation model are in better agreement with data. Results indicate the importance of metapopulation dynamics for persistence of this species. REBECCA ALLEE, D., D. DAIL BROWN and D. TOM HOURIGAN. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Silver Spring MD 20910 USA. Marine and estuarine habitat classification. Marine species and their habitats are increasingly threatened by impacts from development, pollution, fishing activities and other human activities. Conserving biodiversity is essential if we are to succeed in sustaining our coastal and ocean resources. However, the historical approach to species conservation has been one at a time and is often unsuccessful. The tradi tional species-by-species approach to conservation and management can no longer stand alone, and must be supplemented by efforts that conserve whole habitats and their natural communities. Conservationists are now recognizing the need for an ecosystem approach to conservation which requires that we consider the natural biodiversity of the system. However, before we can conserve the biodiversity, we must first have a better un derstanding of what resources we have and where they exist. Such efforts require that mappers, resource managers, and scientists have a common "language" with which to describe habitats of concern and to effectively conserve our resources, we must have a system that will allow us to pri oritize our conservation needs. This can be accomplished through devel opment of a marine ecosystem classification system. In pursuit of such a system, the Ecological Society of America and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently hosted a workshop to develop a na tional marine and estuarine habitat classification system. Prior to that work shop, a synthesis of existing systems was compiled for use during the workshop. Using the synthesis and expert knowledge, the participants of the workshop were able to identify essential habitat parameters, such as depth, energy regime, hydrogeomorphic features, and substratum, among others, for use in habitat classification. The result was a descriptive eco system and habitat classification system for marine and estuarine waters that incorporates these important parameters. The higher levels of this clas sification system address broad-scale parameters while the lowest level pulls in the biodiversity of a specific habitat type. RECHEL, J. L., D. M. FREEMAN and D. A. LARSON. USDA Forest Service, Riverside, CA 92507-6099 USA. Effects of landscape structure on avian community compostion and probability of occurrence in fire dominated Mediterranean ecosystems. Some populations of migratory and resident birds in the Mediterranean ecosystem in southern California have declined due to many factors in cluding urban developments, habitat conversions, and alteration of the 'na tural' fire regime. Indeed, because of fire suppression, the absence of fire may be an important factor that contributes to habitat changes and subse quent population declines. Habitat requirements of birds are often inferred by correlating bird abundance and occurrence with features of occupied habitats. Such correlations might not appropriately weight habitat features. Habitat associations and probability of occurrence were modeled using lo gistic regression in conjunction with a geographic information system (GIS). The model used topography, vegetation type, structure and diversity of canopy, shrub, and herbaceous layers, fire disturbance, precipitation, temperature, presence or absence of water, and landscape structure. Surveys were conducted on the San Dimas Experimental Forest and the San Jacinto Ranger District for four years (1997-2000) to determine which habitat fea tures are important to occurrence and distribution of birds. Data were col lected during the spring and early summer (March-June) on 191 fixed circular point plots. Birds were assigned to migrant, partial migrant, and resident categories. Model accuracy was good and ranged from 79.8% to 88%. Important habitat features for migrants and partial migrants were presence of water or high structural diversity and composition of vegetation patches, while for residents were &lt; 30 percent canopy cover, &gt; 70 percent shrub cover, homogenous patches of old growth ( &gt; 40 years) chaparral stands, and adjacency of these stands to mixed oak woodland and riparian areas. This suggests that old growth stands of chaparral are ecologically important to many species of birds and that the more typical fire interval of 50 to 70 years for mixed chaparral is likely beneficial. By calculating probabilities of occurrence and distribution using logistic regression, and using them to derive maps, results more accurately reflect the use of spatial features. These probability maps may be useful to design and implement habitat conservation policies and changes in fire suppression and prescribed fire programs. REHAGE, J., A. SIH, B. BARNETT and E. MAURER. University of Ken tucky, Lexington, KY 40506 USA. Feeding preferences of invasive vs. noninvasive Gambusia species. A central question in the study of biological invasions is: What are the key ecological, genetic, life-history, and behavioral traits that characterize suc cessful invaders? While there are hypotheses on traits that one might expect in successful invaders, few studies have tested these hypotheses. Studying closely related and morphologically similar taxa allows one to identify traits associated with invasions. A good system is the poeciliid fish, Gam busia, where the differences in geographic range and invasive ability are extreme. Gambusia affinis and Gambusia holbrooki (mosquitofish) have widespread distributions and have been successfully introduced for mos quito control in every continent except Antarctica. In contrast, other Gam busia are extremely restricted in range, including five U.S. species with protected status and two species now considered extinct. Behavioral traits might be a critical component of invasion success. Behavioral plasticity should be an important attribute of successful invaders when confronted with novel environments or novel prey. In this study, I focus on feeding behavior, a hypothesized key behavioral trait that may explain variation in invasive ability in this genus. I compare feeding preferences of four species: The widespread and invasive sister species G. affinis and G. holbrooki (mosquitofish), and two restricted species, G. geiseri and G. hispaniolae . G. geiseri is native to the two largest springs in Texas, and it is the only Texan endemic Gambusia species without protected status. G. hispaniolae is native to the Dominican Republic in the island of Hispaniola. Three prey types were used in this experiment, a surface (vestigial winged Drosophila ), a pelagic (Daphnia) , and a benthic (the isopod, Lirceusfontinalis ) prey. Encounter rates, attack rates, capture success, and feeding rates were quan tified for each prey type from videotaped feeding trials. I tested the hy potheses that invasive species should be less choosy in their diets and should have higher feeding rates across the three prey types. Some of the results fit these hypotheses well, while surprisingly others do not. REICE, S. R. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3280. The impact and persistence of sediment pollution from construction sites on stream community structure. A critical problem in American rivers and streams is sedimentation. Sedi mentation degrades the water quality, impairs the habitat for fish and ma croinvertebrates, and limits the ecosystem functions and services of rivers and streams. In this study, we measured the community structure of the benthic communities of 18 medium sized creeks and streams in Piedmont North Carolina. This is part of a broader project studying the effectiveness of different sediment and erosion control ordinances in different jurisdic tions in North Carolina. We collected general water chemistry and benthic data from all streams. We analyzed total abundance, total species richness and H' diversity for 1) all taxa, 2) EPT taxa (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Tricoptera) and 3) Chironomidae. We sampled before construction be gan, during construction and after the construction was completed. We compared stream sites as follows: upstream (control) sites vs. the construc Oral Presentation Abstracts 183</page><page sequence="145">tion site to a downstream (recovery) site. Using streams as replicates to avoid pseudoreplication, we found that EPT abundance, richness and di versity were the most sensitive to sedimentation. EPT values were consis tently depressed by sedimentation at the impact site during construction. The post-construction recovery at the impact site was incomplete, but im proved downstream. More effective erosion and sedimentation control is needed to protect stream communities. RENTMEESTER, S.,' N. NADKARNI' and J.

Host tree specificity of epiphytic bromeliads on trees in tropical experimental plots, La Selva, Costa Rica. This study documents host specificity in epiphytic bromeliads in a lowland wet tropical forest. We quantified the relative abundance, community com position, diversity, and spatial distribution of epiphytic bromeliads in monospecific stands. The experimental stands were planted using a repli cated block design. We related these measurements to the age (four- and eight-year-old) and species (Cedrela ordorata, Cordia alliodora, and Hy eronima alchorneoides) of the host. Age had the strongest influence on mean density of bromeliads per tree with an order of magnitude between eight-year-old (mean=17.63) and four-year-old (mean=1.42) host. Mean density showed significant differences among the three hosts within eight year-old (F=226.943, P=0.000) and four-year-old (Chi squared=47.151, P=0.000) trees. Age was also a significant factor for species diversity (F=130.409, P=0.000) with diversity decreasing in the older hosts. Bro meliad diversity depended on host species in both eight-year-old (F= 111.013, P=0.00) and four-year-old (F= 16.905, P=0.000) hosts. Both mean density of bromeliads per tree and bromeliad size class distribution showed a host-specific vertical shift. RESETARITS, JR., W. J. Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529, USA. You CAN take it with you: Colonization success and population structure of female- and pair- founded populations of Gambusia affinis. Many theories have been proposed to explain the evolution and mainte nance of sexual reproduction. A common thread is the presumed fitness advantage accrued to parents producing more genetically diverse progeny. This advantage must overcome the reproductive efficiency of asexual re production. Among vertebrates, where sexual reproduction predominates, parthenogenesis is found in a very few taxa and correlated with environ mental conditions, particularly disturbance, where its reproductive advan tage confers an even greater advantage for (re)colonization. While parthe nogenesis is rare in vertebrates, certain species display life histories that presumably obtain some of the same advantages, while maintaining the genetic diversity of sexual reproduction. Female mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, store sperm from one or more males and use that sperm to fertilize susequent broods. This presumably allows a female in a natural population to be a foundress any time after sexual maturity. Several basic questions arise in regard to this life history; What percentage of mature females in nature can successfully found populations at any given time, and does this differ from the success rate of pairs from the same population? Do popu lations founded by females differ in growth rate and population structure from those founded by male/female pairs? I introduced G. affinis into 24 experimental mesocosms, 12 receiving a single mature female and 12 male/ female pairs. There was no difference in founding success rate for females (83%) vs pairs (75%). After seven weeks populations consisted, on average, of 5.0 males, 7.5 females, 31.9 fry, and 117.7 eggs and eyed embryos. Numbers of males, females, immatures, embryos, and eggs did not differ between female-founded and pair- founded populations, nor did average size of males, females and fry. A significant effect of foundress final size on the number of immatures, embryos and eggs produced was the only significant observed relationship. Interual fertilization and sperm storage allows mature females the colonization advantage of parthenogens, while maintaining the advantages of sexual reproduction. Individual females were as successful in founding populations as pairs, and populations founded by females were indistinguishable from those founded by pairs. RESH, S. C.' and D. BINKLEY.2 'CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products, TAS Australia; 2Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA . Ni trogen-fixing tropical trees sequester soil carbon. Anthropogenic increases in nitrogen inputs may enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration through increased plant production. The increase in nitrogen supply may also affect soil carbon sequestration through altered decom position. We examined soil carbon pools under tropical plantations of ni trogen-fixing tree species and Eucalyptus that replaced agricultural land use. Using stable carbon isotopes, we tracked the loss of old soil organic carbon from the previous C4 land use (SOC4) and the gain of new soil organic carbon from the C3 forest plantations (SOC3). We found 0.06 kg C4 m-2 yrlgreater retention of the old, agricultural soil carbon and 0.05 kg C3 m-2 yrlgreater new carbon accretion under the N-fixers relative to Eu calyptus. Both the greater old carbon retention and greater new carbon accretion corresponded with nitrogen accretion (P &lt; 0.01). The effect of increased nitrogen supply on soil carbon retention may be an important mechanism of carbon sequestration that is not currently considered in glob al change research. REYNOLDS, R. J. and J. R. OTT. Southwest Texas State University, San Marcos, TX 78666, U.S.A. The role of parasitoids in determining gall size and success of a host-specific cynipid. Large gall size is considered adaptive for a number of insect gall-formers because the probability of successful development and emergence of the gall-former increases with gall size. This interpretation may be warranted when gall size and percent parasitism are negatively correlated and gall growth is not halted by parasitism. Using the host-specific gall-former, Belonocnema treatae (Cynipidae: Hymenoptera) which induces galls on the leaves of Quercusfusiformis, we tested two hypotheses: (1) emergence success increases with gall size and (2) the distribution of gall sizes at maturity is independent of parasitism. To test hypothesis one, we collected mature galls in 1998 prior to gall-former emergence from 5 trees in 3 natural populations (n = 21,000 galls total). Galls were measured, individ ually housed in gelatin capsules, and scored for gall-former emergence. In all populations the probability of gall-former emergence increased expo nentially with gall size. Moreover, over all sites percent emergence/tree increased linearly with mean gall size/tree (n = 15 trees). To test hypothesis two, we conducted a parasitoid exclusion experiment during the 1999 field season. On each of 6 Q. fusiformis trees 15 branches were bagged and stocked with equal numbers of female B. treatae. Following oviposition parasitoid exclusion, bag control, and open treatments were created. The mean size of galls protected from parasitism was significantly larger than galls exposed to natural levels of parasitism, a result which may in our study system complicate the common interpretation of large gall size as an adaptation to thwart insect parasitoids.

N source diversity promotes plant community diversity under N-lim iting conditions. We manipulated microbial diversity (inoculated or not) and diversity in N source (NH4+NO3+urea or NH4 alone) in greenhouse microcosms seeded to yield initially equal densities of old-field perennials. Microcosms con sisted of 0.1 m2 pots filled with sterilized flaked silica clay (turface?) as the growing medium. The experiment was conducted at two levels of over all N fertility (low and high), in each case using 8 perennials typical of low or 8 perennials typical of high fertility soil. We found that increasing the diversity of N sources led to a significant increase in plant community diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) at low overall N fertility, but had no effect on plant diversity at high overall N fertility where light penetration to the soil surface was lowest. Microbial diversity had no effect on plant community diversity, although preliminary data show no difference in av erage microbial activity levels between inoculated versus non-inoculated pots. These results suggest that niche partitioning among multiple forms of N may contribute to plant species coexistence under conditions in which N is a relatively more limiting resource than light. 184 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="146">RHOADS, A.

Characterizing susceptibility to and effects of the January 1998 ice storm in the White Mountain National Forest, NH. A major ice storm struck the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada in January 1998. The storm, considered the worst forest disturbance in the area since the hurricane of 1938, provided a rare opportunity to study ice storm disturbance at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a long-term ecological research site. The purpose of this study was to doc ument susceptibility to ice damage in portions of the northern hardwood forest. Methods used to measure damage included leaf area index (LAI) measurements using Li-Cor's LAI-2000 and visual damage class assess ments based on branch loss. We found that elevation, tree diameter (dbh), species composition, and tree health were key factors in determining sus ceptibility at HBEE No elevational effect on damage was found within the impacted zone, but there was significantly higher damage above approxi mately 600 m. Damage was also significantly greater in trees with larger diameters (dbh). Plot damage increased with higher beech (Fagus grandi folia) biomass, while sugar maple (Acer saccharum) was the most resistant of the dominant species at HBEE The susceptibility of beech can be partly explained by its mechanical properties and also by the presence of beech bark disease. Trees with more severe beech bark disease experienced more ice damage. Because storm damage was heterogeneous across the impacted areas, data was also collected at four other sites near HBEE Elevation, tree size, and species composition continued to determine susceptibility, though patterns differed across the sites. The varied damage patterns and inter specific differences in susceptibility within and between sites suggest that both local and landscape-level changes in community structure may result from this rare event.

Age, size, and genetic structure of Chesapeake Bay eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) demes. Preliminary allozyme surveys of Chesapeake Bay (Virginia, USA) popu lations of the clonal marine angiosperm Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) re vealed substantial amounts of geographically-partitioned genetic variation. The observed population structure could be the result of adaptation to dif ferent environments or of nonselective processes, including founder events and drift. Two important demographic factors that vary among eelgrass populations and could affect genetic structure are age and size. To deter mine the effects of age and size on genetic diversity and structure in Ches apeake Bay eelgrass, we did an allozyme survey of 100 randomly-selected individuals from four replicate demes of three types [old (&gt;65 years) and large (&gt;100 hectares); old and small (&lt;10 ha); young (&lt;10 years) and small]. Genetic diversity at each of ten allozyme loci tested was greater among populations than within populations (FST = 0.78), and little genetic sub-structuring was evident within demes. Populations were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p &gt; 0.05). Old, large populations contained less genetic diversity than young, small populations. Data from our allozyme survey, combined with results of reciprocal transplant experiments, indicate that selective forces and local adaptation might contribute much to the genetic structure of eelgrass populations. Studies of genetic diversity within and among these demes will help identify other forces that structure pop ulations of this ecologically important species, allowing evolutionary in terpretations and predictions to be made and management strategies cre ated.

Effects of treefalls and topography on species composition and diver sity at different spatial scales in a NW Argentina neotropical montane forest. I describe tree species composition (5 cm DBH), Slope, Aspect, and treefall regime (using dendroecological techniques) in six hectares of subtropical montane forest. Time-since-gap showed spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) at spatial scales 5000 in2. Point pattern analysis (Ripley's K) showed that recent treefalls (1990-1997) are spatially aggregated at 500 in2, and are spatially associated with previous treefalls (1978-1987) at spatial scales of 1500-3000 M2. Ordination scores (NMDS) of plots (species composition) correlated with Slope at 400 m2, and with Aspect at larger spatial scales. At scales of 2500 m2, the factors best correlated with ordination axes were Number of treefalls and Time-since-gap. At the scale of individual gaps ( 500 m2), however, the treefall regime descriptors were not correlated with species composition. Both correlation of species richness with treefall re gime and discrimination of light-demanding and shade-tolerant species in the ordination analysis increased abruptly at scales 2000 M2. At scales corresponding to individual gaps, composition and diversity were unrelated with treefall regime, but at the scale of aggregations of several treefalls, treefall regime was a good predictor of species richness and composition of regeneration groups. This can be attributed to the fact that treefall ag gregations increase the probability of new treefalls being colonized by light-demanding species. The results emphasize the importance of scale in interpreting the relationship between canopy disturbances and forest com position and diversity. RICCARDI, C. L. and B. C. MCCARTHY.

The relationship between wildland fire intensity, fire temperature, and the response of plant and animal populations is complex. Few studies have experimentally examined fire temperatures and oak seed germination at fine spatial scales. To examine temperature patterns characteristic of the Ap palachian mixed-oak hardwood region, we exposed aluminum tags painted with temperature-sensitive paints (38-427 C) and placed them at -2, +2, and +12 cm relative to the soil surface. The sensors were arranged in 1 by 1 m grids with 25 cm spacing distances, and burned in oak litter. Below ground (&lt;30 C) sensors were spatially homogeneous across the experi mental burn plots. Sensors in the leaf litter experienced the most variable temperatures (range: 110-370 C) and greatest spatial variability. An inter mediate range of spatial variability was recorded at +12cm (150-330 C). A subsequent study designed to examine fire temperature on oak seed ger mination used 423 Quercus prinus seeds. The treatments varied seed po sition (above- or below-ground), temperature (Control, 38, 66, 150, 204, &amp; 260 C), and exposure time (5 or 15 min). Time and temperature were highly significant (P&lt;0.001) and affected seed germination. Seed exposure to temperature above 150C for more than 5 minutes yielded decreased germination (21.3%) compared to lower temperature and time treatments (75.1%). Temperature at 204C for 15 min usually resulted in complete mortality. We hypothesize that caching of Q. prinus seed by squirrels Sciu rus spp. could increase seed survival during wildland fires.

While many organisms exhibit density-dependent growth and/or survival, some ecologists have hypothesized that the density of juvenile estuarine dependent fishes is constrained by the number of larvae transported to nursery areas, and typically remains below carrying capacity, preventing food limitation and density-dependent effects. This question has gained additional significance as hypoxic conditions due to excessive nutrient loading substantially reduce the amount of available habitat. We conducted two experiments to test for density-dependent growth and survival of ju venile spot Leiostomus xanthurus. In the first experiment fish were placed in 1-IM2 cages in an estuarine marsh creek at densities of 0, 2, 5, and 10 fish/M2 (6 replicates each) and their growth and survival were determined after 51 d. In the second experiment spot were stocked in 79_M2 pond sections at densities of 0, 2, 5 and 10/M2 (2 replicates each) and their growth and survival were determined after 52 d. Benthic core samples were also taken to assess the effects of spot densities on infaunal prey. In both experiments spot growth and survival were significantly reduced as fish density increased. Growth rate increased 5 to 30-fold as spot density de clined from 10 to 2 fish/in2, and P (mortality) increased 2 to 5-fold with increasing spot density. At the end of the pond experiment, densities of benthic meiofauna commonly fed upon by spot declined significantly with increasing spot density. Estimates of spot density gleaned from the litera ture indicate that these density-dependent effects occur well within the Oral Presentation Abstracts 185</page><page sequence="147">range of realistic field densities. These results suggest that hypoxic events may have substantial indirect effects on fish populations as habitat reduc tions (often 30-50%) result in increased densities in remaining habitat. RICHARDS, S. A. I and W. G. WILSON.2 'University of Amsterdam, NL; 2Duke University, NC USA. Adaptive feeding across environmental gra dients. A mathematical model is used to investigate a consumer's adaptive feeding response to environmental gradients. Consumers compete exploitatively for a renewing resource that is distributed among many discrete patches. Each consumer removes resources from a patch down to some threshold density before seeking resources elsewhere. Assuming consumers trade off re source extraction with patch access and predation we show that for a given environment there often exists a single evolutionarily stabe feeding thresh old and it is an evolutionary attractor. The model predicts that when the environment becomes less harsh (i.e., the risk of predation is reduced, or patches become more abundant) selection favors consumers with a lower feeding threshold. The model also predicts that a population that adapts its feeding threshold in a varying environment can exhibit quite different dy namics when compared with a population that exhibits a fixed feeding threshold. We compare and contrast our results with the well known mar ginal value theorem. RICHMOND, C. E.,1 D. L. BREITBURGI and K. A.

Can functional redundancy in primary producer assemblages and var iability in consumer populations buffer communities from multiple stressors? Environmental conditions can affect a consumer directly through changes in survival, fecundity, behavior, and metabolic activities, or indirectly through effects on lower trophic levels. An assemblage with multiple spe cies performing similar functional roles may buffer the system from stress or effects, due to the differential sensitivities of functionally redundant members. We were interested in the direct effects of stressors on a primary consumer as well as how the community composition of its food source influences the capacity of an assemblage to buffer against stressors. To examine the relationships between functional redundancy, buffering from stressors, and stressor effects, we modeled a primary producer (phytoplank ton) assemblage with different degrees of functional redundancy, and then exposed the assemblage to common estuarine stressors (nutrient loading and trace metals). The consumer species in this model was the planktonic copepod Acartia tonsa, an ubiquitous and important primary consumer in estuarine systems. We enabled A. tonsa to experience both the direct effects of stressors on growth and development, and the indirect effects of shifts in the phytoplankton community it preys upon. The copepods were mod eled using an individual-based approach with variability in sizes and bio energetic characteristics, resulting in a range of individual types and pos sible responses to environmental conditions. Individual variability played an important role in A. tonsa's direct responses to stressors. Functional redundancy in the primary producer assemblage provided some protection for copepods from the indirect effects of stressors, provided that at least one species in a functional group was either insensitive to the stressor or had a complimentary response to those species negatively impacted. If a species within a functional group were negatively impacted, A. tonsa ex perienced the additional indirect effects of stressors, ultimately impacting copepod vital rates, population dynamics, and the characteristics of the surviving population. These results highlight the importance of understand ing both direct and indirect effects of stressors on natural systems, as well as the role of community composition in determining impacts on higher trophic levels. RICKETIS, T. H. Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5020. The matrix matters: Effective isolation in fragmented landscapes. Habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity by isolating populations in remnant patches, thereby increasing their extinction risk. The classical the ories applied to such landscapes assume that the matrix surrounding the fragments is uniform; isolation is measured by distance alone. I conducted a mark-release-recapture study on 21 species of butterflies in 14 meadow patches and found that the type of surrounding matrix can significantly influence patch isolation. I used maximum likelihood techniques to estimate the relative resistances to butterfly movement of the two matrix types in the landscape: conifer and willow. For the majority of taxa studied, conifer was 2.5-11 times more resistant than willow. For the remaining taxa, re sistance estimates were not significantly different, suggesting that responses to matrix differ even among closely related taxa. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing the "effective isolation" of habitat patches and the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes. RISENG, C. M.,' M. J.

Direct and indirect effects of disturbance and nutrients on stream communities of the Midwestern U.S.: Covariance structure analysis. The influence of hydrologic disturbance and nutrient levels on algal and benthic invertebrate standing stock and taxa richness was examined in streams of the Midwestern United States. Biota and nutrient chemistry were sampled and channel morphology, benthic substrate and discharge were measured in streams representing both nutrient and hydrologic disturbance gradients during the summers of 1996 and 1997. Metrics of flood and drought flow intensity, frequency and variability were developed based on measured morphological characters and long-term hydrologic gauge data. Direct and indirect effects of hydrologic and hydraulic disturbance on tro phic transfer of nutrients to invertebrate biomass were examined using co variance structure models. These models suggest that both flood and drought flow have strong negative direct effects on benthic herbivore stand ing stock. Flood flow had a negative direct effect and drought flow had a positive direct effect on algal biomass. Nutrients had a strong positive direct effect on algal biomass. Algae had a positive but weak effect on grazers while grazers had reciprocal negative effects on algal standing stock. This pattern suggests that flood flows sufficient to move benthic substrate and drought flows sufficient to support ponded pools have a pos itive indirect effect on algal biomass by reducing the invertebrate grazing community and temporarily releasing periphyton from grazing pressure. Covariance structure models relating disturbance, standing stock and taxa richness of invertebrates suggest that disturbance negatively influences taxa richness but only though indirect effects on invertebrate biomass.

Scaling of resource heterogeneity and the coexistence of species. Ecologists still search for common principles that predict well-known re sponses of biological diversity to different factors, including the habitat structure, productivity, area, species' body size, and habitat fragmentation. Here, we show that all these patterns can arise from simple constraints on how organisms acquire resources in space. We use fractal geometry to describe how species of different size find food in patches of varying size and resource concentration. We then derive a mathematical model for the minimum similarity in size of species that share these resources. The model yields a theory of species diversity that makes a number of novel predic tions about the size structure and diversity patterns of species that use similar resources, including diversity-size relationships, species-area curves, diversity vs. productivity, and the effects of habitat fragmentation on diversity. We focus here on two particular model predictions: The great er size-similarity of large species and left-skewed, rather than log-normal or right-skewed, distributions of diversity vs. size. We tested these predic tions for a sap-feeding insect community with an experimental garden that manipulated the spatial distribution of grasses of different quality indepen dently of productivity. In agreement with model predictions, we found tighter species-packing and greater species richness in plots with more ag gregated distributions of grasses. Body-size patterns from extant old-field sap-feeding insect communities near our garden also support our model. These results suggest that scaling of resource use by species of different body size may explain many diversity patterns for local guilds of species that use similar resources. 186 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="148">RIZZO, D.

Fire suppression and meadow draining have led to increased densities of conifers at the expense of previously dominant meadow and oak woodland vegetation types since Euroamerican settlement of Yosemite Valley 150 years ago. Mixed-conifer forests now cover over 50 % of the area in the valley; Pinus ponderosa and Calocedrus decurrens are the dominant spe cies with lesser numbers of Quercus kellogii, Abies concolor, and Pseu dotsugae menziesii. Based on a transect survey of the undeveloped western end of the valley, we estimate that approximately 31 % of the mixed-conifer forest is in expanded gaps. Surveyed gaps had a mean area of 1007 m2 (median 459 m2, range of 81 to 8300 m2). Root disease was associated with over 80 % of all gaps and was the most common form of disturbance. Heterobasidion annosum (30% of gaps) and Armillaria mellea (30%) were the most common root pathogens; other pathogens were associated with 7 % of gaps. Bark beetles were associated with all root disease gaps, often as the final cause of death of infected trees, but were solely responsible for tree mortality in 14% of gaps. Gaps caused by combinations of biotic and abiotic (fire, wind) factors were associated with 19 % of gaps. Given the extent of root disease in the valley, excluding such long term factors as climate, and with fires suppressed, we believe root disease is now the pre dominant ecological factor driving forest succession in Yosemite Valley. Root disease gaps differ from episodic gap-causing factors, such as fire, wind, or bark beetles, in that they may enlarge over decades due to spread of the pathogen to adjacent trees. Enlarging gaps tend to have chronic tree mortality in all stages of decay, whereas episodic occur during one or a few years leading to a homogeneous cohort of trees decaying at a similar rate through time. The high prevalence of root disease in Yosemite Valley appears to be the result of a series of natural resource management actions taken many years earlier. ROBERTS, S. D.' and T. J.

Accurate estimation of leaf area index (LAI) is crucial for investigations into the production ecology of forested systems. One means of estimating LAI is through the use of allometric relationships between individual-tree leaf area (LA) and either breast-height stem diameter (DBH) or sapwood cross-sectional area. These relationships, once thought to be universal for a given species, have more recently been shown been shown to vary by site. Modern plantation forestry uses a variety of genotypes which can vary in LAI. To better understand how individual trees accumulate LA in plan tations, predictive equations are needed that account for possible genetic effects on the allometric relationships. Our objective was to determine if genetic differences exist in the relationship between LA and DBH in Pinus taeda. We destructively sampled 15-year-old trees of eight families selected to represent either "fast" or "slow" growing genotypes. The regression be tween logarithm of LA and logarithm of DBH was highly significant (r2 = 0.81, p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, the relationship was significantly influ enced by family (p = 0.0045). When analyzed separately, r2 values for individual families ranged from 0.69 to 0.98, with a mean value of 0.86. When the fast growing families were grouped and compared against the slow growing families, growth rate was not found to significantly influence the relationship (p = 0.28). There was greater variability in the slope of the relationship for the faster growing families, but the mean regression relationship did not show any differences between the two groups. Our results clearly indicate that LA-DBH relationships can differ between fam ilies, but these differences do not appear to be related to inherent growth rate.

A web-based educational module illustrating ecological applications of hyperspectral remote sensing. Hyperspectral (narrow-band) remote sensing offers rich opportunities for exploring ecologically significant patterns and processes at a range of spa tial scales. However, access to usable data products is often restricted by the high cost of the tools for analyzing the data and by the enormous time involved in producing useful data products. Additionally, cultural gaps (training and practice-how we "do" science) prevent many ecologists from taking full advantage of remote sensing. With these obstacles in mind, we have developed an interactive web-based module for public access (http:// vcsars.calstatela.edu/hrs). This module includes an introduction to concepts, methods, and applications of hyperspectral remote sensing, an interactive spectral library, and an image library. The interactive tools and sample data can be used to explore ecophysiology, functional vegetation mapping, and analysis of carbon and water vapor fluxes for teaching and research pur poses. Feedback from this project will be used in improving future versions of this module. ROBERTS, J. M. and S. C. HART. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011, USA. Canopy type effects on nitrogen flow in southwestern ponderosa pine forests. Since the late 1800's, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the American Southwest have undergone significant changes due to heavy grazing and fire suppression. The structure of these forests has changed from open, park-like stands of large trees with a diverse and abundant herbaceous understory to dense stands of pole-sized trees and very little understory biomass. A consequence of these human-induced changes in forest structure is increased competition for water and nutrients, which has negatively impacted forest health. Although we know that N availability limits plant growth in these forests, little experimental evidence exists con cerning how changes in forest structure have altered rates of N release from litter and soil organic matter. We assessed the effects of old-growth pine and grass canopy types on inorganic N transformations and decom position at the Camp Navajo Army National Guard base near Flagstaff, AZ. Five plots of each canopy type were randomly selected within four replicated stands. Aerobic laboratory incubations were used to assess can opy effects on soil organic matter quality and N mineralization potential. Initial rates of respiration and maximum respired C were significantly great er under pine canopies. Net N mineralization after the first 7 d and cu mulatively over the 56-d incubation period was also greatest for the pine canopies. Grassy openings, however, had significantly greater nitrification after 7 d, but there were no canopy type differences after 56 d. The ratio of C respired to N mineralized was greatest for pine canopies, indicating a lower soil organic matter quality than in grassy openings. A cellulose filled litterbag method was used to assess decomposition rates of soil or ganic matter. Litterbags were field-incubated for 10 months and analyzed for mass loss and inorganic N content. These results seem to suggest that pine canopies promote N cycling more than grassy openings; however, the relative abundance of these two canopy types will determine stand-level rates of N cycling. ROBERTS, M. R. University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB, Canada. Four-year response of the herbaceous layer to harvesting in a mixed coniferous-deciduous forest. Information concerning the effects of different harvesting systems on the herbaceous layer is scarce. Using 169 5m2 permanent plots established before harvesting, we compared changes in the herbaceous layer (vascular plants &lt;lm tall) in two operational clearcutting treatments (CS = with mechanical site preparation and planting followed by herbicide application in year 3; C = without site preparation, planting or herbicide) to an adjacent uncut control (UC) in a 56-ha watershed in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada. Preharvest tree composition included Betula papyrifera, Acer rub rum, Populus spp., Picea spp. and Abies balsamea. Sixteen species were lost and 35 new species colonized the CS treatment by the fourth year after harvest, compared to 5 and 30 species, respectively, for the C treatment. Richness of forest-dependent species decreased in all three treatments, with the greatest decrease in the CS treatment where higher levels of forest floor disturbance and herbicide occurred. Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') for for est-dependent species decreased over four years after harvest in the CS treatment but increased in the UC and C treatments. Total species richness and H' increased over the four years in all treatments. Unique habitats in the harvest block, including a seepage spring, contained unusual species and high plant diversity. Our results suggest that species diversity of the Oral Presentation Abstracts 187</page><page sequence="149">herbaceous layer could be maintained by minimizing forest floor distur bance, protecting unique habitats and leaving uncut patches within cut blocks.

Plant species richness on the Sho shone National Forest, Wyoming: The continuum and the cosmic pear. Classical plant community diversity research emphasized the distribution of species richness and alpha diversity along direct environmental gradi ents. Current work in community diversity has emphasized productivity, speciation, dispersal, and geomorphic processes as determinants of local species richness. Recently, Austin has emphasized the importance of the continuum concept in diversity research. In response, we analyzed the dis tribution of species richness for 1200 vegetation samples from the Sho shone National Forest, Wyoming, using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination, test ing specific hypothesized determinants of diversity. Plant community rich ness shows a bilaterally-symmetric modal distribution in the NMDS (p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.36). We tested for methodological artifact resulting from a relationship between plot mean similarity to other plots and richness and found a significant but small effect (p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.045); ad justed ordination results were p&lt;0.001 and quasi R2=0.40. The results were inconsistent with the species pool hypothesis (sensu Taylor et al.), with a modal rather than increasing relationship between regional richness and local richness. The relations between richness and three environmental gradients, elevation, moisture, and degree days, were significant but small (p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.014; p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.021; and p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.009 respectively). Incorporating an ecological classification for soil parent material as a categorical variable only increased the NMDS fit a small amount (p&lt;0.001, quasi R2=0.42 vs 0.40). The results suggest plant community richness varies smoothly along a continuum, in agreement with Austin. Tested predictive variables, however, show relatively low explan atory power. ROBERTSON, K. M. and C. K. AUGSPURGER. University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA. Patterns of tree species in early succession along point bars of southeastern USA rivers. During riparian primary succession on point bars, trees often become es tablished at some distance from the channel, where there frequently is a gradient from high to low elevation from the upstream to downstream ends of the point bar. We hypothesized that factors associated with this gradient cause an associated pattern of tree species, and we predicted that succes sional forests on comparable rivers in the southeastern U.S.A. coastal plain would consistently show such a pattern. On each of eight rivers from North Carolina to Texas, ten river bends were surveyed. At each bend, trees of each species in the earliest stage of succession were censused on the point bar at an upstream, middle, and downstream transect, where elevation was measured. Elevation patterns on all rivers corresponded to the expected gradient. On five of the eight rivers, the importance (density + basal area) of more than half of the 11 to 13 common species differed significantly among point bar locations. For each of these species, the relative location on the point bar was the same among rivers. Factors other than elevation may have caused three rivers to deviate from the predicted pattern of tree species. In summary, variables associated with elevation patterns charac terizing the geomorphology of point bars of rivers in the southeast U.S.A. appear to influence the spatial pattern of establishment of a majority of tree species on most of the rivers studied.

Nitrous oxide production, methane oxidation, and soil carbon sequestration in intensive agricul ture: Composite effects on the atmosphere's global warming potential. Agriculture plays a major role in the global fluxes of the greenhouse gases C02, N20, and CH4. Efforts to mitigate the atmosphere's growing global warming potential (GWP) requires knowledge about all three gas fluxes under a variety of management strategies, as well as knowledge about historical fluxes from unmanaged systems. Over an 8-10 year period we measured soil C and N20 and CH4 fluxes in a replicated series of 4 annual cropping systems, 2 perennial cropping systems, and 4 types of unmanaged communities with different successional histories. Soil carbon accumulated in the no-till and organic-based cropping systems (0.03 and 0.01 kg C /m2/ y, respectively), as well as under perennial crops and successional vege tation. Overall fluxes of N20 and CH4 did not differ among annual cropping systems (ca. 3.8 g N20-N Tha/d and -1.8 g CH4-C /ha/d), but N2O produc tion was substantially lower and methane oxidation substantially higher in the unmanaged systems, with average fluxes of -9.4 g CH4-C /ha/d and 1.2 g N20-N /ha/d in the late successional sites. GWP analysis shows that in no-till systems the mitigation potential of soil C sequestration (-110 g CO2 equivalents /m2/y) was halved by the GWP of N20 flux (64 g CO2 equiv alents /m2/y), and halved again by the GWP of N-fertilizer use (27g CO2 equivalents /m2/y). In the low-input and organic systems, C sequestration mitigation potentials (-29 to -40 g CO2 equivalents /m2/y) were completely offset by the GWP of N20 emissions (58-69 g CO2 equivalents /m2/y). CH4 oxidation contributed little to the mitigation of GWP in any of the cropped or early successional systems. High total mitigation potentials of the perennial crops (ca. 110 g CO2 equivalents /m2/y) and the early suc cessional systems (-211 g CO2 equivalents /m2/y) were due in part to rel atively low N20 fluxes. The development of mitigation strategies based on ecosystem management need to include considerations of changes in N20 and CH4 fluxes in addition to changes in C storage. ROBLES, C. D.,' K. B.

Differential settlement of the mussels Mytilus californianus and M. trossulus in sheltered on exposed and sheltered rocky shores.. Sympatric species of adult mytilid mussels play important, but markedly different roles in wave-exposed vs. sheltered rocky shore communities. However, the relative settlement of these species in relation to wave ex posure has not been examined. We set out two types of mussel spat col lectors (boards covered by either nylon scrub pads or adult Mytilus cali fornianus) on two midshore levels (7 and 9 ft. NLLW) at wave-exposed and sheltered rocky shores in Barkley Sound, British Columbia. Relative to exposed sites, very few M. californianus settled in sheltered sites, re gardless of collector type; Mytilus trossulus settled in abundance in both wave exposures. These results are consistent with recent speculation about the life history "strategies" of Mytilus spp.. Contrary to another post set tlement competition hypothesis, it may be the lack of M. californianus settlement that drives the relative numerical dominance of M. trossulus in sheltered areas.

The physiological response to changes in pO2 in reptiles has been ambig uous. Very little is known about the physiological consequences of oxygen concentrations on free-ranging animals. Ambient levels of PO2 may in part, explain variation in locomotor performance. Further, acclimation to PO2 levels between populations of a species whose distribution spans a large elevational gradient may be exhibited in whole body physiological respons es, i.e., endurance. Previously, I detected significant variation in endurance capacity in Sceloporus graciosus from 2460-m when evaluated across a 2200-m range. In addition, there was no response in S. occidentalis from 1460-m across this same range. Further, when acclimated to lower eleva tions, S. graciosus demonstrated significantly longer endurance capacities with concurrent significant decreases in hematocrit. The current study was conducted on two populations of S. scalaris in southeastern AZ. High and low elevation populations were sampled from the Chiricahua Mountains (2700-in) and Empire Valley (1375-in), respectively. Initial endurance ca pacity and hematocrit was determined at the resident elevation. Individuals were reciprocally transplanted at each elevation and maintained for 5 weeks during which endurance capacity was measured weekly. Final hematocrit and resident endurance was again measured at the end of the experiment. Concurrently, samples from each elevation were evaluated for endurance capacity at resident and reciprocal elevations immediately upon capture. Significant differences in endurance capacity existed between populations; however, no differences were detected within a population at reciprocal 188 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="150">elevations. Both populations demonstrated significant acclimation to recip rocal elevations after 4 weeks. Interestingly, this response did not persist in high elevation lizards returned to their resident elevation but did in low elevation lizards. Both demonstrated significant decreases in hematocrit.

Physiological and morphological responses of three Nothofa gus species to UV-B radiation resulting from Antarctic ozone depletion in Tierra del Fuego, southern South America. The extensive forests of southern South America, in particular those of Tierra del Fuego, are comprised almost exclusively of three Nothofagus species. The Antarctic ozone depletion known since the early 1980's, cur rently causes Tierra del Fuego to receive more UV-B radiation during the Austral Spring (Sept-Dec) than it has over the estimable past. This research aims to elucidate the mechanism by which Nothofagus species respond to this unprecedented change in their light environment. Plastic filters were used to regulate UV-B radiation, to near-ambient UV-B and attenuated UV B radiation. Appropriate branch filter structures were developed, to allow branches under different light regimes on the same tree to be compared whilst minimising resultant stress and perturbation of growth. These filters were installed before bud-swelling, and branches were monitored through out the growing season in trees of each of the closely related species, the deciduous Nothofagus antarctica, N. pumilio and the evergreen N. betu loides , near Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. This allowed the different patterns and timing of growth in these species to be contrasted. Measurements of leaf physiology and morphology were carried out. Rates of leaf expansion were compared, by fitting leaf measurements repeated in time over the course of expansion to a piece-wise linear polynomial equation. Final leaf size was not shown to be significantly affected by UV-B radiation. Con centration of UV-B absorbing compounds, and leaf thickness were both observed to increase in response to near-ambient levels of UV-B radiation. The seasonal changes in parameters such as stem elongation; leaf devel opment; and branching frequency under the two treatments, did not show a distinct trend with altered UV-B radiation flux. These findings relate to other work being done on the effects of UV-B radiation on the natural ecosystems of Tierra del Fuego, and interactions between Nothofagus and associated organisms. The results have the potential to indicate how in creased UV-B radiation could affect competition between the three co existing Nothofagus species, if extrapolated over many years of increased UV-B exposure.

Exotic herbivores facilitate the near extinction of an in sular mesopredator. Top-down processes influence community dynamics and structure, but their influence is often dampened by the vast array of interactions that occur among trophic levels. Trophic cascades are more common in simple sys tems where perturbations, like the introduction of a novel predator, have a more profound impact. Here we show that anthropogenic disturbance to the California Channel Islands caused a shift in the apex predator, from island fox to golden eagle, which changed the trophic hierarchy from a 3 level to a 4-level system. Golden eagles have subsequently caused the near extirpation of three subspecies of the island fox, a rare island endemic. Fox populations have declined by 90% and have an estimated 50% chance of persistence over the next decade. Of 28 fox carcasses discovered on two islands, 24 (86%) showed signs of being eaten by a large raptor, 18 (64%) had talon holes in the head or body, and 8 (29%) had golden eagle feathers nearby. The discovery of the first golden eagle nest ever recorded for the Channel Islands confirms recent colonization. A predator-prey logistic model supports the premise that mainland golden eagles were attracted to the archipelago and sustained by the presence of a novel prey, feral pigs. Regression analyses suggest that an increase in the abundance of the island spotted skunk, a competitor of the island fox, is also related to the decline in foxes. ROGERS, W. E. and E. SIEMANN.

The alien tree, Chinese tallow, Sapium sebiferum, is a major invader which threatens the biotic integrity of a variety of ecosystems throughout the southeastern United States. We conducted a pot experiment examining the interactive effects of three levels of light, three levels of nitrogen, and three levels of simulated herbivory on the growth of Chinese tallow and Hack berry, Celtis laevigata, a native tree species. As we predicted, Chinese tallow and Hackberry tree seedlings were able to thrive under a variety of light and nitrogen conditions, but Chinese tallow stem diameter and plant mass were significantly larger than Hackberry in all of the resource com binations. Our prediction that Chinese tallow would lack tolerance of leaf defoliation, despite being resistant to herbivory in the United States, was not supported. Like Hackberry, which is regularly damaged by folivorous herbivores, Chinese tallow showed significant tolerance and compensatory regrowth following leaf defoliation. Combined these findings suggest that Chinese tallow is an "herbivore tolerant" plant that is currently reaping the benefits of a "herbivore resistant" plant without the associated costs. Great er morphological and physiological plasticity coupled with a current release from top-down herbivore regulation likely account for the marked success of Chinese tallow as an invasive tree.

Cumulative impacts of two superfund sites and urban development upon a small watershed's streams. Cumulative impacts of physical habitat degradation and metal contamina tion upon fish and aquatic macroinvertebrates were evaluated using spatial associations of potential cause and effect. The study area is a small water shed in Massachusetts that contains two Superfund sites and a mix of residential, commercial and industrial land uses. Sixteen sites in this wa tershed and four ecoregional reference sites were assessed. The predicted relationships of physical habitat degradation and contamination to biolog ical impairment were observed. As expected, these relationships were only apparent when both chemical and physical stressors were considered. This result suggests the potential importance of including habitat assessment in field studies of contaminant impacts. For the evaluation of impacts upon fish, the number of native fish species caught (by electroshocking) at a site was used as the measure of biological condition, and habitat condition was a simple function of stream depth and instream cover score. As predicted, the biological condition of fish assemblages from minimally-contaminated sites varied from good to poor as habitat condition varied from good to poor. Biological degradation beyond that attributable to habitat degradation alone was observed at contaminated sites. Twelve benthic metrics were used to characterize the biological condition of macroinvertebrate assem blages and to relate biological impairment to chemical and physical deg radation (using linear regression and t-tests comparing site categories). Similar levels of biological impairment were observed at sites with severe physical or chemical degradation, or moderate chemical and physical deg radation. Individual benthic metrics were not diagnostic of impairment type. An aggregate macroinvertebrate index was developed that was more sensitive to chemical and physical degradation than any individual metric, illustrating the strength of a multimetric approach for detecting the cu mulative impacts of physical habitat degradation and chemical contami nation.

We present empirical models describing relationships between to pography and re-burned areas in two, regionally distinct wilderness areas: the 226,455-ha Gila Wilderness Area, New Mexico and the 546,627-ha Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area, Idaho/Montana. We used continuous surface models for elevation (digital elevation models) and derived slope and aspect data to predict areas burned two or more times during the 20th century. We used likelihood ratio tests, logistic regression, and classifica tion and regression trees (CART) to investigate associations between to pography and area burned multiple times in each wilderness area. Our emphasis was to develop models based on easily obtained (or derived) topographic information, along with spatially and temporally continuous fire perimeter data for the 20th century to develop probability surfaces for use in future ecological and operational wilderness management planning. Results indicated that slope and aspect subordinated to elevation in our models. Coefficients for elevation, slope, and aspect were obtained using logistic regression, but standard logistic regression models failed to identify non-monotonic relationships between fire frequency and topography. CART models were simple, with bifurcations defined by elevation. While CART models correctly classified non-monotonic relationships between el evation and fire frequency, slope, and aspect had no overall effect until cluster membership was too low to affect the overall model. While statis tical significance of our logistic regression models and CART models was limited, the overall trends and patterns represented by the models indicate that important inferences about fire frequency may be determined using simple derivatives of digital elevation models.

The effect of habitat and behavior on burrow structure of two species of pocket gopher. In many animal species, the densities and abundances of individuals are determined by (1) resource abundance, (2) body size, and (3) social inter actions. Subterranean animals should be particularly affected by resources and body size because of their energetically expensive lifestyle. For ex ample, the cost of constructing burrows for pocket gophers is 360-3400 times as costly as moving on the surface. The energetic expense is highly variable and dependent on soil characteristics and body size, but less is known about the influence of social interactions. Existing data for a single species suggest that pocket gophers maintain uniform between-burrow spacing as well as within-burrow geometry across wide ranges of resource and habitat features. This consistency implies that burrow spatial patterns may be mediated through social interactions. To test this hypothesis, we examined physical characteristics of previously excavated burrow systems distributed across sites in Arizona, Kansas, and Minnesota. The burrows were constructed by two species of gopher (Thomomys bottae and Geomys bursarius) that differ greatly in body size. To determine burrow configu rations, we measured several metrics of burrow geometry such as total burrow length and branching angles. We found few differences among bur row systems of the two species across locations. This finding supports the suggestion that gophers maintain burrow features independent of habitat and species characteristics. ROMEY, W. L. and C.

Competition and soil moisture influence the distribution of the endangered Coral Pink Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle (Cicindela limbata albissima). The Coral Pink Sand Dunes Tiger Beetle (Cicindela limbata albissima) occupies one of the smallest home ranges of any species. It exists only within a 0.75 km2 area in the southernmost part of Utah in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. It is currently a candidate species for listing as an endangered species. In this study we examined potential niche differences between C.l. albissima and another co-occurring species of tiger beetle (C. tranquebarica). In June 1999 we counted adult numbers of each species and measured percent soil moisture and temperature in 45 interdunal swales where one or both species occur. Results showed a significant correlation between the average percent soil moisture of a swale and the ratio of the number of the two species of tiger beetle (regression analysis r2 = 0.384, p K 0.001). In swales with less than 4% moisture there were more C.!. albissima. It is not yet clear whether the observed relationship has to do with preferences of the adult for a foraging / oviposition area or the ability of C.l. albissima larvae to tolerate the drier dune swales.

An alternative method for estimating above-ground production in mangrove com munities of Biscayne National Park, Florida. Total above-ground production of forest communities is usually estimated through a combination of allometry and litter collection. However, in coast al sites that are tidally influenced, or in juvenile or dwarf forests where the crown bases of dominant individuals may begin within a few decimeters of ground level, estimates of leaf production that depend on litter collection may not be feasible. We therefore developed an alternative method of es timating production in mangrove forests that overcomes this limitation. The method incorporates (a) detailed censuses of all individuals within fixed sampling plots, with (b) periodic observations of marked leaf cohorts, and is an adaptation of techniques more commonly used in grasslands. We applied the method in two South Florida forests: A fringe mangrove forest in the early stages of recovery from Hurricane Andrew (August 1992), and a dwarf forest which was not substantially damaged by the storm. During 1996-98, total above-ground production in the fringe forest was about 3 times higher than dwarf forest production. Moreover, when compared to the dwarf forest, fringe production rates were approximately eight, six, six, and two times as high as dwarf forest rates for proproots, branches, stems, and leaves, respectively. Calculations of leaf production were based on mean Rhizophora mangle leaf longevities that ranged from six to nine months, depending on cohort and site. Analysis of variance indicated that leaf life spans did not differ significantly between dwarf and fringe forests, but did differ among leaf cohorts. Based on reported values for similar mangrove forests, the method provided reasonable estimates of above ground production of different tissues, while furnishing relevant auxiliary information on spatial and temporal variation in leaf demographic patterns.

We have completed three years of a project to incorporate problem-based mathematical modeling into introductory and advanced biology laboratory exercises. We chose island biogeography theory because it spans several ecological concepts and is easily modeled using basic algebra. In the class. room, we first use concept mapping to explain relationships between and among variables determining insular species number. Outdoors, students simulate island theory by throwing discs ("species") at small(0.25m2) and large (0.50m2) quadrats ("islands") placed near to (2m) and far from (4m) a source population. Students record resident species number, abundance, and immigration and extinction events over 10, 15-s colonization events. Students perform three replicates. The model we develop uses these data to predict the equilibrium number of island species (S). Island area (A) and S estimates may also be used to estimate constants of a well-known spe cies-area model (S=cAz). We used pre- and post-testing as a measurement tool to assess student learning (n=32) of three relevant categories of quan titative problem-solving skills. Our evaluations show a mean relative test score improvement of 44.5% (P &lt; 0.0001) as well as significant increases in each skill (range 0.006 &lt; P &lt; 0.01). We think combining cognitive teaching strategies with problem-based mathematical modeling methods can enhance student understanding and application of biological concepts. We discuss student and teacher attitudes. RUBINO, D. L. and B. C. MCCARTHY. Ohio University, Athens, OH. Dendrochronological analysis of white oak (Quercus alba L.) growing across a topographic moisture gradient in southern Ohio. Annual tree growth represents an aggregate response to biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding how these factors influence radial growth patterns is a major objective of dendrochronological studies. In this investigation we wanted to identify and compare growth trends of white oak (Quercus alba L.) growing across a moisture gradient, measured as an integrated moisture index (IMI), in southern Ohio. The IMI is a computer-generated, 190 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="152">GIS model that combines edaphic and topographic features into a com posite moisture-availability scale. Additionally, we wanted to determine the influence of climate on radial growth patterns across IMI. Using orthogonal polynomials, we performed radial-growth trend analysis among IMI classes (xeric, intermediate, and mesic) and found growth trends in mesic sites to be significantly greater than those in xeric sites (ANOVA; P = 0.02). Ad ditional climatic analyses found annual growth increments to be signifi cantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated with monthly drought severity, precipitation, and temperature. In xeric and intermediate sites, larger correlation coeffi cients and a greater number of significant correlations between climatic parameters and annual growth were observed than in mesic sites. These results suggest that radial-growth rates may track climate more closely on sites that are topographically moisture-limited. Growth rates during years of drought and high precipitation also differed significantly across IMI, but no consistent pattern was noted among the different IMI classes. We hy pothesize that radial growth and IMI may be loosely associated, but the climate by IMI interaction may have a greater influence on radial growth rates than IMI or climate alone.

Measure of simultaneous tree sways and estimation of crown interactions among a group of trees. We present a technique to measure the simultaneous sway of a group of trees to study the frequency of crown collisions and sway dynamics of individual trees or groups of trees. We placed biaxial clinometers (tiltme ters) at the live crown base in a cluster of ten 15m tall Lodgepole Pine trees near Whitecourt Alberta, Canada. Tree bole rotation at tiltmeter mount height was recorded during windy conditions at a rate of 10 times per second for the cluster of trees. Rotation angles were used in a bole curve shape calculation to estimate tree displacement in 2-dimensional space. Collision reconstruction was done in Arc/Info by assigning asymmetrical crown area dimensions to calculated displacement for each tree. Recon structions for each time step measures any overlaps between crown areas and outputs the results. Crown overlaps estimated in this manner allow assessment of collision frequencies, area of crown overlap during colli sions, and which other trees a subject tree is interacting with. Fifteen min utes of data with an average wind speed of 4.5 m/s, and maximum of 10.0 m/s were processed for an average of 528 collisions and an average col lision area of 0.28m2. This frequency and depth of collisions supports the notion that wind induced crown interaction inhibits lateral shoot extension and is the dominant mechanism for crown asymmetry and crown shyness. This insight into dynamic crown interactions will allow estimation of and cultivation of forest stand structural attributes that are resistant to damage from wind. RUETH, H. M. and W. J. PARTON.'

Field survey results of twelve similar old-growth Englemann spruce stands suggest that current levels of N deposition are altering forest biogeochem istry on the east side of the Colorado Front Ratige. It is difficult in surveys to control potentially confounding factors. CENTURY, a biogeochemical cycling model, was used to address whether elevated N deposition can explain observed differences in N pools and cycling rates between high and low N deposition sites. Increased N inputs should decrease soil organic matter (SOM) C:N and foliar C:N, and increase net primary production, mineralization rates and inorganic N loss. The active and slow SOM C:N decreased following N additions and the passive SOM pool was unrespon sive. Simulated results captured the observed differences in foliar C:N. Nitrogen additions increased fine root and leaf production and N, which accounted for a majority of the increase in total production and total live biomass N. N mineralization rates and inorganic N loss increased with elevated N inputs. The rapid response of this simulated forest system to N additions indicates it was N limited. This simulation supports our conclu sions from field results, that the observed differences between high and low N deposition sites can be attributed to differences in N inputs. RUFFNER, C.

Disturbance history and stand dynamics along a topographic gradient in old-growth hemlock-northern hardwood for ests of the Allegheny Plateau, USA. Dendroecology and stand structure analysis were used to investigate how disturbance parameters vary across contrasting sites and how species re spond to variable disturbance regimes in the Tionesta Research Natural Area on the Allegheny Plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania. Disturbance chronologies based on radial growth analysis were developed for upland, sideslope, and riparian sites to understand how these disturbances influence stand structure and long-term recruitment patterns. Exogenous disturbances such as tornades, glaze storms, and thunderstorm downbursts affect the region several times each century creating widespread pit-mound topog raphy, large gaps, and uni-directional blowdowns. However, disturbance intensity was directly related to site elevation and exposure, decreasing from the upland to riparian sites. Upland sites (stand age approximately 300 years) experienced medium intensity disturbances (20% canopy dam age) nearly every 30 years with four decades exhibiting heavy disturbances (40% canopy damage) resulting in higher importance of early succession taxa across these sites. Sideslope sites experienced medium intensity dis turbances every decade with only one heavy intensity disturbance while the riparian site was impacted by medium intensity disturbances every 80 years with no heavy disturbances in the last 350 years. The reduced dis turbance frequency of the lower elevation sites was largely responsible for the dominance of these sites by later successional hemlock and beech. Previous estimates based on witness tree line data suggesting disturbance rotations of 1000-2000 years for these forests appear too long. Based on tree-ring data, we suggest that medium intensity disturbances impact the Allegheny Plateau every 210-630 years. This discrepancy between historic data and tree-ring data suggest that disturbance intervals estimated from historical sources may be too long, inaccurately portraying the pre-Euro pean disturbance regime. RUIZ, P. L. and M. S. ROSS. Florida International University, Miami, FL 33199 USA. The status of four endemic pine rockland herbs in the Florida Keys: Implication for long term management. The abundance, distribution and status of four endemic pine rockland herbs (Chamecrista lineata var. keyensis, Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. serpyllum, Melanthera parvifolia , and Linum arenicola) were examined in the Florida Keys. Though populations of M. parvifolia and L. arenicola exist on the South Florida mainland, no populations of C. lineata or C. deltoidea ssp. serpyllum occur outside the pine rockland forests of the Florida Keys. Thus, their status within this isolated and restricted geographical range is of con cern to conservation efforts, considering that pine rockland forests are a globally endangered plant community. Our study, thus, focused on five neighboring islands in the Lower Keys that have substantial pine rockland forests remaining. Sampling transects were established with evenly placed points (ca. 50 meters apart). At each point the density of each herb was recorded along with other plot variables. From this data we derived 16 habitat variables and created a fire history for each transect/point based on aerial photographs, fire records, and personal accounts. We then applied a principal component analysis to the habitat and fire history variables and thus reduced the data to four easily-interpretable composite factors. Our census revealed that the four herb species are restricted to one key (Big Pine Key). However, our analysis suggested that appropriate habitat is pre sent on the other four islands (Little Pine Key, No Name Key, Sugarloaf and Cudjoe Keys), though such sites are less abundant than on Big Pine Key. We conclude from this that habitat and short term management prac tices are not limiting factors in the distribution of these species. Further more, the reestablishment of these herbs requires management strategies which integrate species reintroduction with effective fire management. However, we believe that long term sea level rise, through its direct (i.e. salt water intrusion) and indirect effects (i.e. fragmentation of once contin uous pine rockland forest), is the fundamental factor controlling the status and vigor of these species on these islands.

The effect of windthrow distur bance and salvage logging on nitrogen cycling in a coniferous forest ecosystem. The biogeochemical effects of windthrow disturbance have been studied in tropical and temperate deciduous forests, but have not been studied in tem perate coniferous forests. Furthermore, previous studies have produced somewhat conflicting results. This study examines the short-term effects of windthrow disturbance and subsequent salvage logging activities on soil physical and chemical properties and on nitrogen mineralization in a co niferous forest. The study location is Routt National Forest, which sus tained a large(&gt; 8,000 hectares)windthrow disturbance in October 1997. Experimental plots were installed in August 1999 in areas of intact forest, areas of blowdown forest and in recently salvage-logged areas. Soil phys ical and chemical properties were measured in these three treatment types, and nitrogen mineralization rates were calculated using the in-situ buried bag method for August through November. The first-year results of this three-year study established that soil physical and chemical properties do not differ significantly between areas of intact forest and areas of blowdown forest. Control and blowdown treatment values for percent soil organic matter were 35 +5%, and 25 ?'10%, respectively and depth of the organic horizon was 4 ?0.5 cm and 4 +0.6 cm, respectively. Soil moisture did differ between the control and blowdown treatments (123 + 7g of H20/g of dry soil for control plots and 107 ?5g of H20/g of dry soil for blow down plots). However, recently logged sites were significantly drier, and were nearly uniformly lacking an organic horizon. Consequently, there were significant differences in the percent soil organic matter (4 +0.5%), depth of the organic horizon (0 cm), and soil moisture (39 +3g of H20/g of dry soil) between logged areas relative to blowdown and intact forest areas. Differences in nitrogen mineralization rates, and C: N ratios were also observed. These results indicate that in the short-term, alterations to soil properties and nitrogen mineralization rates are more pronounced as a result of salvage logging activities than from large-scale windthrow distur bance.

Low leaf-specific conductivity reduces stomatal conductance and photosyn thesis in older, taller mountain beech trees. Decreased photosynthesis in taller trees may limit carbon gain and slow height growth. Lower photosynthesis in older, taller trees may result from lower hydraulic conductivity or photosynthetic capacity. We measured pho tosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and leaf water potential in the upper canopy of adjacent 3 m (-30-yr) and 15 m (- 150-yr) mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodiodes) in New Zealand. Leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity in the 15-m trees was 70% of the 3-m trees, and the differences did not change throughout the day. Stomatal conductance and photosynthesis were more sensitive to saturation vapor-pressure deficit in the 15-m trees, and photosynthetic capacity was lower in the 15-m trees. Discrimination of "3C was about 2%o greater in foliage of the upper canopy of 3-m trees, and 1.5%o greater in the wood at 1.4 m. We found similar differences in 13C isotope discrimination between short and tall trees in 5 other locations. These results suggest that canopy-level hydraulic conduc tance is less for taller mountain beech resulting in lower canopy assimi lation. SAAH, D., T. BENNING and L. FORTMANN.

Documenting the impacts of chang ing land use and land holding trends on vegetation patterns in the California Sierra Nevada using a geographic information system (GIS). A geographic information system (GIS) was developed to record and an alyze changes in land use, land holding patterns and forest cover in the Sierra Nevada of California. The Placer County sub-region of the Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program (IHRMP) in the central Sierra Ne vada was the study area. Vegetation and parcel base GIS coverages created for 1957 and 1998 were examined and compared to determine change in forest cover, landholding and land use. This was accomplished by system atic transect sampling, which was spatially analyzed in the GIS. Two pat terns emerged based on high and low elevation. 1) The high elevations can be generalized as having a net increase in forest cover on consolidated parcels with a notable increase in stand density between the two time points. Overall, there was a shift in forest cover from the lower to higher elevations. Forest cover patches in the higher elevations were more uniform and had larger extents. Parcel concentration followed the same polarizing trend, with land in the high elevations becoming more consolidated and low elevation more fragmented. Federal government land holdings, which are predominantly found in the higher elevations, have increased by 13.5% from 1957 to 54% of the total study area. There has been an observed net increase of forest cover on federal lands. Parcels classified as timberland have also been historically found in the higher elevations. The majority of 1998 parcels classified as timberland have been consolidated into fewer larger holdings, with a total net decrease in area of 35% from 1957. 2) The lower elevations can be generalized as fragmented both in parcel size and forest cover. This may be due to the increase in residential developments in the foothills as well as improvements to the major transportation corri dors. Observed forest cover densities in the low elevations have increased but the average extent of each patch has decreased. Finally, local owners controlled relatively the same percentage of land between the two time periods (19.1% in 1957, 18.29% in 1998). There was a shift of absentee owners from the San Francisco Bay Area (-14.49% of the total study area from 1957 to 1998) to other parts of California (+5.42% in Southern Cal ifornia, +5.32% in the Northern Interior).

Reproductive response of Delphinium nelsonii (Ranunculaceae) to a subalpine climate warming experiment. High altitude and high latitude sites are expected to be very sensitive to global warming. Long term studies in a subalpine meadow of the Colorado Rocky Mountains showed a strong correlation between snow pack and Delphinium nelsonii flower production, and predicted that global warming might have a negative fitness effect on D. nelsonii and other early flowering species. In this article we report an experimental study of the effects of global warming on the density and flower production of Delphinium nel sonii. We found that experimental warming has a negative effect on D. nelsonii flower production, supporting earlier predictions. D. nelsonii plants responded to the warming through a reduced density of flowering plants and by having fewer flowers per plant in the heated plots compared to the controls. Flower bud abortion was higher in the heated plots than the nat ural controls only in 1994, a year with especially low snow accumulation. These results contrast with others for the same species in a snow removal experiment. Snow removal did not consistently affect D. nelsonii fitness (e.g., flower number per plant), suggesting that other factors than snow cover, such as temperature or soil moisture, are likely to be more important in modulating the response of D. nelsonii to snow pack. Our results suggest that global warming may affect the abundance of D. nelsonii and similar early flowering species in high altitude sites, affecting pollinators and plants that depend on them.

We constructed stage-based matrix models of 25 bird species and related their predicted responses to stress to their life history traits. All species were modeled using up to eight life stages and a minimum of a weekly time step. Stage-specific survival, reproduction, and growth rates reported in the literature were used to tailor the model to the biology of each species. Density-dependence and interannual stochasticity were imposed on various combinations of life stages for each species. Life history traits of the 25 species were also recorded and clustering statistical methods were applied to identify major life history strategies. Multiple 200-year simulations were performed under baseline (stable conditions) and under stressed conditions, simulated by mortality increases for each life stage individually and all life stages simultaneously. Predicted long-term average population abundance was compared between baseline and stressed simulations. The magnitudes of predicted responses were correlated with the life stage stressed and life history traits such as longevity, degree of parental care, and the life stage 192 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="154">ini which density-dependence occurred.

Ecologists have long debated whether stochastic or biological forces drive community assembly. There are at least 13 different models that explain the assembly process and the resulting species abundance curves. I have made two observations: 1) All samples of communities that I have tested have asymptotic decay rates when plotted against the number of species in a community, and the range of variation has a distinct pattern; 2) 36 to 78% of all samples in a variety of community types have either a Negative Exponential (NE) or a Modified Zipf-Mandelbrot (MZM) distribution. I built a model to attempt to resolve these observations and to incorporate the stochastic and biological forces that have been described and supported to date. This model, now incorporated into a computer simulator called Eco-Assembler, includes a complex set of algorithms (using fuzzy logic and multiple layers of interaction) that incorporate community resources, habitat space, competition, dispersal ability, facilitation, inhibition, matrix dispersal rate, reproduction, disturbance, sensitivity to disturbance, mortal ity, and degradation of the matrix. I used actual species abundances from communities I had sampled to initiate the model, and then compared the model results to actual samples from those same communities. I found that the best fit of the abundance distributions agreed in type frequency (average r = 0.84) and consistency of residual values (average r = 0.81). In addition, the communities demonstrated the asymptotic decay curves. I then sought to determine whether the model could be simplified and still obtain the same results. I hypothesized that the interaction of the high number of complex processes in the model would reduce to simple overall processes. I was able to simplify the model and show not only the asymptotic decay curves and the prevalence of the NE and MZM distributions, but an inter esting alternation from sample to sample between these two distributions as well. It appears that the complexity of community assembly can be reduced to a few simple rules governed by simple additive and subtractive neighborhood interactions based on stochastic juxtaposition of species dur ing the invasion process, with community resources and differentiation of habitat space as limiting factors.

Reproductive compensation by wild carrot, Daucus carota: The inter action of plant competition and mammalian herbivory. Over two growing seasons we tested the hypothesis that there is a contin uum of reproductive response by plants exposed to herbivory based on the competitive environment where plants grow, from negative responses to herbivory in competitive environments to overcompensatory responses in low competition environments. We experimentally studied the reproductive response of wild carrot, Daucus carota, to grazing by white tailed deer, Odocoileus virginiana, under conditions of ambient and reduced interspe cific plant competition. In a fully crossed experimental design, wild carrot plants growing in an abandoned agricultural field were assigned to a re duced competition or a competition-present treatment and plants were ei ther clipped to simulate deer herbivory or were left unclipped; plants were protected from subsequent herbivory using mesh cages. Over two summers that differed in the abundance and distribution of natural precipitation, wild carrot plants that were clipped exhibited a compensatory reproductive re sponse and produced mature umbels that were comparable in size to those on intact, unclipped plants regardless of competitive environment in which they grew. Clipped plants produced a similar number of umbels compared with unclipped plants. Competition effects were not apparent, with plants in the low and high competition environments producing similar sizes and numbers of umbels. We conclude that for wild carrot, under the environ mental conditions influencing the population we studied, there was no ev idence for a continuum of response to grazing by deer. Further, plants grazed by deer exhibited reproductive compensation but suffered neither apparent reproductive loss nor evidence for reproductive overcompensa tion. SAFFORD, H. D. and S. P. HARRISON.

We compared the native and alien species composition of ungrazed road side verges with that of adjacent grazed interiors in the grasslands of Cal ifornia's inner northern coast range (Napa and Lake Counties). We sampled 72 pairs of verge and interior quadrats at 5 sites representative of the re gion's grasslands, on both fertile (loam) and infertile (serpentine) soils, avoiding all obvious forms of roadside physical disturbance. We found that on serpentine soils, ungrazed verges had a higher proportion of alien spe cies than grazed interiors; on nonserpentine soils, the reverse was true. Within serpentine soils, native species were more prevalent in quadrats with lower biomass; within nonserpentine, natives were more prevalent in quad rats receiving less radiation. Overall, the total species diversity was higher in grazed interiors than on ungrazed verges, regardless of the fertility of the substrate. Our results indicate that the ecological role of roadside verges depends on the interactive effects of community composition and history, environmental gradients, and land use practices that characterize a region.

A long and widely held belief in biogeography is that a species' abundance should be greatest at the center of its range and decline in abundance toward the edges, which have uniformly low abundance. Many biogeog raphy texts have described this "abundant center" distribution and it has even been called a "general rule" of biogeography. This distributional pat tern has been taken as a given condition in discussions of higher order ecological theories including species' responses to climate change, popu lation dynamics, the designation of habitat reserves, pest outbreaks, and genetic population structure. Yet there have been surprisingly few empirical studies aimed at illustrating this pattern in nature, and fewer still which conclude that the pattern exists. We review these studies and find that many are biased towards finding the abundant center pattern because they fail to appreciate the problems in presenting a two-dimensional pattern (abun dance across a range area) in one-dimensional space (abundance vs. dis tance from the center or edge). We propose that marine intertidal species along the western coast of North America represent an ideal system for examining the abundant center distribution as their ranges can essentially be defined in one-dimensional space. We present results of population sur veys of several intertidal invertebrate and plant species conducted over the entire range of the species. These surveys show that an abundant center pattern is not a universal feature of intertidal species' abundance distribu tions and that the primary signal is of extreme site-to-site variation in abundance. The results suggest that broad generalizations need to be tested before they are applied blindly to management situations. SAGE, R. F and T L. SAGE. University of Toronto, ON M5S3B2 Canada. Microsite characteristics of the C4 grass, Muhlenbergia richardsonis, in the alpine zone of the White Mountains, California. C4 plants are uncommon in cold environments at high latitude and altitude, and are not generally thought to occur in the alpine tundra. In the White Mountains of California, we have observed that the C4 grass, Muhlenbergia richardsonis, commonly occurs in the alpine zone at 3300 to 3800 m, with the highest population observed at 3950 m above sea level (13,000 feet). This is the highest reported C4 plant population in North America, and is near the world altitude limits (4000 to 4200 m) reported for C4 plants in central Asia and the Andes. At its highest distribution (3600 to 3950 m), M. richardsonis is restricted to southeast and southwest facing slopes, with greatest frequency on southeast faces. M. richardsonis plants form low mats with mean height of 2.7 cm, while co-occurring C3 grasses form bunches that are on average two to three times taller. As a result, M. ri chardsonis leaves are more affected by the boundary layer of the soil than nearby C3 grasses. Temperature of M. richardsonis leaves was over 30?C above air temperature in full sun and still air, and 20?C above air temper ature in full sun and wind. As a result, middaiy leaf temperatures in M. richardsonis were routinely observed to be 25?C to 35?C, conditions fa Oral Presentation Abstracts 193</page><page sequence="155">vorable to C4 photosynthesis. At night, the high boundary layer in the Muhlenbergia mats allows for 50 to 15?C reduction of leaf temperature below air temperature, resulting in regular frosting of leaves. These results indicate that M. richardsonis requires daytime heating for ecological suc cess, and has evolved the capacity for freezing tolerance at night and early in the day. The ability to withstand regular freezing suggests that minimum daily temperature alone cannot account for the general absence of the C4 pathway in cold environments. Instead, a feature associated with the day time heat requirement of the C4 pathway may be more important. SAHA, S. University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago 60607-7060. Fire behavior and impact of fire on tree juvenile growth and mortality in a dry deciduous forest of central India. Throughout the lowlands of tropical Asia, anthropogenic fires are frequent and widespread. Dry deciduous forests that make up for more than 50% of the total forest area in India, burn annually with fires of low-intensity (ground fires). This is the first study that documented response of plants to experimental fire treatments in Indian deciduous forests. The response of juvenile trees to fire and fire-exclusion in a dry deciduous forest of central India were monitored during 1999. Surface temperatures during the fire and duration of burning were the fire behavior traits recorded during the study. Twenty-one 9 m2 plots were established to test for the effects of simulated burn treatments that mimic the anthropogenic fire regime. The impact of three experimental treatments, early burn (in mid March), late burn (in April) and fire exclusion, were documented on tree juveniles up to 1.5 m in height. Height and stem diameter of all individuals in February 99 (pre-treatment) and early July (post-treatment) were recorded. Fire caused 66 % stem die-back in the burn plots compared to the 25% in the fire-exclusion plots. Fire-exclusion plots suffered stem die-back due to se vere drought that is characteristic of sub-tropical monsoon forests of India. Significant difference in mortality between the three treatments was found, with plots burned in March showing the greatest mortality (.2= 7.52, P &lt; 0.05). Post-treatment height was greater in fire-exclusion plots than the burned plots (F = 46.595, P &lt; 0.01). Sexual species suffered greater mor tality than clonal tree species. These results suggest that fire may cause stunting of forests by reducing juvenile growth, and the abundance of clon al tree species may increase due to repeated fires. SALA, A.,l E. V.

Water transport in large northern Rocky Moun tain conifers is not always limited. Evidence suggests that as trees grow older and larger, hydraulic conduc tance decreases causing stomatal closure and low photosynthesis rates. This "hydraulic limitation hypothesis" has been proposed as one of the mecha nisms responsible for the decline of productivity of old trees and forests. If water transport becomes limited in large trees, then leaf area-based whole-tree water use should decline with tree size. We tested this hypoth esis for two pairs of Rocky Mountain conifers: whitebark pine (Pinus al bicaulis) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) in the subalpine zone, and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western larch (Larix occidentalis) in low elevation forests of western Montana during July 1996. We mea sured whole tree water use with sapflow techniques in 9-20 trees of dif ferent sizes of the four species. At the end of the season we harvested all trees to measure biomass allocation and leaf area. Daily integrated sapflow on a leaf area basis declined significantly with tree size for whitebark pine (r2 = 0.46, p = 0.03) and western larch (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.02) but not for subalpine fir and Douglas-fir. Decreased leaf area-based sapflow for large pines and larches were related to significant increases of leaf to sapwood area ratios as tree size increased. Constant leaf area-based sap flux densities with tree size in firs were related to either constant or decreasing leaf to sapwood area ratios as trees grew larger. Our results for the two firs indicate that water supply to foliage does not always become limited as trees in crease in size. They also indicate that water transport capacity of trees of different sizes is related to their corresponding leaf to sapwood ratios. SALA, 0. E.,1 M. OESTERHELD,I J. VRSALOVIC,I A. T. AUSTIN,' I.

We conducted a decomposition experiment in the Patagonian steppe using litter from one of the dominant shrub species, Mulinum spinosum, and litter and roots from the dominant grass species, Stipa speciosa. The experimen tal site was a semi-arid shrub steppe in temperate South America with vegetation distributed as shrub-grass ring patches interspersed with bare soil and isolated tussock grasses. Litterbags were located in four different microsites to evaluate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on decomposition processes: 1) bare soil; 2) beside a tussock grass in the bare soil matrix; 3) within the grass ring surrounding the shrub; and 4) underneath the shrub. Mulinum and Stipa litter were placed aboveground whereas roots were buried to the depth of 5 cm. Bags were incubated in the field for four years, with pickups at six intervals during that time period. Overall, decomposi tion was relatively slow compared to other studies (values of k ranging from -0.11 to -0.35), suggesting that carbon turnover in this ecosystem is slow probably due to low rainfall input and cold temperatures. Location had a large and consistent effect on rates of mass loss, with both litter types and buried roots following the same pattern of rates of mass loss: bare soil &gt; tussock &gt; grass ring &gt; below shrub. The variation in decomposition and the slower decomposition under the shrubs could contribute to the higher concentration of organic matter found at this microsite, and promote or maintain the spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical characteristics of this ecosystem.

As demand for goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) and ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) intensifies due to the herbal plant trade, basic information about distribution and abundance is needed to inform management strate gies. We surveyed 13 sites in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, and Maryland to determine H. canadensis and P. quinquefolius presence and abundance. At each site, two to five large plots, chosen to include a range of aspect and elevation, were intensively searched. Abundance of P. quinquefolius was greater on east and west facing slopes, but was not affected by elevation. H. canadensis abundance was not affected by aspect or elevation. Both H. canadensis and P. quinquefolius were more likely to be found at lower elevations. Presence of both species was also affected by aspect with both species being encountered more frequently on east facing slopes. H. canadensis grows in dense patches which may be sepa rated by extreme distances and appears to have rather specific habitat re quirements; P. quinquefolius grows in small patches or singly, often sep arated by only a few meters and is more broadly distributed, although nowhere is it abundant. The contrasting dispersion patterns of these two rare, harvested species have important implications for apparency to har vesters. Ginseng is less likely to be completely harvested in any one harvest event, but more likely to be encountered by a single harvester. Goldenseal, however, is more likely to be completely harvested when found, however, it will be encountered less frequently in a random walk across the land scape. SANDERS, N. J. and D. M. GORDON.

Interspecific competition is an important influence on the structure of com munities. But the mechanisms of competition are not well understood, and the importance of competition can vary both spatially and temporally. In desert ants, competitive interactions with Myrmecocystus mimicus and M. depilis lead to significant changes in the resource use of Aphaenogaster cockerelli. Our experiments showed that the influence of Myrmecocystus neighbors on A. cockerelli was dependent on resource type. When colonies competed at patches stocked with protein resources, Myrmecocystus for agers tended to displace A. cockerelli foragers. But, in patches stocked with seed resources, A. cockerelli displaced Myrmecocystus foragers. The mech 194 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="156">anism for this seems to be that Myrmecocystus foragers are more aggressive and actively displace A. cockerelli foragers from protein resource patches. We then examined how such resource-dependent species interactions influ ence the structure of communities. It is generally accepted that ant com munities are structured in transitive dominance hierarchies as a result of competitive interactions, where ecologically dominant species are those species that are more abundant at resource patches than would be expected given their actual abundance in the community. But if the outcome of competitive interactions is resource-dependent, then ecological dominance, and therefore community structure, is also likely to be resource-dependent. We tested this hypothesis by offering protein and seed resources in eight replicate desert ant communities of similar diversity and composition. Though the most abundant species tended always to be ecologically dom inant, there was considerable variation in dominance hierarchies among communities. Interestingly, there was no overall effect of resource type on ecological dominance. Rather, species responded to resources differently, and the influence of resource type on ecological dominance varied among communities. Since ecological dominance is determined by the outcome of interactions at resources, and interactions vary with resources, we suggest that the organization of desert ant communities is contingent upon resource dependent interactions. SANDERSON, J. G. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM. Spatial organization of communities: A unified null model methodol ogy. Using a matrix null model, metric, and test that I have used previously to analyze island communities for species co-occurrence patterns, I reanalyzed a herpetofaunal assemblage collected along an elevational gradient from Mount Kupe, Cameroon, for unusual species co-occurrence patterns. The null space was generated using a recursive backtracking method and si multaneously conserved both row and column sums. Species' range spans were derived from the actual incidence matrix. Each of 1,000,000 unique uniform-random communities was generated beginning with a matrix of Os. I compared the number of times each pair of confamilial species co occurred in the null space with the same number derived from the actual incidence matrix. I also compared range gaps and overlaps for each pair of species with those in the null space. I found several examples of check erboard patterns between congeneric species (patterns of mutual exclusiv ity) and other species' co-occurrence patterns that differed significantly from chance expectations (P &lt; 0.01). My results differ from those obtained by others using a different null model approach in which the majority of species co-occurrences showed no significant pattern even among conge neric species suspected of exhibiting competitive interactions. This finding suggests that the null model methodology and associated metric developed to analyze island communities and described here is a powerful tool also applicable to the analysis of communities along gradients.

Population viability of Puget Sound chinook salmon: The importance of knowing popula tion structure. An important charge for conservation ecologists is to quantify the proba bility that endangered species will survive in the future. Although assess ments of extinction risk are a standard step in evaluating population via bility, such analyses are often needed before data describing population structure and abundance are fully available. In this study, we evaluated how estimates of population viability differ in relation to how populations are spatially defined and how much information is available. We addressed these questions using abundance time series for endangered Puget Sound chinook salmon. We compared extinction risks for small, individual pop ulations to those for larger aggregations of these individual populations. The small and large units for analyses were purposefully chosen because they are spatial scales currently used by managers to make management decisions regarding chinook salmon, although these management units may not represent true biological populations. Overall, extinction risks were much greater for individual populations compared to aggregations of in dividual populations (9/13 cases, data were standardized to eliminate pop ulation size biases). This suggests that if these small, individual populations were closer to the true biological populations, management actions that occur at larger, aggregated scales may result in the loss of individual pop ulations. We also evaluated how the estimated extinction risk varied with the amount of data available in space and time. Overall, extinction risks were lower for areas with more geographic coverage and with longer time series, although the results were dependent on the particular sequence of years used in the analysis. These results demonstrate how different char acterizations of population structure and data coverage affect estimates of population viability. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of conducting viability analyses on biologically defined populations. SANFORD, M. P. and N. HUNTLY.

We studied whether the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida) selectively feeds on joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia) based on leaf nitrogen. Joshua trees allocate higher tissue nitrogen to south-facing leaves. We measured azimuth of all leaf rosettes of 22 Yucca trees containing Neotoma herbivory at our Mojave Desert study site and determined numbers and proportions of ro settes with eaten leaves or leaf parts. Nitrogen content was measured for leaves on north and south-facing rosettes, immature and mature leaves, leaf bases and tips, and for uneaten and partially eaten leaves. Neotoma her bivory was concentrated on leaf tips, mature leaves, leaves of south-facing rosettes, and trees with higher mean nitrogen. Leaf tips and leaves of south facing rosettes contained more nitrogen than leaf bases and leaves of north facing rosettes. Mature leaves had higher water content than immature leaves. Neotoma fed from more rosettes of trees that had higher nitrogen content. Thus, N. lepida fed selectively within leaves, among and within rosettes, and among trees of Y. brevifolia based on nitrogen and on water content. SAUNDERS, C. J.,I A. S. MARSH2 and B. G.

Aboveground production of C3 and C4 species in a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh as a result of salinity, flood ing, CO2, and CO2 interactions. Peak season aboveground biomass of three species was measured for 13 years in an ongoing C02-enrichment study in three plant communities (a pure C3, pure C4, and a mixed C3/ C4 community) in a Chesapeake Bay salt marsh. We examined the relationship of biomass to elevated CO2 and its interactions with salinity, water table, temperature and plant cover den sity using a Bayesian analysis. Previous studies were used to generate prior models relating production to salinity, water table, temperature, and density. Ten studies were used for Spartina patens (C4), three for Scirpus olneyi (C3 sedge), and four for Distichlis spicata (C4 grass). The prior "ambient CO," models were updated to posterior ambient CO2 models by incorpo rating our data. The best model was then selected using a posterior odds ratio test. CO2 terms (simple and interactions) were added to the best pos terior model, and the best C02-effects model was determined. Posterior ambient CO2 models for each species increased in variability relative to the prior models, due to weak relationships of production with the inter annual variability of salinity, water table, and temperature. On the other hand, previous years' production (up to 5 years before present) more faith fully predicted biomass in all species, suggesting the importance of an undescribed plot-specific factor. While a significant main effect of CO2 was found early in the experiment, the main effect over the entire 13 years was weak, and no CO2 interactions were necessary to explain the variability. Our Bayesian analysis has several advantages for ongoing CO2 field ex periments: We are able to summarize prior information for each plant spe cies to assess the current knowledge of competing controls on production; updating the prior models with our data provides a useful baseline for assessing the effects of C02; finally, the Bayesian approach facilitates book keeping for incorporating new information and assessing the precision gained from each year of CO2 enrichment.

Exotic species increase biodiversity of is lands. The increase in human population, and the associated consumption of re sources and alteration of habitats, is causing the extinction of many species. Oral Presentation Abstracts 195</page><page sequence="157">The resulting decrease in biodiversity at a global scale has also been as sumed to occur at local and regional scales. Consequently, much recent ecological research has focused on the effects of reduced local diversity on ecosystem functioning. However, the introduction of exotic species by hu mans can increase local biodiversity. The net impact of humans on biodi versity is a product of the opposing influences of introductions and extinc tions. Island biogeography theory (IBT) provides a framework for exam ining these processes. As an empirical test of IBT we examined net changes in diversity on islands, whose ecosystems have been altered substantially by humans. Diversity of birds was stable, albeit with modified species composition, whereas diversity of fishes and plants increased substantially. Although island biodiversity has not declined, increases in diversity may pose equally serious threats to ecosystem functioning. Future ecological research needs to examine the impacts of increases in local diversity in the face of declines in global diversity. SCHAACK, S. and L. J. CHAPMAN. University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. Functional-morphological trade-offs in an African Cyprinid: Implications for faunal diversification. Adaptive change in one character may affect a second, non-functionally related character in an adaptive or non-adaptive way. For example, in some species, fish living in low oxygen environments have larger gills than con specifics living in normoxic or high oxygen water. This may alter feeding structures and therefore have indirect effects on other fitness components. This study investigates whether adaptive variation in gill size of the African cyprinid Barbus neumayeri constrains associated trophic structures and af fects foraging ecology and fitness-related characters among populations. Barbus neumayeri from the dense interior of a papyrus swamp have much larger gills than fish from connected streams where oxygen levels are high. Reciprocal transplant experiments showed lower survivorship for small gilled fish when placed in hypoxic swamp waters, indicating large-gilled fish in the swamp may be demonstrating an adaptive response. Although there is no apparent survivorship cost to large gills in high oxygen, these fish may suffer a competitive disadvantage if their large gills impact as sociated feeding structures. We compared the trophic morphology and feed ing ability of fish from small- and large-gilled populations. Fish from the two habitats differed significantly in both exterual measurements and the structural elements surrounding the gills. This rearrangement of muscles in the large-gilled fish suggests a reduction in biting capacity. In paired feed ing trials, large-gilled fish spent more time feeding than small-gilled fish of the same body size, without ingesting more food. These results suggest less efficient food intake in large-gilled fish. Field data (length-weight mea surements) from the different populations showed lower condition in swamp-dwelling fish that may reflect the observed differences in prey avail ability and diet, hypoxia stress, or less efficient feeding behavior. We argue that variation in gill size has facilitated the broad habitat distribution of Barbus neumayeri. However, gill size and changes in associated structures may limit the success of phenotypes crossing physico-chemical gradients and lead to to diversification in this species. SCHAEFFER, S. M., S. A.

Nitrogen (N) is thought to be the second most limiting resource controlling net primary production (NPP) next to water in arid and semi-arid ecosys tems. Nitrogen cycling by soil microbes may be limited by carbon (C) available to soil microbes. We investigated the effects of carbon and N additions on ammonia (NH3) volatilization, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification in a Mojave desert ecosystem in order to assess potential limitations of C or N to these processes. All combinations of C and N additions were made at approximately four times ambient levels at four types of locations: Under the canopies of a C3 evergreen shrub, C4 perennial bunchgrass, and a C3 deciduous shrub, as well as in the interspaces. Ad dition of C reduced NH3 volatilization by 53% (from 8.49 +/- 1.10 pFg N NH3 m-2 hr-1 to 4.50 +/- 0.74 pFg m-2 hr-1 for plots with added C and no added C respectively) while added N, in the form of KNO3, had no effect on volatilization. After 24 hours, ammonium (NH4) levels were lower with C addition compared to controls (2.12 +/- 0.39, 0.25 +/- .25, 2.91 +/- 0.71, and 0.99 +/- 0.35, jig g dry soil-I for control, +C, +N, and +C+N plots respectively). Soil CO2 fluxes indicated relatively greater microbial activity with added C compared to controls (32.40 +/- 7.61, 67.64 +/- 13.70, 21.36 +/- 6.01, and 83.18 +/- 9.12, jig C-CO2 m-2 hr1 for control, +C, +N, and +C+N plots respectively). Potential denitrification rates were relatively greater under plant canopies compared to interspaces (2.99 +/- 2.23, 30.34 +i- 7.13, 11.95 +/- 5.33, and 21.03 +/- 7.15, ng N-N20 g dry soil -1 for interspace, C3 evergreen, C4 bunchgrass, and C3 deciduous plots respec tively). Decreases in NH3 volatilization, NH4 levels, and increases in soil CO2 flux with added C suggest an increase in microbial immobilization of inorganic N, and further indicate a potential C limitation for microbial activity in this arid ecosystem. By characterizing the response of these ecosystem processes to potential changes in C availability we can gain an improved understanding of the structure and function of arid ecosystems and how they may respond to various types of perturbations.

Water use and stomatal conductance of Pinus taeda L. and Liquidambar styraciflua under ambient and elevated CO2. Plant water use was scaled from sap flux measured in a maturing loblolly pine forest at the FACTS-I (forest atmosphere transfer and storage) facility in the Duke Forest, NC, USA. Sap flux measurements of eight Pinus taeda and four Liquidambar styraciflua trees were made with Granier-type sensors at each of six clusters within the stand-three under ambient atmospheric CO2 (360 jLmol mol-l) and three under elevated CO2 (ambient + 200 jimol mol-1) conditions. Canopy transpiration was estimated from sap flux mea surements scaled with sapwood area per unit ground area for each species separately. Total stand transpiration agreed well with latent heat flux mea sured with the eddy-covariance technique. Mean canopy stomatal conduc tance was estimated for each species from transpiration and vapor pressure deficit. Stomatal conductance of both species were significantly lower un der elevated than under ambient atmospheric CO2 under severe drought. SCHAUBER, E. M.12 and R. S. OSTFELD.2 'University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; 2lnstitute of Ecosystem Studies, Millbrook, NY USA. Decaying reservoir competence and lyme disease ecology. Many vector-borne diseases require transmission from a reservoir host to the vector, which then infects other hosts (sometimes humans). Reservoir competence is the probability that a vector feeding on an infected host will become infected. A competent reservoir infects a large proportion of vec tors that feed on it. Reservoir competence is also called "host infectivity", and is affected by the host immune response and the ability of the pathogen to escape that response. Reservoir competence varies among host species, but competence of an individual host also tends to decay over time since it was last infected, as its immune system suppresses the pathogen popu lation or pathogens leave the bloodstream and invade other tissues. How ever, standard epidemiological models assume that reservoir competence is a species-specific constant. We explored the importance of reservoir com petence decay for Lyme disease ecology using a simple epidemiological model with either one or two host species that differed only in the slope and intercept of competence decay curves. We compared the predictions of this model with predictions under the assumption that competence of each species was constant. We found that reservoir competence decay con tributed positive feedback to this system: Hosts whose competence decayed rapidly were typically incompetent when infected vectors were scarce, re ducing the infection prevalence of the vectors they fed. However, the same hosts had high competence when infected vectors were abundant, increas ing the infection prevalence of the next vector generation. In a two-host system, competence decay caused the dilution effect of a less-competent reservoir to be considerably reduced at high densities of infected vectors. Similar results emerged from a more complex simulation incorporating seasonal dynamics of blacklegged ticks and their mammalian hosts. This mechanism may help explain the rapid rise in Lyme disease risk in areas of increasing tick populations, and highlights the potential impact of host community composition on the ecology and dynamics of this and other emerging diseases. 196 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="158">SCHELLER, R. M. and D. J. MLADENOFF University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA. Forest understory spatial pattern ing in old-growth and managed northern hardwood forests in Wiscon sin and Michigan. As a forest stand matures, forest structure and resource availability become increasingly heterogeneous. Interspecific competition and dispersal pro cesses also occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales. These processes are reflected in the spatial pattern of the landscape. We hypothesize that forest understory communities in northern Wisconsin exhibit smaller patch size and greater heterogeneity when resource heterogeneity is large and forest structure is more developed. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the spatial patterns of understory plant communities in three forest types: 1) old-growth forests, 2) second-growth, even-aged forests, and 3) uneven aged forests with recent selective logging. A new method, the sociogram, was developed to measure the patch size and patch heterogeneity of eco logical communities. The sociogram is modeled after the semivariogram and uses S0rensen's coefficient to define community dissimilarity. The so ciogram was applied at scales ranging from a single quadrat (4 i2) up to the extent of the forest stand. Results from 12 forest stands indicate that understory communities in old-growth and uneven-aged forests have small er average patch sizes and greater community heterogeneity, when com pared to even-aged forests. These results are independent of the alpha di versity found in the forest stands and reflect differences in resource het erogeneity and forest structure. The spatial patterning found in old-growth forests may enhance both ecological stability and biodiversity. SCHENK, H. and R. B. JACKSON. Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. Determinants of rooting depth in water-limited ecosystems of the tem perate zone. Amount and timing of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration are major factors in determining which plant life-forms dominate water-limited ecosystems. Global and and semi-arid ecosystems of the temperate zone dominated by succulents, shrubs, dwarf-shrubs, or grasses were the subject of this study. Plant life-forms often differ in rooting depth, and results from modeling studies suggest that climatic change may alter life-form spectra in water-limited ecosystems by altering soil water dynamics and thus fa voring more deeply or more shallowly rooted plants. Alternatively, climate may primarily affect life-form specific traits above ground, and changes in rooting characteristics may largely be an indirect consequence of vegetation change. The relative importance of abiotic vs. biotic factors for determining rooting depth was analyzed for -100 root profiles, together with data on site hydrology, soil characteristics, presence of life forms, deciduous vs. evergreen habit, and photosynthetic type of the dominant life forms. Gen eral linear models of rooting depth as a function of abiotic and biotic factors explained -50% of the variation observed in the data, with site hydrology explaining -17% and life form explaining -24%. In a discriminant anal ysis, where rooting depth was treated as one of several environmentally controlled factors determining life-form dominance, inclusion of rooting depth improved predictions by only -10% overall, but greatly improved ability to predict dwarf-shrub dominance. The results suggest that differ ences in rooting depth are only one of several factors driving changes in life form dominance, such as the widespread encroachment of woody plants into grasslands. SCHEUERELL, M. D. University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195. Temporal variability in physical-chemical coupling to algal quality and zooplankton production dynamics. Understanding how the physical and chemical features of ecosystems affect producer-consumer interactions remains an important goal of ecology. Re cent models of lakes suggest that interactions between light and nutrient availability in the mixed layer determine the C:P ratio of phytoplankton, and hence, food quality for herbivorous zooplankton. Similarly, increases in algal food quality have also been shown to positively affect zooplankton growth and reproductive rates. However, these studies have mostly con centrated on explaining variation among lakes over relatively short time periods and have not evaluated the long-term dynamics in the physical chemical forcing of algal quality and zooplankton production in individual systems. Using dynamic linear models to analyze a high-resolution, 22 year time series from Lake Washington, I investigated the effect of the light:nutrient ratio on algal food quality (measured as the algal chlorophyll: biovolume ratio) and the subsequent effect of this food quality on zoo plankton production. The ratio of light to total phosphorus generally had a positive effect on the ratio of phytoplankton chlorophyll a to biovolume, but the effect was negative in some years. I also detected a positive rela tionship between algal food quality and Daphnia birth rates. In both cases, I also found strong seasonal differences with the largest effects occurring in mid-summer and the lowest in winter. These results demonstrate strong intra- and inter-seasonal variation in the forcing of light and nutrient re gimes on algal food quality and its subsequent effect on zooplankton pro duction dynamics.

Conservation, harvest and human behavior in Lake Victoria fisheries. Despite the impressive progress that has been made towards developing a predictive understanding of the dynamics of interacting species, very little effort has been devoted towards embracing the roles of exotic species, and especially humans, in ecosystem dynamics. The food webs of Lake Victoria (East Africa) have been altered greatly by the interactive effects of exotic species and exploitation by fisheries. An exotic predator (Nile perch) has contributed to the extinction of more than 200 endemic fish species and presently threatens at least that many more. However, fisheries for the ex otic species is a major economic activity in this region and their sustain ability is a critical management concerm. We used individual-based models calibrated to field data and fisheries catch data to investigate the ecological impacts of commercial fisheries on the structure and dynamics of the food web of Lake Victoria, and estimate the consequences of these impacts for the conservation of endemic fishes and sustainability of fisheries. Our anal yses show that the size-selective mortality imposed by fishing strongly mediates the effects of exotic predators on the native food webs. We esti mate that fishing presently reduces predation by the exotic predator on native species by &gt;10 fold. Analyses that incorporate adaptive behaviors by fishers in response to changes in the exploited populations further re inforce the importance of humans as strong interactors in this system. Nile perch populations are especially vulnerable to overexploitation when fisher behavior is flexible and can track changes in population size-structure. Thus, in this ecosystem, adaptive human behaviors may actually benefit the short-term goals of conservation by reducing predation by an exotic species, but at the possible expense of the sustainability of an economically valuable resource. SCHMELING, J. D. and D. L. MOORHEAD. University of Toledo, To ledo, OH 43606 USA. Carbon flow dynamics in benthic microbial mats of Lake Hoare, Antarctica. Carbon is sequestered by cyanobacteria-dominated microbial mats in the permanently ice-covered lakes of Antarctica. Light availability under the ice of Lake Hoare, in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, is approximately 1% of ambient photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). A mathematical model was used to simulate the response of microbial mats in Lake Hoare to changing light intensity, in relation to annual accumulation of mat biomass. Currently, microbial mats at 4 m depth accumulate about 12 mg C m2 annually at a maximum photosynthetic rate equal to 9.48 p. moles C m-2h 1. This occurs during a brief period of approximately 145 days. Inactivity during winter allows for sediment accumulation/deposition on the top of the mat, resulting in a layering of organic and inorganic materials in sed iments. Model simulations suggest that microbial mats at 4 meters depth would show little response to increased light intensity, as their photosyn thetic rates are saturated at extremely low light levels. Thus, variations in organic matter deposition revealed by benthic sediment cores over the past 1200 years are unlikely to be the direct result of fluctuating light intensity that could have resulted from changing ice thickness or attenuation by the water column.

We investigated how simulated trampling (by horse or sheep hooves) and drought (imposed by transparent roofs) influenced the productivity of 1-, Oral Presentation Abstracts 197</page><page sequence="159">2-, 4-, 8-, and 32-species plant communities at an experimental site of the EU-BIODEPTH network. Community and species biomasses were mea sured prior, during, and after perturbation over a 2-year period. Further, the invasibility of the communities by weeds was assessed during and after perturbation. To reach a given amount of total biomass, more species were needed in perturbed than in unperturbed communities for both kinds of perturbation. The absolute reduction of community productivity due to per turbation increased with diversity. However, because productivity itself also increased with diversity the proportional reduction was constant across di versity levels. One year after the experimental drought all communities had fully regained their pre-drought productivity values. Shifts in community composition after drought were small, but more weeds invaded in low than in high-diversity plots. Simulated trampling had small effects on the weed phytometer Ranunculus repens. These results suggest that the shape of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships is relatively insensitive to perturbation. Diverse systems produce more biomass both without and with perturbation, but at least in terms of productivity they may not be more resistant or resilient than less diverse systems. SCHMIDT, K.

We examined the effects of separate removal experiments of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), and the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), on nest predation rates of forest songbirds. Mice are numerically dominant at our study sites, intensely exploit their habitat, and prior studies in our sites indicated that mice interact strongly, and chipmunks weakly, with other species in the community. Therefore, we hypothesized that removal of mice would result in decreased levels of nest predation relative to treat ments with a complete predator assemblage, but that the removal of chip munks would not. Both hypotheses were supported. Mice depredated &gt; 60% of artificial nests in control plots (mouse populations intact), whereas chipmunks depredated - 20%. Daily nest mortality rates were more than halved in mouse removal treatments relative to controls (0.097 vs. 0.221; P&lt;0.005), but were virtually identical between chipmunk removal and con trol treatments (0.237 vs. 0.229). Nonetheless, when we examined preda tion rates across plots in which the density of mice varied naturally, total daily mortality rates declined as the density of mice increased. This pattern occurred because mortality from non-mouse predators decreased as the den sity of mice increased and overwhelmed increasing mortality from mice to drive the overall dynamics of the system. Analysis of the relationships between the density of mice and predation rates by mice as a function of the abundance of natural food in their environment revealed probable rea sons for these conflicting results. We suggest that high local densities of mice deplete resources for larger, non-mouse predators, which preferen tially occupy areas of few mice and high local food abundance. In these areas, songbirds may be faced with higher overall nest predation dominated by non-mouse predators. Mice thus influence nest predation rates through both direct and indirect pathways.

The gap hypothesis suggests that the high light environment in gaps fosters increased germination, es tablishment, and growth for the seedlings of many plant species. The gap hypothesis, however, has had limited empirical support, and some recent studies have even suggested that gaps play a 'neutral" role in the mainte nance of diversity in tropical forests. Most gap studies have ignored the influence of lianas (woody vines), an important group of plants that can be very abundant in gaps. We hypothesize that lianas reduce tree regeneration and diversity in tropical treefall gaps, and specifically, that tree seedling abundance and diversity will depend upon the abundance of lianas. Further, the role of gaps in the maintenance of tree species diversity may be forest dependent, with gaps playing less of a role in liana-rich forests. We tested this hypothesis in 18 relatively young gaps (1 -2 years old) of 3 different sizes in a moderately liana-rich tropical forest in central Panama. We re moved all of the lianas in 9 of these 18 gaps and monitored tree seedling (&lt; 50 cm in height) recruitment, growth, and mortality for 1 year following the liana removal. We found that tree seedling recruitment was more than 5-times higher in gaps without lianas compared with control gaps, and that this difference was independent of gap size. Seedling growth rates, how ever, were not significantly different in the liana-free and control gaps. There was also no significant difference in seedling mortality between the liana-free and control gaps. These data show that lianas reduce tree seedling establishment in gaps, but have no discernable difference in seedling growth or mortality. We argue that, in liana-rich forests, gaps will probably play much less of a role in the maintenance of tree species diversity than in forests with a lower abundance of lianas. SCHOCH, G., G.

West Coast rocky intertidal diversity: Invertebrates, algae, anchors, a gun and three spark plugs. Evidence suggests that patterns of community structure in rocky intertidal communities are functionally linked to oceanic processes and physical char acteristics of the shoreline. However, there is a lack of information on biotic patterns across large spatial scales (100's of km) that would allow rigorous assessments of the relationship between intertidal community patterns and the physical and biological interactions on rocky shorelines, and in the nearshore and offshore ocean. As a major research component of PISCO (Partnership for the Interdisciplinary Study of Coastal Oceans), a consor tium of four West Coast Universities, a multi-scale dataset is being devel oped to evaluate these associations. Rocky shorelines at 14 areas along the Eastern Pacific upwelling system from Northern Washington to Southern California were partitioned into relatively homogeneous alongshore seg ments of 10-100 m based on slope angle, topographic complexity, near shore bathymetry, and wave runup. Within each of the 14 areas, three sets of three replicate segments were selected for annual biological sampling. Macro-organisms (primarily invertebrates and algae) were sampled along horizontal transects at three elevations within each replicate alongshore segment. We compared the abundance and frequency of each taxon (nested ANOVA's), and community structure (NMS ordinations) among each set of three replicates, among the three sets of replicates within each area, and among the 14 areas. Results suggest that nearshore bathymetry, wave en ergy dissipation, and the presence of sand are strongly correlated with low zone patterns and that physically similar low zone habitats supported sim ilar biological communities even when separated by distances of 100's of kilometers. We conclude that this supports the hypothesis that rocky inter tidal community structure is predictably associated with physical charac teristics of the shoreline and the physical and biological characteristics of the nearshore ocean. This information is being used to guide process-ori ented research on the roles of upwelling, productivity, larval transport, recruitment, and species interactions aimed at understanding the mecha nisms underlying the observed patterns, thus providing a unique source of relevant information for managers and policy makers.

Limber pine (Pinus flexilis James) grows across a wider range of elevations than any other tree species in the central Rockies, from approximately 1600 m at Pawnee Buttes to over 3300 m at Rollins Pass. In this study we investigated two possible explanations for limber pine's success across a broad range of elevations: (1) the sites on which it is found, although separated by more than a thousand meters elevation, may not be very different with respect to environmental factors that affect tree growth, and (2) limber pine growth is insensitive to environmental factors that change with elevation. We compared site characteristics of twelve limber pine stands at elevations ranging from 1630 to 3328 meters as well as the growth and morphology of trees in each of these stands. Mean daily air temperature in July decreased linearly with the elevation of the site from 22.8 oC to 12.6 oC. The growth and morphology of limber pine leaves, shoots and trees was, in general, not related to the elevation or July mean air temper ature of the sites. There was, however, a significant decrease in stomatal 198 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="160">density with increasing elevation, which may be an acclimational response to restrict water loss at high elevations. Our data suggest that the funda mental and realized niche of limber pine is broad with respect to air tem perature. In light of the high gene flow and only slight genetic differenti ation among populations of species with bird- dispersed seeds, such as limber pine, it is especially unusual to see similar growth throughout an environmental gradient. Physiological and anatomical plasticity or wide physiological tolerance ranges may enable limber pine to uncouple its growth from its environment. SCHOOLEY, R. L. and J. A. WIENS. Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523 USA. A habitat specialist in a naturally fragmented landscape: Thresholds and constraints. A central issue in both basic and applied ecology regards the response of organisms to habitat patchiness. In particular, how does patch area interact with other landscape variables at multiple spatial scales to influence the distribution and abundance of animals? We asked this question for a habitat specialist with limited mobility that lives in naturally fragmented land scapes: A cactus bug (Chelinidea vittiger) that occurs within patches of its host plant (Opuntia polyacantha). Within landscapes that represented gra dients of patch density and matrix structure, we mapped and measured attributes of all cactus patches (&gt; 1,200 total) and of intervening unsuitable habitat. We surveyed each patch and counted the number of nymph and adult cactus bugs. The proportion of patches occupied by bugs ranged from 0.45 to 0.68. Incidence functions based on logistic regression analysis in dicated a nonlinear relationship between patch area and the probability of occupancy. Below a threshold patch size, occupancy was unlikely irre spective of isolation or other landscape features. For occupied patches, the relationship between patch area and number of cactus bugs was triangular within log-log space. We used limiting-factor models based on quantile regression to estimate the upper bound of this relationship. Residuals from this patch-area constraint line were correlated with patch quality and may be related to other landscape variables. Systems that operate on small spa tial scales, such as ours, can provide general insights into animal responses to environmental heterogeneity. SCHRADER, B. A., D. A. ZAHLER, K. A. AVINA and E. C.

Disparate educational backgrounds of students provides an instructional challenge in teaching natural resources. When we encountered this situation in our "Forestry for Teachers" course, we developed an instructional format we believe will be useful in many classroom situations. Students in our class came from two distinct backgrounds: pre-education and natural re sources. Individuals in one group had little or no background in the other. We established a unifying theme around communication, and throughout the class used a natural resource setting and approach to address course objectives. The inherent challenge was to introduce some of the students to new material while building on existing knowledge for others. Ecological concepts and educational theory were the building blocks of the course. We employed a number of teaching techniques throughout the course. Where possible, we paired up the students, one discipline working with another, allowing students with background and training to take leadership roles during a particular laboratory exercise. Other activities included in teractions with successful teachers and natural resource educators, having students perform required internships, as well as designing activity-based learning projects. The class was quite successful. Course objectives were met, students came away with new information and we believe, increased enthusiasm for the role of natural resources in educational programs of all levels. The students worked well together and most importantly they learned from each other, fostering collaboration across university disci plines. SCHREUDER, M. D. J.,l L. W. A. VAN HOVE2 and C. A. BREWER.1 IUiest of Montana, Missoula, MT 59812; 2Wageningen University and Research Center. The effects of leaf wetness on photosynthesis of and ozone deposition to Poplar leaves. Leaf wetness events such as dew, rain and mist are common in field con ditions, and affect gas exchange over leaf surfaces. We examined the effects of leaf wetness on photosynthesis of and ozone deposition to Populus nigra brandaris leaves. Photosynthesis, transpiration and ozone deposition were monitored in light (PAR 420 + 7 SE umol m -2 s-') and dark conditions, and leaves were sprayed with deionized water, and simulated acid rain and mist, with pH 7.0, 4.5 and 3.7 respectively. Background ozone concentra tions in the cuvettes averaged 102 1 SE ug 03 m-3. During light con ditions leaf wetness decreased net photosynthesis by 16 % (p&lt;0.001). Dark respiration decreased by 60, 82 and 100 % using water with pH 7.0, 4.5 and 3.7 respectively (p&lt;0.001). Net photosynthesis and ozone deposition were highly correlated (r2=0.98, p&lt;0.0001). In light conditions leaf wet ness increased ozone deposition by a factor of 1.1, lasting 30 minutes on average. In darkness leaf wetness increased ozone deposition 2.7 to 3.4 times, 160 minutes on average, and effects decreased with lower pH. Ozone deposition to wet leaves in light conditions could be explained by: 1) de creased deposition due to lower stomatal conductance, and 2) increased deposition into the water film (r2=0.86, p&lt;0.001). Thus, leaf wetness and water pH significantly altered CO2 gas exchange and ozone deposition, especially at night. These factors need to be incorporated in ozone depo sition models. SCHUELLER, S. K. University of Michgian, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. California mainland vs. Channel Island pollination of Nicotiana glauca (Solanaceae): An invasive hummingbird-pollinated plant. Because of their unique pollinator conditions relative to the mainland, is lands provide an ideal system for testing the effect of pollinators on plant reproductive success and floral evolution. Recent invasive plants provide a rare opportunity to view early establishment on islands and to investigate how plants respond to insular pollination. I studied California mainland and Channel Island populations of Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco, Solanaceae), a widespread hummingbird-pollinated invasive that has colonized the is lands within the last century. I tested the following major predictions: 1) Pollinators of island plants are a unique subset of mainland pollinators and, in response, island plants will evolve unique floral traits, 2) Visitation to island plants is less frequent than to mainland plants, and plants will evolve greater ability to self-pollinate on islands. Observations, floral measure ments and hand-pollination experiments were performed across two main land and two island (Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz) study sites in 1998 and 1999. Five hummingbird species occur on the mainland and two on the islands, but the number of pollinator species actually visiting plant populations was equivalent across sites, with a difference in the relative composition: Anna's and Black-chinned on the mainland, and Allen's and Anna's on the islands. The dominant pollinator on the islands (70-90% of total visits), the Island Allen's hummingbird, has a longer bill than main land hummingbirds, and as predicted, island plants had significantly longer corollas (1.5 mm) than mainland plants. Although the frequency of visi tation was not consistently lower on islands, the island plants did demon strate a greater ability to self-pollinate than mainland plants. Autogamy (measured as the mean ratio of bagged to supplemental-self pollinated fruit set) was higher on both Catalina (0.49) and Cruz (0.85) than the mainland sites (both 0.13) and reflected significantly shorter anther-stigma distances (herkogamy) for island than mainland plants. These results from a recently introduced plant demonstrate how quickly plants can evolve in response to colonization and insular pollination. SCHULTZ, P. A.,' R. M. MILLER,2 J. D. JASROW,2 C. V.

Evidence of a mycor rhizal mechanism for the adaptation of Andropogon gerardii to high and low-nutrient prairies. Andropogon gerardii is highly dependent upon its association with arbus cular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) when grown on phosphorus-deficient soils in Kansas, but on Illinois soils with greater phosphorus supply rates, the growth of A. gerardii is not dependent on mycorrhizal infection. We grew ecotypes of A. gerardii obtained from Kansas and Illinois in a controlled environment on their own and each other's soils, with and without mycor rhizal infection. Each ecotype grew comparatively better in its own soil indicating adaptation to their soils of origin. Overall, A. gerardii benefited more from AMF in Kansas soil than Illinois soil. The two ecotypes, how ever, did not benefit equally from mycorrhizal infection, the Kansas isolate Oral Presentation Abstracts 199</page><page sequence="161">was three times more responsive to mycorrhizal infection in the Kansas soil than was the Illinois isolate. Our results indicate that plant adaptation to the nutrient levels of their local soils is due at least in part to a shift in their dependence on mycorrhizal fungi. In the course of adapting to the nutrient rich soils of Illinois, A. gerardii has apparently evolved a reduced dependence upon these fungi and greater reliance on a more highly branched root system for phosphorus uptake. This reduced dependence was seen in a root system that was significantly more branched than the Kansas ecotype. In contrast, the Kansas ecotype had a coarser root system and invested proportionately greater carbon in the symbiotic association with AMF as measured by spore production. This study provides the first dem onstration that plants can adapt to changing soil nutrient levels by shifting their dependence on AM fungi This result has broad implications for our understanding of the role of these fungi in agricultural systems and the adaptation of plants to a changing environment.

Variable biochemical responses by oaks to di verse environmental stimuli. Biochemical responses by oak trees to environmental stimuli like insects, wounding, light, and wind motion can be highly variable, and trees may even fail to respond to certain insects. To understand the basis of variation in responses by the trees, we have begun exploring the regulatory roles of within-plant signalling mechanisms. First year red oak seedlings were dam aged by fourth-instar gypsy moth larvae over a two-week period in the greenhouse. Chemical analyses indicated that this stimulated condensed tannin accumulation compared with unattacked controls. Similar seedlings were then exposed to a wound hormone, jasmonic acid, every other day for two weeks. These trees exhibited increased condensed tannin concen trations very much like the gypsy moth-wounded trees, suggesting that the lipoxygenase/jasmonate wound signalling system widespread in other plants is also involved in oak responses to gypsy moths. We then examined enzymatic responses of the seedlings to gypsy moths, artificial wounding, jasmonates, and salicylate (a signal involved primarily in responses to path ogens). Seedlings were treated with gypsy moth larvae, paper punches, jasmonates and salicylate over a two-week period in the greenhouse. Var ious defense enzymes (peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase) and especially per oxidase isoforms were idiosyncratically induced by various stimuli and combinations of stimuli. Activities of individual peroxidase isoforms, which play a role in activating the polyphenol defenses of oaks, were tuned to specific signals, stimuli and their combinations. Red oak trees appear very flexible in their ability to perceive and respond differentially to en vironmental stimuli, including different insect attackers. SCHULZ, K.,' J. ZASADA,2 K. KAHL,' E.

Does dense sugar maple regeneration in gaps reduce herbaceous understory species richness in western Great Lakes conifer-hardwood forests? Sugar maple, Acer saccharum, is the dominant species in the mesic conifer hardwood forests of states adjacent Lake Superior. Forest management practices, logging history, and heavy browsing pressure by white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, maintain, and have probably increased the dominance of maple in the region. Maple recruits heavily to the entire forest floor. Formation of large, single tree gaps and bigger openings per mits stands of seedlings to develop into crowed populations of larger in dividuals 2-5 m tall. Light availability beneath these populations is low (typical midday PAR &lt; 20 B m-2 s'l). Cover of herbaceous species in these areas is conspicuously low. Widespread propagation of canopy openings during harvest could conceivably convert large parts of the forest under story into this kind of herb habitat. We examined summer herb commu nities beneath an array of seedling/sapling canopies in the Sylvania Wil derness (Ottawa NF in the MI Upper Peninsula) to determine whether this pattern of forest regeneration eliminated certain species locally, and poten tially reduced species richness. Seeding/sapling overstories in the 2-5 m height range were associated with a doubling in the area of non-vegetated surface, but no reduction in species richness. Shorter and taller overstories were not associated with a reduction in cover or richness, suggesting that this phase of canopy replacement forms a temporary constraint on under story species. If microsuccessional patterns of herb diversity are a predict able result of maple canopy dynamics, it is important to limit the extent of canopy opening in forest harvest. Small, isolated herb populations created as part of the microsuccessional sequence are prone to local extinction. SCHURBON, J. M. University of Charleston, Charleston, SC 29424 USA. Effect of prescribed burning on amphibians in the Francis Marion National Forest, SC. Fire affects the life cycles, abundance and diversity of plants, birds, mam mals and reptiles, but its effect on amphibians is not well known. I deter mined the effect of prescribed burning on amphibians in loblolly and lon gleaf pine associations within the Francis Marion National Forest. I mon itored amphibian assemblages at 15 ponds that represent 5 different burn histories (0, 1, 3, 5 and &gt;8 years since burn) using drift fences with pitfalls, anuran calling censuses and PVC treefrog shelters. Total species richness did not differ among burn regimes. No direct negative effects of fire on amphibians were detected, probably due to their subterranean habits or residency in unburned areas within and near ponds. Ambystomid salaman ders were more common in stands that had not been burned within the previous 3 years. These stands had greater leaf litter volumes, which pro vided moist microhabitats and moderated subterranean temperatures. Low intensity fires associated with the historical burn frequency of 2-4 years maintained historical vegetation characteristics and allowed leaf litter ac cumulations required to support amphibian populations.

The influence of edaphic factors and plant diversity on detriti vore community composition: Termites and decomposition in semi-arid grasslands and woodlands of the Okavango Delta, Africa. Understanding how communities contribute to biogeochemical processes is difficult because in most ecosystems much of mineralization, immobiliza tion, and decomposition is mediated by complex mesofaunal and microbial communities. In semi-arid African savannas, however, decomposition is carried out primarily by the termite community, which is composed of readily identified and manipulated species. Study of this relatively simple decomposer community has revealed the importance of community com position in the ecosystem functioning of the decomposer subsystem. In particular, the presence of fungus-growing species of the sub-family Ma crotermitinae, which vary in distribution and abundance, was associated with wood decomposition rates three times higher than in sites where they were absent. Following experimental determination of termite community composition, I used physical, chemical, and stable isotope analyses, to ex amine how edaphic factors and plant diversity influence termite diversity. Fungus comb stable carbon isotope ratios (ranging from -11.14 to -24.22 0/ 00 vs PDB) showed that the dominant, mound-building species, Macro termes michaelseni, generally considered a grass specialist, consumes both grass (all C4 in the study site) and wood litter and shows no clear prefer ence. Results also showed that soil properties, particularly clay content, are important determinants of Macrotermitine distribution. Collectively, these findings suggest that edaphic factors have a major influence on termite distribution, while local plant diversity may have some influence on abun dance but is a less important determinant of distribution. SCHWARTZ, S. S. 1,2 and K. HAMBRIGHT 2 l Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; 2Kinneret Limnological Laboratory, Tiberias, Israel. Rev elations on the structure of Bosmina populations in Lake Kinneret, Israel. It has been know for more than four decades that in Lake Kinneret Bosmina longirostris occurs as two forms, Bi. l.ongirostris with relatively straight antennules and RIl. cornuta, with sharply curved antennules. Our study was prompted by an analysis of a core from the lake revealing a dramatic change in the relative frequency of the two morphs over the last 100 years. Typically the cornuta morph constituted &lt;30% of the individuals found, but in sediments dating from 1916 and 1980, the cornuta morph constituted &gt;50%. The cornuta morph constitutes -40% of all individuals from sed 200 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="162">iments deposited in the 1990's. Given the observed change we wanted to know more about the nature of the differences between the morphs. Using cellulose acetate electrophoresis methodology to examine allozymes we determined that the cornuta morph is a fixed heterozygote at the GPI locus whereas the longirostris morph is a fixed homozygote for the fast allele. We found no evidence of individuals with the slow allele. The two morphs shared the same fixed allele at each of the other five loci examined. This seemingly simple result has profound implications for our understanding of the Bosmina population in the lake. First, the morphs are not simply extremes of phenotypic plasticity. While there is some morphological var iability within each morph, they remain visually distinct. Secondly, it is likely that the cornuta morph is actually a hybrid with one parent now absent from the lake. Hybridization has been described previously in the genus so this is not unusual. Finally, the simplest explanation for an entire population of heterozygous individuals is that the cornuta form is obli gately parthenogenetic. This has only been observed in arctic populations of polyploid individuals. B.i. cornuta is found across Europe and more populations will need to be sampled to determine the breadth of our result.

Genetic variation in and gene flow between San Joaquin kit fox Populations. The San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) was once ubiquitous throughout California's great San Joaquin Valley. However, most of its habitat has been lost to irrigated agriculture, urban development, and oil fields. The remaining foxes are concentrated in four main and several small er populations. To help conserve kit fox, we sought an ecological under standing of the level of genetic variation remaining in these populations and the extent of gene flow among them. Between 1981 and 1999, we collected tissue from kit foxes in 8 populations. We estimated genetic var iability in and gene flow between fox populations using genotypes from 320 foxes at 8 polymorphic,microsatellite markers. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.318 (Panoche) to 0.590 (Lost Hills), while allelic diversity ranged from 2.00 (Lost Hills) to 4.63 (Elk Hills).The apparent discrepancy between genetic diversity measures in the Lost Hills population can be explained by small sample size, as a rarefaction analysis indicated that there was actually no deficit of alleles at Lost Hills. Gene flow appeared moderately high between populations (Fst=0.043). Assignment tests failed to correctly classify many individuals to the population where they were collected. Overall, these data imply that kit fox historically had high levels of gene flow throughout their range. SCHWEITZER, J. A. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff AZ 86011 USA. Superior fitness of hybrid cottonwoods along a western stream: Ecological and conservation implications. Using natural surveys, common gardens and hand-pollinated crosses we tested the hypothesis that hybrid cottonwoods produce as many viable off spring as the pure parentals. We found that hybrid cottonwoods do not support the tension zone, mosaic and bounded superiority models of hybrid fitness. The fitness of hybrid cottonwoods is equal to or greater than at least one of the parental species under all conditions. While Fremont ge notypes (Populus fremontii) allocate more resources to their seeds than narrowleaf genotypes (P. angustifolia) or their hybrids, they are not more successful in creating viable offspring. Both narrowleaf and hybrid cotton woods regularly produce ramets, which the Fremont genotypes do not gen erally produce. By combining data on multiple parameters of reproduction, we found that narrowleaf and hybrid genotypes can produce offspring with out the specific environmental conditions that cottonwood seeds and seed lings require. Because &gt; 90% of germinated seeds of all cottonwood tree types in nature perish while almost no connected ramets die, successful production of ramets, at least in the short-term, make hybrids more fit than Fremont cottonwood and at least as fit as the narrowleaf cottonwood. Cot tonwood hybrid zones, which naturally occur wherever two or more species co-exist, are common along drainages throughout the western U.S., can be up to 1000km in length, and are thought to be very old. The demonstrated fitness of these trees is important to the conservation and restoration of riparian zones as hybrid trees support a higher biodiversity of arthropods and bird species than either pure species.

Soil CO2 efflux and soil CO2 profile concentrations under old growth tropical rain forest. Estimates of carbon fluxes in tropical forests are important in the current discussion on the world's carbon balance of forests. The main objectives of this study are (i) to present results on the soil CO2 efflux and soil CO2 concentration under old-growth tropical rainforest in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica and (ii) to describe the interactions between soil CO2 efflux, soil moisture content and soil temperature. We measured CO2 efflux from 48 soil chambers in six plots (covering Inceptisols and Ultisols) bi-weekly since March 1998 using an infrared CO2 analyzer. At the same time we measured soil CO2 concentrations at 5, 20, 40, 75, 150, 250 and 350 cm depth using a GC. At the Inceptisol sites, soil CO2 efflux rates ranged from 10.4 to 11.7 Mg C02-C ha-' yrl. Significantly higher flux rates occurred in the less fertile Ultisols where efflux rates ranged between 12.4 to 15.8 Mg CO2-C ha-' yr-'. When the volumetric soil moisture content of Incep tisols and Ultisols was &gt; 0.50 at 5 cm depth, there was a negative corre lation (r = -0.7) between soil CO2 efflux and soil moisture. Higher soil CO2 concentrations in the upper soil profile under moist conditions (up to 2 % in Inceptisols) supports the idea that higher soil moisture contents partially inhibit CO2 diffusion to the soil surface. The correlation between soil temperature at 5 cm depth and CO2 efflux was around r = 0.4. As there was also a correlation between soil moisture content and soil tem perature (r = -0.3) it was difficult to explain changes in soil CO2 efflux using these factors only. SCHWINNING, S. and J. R. EHLERINGER. University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112. Adaptations of desert plants to dynamic soil moisture conditions: An optimization result. We developed a model for plants in arid ecosystems to determine character combinations that would maximize whole-plant photosynthetic carbon gain under specific soil moisture conditions. The soil was divided into two com ponents, one with dynamic soil moisture, driven by rainwater input and evaporative depletion (shallow soil), and the other with constant soil mois ture (deeper soil). Soil conditions were varied by changing the frequency of rainwater input into the in the shallow soil and by setting different levels of deeper soil moisture. For each soil condition, we searched for an optimal combination of 8 morphological and physiological parameters, using a ge netic algorithm. We found that the level of deeper soil moisture led to the most profound changes in the plant's adaptive habit and physiology, while variation in rain frequency had a lesser effect. Stem succulence was adap tive when deeper soil moisture was unavailable and pulse frequency was relatively high. When pulse frequency was low, stem water storage char acteristics were closer to those of woody stems. Physiological control pa rameters, such as the response of leaf and root conductance to water po tential, interacted with whole-plant allocation patterns, above and below ground. Overall, the derived optimal phenotypes resembled those of rec ognized functional types of desert and semi-desert vegetation, suggesting that desert plants can be seen as specialists for the exploitation of specific soil moisture patterns.

Pollination ecology of claret-cup cactus across a latitude gradient: Effects of pollinator variation on floral characters. Studies of plant species along latitude gradients have sometimes found striking differences in animal visitors and floral traits that suggest adapta tion by populations to local pollinator conditions. We studied the visitors, nectar production and certain floral traits of claret cup cactus (Echinocereus coccineus, Cactaceae) along a latitude gradient from 320 N to 360 N in the southwestern U.S. We hypothesized: If pollinator type changes significantly across this gradient, we expect to also find floral traits adapted to this difference. Pollinator type did change, with large (7 g) Magnificent Hum mingbirds (Eugenes fulgens) present only south of 33o N, but smaller (3.5 Oral Presentation Abstracts 201</page><page sequence="163">g) Broad-Tailed Hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) present in all sites. Corresponding to this, we found that total flower length was signif icantly shorter where only small birds were present (45 mm in northern populations vs. 75 mm in the southern populations), and there was a non significant trend towards lower nectar production in northern populations, averaging 25 mg sugar/flower/day vs. 78 mg sugar/flower/day in southern populations.

Factors controlling carbon accu mulation in New Zealand secondary scrublands: Implications for the national carbon budget. In New Zealand, reversion of marginal agricultural land to secondary native woody vegetation is an important land-use change, and could influence the national carbon (C) budget. However, while several studies have examined factors controlling productivity and the C balance of mature forests, few studies have addressed these questions in native ecosystems accumulating C rapidly. We examined C and nitrogen (N) distribution in four age-se quences of vegetation dominated by manuka ( Leptospermum scoparium) and kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) at sites with varying climate and soil type. We also examined age-related variation in key factors controlling forest productivity and the whole-ecosystem C balance at one intensive site (stands of 25, 35, and 55-years-old) including N cycling, root C production/ allocation, and leaf area index. Across sites, maximum biomass C accu mulation ranged from 10 kg C m-2 to 19 kg C m-2 in stands 50-55 years old. Root biomass allocation varied little across sites, averaging about 15% of total biomass in spite of site differences in precipitation, temperature, and solar radiation. At our intensive site, leaf area index and canopy N concentration were lowest in the 25-year-old stand and highest in the 35 and 55-year-old stands, which did not differ (P=0.4). Root production and soil N availability did not vary significantly with stand age. We used these data to parameterize the BIOME-BGC model, which was then used (with national-scale climate and soils data) to predict C accumulation in these scrublands nationally. The BIOME-BGC model assesses carbon and nitro gen allocation to foliage, stems, roots, litter, and mineral soil, and was used to examine the major factors constraining C and N fluxes in these ecosys tems. From the modeling work, nutrient availability appears to limit C accumulation early in stand development more than climatic factors over larger spatial scales. Assuming a normal age-class distribution and about 1 million ha of area, these scrublands could accumulate about 1.8 Mt C y ',or about 20% of New Zealand's annual energy-derived CO2 emissions. SCOTT, M. C. and G. S. HELFMAN. University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602. A conceptual model for land-use effects on streams: Theory and application in the southern Blue Ridge. Landscapes are changing rapidly as expanding areas are appropriated for human uses, with particularly severe consequences for surface waters. Al though habitat alteration has long been recognized as a primary cause of decline in stream biological condition, only recently have the linkages be tween terrestrial conditions in the drainage basin and habitat conditions instream been examined. Life histories of native organisms are adapted to indigenous environmental regimes, so modified habitats may be outside physicochemical tolerance ranges or may alter outcomes of species inter actions. Results of these processes include altered community structure and species endangerment, signs of the worldwide biodiversity crisis. In the southern Appalachians, changes in fish assemblages are not indicated well by traditional measures such as richness or diversity indices. Historical ecology suggests that endemic species may be better indicators of stream quality in these highland systems. We hypothesized that geographically widespread, warm-water fishes would tend to replace highland endemics in more disturbed streams, where expected habitat changes included in creased temperature, nutrient concentrations, and sedimentation. We linked human activities to ecological effects by empirically fitting a nested hier archal model. We found that landscape features (primarily deforestation level) predicted 50-80% of variation in key habitat variables, and instream habitat predicted nearly 70% of variation in relative abundance of endemic and cosmopolitan fishes. Implementation of a watershed management pro gram based on such a model would make conservation a proactive, plan ning-oriented exercise rather than a reactive, crisis-oriented one. SEABLOOM, E. W.,' 0. J. REICHMAN' and E. J. GABET2 'National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 5504, U.S.A.; 2University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-5504, U.S.A. . The effect of hilislope angle on pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae). One way for animals to decrease energy expenditures is to minimize the cost of movement. For animals dwelling on slopes, gravity can impart a large energetic cost to movement. For this reason, animals traveling above ground alter their movement patterns in response to the steepness of terrain (specifically hillslope angle) so as to minimize their energetic costs. Sub terranean animals should also benefit from choosing optimum movement paths in relation to hillslopes but concurrently must factor the cost of ex cavation into their movement decisions. In cases where the excavation costs are much higher than the costs of working against gravity, excavation costs may override the consideration of gravitational costs and movement of subterranean animals may be independent of hillslope angle. To determine the response of a subterranean animal to hillslope angle, we excavated tunnels in the burrow systems of 19 pocket gophers in southern California that occupied hillslopes ranging from 2 - 300. At each excavation we mea sured several characteristics of burrow geometry and used these data in a model of pocket gopher energetics to calculate the cost of tunnel construc tion at the various hillslope angles. We found that the cost of tunnel con struction was independent of hillslope angle, and that the costs of shearing soil and pushing soil horizontally through the tunnels were three orders of magnitude greater than the costs of lifting the soil against the force of gravity. Accordingly, pocket gopher foraging tunnels were oriented inde pendently of the hillslope. The decoupling of the movement patterns of subterranean animals from the effects of gravity, is a distinctive feature of the subterranean habit compared to the movement of aboveground animals. Because of the important effects of tunnel construction on soil processes, this unique biological feature of subterranean animals has ramifications for basic physical processes, such as soil erosion. We found that pocket gopher activity resulted in a net uphill movement of soil on hillslopes of less than 8.90, and a net downhill movement on steeper slopes. This relationship is in contrast to the most common model of soil movement generated by purely physical processes. SEARS, M. W. and M. J. ANGILLETTA. University of Pennsylvania, Phil adelphia, PA 19104. The effect of water supplementation on hatchling growth in the sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus). Vertebrate ectotherms are a model system for demonstrating the effects of the environment on individual- and population-level processes. Generally, studies focus on the effects that the thermal and food resource environments exert on physiological processes and life history variation. However, there is little information regarding the effects that water availability exerts on the same processes. A few studies in vertebrate ectotherms suggest that increased water availability increases indiVidual growth rates. Two hypoth eses arise from these data: 1) increased water availability leads to increased growth efficiency, or 2) increased water availability compensates high wa ter loss rates, allowing increases in activity periods for behaviors such as foraging. This experiment tested the former hypothesis under controlled laboratory conditions. S. graciosus hatchlings were raised from gravid fe males collected from three study populations in southern UT. Hatchlings were fed an ad libidum diet and maintained on a 14-h light: 10-h dark cycle with temperatures at 32?C and 21?C respectively. Lizards were ran domly assigned to either a water supplementation treatment or a control group receiving no supplemental water. Water supplemented lizards were given a quantity of water orally once every five days equal to 1% of their body mass per day. Growth was quantified as the total change in body size for the duration of the 40-day experiment. Results do not support the hy pothesis for increased growth efficiency with increased water intake. Con trolling for food intake, there were no significant effects of site (p&lt; =0.47) or water treatment (p&lt; =0.43) on change in length. For mass gain, there was no significant site effect (p&lt; =0.35) but there was an increase attrib utable to water treatment (p&lt; =0.029). This effect translated to a mass gain of 0.08 g for water supplemented animals versus 0.02 g for control animals. 202 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="164">This magnitude of increase could not produce the variation in growth ob served between the natural study populations. This study suggests that growth responds similarly with regard to water supplementation or food availability irrespective of population origin, and the effects of water sup plementation are likely manifested through increases in activity time for lizards in natural populations.

Changes in plant community patterns under elements of global change. Using the reciprocal transplanting technique, we assessed changes in the patterns of productivity, diversity, plant composition and functional types in subalpine meadows from the Pyrenees under elements of Global Change. We transplanted 60 intact 40 by 40 by 20 cm monoliths from the meadows to the lowland; 60 additional monoliths remained in their original habitat. In the lowland, there was a temperature rise of about 10?C, a reduction in water input of about 50%, and a small increase of CO2. There was a sig nificant increase in plant biomass in the lowland compared to the subalpine. However, this increase was not homogeneously distributed among all the species. Although the six most abundant species were the same in both sites, they ranked differently, and, in the lowland, they broadened the dif ferences in biomass among them; as a general pattern, the dicot species augmented proportionally more than the grasses. Plant composition, species richness and diversity varied more strongly because of intra-seasonal tem poral changes than the transplanting treatment, but an episodic drought by the end of the growth season in the lowland decreased significantly plant diversity. Changes in the dominance of the species during the first growth season can have significant impacts in the trajectory of the system through time, with increases of dominance, decreases in plant diversity, and species extinctions, although the inertia of the community prevents some in the first year. These effects could be aggravated by punctual episodes of ex treme events. SEDLOCK, J. L. University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, U.S.A. Mechanisms of coexistence in Philippine bats. Within the framework of optimal foraging theory, I consider three mech anisms of coexistence that may contribute to the diversity of insectivorous bat communities. In the first, structural complexity among habitats provides the axis of environmental heterogeneity. Species can coexist along this axis if there is a trade-off in foraging efficiency among habitats. The second and third mechanisms involve the partitioning of the temporal and spatial variation in nightly insect abundance through a trade-off in maintenance and foraging efficiencies, and one in flight speed and foraging efficiencies. I tested these mechanisms in a Philippine insectivorous bat community within the Makiling Forest Reserve on Luzon Island. I monitored bat and insect activity along transects in three distinct and adjacent habitat types (forest, agro-forest and creek), during three time intervals over the course of 63 nights. I monitored bat activity with an Anabatll bat detector. Rhin olophids and Vespertilionds separated along an axis of habitat complexity, the former biasing its activity to more closed habitats and the latter in less cluttered habitats. Among the Vespertilionds, Myotis horsfieldii seemed to coexist with Myotis muricola and Pipistrellus javanicus by partitioning the spatial variance in insect abundance. The former foraged at higher eleva tions where insect abundance was lower, and the others coexisted at the rich patches through a trade-off in interference ability and foraging effi ciency along a temporal axis of insect abundance. Among the Rhinolophids in the forest, R. arcuatus and R. subrufus coexist via microhabitat selection, the former selecting perches in the cluttered understory and the latter se lecting subcanopy perches. The mechanism of coexistence approach has proven successful in elucidating bat community structure. By recognizing only the most salient environmental attributes that may promote coexis tence, one can identify the structure in even the most complex bat com munities. A further strength of this approach lies in its generality. These mechanisms may provide insights into the structure of not only other bat communities, but other taxa which are volant predators of a temporally and spatially dynamic prey. SEIDLER, T. G. and P. S. ASHTON. Harvard University, Cambridge MA 02138. Dispersal limitation influences spatial dispersion in rainforest tree populations. Dispersal limitation may be critical to understanding species coexistence and community dynamics in tropical forests. From analyses of tree distri butions within three 50ha plots in Southeast Asia, we have observed that a subset of tree species exhibited densely aggregated spatial distributions (on the scale of tens to hundreds of meters) independent of habitat structure. Nearly all species exhibiting pronounced aggregation had seeds dispersed by gravity or by ballistic dispersal. In order to determine whether dispersal limitation was sufficient to explain such aggregations, we first measured seed shadows of several species of ballistically dispersed shade tolerant trees from several genera of Euphorbiaceae at Pasoh Forest Reserve in Malaysia. Short convex dispersal curves suggested that dispersal distances more than Sm from the edge of the parent crown were rare. We used these data to model dispersal and replacement in tree populations, asking whether short dispersal distances would be sufficient to maintain aggregations over time. Simulations showed that maintenance of aggregation depended on short dispersal distances, but only under some mortality regimes. Density dependent mortality caused aggregations to become diffuse, while periodic mass mortality with few scattered survivors caused aggregations to re emerge. Thus, interactions between dispersal and mortality can affect spa tial structure in populations in ways that could alter local diversity and competitive interactions at the community level. SHAW, D.

Vertical organization of the small bird com munity in an old-growth Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest. The vertical organization of the small bird community (songbirds, small woodpeckers, nighthawks, and swifts) in a 500 year old Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest was quantified by the use of a construction crane (Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility). We used a gondola suspended from the crane to do a weekly series of vertically stratified point counts in the lower (0-20 m), mid (20-40 m) and upper (40-60+ m) canopy. Data is from March 21, 1996 to March 21, 1999, and included 121 survey days (average 40.3/yr). Chi Square Goodness of Fit test was used to determine if individual bird species were evenly distributed through the canopy (do numbers differ from random?). Analysis of Deviance using a poisson error structure and a log link, was used to determine the effect of season, canopy level, and their interaction for six abundant resident songbirds. The most birds, species, and guilds were detected in the upper canopy, whereas the Shannon-Weiner diversity index was equal for the low and upper canopy and slightly less for the mid canopy. Fifteen species, of the twenty most common, were detected significantly more often in one zone of the canopy, while five species were not. Timber foliage insectivores, air insectivores, and timber seed eaters all stratify the canopy, as do most low understory herbivore-insectivores. Bark insectivores and omnivore-scavengers tend not to stratify the canopy. The Chestnut-backed Chickadee (p = 0.0000), Brown Creeper (p = 0.0002), Red Crossbill (p = 0.0049), and Gray Jay (p = 0.0360) all shift canopy levels with the seasons, whereas the Golden crowned Kinglet (p = 0.0660) and Winter Wren (p = 0.7997) do not.

The effects of global change on belowground car bon storage: Under elevated CO2, increased N-deposition does not lead to increased C storage in a California grassland. At the Jasper Ridge Integrated Global Change Experiment (JRI-GCE), we evaluated the effects of global change on belowground C inputs, soil res piration, and the contribution of newly-fixed C to soil C efflux. The field experiment implemented a full factorial combination of 2 levels of CO2 (360 and 700 ppm), temperature (ambient and ambient + 2?C), nitrogen deposition (ambient and +7 g (N) in-2), and precipitation (ambient and ambient + 50%). Because C fixed in the elevated CO2 plots had a distinct Oral Presentation Abstracts 203</page><page sequence="165">isotopic signature, we used these plots to distinguish between sources of C to soil respiration signature. We used 5-point Keeling plots to determine the isotopic signature of soil respiration and to partition the sources of respiration between C fixed during the first growing season of the treatment application ("new C") versus that derived from decomposition of soil or ganic matter produced in years prior. The isotopic signature of respiration from the control plots was -27.9 ppmil, matching the 13C of plant inputs ( 28.2 ppmil). The signature of elevated CO2 plots varied from -34 to -40 ppmil. At the beginning of the 2nd growing season, we evaluated treatment effects on soil respiration and the proportional contribution of new C to soil respiration as well as on the absolute rate of soil respiration. These measurements were made within a week of the first rain so they reflect only microbial decomposition without any root respiration. Total respiration was higher under all N deposition treatments but did change with any of the other treatments. In addition, isotopic values indicated that a greater proportion of the respiration was derived from new C under N deposition: New C made up 65-75% of soil respiration in the nitrogen treatments and about 55% in the CO2, CO2 + water and CO2 + warming treatments. At peak belowground biomass of the first growing season of treatment appli cation, root density was higher in all N-deposition treatments. Many studies have hypothesized that C sequestration may be enhanced when a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is accompanied by increased N deposition. In this study, however, the increased belowground plant inputs were accompanied by a subsequent increase in C flux from the soil under N-deposition. Under a 2 fold increase in atmospheric CO2, there may be little new storage of C despite N stimulation of plant inputs. SHEA, K.,12 T. WOODBURN2 and A.

We present a seasonal, individual-based model for nodding thistle. The model structure and parameters are based on data from a long term field study of mapped individuals. We use this model to ask what life history properties make nodding thistle a successful invader, and hence what we can do to manage it. The results of our simulations indicate that individual variability, in particular in growth rates, strongly increases pop ulation persistence. We also found that persistence is affected more strongly by survivorship and adult growth than by germination or fecundity rates.

Estimating dormancy and survival of a rare her baceous perennial using mark-recapture models. Mark-recapture statistics have been used predominantly to analyze animal populations, yet their application can be extended to the estimation of plant demographic traits in cases where conventional methods are inadequate. We applied open population mark-recapture models incorporating maxi mum likelihood techniques to estimate annual probabilities of dormancy (d) and apparent survival (PHI) of the small yellow lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus ssp. parviflorum (Salisb.) Fernald), a long-lived, threatened plant that experiences an adult dormant stage that can bias sur vival estimates. The aboveground states of 548 genets in eight patches were monitored over five years. Dormancy periods of one or two years were most commonly observed, although dormancy periods as long as four years were also observed. The best-fit model suggested that apparent survival was constant throughout the study for all patches, while dormancy varied additively with time among patches. The probability of dormancy was 0.320 ? 0.024 on average, with a maximum bias of 0.067 as calculated using an estimate of the probability of detection. Mean apparent survival probabilities were high in each patch (PHI = 0.878) but dormancy prob abilities varied considerably among patches (range: 0.188 to 0.672). Con ventional resprouting probabilities underestimated apparent survival by an average difference of 0.288 (range: 0.150 to 0.589). This novel application of mark-recapture statistics to plant demography allowed robust survival estimates that accounted for uncertainty due to an unobservable, dormant life stage. SHENG HU, F,1 W.

Geomorphic and climatic controls over Holocene soil development in the arctic foothills of Alaska. Quaternary glacial advances resulted in several geomorphic units of con trasting soil and vegetation within a similar regional climate in the arctic foothills of northern Alaska. Red Green Lake (RG; 680 39' N, 1490 41' W) represents a young land surface (&lt;15,000 years old) exposed by re cession of the last glacial episode, whereas Upper Capsule Lake (UC; 68? 38' N, 1490 25' W) represents an old surface (&gt;500,000 years old) ungla ciated during the late Quaternary. We analyzed sediment cores from these two lakes for a suite of organic and inorganic geochemical indicators to assess Holocene soil development in relation to climatic and geomorphic variation. Overall the atomic ratios of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) and total concentrations of lignin-derived phenolic compounds (Lambda) are greater for UC than for RG, suggesting that the UC sediments are more enriched in terrestrial organic matter than those of RG. This difference probably reflects greater carbon fluxes from soil and vegetation within the UC wa tershed and higher aquatic productivity within RG Lake. At RG, increases in the content of organic carbon (OC%), C:N ratio, and Lambda together suggest that soil OC accumulation occurred gradually between 7000 and 2500 yr BP. The watershed soils of RG were mineral-rich prior to 7000 yr BP and organic-rich after 2500 yr BP A marked increase in the Fe:Mn ratio of the RG sediments suggests that the onset of organic matter accu mulation at 7000 yr BP was caused by the development of waterlogged, sub-oxic conditions that retarded the degradation of soil organic matter. Within the UC watershed, soil carbon storage probably also increased be tween 9000 yr BP and the late Holocene, as indicated by a doubling of sedimentary OC that is mainly of terrestrial origin. However, in contrast to RG, high OC% values, C:N ratios, and lignin-phenol concentrations at UC suggest that soils within the UC watershed were most likely organic-rich throughout the Holocene. The Fe:Mn ratios of the UC sediment core are relatively high without any stratigraphic variation, suggesting that water logged conditions existed throughout the Holocene. A regional climatic cooling ca. 7000 yr BP resulted in much greater edaphic alterations at RG than at UC, implying that sensitivity to climate forcing differs between the two geomorphic units represented by these two lakes.

The northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides) as an organizer of alpine ecosystem and plant community structure. We identify the northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides) as a keystone engineer in the alpine tundra of Niwot Ridge, Colorado, by virtue of its control over biogeochemistry, biodiversity, and vegetative community structure. The term keystone species, used to identify a unique and/or im portant species to the structure or function of its ecological system, has been criticized as vague and difficult to quantify. It is nonetheless a useful concept and we propose that designating a keystone organism is equally dependent on the explicit identification of the species' environment as on identification of the species itself. Keystone status is therefore a function of an organism's relationship with its resident ecosystem, which the north ern pocket gopher exemplifies in Colorado's alpine tundra. Pocket gopher disturbances induce long-term erosion of soil mass, carbon, and nitrogen, thereby modifying local microtopography and nutrient distribution. Further, we have identified a potentially interdependent relationship between the pocket gopher and the forb growth form, both of which are most concen trated in the alpine moist meadows: Gopher disturbances suppress grami noids and cushion plants, whereas forbs are the most resilient to the above ground disturbance. Trends in species richness following gopher distur bance were a function of scale, where mesoscale richness is positively correlated with disturbance and microscale richness is negatively correlat ed. 204 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="166">SHIMA, J. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA USA. Population regulation without density dependence? Decoupling density- and num ber-dependent sources of mortality for a coral reef fish. Population ecologists have traditionally targeted population density (i.e., number per unit area) and its influence on demographic rates (density dependence) as the primary mechanism contributing to the regulation of local populations. However, behavioral ecologists who typically focus on individuals have noted that behavior patterns (e.g., time spent foraging) can vary with group size, independent of local patch size. These observations indicate that group size, independent of population density may influence vital demographic rates and contribute to the regulation of local popula tions. I used a factorial experiment to explore the separate and joint effects of density and group size on mortality rates of newly settled coral reef fish (six bar wrasse, Thalassoma hardwicke) resident on small patch reefs. Losses of wrasses over 7 days depended on density and group size, as fish at higher densities and in groups disappeared from patch reefs more than fish that were solitary on reefs and at lower densities. Losses increased by - 30% when densities were increased from 0.25 fish / m2 to 0.5 fish / M2. Similarly, losses increased by - 45% when group size was increased from 1 to 2 individuals per patch. Results suggest group size independent of patch size (i.e., density-independent interactions) may contribute to regu lation of local populations. Overall, this work highlights a greater need to consider group size effects in addition to density effects when exploring sources of population regulation. SHLISKY, A. J. and B. ALLEN-DIAZ. University of California, Berkeley, USA. Vegetation dynamics in meadows of the Sierra Nevada, Califor nia. Understanding the complex patterns and processes of vegetation change requires empirically-based induction from an understanding of local habi tats, populations, and disturbance regimes, rather than deduction from broad generalizations about successional processes. In the past, many have assumed, based on Clementsian views of succession, that meadow ecosys tems grazed by livestock resiliently return toward climax after removal of livestock, or after stocking rate reduction, and conversely retrogress toward early seral stages with increased grazing pressure. We used a 40-year per manent vegetation plot record of sixteen meadows on the Tahoe and Sierra National Forests, California, and associated environmental data to develop a floristically-based classification of meadow communities, and determine important relationships between environmental variables and meadow type transitions through time. Each meadow-year observation was associated with 10 environmental variables. Community types from 81 plots were defined using TWINSPAN. Meadow community types were separated along environmental and grazing intensity gradients using detrended cor respondence analysis (DCA), classification and regression tree analysis (CART), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Community clas sification resulted in five meadow types. A regional pattern appeared in community types based on minimum annual air temperatures, separating types found on the Tahoe versus the Sierra National Forests. Most between type transitions were associated with precipitation, snow water content, and duration of livestock use. Shifts in livestock intensity through time tended to be associated with within-type changes in species composition or abun dance, but were not strongly correlated with transitions between meadow types. Results of this study fail to support a linear model of meadow change considering grazing alone. Differences in environmental variables impor tant at the regional versus local scales highlight the need to evaluate the consistency between the scale of community identification and the choice of associated environmental factors. SHOLES, 0. D. V. Assumption College, Worcester, MA 01609 USA. In fluence of cold weather on the abundance of pinyon pine sawflies. Larvae of the sawfly Neodiprion edulicolus feed on needles of Pinus edulis (pinyon pine) during April in northern Arizona, USA. I censused the abun dance of sawflies at two elevations (1740 m and 1830 m) between 1994 1999. Even though competition and predation can cause significant sawfly mortality, severe weather can overwhelm these biotic effects and cause abrupt population declines. Abundance in 1999 fell to 3% of the previous low, and throughout the six-year census period there was a significant effect of cold April weather on sawfly abundance. Change in abundance (ln N t+1 - ln N t) was significantly correlated (df = 3) with maximum consecutive days of snow (r = -.953 at 1740 m; r = -.944 at 1830 m; P &lt; .02), with amount of snowfall (r = -.994 at 1740 m; P &lt; .01), and with lowest temperature (r = .964 at 1830 m; P &lt; .02). If climate change increases the amount of severe weather and/or the variance of temperature and precipitation, abiotic effects may become more significant in popula tion fluctuation, especially for insects and other poikilotherms.

Sedimentary evidence for climate change during the late-glacial and early Holocene in New England can be compared with fossil pollen records to examine the response of vegetation to climate change. Here, we use loss on-ignition records from several small, closed kettle lakes to confirm cli matic cooling in New England during the Younger Dryas chronozone (13,000-11,000 cal yr B.P). Also, sedimentary evidence, provided from transects of cores, show that after the Younger Dryas chronozone, water levels fell at many sites in New England. We interpret these data to mean that conditions became warmer and drier between 11,000 and 8,000 cal yr B.P., followed by relatively moist conditions by 7,000 cal yr B.P The sed imentary record, therefore, documents a series of climatic changes: 1) cool ing at 13,000 cal yr B.R, 2) warming and drying at 11,000 cal yr B.P, and 3) an increase in moisture availability after 8,000 cal yr B.P The fossil pollen data illustrate vegetation responses to these climatic changes. The result is a climatic basis for the well-documented shifts, from Picea to Pinus, and then Quercus, in the dominant pollen types of the New England pollen zones. These climatic changes also likely influenced the arrival and expansion of Fagus, Tsuga, and other New England plant taxa, and im pacted local ecosystems by, at least, changing the hydrology. By docu menting the relationship between ecosystem dynamics and climate changes in New England between 14,000 and 7,000 cal yr B.P, we can provide a case study useful to conservation efforts ongoing in the face of future climate changes. SHURIN, J. B. University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. Interactive effects of dispersal and predation on pond zooplankton communities. Theory suggests that predators can have variable effects on prey species composition, diversity, and trophic structure at local and regional scales. The consequences of invasion or extinction of a predator may depend on the traits of species in the regional pool and their rates of dispersal among habitats. I tested the effects of introduction of fish and insect predators on experimental zooplankton communities that were either connected to or isolated from the regional species pool. Predators had negative effects on local zooplankton diversity in the absence of dispersal and positive effects when immigration was allowed. Fish facilitated invasion by species that were excluded in their absence. The effects of predators on zooplankton size structure and phytoplankton biomass were independent of the dispersal treatment. Invasion by species from the region compensated for the loss of species diversity due to predation, but not for the ecosystem functions performed by those species. The results suggest that predators promote regional diversity and have variable effects on local diversity depending on how quickly ponds approach biogeographic equilibrium with respect to the regional species pool.

Insect herbivores caused signifi cantly greater damage to untreated C. laevigata than to untreated S. sebi ferum but the removal of insect herbivores caused significantly greater in creases in survivorship and growth for S. sebiferum than for C. laevigata. This suggests that greater chronic insect herbivory on natives does not facilitate the invasion of this alien species. SIEVERING, H. S.,' T KELLY,' G. MCCONVILLE' and A.

Atmospheric nitrogen loading at a Rocky Mountain conifer forest: Perturbation of the natural nitrogen cycle and potential carbon storage enhancement. Dry deposition of gaseous nitric acid (HNO3) at a 3000m subalpine spruce, fir, and pine forest site on Niwot Ridge was measured during the growing season of 1999. The dry deposition velocity for HNO3 was found to be quite large, 5 to 9 cm s-l (90% CI), indicating it is the single most im portant contributor to total atmospheric nitrogen (TN) loading at this site. TN loading is enhanced several-fold over natural nitrogen loading by sum mertime afternoon mountain upslope flow which brings Colorado Front Range pollution nitrogen to the site. Growing season (May-October) nitro gen loading is estimated to be doubled by this pollution nitrogen deposition. The accumulation of nitrogen by this conifer forest may significantly per turb the natural forest nitrogen cycle at this site. Given that conifer foliage nitrogen content is generally &lt; 1% of dry wt., the potential for pollution derived nitrogen to stimulate added forest growth is high. SIGUENZA, C., E. B. ALLEN, M.

Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition is a problem in Southern California, as is the invasion of Mediterranean annual grasses into the local coastal sage scrub (CSS) vegetation. This study was carried out to determine the effect of these changes on soil microbial communities. Soils were sampled in several sites under exotic grasses and under Artemisia californica a native shrub, along a N deposition gradient. Microbial abundance was assessed by measuring active fungal hyphae and bacteria on soil samples stained with europium chelate. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were extracted from soils and their profiles were used to describe soil microbial commu nity differences along the gradient. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spores were extracted and counted and roots from Artemisia californica and exotic grasses stained by standard methods to evaluate colonization. Microbial abundance showed no differences in the first year of sampling but in the second year the sites with high N levels were more bacterial dominated while the sites with lower N were fungal dominated. Principal components analysis of FAME profiles showed defined clusters representing sites along the gradient in both years. The differences in FAME profiles between soils under A. californica and under exotic grasses are not clear in all the sites, probably because exotic grasses have invaded the understory of most shrubs all along the gradient. However, N deposition is affecting the com position of the soil microbial communities. Mycorrhizal spore number and colonization was affected by the N gradient. Sites with high levels of N had fewer spores or less colonization than sites with lower N levels. In several sites, the spore numbers were significantly higher under A. califor nica than under exotic grasses. In CSS the high soil N levels and the vegetation shift were negatively affecting the microbial community. SILVER, W. L.,' A. E. LUGO,2 L. M. KUEPPERS' and V. MATZEK.'

Rates of aboveground biomass gain, and soil carbon accumulation and loss 60 years following tropical reforestation. High rates of tropical deforestation have prompted growing concern about the loss of C storage capacity, and increasing rates of C emissions to the atmosphere. Considerable recent efforts have focused on documenting the effects of deforestation and land use change on plant and soil C pools. Much less research has explored possible mechanisms to help offset C losses through reforestation. In this study, we use 1' C analyses and forest inventories to quantify rates of soil and plant C accumulation in a sub tropical moist forest 60 years following restoration of forest from pasture. We also measured the effects of species richness, composition, and basal area density on rates of C accumulation, litterfall and fine root production in the restored ecosystem. Species richness had increased to 75 in 1991 from the original 13 species that were planted. Total aboveground biomass was 158 Mg/ha, and accumulated at a rate of 2.92 (? 0.10) Mg/ha/yr. Most tree species, including early successional species, grew faster during the second 32 years of growth than in the first 22 years. There was no affect of species richness on above- or belowground productivity. Native species had the highest importance values, and accumulated aboveground C at the fastest rates. Three non-native timber species were among the 10 species with the greatest aboveground biomass for the forest. Litterfall net primary productivity (NPP) was 12.9 ? 0.7 Mg/ha/yr, and fine root productivity was 0.2 Mg/ha/yr. Litterfall NPP was high relative to other tropical moist forests. Belowground C pools were greater in the forest (99.5 ? 1.6) than in adjacent pasture of similar age (68.8 ? 9.0). Forest soil C accumulated at rate of approximately 1 Mg C/ha/yr, but residual pasture C was lost at a rate 0.3 Mg C/ha/yr, yielding a net gain of 37 Mg C/ha in the forest soil over the 60 year period. Our results suggest that restored tropical moist forests can be an important sink for both above- and belowground C. The choice of species used for reforestation is likely to affect rates and patterns of C sequestration through species-specific traits that influence C allocation patterns, litter quality, or alteration of microclimate and edaphic conditions.

Global changes influence woody in vasion of a California annual grassland. Nonlinear changes in ecosystem structure and function, such as changes in vegetation type, could be dominant components of ecosystem responses to anthropogenic global changes. Global climate and atmospheric changes have been postulated as drivers of one such shift occurring on at least four continents: The invasion of grasslands by woody shrubs. We exposed 0.79 m2 field plots in a California annual grassland to eight replicates of all 16 possible combinations of ambient and elevated CO2 (700 ppm), temperature (+1-2?C), precipitation (+50%), and N deposition (+7g/ m2/yr) for two years. In year 1, we followed the survival of shrub seedlings transplanted into field plots after greenhouse germination. In year 2, we followed the germination, survival, and growth of shrubs introduced into the plots as seeds. We chose Baccharis pilularis var. consanguinea, a native shrub that advances episodically into exotic-dominated California grasslands. Elevat ed CO2 and elevated precipitation both led to earlier B. pilularis germi nation and both exerted strong positive effects on shrub seedling survival into the annual summer dry season. Precipitation had only a slightly stron ger effect than elevated C02; the effects of the two treatments were ad ditive. N deposition, in contrast, exerted a strong negative effect on seed ling survival through the period of drought onset (May-July soil moisture decline) and negated the positive effects of elevated precipitation and CO2. Warming significantly reduced germination rates but did not influence seed ling survival during drought onset. Moisture availability during the period of drought onset appears to be the key mechanism linking global changes to altered B. pilularis encroachment. Weekly soil moisture measurements taken for the duration of the study indicate that soil moisture during the period of drought onset increased in response to increased precipitation and elevated C02, and decreased in response to N deposition. This is the first study that we know of to address experimentally the mechanisms linking multiple global changes to woody invasion of grasslands. SIMONSON, S.,' G. W. CHONG'2 and T. J.

Exotic plant species and native pollinators: Implications for native biodiversity. In a landscape-scale biodiversity assessment in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, areas richest in both butterfly and vascular plant species 206 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="168">overlapped with areas of exotic plant species invasion. Many butterflies and other nectar feeders are attracted to flowers of exotic species such as musk thistle, Carduus nutans Linnaeus, and Canada thistle, Cirsium ar vense Linnaeus. Coincident patterns may simply reflect the distribution of resources, but both native plants and butterflies could be negatively im pacted if these flower visitors are effective pollinators. When butterflies drink nectar of exotic thistle species they may also pollinate, contributing to invasion success. Although the vegetative underground system has been implicated in its weediness, the flowers of Cirsium arvense are insect pol linated. Furthermore, evidence suggests pollinator limitation in many native plant species. Exotic thistles may draw visitors away from native thistles thus leading to their decline. As exotic plant species invade a site, native plant species may be both competitively displaced and "robbed" of polli nator services. Although a particular butterfly species may utilize a wide variety of nectar plants as an adult, it may be limited to one or a few closely related larval host plants. Butterfly populations may decline because even though adults can use nectar from exotics, gravid females may be unable to locate their native host plants. There is some controversy con cerning the importance of butterflies as pollinators. If flower visitors are not effective pollinators, exotic thistles may simply provide additional re sources for butterflies. It is also possible that they serve as an attractant that could facilitate pollination in nearby native plant species. Further re search into these systems is critical as exotic species invasions and polli nator ecology are high priority issues in conservation biology. SINGSAAS, E. L.,I D. R. ORT12 and E. H.

The relationship between mesophyll conductance and photosynthetic acclimation to elevated Co2. Photosynthetic acclimation is often defined by parameters calculated from photosynthetic CO2 response curves. These calculations depend on knowl edge of the CO2 concentration inside the chloroplast, Cc, but in absence of that information the leaf airspace CO2 concentration, Ci, is used. Mesophyll conductance, g, is needed to calculate C. from Ci. Our objective was to determine whether elevated CO2 affects g.. in trees and to determine how potential changes affect estimates of photosynthetic acclimation. Using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we measured gm on Populus tre muloides and Liquidambar styraciflua trees growing at 360 and 560 pLL L ' CO2 at two FACE sites. Mesophyll conductance increased in elevated CO2 by 11% in P. tremuloides and 26% in L. styraciflua. It was positively correlated with light-saturated photosynthesis rates. Using the g.. values determined for these trees, we analyzed the photosynthetic CO2 response of trees at each FACE site and determined that estimates of acclimation changed by as much as 30%. We conclude that gm changes proportionally with photosynthesis and should be considered when determining photosyn thetic acclimation to CO2 treatments. SISK, T. D.,' B. R. NOON2 and H. M. HAMPTON.'

Terrestrial landscapes are being converted to novel states at increasing rates, due to accelerating human land use and its impacts. Remaining natural habitats are more fragmented and are often embedded in anthropogenic habitat types. Given this degree of dynamism, an approach for estimating changes in population density and viability that explicitly accounts for changes in the spatial patterning of habitats in the landscapes is essential. In addition to simple abundance responses, estimates should account for time lags and unexpected transient dynamics that accompany landscape change. We discuss a spatial modeling approach that incorporates empirical data on animal edge responses and predicts changes in animal abundance and distribution under various land management scenarios. In addition to typical patch size, shape, and distribution metrics, this model explicitly incorporates information on patch context. Inputs to the model include habitat maps and animal density response functions. Each response function describes animal density in terms of a probability distribution along a hab itat gradient stretching between the interiors of adjacent habitat types. Pre liminary model results show marked differences from the predictions of a null model that does not incorporate edge and matrix effects. Predictions of bird densities in a heterogeneous desert riparian ecosystem differ by factors of 0.6-2.7, and differences between predictions of the effective area model and null model tend to increase with increasing landscape hetero geneity.

Effect of afforestation on aggregation and particulate organic matter carbon. It is generally assumed that afforestation will lead to a sequestration of carbon. However, the processes resulting in a sequestration of carbon in afforested soils are still elusive. We hypothesized that the increase in ag gregation with afforestation would lead to a higher physical protection and consequently an accumulation of carbon. At three sites in Ohio, forest, afforested and cultivated soils were sampled by horizon. Light, heavy and total particulate organic matter C (LPOM, HPOM, TPOM) were deter mined by dispersion and density floatation. Four aggregate size classes were separated by wet sieving and analyzed for organic C. At all sites, organic C concentration increased with increased aggregate size. At two of the three sites, LPOM of the A- horizon increased in the order: cultivated &lt; afforested &lt; forested. However, HPOM counterbalanced the increase in LPOM at one of these two sites. Consequently, we observed at only one site a higher total POM C concentration in the afforested soil than the agricultural soil. In contrast, in the A-horizon of all sites, we observed higher proportions of large macroaggregates in afforested soils compared to cultivated soils. These data indicate that afforestation leads to an increase in structural stability, but that this structural stability does not always result in a sequestration of particulate organic matter C.

Linking avian communities, riparian vegetation, and geomorphology along a prairie river, USA. The structure of riparian bird communities depends on various habitat and landscape characteristics. Two important processes that influence riparian vegetation in the American west are plant establishment and succession on new stream deposits, and livestock herbivory. We examined how bird spe cies composition and abundance varied along 172 km of the upper Missouri River, a large, flow-regulated, geomorphically-constrained stream in central Montana. We sampled breeding bird abundance and vegetation structure in 34 sample sites that included three habitat types. We related geomorphic activity since 1953 and grazing history to the existing riparian vegetation, thus connecting these processes to bird community structure via vegetation structure and landscape character of habitat. We used several univariate and multivariate analysis to define and test the above relations. Vegetation structure was most strongly related to bird abundance, while landscape character was poorly related. Many bird species representing several for aging guilds were strongly associated with and occurred in greater densities in forest stands of complex structure, whereas only a few bird species were denser in forest stands with no understory. The linkage between riverine processes, riparian vegetation, and avian communities holds strong impli cations for long-term avian conservation efforts. SKELLY, D. K.' and J. M.

Design and outcome in ecological experiments: An analysis of tadpole density manipulations. An ecologist conducting an experiment must make a series of choices re garding its design. Among these, the choice of experimental venue ranks as among the most critical. The decision to experiment in the laboratory, in mesocosms, or in the field has been postulated to constrain other aspects of design and to influence outcome. Relative to field manipulations, ma nipulations in the laboratory or in mesocosms are thought to allow more complicated designs, greater precision among replicates and a higher de gree of replication. However, it has been argued that despite these draw backs, field experiments may be particularly valuable because of their pre sumed advantages in extrapolation to understanding natural populations. Oral Presentation Abstracts 207</page><page sequence="169">We evaluated designs and outcomes from 52 studies aimed at quantifying the impact of density on the growth of larval anurans. Contrary to expec tations, we found that there was little evidence that experimental venue influenced design complexity or precision among replicates. However, lab oratory experiments tended to have moderately greater numbers of repli cates. In a meta-analysis of growth responses we determined that experi mental outcomes were strongly related to venue. While most manipulations tended to yield effects consistent with competition, those conducted in the field tended to yield more moderate effects. As an example, interspecific manipulations in mesocosms were associated with effect sizes an order of magnitude larger than those from field manipulations. Taken together, our results from tadpole experiments suggest that the tradeoffs presumed to flow from the choice of venue may be more moderate than expected, while the impact of venue on experimental outcome may be quite large. We believe that such analyses will be useful as ecologists work to improve experimental methods and to expand their inferential power. SLABBEKOORN, H., ' J.

Sound transmission in tropical forests: Bird song convergence through habitat exploitation. Animal vocalizations that are used for long distance communication are shaped by acoustic properties of the environment. Bird communities living in dense tropical forests show convergence in their species-specific songs, which is reflected in general acoustic design features. Thirty years of re search on the relationship between sound transmission and signal design yielded a huge body of literature, focusing on habitat induced limitations due to signal attenuation and degradation. However, part of the signal de sign of forest birds may not be explained by limitations, but by hitherto overlooked beneficial effects of reverberations. Typical narrow frequency bandwidth notes ('NFB notes') are the principle elements of the acoustic design for bird song in dense tropical forest. These notes contrast with frequency modulated notes, typical for many other closely related species, which do not live in dense undergrowth. We examined the impact of trans mission on these NFB notes in dense tropical forest in Cameroon, Africa. We used acoustic analyses of bird song recordings, transmission experi ments with artificial sound stimuli, and playback experiments. We show that the change in acoustic characteristics after transmission is qualitatively and quantitatively different for NFB notes, compared with frequency mod ulated notes. The difference is caused by the constant frequency of the notes, and leads to a relative increase in efficiency after transmission through dense foliage. Our data provide evidence for that the evolutionary convergence into song with NFB notes for many unrelated bird species, may be explained not so much by habitat induced limitations, but rather by exploitation of the transmission properties. SLINGSBY, D. British Ecological Society. Long-term studies of a Shet land serpentine site. The Shetland Islands lie in the north Atlantic 200km north of the British mainland. The Keen of Hamar is a serpentine (ultramafic) outcrop with substantial expanses of sparsely vegetated debris and a distinctive glacial relict flora. In this presentation a 30 year study is described including pop ulation dynamics of debris plant species, nutrient addition experiments, successional studies, grazing exclosures amd studies of erosion rates. The outcomes included consideration of underlying ecological processes and conservation issues. It appears that succession on the sparsely colonised debris is almost totally retarded and that the effects of human interference are temporary. Despite looking unstable this is probably one of the most stable and most ancient habitats in Britain, little changed since the last glaciation ended. SLOAN, S. A.

The effect of water availability on growth, reproduction, and mortality in Plumeria alba: A field experiment in the dry forest of Puerto Rico. This experiment was designed to determine the degree to which a tropical dry forest tree is limited by the amount and seasonality of water avail ability. This study was conducted in the Guanica Forest Reserve, Puerto Rico, where annual rainfall averages 762 mm and December and April are the driest months. To determine the effect of water availability on Plumeria alba, 8 trees were watered with 19 L of water/tree/month in addition to normal rainfall for a period of 12 months. Results from these trees were compared to 8 control trees receiving normal rainfall and an additional 8 trees in which water availability was reduced by surrounding trees with a plastic sheet 3 m in diameter. Water-limited trees reflushed fewer leaves following the dry season and had higher mortality (75%) compared to either control trees (0%) or trees receiving additional water (0%). Follow ing the dry season, the standing crop of leaves on control trees exceeded that of watered trees due to increased herbivory by sphinx moth larvae. High levels of herbivory caused watered trees to produce significantly few er flowers and initiate fewer fruit compared to control and water-limited trees. Increased water availability had a significant positive effect on leaf ing. However, the increase in the number of leaves on watered trees did not translate into an increase in fecundity or growth due to higher rates of herbivory. SLOCUM, M., J. K. ZIMMERMAN and T AIDE. University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR 00936. Restoration of tropical wet forest in the Ebano Verde Scientific Reserve, Dominican Republic. In many parts of the tropics, deforestation, burning, and erosion result in areas dominated by ferns in the genus Dicronopteris. We have been inves tigating mechanisms of fern dominance and methods for restoring native wet tropical forest in deforested areas of the Ebano Verde Scientific Re serve, located in the central highlands of the Dominican Republic. Using nearby riparian forest as a source of seedlings of native species, we are performing experiments and trial plantings to see which species are capable of readily establishing on deforested, fern-dominated hillslopes that have been experimentally cleared of ferns. In addition, we are testing the use of chicken manure from a nearby commercial chicken farm as a source of fertilizer to overcome any nutrient limitations on tree growth. A two-way factorial experiment comparing soils from fern-dominated vs. riparian areas and monthly manure additions on the growth of 14 species of shrub and tree indicated that growth was increased in riparian soils and when seed lings were fertilized. However, fertilization increased plant mortality in most species. Trial plantings of seedlings of 18 species into fern-cleared areas were highly successful, with all species exhibiting high survivorship and positive growth during the first three months. A one-time application of manure at the time of planting did not, in general, significantly affect the plants positively or negatively. SMALL, C. J. and B. C. MCCARTHY.

Clearcut harvesting alters forest composition by removing reservoirs of species diversity and modifying environmental and edaphic conditions. To better understand the effects of this management disturbance on central Appalachian deciduous forests, we examined the composition, diversity, and site conditions of mature second-growth stands in the understory rein itiation phase (UR; &gt; 125 yr) relative to regenerating clearcuts in the stand initiation phase (SI; -7 yr). Tree, sapling, and understory and microenvi ronmental data were collected in 250, 25, and 2.5 m2 plots, respectively. Disturbance strongly influenced upper vegetation strata and microenviron mental conditions. Tree and sapling richness and density were significantly greater and tree basal area lower in SI than UR (P &lt; 0.001). Light avail ability, temperature, and soil compaction were greater in SI (P &lt; 0.001). Edaphic conditions were strongly correlated with slope aspect, with greater soil moisture and nutrient availability on mesic SI and intermediate UR sites (P K 0.01). Distribution of herbs and woody seedlings was also in fluenced by aspect, with increased richness and abundance of herbs on intermediate sites and seedlings on xeric sites (P &lt; 0.05). Our results em phasize the relationship between site quality characteristics and disturbance response, particularly in lower forest strata. The individualistic response of forest strata to site quality and disturbance underscores the importance of understanding management impacts on all strata, across the range of site conditions in central Appalachian forests. 208 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="170">SMITH, C.

The response of fine roots to nutrient additions in disturbed black spruce ecosystems. The black spruce ecosystems in central Quebec are highly disturbed by fire and harvesting, yet little is known about soil nutrient dynamics and plant productivity following anthropogenic or natural disturbance in these sys tems. To evaluate the response of tree and shrub fine roots to additions of three nutrients, we installed a root-ingrowth core experiment in recently burned and harvested stands (&lt; ten years) and in stands that were cut or burned over 50 years ago. The cores were filled with root-free organic material collected from soils under replicated black spruce stands, treated with nutrient solutions (Ca, N, or P), and placed in the top 10 cm of the soil at each of the 12 stands (4 disturbance types by 3 replicates). At each of the stands, 24 cores were installed, and the cores were harvested after 4.5 months in the field (May to October). After their extraction, the con centrations of exchangeable Ca, extractable P, and NH4+ in the treated cores were 40-95% higher than in the untreated (control) cores. Preliminary anal yses indicate that cores placed in the recently harvested stands (all nutrient treatments) had higher fine root length (220-240 cm/cm3) and biomass (602 - 794 g/m2) compared to the other disturbance types. The calcium treated cores had the highest fine root length in each of the disturbance types, suggesting that Ca may limit productivity in these sites. SMITH, S. M., S. NEWMAN, J. A.

Effects of above- and below-ground fire on soil properties and cattail growth potential in a northern Everglades marsh. The effects of surface- and muck-fire on soils from a hydrologically-altered Everglades marsh were investigated by chemical analysis and bioassay. Muck fire resulted in losses of total carbon, nitrogen, and organic forms of phosphorus (P) while inorganic P and calcium (Ca) were significantly el evated. Muck fire also resulted in greatly increased vertical heterogeneity in concentrations of Ca, total P, and inorganic P between the upper (0-2 cm) and lower (2-10 cm) soil layers. In contrast, surface-fire had only a minor enrichment effect with respect to soil P fractions and little effect on other elements. In terms of fire-related concentration changes, calcium was used as a conservative tracer to estimate soil reduction during muck burn ing. In this way, physical and chemical transformations could be resolved. To address potential ecological effects of such fire events, cattail (Typha domingensis) seedlings were planted in muck-, surface-, and non-burned soils collected from the area. Plant biomass was significantly higher in plants grown in muck-burned soils indicating that P availability, in addition to concentration, is an important factor regulating cattail invasion and ex pansion in the Everglades.

However, even though urbanization and suburbanization are major components of global change, the role of urban ecosystems as sourc es and sinks for carbon is unknown. The ecological, social, and economic drivers of carbon flow in urban areas are also unknown. Here, we present carbon budgets for four small watersheds within the Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER site. Three of the small watersheds lie along an urban-rural gradient from an inner-city residential neighborhood to a new suburban development on former agricultural land. A fourth, forested watershed act ed as a reference. Aerial photo interpretation was used to delineate patches of land-use and land-cover. Carbon pools and fluxes were then calculated for soil, vegetation, and human components in each patch and totaled for each watershed. Between watershed comparisons revealed a pattern of in creasing importance of the human component as urbanization proceeds. Human pools were lowest in the forested reference watershed and highest in the inner-city watershed. Human annual flux was lowest in the forested reference watershed but began to predominate budgets in the suburban watershed. The inner-city watershed's budget consisted almost entirely of flux from humans. SMITH, J. P. HawkWatch International, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah 84115. Raptor population trends discerned from 23 years of migration mon itoring in Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico. HawkWatch International has monitored migrations of diurnal raptors at a network of sites primarily in western North America (currently 15 sites) since 1977. The primary goal is to track long-term population trends and thereby provide early warnings about negative trends and a means of doc umenting conservation successes. Here I discuss trends at our 4 longest term sites. Trained observers conducted season-long counts of primarily 16 species in the Wellsville Mts., UT, 1977-79, 87-99 (autumn); Goshute Mts., NV, 1983-99 (autumn); and Manzano (autumn) and Sandia (spring) Mts., NM, 1985-99. Annual counts average: Goshute 14,931; Wellsville 3,729; Manzano 5,282; Sandia 4,145. I used linear regression to identify trends in annual passage rates (birds/100 hrs) derived from daily counts recorded using standardized methods and sampling periods, and adjusted for variation in observer numbers and effort (1987-99 only for Wellsvilles). At the high-volume Goshute site, 12 of 16 species increased (P ' 0.10) and 4 species showed no trends. Species that increased at ?3 sites included: Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura; 5-12%/yr), Osprey (Pandion haliaetus; 5-8%/yr), Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus; 3-9%/yr at 3 sites), Swainson's Hawk (B. swainsoni; 3-25%/yr), Merlin (Falco columbarius; 8-15%/yr at 3 sites), and Peregrine Falcon (F. peregrinus; 4-14%/yr). Based on regressions, declines emerged for Ferruginous Hawk (B. regalis) in the Manzanos (5%/yr) and Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter striatus; 4%/ yr) and American Kestrel (F. sparverius; 7%/yr) in the Wellsvilles. How ever, t-tests comparing mean annual passage rates for 1977-79 vs. 1987 99 in the Wellsvilles revealed declines for Northern Goshawk (A. gentilis; 56% overall decline) and Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos; 51%). These tests also revealed significant increases for 6 species that have shown no trend since 1987. I discuss factors that confound interpretations and offer plausible explanations for noteworthy trends. For example, Turkey Vultures are likely expanding their range northward in response to global warming and increasing in density in response to greater availability of open habitat and carrion associated with human activities.

The dynamics of most natural populations are determined by a variety of interacting factors. Distinguishing among the influences of these different factors is often difficult, partly because the relative importance of each may vary due to temporal variability in the environment. Here, I present the results of a 1999 experiment investigating the relative influences of prey availability and web-building structure on the abundance, reproduction and behavior, of Tetragnatha versicolor, an orb-weaving spider common along the banks of many temperate streams. The experiment was conducted along two streams in northern California, the South Fork Eel River and its less productive tributary, Elder Creek. Prey was augmented by moving floating mats of the alga Cladophora to the base of sedge tussocks used as web building structure by tetragnthids. Web-building structure was manipulated by clipping tussocks to 50% of their original stem density. Two weeks after prey augmentation, half of the tussocks receiving extra prey were clipped, producing a treatment combining both prey and structure manipulations. Prey augmentation led to significant increases in spider density and repro duction as compared with controls along both streams. Reducing structure in non-augmented tussocks led to a significant reduction in spider densities, but reproduction and behavior did not change significantly. In contrast, reducing structure in augmented tussocks led to significant increases in aggressive interactions as compared with any other tussocks in the study. These results indicate that in 1999, prey availability was more important than structure on both study streams in determining spider abundance, be havior, and reproduction. These results contrast with those obtained in a similar 1997 experiment, when spiders on the South Fork Eel responded much more strongly to a structure manipulation than to prey augmentation, while those on Elder Creek responded much the same as in 1999. Insect productivity was higher along the South Fork Eel in 1997 than in 1999, so other factors, such as web-building structure, might have been more critical during that year. These results show that while prey availability appears to be a critical determinant of the population dynamics of tetragnathids at this site, its importance may vary temporally.

Transpiration, root architecture, and biomass alloca tion in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and mesquite (Prosopis veluti na): Responses to experimental manipulations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with cottonwood (Populus fre montii) and mesquite (Prosopis velutina) to determine if allocation to fine and coarse roots, and rates of water absorption from hydraulically separated upper and lower soil compartments, would be altered by available soil moisture and defoliation. The lower soil compartments were irrigated to maintain high ("wet") or low ("dry") moisture availability. Half of the plants in each watering treatment were defoliated at regular intervals. Iso topically labeled water was supplied in pulses to upper soil compartments to determine the fraction of total transpiration water derived from each compartment. Transpirational water loss was measured with stem heat bal ance sensors. Transpiration per unit sapwood area was reduced in dry treat ments relative to wet treatments for cottonwood, yet the effect of defolia tion on transpiration was minimal. Water absorption from shallow soil lay ers appeared to increase in dry and defoliated treatments for cottonwood, whereas trees in the non-defoliated wet treatment used a lower proportion of shallow soil water. Dry treatments reduced total plant biomass and root mass ratio relative to wet treatments in cottonwood. Within the wet treat ment, root-mass ratio was lower for defoliated cottonwoods than non-de foliated controls. The ratio of fine to coarse roots in upper soil compart ments increased in dry and defoliated treatments. In contrast, watering treatments did not produce a consistent effect on the growth or biomass partitioning of mesquite. However, defoliation treatments were associated with greater allocation to shoots than roots, regardless of watering treat ment. There was no consistent treatment effect on fine to coarse root ratios for mesquite. It appears that above and belowground resource limitations will differentially alter the water absorption and root proliferation of these two species. Cottonwood preferentially allocated to fine roots in upper soil layers when water and/or carbon was limited, and this appeared to be as sociated with a greater proportion of shallow water use. In contrast, mes quite altered total abovegound to belowground allocation in response to defoliation treatment, yet there were no consistent effects of water or car bon limitations on root architecture.

Detoxification and elimination of plant toxins are thought to be responsible for limiting dietary specialization in mammalian herbivores. This hypoth esis, known as the detoxification limitation hypothesis, predicts that the few mammalian specialists that do exist should have adaptations for rapid detoxification and elimination of plant secondary compounds. We tested whether specialists clear toxins from their circulation faster than generalists. We compared the clearance rate of a plant toxin in closely related specialist (Neotoma stephensi) and generalist (N. albigula) woodrats. Both species were orally gavaged with alpha-pinene, the predominate monoterpene found in the host plant of the specialist. We collected venous blood 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 60, 90, and 140 minutes post-gavage. Blood was analyzed for alpha-pinene concentration using head-space gas chromatography. We found that specialists possess faster clearance rates than generalists when orally dosed with alpha-pinene. The concentration of alpha-pinene detected in the blood stream of the generalist was 5.5 - 6.4 times greater than in the specialist over all time intervals. The faster clearance rate of the spe cialist may allow them to have higher intakes of toxic diets. These data suggest one mechanism that may facilitate dietary specialization and sup port the detoxification limitations hypothesis. SORIA, M. C. and M. R. GARDENER. Charles Darwin Research Station, Galapagos 01-3891 Ecuador. Vegetation management in Galapagos and Hawaii Archipelagos. Two isolated island ecosystems, Galapagos and Hawaii, have both been severely affected by introduced plants. Hawaii has approximately 4600 introduced plants with 86 classified as serious pests in native ecosystems. The number of native and endemic plants recorded for Hawaii and Gala pagos are 1130 and 560 respectively. A larger proportion of these plants are threatened by habitat degradation in Hawaii than in Galapagos. The aim of this paper is to compare invasive weed problems in both archipel agos and discuss management practices. The most invasive weeds can be grouped into four different life forms: 1) Trees such as Psidium guajava, Syzygium jambos and Cinchona pubescens are invasive in Galapagos and Psidium cattleianum, Myrica faya, Acacia sp. in Hawaii; 2) Shrubs like Lantana camara and Rubus sp. are noxious weeds in both archipelagos; 3) Climbers such as Passiflora sp. in both archipelagos and; 4) grasses such as Melinis minutiflora, Panicum maximum and Pennisetum purpureum in Galapagos are aggresive. In Hawaii Pennisetum clandestinum, P.setaceum, M. minutiflora are troublesome. Manual and chemical control methods are used in both archipelagos whereas bio-control has been trialled only in Hawaii. Manual method have been successful in controlling small area whereas a combination of manual and chemical methods have been em ployed for large scale control. In Galapagos many new chemicals methods have been recently developed and possibilities for bio-control need to be investigated. SOTKA, E.1 and M. E.

Popu lation-level variation in herbivore performance on a toxic seaweed: A mechanistic and phylogenetic approach. Widely distributed herbivores are subject to locally distinct flora and con sequently, geographically separated populations often, though not always, prefer and perform best on local host plants. Theory which can explain such within-species variation has been developed largely from insects, and may profit from tests utilizing herbivores phylogenetically distinct from yet ecologically similar to insects. In this vein, the tube-dwelling amphipod Ampithoe longimana (Crustacea) is found in estuaries along most of the Atlantic coast of North America. Where the amphipod co-occurs with the tropical seaweed Dictyota, the seaweed provides protection from omnivo rous fishes as well as a quality food source. One such population has higher fitness on and shows greater affinity toward Dictyota than does a population which is not in sympatry with Dictyota. This difference in preference for Dictyota appears to be mediated by tolerance toward one or more diterpene alcohols found in the seaweed. A pertinent question is whether tolerance to these metabolites has been lost in herbivore populations which have spread beyond the zone of sympatry (via selection or drift) or alternatively, whether it has been gained by sympatric populations through natural se lection. To answer this, two independent loci were sequenced (the mito chondrial COI and nuclear ITS regions) in order to determine the historical patterns of differentiation among these populations. Preliminary data in dicates that rather than one group of populations being ancestral to the other, they are in fact reciprocally monophyletic at both loci, indicating a very long historical isolation from each other. Thus, we can't currently assess whether loss or gain of tolerance to Dictyota may have occurred, or whether both occurred simultaneously. SOUSA, W. P. University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, U.S.A. Prop agule predation dependent on canopy disturbance controls regenera tion of a Caribbean mangrove. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest that seed predation can strongly affect the demography and dynamics of low-density, seed-limited plant populations. However, when plant density is high, competition for micros ites suitable for establishment and growth may be more important in de termining the number of individuals that reach maturity than the number of surviving seeds. This dichotomous perspective does not account for more complex situations in which the risk of seed predation differs inside versus outside recruitment microsites. Such an interaction between micros ite quality and the risk of propagule predation occurs in low intertidal, mangrove forests on the Caribbean coast of Panama, where it appears to play a key role in shaping the demography and dynamics of the red man grove, Rhizophora mangle. This species' water-borne propagules can es tablish wherever they strand, but only those that do so in or near lightning created canopy gaps survive and grow to maturity. These microsites afford better growth conditions than the surrounding understory, but as impor tantly, provide a refuge from predation by the scolytid beetle, Coccotypes rhizophorae, a specialist feeder on Rhizophora propagules and seedlings. Sampling studies demonstrate that each year this herbivore kills nearly all 210 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="172">Rhi-ophora seedlings in the forest understory. When the beetle is experi mentally excluded with mesh cages, seedlings survive well in understory environments. This interaction may have a large impact on forest compo sition. Being shade-tolerant, Rhizophora seedlings that escape or survive beetle attack can persist in the understory for years. However, the high rate of beetle-induced mortality effectively eliminates the contribution of ad vance regeneration by Rhizophora saplings to gap succession, which may explain why the shade-intolerant, white mangrove, Laguncularia racemosa, is able to co-dominate the canopy in low intertidal forests at our study sites.

Climate change or changing climate variability: Which is worse for crop growth in the midwestern region of the United States? Starting with the assumption of global climate change by 2050 this research concentrates on assessing how agriculture in the Upper Midwest of the US will adapt to such climate change. Climatic variability in the form of tem poral fluctuations and spatial variations, is often more important, and may have more impact on crop growth than changes in average values. In this study, climate data for current conditions (VEMAP dataset) and for two future scenarios (HADCM2 model), in the form of monthly and daily val ues, were used to evaluate crop growth using DSSAT version 3.5, for 2050-59. These same climate data were then manipulated by changing their standard deviations to produce increased or decreased climate variability scenarios. Results were evaluated across 10 different locations, crop types, and climate scenarios (control or current conditions, mean changes, vari ance changes, mean and variance changes). The changes in climate do produce variable, crop specific results, with southern areas of our study region generally showing decreased yields for maize and soybean, and our northern areas having increasing yields. Differences are quite evident how ever, concerning the role of changes in the mean versus changes in vari ability, with increased variability climate scenarios producing dramatic and very damaging crop losses. Decreased variability scenarios however have the opposite effects, with large yield increases being the dominant trend. At atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 555 ppmv, CO2 fertilization effects indicate a potential for increased yields, especially for soybeans, with &gt; 20% yield increases under ideal growth conditions. Maize shows a more limited fertilization effect with approximately 5% yield increases when conditions are considered ideal. When plant growth is limited due to other environmental factors, e.g., temperatures, CO2 fertilization effects are neg ligible. SPARKS, J. P. and R. K. MONSON. University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, 80309, USA. Uptake of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in tropical tree leaves: Implications for tropospheric photochemistry? Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and other reactive nitrogen compounds (collec tively known as NOY) play important roles in controlling the oxidative chemistry of the lower atmosphere, including regulation of the photochem ical production of ozone, nitric acid and organic nitrates. Current atmo spheric chemistry models utilize soil NO emission rates as a primary input, and assume that oxidative conversions to other components of NOY within the plant canopy and subsequent uptake do not alter the concentrations or flux rates of these compounds. This assumption ignores past studies that have shown the potential for leaves of temperate tree species and crop species to assimilate NO2, and a past modeling study that demonstrated the potential for a wet tropical forest to assimilate up to 60% of the soil-emitted reactive nitrogen. In this study, we examined the ability of tropical forest leaves to take up NO2 using a leaf cuvette system in a wet tropical forest in Panama. Uptake rates varied across seventeen species from 41 to 1509 pmol in-2 s- at an ambient concentration of 5 ppbv. Plant emission of NO2 was observed at low ambient concentrations, indicating the existence of an NO2 compensation point. Emission rates varied across seventeen species from 1 to 91 pmol in-2 s-' at ambient concentrations &lt; 0.5 ppbv. NO2 compensation points varied across five species from 0.5 to 1.7 ppbv NO2. Uptake and emission rates of NO2 were positively correlated with photo synthetic rate and stomatal conductance. NO2 uptake rate increased with height within the canopy, again in concert with increased photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance. Uptake rates were positively, and linearly correlated to NO, concentration (up to 20 ppbv) in all species examined. Depending on ambient NO2 concentrations the tropical forest at this Pan ama site has the potential to be an NO, source or sink, significantly af fecting local photochemistry. SPEIRS, D. C. and W. S. C. GURNEY. University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland. Population persistence in rivers. Many organisms inhabiting streams and rivers are continually subjected to downstream drift, and when this is the only transport process population extinction is inevitable. Using analytical and numerical models representing a range of hydrodynamic scenarios, we demonstrate how the action of random dispersal can permit persistence in such advective environments by allowing a proportion of the population to reproduce close to their natal location. We establish convenient approximate analytic conditions for dif fusion-mediated persistence in benthic and planktonic populations. The ap proximations are supported by numerical simulations which also indicate the robustness of the results to variations in hydrodynamics. Estimating parameters from published field studies, we show that the persistence of various aquatic invertebrates may be diffusively mediated in situations where horizontal dispersal is high and advection is relatively low. SPRUGEL, D. G. University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-2100 USA. When branch autonomy fails: Size does matter. Sprugel and Hinckley proposed that "One can predict many important growth and physiological characteristics of a branch from its morphology and position in the canopy alone, without reference to the characteristics of the tree as a whole". A variety of newer studies show that this is only partly true. For example, shoots attached to a shaded tree grow more rapidly than shoots in the same light environment but attached to a sunlit tree. Although counterintuitive, this is a logical allocation of resources within a tree: A branch in a more favorable environment than the rest of the branch es on a tree will receive a larger proportion of the resources available to support growth, while one that is more shaded than others on its tree will receive a lower proportion of resources. This is consistent with the finding that shaded trees often invest more carbon and nitrogen per unit of light captured than trees that have access to better-lit environments. A related pattern occurs when one branch of a tree is exposed to a different pollution treatment than the rest of the tree: A "polluted" branch on a "polluted" tree photosynthesizes more rapidly than a "polluted" branch on a "clean" tree, and a "clean"branch on a "polluted" tree photosynthesizes more rapidly than a "clean" branch on a "clean" tree. These examples suggest important limitations to the branch autonomy hypothesis. STABLER, L. B. and C. A. MARTIN. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-1601 USA. Seasonal patterns of plant water status and gas exchange in two Sonoran Desert landscapes. Plant water status and gas exchange were studied at three remnant Sonoran Desert sites inside South Mountain Preserve, Phoenix, Arizona, USA and three drip-irrigated residential lots adjacent to the Preserve to elucidate how land conversion from desert to urban residential affected plant function. Pre-dawn shoot water potential (&lt;FONT FACE= "Symbol" &gt;Y&lt;/FONT&gt;) and diel shoot relative water content (RWC) and gas exchange were mea sured during four consecutive seasons (hot summer, wet monsoon, winter and spring) in 1998-99 on dominant trees and shrubs. Soil water content (WSoIL) was sampled gravimetrically at a depth of 20 cm. Pre-dawn shoot (&lt;FONT FACE="Symbol"&gt;Y&lt;/FONT&gt;) and WSOIL were always higher at residential than desert sites except during the summer monsoon, when plant shoot &lt;FONT FACE= "Symbol"&gt;Y&lt;/FONT&gt;) and WSOIL were similar. RWC of residential plants was always higher than desert plants. RWC of all plants was highest during spring. Time-of-day did not affect RWC. Fluxes of net carbon assimilation (A), transpiration (E), and shoot conductance (gs) were always higher for plants in residential than desert sites. Maximum A of residential plants occurred later in the day than desert plants during the summer and winter seasons. Desert plant A and E were highest during the monsoon season. Instantaneous transpiration efficiency (ITE) was always highest for plants in residential sites, except during the Oral Presentation Abstracts 211</page><page sequence="173">monsoon, when the ITE of residential and desert plants was similar. Over all, A was most positively correlated to gs (r= 0.82), while ITE was most negatively correlated to shoot temperature (r= -0.67). Fluxes of A were more negatively correlated to shoot &lt;FONT FACE= "Symbol"&gt;Y&lt;/ FONT&gt;) for desert plants (r= - 0.61) than residential plants (r= -0.08). ITE was more positively correlated to WSOIL for residential plants (r= 0.69) than desert plants (r= 0.04). A negative correlation between A and shoot temperature existed for all plants during the monsoon season (r= -0.67). These data suggest that maximum CO2 uptake and ITE were a function of plant water status and temperature, and that conversion of land from desert to urban residential might increase plant water and carbon cycling.

Biodiversity and species invasions in marine invertebrate communities. Along with habitat modification, the intentional or accidental introduction of new species by humans is a leading cause of the global biodiversity crisis. Because biological invasions can dramatically alter community com position and ecosystem function and cause considerable economic damage, there is significant interest in understanding why and how successful in vasions occur. Theory first proposed by Elton predicts that species-rich communities should be less susceptible to invasion, but the evidence has been equivocal and often contradictory. Small-scale experimental studies tend to support the Eltonian hypothesis, whereas larger scale, observational studies often show the opposite relationship. We studied the invasion of subtidal marine invertebrate communities in coastal New England by exotic tunicates and bryozoans from Asia and Europe. In local 0.25 by 0.25 m neighborhoods within these communities, native species richness was neg atively correlated with the species richness of introduced species. When we manipulated species richness in experimentally assembled 10 by 10 cm communities, we found that more diverse communities were more resistant to invasion by both colonial (Botrylloides diegensis) and solitary (Asci diella adspersa) species. This appeared to be the result of a more complete utilization of resources (primary space) in communities with a greater num ber of native species. Despite a high degree of functional redundancy among the native species, increased numbers of species provided "insur ance" against fluctuations in the abundance of any one species. Our ex perimental manipulation demonstrates that diversity, per se, does increase community resistance to invasion by exotic species, but factors correlated with diversity (e.g., larval supply, current regime, microhabitat diversity, etc.) may facilitate invasion, producing positive correlations between native and introduced species diversity on larger scales in the field. This apparent contradiction has important implications for management of marine com munities and the selection of sites for marine reserves. STANLEY, T R. U.S. Geological Survey, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525 USA. The role of small mammal predation on nesting success of grass land nesting birds. Birds endemic to the central shortgrass prairie ecoregion have experienced steep and widespread declines in the past three decades. While the causes for these declines have not been identified, factors influencing reproductive success have been implicated. Nest predation is the major cause of nest failure in passerines and nesting success of prairie birds in the shortgrass prairie is exceptionally low. Data collected in 1997 on the Pawnee National Grasslands, Colorado, suggested nest predation on grassland birds was higher in fragmented tracts of shortgrass prairie, where the vegetation is taller in stature, than in the shorter vegetation associated with unfragmented landscapes. One possible explanation for this pattern is that the increased vegetative structure on fragmented and other altered landscapes; for ex ample prairie sites put into the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), sup ports denser populations of small mammals, the primary nest predators of ground-nesting grassland birds. In this study, I compared vegetation struc ture, small mammal densities, and artificial nest predation rates on frag mented shortgrass prairie sites and CRP sites, with unfragmented (intact) shortgrass prairie sites. In 1998 eight intact and eight fragmented shortgrass prairie sites were paired and sampled, and in 1999 seven intact and seven CRP sites were paired and sampled. Small mammal densities were esti mated using trapping webs, and nest predation rates were estimated using artificial nests containing one Japanese quail egg and, optionally, one clay egg. Vegetation structure on fragmented shortgrass prairie and CRP sites differed from intact shortgrass prairie sites, but vegetation structure was not found to be a good predictor of small mammal densities. On paired intact and fragmented shortgrass prairie sites small mammal density was found to be the best predictor of nest predation rates, whereas on paired intact and CRP sites vegetation structure was found to be the best predictor of nest predation rates. Small mammal species composition was similar on paired intact and fragmented shortgrass prairie sites, whereas it differed markedly on paired intact and CRP sites. STANLEY, A. G.

Available time series data for Snake River spring chinook, recently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, indicate not only large declines in population size, but strong coherence between subpopulations as well. Redd counts for 36 subpopulations show strong positive correlation (0.2-0.8) over the past 20-40 years; however the cause of this spatial correlation (dispersal, environmental variation, or some combination there of) is currently unknown. I developed a spatial model for Snake River spring chinook to determine how assumptions about the cause of the spatial correlation between subpopulations changes estimates of extinction risk. In the model, each subpopulation has the same growth and variance param eters, calculated from values in the literature and fitted to the available trend data. The probability of dispersing from one subpopulation to another is a function of dispersal rate, source population size, and distance between subpopulations. Environmental variance is modeled as a variance-covari ance in growth rate. Dispersal rate, amount of covariance, and the number of initial subpopulations was varied and risk of extinction calculated from Monte Carlo simulations. Parameter sets that did not generate observed levels of spatial correlation between subpopulations were discarded. Ex tinction risk increased with increasing contribution of environmental vari ation; higher dispersal rates reduced extinction risk through a rescue effect. The model results indicate that the assumptions regarding the cause of spatial correlation can profoundly influence estimates of extinction risk. STARK, M. V. and S. R. JOHNSON.

We found favorable conditions for significant physiological activity in the subnivean environment of the Alaskan arctic tundra during spring. The physical properties of the snow load during spring melt produces a natural greenhouse with elevated concentrations of CO2 Temperatures in the sub nivean environment were as much as 4 0 C warmer and CO2 concentrations were 30 ppm above ambient conditions. These increases in temperature and carbon dioxide coupled with increasing levels of light under the snow allow for significant photosynthetic activity in four species: Ledum palus tre, Vaccinium vitis-idea, Eriophorum vaginatum, and Cassiope tetragona. Photosynthetic rates under ambient conditions were as high as 20% of growing season maxima, while measures of Amax reached approximately 212 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="174">40% of the growing season maxima. In addition, the average variable fluo rescence, Fv/Fm, of the four species was approximately 50% of their sum mer maxima. At the species level, this activity although quite variable, helps compensate for large winter losses of carbon due to foliar respiration when light inputs are nonexistent. This physiological activity also enabled the plants to reach their maximum physiological capacity quickly once melt occurred. These four species comprise 30% of the vascular ground cover in the tussock tundra community, and they are significant contributors to the ecosystem carbon budget. Evidence is growing that the proportion of these species in the community is declining with recent warming trends, and that the tundra community shows increased dominance by the decid uous shrub Betula nana. In the last decade it has been shown that the Alaskan tundra has become a carbon source with the increases in annual temperature. Losses of evergreens should alter the community's carbon sink-source capacity in the spring, making the system a larger carbon source. STAV, G., B. P. KOTLER and L.

Direct and indirect effects of the predatory drag onfly nymph Anax imperator on green toad Bufo viridis tadpoles. We conducted an artificial pool experiment to assess effects of the preda tory dragonfly nymph Anax imperator on green toad Bufo viridis tadpoles. We ran three treatments (with six replicate pools each): (1) free Anax (direct effects on mortality); (2) caged Anax (indirect effects on behavior, devel opment and individual growth rates); and (3) control (no Anax). We added 15 liters (10 cm depth) of water to each pool. After five days, we added 30 three-day old tadpoles, all hatched from the same egg string. Caged Anax were fed with tadpoles three times a week. The experiment ran from 11 April through 4 August. Free Anax eliminated 90% of the tadpoles within three days and all of them within six days. Caged Anax had no effect on the spatial distribution of tadpoles. However, caged Anax caused tadpoles to metamorphose earlier to a larger size (both statistically signif icant), and to obtain lighter color. This study shows that Anax has a very strong direct effect on the population of Bufo tadpoles. Future experiments will be designed to determine whether the prey responses to the predator are reactions to predation or the result of extra organic matter in this treat ment (consequence of Anax feeding and secretion). STEINER, C. F W. K. Kellogg Biological Station, Hickory Corners, MI 49060. The effects of prey heterogeneity and consumer identity on the limitation of trophic-level biomass. Models of keystone predation suggest a central role of prey heterogeneity in determining the strength of predator interactions and patterns of trophic structure along productivity gradients. If trade-offs exist among prey in predator resistance and competitive ability, increasing productivity can per mit prey turnover (favoring resistants), consequently dampening predator limitation and allowing increases in total prey biomass. Furthermore, in aquatic systems, limitation of algal communities is thought to hinge on zooplankton-predator identity. Compared to small species, large-bodied Daphnia are thought to be stronger interactors with algal-prey. I investi gated the roles of consumer size and prey heterogeneity on trophic structure by performing a controlled laboratory experiment using 18-liter enclosures and a model aquatic community. In this study, I created a simple food chain comprised of a single edible prey, and a food web comprised of a diverse assemblage of algal-prey. I then fully crossed these two treatments with two predator treatments (large Daphnia versus small Ceriodaphnia), and two levels of productivity. Results provided clear support for the key stone predator model. Predators had strong negative effects in food chains and algal-prey biomass exhibited no response to enrichment. In contrast, predator limitation was weak in food webs with the consequence that pred ator and prey biomass both showed positive increases with productivity. The prey community in food webs also exhibited a striking increase in the relative abundance of large inedible algae with enrichment, in keeping with model predictions. Predator identity had little effect on prey composition or overall prey biomass in both food chains and food webs. These results indicate that prey heterogeneity can have substantial effects on trophic structure and can serve to shift systems from strong top-down limitation to ones in which prey are co-limited by predator and resource effects.

The impacts of soil moisture and temperature on longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) fine root dynamics. Soil moisture and temperature are thought to play a major role in fine root dynamics in forest systems. However, few field experiments have been conducted to determine the specific impacts of these environmental vari ables. In an attempt to provide such direct evidence, we conducted an experiment to measure pine fine root dynamics across a range of canopy conditions (open to dense) in a Pinus palustris savanna in southern Geor gia. We installed minirhizotrons in January 1998 to measure pine fine root dynamics on a weekly basis for a full year (July 1998 to July 1999) and made concomitant measurements of soil temperature and moisture at 10 cm depth increments to 40 cm. Fine root standing crop was low at the beginning of sampling possibly due to the early summer drought in 1998. Total fine root length increased greatly (&gt; 350%) from July to November, a period of 'typical' rainfall levels. Fine root length standing crop per minirhizotron tube in November 1998 was significantly (p&lt;0.05) but neg atively correlated with soil moisture levels; i.e. higher production occurred on drier sites. Fine root mortality patterns seem also to be correlated with moisture: an episode of rapid decline in fine root length (20% reduction in standing crop) occurred in April 1999, this decline appears closely corre lated with low rainfall levels (&lt; 8 mm total) for the same month. Tem perature was not significantly correlated with moisture or with fine root production, suggesting that temperature plays a fairly minor role in this warm temperate system. Overall, it appears that soil moisture levels control patterns of Pinus palustris fine root production and mortality. Extreme moisture values, both high and low, are associated with low fine root stand ing crop. However, the mechanisms by which moisture controls root mass, i.e. reduced production or increased mortality, remain unclear. STILL, C.,1,2 J. BERRY,' M. RIBAS-CARBO,l B. HELLIKER3 and S.

Seasonal and interannual variations in the isotopic composition of carbon fluxes in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The photosynthetic composition of an ecosystem is an important controller of carbon fluxes and surface energy balance partitioning. Many Great Plains grasslands contain seasonally changing mixtures of C3 and C4 plants. We present data on the isotopic composition of carbon fluxes collected at a mixed C3-C4 tallgrass prairie site in Oklahoma. This ecosystem is typically characterized by C3 grass and forb cover in the cooler and wetter spring, while the hotter and drier summer favors C4 grasses. In order to assess seasonal variations in these photosynthetic mixtures, we collected nighttime respiration samples from a small tower above the canopy and analyzed them for their CO2 concentration and carbon isotope composition. The C3: C4 mixture was calculated with a simple mixing analysis. Collections throughout the 1999 growing season indicate the C4 contribution to eco system respiration varied from 40% in April to 54% in June to 88% in September. We also collected daytime gradient samples from the highest and lowest levels and calculated the canopy discrimination. Again, the C3: C4 mixture was determined with a simple mixing analysis. The C4 per centage calculated from this approach doesn't agree with the percentage determined from the nighttime respiration for sampling periods in June and July. This implies a sampling problem (i.e. different sampling 'footprints' between the day and night) and/or a seasonal imbalance between the iso topic composition of photosynthesis and respiration. Finally, we demon strate the potential use of the oxygen isotope composition of CO2 as a new constraint on C3 and C4 photosynthetic fluxes. STILLER, V. and J. S. SPERRY.

Tolerance of low xylem pressure that often accompanies drought is facili tated by cavitation-resistant xylem. Recently, laboratory studies have shown that water stress episodes can weaken xylem, making it more sus Oral Presentation Abstracts 213</page><page sequence="175">ceptible to cavitation by air seeding during future stress. If weakening occurs in the field and is not reversible, it would seriously influence the response of plants to multiple droughts. In this study we investigated whether (a) the weakening effect can be detected in vivo, and (b) whether it can be repaired by the plant. We subjected sunflowers (Helianthus an nuus) to soil drought in the greenhouse. Vulnerability to cavitation was measured after droughts causing 0%, 52% and 88% loss of xylem conduc tivity (% embolism). A dramatic weakening effect was observed wherein droughted xylem developed up to 80% embolism at -1 MPa vs. only 15% in non-droughted controls. A second set of sunflowers was droughted to approximately 90% embolism and then rewatered for periods up to 4 days. Rewatered plants showed progressive recovery from the weakening effect with complete recovery after 4 days. Recovery required the intact plant, because we could not duplicate it in excised stems. Recovery was also correlated with the refilling of embolized vessels (R=0.966, P&lt;0.01), sug gesting that xylem transport to weakened vessels was required. We were able to stimulate recovery from weakening in excised petioles of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). The rate of recovery was correlated with temperature, and was greatly accelerated by perfusion with 2mM CaCl2. Neither effect was observed for sunflower stems suggesting differ ences in recovery mechanism between species. We suspect that weakening is caused by stretching and partial disruption of linkages between cellulose microfibrils in inter-conduit pit membranes, and that recovery involves re storing these linkages.

Genetic constraints and diffuse selection on resistance to deer herbivory in the Ivyleaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea. Recent theory has suggested that coevolution between plants and their nat ural enemies will be diffuse when either of two conditions are met. First, coevolution is likely to be diffuse if there is a genetic correlation between defenses to different species of natural enemies. Second, coevolution is likely to be diffuse if the pattern of natural selection imposed by one natural enemy is altered by the presence or absence of other natural enemies. Under this view of diffuse coevolution, the evolution of plant defense traits in response to multiple natural enemies is characterized by either genetic or ecological constraints, or both. We have evaluated whether or not the con ditions for diffuse coevolution are met for the Ivyleaf morning glory, Ip omoea hederacea, and its insect, fungal, and mammalian natural enemies. Specifically, we used a quantitative genetics field experiment to estimate genetic correlations between resistance traits and measure the pattern of selection on resistance to deer herbivory in the presence and absence of both insect herbivores and pathogenic fungi. We have found that coevo lution is likely to be diffuse in this system because both conditions for diffuse coevolution are satisfied. For example, there is a significant negative genetic correlation between resistance to deer herbivory and resistance to generalist insect herbivory. Furthermore, while selection favors greater re sistance to deer herbivory in the presence of both insects and fungi, we were unable to detect selection on resistance to deer herbivory in the ab sence of either insects or fungi, or both. Thus, the pattern of natural selec tion on resistance traits is dependent on the composition of the natural enemy community. These results indicate that the evolution of resistance traits in this species is likely to be constrained by both genetic and eco logical factors. STINSON, K. A.,12 D. A. STRATTON 2 and F A.

Local adaptation vs. source sink dynamics in marginal populations of Potentilla species. Marginal populations may persist by local adaptation in marginal sites, or by net immigration from favorable central sites into less favorable marginal sites (source-sink dynamics). I examined the evidence for these two alter native mechanisms, and the implications for range expansion, in two high altitude Potentilla species which have co-existing marginal populations at the alpine/sub-alpine ecotone. Marginal and central populations of both species were transplanted within and beyond the species' border and were exposed to either natural environmental conditions, or to those mimicking the home environment. Marginal populations of the broad-ranging meadow species were larger and had higher growth rates, survival, and reproductive success than central populations beyond the species' range regardless of environmental treatments. This suggests that local adaptation near the sub alpine/alpine ecotone may enhance the likelihood of up-slope migration in the sub-alpine species. In contrast, both marginal and central populations of the alpine species did poorly below the tundra border and responded somewhat better to conditions typical of the alpine, source habitat. In this species, dispersal from source sites into patchy sites of suitable habitat may constrain selection and reduce the likelihood of distributional shifts at the species border. This study indicates that sustained phenotypic responses and distributional shifts are likely in the broader-ranging sub-alpine species because selection is able to occur in marginal sites. On the other hand, marginal populations of the tundra specialist are more likely to experience local extinctions at the species border, because selection appears to be bi ased toward source populations. STIREMAN III, J. 0. University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA. The community ecology of tachinid-host interactions. Tachinid flies are a diverse and widespread group of insect parasitoids. Despite their importance as enemies of herbivorous insects in many natural and agricultural ecosystems, their ecological relationships with hosts are largely unknown. Analyses of hymenopteran parasitoid communities and literature databases of parasitoid-host records have revealed a number of factors that influence the richness and character of parasitoid complexes. These include host morphology, host-plant architecture, and host taxonomic affiliation. However, tachinids differ from the better studied hymenopteran parasitoids in a variety of ways that are likely to influence patterns of host use including their avoidance of host immune defenses, their frequent habit of indirect oviposition, and perhaps most importantly, their relatively wide host ranges. These and other traits suggest that ecological characteristics of a host are more important in determining whether it is used by a par ticular tachinid than its physiology or phylogenetic affinity. In order to examine how ecological characteristics of hosts influence the diversity and identity of tachinids that attack them, I conducted a four year sampling program of diurnal exophytic macrolepidoptera and their parasitoids in the mesquite-oak grasslands of Southeastern Arizona. From this program I have constructed a semi-quantitative parasitoid-host web. Preliminary anal yses of these data demonstrated a high variability in local host range among tachinids, with many species being restricted to a single host while others attacked hosts in close accordance with their abundance in the field. In contrast to previous studies, parasitoid species richness was found to be higher on herb-feeding hosts relative to those on trees and higher for hairy caterpillars as opposed to smooth ones. I also found tachinid species rich ness inversely correlated with the level of host-plant specialization of the host. Host microhabitat, along with certain taxonomically widespread mor phological traits, was demonstrated to be of primary importance in deter mining patterns of host use in tachinids. STORK, A. W.

Phenotypic plasticity is an important adaptation for plants that live in var iable environments. For plants that preform their organs, past developmen tal events may particularly constrain plasticity. In Smilacina stellata, tissues form under late season light levels but plants emerge the following growing season under different, early season light levels. To address if S. stellata can respond to the light environment of emerging plants, I manipulated light levels for open fen (OF), forested fen (FF), and floodplain (FP) pop ulations. Plants from all habitats showed reduced specific leaf weight (SLW) in response to shade treatments but FP plants response was twice, and OF plants was four times greater than the response of FF plants. Plants also varied in dark respiration responses: FF plants showed no response, FP plants showed minimal response, and OF treatment plants showed a significant decrease in dark respiration. To determine if these habitat-level differences would persist under common conditions, experiments were con ducted on plants grown under greenhouse conditions. Shade treatment plants showed a significant reduction in SLW (25 g m -2 compared to 40 g m -2) but did not show a significant habitat effect. Plants did not show significant treatment or habitat effects for dark respiration. The field and greenhouse experiments show that S. stellata, even though it preforms its 214 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="176">tissues under previous environments, can respond to the light levels of emerging plants. Plants do not vary by habitat in their ability to respond to early season light: Variation in plastic responses to light appears to be light-level dependent in S. stellata. STRAUSS, S. UC Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA. The roles of herbivory and other environmental factors on a flower color polymorphism. Flower color polymorphisms are traditionally thought to be maintained by selection from pollinators. In wild radish (Raphanus sativus) previous in vestigators showed that bee and fly pollinators exhibit different preferences for white-, yellow- and pink- flowered plants. Herbivory and other envi ronmental factors may also act as selective agents in this system. Manip ulations of plots of wild radish in the field included watering treatments, molluscicides, pesticides and controls. All treatments had effects on plant fitness, and there was a significant treatment by flower color interaction. That is, the relative fitness of the white- and yellow- flowered plants re versed in watering versus other treatments. In addition, surveys of flowers showed that flower-feeding thrips were significantly more dense in pig mented flowers than in white flowers. These results indicate that important selective agents on traits are not easily identified and that fluctuating se lection due to changing environmental conditions may act to preserve the polymorphism in this system.

The 3 families of bivalves that live together in the freshwater tidal Hudson River have different life cycles and showed different dynamics during the first decade of the zebra mussel invasion of the river. Zebra mussels, which have planktotrophic larvae and a life span of 3-5 years, appeared in the Hudson in 1991 and have dominated the ecosystem since fall 1992. They reduced phytoplankton biomass in the river by 80%. Because of strong adult-larval interactions, the zebra mussel population underwent large cy cles with a 3-4 year period, the size and coherence of which appear to be diminishing. The native unionid mussels have parasitic larvae and live for more than 10 years. Formerly constituting more than half of zoobenthic biomass in the river, their populations have fallen by 80% and have not yet stabilized 7 years after the invasion. The 2 unionid species that breed in late summer have disappeared, while the single species that breeds in spring still persists. The sphaeriids have direct development and an annual life cycle. Although we have the least information about this family, it appears that sphaeriid populations in the Hudson fell by 72% in the first 2 years after the zebra mussel invasion and have remained low. Because bivalve populations have slow demographic response times, it may take years to decades for the effect of a perturbation to be fully expressed. STRENGBOM, J.,' A. NORDIN,2 T. NASHOLM2 and L.

Parasitic fungus mediates vegetation change in nitrogen exposed boreal forest. Experimental additions of nitrogen (12.5 and 50kg N ha-' year ha-', in the form of NH4NO3) were made to an old-growth boreal forest in northern Sweden once a year during the period 1996-1998. Vegetation analysis with the point intercept method showed a significant increase in abundance of the grass Deschampsia flexuosa after three years of nitrogen addition. Ni trogen treatment also resulted in a significant increase in disease incidence of a parasitic fungus (Valdensia heterodoxa) which attacks leaves of the dominant dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus. Analysis of amino acids, as their 9-fluorenylmethylformate (FMOC) derivatives in leaves of V. myrtil lus revealed significant elevated level of glutamine already during the first year of nitrogen treatment. In a separate study, spraying non-fertilised V. myrtillus leaves with a glutamine solutions significantly increased the dis ease incidence of the parasite, supporting the hypothesis that the parasite responds strongly on nitrogen-induced biochemical changes of its host. A comparison between the abundance of D.flexuosa in healthy and diseased patches of the dominant species V. myrtillus, revealed significant effects of both disease and nitrogen treatment. The increase of the grass was in fact confined to patches of V. myrtillus that were diseased. The shift in vege tation resulted from interactions with a second trophic level, and interspe cific competition for the limiting resource, nitrogen, was less important. This shows that low levels of nitrogen deposition can have marked effects on vegetation by affecting the interaction between dominant, slow-growing species and their natural enemies. SUEDKAMP, K., F GUTHERY and S. FUHLENDORE Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA . Effects of thermal loading on the nest microclimate of ground-nesting birds. In semi-arid regions, thermoregulatory constraints may limit avian repro duction more than predator avoidance or food gathering strategies. Land management practices, such as livestock grazing, may further exacerbate thermal loading by reducing plant cover critical for moderating temperature fluctuations. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of grazing intensity (none, moderate, and heavy) on the thermal and structural properties of nests for seven ground-nesting bird species. We measured ground temper ature, litter depth, and distance to visual obstruction at nest and random points monthly in each treatment during the 1999 breeding season. For species building cup nests, average maximum temperature was lower at nests compared to random points in the ungrazed and heavily grazed treat ments, but higher at nests in the moderately grazed treatment. Average maximum temperature was higher at nests compared to random points in all treatments for birds that build scrape nests. Litter depth was higher at nests compared to random points for all species. Distance to visual obstruc tion was longer at nests compared to random points in the ungrazed and heavily grazed treatments for species that build cup nests, but was longer at nests in the ungrazed treatment for birds that build scrape nests. Our results show that birds with different nest building strategies select grazing intensities with different thermal and structural properties. Differences among nest-type guilds should be incorporated in future studies assessing grazing impacts on ground-nesting birds. SULLIVAN, T J. and S. H. FAETH. Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA. Genetic variation of Neotyphodium in Arizona fescue. Fungal endophytes occur in the vast majority of plant species with inter actions ranging from parasitism to mutualism, making them useful systems for studying the ecology and evolution of symbiosis. One of the best stud ied genera of fungal endophytes, Neotyphodium, lives symbiotically with its pooid grass hosts. Neotyphodium endophytes are asexual, vertically transmitted, and may have strong mutualistic relationships with their hosts, at least in the agricultural grasses tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea, and perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne. Despite these traits, they do not appear to show a strict pattern of coevolution with their plant hosts. For example, one strain of Neotyphodium in perennial ryegrass is the result of hybrid ization with the grass choke pathogen, Epichlok typhina. Arizona fescue, Festuca arizonica, is a grass native to the southwestern United States with most individuals harboring Neotyphodium. Unlike agricultural grasses, Ar izona fescue is native to the United States and has not undergone any significant artificial selection or cultivation, making it ideal for examining natural patterns of genetic variation within Neotyphodium. Previous re search, using DNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA, described three distinct genetic types of Neoty phodium in Arizona fescue from a survey of 13 individuals in 9 populations in New Mexico. For this study, we isolated Neotyphodium from at least 20 individuals from 3 populations in Arizona to examine both broad geograph ic and within population variation. Based upon these ITS sequences, we found more distinct genetic types than the previous study, with substantial genetic distances between these types, and no clear pattern of coevolution. SULLIVAN, J.

A rather broad range of responses or "sensitivity' to UV-B radiation has been observed among plant species. This inter-specific variability has been linked with growth form, photosynthetic pathway and latitudinal or ele vational distribution. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for this are still poorly understood. Differences in the type and localization patterns of UV-absorbing phenolics have been postulated to play a role in these re Oral Presentation Abstracts 215</page><page sequence="177">sponses. We evaluated the quantitative and qualitative responses of red maple (Acer rubrum), tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) to supplemental UV-B levels in seedlings and mature trees. Histochemical and phytochemical analyses have demonstrated contrasting patterns of phenolic composition and deposition between the species but very few differences between seedlings and foliage from mature trees. Red maple and sweetgum contain both soluble and bound phenolics with the bound fraction confined almost entirely to the vasculature. The flavonoids present are almost entirely epidermal while hydroxycinnamates (HCAs) are found in the mesophyll. In contrast, tulip poplar has both fla vonoids and HCAs in the epidermis and also contains wall bound HCAs in the epidermis. Patterns of distribution and phytochemical make-up are probably under genetic control but quantitative responses were modulated by exposure to UV-B radiation. Levels of both flavonoids and HCAs in creased in response to UV-B radiation but the increase was greater in fla vonoids compared to that of HCAs. However, the extent to which HCAs contribute to UV-screening may exceed that of flavonoids due to the high absorptivity of HCAs compared to flavonoids in the UV-B region. SULZMAN, E. W.,1,2 E.

Isotopic equilibrium between soil CO2 and soil water. A field study was undertaken to examine the factors influencing the isotopic exchange of CO2 between soil and atmosphere. Sites along two elevational transects including alpine tundra, lodgepole pine, and shortgrass steppe eco systems were sampled over two growing seasons. We developed new ana lytical methodology that incorporates direct equilibration of the original soil samples with CO2 in helium, followed by irm-GCMS analysis of the 180. The oxygen isotopic signature of soil CO2 is set by the soil water with which it is in contact according to: H2180(l) + C02(g) &lt;-&gt; H20(1) + C0180. Previous studies assumed equilibrium to be at the soil surface but a recent laboratory study showed that the actual depth of equilibrium was between 5 and 15 cm. This field study shows that ecosystem type, and in some cases soil texture, influence the depth of equilibrium. In the shortgrass steppe ecosystem there was often disequilibrium between soil CO2 and soil water, presumably be cause of high atmospheric invasion and rapid diffusion under arid conditions. In the alpine system equilibrium between water and CO2 was close to the soil surface (&lt; 5-10 cm), whereas it was deeper in the soil profile (&gt; 8 cm) at the lodgepole sites. Model results suggest that the isotopic composition of soil-respired CO2 is close to that of near-surface soil C02, even when there was no equilibrium between CO2 and soil water at this depth.

The influence of hab itat heterogeneity on the rates of ecological processes: An experimental assessment in a stream ecosystem. While habitat heterogeneity is known to govern population dynamics, inter specific interactions, and community structure, very little is known about how habitat heterogeneity influences the ecological processes that are vital to the functioning of ecosystems. We performed an experiment manipulating the variance of rock sizes in riffle habitats of a small Piedmont stream, while holding the median particle size constant, with the goal of altering hetero geneity in near bed flow. We tracked the following ecological processes: Benthic respiration, net primary production, gross primary production, leaf and wood decomposition, and organic matter retention (FPOM and CPOM). We found that increases in substrate and flow heterogeneity led to increased benthic respiration and gross primary productivity, but a negative trend in leaf decomposition rate. The results for wood decomposition and organic matter retention were highly variable, and we concluded that heterogeneity played a negligible role in these processes. While we manipulated substrate heterogeneity, differences were likely mediated by flow effects: high hetero geneity invoked higher mean and spatial variance in flow velocity and tur bulence. Our results suggest that physical habitat heterogeneity may directly govern the rates of ecological processes that are crucial to the functioning of an ecosystem. TALLMON, D. A., N. RADKE,I L.

Positive effects of clearcutting on deer mouse de mography leads to increased trillium seed predation. We have found that forest fragmentation leads to increased abundance of deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus on a landscape scale in our southwest Oregon study sites. Deer mice are much more common in clearcuts than in forests and show decreased abundance from the forest/clearcut edge toward the interior of forest fragments. Within clearcuts, Trillium ovatum seed pre dation was much greater in areas of higher mouse use than areas of low mouse use and trillium seed predation was correlated with capture rate of mice across 11 clearcut transects. The changes in mouse abundance that accompany the conversion of forest to clearcuts may lead to the near absence of trillium recruitment in clearcuts found previously. Further, the positive effects timber harvest practices have on deer mouse abundance may alter succession patterns by affecting recruitment in other plant species. TANK, J. L.' and D. M.

We used a 15N tracer addition to quantify nitrogen cycling through the food web of a small subarctic stream in Northern Iceland. Beginning after snow melt, we added '5N-NH4Cl continuously for 4 weeks and followed the flow of "5N into the stream food web. Despite low stream temperatures (mean = 6.9 C), N uptake was rapid; ammonium uptake lengths ranged from 122 130m. By day 4 of the release, all food web compartments were labeled with tracer "5N. After 21 days, filamentous green algae had the highest tracer 8 '5N values in the food web. Fine benthic organic material (FBOM) was less labeled than the bulk epilithon indicating that FBOM may have been a mix ture of sloughed algae and other detritus. 15N uptake in the two groups of chironomids (Diamesinae and Orthocladiinae) was similar and chironomids were more highly labeled than the larger bodied blackfly (Neosimulium vit tatum). Blackflies appeared to feed on the epilithic biofilm and associated fine particles as tracer "5N in blackflies was similar to that in bulk epilithon and FBOM. In contrast, the tracer 15N in chironomids fell between that of epilithon and green algae indicating that chironomids may be feeding on both resources. Adult chironomids captured in emergence traps placed over the stream had similar tracer 15N values as larvae collected from the benthos indicating that N uptake and export to the riparian zone was rapid.

Effect of growth at low atmospheric CO2 on plant photosynthetic tolerance of high temperatures. Our previous research has demonstrated for many plant species that growth at levels of atmospheric CO2 greater than current ambient (360 ppm) leads to increased high temperature tolerance of photosystem II. To test whether growth at levels of CO2 below current ambient also influences photosystem II thermotolerance, we grew plants of Cucumis sativus and Phaseolus vul garis at CO2 levels of 180, 280 and 360 ppm CO2. These represent Pleis tocene, recent pre-industrial and current atmospheric CO2 levels, respectively. Intact leaves from these plants were treated at temperatures ranging from 28 46 degrees C between thermostatted brass blocks, and PSII efficiency was measured using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. For Cucumis sativus, the efficiency of photosystem II following high temperature treatments dif fered for the three CO2 treatments with 360 &gt; 280 &gt; 180. These differences persisted for several days following heat shock. For Phaseolus vulgaris there was a similar difference in the thermotolerance of PSII among plants grown at the different levels of CO2, with 360 &gt; 280 = 180. TAYLOR, B. E.,' M. J. BROOKS2 and E.

Interpreting late Pleistocene and Holocene climatic records of Carolina bays on the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain. Organic sediments in Carolina bays, oriented basins common on upland sur faces of the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain, have yielded basal dates ranging 216 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="178">from late Pleistocene to mid-Holocene. These dates have been obtained over nearly half a century of research by more than a dozen investigators, includ ing ourselves. Although the basal dates have sometimes been interpreted as dating bay formation, most of them probably actually mark the onset of low energy conditions following an initial high-energy, open water phase of mor phological evolution. The climatic signals associated with these dates differ across regions of the Coastal Plain. In the Middle and Upper Coastal Plain, some late Pleistocene dates and pollen from bays correlate with periods of cooler, drier regional climate. In contrast, early to mid-Holocene basal dates of bays in the Lower Coastal Plain correlate with paludification due to rising water tables accompanying sea level rise, which was controlled mainly by global climate.

Linking species behavior and ecosystem pro cesses: Organism activity drives patterns of organic matter transport in streams. We asked whether behavioral activity of organisms affects ecosystems pro cesses. In neotropical streams with a diverse community of benthic-feeding fish, we examined the influence of fish activity on the diel pattern of organic matter transport in the natural stream, in experimental channels, and using particle surrogates released into the stream. In Rocky Mountain streams, we examined the influence of invertebrate behavior on organic matter transport in streams with and without predatory trout, in flow-though channels with chemical cues from trout added, and in whole-stream manipulations in which chemical cues were also added. In neotropical streams, organic matter trans port remained low during early morning hours, increased significantly during afternoon, and peaked in late evening. Field patterns of fish activity and experimental results indicate that activity of diurnal and nocturnal fish is correlated with organic matter transport. In the Colorado study, streams with trout had low transport during the day when the risk of fish predation was high. In contrast, greater transport was observed at night when invertebrate activity was highest and risk to fish predation was low. In fishless streams, invertebrate activity was aperiodic and transport did not change over 24 hours. Multiple years of data from the Venezuelan system suggest that fish have strong effects on the transport of organic matter dynamics through con sumption and behavioral mechanisms. In the Colorado system, with an ad ditional trophic level (predators), we observed cascading effects of predators on species behavior that indirectly affected the ecosystem process of organic matter transport.

Effect of tree species on nitrogen retention in the Catskill Mountains, NY: 15N Studies. This study examines the role that dominant tree species play in the nitrogen (N) retention of forested watersheds in the Catskill Mountains. These forests receive high rates of atmospheric N deposition causing export of increasing amounts of N to streams. There is a 27-fold difference in stream nitrate concentration among 39 watersheds even though N deposition is approxi mately uniform. To examine whether trees, and the soil microbes associated with them, vary in their capacity for N retention, we added a 15N tracer to four plots within stands of American beech, sugar maple and eastern hemlock during summer 1998. We collected soil from each of the 12 plots at 1, 3, 13 and 45 days following N addition. Per unit area, soils associated with hem lock had a significantly higher amount of total dissolved N, microbial bio mass N, root N (p&lt;O.O5) and microbial uptake of l5N (p&lt;0.O5). Total soil pools of N (per g soil and per unit area) in hemlock were more than two times higher than the amount found in sugar maple and American beech (p&lt;O.O5). These results suggest that soil pools of N are higher in soils as sociated with the evergreen tree species, hemlock, than those associated with the deciduous tree species, American beech and sugar maple. Results from this project will help determine the role that dominant tree species play in the N retention of watersheds. THALER, J. S. University of Toronto, Toronto, ON CANADA. Jasmonate mediated indirect plant defense against herbivores. Plant defenses can act directly by having a negative impact on herbivore preference or performance, or indirectly by enhancing the action of natural enemies. I have been investigating the role of jasmonic acid mediated plant responses in direct and indirect defense of tomato plants in the field. Jas monate-mediated induction of proteinase inhibitors and oxidative enzymes is associated with decreased preference and performance of several herbivores, and induction of volatiles is associated with increased abundance of parasit oids and mortality of lepidopteran larvae. In the current study, I show that jasmonate mediated responses have a negative impact on aphid populations, but this is not due to effects on natural enemies. Fewer syrphid fly eggs were found on induced plants compared to controls and aphid parasitism was unaffected by treatments. In a large-scale field cage experiment to test the slow growth-high mortality hypothesis for effects of parasitoids on caterpil lars, I found that induced plants supported fewer caterpillars (that grew more slowly than controls), but parasitism was unaffected by the slowed larval growth. When I standardized larval density, the effects of the parasitoids were the same: parasitoids killed herbivores, but did not kill more herbivores on induced plants. Thus, for this cage experiment, slow growth of larvae on induced plants did not result in higher mortality. THAXTON, J. M. and W J. PLA1T Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, U.S.A. Effects of fire intensity on shrub resprouting in pine savanna. We manipulated pre-fire fuel loads in an upland longleaf pine (Pinus pal ustris) savanna to test the hypothesis that local variation in fire intensity affects post-fire resprouting patterns of shrubs. Transects were established across elevational gradients from upper slopes to ravines along intermittent streams in a second growth savanna containing both native and exotic shrub species. Shrub species composition and ramet density were determined in randomly selected 1m2 plots within transects both before and 2 months after early growing season fires in spring 1999. Prior to the fires each plot was randomly assigned one of four fuel load treatments. Treatments consisted of fine fuel removal, pine needle addition, wood addition and control. During fires, maximum fire temperatures were recorded in each treatment plot. Max imum fire temperatures were significantly higher in pine needle and wood addition plots than in control or fuel removal plots. For all species pooled, post-fire stem density was significantly lower in needle addition and wood addition than in control plots. Stem density did not differ significantly be tween fuel removal plots and control plots. Post-fire stem density was re duced below that of pre-fire levels only for wood addition plots. Patterns to the post-fire resprouting of individual species appeared to be related to the morphology of underground resprouting organs. While post-fire stem density of all species tended to be reduced in needle addition and wood addition plots relative to control plots, these effects were more pronounced for species that resprout from root crowns. Also, post-fire densities for both native and exotic root crown species tended to be reduced below pre-fire levels in both needle addition and wood addition plots. Post-fire densities of rhizomatous species differed among some treatments but tended to be significantly higher than pre-fire densities. These results suggest that local variation in fire inten sity as a result of heterogeneous fuel loads may affect shrub community dynamics in pine savannas. Furthermore, the response of shrub species to fire intensity variation may be somewhat predictable as a function of the morphology of their underground organs. THEIMER, T. C. Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011. Seed, cache and seedling shadows of an Australian tropical rainforest tree dispersed by white-tailed rats. The role of white-tailed rats (Uromys caudimaculata) as dispersers of seeds of the Australian tropical rain forest tree Beilschmedia bancroftii was inves tigated by following the fates of seeds and seedlings over two years. During a mast year, white-tailed rats cached seeds an average of 1 3m from parent trees in a variety of microsites, but neither distance of cache from parent nor microsite affected the length of time seeds remained in caches. Although none of the 61 cached seeds followed in this study survived to germination, comparison of seed, cache and seedling shadows suggested that most seed lings arose from rat-cached seeds. White-tailed rats cached seeds in both Oral Presentation Abstracts 217</page><page sequence="179">mast and non-mast years, but the time seeds remained on the forest floor and in caches was significantly shorter in non-mast years, suggesting that synchronous seed production increases the probability that some caches sur vive to germination. Because white-tailed rats are the most common and widespread native mammal capable of dispersing large seeds, this study sug gests that they could play an important role in the seed and seedling dynamics of Australian tropical rain forests. THERRIAULT, T W McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. Com munity persistence at different temporal intervals independent of spatial location. The relationship among aquatic communities within a restricted geographical area is examined over different temporal intervals. By evaluating the rela tionship among pool communities over time rather than the relationship be tween pool communities at distinct times, a different pattern of temporal dynamics emerges. Environmental variability is suggested as a contributing factor in temporal patterns of community persistence. Community patterns were evaluated using invertebrate communities collected from 13 freshwater Jamaican rock pools at time intervals of 2 weeks, 6 months, and 1 to 8 years. Calculating the absolute difference in Jaccard's Similarity Index (JSI), So renson's Similarity Index (SSI), the complemented coefficient of community (CD), and the number of common species between pool-pairs, over different time intervals, assessed community persistence independently of spatial lo cation. The absolute difference in SSI and CD were smallest for the shortest temporal interval, 2 weeks, but the other measures of persistence were not statistically significant. However, when environmental differences among pools were included in the analyses, the absolute difference in SSI and JSI were smallest for the shortest temporal interval. In general, there was a neg ative relationship among absolute differences in community metrics and dif ferences in pool conditions (i.e. temperature or salinity). Results showed that biotic determinants might be more important for determining the persistence of communities than environmental variables, especially in a tropical system. THOMPSON, H. C.,1 S. T A.

Light environment controls of native and exotic vine growth. Exotic vines are abundant in urban forest gaps along the East Coast and thus are integral in gap regeneration. By comparing growth of exotic and native vines in different light environments we investigate the potential for exotic vines to alter native gap regeneration processes. We compared growth, al location pattern and nutrient content of three exotic vines; Ampelopsis brev ipedunculata, Celastrus orbiculatus, and Lonicera japonica, and two native vines; Parthenocissus quinquefolia and Vitis vulpina. Vines were grown in four light environments using a factorial design in which high and low light levels were crossed with heterogeneous(constructed gap) and homogeneous (shadehouse) light availability patterns. A. brevipedunculata and V. vulpina had the highest relative growth rates, followed by L. japonica. These three species had a greater number of branches per stem and the higher carbon: nitrogen ratios. A. brevipedunculata and V. vulpina produced the greatest leaf areas. Exotic species did not differ from natives in one specific strategy, instead each exotic exhibited a unique suite of traits. The exotics, A. brevi pedunculata and L. japonica had the greatest length, and exotic species had the greatest relative increases in root biomass. Exotics were morphologically plastic for most traits measured, while the abundant native V. vulpina was not. Exotic vines species should be evaluated individually to determine their affect on gap regeneration. THORNBER, C. S. and S. D. GAINES. University of California, Santa Bar bara, CA 93106 USA. Population dynamics of species with haploid-dip loid life cycles. Traditionally, investigations of population dynamics have focused upon spe cies with diploid life cycles; the dynamics of species with more complex lifecycles (containing multiple separate individuals) have been mostly over looked. Here, we examined the haploid-diploid cycle, one type of complex life cycle that obligately alternates between independent, free living haploids and diploids. The null model we constructed predicts that, given equal de mographic rates for the two forms, populations will contain 59% haploids and 41% diploids at equilibrium, not the traditionally assumed 1:1 ratio. We compared our predictions with patterns found in the field by conducting surveys of populations of three intertidal macroalgal species. Two species are located on the western coast of North America, Mazzaella flaccida and M. splendens, and one is found on the western coast of South America, M. laminarioides. The pattern of haploid dominance exhibited by M. splendens (66%) is fairly similar to our null model prediction; however, the mean hap loid abundances of M. flaccida (73%) and M. laminarioides (75%) were significantly greater. We found no indication of a geographical gradient or an effect of seasonality on the relative abundance of haploids. The over whelming dominance of haploid individuals indicates that there may be sig nificant ecological differences between the two forms. This may result from either a haploid advantage due to increased survivorship, or a haploid dis advantage due to decreased fecundity, or both. THORNTON, P. E.,I S. W. RUNNING' and V.

Relationship between decadal anom alies in climate and model-estimated AET, NPP, total carbon, and net ecosystem carbon exchange, 1895-1993: Results from VEMAP Phase 2. Thanks to the combined efforts of the VEMAP Phase 2 group, we have available gridded datasets of surface weather conditions and the results of terrestrial ecosystem simulations from six models with very different repre sentations of biogeochemical processes. We present a summary of the VE MAP results for the period of historical record, 1895-1993, aggregated to the annual and decadal level, for a region covering the conterminous United States. We explored the relationships between climate anomalies and simu lated surface process anomalies at the decadal scale. Our objective was to describe the patterns in these relationships for each model, and to compare these patterns between models. The purpose of such comparisons was to identify ecosystem processes for which different simulation approaches give significantly different results, and to further identify the climate drivers that were of greatest importance for different approaches. We found that model estimates of actual evapotranspiration (AET) have very similar responses to climate anomalies, and that simple regressions with climate anomalies can explain most of the variability in AET at the decadal scale. Relationships between climate and estimated net primary production (NPP) were less sim ilar between models, and simple regressions captured substantially less var iability in the decadal NPP estimates. Climate effects on net ecosystem ex change of carbon (NEE) were quite variable between models, and were weak for most models in most vegetation types. Anomalies in precipitation and radiation anomalies were more highly correlated with NEE than were anom alies in temperature and humidity. Drier vegetation types showed generally stronger relationships between NEE and climate anomalies than did wetter types. The implication of these results is that predictability in net ecosystem fluxes of carbon does not necessarily follow from the predictability of other important ecosystem water and carbon flux processes. This result has im portance for the assessment and monitoring of terrestrial sources and sinks of carbon under variable climatic conditions. THROOP, H. and M. LERDAU.

Atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen is leading to increased nitrogen availability in many terrestrial systems. Deposition-induced changes in nitro gen availability can alter plant growth, physiology, and reproduction. In ad dition, deposition-induced changes in plant tissue chemistry can affect pat terns of insect herbivory. We used common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia (Asteraceae), to examine the influence of simulated nitrogen deposition on the chemical composition of leaf tissue, phloem sap, and xylem sap, and on patterns of photosynthesis, growth, and reproduction. In addition, we inves tigated the influence of simulated deposition and subsequent changes in plant tissue chemistry on patterns of herbivory by a folivorous beetle (Coleoptera: Ophraella communa) and a phloem-feeding aphid (Hemiptera: Uroleucon ambrosiae). Increased simulated nitrogen deposition led to lower leaf C:N, higher photosynthetic rates, and greater biomass accumulation in the absence of herbivory. Altered nitrogen availability also affected patterns of insect herbivory, although the magnitude to which insects were affected was con tingent upon the tissue type upon which herbivores fed. 218 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="180">TIAN, H.,2 H.

Carbon storage in the US 1895-1993. North America plays a disproportionate role in global fossil fuel emissions, and some analyses of atmospheric carbon dioxide suggest it may also play a major role in ecosystem storage of carbon. The Vegetation and Ecosystem Modeling and Analysis Project used a set of state-of-the-art ecosystem mod els to simulate the response of carbon storage in the US to climate and increasing CO2 from 1895-1993. We combined process models with exten sive new data to analyze the carbon budget of the natural and agricultural ecosystems of the conterminous US. Models were integrated using a new historical climate database, historical and satellite-based land cover and ag ricultural statistics. We also synthesized the results of recent inventory-based estimates of carbon storage, which suggest a sink of approximately 0.3 Gt per year (+/- 100%). The results show that increasing CO2 has led to modest increases in carbon storage (-0.1 Gt per year in the 1980s, +/-25%). The rate of carbon uptake varied significantly with climate over the century with periods of both loss and accumulation. Over the period 1980-1993 the flux varied by -100% showing a strong influence of interannual climate vari ability. The drought of 1988 played a particularly significant role; El Nino effects are also evident. Short-term measurements could be in error in ap proximating long-term fluxes by 100% or more and could even infer the wrong sign. This is of great significance in using measurements of carbon fluxes in climate-change policy measures and land management. Ecological measurements sustained for ten or more years are required to detect critical biogeochemical phenomena. Agricultural lands played a modest role in recent decades, neither losing nor gaining substantial amounts of carbon, as is ex pected in the absence of positive measures to increase soil carbon storage. Inventory estimates of carbon storage are consistently larger than our best estimate of the CO2 effect, suggesting that carbon storage due to forest re growth is equal to 100-200% of the direct CO2 effect. For the carbon cycle, the landscape effects of human disturbance may be larger than ecosystem physiological responses to the changing environment. TIAN, H.,' J. M. MELILLO,' D. W KICKLIGHTER,' A.

Terrestrial carbon dynamics in North America from 1860 to 1992: Quantifying mechanisms responsible for carbon sink. The magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink in North America (&gt;150N) re mains uncertain. Estimates on carbon storage based on forest inventories are about a factor of six smaller than the estimate based on inverse modeling by Fan et al. in 1998. However, neither inverse modeling nor forest inventories identify the mechanisms underlying their estimates of the North American carbon sink. In this study, we investigate how climate variability, increasing CO2 and land-use change have affected carbon storage in North America during 1860-1992, by using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM). Our modeled results indicate that during 1860-1992 a combination of increasing C02, climate variability and land-use change causes a 5.4% (12.6 Pg C) decrease in terrestrial carbon storage in North America. The carbon dynamics in North America exhibited a large decrease from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, followed by a slow recovery. The large decrease in carbon storage during the first period is primarily due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to croplands. The slow recovery of carbon storage during the second time period is primarily due to increasing CO2 and regrowth of natural vegetation after agricultural abandonment. Our modeled results also indicate that net carbon storage shows substantial interannual variations, ranging from a 1.4 Pg C per year net efflux to a 0.8 Pg C per year uptake. Simulated net carbon storage also shows substantial spatial variations across the North America. Thus proper scaling of the site-specific measurements of carbon fluxes from eddy covariance or other atmospheric techniques to pro duce regional estimates must take into account temporal and spatial variations in net carbon storage. Our modeled estimate for a carbon dioxide/climate/ land use sink in North America during 1980-1992 is closer to forest inven tory estimates, but much lower than the estimate by Fan et al. in 1998.

Water source use of a riparian tall grass, big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii), along a gradient of depth to groundwater and rainfall regime in southeastern Arizona USA. Riparian grasslands dominated by big sacaton, a warm season perennial bunchgrass, were abundant in the southwest before the turn of the century, occupying millions of acres of floodplain habitat. These grasslands played important ecological functions by controlling erosion, intercepting and re taining sediment, and promoting groundwater recharge. Today, these grass lands cover less than 5% of their historical extent. There is growing interest in the conservation and restoration of big sacaton, yet little is known about the ecology of this important grassland species. Effective conservation and management of big sacaton grasslands will depend on a strong base of eco logical knowledge. Recent studies by the authors have begun to elucidate how big sacaton interacts with its environment (i.e. plant-soil-hydrology re lationships). An important and heretofore unstudied aspect of its ecology is the source(s) from which it derives moisture for maintenance and survivor ship. This research attempts to answer the following questions: 1) Does big sacaton utilize shallow soil moisture from precipitation, moisture provided by groundwater, or both, and; 2) Is utilization of these water sources influ enced by site conditions? Stable isotope technology is being used to deter mine the water source(s) utilized by big sacaton at five grassland sites with different groundwater conditions and rainfall regimes. Natural abundance ra tios of isotopes of hydrogen ('H and 2H) and oxygen (160 and 180) are being used to determine its source waters. At each grassland, tissue samples were collected from six big sacaton growing in an area of representative cover and density. Soil samples were collected from three cores at depths of 5,10,15,30,60 and 100 cm. Precipitation samples were collected from stan dard raingages containing a layer of mineral oil and groundwater samples were collected from local wells. Preliminary results of 180 analysis indicate big sacaton derives water solely from precipitation at a site where depth to groundwater exceeds 10 meters. At a location where depth to groundwater averages approximately 4 meters, big sacaton appear to use rainfall derived soil moisture and groundwater. These early results suggest big sacaton may use rainwater and/or groundwater depending on site conditions. TINKER, D. B.,' M. G. TURNER' and W H.

Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests dominated much of the landscape that burned in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in 1988. Many of these trees produce serotinous cones, which do not open under normal conditions, but require high temperatures such as intense fires produce, to release their seeds. The occurrence of serotinous cones on some lodgepole pines was an important factor in determining post-fire pine seedling density in regenerating lodgepole stands. Our earlier estimates of the proportion of pre-fire serotinous trees across the YNP landscape ranged from near zero to over 80 percent. Where serotiny was high, post-fire seedling density was also high (up to 450,000/ha); where serotiny was very low, little seedling regen eration has occurred, even in stands that were previously forested. Thus, the density of serotinous cone-bearing trees is highly variable across the Yellow stone landscape, but little is known regarding the factors controlling the pro duction of serotinous cones. We measured the percentage of serotinous trees in 63 unburned lodgepole pine stands in YNP that differed by age (&lt;200 yr vs. &gt;200 yr), substrate (infertile rhyolite vs. fertile andesite), and elevation (&lt; 2300m vs. &gt; 2300m). The percentage of serotinous trees was signifi cantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in stands growing at elevations below 2300m than at higher elevations. Serotiny was also generally higher in younger stands than in older stands, although the difference was not significant. Understand ing the occurrence of serotiny is necessary for predicting post-fire succes sional heterogeneity in YNP. The broad-scale variation in serotiny played a large role in producing a new landscape in which lodgepole pine stands of varying density will likely influence ecological processes for many years.

Morphological defenses against fish predation-A key factor for the suc cess of an invading species? A remarkable feature of cladocerans is their morphological plasticity. Daph nia lumholtzi is the cladoceran species which forms the most pronounced helmets and tail spines. Its native range are tropical and subtropical lakes in East Africa, Australia, and the Indian subcontinent. However it appeared in Texas in 1990 and has since spread to many North American lakes and stream systems. Biological invasions focus the attention of scientists both on the conservation issues and the chance to study non-equilibrium competitive interactions and the factors which allow for successful invasions of non native species. Helmets and tail spines in D. lumholtzi are inducible by chem icals associated with the presence of fish. Different clones isolated from North America exhibit a surprisingly large clonal diversity in their ability to form helmets, ranging from non-helmeted, non-inducible clones through in ducible clones to clones with permanent, large helmets. Predation experi ments with both morphs of D. lumholtzi showed that the helmets act as defense against both small and larger fish. Additionally the helmets offer protection against invertebrate predation. D. lumholtzi is the only cladoceran species so far which forms distinct inducible morphological defenses against fish predators. This defense is an advantage compared to native cladoceran species and is possibly an important factor behind its successful invasion into North America. TONITTO, C. and T. M. POWELL.

This modeling study examines the influence of local heterogeneity in plant and soil properties on the aggregate behavior of biogeochemical cycles. Bi otic controls on biogeochemical processes lead to non-linear model systems. In non-linear systems, the scale of process representation significantly influ ences whole-system dynamics. This is especially relevant in biogeochemical systems, where processes interact on spatial and temporal scales spanning several orders of magnitude. Model non-linearity and scale diversity com plicates the application of empirical results to regional and global model systems. In order to address biogeochemical scaling relationships, this work develops two strategies for defining nitrogen movement between plant-soil microbe phases. In one model, nitrogen transformations are described mech anistically based on microbial processes. In an alternative paradigm, nitrogen transformations are governed by both hydrologic dynamics as well as mi crobial processes. Equations for the homogeneous model systems are devel oped spatially to include horizontal heterogeneity in plant-soil properties and to model horizontal fluxes in solute transport. These spatial models are pa rameterized to study nitrogen movement in Douglas-fir forests of western Oregon. We explore the influence of spatial scale on nutrient distribution through perturbation analysis at different spatial resolutions. Perturbation sce narios correspond to biomass harvest, soil degradation and fertilization. The results show that in the microbially-driven model, the time-scale of the return to equilibrium is on the order of a generation of an unharvested forest, and the spatial differences in plant-soil nutrient distributions diminish during the return to steady state. In contrast, the hydrologic model system remains at the perturbed levels, and the heterogeneity in nutrient distribution remains a distinct feature of the system. These results demonstrate that biogeochemical predictions differ widely based on assumptions regarding both model devel opment and spatial scale. TONT, S. A.

Anthropomorphism, attribution of human characteristics or behaviour to plants, animals and inanimate objects, is a literary device used by a number of well known authors. On the literary front Joseph Conrad's reminiscences of ships and Herman Melville's philosophical musings about the whale are stellar examples of this technique. In ecology, one of the most notorious practitioners of anthropomorphism has been Linneaus whose descriptions of plant life probably would have been censored in a today's high-school ecol ogy text, eg. "Twenty males or more in the same bed with a female", "Her beauty is preserved oniy so long as she remains a virgin", etc. Anthropo morphism, often bordering on pretentious metaphor, has been a pervasive feature of Victorian natural history writing. However, if dispensed in right dosage and applied sparingly as one finds in the natural history essays of Henry David Thoreau and Aldo Leopold anthropomorphism can be a pow erful tool for communicating important ecological concepts and ideas. From a psychological point of view anthropomorphism can be viewed as a charm ing defiance against a purely mechanistic-materialistic view of nature. TOURENQ, C.,12 R. E. BENNETTS,1 F MESLEARDI and J.

Importance of rice fields for waterbirds in the Camargue wetland complex, southern France. The loss of natural wetlands throughout the Mediterranean Region, correlated with human population growth, urbanisation and conversion of land to ag riculture, made rice fields attractive for waterbird species of national or in ternational conservation concern. The Camargue, southern France, is a wet land complex comprising 145,000 ha renowned for its important numbers of wintering and breeding waterbirds. Since the Second World War, an intensive use of the land has replaced an extensive use for grazing cattle and horses, some 40 000 ha of the natural wetlands being converted into rice fields and industrial zones. However, compared to other intensive rice cultivation areas in Europe, such as the Po Valley in Italy or the Ebro Delta in Spain, natural wetlands still cover a good proportion of the surface (40%) of the Camargue compared to rice fields(16%). In this study, we explore the question of the importance of these artificial wetlands for waterbirds within the Camargue landscape mosaic. Using a one-year data set, we first compared the diversity and richness of waterbirds communities in rice fields and natural marshes, and secondly, we investigated the selection of natural marshes and rice fields by waterbirds. We observed about 50% fewer bird species in rice fields than in natural marshes. The relative species richness is greater in natural marshes than in rice fields. In spring, however, richness of both habitats is comparable. This is mainly due to waders and larids which use rice fields at the beginning of flooding in early breeding season. Our results suggest that when they have the choice, waterbirds avoid rice fields and select natural wetlands. Only herons show a significative selection for rice fields throughout the year.

Bio geochemical patterns along gradients in soil type and land use history in southwestern Costa Rica: Comparisons to the central Amazon. Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula presents a unique opportunity to explore biogeo chemical dynamics in sites that include pristine moist tropical forests, active cattle pastures, and secondary forests with a range of prior land use histories. All of these vegetation types can be found on soils that range from old, highly weathered ultisols, to younger, nutrient- and organic matter-rich al luvial mollisols, to highly sandy soils derived from former beach ridges. We collected a variety of biogeochemical data in sites representing both soil type and land use gradients, including: total soil C, N and P, soil exchangeable nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium and potassium, foliar concentrations of N, P and all base cations in pasture grasses and selected forest leaves, and soil P fractions as determined by a modified Hedley pro cedure. Like many tropical systems on old soils, sites on ultisols suggest very low levels of plant-available P, while the lowland alluvial soils are comparatively rich in P and in all other nutrients analyzed. Like a set of forest-pasture age gradients we have previously studied in the central Ama zon, we found strong decreases in labile forms of P with pasture age on the ultisols, but did not find a similar pattern in alluvial pastures. Moreover, unlike the Amazonian sites, there was little suggestion of significant decreas es in total soil P with pasture age. In part, this difference may be due to the fact that repeated pasture burning is not common in this region of Costa Rica. Finally,unlike the old oxisols in the Amazonian sites, the oldest soils in the Costa Rican sites showed relatively high levels of all base cations, as did pasture grasses growing on these soils. Although the ultisols are highly weathered and therefore might be expected to be poor in all rock-derived nutrients, the high base cation levels are probably due to a combination of the original parent material and the proximity of all our sites to the Pacific Ocean. 220 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="182">TRESEDER, K.

Alteration of soil car bon by communities of mycorrhizal fungi in a chaparral ecosystem ex posed to elevated CO2. We examined the potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi to increase soil carbon storage under elevated atmospheric CO2 in a chaparral system at the Sky Oaks Field Station in southern California. With antisera labeling, we assessed the community composition and total lengths of live AM hyphae associated with soil macroaggregates under varying CO2 levels. We then used stable isotopes to calculate C input to these macroaggregates. Carbon con centrations and AM hyphal lengths were correlated (P &lt; 0.06) and rose 30 fold (P &lt; 0.05) and 10-fold (P &lt; 0.01), respectively, between the 250- and 650-ppm treatments. The AM genera Scutellospora and Acaulospora re sponded strongly and positively to CO2 concentration, while Glomus and Gigaspora did not. AM fungi appear to increase macroaggregate-C under CO2 enrichment, possibly due to changes in community structure as well as stimulation of hyphal production. The C content of bulk soil may rise as macroaggregates disintegrate and release C into other soil fractions. TROTTER III, R. T, N. S. COBB and T G. WHITHAM.

Climatic sensitivity of pinyon pine as a predictor of resistance to insect herbivory: An integration of dendro chronology and a long-term insect removal experiment. Using dendrochronological data and a 14-year insect removal experiment we examine how the environmental sensitivity of individual trees predicts their susceptibility to chronic attack by the Pinyon Needle Scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus). Several key findings emerge: First, our data indicate that chronic infestation by scales reduces annual ring growth by 37%. Second, long-term removal of the scales results in an increase in ring growth, such that suscep tible growth mirrors that of resistant trees. This system is among the first to experimentally demonstrate a 'herbivore signal' in a dendrochronological re cord. Third, new to this study is the indication that inherently resistant trees demonstrate 68-fold greater inter-annual variation in ring growth during the experimental period, relative to susceptible trees. Removal of the scales from susceptible trees results in 1.6 fold increase in inter-annual ring width vari ation. While this experimental increase in inter-annual variability during the experimental period indicates some herbivore impact on host climatic sen sitivity, the diminutive level of increase following herbivore removal indi cates there are inherent differences in climatic sensitivity between resistant and susceptible trees. The differences between resistant an susceptible trees highlight the need to better understand within population variation in envi ronmental sensitivity and host herbivore interactions in the reconstruction of past climate, and suggest a mechanism for predicting relative regional sus ceptibility to outbreaks. TU, M. University of California, Davis, CA 95616. Riparian vegetation succession along the Cosumnes River, California. Vegetation dynamics of a forest riparian system was studied from 1995 to 1998 in California's Central Valley. Non-metric multidimensional scaling re vealed that each of four sampled (variable-aged) sites can be delimited by species composition alone into distinct successional stages.The establishment of all vascular plant species was followed on a newly formed sandbar, created following an intentional levee breach onto an abandoned field, from 1996 to 1998 using belt-transects. There was an overall trend towards greater species diversity and a divergence of vegetation composition (increase in permanent plot dissimilarity) with time. Successional species were primarily native woody plants, and equal numbers of native and exotic herbs. Comparing the sandbar site with older forests (established 11 to 14, 30 to 39, and 60 to 64 years earlier), the oldest stand had higher total species diversity than inter mediate stands, but not different than that of the sandbar stage of succession. Native species diversity, however, increased over time and contributed more and more to total diversity. Relative cover of native species also increased with time. The year-to-year fluctuations of the abundant native annuals Bi dens frondosa and Xanthium strumarium however, may be a confounding factor in the understanding of the dynamics of this system.

Statistical thinking and eoclogical release: More on the weight of evi dence. Statistical thinking is essential to getting an understanding of ecological phe nomena. It is more than methods for data analysis. It is a paradigm for prospective data designs and for weighing the empirical evidence. An im portant and global ecological problem is that of ecological release, i.e. what to do about the introduction of non-native species which threaten by preda tion and competition, the ultimate demise of native flora and fauna. Statistical thinking in the form of an a priori power analysis was provided to ecologists studying the non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta) and its potential to prey upon native Utah fish species to extinction. A sampling plan was recom mended and implemented in a study sponsored by the Provo River Mitigation Project, Utah. In addition to a randomized blocking factor, a habitat com plexity covariate was used to model the effects of predator size and abun dance on prey mortality. Weighing the evidence with effective data displays shows that juvenile survival in native fish may depend on the availability of refugia. Recommendations are provided to investigators that will reduce the variation in subsequent experiments, improve statistical power, and add more weight of evidence for taking potent action to restore the Provo River.

Modeling restoration of Michigan tributaries and its effect on sal monid populations. Damming of Great Lakes tributaries has fragmented spawning and nursery habitats for anadromous fishes and fundamentally altered the physical and chemical properties of these important aquatic environments. Changes in riv er morphology, flow, substrate and water temperature imposed by dams may reduce the reproductive potential of salmonids and lower parr growth and survival. Dams impede fish migration to suitable spawning grounds, reduce the quantity of suitable spawning habitat, and degrade productive nursery areas for parr growth and survival. Remarkably little attention has been paid to evaluating the effects that dams and their management have on salmonid populations. Here, we present a spatially-explicit, individual-based model (IBM) of salmonids in tributaries to Lake Michigan. The model simulates the period from adult spawning through the smolt stage. Simulated parr for age and grow according to well accepted models and select habitat using fitness based rules. Adult spawning and parr survival follow size-based rules derived from data. The spatially-explicit tributary environment allows sim ulations to explore the effect of environmental change on the salmonid pop ulation. Simulation results show that changes in water temperature and sub strate affect salmonid population abundance and distribution and that their effects interact with salmonid density. TYRE, A. J.,' H.

Can static habitat models recover pro cess information? Habitat models are widely used in wildlife ecology to identify good habitat for conservation actions like reservation. These models are usually based on correlations between species presence or abundance, and habitat character istics like vegetation, geomorphology, or climate. Habitat models contain no temporal component. However, habitat quality for conservation is best mea sured as the population growth rate - the difference between birth and death rates. Good quality habitat is habitat that allows a positive population growth rate, at least at low population densities. We test the ability of static habitat modelling to recover information about habitat quality with a spatially ex plicit, individual based simulation with a fractal landscape. The advantage of a fractal landscape is that the amount of spatial autocorrelation in habitat characteristics is completely controllable. Only a single habitat characteristic influences either survival or fecundity, and hence habitat quality, on the frac tal landscape. Our 'virtual ecologist' randomly samples territories on the landscape and records whether or not the territory is occupied and what the local habitat characteristic is. The virtual ecologist makes no sampling errors, and measures the only habitat characteristic that influences habitat quality. We find that even under these ideal circumstances, a static habitat model can Oral Presentation Abstracts 221</page><page sequence="183">only explain about 50% of the variation in territory occupancy; the unex plained variation is a consequence of demographic stochasticity alone. We find that the probability of dispersing to a site has a greater influence on whether or not it is occupied by a species than the quality of the site. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of habitat models based on static correlations, and the value of traditional habitat models for wildlife conservation. UMBANHOWAR, J. and A. HASTINGS. University of Californa,Davis, CA 95616 USA. The impact of parasitoids and plant spacing on the spread of insect outbreaks. Many factors control the spatial spread and temporal persistence of outbreaks of insect herbivores. Especially important are the distribution of host plants and natural enemies. Populations of Orgyia vetusta exhibit multi-generation al, spatially limited outbreaks whose spread is limited by parasitoids. We describe and analyze a model based on the biology of 0. vetusta. There are four major results of this analysis. First, we find that the spread of an outbreak is greatly slowed by the presence of wide ranging parasitoids. Second, in contrast to similar models where herbivore and parasitoid have overlapping generations, the spread of an outbreak through a continuously distributed host plant cannot be prevented, regardless of the movement abilities of her bivore or parasitoid. Third, if plants are considered to be discrete patches, outbreak spread can be prevented by sufficient inter-plant distance. Fourth, the model predicts the outbreak will collapse, due to overexploitation by parasitoids after reaching a critical size. Observational data are consistent with the third and fourth prediction. URIARTE, M. and R. B. ROOT Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853. Herbivore tolerance and competitive ability in two goldenrod (Solidago altissima, L) populations with different history of herbivory. The special conditions created by a long-term experiment on the effects of removing insects from goldenrod provided an exceptional opportunity to ex amine whether or not insect herbivores can act as agents of natural selection for plant tolerance to insect damage in natural communities. By comparing plant genotypes from experimental plots where insects have been excluded for the past 18 years with genotypes collected in adjacent, untreated plots, we determined whether insects have selected for more herbivore-tolerant ge notypes and if there are tradeoffs in competitive ability associated with the loss of tolerance. In 1998, we collected genotypes from experimental plots and transferred them to a common garden to promote their establishment. In 1999 we dug up the plants, divided them into 4 clones and transplanted them into a mature goldenrod field where each genotype was subjected to the following 4 treatments: Control, no competition, no insect damage and no competition or insect damage. We compared herbivore abundance, flowering, survivorship and physiological traits of the 2 historical treatments across the 4 experimental treatments. Although plants from both historical treatments had similar numbers of herbivores during the summer of 1999, genotypes that were free of herbivores during the last 18 years were less likely to flower and more likely to die in response to herbivore attack than those genotypes from plots that had experienced normal levels of herbivory. In addition, plants that had been free of herbivores for the last 18 years differed in their physiological response to insect damage. Plants subject to natural herbivory during the past 18 years allocated more N to leaves in response to insect damage than those in which herbivores were suppressed, perhaps a compen satory response to the loss of leaf area to herbivores. The response to com petition also differed between the two historical treatments. Plants from his torical suppression plots had lower delta 13C and higher delta 15 N in response to competition than plants that had experienced normal herbivory levels, suggesting that plants from both historical treatments have diverged from each other in nutrient acquisition and assimilation. These physiological traits might be related to vegetative growth and competitive ability. URQUHA1RT, G. R. Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48825. Prehistoric hurricane disturbance and forest regeneration in Nicaragua. Chronological difficulties for the study of ecology, posed by infrequent phe nomena and slow processes, are overcome by the long-term coverage pos sible with paleoecological analyses. The regeneration of forests after a sto chastic disturbance is a slow process beyond the scope of real-time study, but amenable to study with paleoecological techniques. To study the regen eration of tropical forests after hurricane damage, I analyzed a 5 m sediment core from a swamp lagoon in Nicaragua. The core covered the entire 8,000 year history of the swamp. X-rays revealed two sand layers deposited by hurricanes, one at 3300 y BP and the other c. 2000 y BP Charcoal fragmetis and pollen analyses showed that the first of these layers was followed by fires and major changes in vegetation. This pattern was identical to that observed in the wake of Hurricane Joan, which struck in 1988 and left 90,000 ha of damaged swamp forest that burned shortly after. After the first prehis toric hurricane, forest vegetation did not return until 500 years later, due to repeated burning. This parallel event of the past illustrates a possible course for modern forest regeneration. As a counterpart to direct ecological analysis, fine-resolution paleoecological study can provide insight for the study of rare events and slow processes. VALENTINE, D. W. and R. D. BOONE. University of Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99775, USA. Response of boreal forest soil CO2 efflux to experi mental wildfire (Frostfire) in an interior Alaska watershed. We assessed the response of mid-day net soil CO2 efflux (respiration-pho tosynthesis) under two contrasting vegetation types to an experimental wild fire of moderate intensity as part of the Frostfire project. In 1998 and 1999, late growing season soil CO2 effluxes in three unburned replicate sites under mixed hardwood (MH; Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides) averaged 110-150 mg C m-2 h-1. These rates were 2-3 times higher than under closed canopy black spruce (CBS; Picea mariana and mixed shrubs). Growing sea son soil temperatures at any given depth were higher in MH than in CBS sites owing to an insulating moss layer, and peak correlations between CO2 efflux rates and soil temperatures occurred closer to the soil surface in MH than in CBS sites. In July 1999, the moderately intense fire killed all vege tation and thinned the CBS moss layer by an average of 5.5-6.5 cm. The fire halved soil CO2 effluxes from MH sites and reduced soil CO2 effluxes from burned CBS sites slightly but significantly (p&lt;0.05). Decreased CO2 efflux probably resulted from fire-induced cessation of root respiration rather than reduced decomposition in both MH and CBS vegetation types. The thinning of the CBS moss layer both reduced insulation and eliminated moss and herb photosynthesis; both may have contributed to offsetting root res piration declines. VAN ZANDT, P. A. and S. MOPPER. University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The influence of salinity and maternal environment on germination in Iris Hexagona. Whether a seed genninates and becomes established has important implica tions for the distribution of a plant species. A general paradigm in wetland plant communities is that perennial salt marsh species spread mainly by vegetative propagation, and that flowering and subsequent establishment of seedlings is rare. In salt marshes, salinity may act directly by decreasing germination rates as well as indirectly by altering seed provisioning from the maternal plant. Because salinity levels in salt marsh environments are fre quently correlated between plant generations, maternal effects might be both strong and adaptive. We examined both the direct and indirect (maternal) effect of salinity on seed germination rates of Iris hexagona, a perennial found in fresh and brackish marshes in the southeastern U.S. We obtained 5616 seeds from hand and bee pollinations of plants maintained in three salinity levels (0, 2, and 4 ppt), and planted them in a greenhouse at one of four salinity treatments (0, 3, 6, and 9 ppt). We found that seeds planted in elevated salinity experienced a direct abiotic effect, which significantly re duced both germination rate and number. However, salinity also stimulated seed germination via an indirect, maternal effect: Seeds from plants growing in high salinity germinated faster and at greater number than seeds from low salinity treatment plants.

Cambial heat re sistance in understory trees in Californian mixed conifer forests. An essential component to models of forest response to fire is an assessment of fire-caused cambial damage. Cambial heat resistance has been traditionally measured in large-sized overstory trees with thick bark, although juvenile 222 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="184">trees have thinner bark and therefore more sensitive to fire. We undertook this study to determine if current models of heat transfer are applicable to small-sized trees. We performed this work on four common species in mixed conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California; white fir (Abies concolor), incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), ponderosa pine (Pinus pon derosa) and douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). We found the allometric relationship between bole diameter and bark thickness for each species to be strongly linear (p&lt;0.01), even for very small sized trees (5 cm dbh). White fir had significantly thinner bark (p&lt;0.05) across the range of measured tree sizes than any of the other species. Our findings from experimental fire re sistance trials are in agreement with current models in so far as bark thickness alone is the crucial determinant of cambial heat resistance. However, between species differences are large and best explained in terms of species specific differences in bark moisture and density. Experimental trials also demonstrate that small-sized trees are more resistant to heating than is expected from existing models. Differences between observed and expected rates of cambial heating are explained by differences in bark anatomy between large and small sized trees. VAN KLEUNEN, M., M. FISCHER and B. SCHMID. Universitait Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. Costs of plasticity in foraging characteristics of the clonal plant Ranunculus reptans. In clonal plants, evolution of plastic foraging by increased lengths of leaves and internodes under unfavourable conditions may be constrained by costs and limits of plasticity. We studied costs and limits of plasticity in foraging characteristics in 102 genotypes of the clonal herb Ranunculus reptans. We grew three replicates of each genotype with and three without competition by the naturally co-occuripg grass Agrostis stolonifera. We used regression and correlation analyses to investigate potential costs of plasticity in leaf and internode length, developmental instability costs of these traits, and a devel opmental range limit of these traits. We used randomization procedures to control for spurious correlations between parameters calculated from the same data. Under competition the number of rosettes, of rooted rosettes, and of flowers was 58, 40, and 61 percent lower, respectively, than in the absence of competition. Under competition lengths of leaves and intemodes were 14 and 6 percent smaller, respectively, than in the absence of competition. We detected significant costs of plasticity in internode length in the presence of competition when fitness was measured in terms of the number of rosettes and the number of flowers (selection gradients against plasticity were 0.250 and 0.214, respectively). Within-environment variance in both foraging traits was not negatively correlated with the corresponding plasticity, which indi cates that there were no developmental instability costs. More plastic geno types did not have less extreme trait values than less plastic genotypes for both foraging traits, which indicates that there was no developmental range limit. We conclude that in R. reptans costs of plasticity more strongly con strain evolution of foraging in the horizontal plane (i.e. internode length) than in the vertical plane (i.e. leaf length). VAN AUKEN, 0. W The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78249-0662 USA. Are changes in belowground competition the cause of alteration in composition of semi-arid grasslands? The composition and structure of the semiarid grasslands of southwestern North America have changed over the past 150 years. Brush encroachment by native species has occurred over large areas. Mesquite, is one of the major woody species that has increased in density in these semiarid grasslands. Factorial field competition experiments in grasslands in central Texas suggest that the woody plants are not the cause of the changes in these semiarid grasslands, but they are the result of changes in other variables. Mesquite seedlings grown with established grasses are suppressed but some survive for two years. Clipping or simulated herbivory of the aboveground grass biomass reduced their belowground drymass. All woody seedlings in the grass clipping treatment survived and mesquite dry mass was 4-6 times higher compared to the no herbivory treatment. When competition was par titioned between above- and belowground, using netting and root excluders to reduce the grass interaction with the woody plants, belowground compe tition was more important in suppressing woody plant growth. Total mesquite dry mass was significantly, inversely related to grass root dry mass. Although grass plants reduce the growth of mesquite, apparently other factors such as fire are necessary to completely suppress the growth of mesquite in these grasslands. VANNI, M. J. and S. J. HARPER. Miami University, Oxford, OH 45056, U.S.A. Effects of omnivorous fish on the stability of aquatic food webs. Recent theoretical studies suggest that omnivory confers stability to food webs through the addition of weak- to moderate-strength trophic interactions. We conducted field studies to test predictions generated by this hypothesis. We assembled experimental food webs to resemble those found in reservoirs, systems that receive regular perturbations in the form of large pulses of nutrients following storm events. The omnivorous gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum, is an especially important component of reservoir food webs. By feeding on sedimented detritus and subsequently excreting nutrients, they provide a novel, steady source of nutrients to the grazer-based food web. Theory suggests that a large, steady supply of limiting nutrients can confer stability. Thus, we predicted that food webs with gizzard shad would be more resistant and resilient to nutrient pulses than would those without this om nivorous fish. In experimental ponds we established food webs with phyto plankton, zooplankton, planktivorous bluegill, and various densities of giz zard shad (none, low, moderate, and high). Following a 6-wk pre-manipu lation period, we perturbed ponds with a nutrient pulse over a 2-d period and then monitored responses of food webs over a 5-wk post-manipulation period. As predicted, food webs with gizzard shad as a dominant member showed increased resistance. Although all food webs responded to the per turbation with increased phytoplankton biomass and available nutrients, mod erate- and high-density shad treatments showed a much smaller increase than control and low-density shad treatments (1.5-fold vs. 4.0-fold increase, re spectively). In contrast to increased resistance, shad density did not affect resilience of these factors. Bluegill growth rates, zooplankton species rich ness, and primary production were largely unaffected by gizzard shad den sity. Additional studies are required to discern the underlying mechanism by which omnivorous gizzard shad confer resistance to food webs. VERVILLE, J. H.12 and C. B.

Biological N-fixation in California annual grassland: Responses to elevated C02 and effects on community productivity. The capacity of many terrestrial ecosystems to increase carbon uptake and storage under elevated atmospheric CO2 is influenced by the availability of limiting resources, particularly nitrogen (N). Biological N-fixation is a major source of N to many terrestrial systems, and the response of N-fixing organ isms to elevated CO2 is likely to affect N-availability. I measured the growth and N-fixation responses of two annual grassland legumes to elevated C02, and measured the effects of legume presence on community productivity and nutrient pools under ambient and elevated C02, and across range of N-ad dition levels. Elevated CO2 increased the growth of the legume Lotus wran gelianus, but did not significantly stimulate growth of the legume Vicia sa tiva, which was more abundant than L. wrangelianus in the communities. Nitrogen addition caused a decline in the biomass of both legume species. Elevated CO2 did not significantly affect total legume biomass or the amount of N fixed. Communities with legumes had 28-55% more N in aboveground plant tissue than communities without legumes, with the greatest difference at low N-addition. However, N pools in legume tissue more than accounted for the differences in total community N, suggesting that legume presence did not increase N availability to non-fixers. Total aboveground productivity was comparable in communities grown with and without legumes, and there was no difference between communities in how productivity responded to elevated CO2 or N addition.

The impact of spiders and carabid beetles on the abun dance of insect pests and potato yield. The extent to which spiders and carabid beetles limit populations of insect pests and enhance potato yield was determined in two different field exper iments conducted in consecutive years. The experiments employed a com bination of mulching, fencing, hand-removal, and live pitfall trapping (3 rep licates / treatment) to alter densities of indigenous spiders and carabid beetles that immigrate into gardens from surrounding habitats. In Year 1, Kennebac and Red Pontiac potatoes were planted with cucumbers and eggplant in 105 Oral Presentation Abstracts 223</page><page sequence="185">m2 plots. In Year 2, a monoculture of Kennebac potatoes was planted in 64 m2 gardens. In Year 1, densities of Colorado potato beetles (CPB) were 3x higher (p = 0.065) and yield of Kennebac potatoes was 35% lower (p = 0.082) in fenced, predator-reduction plots compared to open controls. These marginally significant effects disappeared in Year 2, when densities of CPB and potato yield were similar in fenced removal, fenced control and open control plots (p's &gt; 0.50). At least two factors likely contributed to the absence of control of CPB in Year 2: (1) predation by spiders and carabids also affected densities of several other predators of insect pests: predaceous damsel bugs, big-eyed bugs and lacewings; and (2) CPB densities in open control gardens were &gt;10x higher in Year 2 than the preceding year. Future studies are needed to quantify the indirect effects of spiders and carabids on other natural enemies, and to determine threshold densities of CPB below which spiders and carabids can limit densities of this major pest of potatoes. VINSON, M. R. and T A. CROWL. Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322, U.S.A. Predator-prey ratios: Multiple tests of the invariance rule. The number of predator and prey taxa in ecological communities have been observed to be highly correlated with the ratio of predators to prey and is largely invariant across taxa assemblages, community food webs, and dif ferent habitats. Based on more than 4600 samples collected in freshwater habitats across western North America and for ratios calculated for all North American freshwater insect genera we show that lentic habitats (wetlands, ponds and lakes) support more than twice as many insect predator taxa per insect prey taxa as do lotic habitats (fluvial springs and rivers). The numbers of predator and prey genera were highly correlated, but the mean predator prey ratio varied significantly and considerably between lentic and lotic hab itats. For field samples, the mean predator-prey ratio was 1. 160.07 SE, (0.9 prey genera per predator genera) for lentic habitats and 0.39?0.004 SE (2.6 prey genera per predator genera) for lotic habitats. For all North American aquatic insect genera, the ratios were: 1.13 for lentic habitats and 0.43 for lotic habitats. Lentic and lotic waters had similar numbers of genera classified as predators, but lotic waters had 2.3 times more genera classified as prey than did lentic waters. We suggest that differences in the predator-prey ratio between lentic and lotic waters are related to body size that promote different species compositions in response to hydrodynamic stresses and dispersal dy namics that affect rates of colonization and extinction.

Erosion and the regeneration of nutrient supply on an old tropical landscape. Stable constructional surfaces of shield volcanoes become increasingly de pleted in rock-derived nutrients over 4 million years of ecosystem develop ment in the Hawaiian Islands. At the same time, fluvial erosion reduces constructional surfaces to a progressively smaller fraction of the landscape. Does this erosion expose little-weathered rocks, and thereby rejuvenate the supply of rock-derived nutrients on slopes? We evaluated soil characteristics and foliar nutrients across erosional slopes and shield surfaces on the oldest Hawaiian island, Kauai. Isotopic analyses demonstrated that 5-8% of the Sr in plants on a shield surface-and 13-31% of the Sr on a slope-was derived from the underlying rock. Foliar P in the dominant tree species averaged 0.06% on shield surfaces, versus 0.081% on slopes. The matrix of nutrient depleted shield surfaces, rejuvenated slopes, and mixed depositional areas increases the biogeochemical diversity of landscapes on the oldest island, where species diversity also is highest. VOLDER, A. and D. M. EISSENSTAT. Pennsylvania State University, Uni versity Park, PA 16802, USA. Age dependent respiration of fine apple roots. The fine root system is a population of mixed-age individual roots that are responsible for the acquisition of water and nutrients. The efficiency (E) of a root to perform these tasks can be expressed as the ratio of nutrient gained per unit carbon expended. F changes with root age, due to changes in root physiology and soil nutrient depletion. We predict that the optimal lifespan of a root is that which maximizes E -roots will be shed when their costs start outweighing their benefits. A model has been developed to predict E under various environmental conditions where both root respiration and nu trient uptake are thought to decrease with root age. Earlier experiments using split-pot systems indicated that median root lifespan was approximately 40 to 60 days for apple seedlings grown under homogeneous N supply. When plants were grown with a heterogeneous N supply, the median lifespan of roots in a low-N patch was decreased, while roots growing in a high-N patch exhibited increased median lifespan, suggesting that plants do adjust root lifespan when E changes. However, even though the median lifespan was 40-60 days, a sizeable portion (20%) did not die within 200 days. Why? We examined respiration rates of individual fine roots ranging in age from 1 to 244 days grown under high, low, and heterogeneous N supply, using both intact and excised roots. While there was a correlation between root age and respiration for roots less than 30 days old, we found no age effect thereafter. Moreover, root diameter and pigmentation had no measurable ef fect on respiration. Excised roots measured within minutes after excision were a reasonable predictor of intact root respiration, except for roots re spiring at rates &gt;35 nmol 02 g-1 s-4, which were underestimated by excised roots. Our results suggest that the use of E as a predictor of root lifespan works well for the majority of apple roots (&lt;50 days old), but at the present time, we cannot explain why some fine roots live such a long time.

Eat green but not any green! Consequences of ungulate intro duction on an long-lived tree species. Forests on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (British Columbia, Canada) evolved for c. 10 000 years in the absence of large mammal browsing. The intro duction of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) from the main land c. 1910 provides an opportunity to evaluate changes in the adaptive defensive responses of plants to herbivory. Our preliminary study showed that Haida Gwaii redcedars (Thuja plicata) that have never been browsed by deer (old trees that grew before deer were introduced and nursery-grown seedlings) had less effective defences than mainland plants, whereas Haida Gwaii and mainland saplings had a similar vulnerability to deer. In this study we assessed whether there was variability in defences among Haida Gwaii saplings and if deer acted as a selective force by choosing saplings with lower defences. We compared heavily and lightly browsed saplings on Haida Gwaii in terms of (i) chemical defence (terpene concentrations) and (ii) age and growth patterns (dendroecology). In addition, we tested the effect of monoterpenes found in redcedar leaves by food choice experiments on deer and showed that the major monoterpene (thujone) was repulsive to deer. Heavily browsed saplings had lower monoterpene profiles but were the same age as lightly browsed saplings. This suggests that under the current browsing regime, individuals with the greatest constitutive defences, or with greatest potential for induced defences grow better and are therefore selected on Haida Gwaii.

Invasive species which assume dominant, destructive roles in their new com munities are often much less dominant in their native ranges. In many cases, invasive species are successful in new locales because they have left behind key competitors, predators, pathogens, or parasites. Although the Red Im ported Fire Ant Solenopsis wagneri has been a major pest invader in the US for over fifty years, to date no studies have comprehensively examined its ecological interactions in its native range in Brazil. In Brazil, the fire ant is a dominant competitor, and may be the most dominant ant in its preferred habitat of short grass. However, it does not achieve the levels of monodom inance that it does in the U.S. Instead, it shares both short and tall grass habitats with at least twenty other species of directly competing ants. In a four-year study, we examined three interacting factors that limit the fire ant in its native range: Competition, flooding, and parasitoids. The ants Cam ponotus rufipes and Paratrechina fulva are superior competitors to the fire ant, but prefer less-flooded locations with taller grass. Seasonal flooding forc es the movement of fire ant nests and intensifies competition between fire ants and superior ants by forcing them to occupy the same tall grass habitats 224 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="186">for part of the year. Flooding may also favor competitively inferior ants that can colonize short grass areas after floods more rapidly than fire ants. The presence of multiple species of species-specific phorid parasitoids restricts the foraging of fire ants and decreases their competitive ability. Here we evaluate of the importance of competitive superiors, flooding, and parasitoids to the limitation of the fire ant in its native range. WAGNER, H. H., J. M. BOSSENBROEK, M. M. HAWKS, B.

Species composition is influenced by a number of biotic and abiotic pro cesses. Their spatial structure and interaction creates what we observe as spatial autocorrelation in species composition. Spatial autocorrelation can pose severe problems to the estimation of community-environment relation ships and of interspecific associations. We show how variogram modeling can be used to separate the effects of environmental heterogeneity, species specific characteristics and interspecific interactions on plant species com position. We define the Community Variogram as an extension of the ordi nary semi-variogram to multivariate binary data such as a vector of presence absence data of species in a sampling unit. Point-wise division by the ex pected value leads to the definition of a Standard Community Variogram, which can be used to account for environmental heterogeneity. By fitting an appropriate variogram model, the distance-dependent coefficients of autocor relation and of interspecific association can be estimated and graphically interpreted. Partial variograms can be fitted for individual species or for func tional groups to derive group-specific parameters. We outline how the method can be applied in community and landscape ecology to address questions about the independence of sampling units, estimation in the presence of spa tial dependence, the effect of landscape structure on species distribution, differences in spatial autocorrelation between functional groups of species, and the existence of assembly rules. WAHL, E. R. University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN 55108 USA. Holocene paleoecology of Southern California: Methods, results, and testing of climate model simulations. A pollen-based paleoenvironmental record is developed from wet meadows in the Southern California mountains. The record focuses on time windows of 9-lOka, 6ka, and 3ka (14C years) , corresponding to early- and mid Holocene climate modelling experiments and to late-Holocene climate chang es recorded in coastal estuaries in the region. Pollen spectra from a regional network of surface samples are used to determine possible modern analogs for the fossil data; the surface samples are associated with specific temper ature and precipitation values determined from regional instrumental data. Analysis of the surface samples indicates that a cutoff value in the Square Chord Distance technique of -0.20 jointly minimizes the chance of either falsely accepting or falsely rejecting a particular surface sample as an analog. Preliminary results from analysis of the modern analogs "selected" by the fossil pollen indicate: 1) the early Holocene (near 9-lOka) was characterized by temperature and precipitation ranges similar to those of today; 2) the mid Holocene (near 6ka) was characterized by conditions slightly warmer and drier than today; and 3) the late Holocene (near 3ka) was characterized by conditions almost identical to today's. In the early Holocene, the fossil pollen assemblages do not contain significant percentages from regional dry-indi cating plants, making them unlike pollen spectra in the western Sierra Nevada during this period. Coupled with the analog analysis, these results strongly suggest that conditions in the Southern California mountains near 9-lOka were significantly more mesic (relative to today's climate) than conditions in the Sierra Nevada at this time. A N-S gradient of increased relative moisture from the Northern to Southern California mountains in the early Holocene is consistent with model simulations of an enhanced summer monsoon and slightly enhanced coastal winter precipitation in the American Southwest at this time. The slightly drier-than-present conditions inferred for the mid Ho locene are consistent with a possible eastward shift of the monsoon in one set of model simulations, but are not well-explained by a second set of simulations in which the monsoon does not shift and summer and annual precipitation and surface wetness are all increased over their early Holocene levels.

If changes in the composition of the soil microbial community alter the physiological capacity of the plant community then such changes may have ecosystem consequences. We characterized microbial community parameters in soils from tropical forest (C3) and pineapple plantation soils (CAM) of different ages in Tahiti. We examined the relationships among community composition (PLFA), microbial biomass (CFDE), substrate utilization profiles (Biolog), lignocellulose degrading enzyme activities (3-glucosidase, cello biohydrolase, ,B-xylosidase, phenol oxidase, peroxidase), and nutrient releas ing enzyme activities (phosphatase, sulfatase). The natural isotopic gradient from C3 to CAM allowed us to analyze the dl3C values of microbial phos pholipid fatty acids and directly link groups of the microbial community (individual PLFAs) with the utilization of young plantation and older forest carbon. Conversion from forest to agriculture significantly (P&lt;0.05) de creased nutrient availability in the soil, microbial biomass, ,B-glucosidase and sulfatase activity, and produced compositionally and functionally distinct mi crobial communities. Although changes in a functional diversity index (Biol og) did not correlate with changes in community composition (PLFA), chang es in the specific activity of the enzymes were significantly correlated with changes in community composition. We also determined that different groups within the microbial community use different carbon sources and that chang es in community composition co-occurred with changes in the pools of car bon utilized. We can link microbial community composition to carbon uti lization and degradation using '3C-PLFA and enzyme activities. WALKER, M.,' W GOULD2 and A.

Alaska's arctic region, the North Slope, has experienced abnormally high summer temperatures over the past two decades. We have been following changes to plant community composition over time under ambient conditions and under experimental warming and manipulation of winter snow regime and cover. Community change was documented with a point-quadrat tech nique and analyzed with a combination of ordination, t-tests, and Markovian analysis. Changes in natural communities subject to ambient conditions in clude an increase in canopy density and in cover of dominant shrubs and graminoids, and a corresponding decrease in certain nonvascular species. Experimentally warmed communities show similar, but more dramatic pat terns. WALLACE, L. University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA. Root and/or shoot competition: Critical mechanisms for survival in a grazed environment. Six grass species were grown in competition arenas in the field in either Yellowstone Park or in the tallgrass prairie of the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma. Following harvest and chemical analyses, three compe tition indices were calculated based upon a) aboveground space captured, b) belowground resource captured or c) total biomass. Those species which were most tolerant of herbivory as shown by their ability to compensate (total biomass of grazed vs. ungrazed individuals) were shown to be superior root competitors. Those species that were less tolerant tended to utilize shoot competition more. Those arenas which were dominated by root competitors showed a typical herbivory response curve whereas those which were dom inated by shoot competitors did not show any herbivore maximization of production.

Effects of changes in land-use/land-cover and moisture levels on connectivity: Modeling characteristic habitat scales from the perspective of the or ganism. The goal of the research was to examine how the operational spatial scale of an organism interacts with the spatial scales at which disturbances (i.e., land use/land cover and climate change) occur in their impact on dispersal success. A spatially-explicit landscape model, incorporating land cover, to Oral Presentation Abstracts 225</page><page sequence="187">pography, and general moisture level, was combined with an individual-based movement model to simulate dispersal of amphibian species to breeding pond habitats. The simulated landscapes were patterned after land cover and to pographic gradients characteristic of the mid-Appalachian region. Behavior of the simulated species was parameterized after life history attributes of the red-spotted newt, Notophthalmus viridescens, and the green frog, Rana clam itans; characteristics that differed between the two included maximum dis persal distance and sensitivity to sub-optimal environmental conditions (frog newt for both traits). Successful dispersal from forest patches to new ponds was measured as a function of the grain size (fine- to coarse-grained) at which changes to the landscape-i.e., shifts to increasing agriculture and suburban development, and topographically dependent decreases in moisture levels across the landscape-occurred, as well as the traits of the dispersing organisms. Success of long-range dispersers was more strongly impacted by coarse-grained changes to the landscape than by finer levels of landscape change; short-range dispersers are more strongly impacted by the latter. The organism's level of sensitivity to sub-optimal habitat conditions interacted proportionately with the scale of landscape change in decreasing dispersal success. The non-linear relationships between scales of change in landscape characteristics, the species' traits, and dispersal success reveal the operational scales of the modeled organism: that is, they provide a measure of critical thresholds in effects of landscape pattern on the organism's behavior. Such understanding is crucial in predicting the effects of landscape change on persistence of populations of a given species. WALTHO, N.,' A. P CLEVENGER,2 K. GUNSON3 and B.

Factors affecting the permeability of wildlife passages in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Mitigation passages such as wildlife overpasses and underpasses have been designed to perforate road barriers and maintain horizontal natural processes across the landscape. Nonetheless, few studies attest the efficacy of these structures and of those studies all were limited to single species analyses. No study considers the effectiveness of wildlife overpasses and underpasses at multi-species scales equitable to the large mammal community or as a func tion of time in operation. Species performance ratios (i.e., observed crossing frequency / expected crossing frequency) were evaluated for four large car nivore and two ungulate species to mitigation structures in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Observed crossing frequencies were collected from year-round passage monitoring. Expected frequencies were developed from independent models based on data from radiotelemetry, pellet counts, and habitat suitability indices. A null model was tested to determine whether wildlife crossing structures serve species equally, or whether such structures limit habitat connectivity across roads in species-specific ways. In a two tiered analysis, we first modeled species responses to 15 variables associated with 11, 12-year old structures. Variables encompassed mitigation structure, landscape features, and human activity attributes. In the second tier, we con ducted a broader scale analysis that included an additional 12, 2-year old structures. The null model showed that species responded to structures dif ferently. The first analysis showed that at the older structures, levels of human activity consistently ranked high as a significant factor affecting crossings for individual species, species groups, and large mammal community. Car nivores avoided structures close to town or with high levels of human activity and preferred structures close to major drainages. For ungulates the structural attributes were more important than human ones. When the newer structures were included in the analysis the time in operation was the strongest factor determining passage and was positively correlated. Our results suggest that individuals require time to adapt to mitigation structures and only once this has occurred, evaluations can be carried out to identify the factors influencing passage rates.

Does light constrain seedling defense responses to herbivory? While plants commnonly respond to high light intensities with enhanced levels of chemical defenses, we do not know if low light in the shaded understory constrains the intensity of chemical defense responses to herbivory. We con ducted a field experiment in a mixed-temperate forest in central Pennsylvania to test two hypotheses: A. Light gaps promote accumulation of chemical defenses and B. Chemical defense responses to simulated herbivory are con strained by light. We treated gap and shaded seedlings of two tree species, chestnut oak (Quercus prinus) and red maple (Acer rubrum), with jasmonic acid and mechanical damage three times during one week to simulate her bivory. After one week, we harvested leaves from each species and measured levels of shikimate-based chemical defenses. Basal levels of total phenolics, condensed tannins, and hydrolyzable tannins in both species were higher in leaves from gap seedlings exposed to high light conditions, but responses to simulated herbivory were species-specific. Chestnut oak seedlings responded to simulated herbivory with enhanced levels of condensed tannins in gaps but not shaded sites, while red maple responded with higher levels of hy drolyzable tannins in the shaded sites but not in gaps. Seedling responses could have been conditioned by differences in light quality as well as light quantity. We documented significantly higher ratios of red to far red light in gaps compared to shaded sites. Current literature indicates that ratios of red to far red light regulate portions of tannin biosynthetic pathways in plants. We propose a model predicting induced tannin synthesis in microenviron ments differing in light quality and quantity. WARD, J. K.,1 T. E. DAWSON,2 D. L. PEERCE' and J. R.

Gender-specific responses of boxelder to water availability during a decade of growth in a common garden. Understanding the effects of water availability on the population structure of riparian trees is critical for predicting the impact of climate change on riparian systems. Dioecious boxelder (Acer negundo) is a common riparian species that we are using as a sensitive indicator of water stress among riparian trees. From earlier studies,we know that the genders of boxelder respond differently to water availability in the field, where males were more conservative in their water use than females. We now extend earlier studies to include stable carbon isotope ratio analyses of alpha-cellulose and the widths of individual tree rings for male and female trees throughout a decade of growth in a common garden. Stable carbon isotope analyses that are currently being con ducted will indicate whether or not the genders exhibit differential stomatal control over water loss during a major portion of their life cycle. In terms of growth, it was found that the width of tree rings was highly affected by year, but there were no significant differences between the tree ring widths of male and female trees, nor was there a significant year by gender inter action. This result indicates that throughout variable years of water avail ability, male and female boxelder exhibit similar growth responses despite possible differences in physiological responses to water availability.

Lessons learned in applying a satellite-driven model (3-PGS) to map forest growth capacity across southwestern Oregon Across a 54,000 km2 area in southwestern Oregon we mapped forest growth capacity using a process model (3-PGS) at 1 km2 resolution. Model predic tions of growth capacity closely matched those measured (r2 =0.8) where reliable data on soil fertility and soil water storage capacity were available. Across the region, however, we found broad scale soil maps were inadequate to provide good estimates of fertility. As a result, no benefits were gained in estimating light interception by vegetation with satellite sensors at finer res olutions than 1 km2. On the other hand, finer resolution sensors (such as Landsat Thematic Mapper) permitted discrimination and mapping of 14 ma jor forest types, for which model estimates of growth potential closely agreed with those measured (r2= 0.85) with similar standard errors as those recorded at more than 700 surveyed sites by Federal agencies. Mean monthly spatial coverages of temperature extremes and precipitation linked to digital eleva tion models proved adequate for extrapolation and conversion into solar ra diation, vapor -pressure deficits, and frost frequency at 200 m resolution. Remotely sensed estimates of canopy nitrogen concentrations (or chlorophyll) would be most beneficial in improving spatial estimates of forest growth capacity with this and related process models. 226 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="188">WARNER, K.

Ecological restoration and GIS: Curriculum for the Montana Natural History Center Loss of habitat and the invasion of non-native species have led to a decline in native flora in Montana. Many studies indicate that increased awareness of local natural ecosystems and native species develops appreciation and interest in conservation in residents. I developed an educational program in order to integrate plant biology and restoration ecology into the classroom, using geographical information systems (GIS) to promote awareness of local environments. In the summer of 1999, I collected baseline data describing the upper-canopy vegetation on Sleven's Island, Missoula, MT and input this information into ArcView 3.1. Using ArcView 3.1, vegetation coverages were created and overlaid onto a georeferenced aerial photograph of Sleven's Island. Local plant species were collected, pressed, and identified by 87 stu dents in grades 2-7 from the Missoula area. Six hundred and eleven speci mens of over 115 species were collected. The specimens were organized into voucher collections and an educational display for the Montana Natural His tory Center. Curriculum utilizing GIS was created and implemented through the University of Montana where elementary and high school students in vestigated invasive plant populations on Sleven's Island. They were asked to make management recommendations to restore the area to a natural state. Pre- and post-assessment of attitudes indicates that the curriculum has been successful in increasing awareness of invasive plants and fostering a more positive attitude about native species and plants in general. WARREN, P. University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA. Pat terns of song variation in different seasons in the bronzed cowbird support different evolutionary hypotheses. Many species of migratory birds continue to sing after the breeding season is over and even on their wintering grounds. Little is known about the function of song during the non-breeding season, but some species have been known to respond to playbacks of songs heard in the winter. However, no systematic study of variation in responses to different wintering songs has been conducted. I studied large scale patterns of song variation in the Bronzed Cowbird (Molothrus aeneus). I discovered differing patterns of song dialect variation in the breeding season versus the wintering season. These differing patterns also support different hypotheses for the origin and evolution of song dialects. I also tested the responses of breeding male Bronzed Cowbirds to four song dialects recorded on wintering grounds in the Mexico and the United States. The birds appeared to respond most strongly to a song dialect which might only be heard on their wintering grounds. Despite its status as an invasive brood parasite, few studies have examined the behavior of the Bronzed Cowbird. The wintering behavior of this species suggests possibilities for controlling this potentially destruc tive species. WASER, N. M., M. V. PRICE, A. K. BRODY and D. R. CAMPBELL. Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Crested Butte, CO, U. S. A. Pol lination success and plant population size: How strong are the links? Pollination services to a given plant species are far from constant. For example, 4 summers of observation at 3 permanent sites in the Rocky Mountains separated by 200-400 m from each other indicates more than a 3-fold range in the rate of visitation to flowers of Ipomopsis aggregata (scarlet gilia), and occasional shifts from hummingbirds to bumblebees as major pollinators. Spatial and temporal variation in pollination does directly translate into seed set in these populations, but density-dependent seedling germination or growth of juveniles might subsequently dampen the signal of variable fecundity before the next generation of adults is reached. This link between fecundity and performance of the subsequent generation has rarely been explored. To explore it experimentally, we seeded 6 replicate 8 m2 plots with 750 seeds, and 6 with 1500 seeds, representing average vs. full pollination. A second, single set of plots was seeded with a much wider range of 300-3000 seeds. Over both experiments we planted 22,500 seeds. In neither experiment was there detectable density-dependence in seedling emergence, which averaged ca. 6.5% in the 750- and 1500-seed plots and ca. 10% in the 300-3000 seed plots. Survival to age 1 yr averaged 39% in 750-seed plots vs. 35% in 1500-seed plots, again not significantly different. These results do not exclude the possibility of later density-dependence, which our continued censuses of all individually-mapped experimental in dividuals should detect. Empirical evidence for density-dependence, or lack thereof, in the transition from pollination and seed production to the next generation of juveniles and adults will be of interest for "pure" questions in plant population dynamics and phenotypic selection analysis, and for the management of endangered plant populations.

How does a sagebrush steppe landscape's composition and pattern respond to grazing, fire, and climate change? Simulated landscapes, which contained small proportions of shrubs relative to higher equal proportions of grass and baresoil, were subjected to both high drought frequency and grazing and low drought frequency and high grazing disturbance regimes. Faster canopy cover convergence to shrub dominance, grass cover extinction, and increased clumping of shrub patches occurred in the landscapes treated by high drought frequency and high grazing regimes. We wondered: Do real landscapes, which are subject to grazing, fire, and climate change, respond in a similar manner? We tested these hypotheses on a sagebrush steppe landscape which was subject to mixed-commercial grazing (livestock and wildlife), fire, and, drought. We hypothesized that both shrub and bare soil cover would be greater relative to grass with a decrease in grass cover, high clumping of shrub, and high interspersion of grass. We generated a timeseries (1972 to 1997) of plant growth form and land cover images, i.e., shrub, grass, and baresoil, from 22 dry season Landsat satellite images. We found 1) shrub cover became greater than grass cover in 1974 with a corresponding decrease in grass cover; 2) shrub patches became more clumped, but patches were smaller in size and thus more fragmented; 3) from 1972 to 1997 grass patches were highly dispersed, became smaller in size, but number of patches remained constant, and 4) baresoil became fragmented, where cover did not change, mean patch size became smaller and increased in number. Increase in the number of cattle grazing the landscape over time appears to be the primary driver behind these changes rather than climate change. WATKINSON, A. and R. FRECKLETON. University of East Anglia, Nor wich, UK. Predicting the impacts of harvesting using structured pop ulation models: An example based on tropical trees. Structured population models are often used to predict the long-term be haviour of populations of economic or conservation interest. Such models, however, rarely include density-dependence and are typically parameterised with respect to fixed census points within the life cycle. We analyse a model for the harvesting of adults of the edible palm Euterpe edulis in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil for which the role of density-dependence has been clearly defined. Harvesting adult plants for the 'heart of palm' or palmito leads to the death of plants and consequently has a major impact on population structure and abundance. Size structures are typically linear or slightly L shaped in harvested populations, contrasting with the reverse J shape that is characteristic of unexploited populations. It is shown, if density-depen dence is not included, that predictions of population responses to harvesting are erroneous and highly misleading. Moreover we show that the timing as well as the intensity of harvesting are important in determining popu lation behaviour. In particular, it is shown that population growth rates may lie within a range of values for a given level of harvesting, depending on how the timing of mortality relates to the structure of the model. Our analyses suggest that the essentially static nature of most existing analyses of the impacts of harvesting on populations can lead to misleading or un informative predictions on the impacts of harvesting on abundance and the levels of harvesting that can be sustained.

Juniperus ashei seedlings play an important role in the regeneration of Jun iperus woodlands and recruitment into grasslands. Seedlings occur under the Oral Presentation Abstracts 227</page><page sequence="189">canopy and at the canopy edge. Associated with these seedlings is a xeric sedge, Carex lanostachys, occurring at both positions. Until recently, no stud ies have been conducted on J. ashei seedlings or associated species. To gain an understanding of the effect of temporal changes in soil moisture on plant water relations, bedrock soil moisture and predawn xylem water potential (PSIp) were measured monthly during 1997 under the Juniperus woodland canopy and at the canopy edge. Soil moisture (%) varied temporally at each position (ANOVA, F = 14.18 and F = 33.44, all P-values &lt; 0.0001), but within any month there were no significant differences between the canopy and canopy edge positions. Mean soil moisture in May was 60.02 ? 2.23% (?SE) under the canopy (C) and 44.69 ? 1.34% at the canopy edge (CE), in August 22.81 ? 1.12% (C) and 21.91 ? 0.61% (CE), and in December 57.82 ? 6.69% (C) and 44.66 ? 1.74% (CE). Juniperus ashei seedling PSIP varied during the study under the woodland canopy and at the canopy edge (F = 1452.62 and F = 633.61, all P-values &lt; 0.0001). The PSI for canopy seedlings ranged from -0.48 + 0.01 MPa in May to -6.5 + 0 MPa in August. Seedling PSI, at the canopy edge ranged from -0.76 ? 0.05 MPa in May to -6.5 ? 0 MPa in August. In December, canopy seedlings were -0.36 + 0.03 MPa and canopy edge seedlings were -0.33 MPa. Carex planostachys PSI, also varied during the study under the canopy and at the canopy edge (F = 1379.71 and F = 14004.62, all P-values 0.0001). The PSI for canopy sedge ranged from -0.01 ? 0 MPa in May to -6.5 ? 0 MPa in August. Canopy edge sedge ranged from -0.4 + 0.03 MPa in May to -6.5 + 0 MPa in August. In December, canopy sedge and canopy edge sedge were both 0.01 ? 0 MPa. During wet months, C. planostachys has less water stress than J. ashei seedlings, but during summer drought no differences are detected. Predawn PSI of both species decrease in response to declining soil moisture, and increase with soil rehydration. Additionally, the PSI, of J. ashei and C. plan ostachys appear to have similar trends in their response to available soil moisture. WEBB, C. 0.' and D. R.

Dispersal limitation has been proposed as a mechanism for the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical rain forest. Localized seed dispersal, and therefore low species mixing, should slow local competitive exclusion, be cause in some neighborhoods poor competitors will avoid superior compet itors. Due to the difficulty of observing seed dispersal, however, there has to date been little evidence to test this hypothesis. By comparing the species lists of 28 fully-inventoried tree plots (0.16 ha) with those of nested seedling plots (36 m2), in rain forest at Gunung Palung (Indonesian Borneo), we estimate that, on average, 67.8% (SE = 1.4%) of the seedling species, and 40.2% (SE = 3.6%) of seedlings in seedling plots were from actively dis persed seeds. We used reproductive phenology data, and estimates of seed shadows for undispersed seed, to determine which trees in the tree plots could have dropped undispersed seed into the seedling plots; all other species must have been actively dispersed from outside. Total seedling species richness in a plot was strongly correlated (r2 = 0.945, P &lt; 0.0001) with the number of actively dispersed species, and unrelated to the species diversity of the tree plot containing it (r2 = 0.002, P &gt; 0.05). Thus, local seedling species rich ness is not limited by the local richness of adults, suggesting that mechanisms other than dispersal limitation may be vital for the maintenance of species diversity in this forest. The high level of seed dispersal in this forest with an intact vertebrate community, combined with the high proportion of tree spe cies (84%) with endozoochorous fruits, raises concerns about the fate of many tree species when animal dispersers are lost.

Regeneration of slash-and-burn agricultural fields in rela tion to landscape structure in the Orange Walk District, Belize. Due to demographic and economic pressures, the predominantly forested matrix that historically characterized many areas of slash-and-burn agriculture is being replaced by a matrix of younger forests at various stages of recovery. The more rapid turnover of plots and the altered spatial context of the fields and forests within the landscape may have ramifications for the long-term fate of tropical forests. For example, it could be hypothesized that the adja cency and diversity of seed sources for regeneration on fallow fields has been altered as a result of the changes in landscape structure, and this altered spatial context may subsequently influence the rate and trajectory of succes sion. We examined this hypothesis by collecting vegetation data from thirty two milpas (slash-and-bum fields) that varied in their age (fallow &gt; 3 years, fallow &lt; 3 years, in use &gt;3 years, in use &lt; 3 years) and their distance to older forest (&gt; 100 m or &lt; 100 m). Species composition for both the woody and herbaceous strata were found to be significantly different between near and distant milpas. Further, Shannon's diversity index values for woody veg etation were greater in the milpas near old growth than distant milpas cur rently in use. One implication that could be drawn from these results is that regenerating fields marked by lower diversity may be less resilient and re cover more slowly from cultivation because of greater soil leaching brought about by the less efficient uptake and cycling of soil resources (e.g., nitrogen). WEEKS, J. A. University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721. The role of ant nutrition in mediating a lycaenid-ant mutualism. Variability in the occurrence, strength, or outcome of mutualistic interactions has the potential to mediate both ecological and evolutionary processes with in and among species. In this study, I examined the role of ant nutrition in mediating the context-dependent variability that occurs in the facultative mu tualism between the lycaenid butterfly, Hemiargus isola, and one species of attendant ants, Crematogaster opuntiae. To establish that the response of foraging ants to lycaenid caterpillars is based on the nutritional needs of the colony, I quantified the response of foraging ants from colonies fed a high carbohydrate/low protein diet, a high protein/low carbohydrate diet, and a balanced carbohydrate and protein control diet to lycaenid caterpillars. Diet had a significant impact on the motivation of foraging ants to tend lycaenids. Significantly more ants from colonies fed a high protein/low carbohydrate diet tended lycaenids indicating that workers do forage based on the nutri tional needs of the colony. Because the availability of carbohydrate resources changes dramatically during the months when several generations of lycaen ids are completing development, these results suggest that there is a seasonal preference for H. isola that has the potential to impact population dynamics. In addition, the results indicate that there is variability in larval attractiveness. The response of foraging ants from a single colony to individual larvae differed significantly. Therefore, it appears that, in addition to ant nutrition, other factors influencing larval attractiveness contribute to the variability ob served in this mutualism. WEINER, J., H. GRIEPENTROG and L. KRISTENSEN. Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Frederiksberg, Denmark. Increasing the sup pression of weeds by cereal crops. Recent advances in our understanding of the size-advantage in competition among individual plants suggest that the potential for many crops to suppress weeds is much greater than generally appreciated, and that this potential can be realized if (a) the crop density is increased significantly, and (b) the crop is hyperdispersed (uniformly distributed) in two-dimensional space rather than sown in traditional rows. We tested this hypotheses by sowing four varieties of spring wheat at three densities (200, 400 and 600 m-2) and in two spatial patterns (normal rows and a hyperdispersed grid pattern) in the presence of high weed pressure. There were strong and significant effects of both crop density and spatial distribution on weed growth and resultant yield losses. Weed biomass was 30% lower in the uniform pattern. The treatment with high crop density and a uniform sowing pattern contained 60% less weed biomass and produced 60% higher yield than the treatment reflecting normal sowing practices (crops sown in rows at 400 m-2). The results were similar when the experiment was repeated in the following year, even though the weed community was very different. A more crowded, uniforn distri bution of many crops can contribute to a strategy to reduce the use of her bicides and energy-intensive forms of weed control. WEINIG, C. and J. SCHMITT. Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA. Responses to ambient UV radiation and R:FR vary between sun and shade populations of Impatiens capensis. Exposure to ultra-violet radiation (UV) affects many aspects of plant devel opment, including plant architecture and the production of leaf secondary compounds (anthocyanins and flavonoids). We examined 1) the phenotypic and fitness effects of UV, 2) the combined effects of UV and the ratio of 228 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="190">red:far-red light (R:FR), and 3) the relative responses of Impatiens capensis populations derived from woodland and clearing sites to UV. Seedlings from each population were exposed to either high R:FR typical of sunlight or low R:FR characteristic of foliar shade, after which plants were moved into am bient UV or UV-removal treatments. Preliminary analyses indicate that the negative effects of UV exposure on reproductive output were greater in plants initially experiencing low relative to high R:FR. These results suggest a cost to stem elongation in terms of subsequent susceptibility to UV damage. UV stimulated the production of both anthocyanins and flavonoids. However, higher anthocyanin concentrations were correlated with lower fitness in clear ing population. Relative to the clearing population, the fitness of the wood land population was more detrimentally affected by exposure to UV, despite its greater increases in anthocyanin production under UV conditions. In creased anthocyanin production under UV may therefore be a stress response rather than an adaptive one. The greater tolerance of the clearing population to UV suggests that populations with an evolutionary history of UV exposure evolve mechanisms to limit damage. WEINTRAUB, M. N. and J. P. SCHIMEL. University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA. Dynamics of biologically available C and N in tundra communities. We characterized biologically available C and N in tundra soils by using long-term incubations, 14C and 15N isotope equilibration, and chemical frac tionation. In tussock tundra soils, we found very little decline in respiration rate over 1 year, though soils respired almost 10% of the total C. This sug gested that respiration was dominated by a large pool of potentially available substrate, rather than an 'active' fraction. In shrub soils there was a significant decline in respiration rates, indicating the presence of a smaller active C pool. To determine the nature of respired C, we used 14C isotope equilibration, in which microbial biomass was labeled by adding 14C glucose, and the isotope was equilibrated into the microbial biomass and products (MB&amp;P) pool. By assaying the enrichment of both microbial biomass and CO2, the size of the MB&amp;P pool and proportion of respired C from MB&amp;P can be estimated. In tussock, intertussock, and shrub soil, MB&amp;P supplied 11%, 19%, 23% of the CO2. In the wet meadow soil, MB&amp;P supplied 26% of the CO2 at the surface (0-5 cm), but only 6% 15-25 cm below the surface. MB&amp;P represented 3% of soil C for tussock, 4% for inter-tussock, and 7% for shrub soil. In the wet meadow soil, MB&amp;P comprised 5% of soil C at the surface, and 2% of the soil C in the horizons below. We have also fractionated the soils using a peat fractionation scheme. The best predictors of respiration were cellulose and lignin rather than soluble fractions. Thus, detritus chemistry was an important control on microbial activity, but eco system based differences were still more important: a straight correlation of respiration vs. ligno-cellulose index had an R2 of 0.002. WELLBORN, G. A. University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, U.S.A. Tradeoff between competitive ability and antipredator adaptation in a freshwater amphipod species complex. Because body size influences many physiological and ecological processes, tradeoffs associated with adaptive change in body size will produce manifold effects for individuals. Within the Hyalella azteca (Crustacea: Amphipoda) species complex, there is a striking pattern of diversification in body size, with large-bodied species occurring in fishless habitats and small-bodied spe cies occurring in habitats with centrarchid fish. This divergence in body size appears to be driven by adaptation to the disparate regimes of size-biased mortality experienced in the two habitat types. I explored some consequences of this predation-mediated adaptation in body size by asking how size and size-related traits influepce competitive ability of the large and small species. I examined competitive ability in large and small Hyalella species by con ducting a factorial experiment in which the performance of each amphipod species was assessed in all combinations of the presence and absence of the heterospecific amphipod species crossed with the presence and absence of a pulmonate snail, Physella virgata. Results of this study indicate that the large and small Hyalella species differ substantially in competitive ability, with the large species being the superior general competitor. The competitive im pact of the large species on the small species was substantial and caused significant reductions in abundance, body size, and fecundity of the small species. For example, relative to the treatment in which the small species was alone, the presence of the large species caused a 7-fold reduction in the final abundance and a 25-fold reduction in fecundity of the small species. In contrast, performance of the large species was not significantly affected by presence of the small species. This competitive asymmetry was also seen in competitive interactions with snails. For example, snail density was signifi cantly lower in the presence of the large Hyalella species than in the presence of the small species. The large and small Hyalella species also differed sig nificantly in two size-dependent traits, foraging rate and activity level, and these trait differences may form the mechanistic basis of the competitive asymmetry between the species.

Context dependent species interactions and community organization: Incorporating environmental variation into ecological ex periments. Species interactions in nature are subject to the influences of local envi ronmental conditions that can alter their strength and outcomes. Such "con text dependent" interactions are important for organizing communities be cause they shape the functional roles that species play. Contemporary eco logical experiments, however, often fail to incorporate environmental var iation into their designs, i.e., when they are conducted at some discrete point along an environmental gradient rather than at multiple points across its breadth. As a result, they provide a limited understanding of how species roles may shift in naturally heterogeneous settings. Here we present ex amples of how algal-grazer and grazer-grazer interactions in mountain streams are shaped by two important environmental contexts: Light inten sity and current velocity. In an experiment examining light, we found graz ers caused significantly greater depletions in algal biomass (P &lt; 0.01) as light intensity increased. In addition, some algal species responded in a dramatically different manner to grazing as light levels changed. Hydrurus foetidus (Chrysophyta), for example, increased in abundance when grazed in full sunlight, but decreased when grazed in 40% shade. In separate ex periments, we examined how the independent and interactive effects of two insect grazers, Glossosoma (Trichoptera) and Drunella (Ephemeroptera), foraging on periphytic algae varied under 3 current velocities (5, 15 and 35 cm/s). Current velocity had a profound influence on the grazer-grazer interaction, mediating a positive relationship that occurred between Glos sosoma growth rate and Drunella density (i.e., facilitation, P &lt; 0.001). Facilitation occurred primarily at slow current, was weak at medium cur rent, and was non-significant at fast current. Taken together, these results indicate that herbivory and herbivore interactions can vary dynamically in streams depending on local environmental conditions. Further, these results suggest that important ecological issues, such as the extent of functional redundancy among species or the mechanisms of species coexistence in natural communities, cannot be adequately understood without explicit in corporation of environmental heterogeneity into field experiments.

Insecticide treatment increases fine root longevity in peach (Prunus persica). The effects of aboveground insect herbivory on plant performance in both natural and agricultural systems are well documented. However, our under standing of belowground herbivory is much more limited. A number of au thors working with rhizotrons and minirhizotrons have noted insects feeding on and around roots, but the consequences of these interactions for root life history have rarely been examined in detail. In the present experiment, we used nondestructive belowground imaging technology to assess the effects of soil insect suppression on the production and longevity of peach (Prunus persica) fine roots (&lt; 1 mm diameter) over the course of two growing seasons. The experiment was conducted at the USDA-ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Station in Kearneysville, WV using six 15-yr.-old peach trees. Two clear butyrate observation tubes (minirhizotrons) were installed beneath each tree at an angle of 300 from the vertical in April 1996. Soil drench treatments were applied around individual minirhizotron tubes at monthly intervals and consisted of 1L of water (control) or 250 microliters of the broad-spectrum insecticide chlorpyrifos in 1 L of water. Roots which grew against the surface of the minirhizotron tubes were videotaped at two- to four-week intervals during the 1996-97 and 1997-98 growing seasons. The Oral Presentation Abstracts 229</page><page sequence="191">effect of insecticide treatment on the risk of root mortality in each year was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression performed with SAS PROC PHREG. The application of broad-spectrum insecticide was associated with a significant increase in fine root longevity. Median lifespans were 46 to 125 days longer for roots on insecticide-treated tubes compared with roots from control tubes. In addition, the development of brown pigmentation was significantly delayed in roots which were treated with insecticide. The effects of insecticide application did not appear to be due to increased soil fertility, as accumulation of NO3-, NH4+, and PO42- on mixed bed ion-exchange resin was similar in treated and untreated soil. The results presented here indicate that interactions with belowground insects can significantly influence root longevity and may alter the rate at which roots undergo developmental changes in anatomy and physiology.

Population consequences of intermediate disturbance: Recruitment, browsing, predation, and geochemistry. Biogenic disturbance is a dominant feature of marine soft-sediments, af fecting both sediment chemistry and infaunal abundances. Our goal was to address how predation, disturbance by infauna, and sediment chemistry interact to determine population structure and recruitment. Sediment dwell ers, for example, feed and defecate on the surface, thereby causing mor tality of larvae and juveniles. Browsing predation on adults can reduce disturbance imposed by adults because individuals feed and defecate less while they regenerate. While consuming adult body parts, browsers them selves disturb the sediments, resulting in changes in the surficial chemical properties, as well as ingestion of larvae. Previous studies suggest that changes in surficial sediment chemistry may result in changes in the ac ceptability of a site to larvae. Thus there is a potential balance between browsing predation, sediment disturbance, and larval recruitment in marine sedimentary habitats. We used a population model consisting of 4 coupled differential equations to examine the relationship between predation, dis turbance, sediment chemistry, and their interactive effects on the population dynamics of adults, recovering individuals and settlers. We parameterized the model using demographic and predation data on the clam Macoma balthica for the Wadden Sea. In the model Macoma shows enhanced re cruitment at intermediate browsing intensities in sediments from sands to muds. The enhancement of recruitment by browsing is a function of the ratio of the recovery rate to the browsing rate, and the ratio of the rate of disturbance by intact adults to the rate of consumption of larvae by brows ers. This phenomenon is a population-level analog of Connell's enhance ment of species diversity at intermediate disturbance rates, in that both the total population abundance and diversity of age classes is maximized at intermediate disturbance rates.

Host switching by phytophagous insects is thought to be the first step along a path to host-race formation and subsequent sympatric speciation. Thus, examining the factors that prevent and promote host switching may help us to understand the process of speciation. The goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta so lidaginis, has been shown to exist as two host races on the goldenrods Sol idago altissima and S. gigantea. We have found occasional galls on a third goldenrod species, S. canadensis, and flies have emerged from these galls. We wanted to know whether ability to induce galls on S. canadensis or aversion to oviposition on S. canadensis limited the use of this host plant in the field by flies from galls on S. gigantea. We conducted choice and no choice oviposition experiments in the greenhouse to test these possibilities. Oviposition on the two hosts was equivalent in the choice test. In addition, galls were induced on S. canadensis at a higher rate than on the normal host S. gigantea, although we don't expect survival to adulthood on S. canadensis to be higher. Thus, choice and ability to induce galls do not seem to be any barrier to the use of this new host. Preliminary data suggesting higher galling rates of S. canadensis relative to S. gigantea on younger plants than on older plants, and the elimination of other alternatives, lead us to the new hypothesis that the differential timing of plant susceptibility to galling may be preventing the use of an alternate host plant.

Relationship between con sumption and growth in selected fishes of the NW Atlantic: Insight from a long-term bottom-trawl database. An ecological simulation model of the fish community of selected regions of the NW Atlantic continental shelf system was developed to provide insight into the functioning of the fishery ecosystem under different fishery removal regimes. The model consists of sub-models that portray the pro cesses of consumption, growth, reproduction, migration, and fishery re movals. One of the main submodels describes a relationship between fish consumption and growth. We investigated the nature of an empirical rela tionship between food consumption and growth to provide a basis for a mathematical representation in the simulation model. The amount and se lection of food types consumed and the relationship of ingestion to growth must be addressed in the consumption-growth sub-model. These relation ships were derived by using NEFSC data. Growth increments for age co horts were calculated from length-at-age data. By utilizing the parameters of stomach content weight and bottom temperature data, a gastric evacu ation model calculated consumption for age categories. For fish are that are not routinely aged by NEFSC, ages were calculated by using von Ber talanffy growth equations. Preliminary results indicated a strong relation ship between consumption and growth for some species in the system, whereas the relationship was indeterminate for other fishes. We explored factors that might contribute to this pattern, including differential fishing removals, inter- and intra-specific competition (density dependence, depen sation), and changes in abiotic factors. These results suggest that food con sumption estimates derived from stomach contents data may be valuable in developing algorithmic relationships between fish food consumption and individual growth. Algorithms such as these furnish a valuable component in multispecies trophic dynamic models of fisheries ecosystems. WHITE, J. R., K. REDDY and I. CALZADA-BUJAK. University of Flor ida, Gainesville, Fl USA. Effects of drawdown on phosphorus dynamics of a subtropical wetland. Accretion of organic matter can constitute a major sink for phosphorus (P) in wetlands. Alternating flooded-drained conditions in organic soils have demonstrated increased soluble P floodwater concentrations in some wet lands. Phosphorus retention/release of newly accreted soils should be eval uated under various hydrologic conditions to guide management policy and to forecast the potential efficiency of treatment wetlands. We investigated the influence of hydrology on P release from soils of the Everglades Nu trient Removal Project (ENRP), a treatment wetland designed to reduce P levels in agricultural drainage waters flowing into the Everglades. Intact soil cores were collected, 9 each at inflow, interior, and outflow stations. A 20 cm floodwater depth was aerated and replaced every 30 days to simulate the wetland's hydraulic retention time. Treatments investigated were: 90 days continuous flooding, 30 days drawdown-drying, and 30 days drawdown followed by 90 days flooding. Soluble reactive P and soluble total P concentrations were measured in the floodwater over time as well as changes in the microbial pool and activity. Highest P flux occurred under continuous flooding at the inflow, decreasing towards the outflow. P flux decreased significantly upon drawdown-reflooding suggesting this manage ment strategy increased P retention in these soils. Consequently, imple menting a short-term drawdown may be a beneficial management tool for the ENRP resulting in both soil consolidation and P flux reduction from recently accreted organic soils.

Associational susceptibility of cottonwood to a box elder herbivore. Associational resistance, which refers to decreased herbivory experienced by a plant growing with heterospecific neighbors, is a well documented ecological phenomenon. In contrast, studies that describe increased herbiv ory due to heterospecific neighbors (associational susceptibility) are rela tively rare. In this study we document associational susceptibility among hosts of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria). Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia X P. fremontii) located under box elder (Acer negundo) were 230 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="192">colonized by 2-3 times more cankerworms, and suffered 2-3 times greater defoliation than cottonwoods growing under mature cottonwoods, or cot tonwoods growing in the open. This associational pattern reflects fall can kerworm's strong preference for box elder over cottonwood: Egg densities were 26 times greater on box elder than cottonwood, first instar larvae consumed 75 times more box elder than cottonwood in larval palatability trials, and fourth instar larvae consumed 3 times more box elder than cot tonwood. In terms of larval performance, first instar larvae exhibited ap proximately 6 times greater mortality and 40% slower development time on cottonwood relative to box elder, whereas fourth instar larval perfor mance did not differ between the hosts. Based on these and other findings, we predict that when generalist herbivores reach outbreak proportions and consume their preferred hosts, they will then move to nearby less-preferred hosts to complete their life cycle. This "spill over" effect will result in associational susceptibility for less-preferred hosts and is likely common in forest outbreak situations where herbivore densities are high. WHITHAM, T.

Plant ontogeny affects community structure and biodiversity. Studies of Populus and Eucalyptus in the wild and synthetic populations in common gardens show that the distributions of diverse arthropod and fungal taxa, species richness, and abundance have a strong ontogenetic component (a shift in gene expression with plant age). Using NMDS (non metric multidimensional scaling) we found that genetic variation in phase shifting from juvenile to mature foliage types affected most arthropods and fungi. Genetic variation in plants affects community structure directly through changing host quality or indirectly through keystone species. The underlying genetic variation in the plant population has important com munity-level consequences that rival the importance of competition, pre dation, and edaphic factors in structuring communities.

Native spe cies response to invasion: Effects of green crabs on soft-shell clam be havior and morphology. Invasive predators may decimate native populations because the natives evolved in a community without similar predators and lack specific adapta tions for effective predator avoidance. To prevent the loss of native species, we must determine whether natives have the potential to respond effectively to invasive predators. We can then manage invaded areas by promoting con ditions that favor effective native responses. In Maine, predation by invasive green crabs, Carcinus maenas, is a factor in the decline of native soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria. If clams behaviorally respond to the invasive crab by digging deeper, this may reduce vulnerability. However, siphon length limits clam depth in the sediment because a stretched siphon has a smaller diameter, decreasing food and oxygen intake rates. Hence, clams face a trade-off be tween decreased predation and decreased feeding rates at greater depths in the sediment. If clams can morphologically respond to predator cues by al locating energy to siphon growth, this would overcome the reduction in feed ing rates deeper in the sediment. We tested the hypothesis that clams change both behavior and morphology in response to invasive crab foraging to bal ance the trade-off between predator avoidance and feeding rate. Laboratory and field experiments tested how clams responded to either chemical cues from crabs or crab foraging activity. In the laboratory, we exposed juvenile clams to crab odor or normal seawater. In the field, we built crab exclosure, enclosure, and control plots containing either juvenile or adult clams. We measured depth in the sediment, shell length, width, thickness, weight, tissue weight, and siphon length for all clams. In the laboratory, juvenile clams exposed to crab odor buried deeper, but showed no difference in siphon growth or shell growth. In the field, clams in crab enclosure and control plots were deeper, but showed no difference in siphon growth or shell growth. Overall, results indicate native clams can respond to invasive crabs by dig ging deeper in the sediment to avoid predation. However, lack of increases in siphon growth indicates decreased feeding rates may also be responsible for clam population declines. WHITMAN, K. J. and J. F SCHALLES. Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178 USA. The optics, pigments and phenology of water lily leaves. Recently, hyperspectral measurements have been used to relate leaf optics and pigment concentrations in higher plants. Our study investigated the optical and pigment relationships in aquatic vegetation. Water lilies may dominate wetland and lentic littoral communities and strongly effect the radiant and geochemical processes. We grew tropical and northern water lily plants in greenhouse tanks and measured leaf phenology and turnover, spectral reflectance and transmission, and pigment content. As the leaves matured, they underwent significant color changes from a red-green or light green early phase to a dark green mature phase and then senesced to yellow. We were able to measure these orderly changes in the leaf optics as the leaf aged. VIS reflectance increased and the "red edge" transition decreased sharply during later stages. Chlorophyll a content varied from 1 mg / cm 2 in yellow senescent leaves to 10-20 mg / cm-2 in young leaves to 25-45 mg I cm-2 in mature leaves. Recent NIR chlorophyll retrieval algorithms (ratio of reflectances at 750 over 700nm and 750 over 550nm) by Gitelson and Merzlyak (1997) accurately related light reflectance to pigment content in our leaves. Further analysis of the reflectance spectra showed a corre lation between the red region (Rred) and anthocyanin content. For compar ison, measurements were taken from naturally growing specimens in the family Nymphaeaceae. Nuphar lutea subspecies orbiculata were sampled from the St. Mary's River and Nymphaea odorata were collected from the Okefenokee Swamp, both in Southern Georgia. At Lake Manawa, Iowa, we took measurements from American lotus plants, Nelumbo lutea. Com pared to the greenhouse plants grown under controlled conditions, the nat urally growing plants have shown differences in leaf pigments and thick ness, and natural variations to seasonal light and temperature regimes. This study provides a small-scale experimental model that can lead to canopy and habitat studies of wetland communities. WIEGAND, K.,12 D. WARD2 and D.

Bush encroachment as an integral part of sa vanna dynamics. For many years, the coexistence of woody and grassy plants in savannas has been attributed to a rooting niche separation. It was assumed that water is the limiting resource for both growth forms and that grasses take their water from the upper soil layer and trees and bushes from the lower. How ever, field studies showed that such a niche separation is the exception rather than the rule among different savannas. Furthermore, with a spatially explicit simulation model it has been shown that even if the two-layer hypothesis were true, it would not be sufficient to allow coexistence under a range of climatic situations. Bush encroachment (i.e. the suppression of palatable grasses and herbs by encroaching woody species often unpalat able to domestic livestock) is a serious problem in many savannas because it threatens the living of many pastoralists. In the literature, the occurrence of bush encroachment is almost exclusively attributed to overgrazing. We tested the hypothesis that under certain (climatic) conditions bush encroach ment is part of a cyclic succession between-open savanna and woody dom inance driven by only two factors: Rainfall highly variable in space and time, and between-tree competition. In this case, savannas are patch dy namic systems, i.e. savanna landscapes are composed of many patches (a few hectares in size) in different states of transition between grassy and woody dominance. Taking a savanna in Namibia as an example, we ana lyzed local tree size distributions, grass production, and soil nutrient con centrations across the savanna. Furthermore, we analyzed the results of removal experiments testing for the effect of competition on tree growth and combine modelling and field observation to elucidate the effect of inter tree competition on tree mortality. All analyses clearly showed that the savanna under study is a patch dynamic system as described above. WIENK, C. L.,1 C. H. SIEG2 and G. R.

Prescribed burning and overstory reduction as tools for restoration of ponderosa pine forests. Disturbances such as fire have been absent from many forests for up to a century, with consequent impacts on ecosystem structure and function. In Oral Presentation Abstracts 231</page><page sequence="193">dense stands of Pinus ponderosa Laws. (ponderosa pine) in the Black Hills of South Dakota, understory vegetation has been replaced by a thick layer of pine needles. We experimentally addressed the main and interactive effects of prescribed burning (two levels) and overstory reduction (three levels) on understory vegetation. In addition, we examined the extent to which lack of a soil seed bank constrains understory recruitment in dense forests. Finally, stand history was examined by utilizing dendrochronological methods to de termine fire history and stand age, and by researching historical documents to determine land use history. Dendrochronological results indicate that the stand is approximately 100 years old and has not burned for at least 100 years. Response of understory vegetation during the first growing season after application of treatments was very sparse, with no significant differences between treatments. Only 24 individual plants (representing 10-14 species of herbaceous dicots and 1-2 grass species) emerged from 1080 pretreatment soil samples. Paucity of viable seeds in the soil seed bank may constrain recruitment of understory vegetation in dense, undisturbed coniferous forests, such as ponderosa pine forests of South Dakota.

We relate plant zonation in salt marshes to key ecosystem services such as erosion control and wildlife habitat. Ten salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, with similar geological bedrock and sea exchange, were identified to ex amine plant zonation. Sub-watersheds adjacent to the salt marshes were characterized by land use practices and stream nutrient concentrations. We use a space-for-time approach: gradients of low to high % residential land use and low to high nitrate concentrations in the headwater streams were measured for the salt marshes. In the Fall, there was a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05; r = +0.84) between total dissolved nitrogen and % residential land use among the ten sites. Ribbed mussel stable nitrogen isotopic sig natures reflected the nitrogen sources from the adjacent watersheds and were significantly correlated with % residential (p &lt; 0.05; r = +0.68). Because human wastewater is known to enrich stable nitrogen isotope ra tios in organisms, our results suggest that with increasing residential de velopment, the salt marshes are receiving increasing nitrogen loads asso ciated with human activities. Results from plant zonation transects in the salt marshes showed a significant correlation between the areal extent of Spartina patens and the total number of plant zones (p &lt; 0.05; r = +0.69). Furthermore, the transects revealed an inverse relationship between the areal extent of S. patens and % residential (p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.66). We propose that the low marsh species, Spartina alterniflora displaces S. pat ens when salt marshes are enriched with nitrogen, and we support this hypothesis with a significant inverse correlation between the areal extent of S. patens and S. alterniflora. In addition, the stable nitrogen isotopic ratio of the aboveground tissue of S. alterniflora was directly correlated with % residential (p &lt; 0.05; r = +0.73). Since the root structure of S. patens is better than S. alterniflora at promoting peat accumulation, we propose that salt marshes are more susceptible to erosional processes when enriched with nitrogen. Finally, the number of plant zones and areal extent of S. patens are good indicators of salt marsh condition. WILLIAMS, D. G.,' G. LIN2 and J.

Stable isotope composition of water vapor and CO2 of air in mesquite-C4 grass vegetation. Increases in C3 woody plant cover in former C4-dominated grasslands have significantly altered patterns of CO2 and water vapor exchanges with the atmosphere. How grass, soil, and woody plant components contribute to CO2 and water vapor fluxes as water availability during growth periods changes is unclear. We estimated the proportional contribution of these ecosystem components to water vapor and CO2 fluxes using stable isotope analyses. Stable isotope ratios and concentrations of water vapor and CO2 of air from different heights in the canopy were measured over 24-h cycles at two sites in southeastern Arizona during the annual 'monsoon' rainy period and post-monsoon drought. The 'savanna' site had an open overstory canopy of the woody C3 species mesquite (Prosopis velutina) and abundant cover of perennial C4 grass (Sporobolus wrightii) in the understory. The 'woodland' site had a continuous cover of mesquite with a very sparse herbaceous understory. 813C of respired CO, during the monsoon period was -17.9 and -20.1 %o at the savanna site in 1998 and 1999, respectively, indicating approximately an equal contribution of C3 and C4 carbon to these fluxes. 813C of respired CO2 at the woodland site during the rainy period in 1999 ranged from -28.3 to -21.7 %o. Respiration from residual C4 carbon in the SOM may have contributed to the relatively positive 613C values measured at this site that is currently devoid of C4 grasses. 52H and 818O values of water evaporated from mesquite, C4 grass, and soil differed sub stantially, allowing these to be distinguished in Keeling plots of water va por. Mesquite, which had access to deeper soil moisture, had the greatest proportional contribution to evapotranspiration fluxes at both sites, espe cially as water availability declined during the post-monsoon drought. These results illustrate the utility of the Keeling plot approach for charc terizing ecosystem-atmosphere interactions in semi-arid environments. WILLIAMS, A. C. and B. C. MCCARTHY.

Paulownia tomentosa is a tree native to China that was introduced into the US in the 1840's. Disturbance has been hypothesized to allow P. tomentosa to become established in natural habitats. In this experiment, a range of habitats which vary in light availability were used to understand the im portance of this resource for the species and to assess the susceptibility of a range of managed habitats to invasion by P. tomentosa. Seedlings were planted into five replicates of three habitats: 6-yr-old clear cuts, forest edge, and intact forest. Plants were planted inside and outside of cages which prevented small mammal herbivory. Plants were harvested after one, two and three seasons of growth. Plants growing in clear cut areas, with the greatest amount of sunlight, were largest. Forest plants were an order of magnitude smaller, although some plants survived in each treatment. Plants allocated relatively more to below-ground biomass as they grew older. Plants in the forest sites had significantly greater specific leaf areas than those in clear cut locations. Mortality outside of cages was 70% in the first year, and near 100% in the following years. Although allocation to roots in the lower light treatments is contrary to resource allocation theory, this is due to the observation the plant's above-ground biomass often dies back over the winter months, especially when very young. So, survivors had to invest in below-ground biomass probably at the expense of above-ground biomass. Paulownia tomentosa seems to be able to establish only in areas where the canopy has been totally removed. Surprisingly, the forest edge was not conducive to growth. These data suggest that forest management techniques involving the complete removal of the overstory run the risk of encouraging invasion and establishment of Paulownia tomentosa. WILLIAMS, C.

Structure and biomass of a polar-latitude Eocene forest from the Canadian Arctic. Abundant fossil plant remains are preserved in the high-latitude middle Eocene deposits of the Buchanan Lake formation on Axel Heiberg Island, Nunavut Territory, Canada. Intact leaf litter, logs, and stumps preserved in situ as mummified remains present an opportunity to determine forest com position, structure, and productivity of a Taxodiaceae-dominated forest that once grew north of the Arctic Circle (paleolatitude 75-80? N). We exca vated 37 tree stems for dimensional analysis from mudstone and channel sand deposits. Stem length ranged from 1.0 m to 14.8 m (average = 3.2 m). Stem diameter ranged from less than 10 cm to greater than 75 cm (average = 32.2 cm). All stem wood was tentatively identified as Meta sequoia. A parabolic taper function was generated from the excavated stems and used to estimate canopy height as a function of stump diameter. Assuming that canopy dominant trees were represented by the largest in situ stumps we calculated a minimum canopy height of 33 m. Buried knots and the presence of branch-free bole wood indicate that this was most likely a closed canopy forest. We used stump diameter data (n =107, diameter &gt; 20 cm) and an uniform canopy height of 33 m to calculate parabolic stem volume and stem biomass for a 2227 m2 area of fossil forest. Stem volume equalled 2190 m3/ha and stem biomass equalled 591 Mg/ha.

Numerous studies of birds and mammals have proven that group size neg atively correlates to the amount of time individuals scan for predators. Be cause individuals in larger groups spend less time in vigilance, they can feed more efficiently. Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) form social units (called coveys with an average size of 11) during the non-breeding season, however little is known about their advantages. Consequently, we tested these relationships and examined whether these behaviors promote an optimal cov ey size. To observe the effect of differing group size of feeding/vigilance behavior, we created artificial covey sizes (4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) in a semi natural yet closed environment with both escape cover and an open feeding area. With the aid of a video camera, we recorded the amount of time in dividuals had their heads down (feeding or non scanning behavior) and the amount of time they have their heads up (scanning behavior). Additionally, we presented a raptor silhouette to record the time it took for the group to notice this potential threat, therefore indexing the overall vigilance of the group. Results indicate that as group size increased, they spent more time feeding in the open area (P = 0.01). Group size had no influence on the per cent of the covey that had its head up (P = 0.81). However, an increase in group size was positively correlated to the overall vigilance of the group (P = 0.02). Additionally, larger groups improved the odds of detecting a pred ator (P = 0.02). Therefore larger groups enjoyed greater awareness of pred ators but at a cost of less efficient feeding. Smaller groups appeared to feed more efficiently but had lower predator vigilance.

The ability of growing season length to control population structure over altitudinal and biogeographic scales is well appreciated, but its effect at the scale of meters is largely unexplored. Along the South Fork Eel River in northern California, the scarlet monkeyflower, Mimulus cardinalis, grows significantly larger at sites high above the channel as compared to sites low in the channel. It grows even larger at tributary confluences with the main stem of the river. We explored the hypothesis that this size variation is controlled by vastly different growing season lengths at these different positions in the channel. Due to the very gradual retreat of the water level following winter flooding, the period of emergence time ranges from four months for plants growing low in the channel to seven months for plants growing at tributary confluences. To distinguish the effects of growing season length from the possibility that the channel positions differ in habitat quality, we transplanted individuals into each site. If, rather than emergence times, the size differences reflected differences in nutrient or water avail ability, one would expect growth differences consistent with the natural size patterns. Instead, we found no differences in transplant growth between high, low, and tributary sites. A controlled growth experiment showed that plants emerging early in the year gain a distinct size advantage over those emerging later, even though growing conditions are less ideal. These results suggest that emergence time may be a key determinant of plant size along rivers and that changing climate may alter local scale population structure. WILLIAMS, M.,I Y. SHIMABOKURO,2 D.

Evidence of soil moisture stress in an Amazonian rain forest and implications for carbon uptake. Even in well-watered tropical rain forests, soil moisture can limit primary production. Because of high evapotranspiration rates, a few weeks of low precipitation can draw down soil moisture. This, coupled with the often low available water capacity of tropical soils, means that moisture stress may play a significant role in constraining the carbon uptake of tropical forests, especially in El Ninlo years with enhanced dry seasons. However, data on carbon-water relations in tropical forests are scarce; in surveys at three Bra zilian sites, the ABRACOS project found no indications of low dawn leaf water potentials (LWP), an indicator of moisture-stressed conditions. In No vember 1999, we sampled 13 primary forest sites within the Tapajos National Forest in Para, Brazil, recording stem size distributions, leaf area index (LAI), vegetation and soil carbon-nitrogen stocks, and dawn LWP Leaves were collected by shotgun from the upper canopy, and potentials were determined by scholander pressure bomb and corrected for height. While soil texture varied from sandy to clayey among sites, LAI showed little variation (mean 6.2, SE 0.14). At three sites the leaves of one or more species had water potentials more negative than -1 MPa, an indicator of low available soil moisture. But at all sites at least one species had water potentials more positive than -0.3 MPa. These data suggest both a spatial variation in the occurrence of soil moisture stress, but also a variation in the susceptibility of individual species. This susceptibility may depend upon access to deep soil moisture. We investigate the implications of these data on carbon uptake and biomass allocation, via simulations and sensitivity analyses using a pro cess-based model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.

A Bayesian habitat model for the southern Green Frog (Rana clamitans). Models that predict the probability of occurrence of wildlife species based on environmental measures are useful tools for resource managers. Several approaches, such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, and artificial neural networks, have been used for probability of occurrence models with varying degrees of success. We selected a different approach and developed a pattern recognition model based on Bayes' theorem to predict the prob ability of occurrence for the Northern Green Frog (Rana clamitans melan ota) across a landscape. The model was created using a subset of presence and absence locations from a three-year amphibian and reptile survey con ducted at Fort A.R Hill in Virginia. Environmental variables, including National Wetlands Inventory data, and information from locations of am phibians with similar habitat requirements were used to determine condi tional and prior probabilities for model input. The model was applied to the landscape of Fort A.P. Hill using ArcView GIS software to create a probability of occurrence map. Posterior probabilities of occurrence across the landscape ranged from 0.217-0.997. The model predicted presence lo cations with greater accuracy and precision than absence locations. The mean predicted probability of occurrence for all presence locations was 0.84 (s = 0.18) and 0.56 (s = 0.24) for all absence locations. The model predicted probabilities of occurrence over 0.75 for 85% of the presence locations. For 57% of the absence locations, the predicted probability of occurrence was less than 0.50. Overall, the Bayesian modeling approach performed successfully and may offer advantages over standard modeling approaches. WILLIAMS, N. M. University of Calgary, Calgary AB, Canada. Nectar requirements affect pollen foraging of a solitary bee: Exploration using linear-programming models. For herbivores, the need to obtain complementary essential nutrients can favor feeding on mixtures of plant species. Mixing is favored in cases where the distributions or harvesting efficiencies of essential nutrients are inverted among plant species. In natural populations, females of the solitary bee Osmia lignaria provisioned offspring on mixtures of pollen from Salix spp. and Hydrophyllum capitatum, which grew in discrete patches hundreds of meters apart. Females nesting in either patch flew the extra distance between patches and mixed pollen of the two species. Mixing cannot be explained by complementary pollen nutrients because in feeding trials lar vae grew equally well on either species alone. Pollen and nectar also are complementary essential nutrients for bees. Osmia lignaria females require pollen and nectar continuously during construction of provisions. I used linear-programming models to explore whether the need for nectar in ad dition to pollen could explain pollen mixing by female 0. lignaria. Pollen and nectar collection efficiencies are inverted between Salix and Hydro phyllum. Bees collect pollen faster at Salix, but collect nectar faster at Hydrophyllum. The model that incorporated only pollen requirements pre Oral Presentation Abstracts 233</page><page sequence="195">dicted pollen collection from only one plant species, nearly always Salix. When requirements for nectar and pollen were included, the model pre dicted mixing. Quantitatively, the model agreed with the observed pollen mixing throughout the season by bees nesting at all distances from the resources; however, the predicted and observed effects of distance to a resource showed inverted trends.

Fossil pollen records and AVHRR: Complementary sensors of the vegetation. Satellite-based instruments and fossil pollen records each are synoptic sensors of the vegetation that together potentially permit vegetation dynamics to be studied across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the information provided by the two sensors has never been compared explicitly. One difficulty is that fossil pollen records and satellites reflect different as pects of the vegetation: satellite-based sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) provide information about seasonal and interannual variations in biogeophysical variables such as leaf onset, leaf area, and vegetation productivity, whereas fossil pollen records indicate mil lennial-scale changes in the abundances of individual plant taxa. The concept of plant functional types provides the theoretical grounding to bridge the gap between the two sensors. Using a dataset of modern pollen samples from North America, we reclassify pollen taxa into functional categories and com pare the pollen abundances of the plant functional types to AVHRR-derived estimates of percent coverage. A search window of varying size was centered on each pollen site, and all pixels within the window were averaged. There is a good correlation between the pollen abundances of the various plant functional types and the AVHRR-derived estimates, with the best matches occurring at search window radii of 25 km or greater. With the correlation between the pollen and satellite data established, future research will include the development of transfer functions between pollen abundances and AVHRR-based estimates of biogeophysical variables so that these properties may be estimated for past ecosystems.

UV radiation and zooplankton distribution across vertical habitat gradients in three glacial lakes of differing transparency. The water column of stratified lakes can be viewed as a habitat gradient in both space and time where variations in temperature, predation, and food availability are well-recognized as important variables influencing the distri bution and abundance of zooplankton. To date, little consideration has been given to the role of UV radiation (UVR) in zooplankton communities. We used a 3 year database on three lakes of differing transparency to evaluate the relationship between potential exposure to solar UV and the vertical and seasonal distribution and abundance of several zooplankton species that dif fered in their UV tolerance. In most years, UV intensity in the surface mixed layer decreased from early stratification in May to late stratification in Sep tember, largely due to changes in the depth of the mixed layer. A higher frequency of statistically significant negative relationships between zooplank ton abundance and high UV habitats was observed in zooplankton taxa with low UV tolerance than in taxa with high UV tolerance. Cladocerans, which are the least UV tolerant of the three major taxa, tended to avoid the surface waters of the highest UV lake during periods of high UVR, while the much more UV-tolerant copepods and rotifers showed little or no evidence for avoidance of high UV habitats. Within lakes, the relationship between UV avoidance and taxon was evident only in the highest UVR lake. Visual pre dation is an unlikely alternative explanation because fish stocks and the po tential for visual predation are higher in the two lower UV lakes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that UV radiation influences zooplankton community structure and dynamics in UV-transparent lakes. WVILLIG, M. R., M. GORRESEN and R. B. STRAUSS.

The response of populations and communities to landscape configurations, including aspects of habitat fragmentation, is a major focus of ecology and conservation biology. Nonetheless, responses may be both taxon-specific and scale-dependent. We used a matrix of correlations and partial correlations between the density of a species or a measure of community structure, and a suite of eight landscape characteristics, to represent biotic responses to habitat configurations. We then developed a simulation model to evaluate similarities in landscape responses among species at the same spatial scale, or among scales for the same species (or assemblage). Correlation matrices can be similar based on the magnitude or direction of association between landscape features, and a biotic response variable, such as those related to the densities of species or the structure of assemblages (e.g., richness, even ness, and diversity). Attributes of the magnitude and direction of association may subsequently be combined via a meta-analysis to provide an overall test of significance. Moreover, the overall result can be decomposed into con stituent parts pertaining to particular landscape characteristics. We illustrate the utility of the approach with reference to the demographic and community level responses of bat species to habitat configurations at three spatial scales (areas corresponding to circles of 1, 3, and 5 km radius) in Interior Atlantic Rainforest of eastern Paraguay. Landscape features focused on forested hab itat, and included 8 indexes: relative area of forest cover, mean patch size, patch density, edge density, mean nearest neighbor distance, mean proximity, and mean shape index. Both species specific-differences in response to land scape configuration, and scale-dependence in those responses were detected by our model. This matrix-simulation approach has broad applicability to any ecological situation in which multiple intercorrelated factors contribute to patterns in space or time. WILMHOFF, C. D. and W H. N.

An organism's rate of growth affects its survival, reproduction, and ultimate fitness. Thus it is not surprising a vast amount of information is available concerning the factors (e.g. temperature, maintenance costs, and diet quality and quantity) affecting growth. The effect of feeding frequency on growth, however, has remained relatively uninvestigated. Feeding frequency has been associated with foraging mode: ambush (sit-and-wait) predators feed less frequently than actively foraging species. It has been proposed that intermit tent feeding frequencies exhibited by ambush predators have co-evolved with the digestive physiology of these organisms. Specifically ambush predators that feed frequently will incur higher costs associated with digestion (e.g. specific dynamic action). According to this proposal intermittent feeders should exhibit decreased growth rates if feeding frequency increases while total caloric intake remains unchanged. The present study tested the afore mentioned hypothesis by investigating the effects of feeding frequency and total caloric intake on growth in an intermittent feeder, the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus). A counterbalanced repeated measures design was used in which snakes were fed house mice (Mus musculus) according to either a weekly or monthly feeding frequency during two consecutive years. In 1998, animals were fed ad libitum during feeding trials (allowing total caloric intake to vary) whereas in 1999, animals were fed a total of 4 mice per month equaling approximately 20% of their body mass. Feeding frequency and the total mass of mice consumed demonstrated significant effects on the overall change in snake body mass during both years. Snakes exhibited higher growth rates during weekly feeding trials in both years calling into question the hypothesis that the physiology of intermittent feeders is adapted to an infrequent feeding frequency. The change in body mass per gram of mouse consumed was affected by feeding frequency in 1999 indicating that feeding frequency may be affecting growth by affecting digestive and/or assimilation efficiencies.

Plant diversity and ecosystem functioning: The importance of species evenness. Changes in land use, habitat fragmentation, and pollution often lead to reduced plant diversity. Diversity has two components: species richness (5), or the number of plant species in a given area, and species evenness (equitability, J), or how well distributed abundance or biomass is among 234 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="196">species within a community. Most studies on relationships between bio diversity and ecosystem functioning use S as the sole index of diversity, usually under the implicit assumption that S, J, and diversity (e.g. H') are all positively correlated. We conducted a literature review on relationships between these variables and found that S and J were positively correlated in vertebrate (r = 0.54, P&lt;0.001) and invertebrate (r = 0.51, P&lt;0.001) animal communities, and that both were excellent predictors of H' (0.58 &lt; r2 &lt; 0.82, all P's&lt;0.001), as expected. However, for plants, S was negatively related to J (r = -0.43, P&lt;0.001) and J accounted for more of the variation (r2 = 0.53, P&lt;0.001) in H' than did S (r2 = 0.06, P&lt;0.05). In a field experiment in a Texas grassland, we experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant species to test the hypotheses that reduced community J would lead to reductions in productivity and resource capture, and increases in the spread of spittle bug infestation of Solidago altissima. Plant density and S were kept constant. Initial (first year) results suggest that aboveground resource capture was largely unaf fected, but that the spread of spittle bugs was increased by experimentally reducing plant community J (P&lt;0.03). These results, when taken together, suggest that plant species evenness is more important than previously thought and that it should be taken into account in studies of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Response of aquatic macrophyte communities to rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) invasion: Contrasting results from long term vs. multiple lake data. The distribution of aquatic macrophytes has historically been attributed to physical and chemical characteristics of water bodies. However, in northern Wisconsin lakes the presence of the exotic rusty crayfish in many lakes and streams has had detrimental effects on aquatic macrophyte communities. Ob servational data in a suite of Northern Wisconsin Lakes demonstrates a strong negative relationship between macrophyte species richness and rusty crayfish abundance. In this paper, we compare long-term changes in an aquatic mac rophyte community in one lake to macrophyte communities in 24 area lakes with a gradient of native and rusty crayfish abundances to answer the general question: Can we predict the macrophyte community composition in lakes with and without invasive crayfish? In Trout Lake, WI, rusty crayfish invaded sometime between 1979 and 1981, taking over 15 years to disperse around the lake shore. During this time macrophyte species richness dropped from 15 to 3 species in sites occupied by rusty crayfish for the greatest amount of time and at the highest sustained abundances. In addition, species were lost over time in a predictable pattern: More delicate, annual species first, followed by more robust perennial species. This pattern is consistent with macrophyte communities in lakes differing in rusty crayfish abundance. How ever, the relationships are more complex due to lake landscape position which influences both water chemistry and lake accessibility for crayfish and plant propagules. WIMBERLY, M. C. and T A. SPIES. USDA Forest Service, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA. Examining current forest patterns in the context of historical dynamics: An example from the Pacific Northwest. Studies of historical landscapes play an important role in ecological as sessments, providing baselines to compare with current conditions and set ting potential targets for landscape restoration. These assessments must recognize that the assumption of a steady-state landscape is unrealistic and instead quantify a range of possible historical conditions. We used a spatial simulation model of wildfire regimes to estimate historical landscape pat terns in the Oregon Coast Range. We modeled landscape dynamics over the past 3,000 years based on fire regime parameters derived from paleo ecological, dendroecological, and historical research. The model accounted for spatial and temporal variation in fire frequency and severity, as well as the influences of wind, topography, and fuel accumulation on fire spread. Multiple simulation runs were used to generate probability distributions of landscape pattern under the historical disturbance regime, and these results were compared with several estimates of present-day spatial patterns. Mea surements of current landscape patterns were obtained using classified Landsat TM images of forest composition and structure. The amount and spatial pattern of old-growth forests varied considerably in our historical simulations. Old growth typically covered from 30-70% of the landscape, much of which was concentrated in one or more large patches &gt; 100,000 ha in size. Current estimates of total old growth area (&lt; 5% of the land scape) and patch sizes (&lt; 100 ha) were both lower than expected under the historical disturbance regime, even when past landscape variability and uncertainty in our current landscape measurements were taken into account.

Keystone species and community structure: Interactions among herbivores determine patterns of arthropod bio diversity. We sought to examine how different keystone herbivores, and interactions among these herbivores, contribute to arthropod diversity on juvenile cotton wood ramets. We first examined the effects of the beaver, Castor canadensis, on the surrounding arthropod community. Beaver felling of trees resulted in vigorously growing juvenile tissue on the remaining stump, which is also nutrient-rich and may be attractive to arthropods. When we experimentally simulated beaver felling, we found a 65% increase in arthropod species rich ness and a 75% increase in abundance on felled trees that were resprouting, compared to control trees. Beavers also affected keystone insect herbivores, which in turn affected the distribution of another 140 species of arthropods. For example, beavers determined the distribution of the leaf-feeding beetle, Chrysomela confluens, which is more commonly found on beaver resprout compared to nearby ramets that have not been attacked by beavers. To ex perimentally address the effect of leaf-feeding beetles on arthropod com munity structure, we paired cottonwood ramets and removed beetles from one set of trees. We found a 37% increase in arthropod species richness and a 68% increase in abundance on beetle-removal trees compared to control trees. Not only were beavers responsible for the distribution of beetles on juvenile cottonwoods, but a free-feeding aphid (Chaitophorus populicola) also determined beetle distribution. Free-feeding aphids excluded beetles from trees where they were present through their aggressive, tending ants, and these aphids negatively affected biodiversity. In addition to traditional analyses, we also present NMDS ordinations to illustrate how the interactions among keystone species result in a mosaic community that enhances biodi viersity. These results demonstrate the importance of keystone herbivores, and interactions among these herbivores, in structuring arthropod commu nities. WITH, K. A. and D. M. PAVUK. Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA. Threshold effects of landscape structure on biological control in agroecosystems. Habitat fragmentation may pose a serious impediment to the biological control of insect pests if it affects the search efficiency of natural enemies, reducing their ability to regulate pest populations. To test this hypothesis, we created experimental fractal landscapes of red clover across a gradient of habitat abundance and fragmentation to determine: 1) whether thresholds in landscape structure precipitated similar thresholds in the distribution of pea aphids; 2) how landscape structure differentially affected the search behavior of two aphidophagous ladybird beetles (Coleomegilla maculata vs. Harmonia axyridis); and, 3) what levels of habitat loss and fragmen tation affected the ability of these natural enemies to track and control aphid populations. Clover landscapes exhibited a lacunarity threshold below 20% habitat, when interpatch patches increased significantly, particularly in clumped landscapes. The distribution of aphids mirrored that of clover, but only the introduced biocontrol agent H. axyridis could track this threshold in aphid distribution. Given its greater mobility, H. axyridis was more ef fective than the indigenous C. maculatus at tracking aphids when they occurred at low patch occupancy, which is a requisite for successful bio control. If native predators are more susceptible to fragmentation, greater reliance may be placed on the introduction of exotic species for biocontrol. Although the success of biocontrol is usually determined by economic thresholds of damage, there are also ecological thresholds that must be surmounted in fragmented landscapes. WOLF, J. J., S. W.

In Rocky Mountain National Park and surrounding areas, Melilotus officinalis Oral Presentation Abstracts 235</page><page sequence="197">and M.alba (Fabaceae) invasion is becoming more prevalent, and may be impacting species composition and soil characteristics of native plant com munities. Prior research showed that montane grasslands invaded by Meli lotus species had lower numbers of native, grass and perennial species, higher numbers of exotic, forb and annual species and lower available nitrogen, net mineralization and soil moisture compared to non-invaded grasslands. We conducted two experiments, prescribed burning and nitrogen fertilization, to control Melilotus invasion, restore the community structure, and increase ni trogen availability in invaded grasslands. In the first experiment, I burned field plots in invaded and control patches. In the second experiment, I added nitrogen (NH4NO3) to field plots that were placed inside, on the edge of, and outside invasion. Fire eliminated Melilotus species throughout the season, increased the number of native, grass and perennial species in invaded patch es, facilitated the germination of new species, and increased available nitro gen. Fertilization increased overall species abundance, significantly increased the number of grass species, and had an initial negative impact on Melilotus growth. These experiments assessed the competitive ability of native species on Melilotus species and the role of disturbance regimes in exotic invasion. These changes found in species composition and soil resources demonstrate that Melilotus species' ability to invade may be negatively influenced by fire and added nitrogen. WOLF, M. and G. BATZLI.

The edge effect is important for determining effects of habitat fragmentation on resident populations of animals and has been studied extensively for woodland birds, but not for small mammals. The white-footed mouse (Per omyscus leucopus) is an important predator (seeds, eggs and arthropods) and an important prey item for avian and mammalian predators in eastern decid uous forests. Historically it has been considered an "edge species", i.e., pos itively affected by forest edges. Earlier studies of this species have shown higher densities in smaller woodlots, which was attributed to a relative in crease in woodland edge where these mice were thought to have higher densities. We trapped this species along edge-to-interior gradients in forested areas of east-central Illinois. Our results revealed that densities were signif icantly higher in the interior (&gt; 50 m into the woodland). Although these density patterns could be due to despotic behavior, additional results sug gested that microhabitat quality might be lower at woodland edges. Weights of adult females and preliminary measurements of risk of predation pointed to reduced microhabitat quality at the edge, although estimates of reproduc tive success (juveniles trapped per reproductive female) suggested the op posite. Overall, our study indicated that proximity to habitat edge could have a strong influence on population performance and habitat quality for small mammals. WONHAM, M. J.,l K. GOODELL,2 B.

Ecological and geographic patterns of impact in invaded communities: A meta-analysis. Charles Elton suggested that the success of introduced species varied with the latitude, degree of isolation (islands vs. continents), and degree of an thropogenic disturbance of the recipient community. We conducted a meta analysis to test these, and other, ecological predictions about patterns of im pact (as opposed to success) of introduced species. We quantitatively syn thesized results from 90 field studies that provided 618 different measures of impact of plant, insect, marine invertebrate, or fish invaders. We divided response variables into impacts at the individual, population, community or ecosystem levels, expressed as the response ratio (lnRR). Both latitude and the level of anthropogenic disturbance affected patterns of invasion impact. Population level impacts of fish, insect, and marine invertebrate invaders increased at higher latitudes. Individual, but not population level impacts of plants also increased with latitiude. For all taxa and levels together, there was no significant trend in impact with latitude. Population level impacts of plant invaders were greater in undisturbed communities than in disturbed com munities. In contrast, individual level impacts of all invaders together were higher in disturbed communities. For all other taxa and levels, the magnitude of impact did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed communities. We found no difference between islands and continents in the magnitude of in vasion impacts for any taxon or any level. The time elapsed between the onset of the invasion and the beginning of the study affected the magnitude of invader impact. The sooner a study began, the higher the measured impacts for all taxa and levels together. Population level impacts of plants and marine invaders were also higher in earlier studies. In contrast, population level impacts of fish increased with the time since invasion. Impacts were mar ginally significantly higher on native than on alien response species, for insect invaders at the population level. Impacts of invaders on native versus alien response species did not differ for all taxa and levels considered together. These patterns of invasion impact warrant future investigation of the mech anisms that drive them. WOOTTON, J. T The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA. Exploring mechanisms behind species diversity differences: Comparing Markov models of mussel beds and coral reefs. Ecologists have generated numerous hypotheses to explain community-wide differences in diversity among different habitats, most of which are based on widespread effects of dynamic processes such as disturbance, patterns and strengths of species interactions, and colonizing ability. Yet measuring these processes across many species is logistically daunting. Transitions in multi species Markov models are relatively easy to obtain empirically and poten tially reflect community-wide rates of processes hypothesized to affect di versity. I explored potential mechanisms leading to marked diversity differ ences by comparing Markov models from exposed pool and crest habitats of coral reefs in Australia (Ecology; richness = 81, evenness = 0.46-0.49) to a Washington state mussel bed model (richness = 32, evenness = 0.17). Species replacement rates, disturbance rates and colonization rates on coral reefs were 4.5, 5.8 and 0.27 times those in mussel beds, respectively, con sistent with several diversity hypotheses. Hypothesized tradeoffs between displacement ability or displacement risk and either disturbance risk or col onizing ability were not observed in either community. Contrary to expec tations, asymmetry of interactions among taxa was slightly higher on mussel beds than coral reefs, indicating that dominance intransitivities were not gen erally important in promoting diversity. The results illustrate that a compar ative Markov model approach may shed light on a community-wide basis on multiple, simultaneously-acting processes affecting diversity in different communities.

Historical versus hyrdologic controls on early successional dynam ics in beaver meadows. In the central Adrirondacks, beaver are extremely abundant and, by building dams, create a unique habitat type in the riparian zone. Because the meadows that form after beaver pond abandonment are composed primarily of plant species not found elsewhere in the landscape, ecosystem engineering by bea ver is responsible for a significant increase in species richness at the land scape scale. This increase in richness at the landscape scale is also due to the considerable variability in species richness (from 21 to 62 species in equivalent sampling areas) and composition between different meadows. Dif ferences in the composition of meadows could arise from variability in seed bank composition due to differences in site history or from variability in seed bank emergence due to drainage rates. Factors that affect seed bank com position, such as pond age and distance from seed sources are potentially influenced by the population dynamics of the ecosystem engineer whereas hydrologic features of a meadow are largely independent of the number of beaver in a landscape. Sediment was collected from 6 active beaver ponds and placed in mesocosms under high and low drainage rates. After one grow ing season, site had a significant effect on species richness (p = 0.001), but was only a minor determinant of community composition. The high drainage treatment had significantly higher species richness than the low drainage treatment (p &lt; 0.001), and drainage rate was the primary determinant of community structure. These results suggest that hydrologic factors such as drainage rate are the major determinants of early successional dynamics in beaver modified patches, and factors more directly influenced by the popu lation dynamics of beaver are of less importance in generating variability at the between meadow scale. 236 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page><page sequence="198">WRIGHT, K. K. and J. L. LI. Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA. Changing communities, changing scales: Context really IS ev erything. Changes in community structure along an environmental gradient may be continuous or patchy, depending on the interactions of community mem bers with both abiotic and biological factors. Twenty years ago, the River Continuum Concept proposed that streams reflect a series of continuous gradients from headwaters down stream. Others have since argued that the inherent environmental heterogeneity within streams results in patchiness not continuity. We suggest that this debate is primarily an issue of the scale of observation and how communities are described; both continuum and patch arguments are valid in their proper context. To explore this possibil ity, we sampled the physical habitat, fishes, macroinvertebrates, and algae at 20 sites along a 100km longitudinal profile of a stream in eastern Oregon. We compared reach- and site-scale changes in the structure of the benthic macroinvertebrate community from headwaters to mid-sized, 5th order reaches. We also examined the differences in community patterns using individual taxa versus functional groups to describe the community. Non metric multidimensional scaling was used to determine those physical and biological variables most strongly correlated with macroinvertebrate com munity structure. Relationships between community structure and the dif ferent variables at both reach and site scales were compared. The macroin vertebrate community was most strongly correlated with large-scale lon gitudinal physical gradients. We found that changes in scale and community descriptors will influence interpretations of community structure and also will affect interpretations of the environmental gradients associated with community structure. Some individual taxa displayed patchy distributions at the site scale and more continuous patterns at the reach scale, while others were patchy at both scales. In contrast, the distribution of all func tional feeding groups was patchy at both scales. This study illustrates that continuous and patchy aspects of stream systems are not mutually exclu sive.

The influence of ultravi olet radiation on phytoplankton growth rates and elemental composi tion. Solar radiation is a fundamental ecological factor that simultaneously affects physical, chemical, and biological processes in lake ecosystems. We exam ined the influence of solar radiation, including UV-A and UV-B on phyto plankton in situ growth rates and elemental composition in two boreal lakes at the Experimental Lakes Area (Ontario, Canada) with the use of dilution bioassays. Phytoplankton maximum growth rates and elemental composition were strongly influenced by UV-A and UV-B but the magnitude of change depended strongly on the time the experiment was done (spring versus sum mer). In general, the sensitivity to UV-A and UV-B decreased from spring to summer. Maximum growth rates were reduced by 23-87% in treatments that included both UV-A and UV-B compared to PAR only treatments. Ex cluding UV-B increased maximum growth by 8-50% compared to treatments which didn't filter any sunlight out. The carbon:phosphorus ratio (C:P) in creased in the UV-B exposed spring community and decreased in the UV-B exposed summer community. C:P ratios were not changed by UV-A or UV B in late summer. So far, factors such as temperature, PAR, and nutrients have been considered to be the primary ecological factors that control algal growth rates and elemental composition in lakes but we demonstrate here that UV-A and UV-B also play an important role in controlling these pro cesses.

Distinguishing the effects of environmental stress and forest succession on changes in the forest floor. When interpreting change over time in forest ecosystems, distinguishing the effects of forest succession from the effects of environmental stress can be difficult. The result may be a simplistic interpretation, citing a specific successional or environmental cause of forest change when both types may be occurring. We present two case studies of changes in the forest floor in northern hardwoods. First, the belief that 50% of soil organic matter is lost in the first 20 years after logging was based on a study comparing northern hardwood stands of different ages. We resampled a series of 13 such stands after an interval of 15 years, and found that the young stands were not, in fact, losing organic matter as rapidly as predicted from the original chron osequence study. The pattern of higher organic matter content in the forest floors of older stands compared to young stands could be equally well explained by changes in logging practices over the last century as by the aging of the stand. The observed pattern of forest floor organic matter as a function of stand age was previously interpreted as a successional pattern, ignoring changes in treatment history. In the second case study, observed losses of base cations from the forest floor were attributed to cation deple tion caused by acid rain and declining calcium deposition. We found that young stands were gaining base cations in the forest floor; losses of base cations were restricted to older stands. Differences in litter chemistry in stands of different ages may explain some of the pattern in cation gains and losses. In this case, the contribution of successional processes to cation loss had been overlooked in favor of environmental stress as the dominant mechanism behind the observed changes. Studies of environmental stress use repeated measures over time, but often don't consider stand age as a factor. Studies of successional change often assume that environmental fac tors remain constant. We were able to consider both forest succession and external factors because we repeatedly sampled stands of different ages. YEN, C. El and S. C.

Col lege science teacher beliefs and influence on helping preservice biology teachers to do science. This study sought to provide a in depth understanding of a college instruc tor's belief and conception of the progress of science while supervising an open-inquiry research program focused upon the ecological physiology of a tree frog, Chirixalus eiffingeri. The project involved 10 students in two spring semesters. Multiple data sources were established including class room discussions, group meetings, weekly reflective essays, interview tran scripts with instructor and students, and instructor- produced artifacts. All laboratory discussions were audio-taped and field notes during discussion and experiments were taken. We described a college-based researcher/ teacher educator's belief about an authentic learning environment based on designing and implementing more authentic science in an eco-physiological laboratory. The ways in which the instructor's previous research experience changed his views about science and science teaching, and the interaction between instructors and students that impacted on his practice were dis cussed. Finally, student cases were taken to illustrate over time, our un derstandings of students' views and the authentic learning environment. YOSHIDA, L. C.1 and E. B.

Short term 15 N additions to mycorrhizal Bromus madriten sis ssp. rubens and neighboring Artemisia californica. We examined whether mycorrhizae influence competition for N between an invasive and a native plant species. This goal was accomplished by exam ining the short term fate of 15NH4+ or 15N03- in mycorrhizal Bromus madri tensis ssp. rubens, an invasive annual grass, and Artemisia californica, a shrub of coastal sage scrub (CSS), while grown as neighbors in the field. A. californica and B. madritensis seeds were sown in a greenhouse, with or without native mycorrhizal inoculum, and seedlings were transplanted into field plots treated with the fungicide benomyl. Plants were placed in pairs 10 cm apart, either in monoculture or mixture. After 5 weeks, each plant pair was given 15NH4+ or 15N03- by soil injection and then harvested after 72 hr. Shoot biomass and '5NO3- concentration of A. californica were signifi cantly lower when grown in mixture than when grown in monoculture. Con versely, with respect to shoot 15N03- concentration, B. madritensis contained significantly greater concentrations of '5N in mixture than in monoculture. Mycorrhizae had a negative influence on the 'sN uptake of A. californica grown in mixture. These results suggest that B. madritensis is a better com petitor for N03- than A. californica. In natural vegetation where anthropo genic N03- deposition is increasing, as in southern California, the observed encroachment of B. madritensis into CSS may be in part related to N nutri tion.

The effects of habitat quality and heterogeneity on community inva sibility and species diversity in juvenile salmonids. Ecologists have long believed that habitat quality and heterogeneity influ ence species diversity. However, two factors have confounded our ability to directly test relevant hypotheses. First, changes in physical habitat are often related to changes in productivity, making it impossible to isolate the influence of either in determining species diversity. Second, the distinction between resources (what species consume) and habitat (the physical envi ronment) is often overlooked. In Pacific Northwest streams yearling coho salmon, and steelhead and cutthroat trout compete for foraging stations via interference competition. Coho occupy pools, steelhead occupy riffles, while less common cutthroat are intermediate in their habitat use. Juvenile survival is size dependent so growth rate provides a meaningful measure of fitness. I used artificial stream channels (high quality pools, low quality riffles, heterogeneous mixed) in an experiment that controlled resource pro ductivity, quality, and heterogeneity, to answer two questions about the relationship between physical habitat and species diversity. 1) Does habitat heterogeneity facilitate community invasibility by a rare ecological inter mediate? 2) How does habitat quality influence the relative fitness of the three species? Cutthroat trout grew faster in the heterogeneous habitat than in pools and riffles, where their growth rates were not different. The mean growth rates of the three species were more similar in low quality riffle habitats than in the mixed and pool habitats. These results are consistent with more general hypotheses about environmental quality and heteroge neity and species diversity. Habitat heterogeneity may increase species di versity by facilitating community invasion. Habitat quality may increase species diversity, but high quality habitat may decrease diversity by pro moting competitive asymmetries. YU, F,' K. P. PRICE,I R. LEE,' J.

Influences of inter- and intra-annual climatic variations on green-up of the inner Mongolian grasslands of China. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between climatic variation and grassland green-up patterns in central Asia. To characterize seasonal grassland developments, a time-series of biweekly composite NDVI data derived from AVHRR GAC imagery was conducted for the period January 1982 through December 1990. Vegetation phenological metrics (e.g., onset of green-up and duration of greenness) were then de rived from the time-series. Monthly precipitation and monthly mean tem perature data for this period were acquired for 26 meteorological stations in the Inner Mongolia, China. Multiple regression models were then run to examine the relationship between the climate data and timing of seasonal vegetation developments. Our results show that, between 1982 and 1990, a delay in the spring green-up in grasslands within the study area corre sponded with 1) an increase in winter temperature; 2) an earlier spring warm-up; and 3) a decrease in precipitation in May and June. Temperature was the primary influencing factor in areas with less than 200 mm annual precipitation on average. In grasslands with 300 mm mean annual precip itation, precipitation was the major factor. Effects on vegetation from both temperature and precipitation exhibited a significant lag time effect which could carry over one year. ZALLER, J. G.,' S. FLINT,' P. S. SEARLES,' M. M. CALDWELL,' C.

Effects of ultraviolet-B radiation on biomass allocation in a Carex fen ecosystem in Tierra del Fuego, Argen tina. The erosion of the stratospheric ozone layer and especially the pronounced ozone depletion during the austral spring and summer over southern South America may have consequences for ecosystem function because ozone is, beside clouds, the principal absorber of harmful ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) reaching the earth's surface. We studied the effect of ultraviolet-B radiation on biomass allocation in the field in a Carex fen ecosystem, lo cated near Ushuaia (55=F8S latitude), Tierra del Fuego (Argentina), and in growth chambers, by using different transparent plastic films that either transmit or attenuate UV-B radiation. In the field, root biomass in ingrowth cores in plots receiving near-ambient UV-B was only 50 to 70% of that in plots receiving reduced UV-B radiation. But, aboveground biomass pro duction in the field plots was unaffected by the different UV-B levels. Biomass allocation patterns of the two most dominant sedges of the fen (Carex curta and C. decidua)were examined in a growth chamber experi ment with two levels of UV-B radiation. Under these growth chamber con ditions, Carex curta root biomass was 20% lower under UV-B radiation corresponding approximately with present-day ambient solar UV-B in the field than under attenuated UV-B. This amounted to a 15% decrease of total biomass of this species. However, C. decidua was unaffected by UV B radiation in biomass allocation either above- or belowground but showed various responses to UV-B radiation in growth patterns (e.g. tiller size). Our findings demonstrate that even moderate changes in UV-B radiation (e.g. corresponding to those expected with current stratospheric ozone de pletion) may influence biomass allocation in sedges native to the fen eco systems and potentially affect the competitive relationships of these eco systems. ZHANG, F Y. Kean University, Union NJ 07083, USA. The Role of Coral Reefs in the Possible Upcoming Green House Effect. Coral reefs contribute to the greenhouse effect. Based on the predicted forthcoming greenhouse scenario, three models of atmospheric input of coral-produced CO2 are projected by computer simulations: 1) Coral-pro duced CO2 would remain constant with the present production level in the upcoming green house scenario. The amount of coral-produced CO2 would be 0.06 Gt C yearly, which represents 1% of the present anthropogenic C02; 2) Coral-produced CO2 would increase with time due to a catch-up upward growth in the presently non-productive reef areas if the sea level were to rise under the greenhouse effect. The amount of coral-produced CO2 would double the present rate if the sea level were to rise 6-7 mm/ year; and 3) Coral- produced CO2 would increase with time due both to a catch-up growth and an expansion of reef area distribution if both see level and water temperature near the tropical zone were to rise. Under this cir cumstance, the amount of coral-produced CO2 would reach four times the present rate, which would represent 4% of anthropogenic CO2. ZIV, Y. and 0. SHIMONI.

The body-size dependent distribution of Northern American mammals changes with ecological scale. On a local scale (habitat), species are dis tributed log-uniformly, while on the largest scale (North America), body size and species distribution form a right-skewed-log-normal relationship. Hypothesizing that this pattern change requires environmental heteroge neity, we tested the prediction that Israel with its high environmental het erogeneity, would possess a similar pattern change in the body-size depen dent distribution of its mammals. We collected geographic range and bio geographic data on all the Israeli mammals, excluding bats. We investigated three ecological scales: 1) All of Israel; 2) biogeographic zones-Mediter ranean, Irano-Turanian, and Saharo-Arabian; and 3) habitats-Tsipori meadow (Mediterranean), Borot Lotz steppe (Irano-Turanian), and sandy, rocky and loessal habitats of the Negev desert (Saharo-Arabian). The mam malian distribution of body size across all of Israel revealed a right-skewed log-normal relationship similar to that of North America. Furthermore, in specific habitats, the body-size distribution differed significantly from a log-normal distribution, indicating a relatively log-uniform distribution of body sizes. With respect to geographic range, middle-sized species had both a significantly higher coefficient of variance of their geographic range and a significantly lower minimal geographic range. The high similarity be tween North America and Israel in the change of body-size distribution with scale despite their huge difference in area suggests that environmental heterogeneity may serve as an important factor in determining this pattern. 238 Oral Presentation Abstracts</page></plain_text>
