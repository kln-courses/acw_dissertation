It can still be used.” A woman  remembers leaving the countryside to work in the factory for  fourteen years, then being laid off. “I’d never come late,” she  says, “and always did my best,” but at the age of forty-one,  with a child in school, she was reduced to selling flowers in  the street. Another woman tells of a boat journey she and her  family took to join the factory, during which she briefly went  ashore and lost her child in a crowd; out of patriotic fervor  and the need to keep solidarity with her co-workers, she re- boarded the boat and left the child behind. The tone here  and throughout seems more resigned, sad, or acquiescent  than angry. In the course of the interviews we learn that Factory 420  was once a privileged enclave containing shops, a cinema,  and recreational facilities; its workers were fed better than  other residents of Chengdu and even had their own bottling  plant for soft drinks.

A young television announcer,  representative of the rising bourgeoisie, tells us that he once  tried to work in Factory 420 but the job was so alienating that  “something snaps in your mind.” The film ends when a “per- sonal shopper” (Zhao Tao, one of Jia’s favorite actors) stands  high atop the 24 City project and tells us that as a child she  wasn’t studious and disliked Factory 420; she feels guilty  about following a path different from her family and is tearful Unreal city over their present condition.

WENDY AND LUCY The most popular 2008 picture about a dog and its owner was  Marley and Me, but Kelly Reichardt’s Wendy and Lucy, a  $300,000 wonder in an age when the average Hollywood re- lease costs over $10 million, is better by many miles. If, like  me, you think any story involving a homeless waif and her  missing pet is bound to be manipulative and cloying, you’re  wrong; this one avoids emotional pitfalls by virtue of restraint,  simplicity, and a rigorous avoidance of melodrama.

THE DUCHESS OF LANGEAIS Jacques Rivette’s film deserves analysis not only for its dra- matic power but also for its specific virtues as a costume pic- ture adapted from a nineteenth-century novella by Balzac  (an author Rivette has adapted before, in La Belle noiseuse,  1991). Set largely in Restoration Paris and told in flashback,  the film concerns a frustrated love affair between a  Napoleonic-era military officer, General Armand de  Montriveau (Guillaume Depardieu, who died in 2008), and  a flirtatious aristocrat, the Duchess of Langeais (Jeanne  Balibar). The general is a leonine, scowling romantic with a  wooden leg (Depardieu was an actual amputee) and the  duchess a raven-haired, ultramontane Catholic with the se- ductive body of a dancer. Rivette, who has long been inter- ested in the relation between theater and cinema, emphasizes  the theatrical nature of their affair. The duchess invites the  general to a series of private meetings in her home (her hus- band is permanently absent) and subjects him to The Big  Tease, carefully controlling her costume, hair, lighting, and  mise-en-scène, ultimately turning him into her “orderly.”  Five years later, after spurning him, then falling truly in love  with him, and then being rejected by him in return, she has Amour fou joined an order of barefoot Carmelites in Spain.

As a result, space takes precedence over plot, and Hou’s  fascinating long takes are among the chief sources of interest.  He typically sets the camera at one end of the apartment,  framing bodies in doorways, staging occasional entrances  and exits, now and then panning from one spot to another.

THE BAND’S VISIT Most of the films I’ve been discussing are about cities; but  my last choice, the charmingly funny The Band’s Visit, is a  film about what one of its characters calls “bloody nowhere.”  It tells the story of an eight-piece Egyptian military band in  ceremonial garb, the Alexandria Ceremonial Orchestra,  which is scheduled to give a concert at the Arab Cultural  Meandering life Center of an Israeli town called Petah Tikva.
