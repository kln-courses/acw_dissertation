Graff The Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" Social Science Histories and Historical Literacies In memoriam: Allan Sharlin (1950-1983) Social Science Historian At this meeting, we celebrate 25 years of the Social Science History As- sociation, the SSHA. With appreciation from all of us, I acknowledge the achievements of our founders and our long-time members. We stand on their shoulders metaphorically and historically. We mark this anniversary with a plenary president's "founder's session," a variety of retrospective and pro- spective panels, and the conference theme "looking backward and looking forward."' We also commemorate more than 25 years of groundbreaking re- Social Science History 25:4 (winter 2001).

(We mark no fewer years of controversy.)2 Twenty-five years is a long time in the history of academic disciplines and interdisciplines, a professional association, and professional life courses. The past quarter century has seen the rise, and sometimes the fall, of numerous "'new' histories." Some of the passages have been unusually boisterous. A cry, a refrain of history as a discipline in "crisis" has often accompanied them (see Bogue 1986, 1987; also Fox-Genovese &amp; Lasch-Quinn 1999; Higham 1989; Novick 1988; Ross 1995, 1998, among the literature). For me, these years also embrace my graduate education, my professional vocation as an interdisci- plinary and comparative social historian, and my practice as a social science historian. Despite the recognized achievements of the fields that constitute the SSHA, the status of contemporary social science history is clouded by criti- cism that risks misconception and distortion. In her recent presidential ad- dress to the American Historical Association, Joyce Appleby (1998: 5, 6) com- plimented social historians but then silenced them: "The new social history swept all before it for a decade or more"--despite its failure to move from data to understanding. By the late 1970s, she said, "social history settled into middle age, its disruptive potential spent."3 Acknowledging "the rich con- tribution of much of what was once called the 'new social history,' " Eugene Genovese (1999: 6-7) condemned "much of the history now practiced in the academy [for] becoming increasingly specialized, careerist, bureaucra- tized, and politically conformist. .... Contemporary academic history is being systematically gutted of the breadth, the drama, and, most dangerously, the tragedy that have accounted for its abiding hold over the public imagination." Ironically (to choose a word), Genovese's Historical Society may reflect the historical moment of its founding much like the SSHA reflected its time. Each presented itself as new, in opposition to established or mainstream practice, general and open, and restorative. For the SSHA, the problem was "tradi- tional" or "narrative" history; for Genovese's Historical Society, it was the "new histories," like social science history, that came of age in the decades after the 1960s. Their ideals and agendas differ accordingly.4 More sympathetic to</page><page sequence="3">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 485 social science history, Dorothy Ross (1998: 93) observed that "those involved in SSHA's original aims tend to be disappointed" with the outcomes. SSHA's twenty-fifth anniversary provides an appropriate--perhaps a necessary--occasion to review our own history: to reconsider social science history and the SSHA in their historical contexts. As the terms of criticism old and new illustrate, certain fundamental misconceptions plague the field and promote misunderstanding, at times widely. I seek to clarify that understand- ing by returning to the historical grounds of our origins and development. By renewing that connection, I propose alternative perspectives on several major issues about which misconstruals are common. Toward that reconceptualization, I offer a set of intersecting reflections. First, perceptions of a discipline of history in crisis are inseparable from con- siderations of the rise of new histories, such as social science history. Notions of disciplinary crises and reconstructions of conceptions and practices within disciplines intricately interrelate and powerfully influence each other. That recognition aids efforts to understand crises, new histories, and disciplinary change. Second, despite many images to the contrary, the history of social science history reveals not one but many social science histories. Third, espe- cially when taken together, those histories contradict many claims of declen- sion-of social science history in decline--claims that do violence to social science history and the SSHA. Fourth, at its best social science history trans- forms the organization and practice of historical research by fostering collabo- ration. Fifth, social science history makes crucial contributions to important questions in social science, theory, and public discourse, as well as to history. The historical study of literacy provides a rich case in point.5 Finally, social science histories may help advance special modes of understanding that I call historical literacies. I present these arguments selectively and briefly. Together they counter common complaints about social science history and offer a different perspec- tive on a vital, ongoing enterprise. Portions of four intersecting stories provide our ground: the history of social science history, the history of the SSHA, the history of the study of literacy, and my own history in social science history. My predecessors have addressed many of the relevant threads and themes. (See Appendix A for a listing of all the presidential addresses to date.) Lee Benson urged us to "change social science to change the world"; Louise</page><page sequence="4">486 Social Science History Tilly sought to unite social science history with people's history. Allan Bogue taught us about the SSHA's early history and our "data's dilemmas." William Aydelotte searched for ideas, and William Flanigan queried the conduct of our inquiries. Deirdre McCloskey located the historical squabbles of our times within the battles of "ancients and moderns." Barbara Hanawalt listened to the "voices of social history records" and Barbara Laslett to those of gender. Later, Eric Monkkonen taught lessons from social science history's history, and Susan Watkins explored social networks in history and the social net- works of social science history. Tamara Hareven asked, "What difference does it make?" and emphasized the significance of the life course. Theda Skocpol and Ira Katznelson discussed historical problems and promises of democracy, while Roger Schofield and Michael Haines addressed those in demography. All these speak to important chapters in the story of social science history, and they appear in varying combinations of the programmatic, perspectival, promotional, polemical, and personal. As the anniversary moment dictates, my task differs, although I build on their contributions. Join me as I reflect on our histories past and future. We historians know how tricky this can be. William Taylor's (1992: xviii) comment on his own writings across the 1970s and 1980s about New York City urban culture cap- ture the spirit: "They are shots ... at a moving target." 6 For us, the historical and the social science disciplines have changed, raising questions about the definitions and practices of both social science history and history. So, too, have the university environments in which most of us labor, along with the world that surrounds us (see Pescosolido and Aminzade 1999). There is also the impact of our own aging, individually and collectively--the life course and generations of social science history - and our patterns of reproduction and production. Professional Biography and Collective Experience Temporally, my education and professional life overlap almost completely with the emergence and institutionalization of social science history. Histori- cal, social, and individual times merge and blur. As an undergraduate history major at Northwestern University in the last years of the 1960s, I was gen- erally unaware explicitly that "new histories" were forming. Among assigned</page><page sequence="5">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 487 course readings, I encountered many new, but now classic works of a historio- graphic age dawning. The new histories also had the power to shock, we soon learned. (Younger social science historians may not comprehend how exciting this could be, or the strong passions provoked, pro and con.7) In a senior honors seminar and a few other courses, I first met Stephan Thernstrom's Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century City (1964), Peter Laslett's The World We Have Lost (1965), Charles Tilly's The Vendle (1964), Lawrence Stone's The Crisis of the Aristocracy, 1558-1641 (1965), Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), E. P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class (1963), and Barring- ton Moore Jr.'s Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peas- ant in the Making of the Modern World (1966) among the ur-texts and ex- emplars of the "new" that was beginning to rock some of the pillars of the mainstream historical and social science professions. All had been published very recently. I met most of these texts again in graduate seminars. I first heard about counterfactuals and canals, slavery's possible profitability, count- ing occupational and geographic movements, and the early "hyphenated" his- tories. An avowedly interdisciplinary orientation and a renewed, sometimes passionate sense of the new breadth, the new possibilities for studying the past, and novel uses of history accompanied the presentation and reception of these books. The new histories that would bloom like a thousand flowers (and some weeds) during the next two decades were only partly visible, but my professors' excitement and the new works themselves were infectious.8 When we sang "the times they are a-changin'," sometimes we referred to times past. The social and political excitement of the mid-1960s contributed to the aura. I entered graduate school in 1970. That was a special time. In that one year, John Demos (A Little Commonwealth: Family Life in Plymouth Colony; 1970), Philip Greven Jr. (Four Generations: Population, Land, and Family in Colonial Andover, Massachusetts; 1970), and Kenneth Lockridge (A New England Town, The First Hundred Years: Dedham, Massachusetts, 1636-1736; 1970) published books that changed the terms of American social history. Regardless of differ- ences, each of these works was radically shaped by working on the boundaries of social science and history and by influences outside the borders of American history. The fundamental journals Comparative Studies in Society and History, Journal of Social History, Historical Methods, and Journal of Interdisciplinary History all began to publish within a few years before or after 1970. Another</page><page sequence="6">488 Social Science History wave of new history and social science history journals (including Social Sci- ence History, Journal of Family History, Social History, Journal of Historical Sociology, Studies in American Political Development, Journal of the History of Sexuality, and three journals in women's history, among others), anthologies, and book series soon joined them.9 The ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Re- search) and the Newberry Library offered the needed grounds for learning methods and techniques, primarily but not exclusively quantitative methods, one badge of the "new" of this era. Those research practices became insepa- rably associated with social science history, like identification or membership cards.1' Small conferences and special sessions at annual meetings contrib- uted directly to making personal connections, sparking incipient networks, and forming community(ies) within and across major areas of new histories. They forged links in the chains of historical practices and disciplinary changes that underlay the diffusion of new histories and new historians. In some cases, they led to more formal associations and research groups." Unaware of perceptions of an impending crisis of the historical discipline as threatened by the new histories, I journeyed north to the University of Toronto to pursue graduate work in history. (I was only a bit more aware of the impending job crisis.) I expected to concentrate in modern British and European history. During my first year, on the recommendation of another student, I met Michael B. Katz, already known for pioneering research in the "new social history" of education, who became my mentor. He introduced me to the practice of social science history and the new social history (see Katz 1968, 1969). In 1970, Katz was in the early stages of a long-term quantitative study of urban social structure that centered on industrializing Hamilton, Ontario. Around this research he built a group of faculty, graduate students, and staff. The project's collective, collaborative, and continuing dimensions con- trasted markedly with the individualism and isolation of traditional histori- cal practice, which represented concrete embodiments of social science his- tory. Katz's study blurred some of the boundaries between graduate research assistant work and serious involvement in empirical research. It promoted shared access to research materials; constructive collective responses to work in progress (in regular seminar meetings); collaborative searches for concep- tual approaches and learning methods; and students and faculty working,</page><page sequence="7">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 489 sometimes publishing, together. The project also helped support some of the direct and indirect costs of student research. A multilayered intellectual and personal support group, the project team was also self-consciously and pur- posefully interdisciplinary.12 For some students, the social organization of social science history was different. As a mode of doctoral-level training, its collective and collaborative dimensions have great advantages.13 At its best, social science history is a real boost to graduate education and the conduct of research - especially, but not only, large-scale social science historical research. It can be exhilarating, both demanding and supportive, and it can cushion some of the shock of the new. For me, the Toronto experience was formative. I became a new social historian and a quantitative social science historian. I acquired a professional identity, one that was beginning to be recognized, along with knowledge and skills.14 No less significant, my long involvement with the historical study of liter- acy began in Katz's seminar (see Graff 1979, 1987, 1995b, and the following discussion).15 True to the times, and the fervor of early practitioners, the organiza- tion and conduct of social science history constituted a kind of countercul- ture (or subculture) for new historians--or so they may be viewed histori- cally, with all the ambiguities that the term conveys. This was part of its shock effect - and its appeal. Among the relevant signs - some exaggerated beyond recognition -I identify the collective mode of social organization with prin- ciples of sharing and exchange highly praised, method as a membership card (mainly but not only quantitative method), conceptual obsessiveness, numeri- cal biases, and materialist foundations for group maintenance. Specialized professional language (discourse or jargon, depending on one's point of view, or observer bias)-- also new to historians - bound many of us, while it distin- guished and separated us from others. And, of course, there was an obsession with the "new." These characteristics could take on an aura of cultishness with secret signs; special kinds of behavior and appearance; or in-groupiness, performative elements (distributing and reviewing tables, certain patterns of speech), and intellection. Many of us were seldom seen without an armload of printout or stacks of IBM cards to feed the mainframe. While that might distinguish us from humanities grad students, that we also carried piles of books separated us from social science and science grads. A certain blend of historical and social science rhetoric and attempts at requisite humor charac-</page><page sequence="8">490 Social Science History terized our talk. In this construction, the SSHA, especially its early meetings, resembled, if not a rock festival, then perhaps a teach-in (more than, say, a cockfight or a love-in). By the early to mid-1970s, social science and other new histories' shock of the new redounded loudly of divisions throughout the profession. Doubts expressed by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (1962) a decade earlier--among other "humanistic" objections to "history by the numbers" and other deviations from master narratives and normative expectations - reverberated and were amplified. Brash overstatements by some new historians about the quality of their history did not lessen the often shrill, (but not always) ill-informed de- nunciations and wails of woe. The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history's supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, concep- tual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of "good" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in "great men" and "great events," trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors. To defenders of history as they knew it, the disci- pline was in crisis, and the pursuit of the new was a major cause. "Crisis" embraced an extraordinarily wide range of indications, as the preceding list illustrates; it also impinged on issues of identity and confidence. The sins of the sons and daughters seemed without end (see Schlesinger 1962; Himmel- farb 1987; Handlin 1979; Barzun 1974; Stone 1977, 1979, 1987; see also Novick 1988; Higham 1989; Ross 1998).16 "New Histories" and "Crisis in History" as History (and as Historical Phenomenon) Despite its self-proclaimed novelty, what was identified by the 1970s as social science history (in today's cant, for historians, the "social science" or the "quantitative turn"; for social scientists, the "historical turn") was neither as new nor as shocking as outcries suggested. Nor was there one "new history." Important precedents of new histories span the history of history writing. A number have used the New History label. From the mid-to-late nineteenth</page><page sequence="9">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 491 through the early twentieth centuries, the professionalization of academic disciplines and their institutionalization in universities magnified the impor- tance of claims for novelty and the counterclaims against novelty that they sparked.With other academic disciplines, history's discourse privileges claims of novelty about important aspects of the discipline and its practices (while also privileging certain opposing claims in favor of tradition, trusted "old ways"): discovery, invention, revision, renaissance, and reformation. Not coincidentally, history also displays a discourse of crisis. Claims about new histories, including recent social science history, bear complicated con- nections with concerns about academic disciplines that are perceived to be in crisis. Observers differ dramatically, sometimes famously, in their diagnoses about whether disciplinary crises give rise to new histories or whether the new histories themselves precipitate or accompany crises. Those who favor the pursuit of the new tend to see novelty as forged in response to alleged crisis conditions in a field of inquiry. Those opposed to the new view it as cause, accompaniment, or symptom of a dire crisis. I lean more on the side of new histories as responses to perceived problems than as causes of alleged crises. Others disagree (see Hamerow 1987; Higham 1989; Novick 1988; Ross 1998). Over the long term, the rises and falls of new histories are inseparable from perceptions of history in crisis. Grasping their connection, in conjunc- tion with seeing both new histories and crises as multiple and as arising from differing historical contexts, leads us toward a new understanding of what we might call historical change.'7 Contests over the origins of various new histories (social science his- tory in particular) and the "origin myths" that they stimulate, nicely exhibit these historiographic (and cultural) phenomena. Are they the work of "great male" researchers? solitary work in the laboratory or collective action? re- sults of "scientific method"? work within or at the boundaries of "normal sci- ence" because of perceived "breakdowns" in normal practice? knowledge-, problem-, or data-driven? shaped primarily by internal or external factors? actions of historians struggling to save their discipline from the threat of social scientists? Are the origins located or were they found early in regional politi- cal and social history research of the 1890s by Frederick Jackson Turner or A. Laurence Lowell, or by the Progressive New Historians led byJ. H. Robin- son and Charles Beard? New Economic Historians point to Alfred Conrad's and John Meyer's seminal papers on slavery's economics and the early Clio-</page><page sequence="10">492 Social Science History metrics meetings. New Political and New Social Historians have their parallels and parables. With respect to Cliometrics, Fogel (1983: 8) relates: "Placing a specific date on the birth of cliometrics is quite arbitrary. ... The diffi- culty is with the metaphor. Cliometrics was not 'born.' It gradually emerged from a complex set of developments in the social sciences, in history, and in applied mathematics, much of which had already taken place before World War II" (see also Jensen 1969; Bogue 1987; cf. Hamerow 1987). These "com- plex set[s] of developments" differ for different new histories and different components of social science history. That qualification supports the conclu- sion that new histories, including social science history, have long had many rooms. They embrace a variety of interests and approaches, theories and meth- ods, regardless of expectations of homogeneity. There are subcultures within the counterculture of social science history's congregants. Over the long term, we can construe modern history as a succession of one new history after another. Successive proclamations of crises punctu- ate the landscape: the many threatened deaths of history (see Megill 1985, 1995; White 1966, 1978, 1987; Cohen 1986, 1998). The new histories of the last half-century took root over a longer span. According to I. Olibarri (1995: 4, 6), they derive from historicism, "the 'new way' of understanding history [that] goes back to the first part of the nineteenth century," and from "di- verse proposals" for new historical approaches at the turn of the 20th cen- tury. From that genealogy came "the chief 'new histories' which in the last fifty years have . . . brought about a real revolution in historical practice": the Annales school; Marxist historiography; the historians centered around Past and Present; American "social scientific" history; and German Gesell- schaftsgeschichte (or the "Bielefeld school") (ibid.: 5-6).18 Olabarri (ibid.: 11) observes, bracingly: "Today it seems that all the 'new histories' which ... are 'modern histories,' are in crisis." Many (if not all) of history's periodic crises and contested new waves, especially in the recent era, revolve around relationships with social science disciplines, theories, and methods. History's variable location between the arts and humanities on the one hand and the social sciences on the other has long been a source of ambiguity, ambivalence, and conflict. "Beginning early in the century . . . there has been a succession of 'new histories' based on alli- ances with the social sciences," observes Ross (1998: 85). After World War II American social scientists and historians "joined again, this time around a</page><page sequence="11">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 493 more structural analytic model of historiography" (ibid.: 89; see also Higham 1989; Novick 1988). "Historians who look to the other social sciences tend to be dissatisfied with what they see as their own discipline's conceptual sloppi- ness, its reliance on anecdotal evidence, its happy privileging of certain stories over others," explains Eric Monkkonen (1994: 4); "the seeming 'hardness' of the other social sciences, hardness in the sense of rigor, conceptual precision, and the explicit prior stipulation of what constitutes an adequate explana- tion," attracts them (see also Bogue 1986: 137; Katz et al. 1982: ix-xiii). Those attributes constitute core elements in the crucible from which social science history and the SSHA emerged. The explosion of new histories after the mid-twentieth century stemmed from the more or less simultaneous remaking of global relationships and social orders within the Western democracies; shifting and conflicting intellectual, cultural, and ideological currents; developments in universities, disciplines, and academic professions; and the promises and problems of seemingly cease- less transformations. Numerous social groups cried out for recognition of their voices and their histories. They defined themselves by race or ethnicity, class or gender, age or associations, and geography or common historical ex- periences. These new histories were forged in a world in which overarching hopes and fears proved difficult to separate. A sense of one crisis after another inside and outside the academy closely accompanied the proliferation of one new history after another. Scholars struggled to respond, maintain, or redefine themselves. These were expansive, heady times; they were also tense with challenges, competition, insecurity, and "troubles" (to use Higham's word). These phenomena combined to create the outlines of social science his- tory among the many new histories and the many crises. Eric Hobsbawm (1972a: 4) finds a first factor in the linkage of global social change to a "general historicization of the social sciences." Revolutions and struggles for eman- cipation around the world captured the attention of governments, research organizations, and social scientists "to what are essentially problems of his- toric transformations. These were subjects which had hitherto been outside, or at best on the margins of, academic orthodoxy in the social sciences and had increasingly been neglected by historians" (ibid.; see also Eley 1996; C. Tilly 1981; Ross 1998; and recent issues of Daedalus). In Hobsbawm's view, "the progressive infiltration of history" went far- thest fastest in economics with "the deliberate specialization of economic</page><page sequence="12">494 Social Science History history to fit in with the requirements of the rapidly developing economic theory and analysis." Economics was joined by "the remarkable and world- wide growth of sociology as an academic subject and fashion." In turn, both economics and sociology influenced the stunning rise of historical demog- raphy (Hobsbawm 1972a: 4; C. Tilly 1981; Fogel 1975, 1983; Higham 1989). Internal and external forces, pushes and pulls, reinforced each other. On the one hand, as Fogel (1983: 8-9) recounts in the case of economics: by the 1950s "as historians and historically minded social scientists became familiar with [statistical methods developed to study group behavior in biology and physi- cal anthropology, and later to estimate social scientific models] they began to experiment with their applicability to historical issues." On the other hand, as Charles Tilly (1981: 38) tells for other disciplines: "History began to mat- ter." Social science disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, and political science "reached out to reestablish their historical connections," with par- ticular interest in industrialization, rebellion, and family structure: "First, the social-scientific work that had been proceeding in history doubled back on the social sciences. The success of historical demography provided a model ... Historical studies of crime, of voting, of urban structure, of social mobility were sufficiently fruitful or provocative .... Second (and more important), disillusion with models of modernization and development turned students of large-scale social change toward history" (ibid.: 37-38). Within a global context, social upheavals at home stimulated interests in new histories and social science history. "The political conflict of the 1960s created new historiographical energies and directions," Ross (1998: 91) em- phasizes. The civil rights movement, the Vietnam war, youth and women's movements, and changes in higher education shattered the "American Mo- ment" and its faith in the virtues of consensus. The post-World War II de- mocratization of higher education opened the historical profession to men and increasingly to women, making it more representative of American society. From the New Left, the profession gained a wider range of radical views that embraced liberal democratic, populist, Marxist, feminist, and contemporary radical traditions. "It produced a social-cultural history that focused on the 'inarticulate,' the working class, racial minorities, and women, those who had been marginalized in American history and left out of its historiography" (ibid.). These new social histories "from the bottom up" were also influenced by the achievements of European historiography.</page><page sequence="13">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 495 "Many varieties of historiography flowed from these influences," Ross (ibid.) rightly states. They include the social science history that cohered in the mid-1970s around the SSHA. Significantly, that new history overlapped with two others: a historical literature that was allied with modernization theories and the cultural history of marginalized groups that were encouraged by the activism of the 1960s (ibid.).19 Almost every one of the many topics generated its own new history, with increasing participation of scholars from groups that were new to academic professions. Almost all the topics found their way into the emerging social science history, and into the SSHA, despite important differences in ap- proaches and emphases. Research that is influenced by modernization theory, the "organizational synthesis," and sociocultural histories of race, gender, class, and ethnicity has always been present (if not dominating or at a consis- tent level).20 Absence of such research from many images of the SSHA and social science history is striking (see Ross 1998; Higham 1989; Monkkonen Pres. Add.; see also Bogue 1983, 1986, 1987 and Baker 1999; on differences, see the following discussion). Overly narrow, usually (but not always) denigrat- ing images of social science history exaggerate the omnipresence of quantifi- cation; they caricature social science abstractness, obtuseness, and abstruse- ness--and prose; and they overemphasize homogeneity among researchers and results. They sometimes also brand the approach as ideologically conser- vative (although for other critics it is ideologically liberal or radical). And they miss the overlap and interplay of interests among proliferating new histories, which I consider to be one of the most interesting dimensions. The SSHA's principal objective, drafted by Allan Bogue and enshrined in the constitution, declares: "The major purpose of the Social Science His- tory Association is to improve the quality of historical explanation in every manner possible, but particularly by encouraging the selective use and adap- tation in historical teaching and research of relevant theories and methods from related disciplines, particularly the social sciences." Bogue's (1986) own construction of "systematic revisionism" captures this nicely (better, for ex- ample, than QUASSH; see Kousser 1980). Perhaps greater clarity is found in a conception of social science histories than in a singular social science his- tory. Questions about social science history as theory or practice also arise (see the SSHA presidential addresses, especially those of Benson, Aydelotte, and L. Tilly; see also Bogue, Floud, and C. Tilly; for critiques, see Handlin 1971,</page><page sequence="14">496 Social Science History 1975, 1979; Himmelfarb 1975, 1984, 1987; Genovese and Fox-Genovese 1982). (Excerpts from the SSHA constitution and mission statements of purpose from the journal appear in Appendix B.) Social science history and new history are not synonymous or inter- changeable. Neither are they fixed categories. They are dynamic historical constructions. They share a great deal (although this fact is neglected by com- mon images or shorthand descriptions). We find their often-rich interplay more common in practice (at the SSHA but elsewhere, too) than in proclama- tions. The "new social history" is probably the best example of this tangled web. It is joined by other fields that overflow boundaries that sag and blur under efforts to construct them more rigidly than research practices and agen- das merit: from cultural or family history to race, gender, immigration, labor, and various hyphenated histories, and many SSHA networks, for example.21 With the cumulative effects of the new histories and the social science histories, history changed. And it was a shock. Theodore Rabb (1982: 316-317) reflected: "Starting in the decade after 1945, however, when an exponential in- crease in the number of new directions for historical research began to develop, confidence about subject matter became less and less attainable." Beset with growth in volume of publications and numbers of Ph.D.s, "assimilating all of this newness--whether it be the use of computers and psychoanalysis, the borrowing from demography and dendrochronology, or the study of hitherto non-subjects, such as fertility and festivals, madness and magic . . . dazzles and dismays, because it appears to have ruptured the traditional bounds of the discipline beyond repair" (ibid.: 316-17).22 Societal transformations- Charles Tilly's (1984) "big structures, large processes" --challenged disciplines that were divided between factions in support of the "new" or the "old," opportunity or crisis, and "correct" posi- tions on the conception and value of history in structures of inquiry and pursuits of knowledge. Historians and social scientists (others, too) reacted contradictorily. Responses to circumstances declared to be "crises" stimu- lated "new histories" and resistance to them. "Probably the most important of all [historian's reactions in the 1950s] was a general defensiveness and fear of the new and strange," avers Peter Novick (1988: 385). The ascending social sciences attracted historians "who saw an alliance with sociology or politi- cal science as a strategy for checking history's relative decline vis- i-vis those disciplines" (ibid.: 384). Others responded to the same situation as "a mortal</page><page sequence="15">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 497 challenge, mandating intransigent resistance." Some scorned new methods; others greeted findings with skepticism or ridicule. To Eugene Genovese and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese (1982: 183), "the social scientist or social historian, in full retreat from the last vestiges of anthropomorphism, scrambles for a theory to consecrate the obscurantism of some seamless abstraction immune to the vagaries of the human will." That there were social scientists who be- lieved and said that historians "would be most usefully employed in supplying them with reliable data" provoked some of the historical discipline's shrill- est defensive stances. Differences widened capaciously. The multiple shocks of the new rippled outward (Novick 1988: 384; see also Higham 1989; Ross 1998; C. Tilly 1981; Bogue 1986, 1987). No wonder that in his history Higham (1989) surveys the postwar era as "a time of troubles." However problematic for understanding new histories as historical phenomena, these labels reflect contemporary clashes.23 Conceptual, theoretical, and interpretive elements cut in different di- rections. As status, material support, intellectual authority, and theoretical foundations all appeared to grow, post-World War II American social science attracted historians who sought to understand a nation that was seemingly dis- abled by its own success. At the same time, the social sciences "promised relief from historians' epistemological problems" (Ross 1998: 90). For some histori- ans, this relief meant the explicit influence of social science theory (often sup- porting "ironic" interpretations); for others, it meant more formal use of social science concepts (status anxiety, for example); and for others again, it meant the use of scientific methods. A growing number enlisted in the move toward (social) science, although conceptions of "science" and "social science" (and "history") varied widely. Some social scientists turned toward history as em- pirical social scientists but also in efforts to redefine their own epistemology and identity (Ross 1998: 92; see also Higham 1989; Monkkonen Pres. Add.; Ross 1991, 1995, 1998; Sewell 1992, 1996; cf. Bogue 1983, 1986, 1987; Ayde- lotte 1971; C. Tilly 1981; Kousser 1980; and both "hard" and "soft" visions in the SSHA presidential addresses). In the 1950s and 1960s, an increasing number of political and economic historians argued that "it was scientific method that produced novel findings and reliable generalizations, not borrowed concepts" (Ross 1998: 91). They used theory, but increasingly they urged historians to adopt scientific meth- ods, especially quantitative methods. A new social history "from the bottom</page><page sequence="16">498 Social Science History up" aimed to correct impressionistic and overgeneralized stories by using large data sets and statistical techniques (Ross 1998: 91). They launched the Social Science History Association (best account is Bogue 1987). The Social Science History Association as History This was not the first time that new historians made, or responded to, such claims and advanced such agendas. But this time their effect was greatest, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Never more than a substantial minority, their influence has been significant. History changed, albeit within certain broad limits. Bogue's 1986 (157) conclusion holds: founding social science historians "had a vision of a new era in which different approaches and better tools would bring them closer to a definitive resolution of long-standing historiographic controversies.... Their influence is found today in rows of books, substantial runs of new periodicals, recently founded organizations and great changes in old professional institutions and their programmes. Some old historiographic controversies have indeed been closed and many unforeseen ones begun." He stopped short of"a verdict," beyond a conviction that their dream's "influence will long be felt." Neither the historical profession (and its mainstream practices) nor its departments and other institutions, writ large, were transformed or remade. Nor were the social sciences (see Bogue 1986, 1987; Kousser 1989; Rey- nolds 1998; see also Baker 1999, Burke 1992; Higham 1989; Kammen 1980; Novick 1988; Ross 1998; Stearns 1980; Stone 1977, 1979, 1987; and presiden- tial addresses, especially by Clausen [1988], Hareven [1996], and Monkkonen [1994]). Social science history changed (Sewell 1992; Maynes 1992; Monk- konen 1994; McDonald 1996a; Hunt 1989; Bonnell and Hunt 1999; Stein- metz 1999). Fewer and less frequent, newer new histories have changed, too (McDonald 1996a; Hunt 1989; Bonnell and Hunt 1999; Steinmetz 1999). The shocks of the new and their impact were disruptive at times. Nevertheless, Bogue's (1986: 147) riposte to those who complained that new histories "hope- lessly splintered the discipline" stands: "Is the degree of scatteration within the profession unreasonable or deleterious? Given the increase in numbers ... much of the broadening of interest and endeavor appears to be reasonable."</page><page sequence="17">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 499 Not all agreed (Bogue 1986, 1987; cf. AHA Forum 1989; Hamerow 1987; Handlin 1979; Himmelfarb 1987). Among the most important of those results is the SSHA. Incorporated in Michigan in 1974, SSHA represented the shared interests of a group of historians and historically minded social scientists who began to develop and promote a "new political history" amid other "new histories." Their common experience at a 1957 Social Science Research Council conference on early American political behavior, and service on the American Historical Asso- ciation's Ad Hoc Committee on the Use of Quantitative Data in History led them to seek professional change in the form of a new scholarly organization. Bringing historians together with social scientists and developing a historical foundation for political and social research, the ICPSR helped move SSHA's founders toward action.24 "New economic historians" contributed another influence, constituent group, and "new history." Adding "new social historians" rapidly expanded the circle of scholars likely to associate with and benefit from a group of other "new historians." Motives ranged widely, from Lee Benson's desire to "change social science to change the world"--establishing general laws of human behavior along the way - to William Aydelotte's goal of improving the practice of historical generalization and explanation, with others in between. Many new historians felt the need for an intellectual and collegial home in their search for new ways "to improve the quality of historical explanation in every manner possible" (SSHA Constitution; see Appendix B). Distin- guished by an impressively wide range of interests, they were also marked by an exceptional presence of new Ph.D.s (like myself) and graduate students. Planning took place from 1972 to 1974. A regional conference met in Madi- son in 1975. Under the umbrella of SSHA's broad objectives, the memorable founding and first annual meeting took place at the University of Pennsylva- nia in the fall of 1976 (see Bogue 1986, 1987; Monkkonen Pres. Add. and other presidential addresses).25 The SSHA began with great expectations: "The early meetings ... were characterized by an intellectual elan and a sense of being on the cut- ting edge of scholarship that was most remarkable," recalled Bogue (1987: 338).26 "In its earliest years a good proportion of the group represented the feeling that quantification equaled social science and that social science his-</page><page sequence="18">500 Social Science History tory was going to conquer the world," Monkkonen (Pres. Add. 1994: 162) re- membered.27 Never disappearing, that spirit has ebbed and flowed over the years. From the first, the SSHA embraced an array of new histories and new historians. Despite contrary images and caricatures, SSHA was never the province mainly of quantitative political or economic historians.28 Benson, Fogel, and others had proselytized for some years, trumpeting the transfor- mative powers of a social science history that would rewrite history, settle long-standing questions, and resolve uncertainties with its better methods and increased explanatory power. Winning support, paving SSHA's way, they also sparked a varied - sometimes vociferous - opposition. A number of histori- ans, some of them prominent, disagreed, loudly (and famously, led by Briden- baugh's [1963] notorious "bitch-goddess QUANTIFICATION" slur during his American History Association presidential address (see also Schlesinger 1962; Hexter 1971a, 1971b; Handlin 1979; Himmelfarb 1987; Barzun 1974). Lines immediately formed behind the banners of social science history: pro or con, followed by a parade of dichotomies. SSHA inherited a mixed geneal- ogy, based at least as much on myths, images, and exaggerations as on actual historical practices. Great expectations inescapably lead to disappointment. For Bogue (1986: 338), "once organized, SSHA drifted rapidly into the pattern of activities found in most small learned societies. Association leaders devoted their atten- tion mainly to sponsoring an annual meeting and publishing a society journal. These functions were in no way reprehensible or trivial," but they lacked the early "elan." They marked a "drift toward conventionality" and accommo- dation with changing circumstances inside and outside the academy (see also Monkkonen Pres. Add.). At the same time, SSHA innovated in developing a structure of networks that represent members' major interests--and rise and fall with the fate of those interests, draw members together, plan the annual meeting program, and attract new recruits. They play instrumental roles in maintaining and sus- taining the organization, mandating and undergirding multiple "new" social science histories. Network activity - "an unexpected bonus" - became a hall- mark or signature of the association, an essential ingredient in SSHA's suc- cess (Bogue 1987: 338).29 As I learned as a graduate student, and occasionally thereafter, social science history can be organizationally innovative. The question of social science history's legacy does not stop here. A</page><page sequence="19">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 501 sense of declension is not hard to find: "Those involved in SSHA's original aims tend to be disappointed," surmises Ross (1998: 93), "whether histori- ans devoted to the original quantitative scientific program or social scientists who wanted to transform the social sciences into genuinely historicist disci- plines." Despite her awareness of social science history's multiple "theoreti- cal strains," for Ross "quantitative American social science predominated" (ibid.).30 She writes in a trope of (satirical) declension: "During the 1980s, the scientific fervor of the social science history program receded, the vic- tim of powerful critiques of the results of quantitative history and the broad attack on positivism" (92-93). Equating a (relative) decline of science in the form of quantification with disappointment in social science history, she (ibid.: 92-93) also senses a balance shifting toward social scientists. Her conclusion is muted and ambiguous: "The SSHA nonetheless remains one of the few forums where historians, sociologists, political scientists, and historical econo- mists can listen to one another. ... but it is a long way from the original efforts to reconstitute American historiography" (ibid.).31 Ross's unusually sensitive view is incomplete and misleading. She defines social science history too narrowly. She also neglects the significance of the many and changing social science histories; the SSHA's and, more generally, social science history's organizational advances (and organizational culture); and the historical contexts of social science history's "life and times." "Sci- entific fervor receded" from the founding years. With that shift, the qualities that Bogue subsumes under "elan" faded. This is neither surprising nor ex- ceptional. "Scientific fervor" also receded across the social sciences, and views of science changed. A "drift toward conventionality" may constitute possible grounds for disappointment on one level. Yet all these shifts and drifts are signs of SSHA's establishment, institutionalization, maturation, even a "rou- tinization of charisma." 32 Echoing others, Ross's (partial) misreading raises important questions about SSHA's identity. They include the roles of quan- tification and science; the varieties of social science histories; standards for evaluation (and expectations); and relationships among intellectual currents, professional patterns, and organizational embodiments in the final quarter of the twentieth century and the first years of the twenty-first. SSHA began amid perceptions of crisis. From its origins, the SSHA was attached to certain ideals within historical and social scientific scholarship around which there existed great divisions. Despite changes within disciplines</page><page sequence="20">502 Social Science History since the 1960s, opposing intellectual currents and their myths persist. This is an ambivalent historical legacy. SSHA's own history provides important clarification. Let us review. First, consider definitions of social science history and the role of quan- tification. If the SSHA and social science history have one identifying image, it is quantitative methods. They are a powerful symbol and image. As central as quantification is to social science history and to research in many major branches, it is neither requirement nor test. To presume greater equivalence or synonymy risks erring epistemologically and methodologically (and descrip- tively), and confusing the two. Useful definitions of social science history make greater claims for social science history than primarily identifying with the quantitative. These defi- nitions distinguish or at least avoid equating the two.33 In their 1971 report, History as Social Science, David Landes and Charles Tilly (1971: 71-73) list three characteristics of "most (though not all) work in social-scientific his- tory." First is collective history (some call it collective biography). Second is the use of theoretical concepts and models to understand patterns of col- lective behavior.34 Third is extensive reliance on comparison.35s Landes and Tilly (1971: 73) deem quantification one of the "secondary shibboleths of his- tory as social science," while Tilly (1981) notes that quantification is not "the essence." For Bogue (1987: 341), quantification was "never a sine qua non of social science history." 36 An adequate conception of social science history reflects its preeminent place among the new histories: the expansion of historians' subjects and ques- tions to embrace "virtually every human activity"; a widened range of sources, methods, and conceptual tools to study them; analysis of structures and pro- cesses prized over events; and a strong if not exclusive interest in "history from below," rather than identification with a particular set of methods (see Burke 1992; Sewell 1992; Baker 1999). Second, social science history is more accurately conceptualized and understood in terms of plural or multiple social science histories. Although at times, certain approaches - "empirical, behaviorist, quantitative social sci- ence practiced in the United States" - appear to dominate, there has never been one form or formula. The presumption of a single or predominating social science history camouflages important differences among scholars who follow its paths. The SSHA's networks reflect the blending of similarities and</page><page sequence="21">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 503 differences in practice, along with their changes, topically, methodologically, conceptually, and theoretically. Recognizing SSHA's diversity enhances our appreciation of its achievements (and limits). From the first, students of the working class, women, culture, and other areas shared physical and intellec- tual space with "hardcore" quantifiers. Where there were once networks in intellectual history and psychohistory, there is now strong interest in narra- tive and culture. Over the years, the mix but not the fact of diversity has changed.37 Varied paths distinguish the journeys that bring different scholars to the SSHA, and then differentiate practitioners across its networks. In the early years, as later, "scientific fervor" had a range of meanings and applications. Participants found different alternatives to normal science. "Some of the social scientists who joined the SSHA in the mid-1970s shared the historians' scientific aspirations," reports Ross (1998: 93); "But most had a very different agenda: while retaining the goal of a generalizing science, they wanted to move beyond a narrow positivism in social science and import some of the herme- neutic understanding and contextual richness of historiography." Monkkonen (1994: 6-7) quips: "As characterized by Abbott, the issue of quantification in the 1970s worked this way: some historians ran toward it, seeking in quanti- tative methods the rigor and precision which they felt history lacked, while simultaneously some sociologists (and by extension, other social scientists) ran away from it for what they saw as its false promise of scientificity." 38 Third, expectations about the course of social science history's develop- ment and questions about appropriate standards for its evaluation are com- plicated problems. Circumstances at the time of SSHA's founding have long influenced the terms and tenor of evaluations. Images of social science history, new histories, and quantification continue to serve as symbols of crisis and division. Too often, the question of numbers becomes a single standard for failure or success; examples taken out of context are turned into hyperbole.39 In contrast, expectations were sometimes so high that they were unlikely to be met. The danger of "great expectations" supplies the foundation for the "disappointment" perceived by Ross. History was not "remade." The social sciences were not "transformed into genuinely historical disciplines." Social science history did not "conquer the world" (Ross 1998). Unattainable great expectations were used in arguments that denied significance to social sci- ence histories. For promoters, expectations were spurs to action, modes of</page><page sequence="22">504 Social Science History recruitment, and ways to attract interest (up to a point). For the faithful, dis- appointment most often was a temporary condition that faded in the continu- ing challenge of a "new" past, buoyed by the progress that had been made. Although it was more moderate, that progress was also cumulative, as my pre- decessors Tamara Hareven and Michael Haines illustrate for the life course and the mortality transition (Pres. Add.). "A drift toward conventionality"; a recession of "scientific fervor"; a "broadened ... array of interests repre- sented in the SSHA": Those qualities speak to the intellectual and institu- tional processes by which new subjects and approaches become part of the academy (see Ross 1998: 93). The SSHA is one major product and symbol of that negotiation (see Bogue 1986, 1987; Higham 1989; Ross 1998; Monkkonen 1994; Abbott 1991, 1999).40 Change accompanies development. The SSHA has grown substantially. Its influence is acknowledged widely, and it is honored with imitation by the European Social Science History Association. The membership embraces im- pressive numbers of graduate students and international scholars. The net- works spread quantitatively and qualitatively into areas that were not even contemplated in the 1960s and 1970s. Conceptions of method and theory grow beyond the boundaries of the early years. From "new political" and "new economic" histories to "new social," then "new cultural" histories, "turns" historical and linguistic and beyond [the cultural turn]-new histories and social science histories continue to intermingle and interchange (Bonnell and Hunt 1999; Steinmetz 1999).41 Social Science History publishes critiques from the vantage of changing science and changing humanities, as well as changing social science, as those domains cross each other, blurring boundaries.42 With aging and growth also come challenges.43 Within the SSHA inter- ests shift. Narrative, culture, gender, the state, certain aspects of religion, labor, race/ethnicity, and attendant theory and methods lately attract renewed attention (Baker 1999; Sewell et al. 1992). Cultural and anthropological topics, including discourse, appeared on early SSHA programs but were not major currents. Interest in them grew in accord with larger intellectual trends. Nar- rative, for example, became a more abiding interest by the mid-to-late 1980s. SSHA seems to have come late to certain rising intellectual currents; it has had implicit limits and exclusions. Conceptions (often implicit) of both social science and history were sometimes narrow, but at other times or with other topics, they were expansive. Topics and themes that were not ordinarily as-</page><page sequence="23">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 505 sociated, at least rhetorically, with SSHA were present as a kind of "cultural underground." SSHA has changed over its quarter century (changes over which practitioners conflict) (see Abbott 1991; Baker 1999; Bonnell and Hunt 1999; Hunt 1989; McDonald 1996). Introducing a special section on narratives and social identities in Social Science History in 1992, William H. Sewell Jr. (1992: 479), emphasized a "de- parture" from the usual contents of Social Science History and the vision of "social-scientifically informed historical study that has dominated the SSHA since its founding." He argues that the articles on narrative mark "a global change" in the relationship of history to the humanities. Sewell (ibid.: 481) speaks to the dynamism, potential, and limits of a maturing social science history that no longer saw the humanities as "an atheoretical backwash." Dur- ing the 1970s and 1980s, he narrates, the humanities disciplines were trans- formed. They became "at least as theoretically self-conscious as the social sci- ences." At the same time, "many social science historians became dissatisfied with the intrinsic limitations of quantification, which proved of only slight value in reconstructing the life worlds of the past populations it enumerated so precisely." In the 1970s, a number of social science historians turned to cultural anthropology for "inspiration." In the 1980s, some also turned to literary theory and poststructuralist philosophy. Among a "significant sub- set" of historically minded social scientists, Sewell claims, narrative is "one of the emerging points of intersection" in a developing intellectual collaboration with the humanities (ibid.: 480; see also Hunt 1989; Bonnell and Hunt 1999; Steinmetz 1999; McDonald 1996).44 Therein lay one form of reorientation and renewal for social science historians. Responding to the same limitations of social science history - "leav[ing] the experiences of identifiable people as historical agents by the wayside as it reconstructed the powerful historical processes that contextualized individual lives. .. . losing sight of the larger agenda aimed at understanding and ex- plaining social relations in transformation"--M. J. Maynes (1992: 518; 1995) identifies a related course for reorientation. While Sewell turned to cultural anthropology, literary theory, and contemporary philosophy, Maynes's path lay in interpreting personal documents through feminist theory. That two sophisticated quantitative social science historians follow new paths within the SSHA attests to the ability to probe, grow, and, much of the time, tolerate difference. That they rub against boundaries, meet resistance,</page><page sequence="24">506 Social Science History and challenge "traditions," themselves not so old, is unsurprising and poten- tially constructive. Despite social science history's real achievements, it has had limits, even blinders and biases, along the lines of theory and methods, disciplines, and constellations of fields of inquiry. This, I think, is inescapable. It teaches lessons that are practical and theoretical.45 Social Science Histories and Historical Literacies With other social science historians whose interests span a wide spectrum, Sewell and Maynes sketch possible "new" social science histories for the twenty-first century. Constituting a part of what I call, collectively, social sci- ence histories, they look not only to the social sciences but also to the humani- ties, the sciences, and developing interdisciplines. Many paths and practices in social science history constitute distinct social science histories. Many of us have known this (almost) all along but have not embraced our differences within commonality publicly and proudly. The number of social science his- tories, and their breadth, grows. Under a shared umbrella, pluralism--con- sciously and consistently rigorous, systematic, theoretical, interdisciplinary, and comparative--is a great asset. Newer social science histories build on social science history's strengths and achievements, including its democratic inclusiveness, as they attempt to fulfill their promise and resolve limitations (see L. Tilly Pres. Add.; Floud 1984; see also L. Tilly 1989 for the debate in women's/feminist history; Baker 1999). More a shift in conceptualization than in semantics, social science his- tories represent a major outcome (in progress) from SSHA's history. Social science histories raise major questions about that past and about the future. Toward a conclusion, I touch briefly on two connected clusters of issues: the project of interdisciplinarity and the study of literacy. Taking "historical soci- ology" as an example, we note persisting theoretical and practical problems in linking disciplines and working interdisciplinarily. This concern of social sci- ence historians has no singular or easy answers. Although it is a more compli- cated matter than most early participants in the SSHA presumed, it continues to teach and provoke us, as it continues to add more than a few complica- tions. Closely related is the rich example of the study of literacy considered as social science history.46 Literacy studies represent one important field in</page><page sequence="25">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 507 which social science history makes wide-ranging contributions to social sci- ence, history, and matters of public debate and policy. Studies of literacy may also point toward some ways in which social science histories can promote special modes of understanding. From the early days of social science history, the promise of a historical sociology attracted many social scientists and historians. It is prominent in SSHA's foundation and legacy. Within a continuing debate on the status of the "historical turn" in social science, the enterprise of historical sociology sparks a number of sharp criticisms (see McDonald 1996a, 1996b; Skocpol 1984; Skocpol et al. 1987; C. Tilly 1981; Hunt 1989; Bonnell and Hunt 1999; see also Ross 1991, 1995, 1998; Stone 1977, 1979). The story told is a tale of op- portunities lost, the power of disciplines, the limits of interdisciplinarity, but also real advances. The lessons of historical sociology are ambiguous. They en- courage us to think hard about shared or overlapping but also differing visions for social science histories in the next 25 years. Reflecting on two decades' efforts, Abbott (1991: 201) observes that "one might have predicted that 'as sociology meets history' (C. Tilly 1981), there would arise a demand for synthesis, for a history-as-social-science that would combine the best of both disciplines. . . . But the synthesis has not arrived." Criticism points to several contributing factors. For Abbott, the quantitative history that took on the name "social science history" is one: it drew on a re- stricted range of social science (207). Craig Calhoun (1996: 327) elaborates: "Framing the project of historical sociology in methodological rather than substantive terms" weakened links to social theory and reduced "much his- torical sociology to conventional mainstream sociological research using data from the past. The thematic importance of historicity is too often lost." 47 In other words, a restricted conception of history paralleled that of social science. Historians and sociologists "profoundly" misunderstood each other's disciplinary differences and agendas, the story continues. The central ques- tion - "whether the two disciplines are really about the same things or some- thing different" -has not been pursued, suggests Abbott (1991: 211, 213). It is no mean question, even for the SSHA. In its absence, and in their practice, historians and social scientists make "some unique combination of choices among these dichotomies": generalizing and particularizing, quantitative and qualitative, radical and nonradical, political and social, macro and micro (ibid.: 211). Abbott (ibid.: 230) judges this "a terrible loss": "Conceptualization of</page><page sequence="26">508 Social Science History social reality as processes of complex events is fundamental to the most effec- tive theoretical traditions in both history and sociology. Only by following it can we address, much less solve, the problem of multiple temporal layers of change that lies at the heart of the history/sociology split" (see also Cal- houn 1995, 1998; Sewell 1996).48 Questions of theory and conceptualization compound, perhaps inseparably, those of method. The "failure" of an ideal, theoretically robust, and synthetic interdisci- pline of historical sociology exemplifies other encounters among the disci- plines of social science history. It marks certain limitations and boundaries on interdisciplinary interrelations in which disciplines dialectically engage and transform each other. Instructively, it can direct us to major issues, sometimes unstated, in the linking of disciplines and what we might expect from such meetings. But it also restricts our ability to learn from disciplinary differences and their points in common, and thus increase our ability to probe and con- front them. Perhaps there are limits to the radius of "historical" and "social science" turns. That question, and its implications for social science histories, calls out for attention at the SSHA. "Failure" on that level does relatively little to impugn the ongoing enter- prises that constitute the SSHA or obscure the achievements of more than three decades. Few social science historians have aspirations, or even consider- ations, on that dimension. The distinctions made by the critics of historical sociology identify social sciences histories that differ in ideals and agendas. Regardless, many - perhaps most - social science historians prefer to main- tain their disciplinary identity and home base while participating actively in the SSHA. For better or worse, our employment and curricular structures rest on that foundation. In his critique, Abbott (1991: 230) recognizes, perhaps ironically, the ex- panse of common ground before us: "Firm connections between history and sociology have tended to occur only within substantive areas or within gen- eral approaches like Marxism or feminism." The SSHA program comprises a roster of those "substantive areas." Reaching out, selectively, across his- tory and the social sciences, those connections drive the SSHA and most of social science history today. They connect researchers across disciplinary, chronological, geographic, and conceptual bases. Broadly topical or thematic, they share aspects of conceptualization, theory and method, and understand- ing- and differences as well. They are embodied and achieve institutional ex-</page><page sequence="27">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 509 pression in the networks, which are flexible, historical constructions. Today networks range from criminal justice, economics, and education to family/ demography, migration, politics, race/ethnicity, states/societies, urban, and women/gender. There we find social science histories past and future. Prominent among those "substantive areas" is the study of literacy, which has been an established interest of social science historians across disciplines and a presence at SSHA meetings from the early years. The history of lit- eracy is also my long-time companion; it was the lure that attracted me to the new social science history almost 30 years ago and engaged me long after (see for example Graff 1979, 1987, 1993, 1995b). As it happens, literacy and history have much in common. Both are prone to perceptions of crisis and decline - precipitous declines that are sometimes claimed to threaten civili- zation as we know it. Both are susceptible to mythologization and are hard to define and measure. Social science histories of literacies challenge those charges, among other presumptions about literacy that have been influential in many academic disciplines, in public debate, and among policymakers (see Hirsch 1987; Gagnon and the Bradley Commission 1989; Stearns 1991, 1993; Graff 1979, 1987, 1989, 1993, 1995b, 1999b; Kaestle et al. 1991; Barton 1994; Barton and Hamilton 1998). The history of literacy is an instructive example of social science history with respect to its founding and the course of its devel- opment. It followed a path common to social science histories (see, in general for what follows, Graff 1987; Kaestle et al. 1991). On the one hand, pioneering social science historians of the 1960s and 1970s confronted a diffuse histori- cal literature that made easy (if poorly documented) generalizations about the distribution of literacy across populations and also (even though vaguely) the great significance of literacy's presence, absence, or degree of diffusion. On the other hand, they confronted a social science literature, some of it with theoretical aspirations, generally derived from modernization approaches that placed literacy squarely among the requisites for progress by individuals and by groups. The historical writing rested on a thin base of mainly anecdotal evi- dence, with little concern about its accuracy or representativeness. The social science writing included modernization theories with stages and threshold levels, macrosocial correlations from aggregate data, and, occasionally, con- temporary case studies. Writings in both areas treated literacy - whether con- ceptually or empirically-uncritically and as unproblematic. Literacy's key relationships, they assumed, were simple, linear, and direct, and its impact</page><page sequence="28">510 Social Science History was universally powerful. At the same time, most scholarly writing neglected the subject of literacy even when it was highly relevant. Critical of earlier work, the new literacy studies that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s questioned the received wisdom that tied literacy directly to indi- vidual and societal development, from social mobility (+) and criminal acts (-) to revolutions in industry (+), fertility (-), and democracy (+). Skeptical about modernization models and with at least some of the conclusions taken from aggregative data, researchers who come from an impressive number of nations, disciplines, and specializations were wary about imprecise formula- tions, levels of generalization, and their evidential basis. Critical and revision- ist in intellectual orientation, a generation of scholars sought to test old and newer ideas, hypotheses, and theories with reliable and relevant data. Specifically, this meant identifying measures of literacy that, ideally, were direct, systematic, routinely generated, longitudinal, and comparable - quan- titative indicators all - and building machine-readable databases to promote their use and enhance their accessibility to other researchers. In Sweden, this meant church registers; in France, marriage and military records; in Brit- ain, marriage and census records; and in North America, manuscript census records. The dream of a precisely comparative history remains illusive. Liter- acy studies have taught us to make comparisons more carefully, often restrict- ing their range. As a recognizable field of literacy studies emerged, literacy's significance as an important variable for many subjects across the realms of social science histories was accepted. Its relevance expanded just as expecta- tions of its universal powers were qualified and contextualized.49 Earlier expectations (and theories) that literacy's contribution to shap- ing or changing nations, and the men and women within them, was universal, unmediated, independent, and powerful have been quashed. Literacy - that is, literacy by itself--is now seldom conceptualized as independently trans- formative. To the contrary, we now anticipate and recognize its impact to be shaped by specific historical circumstances as context-dependent, compli- cated rather than simple, incomplete or uneven, interactive rather than de- terminative, and mediated by a host of other intervening factors of a personal, structural, or cultural historical nature rather than universal. In other words, literacy is a historical variable, and it is historically variable. For example, literacy's students understand that the equation or syn- onymy of literacy acquisition with institutions that we call schools and with</page><page sequence="29">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 511 childhood is itself a fairly recent development. Other arrangements were once common. We recognize that the environment in which one learns to read or write has a major influence on the level of ability to use and the likely use of those skills. Social attributes (including ascribed characteristics like gender, race, ethnicity, and class) and historical contexts, which are shaped by time and place, mediate literacy's impacts, for example, on chances for social or geo- graphic mobility. Literacy seems to have a more direct influence on longer dis- tance migration. When established widely, that relationship will carry major implications for the historical study of both sending and receiving societies and for the immigrants. Literacy's links with economic development are both direct and indirect, multiple, and contradictory. For example, its value to skilled artisans may differ radically from its import for unskilled workers. Lit- eracy levels sometimes rise as an effect rather than a cause of industrialization. Industrialization may depress literacy levels through its negative impact on schooling chances for the young, while over a longer term its contribution may be more positive. Experiences of learning literacy include cognitive and non- cognitive influences. This is not to suggest that literacy should be construed as any less important, but that its historical roles are complicated and his- torically variable. Today, it is difficult to generalize broadly about literacy as a historical factor. But that only makes it a more compelling subject. Literacy studies have succeeded in establishing a new historical field where there was none. Statistical time series developed for many geographic areas and historical eras limit cavalier generalizations about literacy rates and their strong meanings, whether by demographers, economists, linguists, or lit- erary historians. Three decades of scholarship have transformed how social science historians and many other students conceptualize literacy. Both con- temporary and historical theories that embrace literacy are undergoing major revision because of this body of research and recent studies that point in simi- lar directions. The view that literacy's importance and influences depend on specific social and historical contexts - which, in effect, give literacy its mean- ings: that literacy's impacts are mediated and restricted, that its effects are social and particular, that literacy must be understood as one among a number of communication media and technologies - replaces an unquestioned cer- tainty that literacy's powers were universal, independent, and determinative. Social science historians know how recently these ideas about literacy's transforming and developmental powers were central to theories that held</page><page sequence="30">512 Social Science History sway in major areas of economics, demography, psychology, sociology, anthro- pology, history, and the humanities. The challenge to probe previous under- standings with suitable historical data and test the "strong" theories of literacy attests to the contributions that social science history can make. The SSHA is one of the major arenas that foster this kind of critical and constructively revisionist research. It provides a place where ideas and data are exchanged - formally as written and less formally in oral communications in sessions and outside. (That's the kind of complicated communicative context that liter- acy's historians have learned to appreciate.) SSHA meetings promote inter- disciplinary and international advances in criticism, collaboration, and new research that have had demonstrable effects on the theory and practice of lit- eracy studies. The emergence of literacy as an interdisciplinary field for contemporary students opens the way for a richer exchange between social science historians and other researchers for the mutual reshaping of inquiry past, present, and future that is part of the promise of social science history. Historical studies of literacy, finally, contribute to public discourse, debate, and policy "talk" inter- nationally. The many crucial points of intersection include the demonstration that no "golden age" for literacy ever existed, that there are multiple paths to literacy for individuals and societies, that quantitative measures of literacy do not translate easily to qualitative assessments, that the environment in which literacy is learned affects the usefulness of the skills, that the connections be- tween literacy and inequality are many, and that the constructs of literacy (its learning and its uses) are usually conceived far too narrowly. Social science historians of literacy need to bring their criticisms and new conclusions to audiences throughout the academy and beyond. Along with other social science historians, they need to confront the limitations of two generations of study of primarily numerical records as they continue to build on that achievement. They need to probe the nature of literacy as a histori- cal subject and variable. In part, they can do this by bridging the present gap between the history of literacy and new research on printing, publishing, and readership, on the one hand, and new perspectives in the humanities, anthro- pology, and psychology, on the other hand. Literacy studies join other social science histories in exploring new approaches to society and culture through narrative, feminist theories, literary theories, critical theory, and many other interdisciplinary connections across the human sciences in the early twenty-</page><page sequence="31">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 513 first century. For scholars wary of these interchanges, I emphasize that we undertake these encounters from our foundations as social science historians. That makes a difference. Many Literacies and Historical Literacies The identification and initial exploration of multiple or many literacies stand out among the most exciting recent discoveries about literacy. A recogni- tion that alphabetic literacy - reading and writing as we know them - is one set of abilities and orientations (however valuable) among others, with which it interacts, is beginning to reshape thinking about cognition and commu- nication.50 Enormous implications follow from placing "traditional literacy" within learning and communicative contexts that may also include such "literacies" as numeracy, oral and aural abilities, spatial literacy or graphicacy (as geographers call it), visual abilities, cyber skills, and aesthetic sensibilities, among a great many other literacies touted. Many literacies appeal broadly to researchers and teachers today for reasons that begin with the intuitive and take seriously criticisms of schools that poorly teach a narrow range of literacy skills. They find support in new research about learning. Multiple literacies appeal to historians who wish to broaden the scope of new histories to in- clude a wider realm of human abilities, modes of understanding, and means of communication. New attention to oral culture, nonverbal communications, visual expression, and numeracy mark this interest. Historians of science, for example, suggest that invention and discovery may depend more on visual than on alphabetic literacy. Notions of many literacies also carry implications for training social science historians. Social science history provides a rich laboratory and tool kit to study reading and writing among other literacies in challenging, innovative settings. From social science histories and many literacies, it is not a large leap toward a new construct that I call historical literacies. The conceptions of both literacy and history that inform the historical literacies I propose bear little relationship to the ahistorical and underconceptualized historical literacy of memorized facts that is linked to E. D. Hirsch's notion of cultural literacy.5s To the contrary, historical literacies derive from current thinking in both lit- eracy studies and historical studies, and they have a special resonance with social science histories. Social science histories may have the power to pro-</page><page sequence="32">514 Social Science History mote special modes of inquiry and understanding that derive from and build on the wide-ranging competencies and sensibilities of many literacies and the unusual advantages of histories as ways of knowing and understanding in con- text. Historical literacies embrace the pluralism and scope that are inherent in integrated concepts of social science histories and multiple literacies. An encompassing set of analytic and synthetic skills and a wide-ranging approach to inquiry join specific modes of interpretation. Together they are rooted in the qualities that only historical thinking can provide. Thinking historically is a distinct mode of thought and path of understanding made possible by the disciplining powers of historical context: time, place, complex relationships, and consequences that arise from the possibilities of the historical moment. New conceptualizations and practices of literacies and histories may trans- form approaches to history by stressing multiple paths of access, understand- ing, and expression; multiple modes of inquiry, the fundamental importance of contexts of learning and practice; and the unique power of historical context as components of comprehension in historical terms. Historical imagination is another essential part of historical literacies. Together they promote his- torical understandings that can inform our apprehension of the present and the future, as well as the past: social science histories looking backward and looking forward.52 The Next 25 Years In the Social Science History Association's first presidential address, Lee Benson forcefully stimulated certain "shocks of the new" when he enunci- ated his goal of "changing social science to change the world." To do that, he declared, SSHA must "restore the historical dimension to the scientific study of human behavior." 53 That was no small charge. Nor was it received uncritically: respondents agreed that Benson went too far. Regardless of specific criticisms, Benson's spirit still resonates. Allan Bogue (1986: 157) reiterated that spirit when he stated that SSHA's "archi- tects had a dream and ... its influence will long be felt." In 2001, the influence continues to be felt. We honor it best as we endeavor to change history and the social sciences in order to understand the world better - that is, to understand the world historically. That is the goal of social science histories and historical</page><page sequence="33">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 515 literacies. The world may, or may not, change. Fittingly for the millennium, the promise of a historically dynamic social science history remains before us. To the next 25 years!

Appendix B: Social Science History Mission Statements Objectives in the Constitution of the SSHA The major purpose of the Social Science History Association is to improve the quality of historical explanation in every manner possible, but particularly by encouraging the selec- tive use and adaptation in historical teaching and research of relevant theories and methods from related disciplines, particularly the social sciences. The Association will seek to achieve this purpose by: Developing a publication program that will encourage and disseminate social science his- tory of high quality devoted to substantive research, to methodological concerns, and to curricular development. Organizing conferences, both regional and national, to bring together like-minded histori- ans and other social scientists with interdisciplinary interests. In this respect members of the Association will endeavor to foster those research areas in which work is par- ticularly experimental or path-breaking in nature as well as those which have already attracted considerable numbers of adherents. Encouraging the introduction of the materials of the new social, political, and economic history into the undergraduate curriculum, with appropriate concern for the devel- opment of teaching methods appropriate to the new course content, at all curricular levels but particularly in college and university introductory sources and in the offer- ings of junior and community colleges. We are particularly concerned that ways be devised to carry the challenge and exhilaration of the research process into the class- room. Sponsoring or assisting in the development of summer institutes or other training programs to enable historians and other social scientists to learn skills necessary for the various types of interdisciplinary historical research and their presentation in the classroom. Fostering the retrieval and archiving of quantitative historical data for general scholarly use and its processing in data series of wide applicability as well as assisting in the dissemination of such materials for both research and classroom use.</page><page sequence="35">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 517 Enabling history and the other social sciences to respond better to the growing interest in the historical dimension in various social science disciplines by promoting the evalua- tion of historical research proposals by fund granting agencies on the basis of the substance of the research problem rather than in terms of the departmental or disci- plinary affiliation of the applicants. Working to achieve maximum freedom of access for scholars to data of particular interest to social science historians. Preparing and submitting grant proposals where appropriate to enable the executive offi- cers and council members of the Association to realize the major and subordinate objectives of the Association. Taking any other appropriate action, which the members of the Association may believe necessary to achieve the above objectives. Editors' Foreword to Social Science History, volume 1, no. 1 (fall 1976) Social Science History is the journal of the Social Science History Association. This organi- zation was formed in 1974 for the purpose of improving the quality of historical explanation by encouraging the selective use and adaptation in teaching and in research in relevant theories and methods from the social science disciplines. The Association's Organizing Committee includes scholars from a wide range of disciplines interested in developing a common enterprise within which historians seeking a more rigorous and consciously theo- retical orientation in their discipline might join forces with other social scientists interested in longitudinal analysis. Social Science History will constitute one of the most important avenues through which the Association hopes to implement its goals of encouraging sub- stantive research, fostering appropriate curricular development, and stimulating theoreti- cal, methodological, and data-gathering activities relating to these objectives. The Editors of Social Science History will encourage and provide a forum for re- search that attempts generalizations of some breadth verified by systematic examination of the relevant evidence and supported by quantitative analysis when appropriate. Research efforts involving comparisons across time between individuals and groups within a single population and between different and properly comparable populations across space and over time will be particularly welcome. We shall also welcome contributions to the develop- ment of theory and techniques which, although firmly centered in particular social science disciplines, can provide a genuine interdisciplinary focus in approaching the historical di- mension. We shall, of course, be particularly receptive to research of a path-breaking or experimental nature, but we also accord a high priority to significant research advances in the more highly developed areas of social science history. Within the general framework delineated by these guidelines, the Editors declare their interest in case studies of an inno- vative nature and in interpretive inquiries into the "state of the art." To this end, we plan to inaugurate a series of "retrospective" reviews that will attempt to assess the significance and impact of some of the major writings in the areas that share common concerns with social science history. Additionally, the Editors hope to stimulate the development of social science his-</page><page sequence="36">518 Social Science History tory courses in college and university curricula by publishing articles which aim at de- veloping teaching methods that will carry the challenge and exhilaration of the research process into the classroom. In pursuit of this goal, we shall disseminate information on cross-disciplinary or program-oriented course experiments that have innovative promise and that are judged to deserve a wide audience. Also, on a selective basis, Social Science History will inform its readers about new developments in social science data archives, research funding agencies, training programs and summer institutes, and significant new publications in the history and social science disciplines. In conclusion, the Editors affirm their total commitment to the position that system- atic contact and interchange of ideas between kindred spirits in history and in the social sciences will be immensely beneficial to all concerned. We believe that the study of social theory within an empirical historical context can make a uniquely valuable contribution to our understanding of societies, past and present, and we intend that Social Science History should be an important means by which that contribution will be transmitted throughout the scholarly community. Front Matter Description to Social Science History, volume 23, no. 3 (fall 1999) Social Science History is the journal of the Social Science History Association and exists to publish material directed to improving the quality of historical explanation in teaching and research of relevant theories and methods from the social science disciplines. It is aimed at social scientists interested in longitudinal analysis and historians seeking a more rigorous and consciously theoretical orientation. The editors encourage and provide a forum for research that attempts generalizations of some breadth verified by systematic examination of the relevant evidence and support by quantitative analysis when appropriate. Research efforts involving comparisons across time between individuals and groups within a single population and between different and properly comparable populations across space and over time will be particularly welcome. The editors welcome contributions to the develop- ment of theory and techniques that, although firmly centered in particular social science disciplines, can provide a genuine interdisciplinary focus in approaching the historical di- mension. The Social Science History Association will also inform its members about new developments in social science data archives, research funding agencies, training programs and summer institutes, and significant new publications in history and the social science disciplines through its newsletter. Notes A shorter version of this essay was delivered as the presidential address to the twenty-fifth Annual Meeting of the Social Science History Association, Pittsburgh, 28 October 2000. The author thanks Daniel Gelo, Kolleen Guy, Michael B. Katz, James McDonald, and Daniel Scott Smith for their criticisms of an earlier version of the presentation; Charles</page><page sequence="37">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 519 Thurston and Michelle Herrera for assistance with library research; and Erik Austin for SSHA historical lore and advice. 1 How best to tell my tales is one of many important issues that I cannot discuss here. Parts of many stories intersect here, including my own. Each presentation begs ques- tions of the modes of expression, from different forms of narrative (old or new style) to different forms of analysis, genre, emplotment, trope, and voice. Possible tropes, for example, include romance and comedy - to some they are a tragedy; to many others, a satire. Regardless, this story is both personal and collective, a story replete with ambiguities, indeed with contradictions. It is also a story with many lessons. See, in general, Cox and Stromquist 1998; Hexter 1971a, 1971b; LaCapra 1985; Megill 1985, 1995; Munslow 1997; Nelson et al. 1987; White 1966, 1978, 1987. 2 Questions persist over the status and achievements of social science history. Among a large, often ungainly literature, see Aydelotte 1971; Benson 1972; Berkhofer 1969; Bogue 1973, 1983, 1986, 1987; Bogue and Clubb 1977a, 1977b; Aydelotte et al. 1972; Fogel 1975, 1983; Kammen 1980; Kousser 1977, 1980, 1984, 1989; Landes and C. Tilly 1971; Lorwin and Price 1972; Reynolds 1998; Stearns 1980. See also Bender 1986; Handlin 1971, 1975,1979; Hexter 1970, 1971a, 1971b; Higham 1989; Himmelfarb 1975, 1984, 1987; Monkkonen 1986; Munslow 1997; Novick 1988; Ross 1998; Schlesinger 1962; Scott 1988, 1991; Stone 1977, 1987; Thelen 1987; Veysey 1979a, 1979b. M. J. Maynes gave some unpublished remarks on this topic at the SSHA meeting in Chi- cago, November, 1998. 3 Appleby blurs social history, quantitative history, and social science history into an amorphous social history, as do many others, including Eugene Genovese. She praises social history for raising "the consciousness of the entire discipline" about methods and data, and for adding so many ordinary people's lives to historical study. See also Charles Wetherell's (1999) incensed critique of Appleby. 4 Thanks to Dan Smith for pointing me to this comparison. The Historical Society has a very different agenda and ideals for the reform of the historical profession. See Fox-Genovese and Lasch-Quinn 1999. 5 There are many other examples, including the history of growing up, another of my interests. See Graff 1979, 1987, 1995a, 1995b. 6 Taylor refers to comments by Clifford Geertz: "Fifteen years in the life of a discipline is also a long time," Taylor (1992: xix) continued; "changes of the same magnitude have overtaken the history of urban cultures, which scarcely existed as a recognizable subspecies of history when I first began to write." 7 See, for example, the noted expressions of Schlesinger 1962; Handlin 1971, 1975, 1979; Hexter 1970, 1971a, 1971b; Hamerow 1987; Barzun 1972, 1974; and Himmelfarb 1975, 1984, 1987, among many others, more or less from a conservative side, and, avowedly from the left, Genovese and Fox-Genovese 1982 and Judt 1979. 8 I am not the only member of that class who became a professor or a historian. See Stone 1977, 1979, for an example of early enthusiasm followed by souring.</page><page sequence="38">520 Social Science History 9 My first book, The Literacy Myth: Literacy and Social Structure in the Nineteenth- Century City (1979), was published in such a series: Charles Tilly's and Edward Shorter's Studies in Social Discontinuity series, from Academic Press. 10 I attended the Newberry Library Summer Institute in Quantitative, Demographic, and Family History in 1973. See Graff 1977, 1991, 1995b. In their presidential ad- dresses, Bogue, Clubb, Flanigan, and Miller, among others, underscore the impor- tance of the ICPSR in the construction of the SSHA and social science history more generally. See also Kousser 1977, 1980, 1984, 1989. 11 I refer to the conferences that launched the SSHA itself, as well as the annual Clio- metrics meetings and the SUNY-Brockport conferences. Important for me was the "Little Community Conference" at Brandeis University in 1972, the site for my first professional paper. The invitation to participate came from graduate students who organized the conference and faculty who had read my first professional article in Historical Methods in 1971 on methods for studying literacy, based on my master's thesis. 12 For descriptions of an approach to social science history, see Graff 1991, 1995b: intro- duction; Katz 1975; Katz et al. 1982. To be sure, I am describing no utopia: I spent hundreds of hours coding quantitative data from microfilm onto 80-column IBM forms. In the University of Toronto history department, I was told that, until I had completed my comprehensive exams in no less than 2 to 3 years, I should plan to read at least one book a day in the library. On the organization of research in social science history, see also Hershberg 1981; C. Tilly 1981. 13 Dangers existed. In some "shops," supervisors' work advanced while students' was subordinated; top-down dictation could dominate over collaboration, imitation over creativity. 14 I became a U.S. and North American historian, with comparative bases in Western European and Canadian history. My interest in social theory found outlets. From my home base working with Katz, I learned a great deal from Toronto's strong and varied group of new historians: Natalie Zemon Davis, Edward Shorter, Jill Conway, and Ian Winchester. Charles Tilly recently had left Toronto for Michigan, but his influence remained. 15 From an initial examination of data from nineteenth-century Canadian manuscript censuses in the context of the new social history and social science history, literacy grew into my doctoral dissertation and a series of publications. This topic was timely in both the historical and the historicist perspectives. 16 For Canadian historiography, see, for example, the writings of Michael Bliss and Jack Granatstein. Critical responses were complicated in Canada, owing to questions about the importing of "foreign" methods from the United States and Europe. 17 The relationship of history in crisis to the phenomenon of "'new' histories" is am- biguous and contradictory but no less important for that. Histories of history reveal this tendency. Questions about politics and ideology arise--for example, questions about the relationships between "new left" historians, "new" histories, and social sci-</page><page sequence="39">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 521 ence histories -but I cannot take them up now. See Ross 1998; Higham 1989; Muns- low 1997; Novick 1988; Olabarri 1995; Scott 1988, 1991; also Appleby et al. 1994; cf. Himmelfarb 1987; Handlin 1979; Schlesinger 1962; Hamerow 1987; AHR Forum 1989; Thelen 1987. My grasp of these issues was clarified by teaching in fall 1999, in anticipation of writing this address, a graduate proseminar that I entitled "Histories Old and New." My thanks to the students. 18 Olabarri (1995) also discusses what these new histories have in common, and Ross (1998: 85) reminds us that these new histories belong to the history of the social sci- ences, as well as to history. 19 Ross (1998: 92) also states that "all three set out to remake American historiography on terms suggested by social theory; all have enriched historiography, but none has succeeded in its imperialistic ambition." C. Tilly (1981) credits the failure of "mod- ernization" approaches in social science as a factor propelling historical social science. Stearns (1980) notes its importance for some historians. 20 Here I differ with Ross. I believe that this has been true to a greater extent than she allows. The relationship of each of these histories with quantitative social science his- tory calls out for study. 21 Hobsbawm (1972a) refers to "social history" but is more concerned with what is called social science history. Stone (1977) writes about many of same topics under the rubric of "history and the social sciences." Benson originally proposed the title "Social Sci- entific History Association." Bogue (1986: 137) observed that "no one has yet offered a satisfactory descriptive label that can embrace the various brands of new history that became clearly visible during the 1960s; perhaps analytic or systematic revisionism, or eclectic empiricism fit best." The "new social history" has had a complicated his- tory with social science history and the SSHA; see, for example, Bogue (1987: 340): "Everyone there [1974 Ann Arbor conference] was fully aware of the popularity of social history but believed that there were broad elements of similarity in the ap- proaches found in all of the 'new' histories, sufficient to sustain cooperative activity." I am arguing against hard and fast distinctions between histories social scientific and histories new. I am not denying differences, some of them very significant. A more complete discussion of those relationships, while important, is not my task here. Too many discussions confuse by making and exaggerating distinctions. There are impor- tant issues in the (historical) sociology of knowledge here. 22 Reading "ruptures" is notoriously difficult. At the 1998 SSHA in Chicago, M. J. Maynes spoke movingly about some of the ways in which the profession has not changed with respect to "new histories and some of the human costs." 23 For Novick (1988), the wrecking ball swings from "a convergent culture" and "an au- tonomous profession" to "the collapse of comity," "every group its own historian," "the center does not hold," and "there was no king in Israel." On Novick's book, see Haskell 1990; Kloppenberg 1989; AHR Forum 1991. By the 1950s, the "presence of that increasingly visible minority [who thought of themselves as social scientists- among them SSHA's founders (William Aydelotte, Lee Benson, Allan Bogue, and</page><page sequence="40">522 Social Science History Warren Miller)] prompted something of a disciplinary identity crisis," in Novick's (1988: 383) view. On the one hand, "Richard Hofstadter thought that 'at a very primi- tive level' many historians heard suggestions that their activity might be enriched by the social sciences as a reproach for 'shoddy work or intellectual superficiality'"; on the other hand, "for the many historians who had always thought of themselves as humanists, the suggestion that history should not just use social science but be a social science violated their deepest sense of their identity" (Novick 1988: 385; see also Hex- ter 1970, 1971b, 1972; Handlin 1979; Himmelfarb 1987; Barzun 1974; Genovese and Fox-Genovese 1982). 24 At the ICPSR, Warren Miller and Jerry Clubb provided a launching site for a new professional organization. See also Jensen 1969. 25 I recall my first meetings with many people, including Allan Sharlin, at this event. Unlike Eric Monkkonen, I recall the museum reception in Greco-Roman ruins, not an Egyptian tomb. I don't recall it as a place "where we all felt crude and out of place" (Monkkonen Pres. Add. 1994: 162)! I was then a second-year assistant professor. I've attended all subsequent SSHA meetings. As I write, I am flooded by valued memo- ries, which include sessions on several of my books and regular reunions with many friends and acquaintances. 26 Bogue (1987: 338) continued: "It is a commonplace to say that these gatherings were far more stimulating than those of the staid old matrons of the profession, the AHA [American Historical Association] and the OAH [Organization of American Histo- rians]. That is still the case, I think." See also Bogue 1986, 1987, on aspirations, re- actions, and others. 27 Monkkonen (Pres. Add. 1994: 162) continued: "This was a period marked by small meetings - about one-third the size of this one [1993]- few members, and a sense of mutual exclusion from the professional mainstream coupled with a completely un- justified optimism." Ross (1998: 92) notes that the major new histories "set out to remake American historiography." 28 Nor was it "saved from extinction by an influx of young social historians who turned it into the vital organization." Their presence was anticipated and generally welcomed (Bogue 1987: 340). 29 As founding president, Benson worked to install networks. They were neither in the constitution nor part of planning. Although the number of networks has grown and some have ended, it was only recently discovered that SSHA has no formal provisions for changing networks! Susan Cotts Watkins focused on networks in her presidential address. 30 Ross (1998: 92) continued: for historians seeking science, the "model of science was most often the empirical, behaviorist, quantitative social science practiced in the United States." Without engaging in semantic quibbling, I think her use of"predomi- nated" begs qualification. It casts a sense of homogeneity that may mislead. In some ways, it did - it was certainly a symbol for SSHA; in other ways, it did not. This issue bears further examination.</page><page sequence="41">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 523 31 Ross offers no evidence. I am also unsure about her sense of the impact of critiques of quantification and positivism, although SSHA did change. Erik Austin, SSHA ex- ecutive director, believes that 45% to 50% of current members are historians; the others are drawn from across a range of disciplines mainly in the social sciences (per- sonal communication, January 2000); see also Bogue 1986, 1987; Higham 1989 [1965]; cf. Monkkonen Pres. Add., 1986, 1994; Hareven Pres. Add. 1998). 32 Daniel Scott Smith's noted report, "The Needs of a Mature Organization," after 12 years, in the 1989 presidential address, constitutes another sign. 33 On shorthand definitions and possible confusions, see Monkkonen Pres. Add. 34 A social science historian "begins where possible with an explicit statement of as- sumptions, concepts, and hypotheses [typically from the social sciences], and he relies on evidence that is reproducible, verifiable, and potentially refutable" (Landes and Tilly 1971: 72). 35 "The systematic, standardized analysis of similar social processes or phenomena ... in different settings in order to develop and test ideas of how those processes or phe- nomena work" (Landes and Tilly 1971: 73). 36 With respect to the new political history and the new economic and social histories, Bogue (1986: 137) emphasizes analysis over narrative, problems or themes over peri- ods, process as well as event, ordinary voters over elites, and case study emphasis: "The combination of source materials differed.... [Which] in turn suggested the use of new methods and techniques more suited to the different source data." Aydelotte (1971) had relatively little to say specifically about quantitative methods in his book with that title. Compare with Higham 1989; Ross 1998; see also Fogel 1975; Fogel and Elton 1983; Hays 1980; Kousser 1980, 1984, 1989; McDonald 1996a; L. Tilly Pres. Add. 1983; Sewell et al. 1992; Burke 1992; Rabb and Rotberg 1982; Gilbert and Grau- bard 1972; contrast with Handlin 1979; Schlesinger 1962; Barzun 1974; Himmelfarb 1987; AHR Forum 1989. 37 Conference programs offer the best guide, especially for the early years. 38 Monkkonen (1994: 4) also writes: "The motives of jumping disciplines among histo- rians differ somewhat from those in the other social sciences." See also Abbott 1991. 39 Similarly, single examples stand as the foundation for sweeping condemnations of the entire enterprise, especially Fogel and Engerman's (1974) Time on the Cross and Hershberg's (1981) Philadelphia. An especially excessive example is Windschuttle 1996. See also Evans 1997 and Himmelfarb's (1975, 1984, 1987) repetitions. These ex- amples also illustrate the confusion of modernist new histories with the alleged effects of more recent linguistic, poststructural, or postmodern "turns." 40 From a less sympathetic vantage point, John Higham (1989: 251) also describes social science history's establishment: "Quantification gained general acceptance as a legiti- mate and sometimes essential instrument for historians, but its programmatic signifi- cance diminished. As its applications became more varied, more familiar, and even conventional in historical research, the mystique it had for enthusiastic practitioners in the 1960's began to fade."</page><page sequence="42">524 Social Science History 41 Among the new currents are the following: "return to politics," "new institutional- ism," policy studies, narrative and discourse, historical geography, world systems, macrohistorical dynamics, and theory and formal methods of diverse kinds. 42 This was also noted by Monkkonen in his presidential address, 1994; Sewell 1992; Roth 1992; Baker 1999. 43 It is not coincidental that I established a working committee on the future of the SSHA during my year as president. 44 Sewell also addresses some of the problems. Neither traditional critics of social science history nor traditional supporters are pleased by this turn! 45 Both Sewell and Maynes comment on this, Maynes at some length in her presenta- tion to the 1998 SSHA meeting in Chicago. See also Baker 1999. Sewell (1992: 487) also writes: "Until social science historians can show that specific text-reading strate- gies illuminate the meanings and dynamics of social movements and social processes, the positivistically inclined may feel justified in their skepticism. An analogy may be drawn to the early days of the encounter between social science and history. Through- out the 1950s, many historians borrowed concepts from social science theory; history texts of the period abound with role expectations, relative deprivation, and status in- consistency. But it was only in the 1960s and 1970s, when historians began to adopt the concrete research practices of social scientists, that the breakthrough to a new social science history occurred. Like the historical texts of the 1950s, these texts on narrative test out a new theoretical vocabulary and the issues that it implies. But I am convinced that we cannot realize the full potential of current interdisciplinary explorations along the borders of the social sciences and humanities without follow- ing literary theorists beyond their theoretical signposts into the concrete practices of their textual analysis." See also McDonald 1996a, 1996b; Scott 1988, 1991; Sewell et al. 1992. 46 The 2000 SSHA meeting included a roundtable on "Literacy as Social Science His- tory: Its Past and Future." Chad Gaffield, David Mitch (who organized the session), Anders Nilsson, and David Vincent participated, and I chaired it. 47 Calhoun (1996: 328) continues: "But to reduce historical sociology to conventional sociology applied to past times is ... to deprive it of its main significance." 48 Calhoun (1996: 328) adds: "In order to realize its potential both within sociology and in relation to an interdisciplinary historical and theoretical discourse, however, historical sociology needs to address problems of the changing constitution of social actors, the shifting meanings of cultural categories, and the struggle over identities and ideologies. These need to be conceived as part and parcel of social relations, not separate topics of inquiry, and still less as the turf of other disciplines." 49 We have a much sharper conception, for example, of the roles of literacy in nation building, industrialization, urbanization, immigration, demographic transi- tions, shifts in demand and supply for schooling, the construction of modern differ- entiated social structures and their cultural concomitants including the emergence of</page><page sequence="43">Shock of the "'New' (Histories)" 525 class and mass culture, the spread of social institutions and their impact on lives, the maintenance of social order, and efforts to control disorder. Disciplinary differences sometimes divide literacy's students; these include con- ceptual and theoretical interests, overarching questions, preferred methods, styles of analysis, and aspirations for research contributions. Economic historans, for example, are usually more interested in aggregate data, aggregative analysis, and relationships on a macro level so they may examine productivity, sector shifts, or labor force at- tributes. Social historians typically focus on individual-level records (reaggregated in the middle range) and micro-level analysis to examine immigration, mobility, work, education, or family, often by gender, class, race, and ethnicity. Demographic histo- rians go both ways - for example, in tracking literacy's impact on fertility decline or migration. We learn from the common and the contrasting ground of disciplines. 50 Explicating this is the task for another occasion. In the meantime, see Graff 1993, 1999a, 1999b, and 1999c and works cited therein. Among those who influence my ap- proach to literacy and learning are Daniel Calhoun, Howard Gardner, Barbara Rogoff, Jean Lave, Robert Sternberg, Michael Cole, Shirley Scribner, Shirley Brice Heath, David Barton, and their colleagues. There are dangers here, including the prolifera- tion of too many literacies and the attendant trivialization of the concept. 51 Historical literacy is never defined by Gagnon and the Bradley Commission (1989). On Hirsch, see Graff 1989, 1995b, 1999a, 1999b; Stearns 1991, 1993. 52 For elaboration of at least some of the issues touched on here, see also Graff 1999a, 1999b; Calhoun 1995, 1996, 1998; C. Tilly 1981; Katz 1987, 1995; Hobsbawm 1972a, 1972b, 1981, 1993. My thinking about historical literacies is still preliminary. "Look- ing backward and looking forward" was the theme for the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting of the SSHA. 53 Benson (Pres. Add. 1977:439-40) continued: "SSHA's particular advantage, Ibelieve, is that it was consciously organized to restore the historical dimension to the scien- tific study of human behavior. Suppose we assume, as I do, that an ahistorical social science is a contradiction in terms, i.e., good social theory cannot be ahistorical. It then follows that SSHA can potentially play a significant role in the complex process of overcoming alienation in the American system of social science."
