<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYSTICAL AND MAGICAL CONTEMPLATION THE KABBALISTS IN SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SAFED The purpose of this article is to describe the varieties in the techniques and practice of meditation and contemplation as exemplified by one apparently homogeneous and narrowly circumscribed group. Certain basic patterns and problems are bound to turn up in every mystical religiosity, whatever the individual variations and peculiarities due to the particular theological and cultural background of the mystics concerned. Each tradition evolves its own theological, philosophical, and psychological terminology to cope with its mystical problems (e.g., technique versus grace, natural-supernatural-preternatural, etc.), and one man's meat may often turn out to be another man's poison, as is shown by the attitude of Roman Catholic theology to the Hesychast mysticism of the Eastern Church. But profound phe- nomenological differences are often hidden even within what appears to be a single, well-defined movement. The example analyzed here concerns the remarkable community of saints that lived in Safed in Upper Galilee in the sixteenth century1 and which brought about the 1 A popular and still eminently readable account of the community was given by Solomon Schechter in his beautiful essay, "Safed in the 16th Century," in Studies in Judaism (2d ser., 1908), pp. 203-6. 9 R.

The student of comparative religion will soon notice the analogies with other mystical traditions, though this article will not pursue such analogies but limit itself to an analysis of some of the mystical ideals, values, techniques, and experiences cultivated by the Safed kabbalists. In order to arrive at a fuller understanding of Safed mysticism it would, of course, be necessary to survey the various modes of revela- tion, mystical illumination, and ecstatic rapture that were known to earlier Jewish semignostic and kabbalistic traditions. For the present, it must suffice to note the selection which later kabbalistic literature seems to have operated and the transformations to which it subjected certain older practices and traditions. Thus the prekabbalistic, ecstatic technique of the soul's journey or ascent to the vision of the Throne of Glory2 fell into desuetude, though as we shall see a transformed version of it was incorporated in some later systems of meditation. Similarly, Abraham Abulafia's method of inducing the "prophetic" or illuminate state by a technique of permutation and combination of Hebrew letters3 (i.e., Divine Names) was not adopted by the dominant kab- balistic schools, though it seems to have been practiced in some esoteric circles and to have made something of a major comeback in the sixteenth century. For not only is the Abulafian type of light ex- perience and the even more suggestive "prophetic" ecstasy, defined by the kabbalists themselves as the mystic's encounter with his own self,4 known to Moses Cordovero and Hayim Vital, but many other six- teenth-century ascetic manuals are heavily indebted to Abulafia's writings.6 Of particular interest in this connection are Albottini's Ladder of Ascent6 and the unprinted fourth chapter of Vital's Gates of Holiness.7 In fact, Vital's technique of yihudim (to be discussed below) is simply the modified and transformed successor of Abulafia's per- mutations. One useful way of classifying ecstatic experiences is the famous dis- 2 On the whole subject see G.

The distinction is somewhat similar to, though not identical with, Rudolf Otto's analysis of mysticism versus theosophy or Heilsinterese versus Wissen- schaft.8 Often the mystical or visionary experience is sought for its own sake as the highest possible spiritual fulfilment. There are spirits, however, for whom it is merely a means for increasing esoteric knowl- edge; the emphasis remains on knowledge, though it is undoubtedly a saving gnosis that is sought. According to this typology, it may be said that the kabbalists seem to have found the communication-type of mystical experience more congenial. This may be in keeping with the general character of Kabbalah as a system of theosophical doctrine.9 Professor Scholem has contended with some force that, under the cover of the bewildering and often bizarre theosophical speculations of the kabbalists, there hides a genuinely mystical life.10 The fact re- mains, nevertheless, that the discursive and even dialectical elements are so prominent in kabbalistic literature that we may almost speak of an intellectualistic hypertrophy. It often looks as if the sole differ- ence between talmudic and kabbalistic literature resides in the dif- ferent subject matter. As far as form and approach are concerned, both are equally dialectical and argumentative, and more often than not kabbalistic literature is less the record of a cognitio experimentalis dei than the substitution of a theosophical pilpul for the halakhic one of the rabbis. This tendency of kabbalistic literature is borne out by the char- acter of the mystical experience reported in it. Already the beginnings of Kabbalah are associated with apparitions of the prophet Elijah, that is, with the teachings communicated by him." Elijah, as is well known, has had a most checkered career in folklore, apocalypse, and rabbinic and mystical literature. Immortal prophet, precursor of the Messiah, "Angel of the Covenant" and guardian-witness at every cir- cumcision ceremony, unexpected savior in moments of need and danger, deux ex machina, and celestial teacher and messenger, he had acquired the kind of ubiquity and character of mediator that fitted him for the role of mystical instructor. There are some striking re- 8 See R. Otto, Mysticism East and West, chap. ii. 9 MTJM, pp. 11-12, 206. 10 Ibid., pp. 15-16. Cf. Scholem, Reshith ha-Kabbalah (1938), p. 16. 11</page><page sequence="4">Mystical and Magical Contemplation semblances to the Hidr of Muslim legend.'2 But the rabbinic tradition of Elijah as the ultimate provider of answers and solutions to all out- standing legal doubts and problems, and as the messenger of the Celestial Academy, determined his function for the kabbalists. His "revelation," namely, apparition (gilluy), was considered as one of the superior forms of celestial communication. The Jewish mystic did not, as a rule, aspire to an anticipation of the blessed vision in this life but rather to authoritative indoctrination by the angel-man Elijah, the Hermes of the kabbalists. Luria, Cordovero, David ibn Zimra, and many other sixteenth-century kabbalists were reported to have held intercourse with him. Another, though less exalted, source of information was the dream. There is no need here to discuss the role of dreams in biblical and rabbinic literature.l3 Generally speaking, dreams were supposed throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages to possess a prophetic, though perhaps only faintly prophetic, character. According to the Talmud, "a dream is one sixtieth part of prophecy"; according to a hadith-saying ascribed to Muhammed, it is one forty-eighth part of prophecy. Of course dreams are infinitely varied in character and type; as varied, in fact, as mystical experience itself. Consequently, all known forms and kinds of mystical experience could be doubled on the dream level. Thus there are "sleeping" visions and auditions, and the appearance of Elijah, angels, or departed souls in dreams. As m the case of apparitions of Elijah, the revelatory function of dreams is not necessarily mystical or divinatory but may be purely halakhic (i.e., legal). Considerable importance was attached to dreams by the German Hasidim,14 and their influence can be detected in some of the great Tosafist scholars. Thus Eliezer ben Nathan (twelfth century) fasted for two days after being told in a dream that in a halakh decision he had wrongly permitted something he should have pro- hibited.15 Rabbi Judah the Pious himself tells how a dream had caused Rabbi Ephraim of Regensburg to reverse a ritual decision.16 Moses of Coucy, the famous preacher, was prompted by a dream (cinyan mar3 12 Cf., e.g., the Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam, s.v. "Ilyas" (p. 164b) and "al- Khadir" (pp. 232 ff.); also the chapters by Stiassny and Massignon in the volume Elie le prophete ("Etudes Carmelitaines," Vol. XXXV [1956]). 13 The most recent discussion of dreams in the Bible is E.

Other instances are reported in Azulay's bio- graphical dictionary. The best-known specimen of this kind of dream instruction from heaven is the little booklet, Responsa from Heaven, by Jacob the Pious of Marv6ge (twelfth century).19 Rabbi Jacob's "dream questions" con- cerned very definite points of rabbinic law. The "responsa from heaven," though cryptic and often obscure, were nevertheless usually capable of a satisfactory interpretation. Significantly enough, the one question that remained unanswered was a non-halakhic query about the date of the advent of the Messiah. These legal oracles were a source of considerable headache to later halakhists, since, according to rabbinic tradition, supernatural inter- ventions have no halakhic authority.20 Neither dreams nor the prophet Elijah can contest, let alone override, the reasoned opinion of a competent scholar. On controversial issues the majority opinion had to be followed-a rule to which, according to a charming legend,21 even God himself submitted with good grace, notwithstanding a previous intervention by bath kol or "heavenly voice" in favor of the minority view. Even as the Tosafists and other writers were at pains to explain why, in spite of all, the Talmud occasionally seems to allow for a bath kol,22 so later authorities had difficulties with the afore-mentioned examples from the lives of the hasidic scholars of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The main purpose of this halakhic antisuper- naturalism was, of course, the safeguarding of the institutionalized rabbinic procedures for interpreting the law against the dangers of charismatic anarchy. Consequently, the problem was less serious where dreams or other celestial communications concerned non- halakhic matters, such as moral exhortations, ascetic rules, and counsels of perfection, or when they foretold the future and conveyed other sundry information. The great value attached by the German Hasidim and later kab- 17 Ibid., pp. 388-89; also p. 385. 18 Ad BT Baba Qamma i (at the beginning). 19 Cf. Scholem, MTJM, p. 103.

Vital's autobiog- raphy23 is practically a dream diary, and his contemporary, Cordo- vero's disciple Elijah de Vidas, drives home his great exhortation to repent before it is too late by telling, as a matter of course, what a departed soul had revealed to him in a dream about the sufferings of hell.24 Unlike the direct vision of the harrowings of hell as reported, for example, by St. Bridget of Sweden and others, the similar accounts contained in Jewish moralist writing are usually given not by specta- tors but by the departed souls themselves.25 One of the most highly prized experiences of revelation among kabbalists was the appear- ance in a dream of the souls of departed saints. These "souls of the righteous" were, like angels, a source of supernatural information. Another method for obtaining supernatural knowledge, to be de- scribed later, was the inducing of unreflected intuitions. Curiously enough, angels were of comparatively little importance in later Kabbalah as messengers of celestial wisdom.26 Although in earlier periods angels acted more frequently as revealers of mysteries (and examples are not lacking in Jewish literature from the 0. T. Apocrypha, the Merkabah writings, and earlier kabbalistic pseudepig- rapha down to later kabbalism), yet for most kabbalists the role of angels was usually restricted to the more "practical" or magical side of their endeavors. The angelic transmission of heavenly wisdom was monopolized, to a large extent, by the prophet Elijah, and in the sixteenth century the establishing of contact with the soul of the de- parted righteous rather than with angels became a major feature of Lurianic practice. The desired rapport or contact was established by visiting their tombs and by the use of appropriate scriptural verses or formulas constituting "Divine Names" (yihudim). Vital's Book of Yihudim sets forth the theory and practice of this method in full detail. As the Book of Yihudim and the Gates of Holiness (particularly its 23 Printed frequently under the title Shibhey Rabbi Hayyim Vital. A complete edition, based on Vital's autograph, appeared in Jerusalem in 1954 under the correct title Sefer ha-Hizyonoth. 24 Reshith Hokhmah (ed. Warsaw [1875], p. 59). 25 The most recent example of this type of communication is the little booklet Spirits Are Telling by the kabbalist Rabbi Yehudah Moses Petayah of Baghdad (1st ed. [in Minhath Yehudah]; Baghdad, 1936; 2d ed.; Jerusalem, 1954). 26 Although in the case of R. Jacob the Pious of Marvege the replies were con- veyed by an angel, this is not typical of later kabbalistic experience, though, of course, it did occur not infrequently. The manuscript work "ha-Mal'akh 'ha- Meshib" (Jerusalem: Jewish National and University Library, Hebr. 8?, 147, and B.M.'Add. 27,002 [Margoliouth 766]) does not introduce an angel as vox coelestis, since it is really God himself who speaks to the mystic; cf. Scholem, Kitvey Yad be- Kabbalah, 1930, pp. 85-89. 14</page><page sequence="7">unpublished fourth part) amply show, these mystical experiences or revelations could be induced by the appropriate techniques. Many kabbalistic books, and indeed also non-kabbalistic writings in contact with the esoteric tradition, recommended or "revealed" such tech- niques which usually consisted of combinations of Hebrew letters, that is, Divine Names. The interesting manuscript work known as The Answering Angel,27 with its parallel revelations of theoretical and practical Kabbalah (kabbalah iyyunith-kabbalah macasith), is full of instructions of this kind; one of its most remarkable features is its interest in automatic writing as a channel of revelation.2 As a matter of fact, the semimagical practice of asking dream questions also pre- supposes the existence of well-defined techniques of "compelling" the dream and the answer. For, strictly speaking, the traditional term "dream question" (sheDelath halom) is misleading; the desideratum was a "dream answer" to a waking question. The question was accom- panied by the proper formulas which were then supposed to become effective during sleep. The popularity of the method is borne out by the fact that we possess literally "hundreds of recipes"29 for it. One such recipe, chosen at random,30 may illustrate the procedure gen- erally: Dream question: write this [Divine] Name on [a piece of] parchment, put it under your head and thus address the Angel of Dreams: "I adjure you with the great, mighty and awesome Name [of God] that you visit me this night and answer my question and request, whether by dream, by vision, by [indicating] a verse from Scripture, by speech ... or by [showing me some] writing, in a manner that I should not forget but remember [on waking up] my question and request [together with the answer]. Amen, Selah." And this is the Name: One point that emerges clearly enough from our cursory treatment of dreams and yihudim should be stressed here, although it will be taken up again at a later stage. It is a feature that stands in marked contrast to the basic notions of the mystical theology of the church. The kabbalistic methods are frankly magical in the sense that they assume "scientific," albeit esoteric, causal laws regulating our connec- tions with the "higher" spheres. These causal connections can be exploited by the seeker of information and by the mystic who is, in the last resort, also a seeker of information, albeit higher and mystical gnosis. The manipulation of the hidden, spiritual "me- 27 See previous note. 28 MS., B.M. fols. 108a ff. 29 Scholem, MTJM, p. 103. 30 From a collection of magic texts in a Bodleian MS (Opp. 447 [Neubauer, 1833], fol. 164b). 15</page><page sequence="8">Mystical and Magical Contemplation chanics" leaves little or no room for the free and unpredictable opera- tions of Grace. It may be readily admitted that yihudim, etc., are not quite the same as conjuring up a spirit or jinn. Very often their ulti- mate purpose is a genuinely mystical one. Yet they are also funda- mentally different from the techniques of mere spiritual preparation, designed to make the soul worthy of receiving the mysteries.3' Of course, the element of preparation is present too to some extent, but in the last resort repentance, observance of the law, ascetic piety, and mortifications are merely initial steps to be supplemented by further and more crucial techniques. There is an undoubted tendency to con- ceive of the efficacy of these kabbalistic techniques as necessary and near automatic. It is very probable that this "magical" approach to mysticism is due, at least partly, to the medieval, neoplatonic conception of an automatic ascent of the soul to higher, purer, and more divine spheres as it purges itself of matter and of the passions. As is well known, these ideas profoundly influenced medieval Jewish theology and its conception of prophecy. Prophecy was thought of less as a divine charisma, freely and graciously dispensed, than as the necessary and almost inevitable results of the right bios theoretikos. The proper con- templative (intellectual-moral) attitude of necessity culminates in the contact or communion of the human intellect with the divine "active intellect." Prophecy is thus simply the maximum realization of the "acquired intellect." It is instructive in this respect to compare Maimonides' theory of prophecy32 or even that of Yhudah Halevi's Kuzari with Thomas Aquinas.33 Medieval Jewish philosophy, domi- nated by Maimonides, tended to efface the distinction between prophecy and the contemplative life of mystical devekuth. On the one hand, prophecy became the ideal but legitimate aim of all spiritual life; on the other hand, it lost its original characteristics of specific contents and message and became a mystical "state." What seems essential and basic to the phenomenology of biblical prophecy appears as an extraneous adjunct in the scheme of Maimonides. Whereas for Aquinas the mystical life, whether in terms of anticipation of future bliss or as intuitive apprehension of the mysteries of faith, is one thing and the social charisma of prophecy, with its well-defined message and contents, is quite another, the two are assimilated in Jewish 31 Cf. the various contributions to the volume Technique et contemplation ("Etudes Carmelitaines"), 1949. 32 Guide of the Perplexed (English trans. M. Friedlander), pp. 219-20, 384-85, and Code, Yesodey ha-Torah, Vol. VII. 3 Summa Theol. 2a, 2ae, 171:1, 2; 172:1-4. 16</page><page sequence="9">thought. Obviously, this assimilation cuts both ways. Not only is prophecy henceforth interpreted in terms of mysticism, but also mysticism, far from remaining an emotional state of bliss or union, becomes a matter of knowable, intelligible contents. When these contents leave the realm of philosophical generalizations, abstracts, "pure forms," or other spiritual realities to be prehended by immediate philosophico-mystical contemplation, and become pieces of specific, albeit "mystical," information to which discursive logic is applicable, then the metamorphosis of prophecy in terms of mystical theosophy is complete. That this seems to have happened in kabbalism will be- come clearer as we proceed. At this stage it is sufficient to emphasize that for the medieval, platonizing, Aristotelians prophecy and inspira- tion, though not strictu sensu charismatic, were certainly not magical. They were merely "natural" in terms of the laws governing the rela- tion of our humanity with that supramundane sphere which others prefer to call "supernatural." It was the transformation of the philo- sophic traditions in the climate of late medieval kabbalistic mysticism which gave them that magical character which emerges fully and, as it were, idealtypisch in the writings of the sixteenth-century kabbalistic contemplatives. In this connection certain ideas about the apparition of the prophet Elijah assume a novel significance. For, whether by accident or design, it seems that the meeting with Elijah was considered, in the main, as an unpredictable charismatic experience. Elijah, it appears, rather like the wind which bloweth whither it listeth, was not amenable to any mystico-magical coercion. To be visited by him, though only in a dream, was a privilege for which a pious ascetic might wait in vain and no techniques are recorded for procuring his presence. One method of inducing inspirations, less magical in character and of considerable psychological interest, has already been alluded to. It is a peculiar technique of spontaneously producing discursive, intel- lectual, even highly specialized, theoretical and speculative material without any conscious effort or thought. It may perhaps be described as induced intuition or "automatic thinking." As a waking alternative to indoctrination in dreams, it is reminiscent of the technique of "active imagination" cultivated in Jungian analytical psychology as a supplement to or substitute for dreams. The underlying theory obviously assumes that whatever suddenly "falls" into consciousness is of supernatural origin. The use of the Hebrew verb nfl is a beautiful parallel to the suggestive German Einfall.34 The practical problem was 34 For a similar use of nfl in the writings of the Hasidic leader R. Dov Baer of Mezrich, who also advances a mystico-psychological theory on the nature of the 17</page><page sequence="10">Mystical and Magical Contemplation how to achieve that vacuity of mind in which alone unobstructed intuition became possible. The method adopted by Moses Cordovero and his teacher and brother-in-law Solomon Alkabets consisted of peregrinations through the Galilean countryside around Safed, and fervent prayers at the numerous tombs of Tannaim and Amoraim in the vicinity. These wanderings were not inspired by romantic notions of communing with nature; they were conceived as symbolic imita- tions of and participation in the "exile of Shekhinah" (i.e., of the divine aspect of sefirah conceived under this female symbol). Hence the opening words of Cordovero's record book of these mystical "exile wanderings" (literally "banishments") or gerushin: On Friday, the 10th of Shebat in the year 5308 [= 1548 C.E.] we went into the exile of the King and Queen as far as the ruins of the Beth ha-Midrash in Nabartin and there I hit upon the following novel kabbalistic idea: for I asked how it was possible [since the sefiroth] TifDereth and Malkhuth [i.e., the "King" and the "Queen"] draw their life from the sides of [the sefiroth] Hesed and Geburah ...." and for the rest we get a highly technical discussion of kabbalistic doc- trinal niceties. Participation in the fate of the divine Shekhinah was apparently very close to the heart of Alkabets as is shown by another entry: We went as far as Kefar Biryah where we entered the Synagogue and de- voted ourselves to matters appropriate to gerushin; and my master [Alkabets] decided upon the innovation that in the summer months especially we should on occasion walk barefooted in the mystery of the Shekhinah "withhold thy foot from being unshod."35 This same ascetic discipline of "the imitation of the Shekhinah" seems to be hinted at elsewhere by Cordovero when he explains how to train oneself in the practice of [the divine aspect of] Malkhuth .. [one] way is expounded in the Zohar and it is of great importance. One should wander, as if exiled, from place to place, purely for the sake of Heaven, and thereby make oneself a vessel [lit. merkabah, "chariot"] for the Shekhinah in exile.... Thus one should humble one's heart and bind it to the Torah even as Rabbi Simon [bar Yohai, the hero of the Zohar] and his associates used to wander about and discuss Torah. And if one trudges on foot from place to place, without horse or cart, so much the better....36 intuitive Einfall, cf. Scholem's article on Qadmuth ha-Sekhel in Haguth (Hugo Bergmann Jubilee Volume [Jerusalem, 1944]), and S. Hurwitz, "Archetypische Motive in der Chassidischen Mystik," in Zeitlose Dokumente der Seele ("Studien aus dem C. G. Jung Institut" [Zurich, 1952]). The use of nfl is not due to the influence of German-Yiddish, since it is already found in talmudic texts (e.g., Berakhoth 55b). 36 The reference is to Jer. 2:25. Going barefoot is a sign of mourning; the pur- pose of the pious exercise was clearly to hasten the advent of redemption and com- fort for the suffering Shekhinah by sharing her exile and pain consciously and intensely. 86 Cordovero, Tomer Deborah, chap. ix. 18</page><page sequence="11">In this practice of gerushin we have a good example of one of the most important innovations of Safed spirituality: the parallelism or near identification of individual ascetic-mystical life and the fate of the Godhead, in its female aspect of Shekhinah, "in exile." The parallelism has not yet become complete identity, but there is a clear correspond- ence between the mystic's efforts at participating in the suffering and redemption of the Shekhinah, on the one hand, and at rising himself on the scala mentis ad Deum to the state of prophecy or communion, on the other. This correlation comes out very clearly in an important passage in the popular ascetic manual, "The Beginning of Wisdom" (Reshith Hokhmah), by Cordovero's disciple Elijah de Vidas. There37 the mystical ideal of devekuth, or communion, is defined as "cleaving with one's soul and having as one's sole aim the unification of the Shekhinah and the separation from her of all qelipoth ['shells' or evil, demonic powers] and similarly the separation from one's own mind of all alien [i.e., sinful or worldly] thoughts." The mystic's way toward communion with God thus becomes the human aspect of his theurgic effort to bring about the inner-divine union or yihud. But, whereas this idea is, by itself, a commonplace of earlier kabbalism, it receives an added and novel significance in the parallelism and correlation of the divine Shekhinah surrounded by qelipoth, on the one hand, and the mystic's mind beset by "impure thoughts," on the other. Here the way is opened for the later development of complete identification of the objective, metaphysical evil of the qelipoth with the psychological concept of "impure thoughts." However, in spite of the eschatological concern with the fate of the Shekhinah, the manifest aim of the gerushin-peregrinations was intel- lectual enlightenment in the form of kabbalistic comments on single verses from Scripture. The proceedings were the normal, dialectical ones of the rabbinic academy ("I objected-I replied"), and the intuition must therefore have consisted of (a) the spontaneity with which a particular verse occurred to the wandering kabbalist and (b) the unreflected immediacy of questions and answers. One or two ex- amples may suffice to illustrate both the proceedings themselves and the emotions which they aroused in the participants: Again, we wandered on the 15th day of Shebat, my master and myself alone, and the words of Torah were shining in us and the words were spoken of themselves.38 We went as far as the tomb of Rabbi Joseph of Yokart and on our return we discussed the verse [Micah 7:15] "According to the days of thy 37 Op. cit., p. 51a. 38 This brings the experience very close to the phenomenon of automatic speech known as "maggidism." 19</page><page sequence="12">Mystical and Magical Contemplation coming out of the land of Egypt will 1 show him." For my master asked ... and replied.... Thereupon I commented ... and my master added to-this by saying . . . enlarging very much on the subject because the words were shining forth of themselves. So far the proceedings of that day. Thanks be to God that we were vouch- safed all this, for these things are all supernal, infused without reflection whatso- ever: they are sweeter than honey, the gift of the Queen39 to them that wander with her in exile. We were still in the study of Rabbi Simon bar Yokhai in Meron when I concluded my exposition of this subject. Then we fell down [in prayer] in the sepulchre of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Eleazar, and with my lips still moving 1 said a short prayer from the depths of my heart. Then my master arose and expounded Deuteronomy 25:17-19 in a manner different from his previous explanations, and so did some other participants. Elsewhere,40 Cordovero speaks of what I and others have experienced in connection with gerushin, when we wandered in the fields with the kabbalist Rabbi Somomon Alkabets, discussing verses from the Bible suddenly, without previous reflection. On these occa- sions new ideas would come to us in a manner that cannot be believed unless one has seen or experienced it many times. The gifts which I received and which fell to my part during these gerushin by God's mercy upon me, I shall set down in a special tract.4' Here we have a phenomenon very close to the kind of speech autom- atism known as "maggidism." No doubt we must not classify it as automatic speech in the sense of a completely autonomous, compul- sory, or obsessional activation of the organs of speech. It is probably more correct to describe the experience cultivated in this group as automatic, that is, uncontrolled thinking with the conscious control over the speech organs suspended so that the stream of ideas im- mediately translated itself into speech.42 It is a tribute to the effective- ness of rabbinic mental discipline and to its power to penetrate the more unconscious levels of psychical activity that these kabbalist rabbis always produced from their subconscious perfectly coherent, intelligible, and scholarly disquisitions. Before turning to other types of illumination or celestial instruc- tion, we may establish one preliminary result of considerable psycho- logical interest. As the foregoing examples have shown, kabbalism is 39 I.e., the divine Shekhinah. 40 ?Or Necerab (Venice, 1587), pp. 32b-33a. 41 I.e., the Sefer ha-Gerushin (Venice, 1543) from which the quotations have been taken. 42 Maggidism as fully automatic speech in a manner reminiscent of mediumistic phenomena was also well known to the Safed kabbalists. The phenomenon is dealt with by Cordovero, Vital, and others; the best-known case was that of R. Joseph Karo who kept a mystical diary in which he entered the maggidic communications. 20</page><page sequence="13">not content with guarding, explaining, and transmitting the "Kab- balah," that is, the esoteric part of the Mosaic or even pre-Mosaic tradition which kabbalists considered as a kind of mystico-theo- sophical depositum fidei. On their own premises the kabbalists could have proceeded much like the halakhists, dialectically developing their teachings from given "data," that is, canonical texts. Instead, they appear to thirst for "new" knowledge, for the revelation of "mysteries the like have never been heard before" and for "great and mighty secrets of Torah whereat all who hear them will marvel." The logical fact that by definition all Kabbalah must be of hoary antiquity and that consequently even the most startling revelations can of necessity only be the revival, in a wider circle, of the forgotten esoteric knowledge of earlier sages, prophets, and patriarchs does not affect the psychological atmosphere of our texts. Christian and Sufi mystics lived, as a rule, on transhistorical (or suprahistorical) levels; their feelings would be of elation or of gratitude for being vouchsafed glimpses of celestial mysteries. The feeling of the kabbalists was that they were living at a turning point of history, marked by the revela- tion of the last secrets of divine wisdom. If this feeling was already strong among the first kabbalists, it was much intensified by the eschatological mood that characterized kabbalism after the expulsion from Spain.43 In fact, the revelation and spread of kabbalistic doc- trines were regarded as essential features of the fulfilment of time and of the process of historic growth toward the messianic era. The experi- ence of the kabbalists was not merely one of individual salvation through gnosis, but definitely that of a kairos. Isaac Delattes of Mantua clearly expresses this conviction and mood in his approbation permitting-or rather justifying-the printing of the Zohar. The sixteenth century was a period of intense spiritual and psycho- logical stress and strain.44 As happens more frequently in the history of mysticism, such periods know no dearth of demoniacal possessions, trances, and other phenomena of enthusiasm "more interesting to the pathologist than to the theologian."45 A particularly instructive ex- ample of how powerfully the most debased forms of "mysticism" and popular superstition affected even leading kabbalists is provided by Vital himself, whose autobiographical Book of Visions abounds with reports of visits to soothsayers, palmists, and oil-readers. Possessions, we gather, were not in the least unusual, and the normal procedure in such cases was to call in mekhashfim or "sorcerers." Yet, however inter- 43 Scholem, MTJM, pp. 244 ff. 44 Ibid. 46 Schechter, op. cit., p. 247. 21</page><page sequence="14">Mystical and Magical Contemplation esting and instructive these phenomena may be to the historian and sociologist, to the student of mysticism they only represent the fringe of what was, at the core, a major upsurge of genuinely mystical life. The kabbalists of the period, particularly those in Safed, earnestly and devotedly sought the immediate presence of God: devekuth. For them, as for M. H. Luzatto in the eighteenth century, the mystical ladder led via the moral and ascetic virtues to the gift of the Holy Spirit; for that reason the so-called "Boraitha of Rabbi Pinhas ben YaDir"46 was a favorite text with all moralists and contemplatives: The knowledge of Torah leads to watchfulness, watchfulness to zeal, zeal to abstinence, abstinence to purity, purity to saintliness, saintliness to humil- ity, humility to the fear of sin, the fear of sin to holiness, and holiness leads to the gift of the Holy Spirit. Penitence, strict observance of the law, and moral and spiritual perfection, though undoubtedly efficacious in hastening the advent of redemption, were mere preliminaries which "man should do and live by them";47 but the life intended here was the vita contemplativa of communion with God (devekuth) which, in sixteenth-century Safed, acquired an almost erotic quality reminiscent of many ways of Sufi piety. The words of Maimonides48 on the love of God: And what is the proper love? That one love God with a great, excessive and mighty love until one's soul becomes permanently bound in the love of God like one who is sick of love and cannot distract his mind from the beloved woman but always thinks of her-when lying down or rising up, when eating or drinking. Even greater than that should be the love of God in the hearts of his lovers, meditating constantly upon him as He has commanded us [Deut. 46 Cf. BT cAbodah Zarah 20b and parallels. 47 For the various rules drawn up by Cordovero, Galanto and others, either for private use or that of the devout brotherhoods, see Schechter, op. cit., pp. 299-301. 48 Code, Theshubah x. 3; cf. also ibid. x. 10 and Rabed's somewhat sober gloss ad loc. Maimonides' formulation is remarkable both for its erotic simile in describ- ing the proper love of God and for the explicit statement that the Song of Songs was to be understood as an allegory of the relations between the soul and God. According to scholarly opinion, the understanding of Canticles as a philosophical allegory of the soul's love of God was first launched by Maimonides in Jewish literature (cf. S. Salfeld, "Das Hohelied bei den jiid. Erklarern des Mittelalters," Magazin f. d. Wissenschaft des Judentums, V-VI [1878/79], esp. VI, 23-38; and A. S. Halkin, "Ibn Aknin's Commentary on the Song of Songs," Alexander Marx Jubilee Volume [1950], pp. 389 ff., and esp. pp. 396-98). The view that the inter- pretation of Canticles as a dialogue between God and the soul, fairly common among Christian authors since Bernard of Clairvaux, established itself in Judaism only in sixteenth-century Safed (cf. Scholem, MTJM, p. 226), may need re-exami- nation for more than one reason. Maimonides may well be dependent on Jewish sources which used Canticles as the nearest equivalent to the mystical love lyrics of the Sufis, though such sources are still unknown. Elsewhere, Maimonides' lan- guage is more restrained (cf. Sefer ha-Miqvoth, Third Commandment as well as his Code, Yesodey ha-Torah ii. 2). On Canticles as an allegory of the soul's communion with God, see also Guide iii. 51. 22</page><page sequence="15">6:5, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God] with all thine heart and with all thy soul." This is what Solomon meant when he said allegorically [Cant. 2:5] "for I am sick of love" and the whole Song of Songs is an allegory on this subject- or the injunctions of Bahya ibn Pakuda,49 "[the lover of God] will not sleep but on the couch of His love, and will not wake up but with the sweetness of His remembrance," were taken up and lived out with an emotional intensity that was enhanced by the corporate life of the kabbalistic brotherhoods. Eliezer Azikri in his ascetic manual50 accepts all the consequences of violent love: sleeplessness ("and one should muster the strength of a lion after midnight51 and arise and give praise to Him, practise solitude and enjoy His love"), calling God fond names, and singing to the Beloved: "it is the custom of passionate lovers to sing, and since the love of our Creator is 'wonderful, passing the love of women' [cf. II Sam. 1:26], therefore he who loves Him with all his heart should sing before Him." It is true that the love lyrics of the Safed mystics fall short of the literary perfection of Yehuda Halevi and Moses ibn Ezra whom they tried to emulate, but they prove at least that the urge to sing was too powerful to be contained: "One of the most important expressions of the flame of passion is that the lover should sing songs of love before Him. Therefore I shall place be- fore you some of the love songs that we sang with great joy in the brotherhood of Hearkening Companions [cf. Cant. 8:13]." The best- known and, in Schechter's phrase, most "vividly erotic" of these mystic bards was Israel Nagara, whose hymns have found their way into many a prayer book. As has been remarked earlier, the two supreme aims of these mystics were the exaltation and redemption of the exiled Shekhinah, and the immediate "cleaving to" or presence of God-"without any partition whatsoever." Devekuth was possible because of the powerful awareness that the mystic's heart was God's true dwelling. This idea is, of course, more at home among Sufis than among theosophical kabbalists, and it is quite obvious that those among the Safed authors who use this kind of language draw heavily upon such writings of earlier kabbalists as had, in fact, absorbed Sufi influence. But the deceptively simple idea 49 "On the Service of God," The Book of the Duties of the Heart, chap. v. S0 Sefer Haredim (Venice, 1601). 51 The sudden development of tikkun hasoth (the "midnight devotion") is an- other example of the combination of purely mystical (the lonely dialogue of the soul with the divine Beloved) and kabbalistic-theurgic (sharing and influencing the fate of the Shekhinah) motives so typical of Safed. On tikkun hasoth in general cf. Scholem, Zur Kabbala und ihrer Symbolik (1960), pp. 194-99. For the earlier, purely mystical, practice of midnight meditation see, e.g., Bahya, op. cit., "On the Love of God," chap. vi. 23</page><page sequence="16">Mystical and Magical Contemplation of the heart as God's dwelling is enormously complicated once it is integrated in the context of kabbalistic theories on the relation of the divine sefiroth-macrocosm to the human microcosm. Often it is difficult not to get confused by the bewildering detail in which kabbalists describe the analogous structures of the descending chain of emanations, all identically "sealed" with the Holy Name YHWH. Nonetheless, the basic idea is frequently expressed in movingly simple words. Azikri repeatedly impresses upon his readers: And thou, man, know that thy soul is the seat of God ... the principal dwelling place of the Shekhinah is in the heart of the Jew ... and so also has Rabbi Simon bar Yokhai explained the verse [Deut. 23:15; acc. to A.V. 23:24] "For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp"-the 'midst' that is the heart which is in the midst of thy 'camp' i.e. the body .... How much, therefore, should man sanctify himself in body, heart and soul, since he is a temple of the Holy King .... "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel" [Amos 4:12], for thy soul is His throne and thine heart is His footstool [cf. Isa. 66:1] . . . "and where is the place of His rest?"-it is in the heart, as the Sages have said: God exists in the hearts of his lovers.... He who receives a king in his house, would he not sweep it and clean it? Since the hearts of Jews are His house, we should sweep from them all the rubble and dust of sinful thoughts.... The royal road to devekuth was solitary contemplation and the re- duction of all talk, business, and social intercourse to the barest mini- mum. Even in the world one should not be of it: "The light of the face of the Living King rests on thine head; keep silent in His fear. And if thou speakest, speak to Him alone and the listener [i.e., your partner in worldly intercourse] may hear. In this way you will practice permanent devekuth." The relation to the world and its duties is there- fore indirect, oblique, and purely external. The two types of mystical solitude, the seclusion of the hermit and the seclusion "in" the world, are exemplified by Noah in the ark, and Azikri's interpretation of Gen. 6:9 on two mystical levels corresponds exactly to the two stages of Abgeschiedenheit, distinguished by all mystics and so beautifully expressed in one of Tersteegen's stanzas: Ich wahlte vormals Ort und Zeit Zum Beten und zur Einsamkeit; Nun bet' ich stets im stillen Sinn, Nun bin ich einsam wo ich bin. It is written [Gen. 6:9] "and Noah walked with God." This signifies that he secluded himself with his Creator and avoided human company. Or else it may signify that he was so advanced in the practice of solitude that even when he was among men they did not distract him, for they were as non-existent in his eyes.... A man in the company of others is like unto one who has fallen into the sea-unless he swims well he will be drowned; but if he flees society and 24</page><page sequence="17">secludes himself with his Creator, then he is like in a boat, saved and in com- munion with God.... The use made here of the image of the sea is extremely significant and suggestive. For, whereas in mystical literature generally this com- monplace metaphor signifies the Divine Infinite in which the indi- vidual soul (the "drop") loses itself, it here means the world which threatens to swallow the contemplative. He must therefore isolate himself "in a boat" and fall back on his own, solitary personality which can then enter into communion with God. The maintenance of the personality as implied by the image of the boat on the infinite sea is an apt illustration of the meaning of devekuth as compared with the radical "annihilation in unification" type of Sufi unio mystica. But solitude is more than withdrawal from the world or society; it is also withdrawal from one's body. Prayer is therefore an act of double withdrawal. A man's home should be the House of the Lord where he can be alone, particularly at night: Even as one should make an effort and settle in the Holy Land, so the next step on the spiritual ascent should be the effort to spend the greater part of one's day and night in the Synagogue and the House of Study. There he should find his rest and peace and joy, as the sages have said: Synagogues and Houses of Study are Paradise for the righteous and a prison for the wicked. A son should offer savoury meat to his father and mother ... and God delighteth in his creature arising at midnight to practise devekuth with him in solitude... Life is nothing but the reality of God's light shining on man; how could man remain unaware of it? "The light of God illumines thy face and thus thou livest; when He hides it, immediately man perishes. How then canst thou hide thy face and not contemplate Him always?" This realization is particularly important during prayer with its devekuth of double widthrawal: The Rabbis have taught that at prayer there should be no interception be- tween the worshipper and the wall. This signifies the [immediate communion with the] Shekhinah, for which one has to remove all evil thoughts or even thoughts that are not evil from one's heart.... Another explanation is that the body should not intercept [between the soul and God] but should be as non- existent so that the soul can cleave to the divine soul as a magnet to an iron. .. You should make an effort to concentrate your mind with devekuth when- ever you utter the name of God, and this is the meaning of the phrase [I Sam. 1:15] "I have poured out my soul before the Lord," removing all partitions. It behooves us to abstract the body from the soul during prayer, as Rabbi Jonah of Gerona52 has already written.... It is interesting to note how the extreme demands of devekuth turned solitude into a major virtue in spite of the strong social motives 62 Rabbi Jonah "the Pious" or "the Great" of Gerona (thirteenth century); his short penitential tracts were widely read. 25</page><page sequence="18">Mystical and Magical Contemplation operating in the community. There were not only the devout brother- hoods, banding together in pursuit of redemption and perfection, the corporate visits to the tomb of Rabbi Simon bar Yokhai and the study of the Zohar there, and the habit of mutual confessions of sin. There was also the more general and all pervading stress on the value of performing all religious ceremonies and divine commandments "in company." On the other hand, the opposite tendency was no less strongly at work extolling solitude as a sine qua non of the truly per- fect state. The stress on solitude had appeared in earlier periods too,53 but had never combined in such extraordinary fashion with powerful social values and motives. The problem is a well-known one in the sociology of religion; the hermit's cave becomes a monastery, and ascetic contemplatives combine in religious orders to model social organizations. It seems that the social habits and values of the Safed kabbalists helped to integrate the individual mystic in an ideal, normative community which gave him spiritual security and support and which provided him with a fund of energy and discipline on which he could constantly draw. But he was never allowed to forget that in seeking God he was always a monos pros monon: How can you fail to practise solitude with God? Behold, most of your time you are alone: alone in your mother's womb, alone when you sleep, the body is lonely and the soul is lonely; the body is solitary in the grave and the soul is solitary in Paradise, for "every righteous soul has a dwelling place according to its dignity"54 ... therefore hearken unto my voice, always walk with Him and do not separate yourself [from Him] for a moment but seek Him and ye shall find Him, He will not part from thee, O how good and how pleasant is His company. Characteristically enough, this exhortation knows of no expectation of life eternal in the happy company of saints (whose counterpart in traditional Jewish eschatology is eternal study in the celestial acade- mies in the company of all the prophets, teachers, and rabbis) but the utter solitude of the soul, transfigured by the bliss of solitude fulfilled in the presence of the divine Beloved. The community is something to be left behind and forgotten: "I and He, save us, we beseech Thee"55 this means when I and He are alone at the proper times of solitude, as expounded in [Bahya ibn Pakuda's] Book of the Duties of the Heart. Alternatively it can mean that even when 1 am 63 Bahya, Abulafia a.o.; cf. also Maimonides, Guide iii. 51. 64 A rabbinic saying, quoted from BT Sabbath 152a. 65s Ani va-hu hoshicah na: according to the Mishnah Sukkah (iv. 5), this was how the Hosannah (Ps. 118:25: "0 Lord, save us, we beseech Thee") was pro- nounced in the Temple. The formula had early given rise to mystical speculations (cf. also C. H. Dodd, The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel [1953], pp. 94-96). 26</page><page sequence="19">among people ... no created thing will separate between me and you [i.e., God], for compared to Him they are all like nothing, and I and He are quite alone.... Azikri avers that solitude was the traditional practice of Jewish mystics: We find in the ascetic writings of the ancients that the pious used to practise ascetic solitude and devekuth, which means that when they were alone they withdrew their minds from all worldly things and concentrated [lit., bound] their thoughts on the Lord of all .... This is the meaning of the report in the Mishnah [Berakhoth V. 1] "the early hasidim used to wait [i.e., prepare them- selves] one hour before praying [and one hour afterward] in order to concen- trate their mind on God." The commentators56 explained this to mean that they cleared their minds from all worldly things, concentrating on the Lord of all with fear and love. They thus took off nine hours57 from the study of To- rah58 and devoted this time to solitary contemplation and devekuth. Then they would imagine the light of the Shekhinah above their heads as though it were flowing all around them and they were sitting in the midst of the light. So also have I found it [described] in an old manuscript of the ancient ascetics.59 And while in that [state of meditation] they are all trembling as a natural effect but [spiritually] rejoicing in trembling as it is written [Ps. 2:11] "Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling...." The theme is resumed again by Azikri toward the end of his book: The fifth condition [for the attainment of the state of devekuth] is the prac- tice of solitary contemplation as described above.... At the appropriate 56 Cf. R. Jonah of Gerona ad loc. (in his commentary to Alfasi's talmudic di- gest). 57 Reckoning one hour for each of the three statutory prayers of the day, plus one hour before and one after each prayer. 68 It may be useful to quote the comments of the Talmud to this Mishnah (BT Berakhoth 32b): "The early Hasidim used to wait one hour, then pray, and then wait another hour.-But if they spent nine hours of the day in prayer, how did they remember the Law (for even if once learned, Torah requires constant memo- rizing and repetition), and how did they do their work (i.e. earn their bread)?- Because they were saintly men, they easily remembered the Torah (which they had learned previously) and their work was blessed (i.e., little effort produced sufficient for their needs)." This passage is significant because it implicitly states the hasidic- contemplative scale of values: prayer and meditation are essential spiritual values, whereas Torah is something one should "know" and remember but not to be "meditated" all the time. It appears that there is practical value in knowing the Law, but no intrinsic value at all in the activity of studying, viz. "meditating" (cf. Ps. 1:2) it. For the opposite, more academic and non-hasidic evaluation of Torah and prayer, cf. BT Sabbath 10a, as compared with ibid. 33b, BT Berakhoth i. 2 (fol. 8a) and Mekhilta ad Exod. 16:4. There Torah is considered as the sole fit object of meditation, and prayer is classed as "worldly activity" (sic!). The Study of the Law being a central value in Jewish religiosity, the very idea of opposing Talmud Torah to contemplation (viz., to contemplative prayer) represents a criti- cal development in Jewish spirituality. The problem came to a head in eighteenth- century Hasidism (cf. Scholem, "Devekuth or Communion with God in Hasidic Doctrine," Review of Religion, XIV, No. 2 [1950], 127-28). 69 As Scholem has shown (op. cit., p. 119), Azikri's source is Rabbi Azriel of Gerona. 27</page><page sequence="20">Mystical and Magical Contemplation times one should withdraw to a secluded place where one cannot be seen by others, lift up one's eyes on high to the one King, the Cause of all causes, like a mark for the arrow [of the contemplative ascent]: "as in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man" [Prov. 27:19] and similarly as man turns his face to his God so also will He turn to him and they will cleave together [in mystical communion]. This I have heard from my master and teacher, the holy and pious Rabbi Joseph Sagis and this was also his practice. Similarly I have found in the writings of Rabbi Isaac of Acre that this was the practice of some pious men in his time and you will find the same in the writings of Mai- monides, Nahmanides, Bahya ibn Pakuda and Rabbi Jonah of Gerona. Here the extreme practice of devekuth almost reaches the point where it ceases to be compatible with the traditional Jewish virtues of the study of the law and the "performance of the divine command- ments in community." Azikri's manual recommends a spiritual prac- tice that would lead to the experience of devekuth, but does not make it clear to what extent and in what sense this experience is ecstatic or not. We cannot even be sure that Azikri really gives us the whole story. But taking his manual as it is, it must be noted that it teaches no mystical techniques or formulas60 beyond the purely spiritual prac- tice of contemplation, prayer, solitude, and the intense yearning of love. There are no indications that the mystic aspires to illumination in the sense of revealed knowledge and celestial indoctrination. All that he seems to seek is the immediate, mystical awareness of the presence of God. For other kabbalists, devekuth was definitely a more active and, at the same time, more "revealing" state. At the very out- set of their mystical quest they asked for more-and apparently re- ceived more. Thus Vital's Gates of Holiness were composed because, as the author says: I saw exalted souls, though but a few, desiring to ascend, but ignorant of the [mystical] ladder. They study ancient books to seek and find the paths of life, the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do61 in order to raise their soul to its supernal root and make it cleave to Him who is eternal perfection, according to the manner of the ancient prophets who were in a state of communion with their Creator throughout their lives. Here the cat is very quietly let out of the bag in the apparently harm- less association of the practice of devekuth with prophecy.62 The notion that the "prophet" is the ideal type of the perfect man implies 60 No reader of the Sefer Haredim can help noticing the wide difference between the essential character of Azikri's spirituality, on the one hand, and the kabbalistic theories he shared with his contemporaries, on the other. 61 This apparently innocent quotation from Exod. 18:20 may well have a magi- cal overtone: there are certain esoteric techniques which one has to know if the mystical opus is to succeed. 62 The indebtedness of this association to Maimonides (Guide iii. 51) is obvious; cf. also above, pp. 16-17. 28</page><page sequence="21">that the prophetic charisma is the fruit and hence also the necessary concomitant or result of proper devekuth: By means of their devekuth the Holy Spirit rested on them, teaching them "the way where light dwelleth" and illuminating their eyes with the mysteries of the Torah ... to cleave unto Him ... for the prophet cleaveth to God by drawing down the influx of prophecy and divine blessing on the nether beings. The cognitive, intellectual element in contemplation reasserts itself here, since devekuth is the means for obtaining the Holy Spirit or pro- phetic influx and the latter is identical, to all intents and purposes, with the revelation of kabbalistic "mysteries," that is, doctrines. According to Vital, the original prophetic tradition was continued by the ancient hasidim known as "ascetics" [lit., "Pharisees"] ... who retired into the caves of rocks and into the desert, withdrawing from all social intercourse. Some of them were hermits in their houses living [at home] as in a desert and praising their Creator without interruption, day and night, with the study of Torah and the Psalms of David ... until their mind cleaved with a mighty force and passion to the supernal lights. But the mystic tradition was lost, and in its stead came dubious at- tempts to secure illumination by methods that made it difficult to distinguish celestial from demonic inspiration: In the end despair of ever discovering this wonderful wisdom seized the hearts of men ... [and as a result] some began to adjure the angels by the power of the Holy Names, expecting light but behold there was darkness be- cause the angels [that appeared] were very inferior ones, appointed over worldly affairs [and not over spiritual matters] and composed of good and evil elements so that their revelations too were a composite of good and evil, of truth and falsehood and all manner of vanities such as [magical] healing, alchemy, and the techniques of amulets and magical formulae ... would God that their hearts were set only on [the study of] Torah and [the performance of] the commandments. The "Four Travellers" to the garden of mystical knowledge63 are held up as warning examples. It is true that the four heroes of the talmudic legend risked too much by attempting to attain the highest mystical reaches, whereas we should be happy to attain the lower manifestations of the Holy Spirit such as the apparition of the prophet Elijah which, as is well known, was vouch- safed to many, or such as the apparition of the souls of departed saints . . . and even in our time I have seen holy men who have attained this. Another form [of charismatic illumination] is that man's own soul, if it is much purified, appears to him and guides him on all his ways. All these methods are within the reach of worthy adepts even in our own time. 63 BT Hagigah 14b; cf. also Scholem, MTJM, pp. 52-53, and Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (1960), pp. 14 ff. 29</page><page sequence="22">Mystical and Magical Contemplation In fact "we have heard and seen ourselves how choice spirits have in our time attained the degree of [direct inspiration by] the Holy Spirit whereby they could foretell the future. Some of them possessed wis- dom that was not revealed to previous generations." Nevertheless, the danger of involvement with the demonic world is very real when- ever "prophetic" experience is actively solicited: "But it requires great discrimination and much experience to find out the truth [about these matters], for perhaps it was an alien, impure spirit that was with him." Vital's ladder of ascent begins with counsels of moral and ascetic perfection and ends with almost magical formulas which so alarmed the publisher of the little book that he left them in manuscript. His pious reticence is an eloquent tribute to the magical character of Vital's ascetic instruction, for our printed text ends with the announce- ment: "Thus speaketh the printer: this fourth part will not be printed for it is all Holy Names and the Secret Mysteries which it would be unseemly to publish."64 We may ignore, for the present, the extremely complicated and confusing ontology and anthropology which Vital outlines as the background of his theory of prophecy and inspiration. According to this system of combined anthropology and cosmology, man's ideal nature is such that contact with the highest, divine sphere is possible and even necessary if man is to fulfil his proper function and purpose in the cosmic economy. In spite of the proliferation of intermediate, emanated "worlds" in Lurianic Kabbalah, there is an essential unity to this great chain of being. The "lower" is always also the "outer" cover, garment, or shell, surrounding the preceding "higher," namely, more "interior," level of existence to which it is re- lated like body to soul. This unity or repeated mystical analogy of infinite cosmic levels is emphatically brought out by another formula- tion according to which all "worlds," that is, stages of emanation, share the same anthropomorphic structure in spite of the vast hier- archical differences between them. From the celestial makro-anthropos down to earthly man the same structure infinitely repeats itself. Al- ready the exalted world of divine sefiroth reflects the even higher sphere of the Adam Kadmon. It is thus easy to see how man is in principle fit to attain the state of prophecy. He merely has to estab- lish immediate contact with the highest, that is, deepest and most hidden divine sphere; he can do this by making use of the structure of the cosmos, the chain of being, and the essential identity of his own structure with that of all the higher worlds. The requirements for this 64 Cf. Scholem, MTJM, p. 122. 30</page><page sequence="23">ascent are that he purge himself of matter and the passions, sanctify his soul by strict observance of the divine commandments, acquire perfect humility and constant joy, and practice contemplative devekuth. The specifically magical element of Vital's theory of contemplation and prophecy inheres in his refusal to admit that inspiration auto- matically follows devekuth.65 Between the attainment of devekuth and the influx of the Holy Spirit there must intervene a specific magico- meditative activity whose effect is to "trigger off," as it were, the down- ward movement of the divine influx. A rough outline of Vital's scala contemplationis would be somewhat like this: 1. Ascetic purification and sanctification, preparatory to devekuth proper. 2. Meditation, preceded by complete withdrawal of the mind from all bodily and material things and sensations and by absolute mental vacuity due to the absence of sense impressions. In this connection it is important to re- member that in Vital's terminology the important word hithpashtuth does not mean ecstasy as, for example, in later, hasidic usage. The term is used only in the description of this second stage of contemplation, and its con- notation is purely negative : withdrawal from material sensations. Actually, Vital's system knows no ek-stasis strictu sensu because the soul does not leave the body behind, except in the lowest form of inspiration: dreams. There is no real ascent of the soul similar to the Himmelsfahrt of the Merka- bah mystics or of other systems of contemplation. Hithpashtuth means the abstraction of the mind from worldly mental contents so that the imagina- tive faculty, which continues to function, can exercise itself on other, higher realities. The same imaginative faculty which usually works on ma- terial supplied by the senses is now free to imagine and contemplate more spiritual things. 3. A purely imaginative ascent of the soul to its individual "root" or source in the higher world: "Then the imaginative faculty will turn your thoughts to imagine and picture [mental contents] as if it ascended in the higher worlds up to the roots of his soul . . . until the imagined image reaches his highest source and there the images of the [supernal] lights are imprinted on his mind as if he imagined and saw them in the same way in which his imagina- tive faculty normally pictures in his mind mental contents deriving from the world...." The decisive role attributed here to the imaginative faculty is clearly dependent on Maimonides' theory of prophecy.66 According to Vital's adaptation of it, the essence of mystical meditation is "contempla- tion as if." What makes this contemplative but purely imaginative ascent as seriously real as the less sophisticated and more ecstatic Himmelsfahrt of earlier adepts, is the underlying doctrine of the "magical" power of all acts of meditation and concentration, particularly when supported by the right formulas. The meditative ascent, though taking place in the imagination only, thus makes the same real impact on the higher worlds and has the 66 As the neoplatonic theory of contemplation, followed by Maimonides, would imply. 66 See Guide ii. 36. 31</page><page sequence="24">Mystical and Magical Contemplation same effects on the soul as would a real ascent through the heavens in which the soul ecstatically left the body. "This influx and substantial light [which as a result of the contemplative exercise is infused into the mystic's soul] is what is called Thought (mahashavah). Understand this well, for it is no vain thing. If this were not so [that imaginative meditation pro- duces these results], then the whole kabbalistic doctrine concerning the right 'intentions' and devotions at prayer (kawwanoth) and concerning [the mystical significance of] man's good and evil thoughts were as good as nothing. You will understand why prophecy is not only possible but neces- sary; it is as if a man held fast to the end of a bent down branch of a tree: when he shakes it [i.e., his bit of branch] with sufficient strength, then of necessity the whole tree is shaken with it." 4. In his imaginative ascent the mystic contemplates the ten sefiroth. Open- ing himself to their irradiation, he exalts and raises them to the highest sphere of En Sof. From this highest point the light is then "reflected" and flows back ( or hozer). The contemplative who draws the light in the reverse direction, down on his own "soul root," thereby also irradiates the sefiroth themselves which are now illumined by the reflex-light flowing down from En Sof. The mystic then proceeds to draw, that is, conduct and direct the light further downward through the innumerable worlds and stages of the kabbalistic cosmos, down to his rational soul and from there down to his animal soul which is the seat of the imaginative faculty and therefore the locus where the prophetic, that is, the spiritual-imaginative experience takes place: "and there [in his animal soul] these [heavenly, spiritual] things will be pictured in material images by the imaginative faculty, and then he will apprehend them as if he saw them with his bodily eyes." Occasion- ally the imaginative faculty may even externalize or project the effects of this "light," so that the experience becomes one of external sense impres- sions, such as of the apparition of angelic messengers, the hearing of voices, etc. Vital sums up the whole process in the following words: "The thought of the prophet expands and rises from one level to another ... until he arrives at the point where the root of his soul is sunk [in the divine world]. Next he concentrates on raising the light of the sefirah to En Sof and from there he draws the light down, from on high down to his rational soul and from there, by means of the imaginative faculty, down to his animal soul, and there all things are pictured either by the inner senses of the imagina- tive faculty or by the outer senses." The crucial point, as far as the magical character of this meditation is concerned, is the transition from the contemplative ascent to the reverse movement of drawing the light, that is, the divine influx, down (hamshakhath hamshashavah). This all-important reversal can only be effected by special intense meditations and formulas (yihudim, hazkarah shemoth). The use of "Holy Names" is indispensable in the Lurianic system of meditation. This fact is indisputable. Its consist- ency with Vital's repeated and grave warnings against the use of hashbacoth (magic formulas, literally, "Beschworungen") is more ap- parent than real. It is true that Vital never tires of stressing the 32</page><page sequence="25">dangers inherent in the use of such formulas. Their use can be risked with impunity only by saints in a state of perfect purity; otherwise the adept lets himself in with the demonic powers and is lost. Vital mentions the well-known legend of Joseph dela Reyna and the martyr Solomon Molcho (!) as warning examples. This "practical Kabbalah" is to be eschewed, particularly by the present generation, so gravely deficient in purity and saintliness and living, as it does, in an age in which only the lowest "world of cAsiyah" is accessible to hashbacoth and can be magically manipulated. The saints of ancient times, whose spiritual life moved on higher planes than the "world of cAsiyah" could and did use Holy Names during their mystic ascent in order to unlock the various celestial gates and to gain access to particular celestial "worlds," "stages," or "mansions." These formulas were ef- fective because each was appropriately applied to the individual angel or guardian in charge of a particular sefirah, region, or celestial "gate." Vital thus completely absorbs the venerable Merkabah-tradition of pacifying, exorcising, and coercing the archonts, celestial powers, and keepers of the gates. But by prohibiting, or at least by discouraging, its practice, he to all intents and purposes also eliminates it. However, what Vital discards is the use of formulas to aid the mystical ascensus (hashbacoth); what he insists on and actually develops as a major feature of his system are special formulas for the descensus, that is, for reversing the flow of the divine light (yihudim). Without yihudim the influx from the highest point in En Sof to the lowest terminus in the animal soul cannot be brought down. It is important to realize clearly the nature of the difference be- tween illegitimate hashbacoth and indispensable yihudim. The former, according to Vital, were never meant as an alternative to yihudim; the practice of the latter is therefore not affected by the condemnation of hashbacoth. The one is concerned with effecting the ascent, the other with bringing about the reverse flow of the divine light and its in- fusion into the soul. The difference between legitimate and illegitimate use of Holy Names is therefore not one of pure versus selfish inten- tions. No doubt this is how the difference was understood by earlier schools of magical contemplation. Thus, according to Abraham Abulafia, the same formulas might be used legitimately-if the aim was communion with God and the state of prophetic perfection-or sinfully-if the purpose were the acquisition of magical power. This latter possibility is not even discussed by Vital in the present context; it is too obviously damnable to merit consideration. The distinction, for Vital, is not between unselfish and holy versus selfish and worldly use of the magical power of the Divine Names, but between formulas 33</page><page sequence="26">Mystical and Magical Contemplation of ascent and formulas of descent. Originally both were used and taught. The disciples of the prophets of old were taught, in addition to the kawwanoth and yihudim that are indispensable even today, also "certain prayer formulae and Divine Names to be used against the guardians of the celestial gates . . . and in this way they ascended higher and higher .... And concerning the gate-keepers and the Holy Names it is thus: they adjured [the gate-keepers] with the power of the appropriate Holy Name. ..." In fact, the whole Merkabah vision of the prophet Ezekiel is nothing but an account of such an ascent by means of hashbacoth. But today it behooves the adept to sanctify himself to such a degree that he can pass the gates without special incantations. However, once "inside," namely, "high up"- whether aided by formulas or not-the mystic still has to meditate, to raise the lights to En Sof, and finally to reverse their flow and direct it downward. The possibilities of pneumatic life are clearly stated by Vital: Concerning the manner of attaining the Holy Spirit I have already ex- plained . . . that there are five manners: the Holy Spirit [in the narrow sense], the souls of departed saints, angels of the type called maggidim, Elijah and dreams; every one of these can be mediated through Elijah and without re- sorting to any [magical] act, purely as a result of a man's saintliness and his devotion to the Law. It is also possible to attain all these by means of specific actions, but for this one must be worthy and well-prepared for enlightenment. The rejection of hashbacoth consequently only means that formulas em- ploying power over angels and ministering spirits should be excluded from the mystical exercise and that the initial ascent should be ef- fected solely by means of ascetic discipline, piety, and contemplative devekuth. In a way the halfheartedness of Vital in this matter comes out in the fact that in spite of his grave warnings, he did write down the practical method of hazkarah shemoth; if the technique remained largely unknown, this was due to the printer's discretion and not to Vital's. But in any case we must fall back on the method of yihudim, for without it there is no attainment of prophecy: for this drawing down of the influx (hamshakhath hamshashavah) certainly never comes about by itself but is effected solely by the kawwanoth and yihudim transmitted to the disciple by the prophet who taught him the art of prophecy.... By these yihudim he was then enabled to draw down the light and the influx according to his wish, and this is the ultimate purpose of the whole subject of prophecy. Vital himself summarizes the procedure to be followed in this way. The adept begins by preparing himself by "four purifications," the first two of which are of a more general nature, whereas the other two are specific preparations for the reception of the Holy Spirit. They are 34</page><page sequence="27">(a) repentance for all sins of omission and commission, (b) scrupulous observance of all commandments positive and negative, particularly of prayer and the love of one's fellow man, (c) material purification, that is, ritual immersions and the wearing of clean garments, (d) silence and solitude, preferably after midnight. Thus prepared, the adept should close his eyes, withdraw his mind from all worldly things as if his soul had left the body and he was insensible like a dead corpse. Thereafter he should make an effort to meditate with great passion on the higher [spiritual] world and to cleave there to the roots of his soul and to the supernal lights. He should imagine in his mind as if his soul had left him and was ascending on high, and he should picture the higher worlds as if he actually stood there. And if he per- forms any yihud, he should intend thereby to draw the light and the influx down on all the worlds and also intend to receive his own share in the end. His "own share" is, of course, the measure of illumination or prophecy which is due to the adept. If nothing happens in spite of all his spiritual exercises, it is a sure sign that the adept is not yet worthy; he should, therefore, continue his preparatory discipline. Once attained, the prophetic state is still far from perfect. First, the adept has to examine himself very carefully to make sure that his inspiration is pure and uncontaminated by evil or falsehood: "This can be tested by the contents of the revelation, whether all his words are true ... or whether his words contain empty things about the vanities of this world or things that are not in accordance with the Law and such like." In the second place, he has to cultivate this con- templative and prophetic habit or state, so that his prophecy can deepen and develop: Know that at first the Spirit will come upon him as if by accident, on rare occasions only, and also the contents of the revelations will be slight, and not profound, and moreover little in quantity. But as he continues his power will increase.... The basic principle of the mystical life is to purge oneself to the utmost of matter, to eradicate all worldly thoughts and the activity of the imaginative faculty with regard to them, and to adhere with the closest possible adhesion to the higher worlds. Azikri and Vital are two contrasted and, perhaps, extreme examples of sixteenth-century Safed spirituality; yet they may well serve to indicate the variety and range of mystical life possible within a prima facie so limited and homogeneous group as that of the kabbalist saints in sixteenth-century Safed. From a Sufi-like abandon to the love of God, more reminiscent of Bahya's Duties of the Heart than of the Zohar, to the thoroughly magical conception of devekuth as an active stimulation of the Holy Spirit, sixteenth-century kabbalism had room for the silent dialogue of the soul with the divine Beloved and for the 35</page><page sequence="28">Mystical and Magical Contemplation "prophetic" inspiration of the intellect with theosophical gnosis. No doubt from the point of view of certain theological systems, Vital's method can hardly qualify as contemplative mysticism. But, whereas it is perfectly legitimate for theologians to measure religious phe- nomena with their particular yardsticks, the student of comparative religion is denied this privilege. If we want to distinguish between mystical systems (e.g., between Tantric Buddhism and St. John of the Cross), then we have only the descriptive criteria provided by phe- nomenological analysis to go by. Rather than give marks for "higher" and "lower," "true" and "false," "sacred" and "profane" mysticism and the like, we may profitably analyze the different types of mystical activity according to the objects, if any, which they intend; the degrees of conscious, goal-directed effort which they exhibit; the nature of the goals as well as that of the efforts leading to them; the relation of the human to the divine initiatives as conceived by the mystics themselves; etc. It is as a concrete example of one small aspect of this complex variety that two types of kabbalistic practice have here been compared and described as mystical and magical contemplation, respectively. 36</page></plain_text>
