In his Introduction the author writes: "It is the purpose of this essay not primarily at any rate to seek for Virgil's own personal religion, but to conduct a rather more detailed examination ... into the religious ideas and practices which find their place in his poems." This purpose is admirably worked out in chapters cover- ing "Magic, Omen, and Prophecy"; "Old Italian Religion"; "The State Cult"; "The Graeco-Roman Gods"; "Oriental Gods, Cos- mological Gods, Worship of the Emperor"; "Fate and the Gods"; and "The Dead and the Underworld." This book is not a manual of Roman religion and is compara- tively free of the documentation rightly expected of such a manual. Indeed, the disentanglement of truly Roman religion from its over- burden of extraneous elements, expecially Greek, had been pre- viously done by Wissowa, Fowler, Mannhardt, Frazer, and by Bailey himself. The value of the work under review lies rather in the fact that an expert in Roman religion has made an independent investigation of the poems of Vergil against the background of all that we know of the old Roman religion. The result is a dependable evaluation of the religious ideas of Vergil's time as revealed in the poems themselves. The teacher of Vergil who is not an expert in Roman religion will find in this book exactly what he needs to know about the religious element in those poems. For example, Vergil's fine ani- 507</page><page sequence="2">508 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL mistic feeling for the old gods of woodland and stream is made clear by the discussion of his use of such Latin words as religio, numen, sacer, and pius, and the reader is made to see how the prayers of the Aeneid follow genuine Italian tradition even though they do not retain the antique formulae we find in Cato. Though Greek anthropomorphism and Greek philosophy had caused many of the old gods to fade in Vergil's mind, he still retains a lively af- fection for them. His feeling for Venus, Juno, and Jupiter is much deeper, for in them he conceived a triad which together represent Rome's ultimate government of the world. Moreover, "in the idea of pietas, the ready obedience to the will of heaven, which was also the bond of the common life in the family and the State, there lies a conception which was fundamental to his outlook on the world...." Though one is inclined to agree with the author in most of what he says of the amalgamation of Greek and Roman gods, one may be allowed to doubt whether Ceres is a goddess of fertility of pure Italic history, and to wish in general that the author had given more weight to the very stimulating studies of Altheim.' The chapter on "Fate and the Gods" is probably the best in the book. Fatum, the author maintains, may mean in Vergil's poems the fate of an individual, or of a god (numen), or even world des- tiny, i.e., the Stoic providentia. The supreme Fatum is equivalent to the numen, or will, of Jupiter, as rex deorum. In the last chapter we have a fine presentation of the growth of Roman concepts of the underworld from the hazy beginnings such as are found in the Odyssey, through the rich additions of Orphism, Pythagoreanism, Platonism, and Stoicism, all fused into a com- plete and satisfying whole by supreme poetic art, and leading to the conclusion that the dead through suffering come into a richer life by metempsychosis, and that even in the life of mortals suffer- ing is a means to salvation. The volume is very attractively printed and few errors were 1 Franz Altheim, Griechische Gitter im Alten Rom: Giessen, T6pelmann (1930); idem, Terra Mater: Giessen, Topelmann (1931).</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 509 observed by the reviewer.
