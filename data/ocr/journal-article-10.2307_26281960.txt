Although the contemporary Brazilian novel is as variegated in substance and narrative technique as that of any na tional literature, there exists intriguing thematic parallels throughout many works of that country's most respected writers. The grotesque motif born of the tension of innocent victims confronting torture is so pandemic that it is now recognizable as a full-fledged archetype.1 Often history relies on the novelist to aid in documenting in palpable and human terms the political failings of an era. George A. Panichas has stated: "To a large degree history, not literary aesthetic, dic tates sensibility and belief in twentieth-century literature" (xxvi). Ribeiro's novel masterfully fuses very real sociopolitical concerns, the aesthetic experience, and his role as modern-day mythmaker. It is truly a protean masterpiece; an elegantly wrought study that is, on balance, one of the most distinguished pieces of modern Brazilian fiction. Peter S. Prescott calls the work a "splendid novel," and writer-critic Erico Venssimo observes: "It is something unique. It derives nothing from any other book."2 The supreme compli ment comes from the internationally acclaimed novelist Jorge Amado: "Among the works of fiction published in Brazil in the last decade, few have been as important as Joäo Ubaldo Ribeiro's Sergeant Getulio ..." (139).3 The present analysis focuses upon Sergeant Getiilio from the primary perspective of its inherent artistic integrity, its accommoda tion of mythic topoi, and the cogency of its vision of one man's journey to redemption. Charles I. Glicksburg, in analyzing the zoological metaphor in modern literature, observes that this metaphorical metamorphosis "... drives home the absurdity of investing human life with a divine 'Citing but a few of the major contemporary Brazilian novels that strongly express the pervasive influence of this motif: Ignàcio de Loyola Brandâo, Zero (1974); Antonio Callado, Bar Don Juan (1972); Ivan Angelo, The Celebration (1975); the sexual blackmail scene of Cremilda de Tal; Moacyr Scliar's Rafael Mendts' Strange Nation (1983) in the inquisition scene. To this same end, one of the instruments of torture—the pau-de-arara, the "parrot's perch"— serves as the title for French novelist Michel Roy's best-selling book Le perchoir du perroguet (1983). 'Verissmo's quote comes from the Nova Fronteira edition of Sergeant Getùlio. The quote is undocumented, but Verissmo continues, "In my opinion, the book will remain as one of the benchmarks of our fiction" (161). The translation is my own. 3Amado's Afterword and the novel itself were translated by Ribciro himself. It is a remarkable translation. Ribeiro attended the University of Southern California and was one of the many Brazilian authors who have come to Iowa City to take part in its International Writing Program. Others who come to mind include Roberto Reis, Luiz Vilela, Flâvio Moreira da Costa, Julio César Monteiro Martins, and Sergio Sant'Anna. 450 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="3">purpose or any purpose at all; it reinforces the suspicion that the emergence of consciousness is in the service of instinct, an emana tion of the blind energy of Nature" (39-40). There exists no character in contemporary fiction who has so incarnated this "blind energy of Nature" than has Ribeiro's Sergeant Getulio. No other work of modern fiction so strongly concentrates on analyzing this "con sciousness in the service of instinct." This work stands in marked contrast to the narrative innovations and authorial playfulness that form such an integral part of the contemporary Brazilian novel. Ribeiro's style and focus could well be termed neo-Dostoevskian. His novel's central conciousness is a modern-day underground man, an exmilitia sergeant working for a local political boss. Ribeiro's narrator, Getulio, in the fashion of Dostoevsky's unnamed civil ser vant in Notes from Underground, tenders his jaundiced views on life from manhood to hair cream to sex and torture, all within the con text of an extended monologue, a protracted soliloquy that acquires mythic and anthropomorphic dimensions. Jon S. Vincent's reading of Grande Sertäo Veredas illustrates the interplay between the "autobiographical account ... of the narrator" and the nonregistered speech of "the interlocutor" (65). An analogous nar rative structure exists in Sergeant Getulio with Amaro, his driver, be ing his silent sounding board. The epic dimensions of this book can be derived from the Odys syan journey that Getulio embarks upon, becoming a symbolic Grail Quest.4 There are present many préfigurations of traditional epic formulae: the journey itself, the hyperbolic nature of Getülio's feats of violence, the larger-than-life aspect of the hero's being, the threshold crossing, the legendary quality of his reputation, his trials against overwhelming odds, and the continual use of his name as an incantation. "My name is a verse: Getulio Santos Bezerra . . ." (118). "I am the Bogey Dragon. Eater of hearts" (115). " 'Your name is a verse,' Luzinete said, 'and you are never going to die' " (118). The work's many mythic and epic correspondences strongly sug gest that the novel is archetypically rich, transcending a purely sociological reading. Ribeiro has created a unique epic hero who is not the embodiment of a nation's hopes and ideals but who is 'See Arlett. In his analysis Arlett offers a component definition of the contemporary epic novel, stating, "Since Plato, as they have found 'epic' a useful term in their engage ment with the major works of an age or civilization, writers have tended to define epicism in ways that fit their particular critical uses" (173). He goes on to observe that many modern novels such as Barth's Chimera, Bellow's Herzog, Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Fine, and Pyn chon's Gravity's Rainbow "frequently invite—by scope, structure, or allusion to their own literary status—epic considerations" (174). JOAO UBALDO RIBEIRO 451</page><page sequence="4">a hellish emanation of will, the violent will of the sertäo, the backlands. As such, the novel's vision can be considered sociomythic, perhaps reacting to a political reality that needed to be addressed in aesthetic terms. The plot line, in its simplicity, is expressed immediately by the author: "In this story Sergeant Getulio takes a prisoner from Paulo Afonso to Barra dos Coqueiros" (7). Then the flat value judgment is added: "It is a tale of virtue" (7). Getulio is hired to bring back a political enemy of one of the local politicians. He captures the man, and they cross Sergipe province in an old bullet-ridden Hud son, driven by Amaro. Throughout the journey Getulio freely of fers his inverted sense of morality and his puerile views of politics and life. "A profession is a profession. I don't like doctors. I never shot a doctor. Or did I? I can't remember. . . . Gravedigging, what a miserable profession. All men from Paraiba are gravediggers. Paraiba is Brazil" (20). "I went over to help hold the girl, so that he could hit her once or twice. She deserved it. A woman who has seen a man in such a state is a whore. Or will be. Punishment does good" (49). In broad terms, then, Sergeant Getulio can be seen as an allegory of confrontation between civilization and the last stages of Brazilian barbarism. This work, however, is more a multilayered confronta tion that, on the first level of meaning, dramatizes the tension be tween victim and oppressor. This novel's victim is the true inno cent. The prisoner is totally dehumanized by Getulio. He is debased verbally, physically, and mentally. Getulio fixates upon this sacrificial lamb and projects all his hatred upon this "creature," this "pox." He pulls out his teeth, ties him to trees, and berates him constantly. "The creature was gagged behind us groaning because of the pain on his gums, since the pliers were not the kind specifically for pull ing out teeth and they were rusty and slippery, so that the extrac tion was delayed and the gums almost came off with the teeth ..." (55). "Help me tie this thing to a tree. We're not going to untie him for his needs" (25). The victim is dragged across the sertäo like a package to be delivered. Only the village priest has any com passion for the man. He is, however, impotent to stop the Sergeant's cruelty or his mission; he can only alleviate the prisoner's suffering momentarily by placing a compress dipped in holy water on his bloody mouth. Symbolically, the victim is the true innocent at the mercy of a ruthless political system that is as unfathomable as it is unjust. From this perspective, the prisoner's life can be viewed in Kafkaesque terms as an absurd nightmare. The prisoner is the quintessential Job figure with punishment after punishment heaped upon him by 452 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">an irrational captor. " 'Do you happen to know a fancy word for pulling out teeth? Would you be so kind as to open your little daisy of a mouth quick? Dammit, damn you!' Then I turned my weapon around, pounded twice on the creature's lips and pulled out four teeth with the pliers, and stopped" (53). As Getulio, Amaro, and the prisoner continue on their journey, government soldiers, led by a young lieutenant, come to cancel the mission. Getulio is bound by his personal code of honor to deliver the "pox." It seems it is now politically expedient even for Getulio's boss to rescind his vendetta. This Getulio refuses to do: Besides, the chief told me to go look for this creature and I went, I caught him, brought him along, broke him and I am going to take him, even if the chief can no longer support me I will have taken the man and delivered him. It is necessary to deliver the animal. I deliver him and I say: Mission accomplished. . . . I will take this trash with me no matter what, I will get there and deliver him. Even if I burst. I want to see who is man enough in Aracaju to tell me I can't do it, because I am Getulio Santos Bezerra and my equal has not yet been born. (74) His sense of mission cannot be influenced, and it is against these government soldiers that Getulio's most violent act is committed. In a mythological accommodation of Perseus' beheading of Medusa, Getulio coldly cuts off the lieutenant's head: It's impossible to cut off a frog's head without cutting the whole rest of the body for lack of a neck, but as for the lieutenant, as soon as I had finished the beheading I was able to tie his head to the end of a piece of rope and swirl it around my own head . . . saying, "Look at his head, look at his head, whoever persists will end up like this too," and then I jerked the rope and threw the head in the middle of the force. . . . (68) This act of inhumanity and defiance was triggered by an insult to Getulio's manhood. " 'Maybe,' the lieutenant said. 'But when you are in the company of a sergeant who is a cuckold and a deserter with a queer for a driver, I cannot very well believe that' " (65). Throughout the extended monologue the reader perceives that part of the reason for Getulio's anger emanates from his having been betrayed by his wife. "The pain of being a cuckold, a deep pain in the chest, something draining your strength from inside. I don't even know how to say it. A woman is not like a man" (34). He tells of past tendernesses but quickly implies that he killed his wife and .his unborn child for a supposed act of infidelity. "But I said nothing and when I plunged the iron, I closed my eyes. She made no sound. She fell there, with her hands on her belly" (35). Much of Sergeant Getulio's tone is somber and humorless; the horror of disquisitions on methods of murder and torture seems endless, evoking a strong feeling of reader disgust. Getulio's being JOAO UBALDO RIBE1RO 453</page><page sequence="6">is permeated with Schadenfreude. This perverse delight is Getulio's overriding passion. In his choice of a woman he selects his mirror image, Luzinete, a larger-than-life reflection of himself. "She is one devil of a big woman, two armlengths of a woman from top to bottom, seventy-five kilos of genuine woman well measured . . ." (94). She equals his thirst for brutality and impels him to complete his mission. "Luzinete said, 'And why don't you finish all those accursed people once and for all and go on with your mission?' " (118). She is as accepting of violence as a natural state as he is. Her death and that of Amaro leave Getulio truly alone. Ribeiro's tale is marked as well with strong psychological con cerns. The work is framed only by Getulio's perceptions of reality, and, as such, these perceptions are at times lyrically poignant and, at others, mask the rambling convictions of a madman. Getulio is now obsessed with completing his mission. Although his tales of violence may be compelling, the effect of his extended monologue is that Getulio is a true grotesque of nature, a bestial aberration: Over twenty people to my credit, imagine, it's like women, impossible to remember them all. The first one is the most difficult, but after that you learn not to look at the face so as not to bungle the job. When you're too close it's no good. They grab at you, they pull your jacket down. (14) Symbolically, he has now turned on the same political system that had so frequently used him in the past. One of the keys to an understanding of this "tale of virtue" is that the reader is able to see through the constant and twisted philosophizing, perceiving a being, like Dostoevsky's unnamed nar rator, whose imagination impels him to exaggerate the slightest in sult or feeling of inferiority. Unlike his Russian counterpart, Getulio, however, never considers the consequences of his actions. He is as impulsive as his parallel consciousness is inert. Both men are totally out of step and at variance with the tenor and tenets of their times. The antiintellectualism of Getulio is largely attributable to envy and incomprehension. He is amazed that his companion Amaro is able to remember the words to popular songs and prayers. He loathes the prisoner because he has had a high school education. Getulio dwells upon that fact throughout the novel: You went to high school, you went to high school! a high school never made a man out of a bum, and don't answer because it's better for you, I'll stick your head in a straw bag and leave the rest to the wild dogs. . . . (24) 454 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">It is an antirationalism born of a being unable to fathom the people and place around him: I want to take a very long look at Aracaju, nursing my anger and thinking about life and wondering what so many people are doing there, piled up on those big streets. When I speak nobody there understands, when someone speaks there I don't understand. (134)5 Getulio is only at home on the sertäo, for he senses his own limita tions. "I memorize very little, being a man of little learning, but if I had more learning I would memorize more verses, because I enjoy them and everybody enjoys them" (32). Of Amaro's death he observes: "If it weren't for his being a man, I would miss him" (33). His animal nature, however, is continually underscored as he remarks of a simple checker game: "I will never figure that out. I have no patience to keep studying these pieces on this board, it heats up one's head, it has no purpose" (77). A comparison of the thematic stance underlying the motif of the "stone wall" in Notes from Underground may help to clarify the scope and significance of Ribeiro's vision. Dostoevsky's narrator remarks: "Of course, I won't be able to breach this wall with my head if I'm not strong enough. But I don't have to accept a stone wall just because it's there and I don't have the strength to breach it" (99). Dostoevsky's underground man, in considering all the con sequences of his actions, is rendered immobile and withdraws into a solipsistic realm of his own spiteful consciousness. Getulio, on the other hand, the man of direct action, proceeds into the waiting militia. His sense of self is engendered by his life as a sergeant and the fear that that position instills in others. "The worst thing is to be nobody . . ." (119). This pride leads him to seek his own immortality in the completion of his near-impossible mission. Thus, he knowingly advances directly toward certain death. In the novel's concluding chapter Ribeiro's narrative tone becomes lyrical and mythic as Getulio's epic journey is nearing an end. The hero is being made ready for his apotheosis. Witness the psychic transformation of Getülio's being: "I think, well then, that man you sent out is no longer that man. I used to be him, now I am I" (133). In completing this mission Getulio has been transformed from a man at odds with his own world to one whose 'From a sociopolitical perspective, one could argue that Getülio's bestiality is bom of political failing, extreme poverty, and a lack of education. Jorge Amado in his Afterword observes that Ribeiro's novel, due to its "deep knowledge of the language spoken by the people," has "the capacity to reach the class of readers who are really interested in deep social changes" (140). It is the contention of this study that this novel transcends a purely sociological and political reality, acquiring also a mythical and ontological significance. JOAO UBALDO RIBEIRO 455</page><page sequence="8">sense of will and purpose is carried beyond life itself. The mythic qualities of the last chapter are formidable. "I used to be him and now I am I. I will say this with my eyes on his eyes and will leave you there tied and toothless, and with my ash face and with my woman in the moon ..." (133). In this anthropomorphic transfiguration, Getulio becomes one with the earth of the sertâo: This I have, this whole land I have, because I was given birth by the land through a hole in the ground and I came out in the middle of hot smoke and she will bear others like me, because this land is the greatest breeder in the whole world. (134) And I being I, being I, when I was a boy I ate clay and entered the ground eating clay, shitting clay and eating again. . . . (136) My ash face, my hair of earth, my leather boot, my iron gun, huh creature? aren't we all the same? not much so now because I am I, Getulio Santos Bezerra and my name is a verse which is always going to be versed and if there is a moon out it glows and if the sun is out it burns the face. . . . (135) Within this cosmic at-one-ment with the life force of nature Ribeiro disorders prosaic reality as he metamorphosizes Getulio into a primitive emanation of pure will that endures in the dry lands of the Northeast. "I live everywhere. I live walking. Ay, aaaaaaaaay, aay, aay, ay, ay, aaaaaaaaay, aaaay, ay, a clay bull, ay a clay bull . . ." (27). Getulio's being remains only as a resonant image of a totally new mythic configuration. "I am now covered with clay like this and I eat of the clay as though it were food, because of the brown taste" (27). The violent will of this hellish creature is now transfigured into the clay of the backlands. He is the eternal clay bull. The novel ends with a montage of verbal exclamations, words run together, but Getulio's will persists, as do his final thoughts, "claybull claya-ay a-ay a-ay ayapan nierfull of clay and lifel am I and will and who was ay mywiltedo rangetree ay hey I will and carry out and do and" (137). Considered within this mythic perspec tive, Getulio's dream of populating these dry lands of Sergipe with an army of violent sons serves as a prophetic warning. "I would give them real male names and after that we would take these lands around here and we would organize some troops with more men and we would be masters of the world here ..." (107). Narrative ly, his dream becomes a Brazilian tall tale of vengeance. This theme of one man's anger—"I get angry inside, it seems I have a need to be angry" (34)—is subjoined to the motif of the innate anger and violence of an animistic sertäo. An apocalyptic warning is tendered on the final words of Chapter Six. "You see the kind of son I have? Invincible" (109). It is at this juncture of the novel 456 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">that Ribeiro masterfully comingles the art of the modern-day mythmaker with, in Jorge Amado's words, "a persistent concern with exposing both individual and social problems" (139). Joäo Ubaldo Ribeiro's modern hero Getulio has broken through the barriers of his own deformed soul to find redemption in death.6 Freed from its purely Christian connotation, the archetype of redemptive suffering is applicable to Getulio's death in the service of his successfully completed mission. He is transfigured and redeemed through his willingness to accept death "... in the pro cess of a transcendent value, a worthy end ..." (Dillistone 22). Only by means of this willed death can he be reborn within the soil of backlands, rejuvenating it with his force and vitality. He is finally able to state: "I can cry now, because I feel like crying . . (136).7 Getulio's spiritual corfiingling with the clay of the Brazilian sertäo perpetuates his will, a forceful will that is needed for future political and social change. He affirms: "I am «dive in Hell ..." (136). He is now eternal, forming a coalescence with all that is bestial and chthonic. Like Jerome S. Bruner's observa tion in "Myth and Identity," Ribeiro, through the conscious use of mythological correspondences, "externalize[s] the daemon where it can be enmeshed in the texture of aesthetic experience ..." (279). As Amado concludes: "Among the mass of books published in Brazil in the last ten years, Sergeant Getulio stands out as one of the few works contributing to the development of a literary art that is gen uinely Brazilian" (141). Out of one man's epic quest for redemp tion, Ribeiro has fashioned one of the most complex and compel ling Brazilian novels of the present age. 'See Ziolkowski 3-54. One of Ziolkowski's key points regarding the archetypal redemptive suffering is that the suffering must be willed. The character must accept suffering and even death in the service of achieving a value or goal. The act of crying transcends a merely psychological indication that the hero has changed. It acquires the mythic symbolism of an act of consecration and preparation for death and resurrection. JOAO UBALDO RIBEIRO 457</page><page sequence="10">WORKS CITED Angelo, Ivan.
