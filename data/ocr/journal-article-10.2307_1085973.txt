Cambridge University Press; Toronto: Macmillan Company of Canada. 1952. Pp. viii, 271. ($4.75) THE fragments that remain from the works of the early Greek philoso- phers appear, at first sight, to be as wildly dogmatic as they are un- happily brief; for one thinker finds the first principle of nature to be water, another air, a third fire, while yet a fourth declares it to be an unlimited something that is nothing in particular. And yet it is impossible that philosophy can have begun as a series of random guesses, however imprudent the earliest speculations may seem to be. The idea that the world has an intelligible nature is implicit in these assertions, and the question "What is this nature?" is the seed from which Greek philosophy is to grow: somehow it ought to be possible to discover the kind of investigations that the Greeks pursued and the form of experience to which they appealed in giving answers to the question that they were the first to ask. It used to be said that these thinkers, since they concerned themselves with "physics," were in reality natural scientists, who attempted, by the criticism of the results of observations and experiments, to achieve a sound empirical knowledge of things. Anticipations of the current hypo- theses and methods of modern science were eagerly sought for, and found, even in the most unscientific contexts. For example, Empedocles, though admittedly given to superstitious and magical practices, was also repre- sented as a sober man of science who, by his experiments with the water- clock, put Nature to the question and forced her to reveal her secrets. The first principles of these early physicists were similarly rationalised. The Unlimited of Anaximander was variously interpreted as spatially infinite, qualitatively undetermined, or a simple mixture; Anaximander did indeed think of it as divine, but in a "non-religious" sense. If this view is now propounded less often or more cautiously, very much of the credit for the change is due to the late F. M. Cornford. Since the publication in 1912 of his highly influential book, From Religion to Philosophy, Cornford has insisted in his writings that it is not sufficient to study the questions expressly asked or the answers expressly given by these philosophers; in addition, it is necessary to look into the opinions which they took for granted, and the pattern of these presuppositions, if it could be reconstructed, would form that "unconscious philosophy" which combines with explicit thought in the formation of a man's mind. 20 THE PHOENIX, Vol. 10 (1956) 1.</page><page sequence="2">PRINCIPIUM SAPIENTIAE 21 Once these tacit assumptions were discovered it would be seen that the early philosophers imagined a concrete picture of the world, which could be traced to its origin in religious ideas; and such abstract terms as "unlimited," "time," and "space" would be found to have, for example, the particular connotation of circularity. In order to sketch the picture of the world that dominated the imagi- nation of the early Greeks, Cornford had recourse to the poets, and particularly Hesiod. Before interpreting them, however, it was necessary to understand more primitive ways of thought such as were being studied by the anthropologists. Here Cornford made much use of the concept of "mana," which he connected with the Greek ojwpa and 68a,6s, and of the theory of "collective representations" which, according to Durkheim and L6vy-Bruhl, form the unnoticed structure of primitive thought. Later he was drawn to Jung's theory of the "collective unconscious," because it appeared to provide a source for the images of which myth- ology consists and with which philosophy begins. Principium Sapientiae, which contains Cornford's last thoughts on this subject, was left uncompleted at his death and has been prepared for publication by Professor W. K. C. Guthrie, who has added in an appendix a brief, but very useful, summary of the argument of the second part. The decision to publish the manuscript was right, for the book, although unfinished at a number of points, exhibits often the illumination and grace of Cornford's best writing. He begins, surprisingly but effectively, with Epicurus, whose dogmatic confidence in the atomic theory is attributed, after Bailey, not to any possible kind of sensation, but to a self-evident intuition. This appre- hension or projection (~irpoXt) of the mind is shown to be inconsistent with a properly empirical science, such as medicine, and yet to be essential to early Greek philosophy. Cornford assumes that the source of this non- empirical knowledge must be religion, and proceeds to discover it (by the help of some good interpretation of Platonic texts) in persons who perform, in a single capacity, the functions of seer, poet, and sage. Such were Orpheus, Abaris, Aristeas, and Salmoxis in ancient Greece and those who, in other places and at other times, have exhibited the mantic powers of prophecy, wisdom, and song that nowadays go by the name of shamanism. In the following chapters Cornford deals with the separation of these three functions, with much admirable comment on Plato and his predecessors. There follow two chapters which form the heart of the book: they are entitled "Anaximander's System" and "Pattern of Ionian Cosmogony." The discussion of Anaximander is the best that is known to me, and contains a good deal that is enlightening on the Unlimited and nature. The tacit assumptions of the Milesian cosmogonies are now made explicit: first there is a primal unity, from which in turn the oppo- sites and the great elemental masses are separated, and these then</page><page sequence="3">22 THE PHOENIX combine to form individual things. This formula is next discovered in cosmogonic myths in Diodorus Siculus, Euripides, the Orphic myths, and (less clearly) in Hesiod's Theogony: in these accounts it is assumed (to put it in an excessively simple form) that Earth and Heaven were originally one, that their separation left a yawning gap (Chaos) between them, that Eros then symbolises the reunion of Earth and Heaven or,. in prosaic terms, the interaction of the intermediate elements that governs the movements of the world. This semi-philosophical account of the creation given by Hesiod at Theogony 116ff. is followed by a purely mythical tale beginning at 132, in which the earlier account is duplicated, but in a more anthropomorphic form: so also in Genesis a comparatively abstract version of the creation (1-2.3) precedes a more concrete story (2.4 ff.) containing more of the atmosphere of myth. In Hesiod's second story the castration of Ouranos is "a very ancient mode of conceiving the first act in cosmogony, the separation of Heaven and Earth to provide the male and female parents of all life" and "this cosmogonical myth must have its ultimate source in a ritual practised in pre-agricultural times to promote the fertility of men and animals" (213). A third and even more primitive tale, which serves as the sequel of the second, is next reconstructed from scattered incidents in the Theogony to form the life story of Zeus. This story, which Hesiod preserved only in fragments because it was no longer understood in his time, combines a cosmogony with the institution of a social order. Cornford next turns to the critical question of the relation between cosmogonical myth and ritual. He rejects the view, put forward by Frazer and others, that the myth is in origin a merely fanciful account of the annual transformation of nature, and that the creation of the world is then conceived on the analogy of this change and the myth invested with a cosmological significance. Instead, he follows Professor S. H. Hooke in arguing that the origin of these myths is to be found, not in the specu- lations of savages about the beginning of the world, but in ritual, and in particular the ritual of the Babylonian New Year Festival: "the core of the whole festival is evidently the renewal of the life of nature by the death, resurrection, and marriage of the fertility spirit, embodied in the King;" but because the King is the centre of the ritual the emphasis falls on its social function, which is the maintenance of the social order and the preservation of the people, for the social order "extends outwards to embrace the cosmos." As the ceremonies were repeated year after year, they naturally out- lasted their celebrants and inevitably a distinction came to be made between the function and the man who performed it, the function being related to him "somewhat as the timeless Platonic idea is related to the many particulars which embody it in time." The function, consisting of magical powers, "acquires an archetypal or paradigmatic character.</page><page sequence="4">PRINCIPIUM SAPIENTIAE 23 The divinity of the King becomes a god on the supernatural plane, and his official action is 'idealized' into an exploit of that god. The relation of cause and effect is now reversed. The narrative of the god's exploit becomes an aetiological myth. We are told that the human king carries out his yearly duties as the representative on earth of his divine proto- type, the incarnation or 'son' of the god. He renews the physical and social order every spring because the god instituted that order; and the action of the god, from being properly timeless and universal, comes to be a unique historical event located 'in the beginning'. Such is the process whereby the New Year ritual generates the cosmogonical myth" (237- 238). Finally, a comparison between the story of Zeus, as reconstructed from Hesiod, and the Babylonian Hymn to Marduk yields sufficient similarities to permit Cornford to argue that the former is derived ulti- mately from the latter, having been transmitted, perhaps, by way of Ugarit and Crete. In the case of a book of such extraordinary scope it is insufficient, though it may be useful, to make particular criticisms, whereas to write a general appreciation would require a committee of experts or (more likely) another Cornford. Nevertheless, the historian of early Greek thought may feel, for example, that the author is less critical of the doxographic evidence that he ought to be: for he concludes from Hippo- lytus' testimony (Ref. 1.14.2) about Xenophanes that God is the world, and hence, as God is eternal, cosmogony is impossible. But Hippolytus does not say that Xenophanes thought God was the world and what he does say is merely an example of the practice, common after Plato, of treating Xenophanes as if he were an Eleatic. Again, it is true to say (149) that Heraclitus regarded all human values as relative, but not that, in his view, the "life which animates the world is indifferent" to them, for the one divine law is the nurse of all human laws. Finally, Cornford has some good remarks on the difference between the cosmogony of Theogony 116 if. and that of 132 ff., but he is not able to explain how in the former passage Chaos, which is supposed (rightly, I think) to have been in origin the gap opened by the separation of Heaven from Earth, comes into being before the Earth, and therefore before the separation (Theogony 126-128). He distinguishes (195-198) between the primaeval Heaven and the starry Heaven, which arose later out of the Earth, and finds in the birth of Aether and Day the first letting-in of light. But it is noteworthy that Erebus and Night are the first-born of Chaos, and Aether and Day are born from them; and that Euripides' Aether is later (198) identified, not with the light let in by the original separation, but with the starry Heaven. It seems likely that Cornford's thought on this point was still in flux at the time of his death: notice the somewhat clearer account given in his essay, "A Ritual Basis for Hesiod's Theogony," published in The Unwritten Philosophy (Cambridge 1950).</page><page sequence="5">24 THE PHOENIX In general, it may be said that the antithesis of empiricism is made too sharply, although it is convincingly used in refuting errors made by those who rely, for their interpretations, on the analogy of modern science. In particular, Hippocrates, who is taken as the type of empiricism, makes (Progn. 1) the claim to knowledge of the past, the present, and the future that .Cornford regards, no doubt rightly, as typical of dogmatism. Above all, one would have liked a fuller statement of what is meant by the "rationalisation" of the shaman's intuition. Is this really a different kind of intuition which, however, makes the same kind of claim to certainty as the shaman's rapt vision? Or is it the same thing in rational dress? Cornford's account of the Babylonian myth of creation and its in- fluence on Greek thought must be left for others to judge, and it may be that the theories upon which he has built his last book will prove no more permanent than those of the French sociologists with which he began. However that may be, this book gives the best account, to my mind, of the development of myth from its beginnings to its place in "the unwritten philosophy." It ought, therefore, to be of importance for what it says, not only about the origins of philosophy, but also about the actual course of early Greek thought; for, although the book is not directly concerned with the critical function of philosophy, it reminds us that the analogies that underlie the constructions of early thought are likely to be primitive. That is a great service and one that the author had an unequalled capacity to perform. On that ground alone this de- serves to be called a good book; it would not be Cornford's if it were not often beautiful and wise as well.</page></plain_text>
