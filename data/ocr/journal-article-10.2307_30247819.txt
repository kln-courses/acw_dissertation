<plain_text><page sequence="1">KIVA Journal of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society, Inc. Vol. 37 Fall 1971 Number 1 EXCAVATIONS AT BETATAKIN AND KEET SEEL KEITH M. ANDERSON SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY ABSTRACT Recent excavations in the Middens at Betatakin and Keet Seel, together with material excavated at Keet Seel in 1934, complement recent tree-ring analysis of these two villages. Ceramics from Betatakin comprise a typical Tsegi Phase profile, as expected from the post-A.D. 1260 tree-ring dates. Pottery from the Keet Seel midden indicates three periods of occupation: 1) a Pueblo I occupation dating from approximately A.D. 950 to A.D. 1050; 2) a Pueblo II occupation from approximately A.D. 1050 to A.D. 1150; and 3) the standing village of Keet Seel, dating from A.D. 1250 to A.D. 1290, Stratified deposits in the Keet Seel midden are tentatively correlated with the development of the 13th century village. Rim form attributes suggest innovations during this period which may be due to immigration into the village. Rim forms, gray ware decoration and sandal types suggest cultural separation between the two villages; it is suggested that this separation relates to differences in regional affiliation, community structure, religious institutions and village distributions within the canyon. Keet Seel apparently has Mesa Verde connections lacking in Betatakin; on the basis of recent Tsegi Phase studies, it is suggested that the villages relate to two separate intercommunity networks in the Tsegi Canyon system. INTRODUCTION This report presents the results of excavations in middens below the thirteenth century Kayenta villages of Betatakin and Keet Seel. The purpose of excavation was to provide cultural data on the occupation of these two villages, which would supplement an intensive tree-ring study by Jeffrey S. Dean (1969, 1970). Dean's analysis has provided a micro-historical sequence which showed that Batatakin and Keet Seel were built and abandoned within a 50 year period, but had different settlement sequences. By comparison of I</page><page sequence="2">population growth and architectural features, Dean inferred significant differences between the two villages in social organization and integration, which governed their distinctive patterns of growth and development. Keet Seel, the longer-lived (ca. A.D. 1250-1290) and larger of the two sites, apparantly grew by accretion and periodic immigration, and evidences more heterogeneity of architecture and household blocks than Betatakin, which was occupied for a significantly shorter span (ca. A.D. 1267-1290). Since these villages were excavated long before Dean's study, it has not been possible to obtain artifact samples from the village rooms to test whether Keet Seel showed cultural evidence of immigration or more cultural variability than Betatakin. However, middens were preserved below both villages; the author performed salvage excavation in these deposits in 1964 and 1965. This report is an exploratory treatment of the material from these middens. In addition, some information is included from 1911-1919 excavations in Betatakin by Byron Cummings and the 1934 C.W.A. excavation of Keet Seel by Irwin Hayden. Objectives of analysis were: 1. To obtain information independent of tree-ring data concerning the periods of occupation in the caves; 2. To determine if the depositional sequence in the village middens conformed to the sequence of village construction and growth outlined by Dean on the basis of architecture and dendrochronology; 3. To test for change expressed by pottery types and selected attributes during the 50-year period in which these villages were occupied; 4. To test for cultural similarities and differences between these villages which might provide clues to structural and historical differences between them. GEOGRAPHIC AND HISTORICAL SETTING The villages are located in Tsegi Canyon, a well-known feature of the Colorado Plateau province. The Tsegi is a tortuous gorge with a maximum depth of over 1000 feet. Down the canyon floor flows a perennial stream, Laguna Creek. Although water now flows on or near bedrock, frequently with steep high banks, in the thirteenth century the canyon floor was probably bedded with alluvial fill across which a permanent stream meandered (Hack 1945:156; Cooley 1962:48, Figure 18.1). Potential for gardening near sheltered alcoves with ready access to water provides sufficient reason for a sudden migration into the canyon, beginning in A.D. 1250. Ultimately, the canyon had a total population of perhaps 700 people (Dean 1970:152). Tsegi Canyon is only one of several regions which were subject to the thirteenth century convergence of Kayenta Anasazi populations; others were 2</page><page sequence="3">Navajo Canyon, Rainbow Plateau and Longhouse Valley. This period, the Tsegi Phase, represents an abrupt change in settlement and community patterns, marked by the appearance of large villages, often built on eminences adjacent to arable land and settlements shifting from downstream locations to upstream portions of canyons with continuously flowing water sources. Prior to this, Kayenta villages had been small and dispersed, concentrated in areas of best land. Between 1150 and 1225, regions to the north and northwest were abandoned "partly because of changing climatic conditions and erosion and possibly in some areas in response to Mesa Verde movements westward and possible Shoshonean pressures from the northwest" (Lindsay et al. 1968:364-5). Whatever the nature of population relationships in the area north of Tsegi Canyon, it is clear that Mesa Verde groups were in close contact with Kayenta villages in the San Juan Triangle, and in the Kayenta region proper (Lindsay 1969, Lipe 1970). BETATAKIN AND KEET SEEL RUINS Betatakin is the second largest cliff-dwelling in Tsegi Canyon and contains 135 rooms (Figure 1). Located in a southwest tributary of Tsegi Canyon, about five miles from Marsh Pass, the village fills the base of a huge alcove in the Navajo Sandstone. Dean's study of village architecture and 133 datable wood specimens shows that although wood had been cut and deposited in the cave in the 1250's, the first rooms were not built until 1267, when at least three families arrived. From 1275 through 1277 there was a sharp rise in population, with the addition of at least ten new room clusters. Dean interprets Betatakin's growth in this early period as immigration of a group comprising a single integrated community whose movement was planned and coordinated. Population then increased gradually to a peak of 125, in the mid-1280's. This later growth suggests natural population growth, perhaps households estab- lished by newly married couples (Dean 1969:76-84). There are no cutting dates after 1286. Keet Seel, with at least 160 rooms, is the largest Tsegi Phase cliff-dwelling (Figure 2). It occupies two levels in a wide, low alcove. Most rooms rest on sandstone ledges in the back of the cave, and on a man-made platform of fill packed behind a masonry wall along the front of the northwest portion of the cave. The lower floor of the cave is sand, upon which a few rooms were constructed and on which trash accumulated. Keet Seel, like Betatakin, has a final cutting date of A.D. 1286, but construction of Keet Seel was begun seventeen years earlier, at about A.D. 1250. A few dates in the village predate this occupation, including cutting dates of A.D: 950 and A.D. 1209, but these come from wood salvaged from previous occupations of the cave. The only architectural evidence of an earlier 3</page><page sequence="4">"V, , - ~ TRENCH 2 n~ ~ TRENCH IO ` p PaP~ BETA 0 FET 5 Figure 1.

Keet Seel and Midden Excavations 4</page><page sequence="5">occupation in the cave is a circular slab-lined structure uncovered on the lower level of the site in 1934. Keet Seel has more variety in architecture than Betatakin, and more periods of population expansion. Construction began in the south end of the cave and moved northeast and outward. By 1272 there were twelve room clusters (living rooms with associated courtyards and storage rooms) and a population of about 60. During a second period of expansion, ending in 1275, five more households appeared, bringing the population to 80. By this time a long retaining wall across the northeast portion of the cave was completed. Fill behind the wall provided a platform upon which the village could expand. From 1276 to 1282 four more households were established, bringing the population to 100 or 125. After this, some room clusters were abandoned and some living rooms were converted to granaries, but the population increased slightly, reaching a maximum of 125 to 150 by A.D. 1286. Village development suggests population growth by immigration and accretion, with no evidence of stock-piling of timbers as at Betatakin (Dean 1969:85-150). BETATAKIN TRAIL SALVAGE The slope below Betatakin is unstable talus of sand and sandstone rubble, and contains only a few shallow pockets of debris from the occupation of Betatakin. In 1964 and 1965 the trail below Betatakin was extended and enlarged. To salvage cultural deposits threatened by trail construction, surface collections were made and several small trenches were excavated, producing a small sample of perishable material and 1,877 sherds. The pottery sample is probably not perfectly representative of Betatakin ceramics, since visitors to the ruin have undoubtedly taken many souvenir sherds over the last 60 years. An unusually low proportion of painted types may be a reflection of this. Furthermore, the debris in front of Betatakin may contain backdirt from Byron Cummings' and Neil Judd's early excavations. Cummings may have dug in the midden, since he states in his 1909 field notes that he "first shoveled over all the debris at the bottom of the cliff" before excavating the ruin (Arizona Pioneer Historical Society 1908-1909:44). Excavation was confined to three areas: (1) Trench 1, a curving trench on the west side of the slope; (2) a thin trash deposit below Room 42 in the center of the cave; and (3) Trench 2, which began below Room 46 and extended east to a curve in the trail below Room 75. A transverse profile of Trench 1 is shown in Figure 3. On the slope surface (Layer 1) lay a three-inch mantle of loose red sand and sandstone rubble. Between this and the Kayenta formation were three layers of debris. The uppermost (Layer 2) was fine, fluffy gray-brown soil, up to 16 inches thick, which was found only in the upper two and one-half feet of the trench. Below this lay two and one-half to 12 inches of heavily matted trash 5</page><page sequence="6">- , .... ..

Profile: Betatakin Midden consisting of twigs, corncobs, and cornhusks (Layer 3). Layer 4 was fluffy- gray soil, with some layering, two to 15 inches thick; this rested on Kayenta clay. Excavation here, as in the rest of the trail salvage, was done without screening, but the midden debris was turned over carefully with shovel and trowel before being discarded. East of Trench 1 the Kayenta formation was bare except for a thin mantle of trash two feet downslope from the cliff. This deposit, nine feet wide and 22 feet long, had a maximum thickness of six inches, and consisted of dark brown dust containing reeds, twigs, shredded juniper bark and charcoal. In Trench 2 three depositional layers were exposed in 24 inches of fill. The top layer, up to eight inches thick, was composed of twigs, juniper bark, and loosely-packed organic material with a few sandstone spalls lying on its surface. Below this were about 12 inches of gray soil, containing charcoal, Oregon grape leaves, and other organic material. This rested on a layer of hard-packed moist red sand streaked with ash. 6</page><page sequence="7">The rest of the sample from Betatakin comes from general surface collection and from material picked up during trail construction. Since comparison of sherds from different trenches and strata of the midden shows no significant distributional differences, pottery types are totalled and treated as a single sample representing the period from A.D. 1267 to A.D. 1290 (Table 1). This pottery is a typical Tsegi Phase profile, which occurs in thirteenth century sites elsewhere in the Kayenta region. Index types included in this profile include Kayenta Black-on-white, Tusayan Polychrome (style B), Tsegi Black-on-orange, and Kayenta Polychrome (Lindsay 1969:286). The pottery collected by Judd in 1917 (Judd 1930:67-70), which the author examined at the Smithsonian, is also of these types, with the addition of sherds of Tsegi Corrugated, a fifth index type of the Tsegi Phase. Consequently, the pottery from Betatakin is in accord with the post-A.D. 1267 tree-ring dates. TABLE 1.

Deep cultural deposits below the main village had been exposed by a 1934 C.W.A. excavation, directed by Irwin Hayden and John Wetherill (Figure 2). The records and artifacts from the excavation, stored at the Museum of Northern Arizona, include a profile of this trench 7</page><page sequence="8">(Figure 4) and the 1934 field notes, with a description of the fill and the artifacts found. The trench was four feet wide, had a maximum length of 16 feet eight inches, and was dug in arbitrary levels. The contents and fill of these levels, recorded in 1934, are as follows: Level 1 1-40 inches deep. Fill: sand mixed with charcoal, apparently from hearth waste and burnt brush. Contents: sherds, squash stems, corncobs. Level 2 10 inches deep. Fill: soil not described. Part of the bottom of this level was "hard Pan". Part was covered with about four inches of organic litter, including bark, sticks, ashes, turkey droppings, feathers, corncobs, and squash rinds. Contents: sherds, corncobs, sandal, cloth, squash stems, bone, "ties", miscellaneous. Level 3 10 inches deep. Fill: part consisted of moist earth. Charcoal found throughout. Some sandstone boulders at bottom. Contents: sherds.. Level 4 10 inches deep. Fill: moist earth, with scattered charcoal. A lens of charcoal two to four inches thick was contained in the fill near the cliff. Contents: sherds, fragment of human skull, canid jaw. Level 5 12 inches deep. Fill: sand. Contains a lens of "steel gray sand", three inches thick -and 15 inches long, four feet from the cliff face. Contents: sherds, flaked stone, squash rinds. Level 6 12 inches deep. Fill: sand, containing strips of charcoal two to six inches thick, from which come most of the sherds from this level. Contents: sherds, flaked stone, bone, human hair, fragment of human skull, squash rind. a-w ORGANIC LITTER SAND 0 FEET 5 CHARCOAL SORGANIC ' LITTE SAND' CHARCOAL Figure 4.

Level 8 12 inches deep. Fill: sand with charcoal throughout, except for layer of red sand three to four inches thick extending across most of the midden. Contents: sherds, one burnt bone.

Lower portion contains "oozy dark sand" with charcoal. Water was struck at the bottom of the trench, near the cliff face. Contents: sherds, chipped stone flakes. Other than the debris capping the surface, the profile shows no distinct occupational layers in this part of the midden. The pottery from this excavation, still sacked in the original level bags, was made available by the Museum for study in 1967, and the pottery types for each level are shown in Table 2. Three periods of occupation are clearly evident. Levels 1 and 2 contain Pueblo III types almost exclusively, and Level 3 includes some Pueblo III types. Lower levels down to Level 8 contained Pueblo II sherds predominantly, though some Pueblo I sherds are included. In Levels 9 and 10 Pueblo I types predominate. Evidently the cave was first occupied late in Pueblo I times. This was followed by a more lasting Pueblo II settlement, after which the cave was abandoned. Some time later, in late Pueblo III, the cave was re-occupied for the third and final time. The profile in Figure 4 shows a layer of sand without charcoal or organic debris, indicating a break in occupation corresponding approximately to Level 7. Quite possibly this marks a separation between Pueblo I and Pueblo II occupations. The larger quantities of organic debris associated with the deep Pueblo II deposits suggest an intensive occupation of the alluvial alcove floor, perhaps associated with habitation or storage structures on the upper level. EXCAVATION IN 1964 In late September and early October of 1964, the author excavated a trash mound at the foot of the original hand-and-toe trail to the upper village level. The mound, about 65 feet long (north-south) and 27 feet wide, rose to a height of 11 feet above the cave floor, and is composed of debris from the upper cave. The purpose of excavation was to salvage the mound's contents from disturbance due to increasing visitor traffic into the ruin. After initial test trenches were cut in the edges of the midden, each definable depositional layer was separately stripped. Fill was not screened, but each stratum was carefully turned with a trowel. A column has been left at the north end of the midden for future excavation. 9</page><page sequence="10">TABLE 2.

The strata are described below: Stratum 1 Description: gray ash soil flecked with charcoal, 10 inches maximum thickness. In the second pit at this level there is brown greasy charcoal-flecked soil and sandstone rubble; 24 inches thick. Possibly these are not the same strata but both lie atop sterile sand and rock and are found below stratum 2. Contents: no artifacts or cultural debris. Interpretation: north segment is apparently natural cave floor deposit; the south portion probably contains hearth-waste, the earliest evidence of human occupation of the cave in the midden. Stratum 2 Description: orange sand and large pieces of sandstone rubble. The first artifact-bearing layer. Maximum thickness 26 inches. Contents: sherds, a few sticks, bone, feces, charcoal. Interpretation: either debris from an early occupation on the ledge above, or the first occupation on the floor of the cave. Tree-ring specimen: A.D. 714-816 vv. Stratum 3 Description: Fine brown sand four to eight inches thick. Contents: sherds, sticks, charcoal. No domesticated plant remains. Interpretation: wind-deposited sand; either swept from the rock ledge or a wind-blown mantle over the cave floor. Associated with the first occupation. Tree-ring specimens: A.D. 986-1032 vv, A.D. 786-861 vv. Stratum 4 Description: heavily packed layer of sandstone fragments, containing some charcoal and gray ash. Thickness two to 12 inches. Contents: sherds, miscellaneous perishable debris. No certainly associated domesticated plant remains. Interpretation: primary accumulation on cave floor or secondary deposit coming from occupation of upper cave floor. The first appearance of three Pueblo II period ceramic markers (Moenkopi Corrugated, Dogoszhi B/W, Tusayan B/R) comes with this layer. Stratum 5 Description: sterile red sand and sandstone rubble; maximum thickness 14 inches. Contents: no artifacts reliably associated with this stratum. Interpretation: accumulation of wind-deposited sand and natural cave fall during abandonment of cave; this represents a break in occupation between Pueblo II and Pueblo III periods. Stratum 6 Description: fine brown sand. Maximum depth was not recorded because the stratum was not completely excavated, but it was at least 24 inches thick. Rests on Stratum 5 and is overlain by Stratum 7. Restricted to within three feet of cliff. Contents: no artifacts reliably associated; some sherds, a piece of charcoal, a fragment of cordage, and a projectile point probably derived from overlying strata. 11</page><page sequence="12">Interpretation: wind-blown sand, possibly swept off cave floor, which may have settled during the same break in occupation as Stratum 5. Stratum 7 Description: a hard-packed, dense layer of brown soil, ash, and fine organic litter, with a maximum depth of 30 inches. At the south end this showed in profile a series of bedding lines representing several depositions, presumably compacted by foot-traffic. Five sub-strata, primarily discernible by difference in density, were: A. Fluffy gray-brown soil, four to six inches thick. B. Slightly more compact fluffy gray-brown soil, up to 10 inches thick. C. Layer of mixed ash, dirt, and organic litter, about six inches thick. D. Mat of organic litter mixed with ash, grading downward into moist sand. Maximum thickness of 12 inches. E. Brown compacted soil and ash. Also in Stratum 7 was sandstone rubble, including some dressed masonry tablets. Contents: sherds, bone, cotton cloth, corncobs, cornhusk wads, corn stems, squash seeds, stems, and rinds, yucca fiber and stems, cordage, knotted yucca strips, cactus, feces, feather blanket fragments, bark, sticks, sandals, hair, basket fragments, coiled basket-impressed fire-hardened adobe frag- ments, feathers, shredded bark, charcoal, pine cones, bone awl, and miscellaneous organic litter.

Typical Keet Seel Midden Profile 12</page><page sequence="13">Interpretation: litter from an extended occupation in the cave, probably mostly from the upper cave and probably, in part, the remains of a masonry structure or structures cleaned out of the cave floor during the first construction of Keet Seel. This stratum contains the first Pueblo III sherds which indicate that the layer was deposited with the first occupation of Keet Seel, about A.D. 1250. Stratum 8 Description: thin (four inches to 10 inches) layer of fluffy, gray-brown soil, overlying both strata 6 and 7 near the cliff face. Contains ash mixed with dirt and is compacted on the upper surface by foot-traffic. Restricted to southern part of midden, and extended only about six feet east from the cave wall. Contents: sherds, corncobs, bone, squash rind, cotton cloth, worked plant fiber, cactus, feathers, basketry fragments, twigs, and cactus bore. Interpretation: waste or sweepings from upper floor occupation, involving removal of previous occupations (Pueblo I and Pueblo II). Stratum 9 Description: thin layer of sand and rock rubble, primarily composed of building stone, resting above Strata 6 and 7 at the north end of the midden. Thickness six inches. Contents: sherds, cotton thread, squash rinds, corncob, small amount of miscellaneous plant material. Interpretation: residue either from (1) collapsed structure on upper floor, or (2) room construction debris cleaned from ledge floor. Mixture of earlier types (Pueblo I and Pueblo II) suggests removal of debris from pre-Tsegi Phase occupation. Stratum 10 Description: ash mixed with soil and organic litter; two to seven inches thick. Contents: sherds, bone, corncobs, squash rinds, stems, seeds, yucca stems and leaves, juniper bark, hair, cotton cloth, feces, feathers, bark, and miscellaneous organic debris. Interpretation: trash litter and housecleaning debris from occupation of upper cave. Stratum 11 Description: vegetable litter up to six inches deep. Contents: sherds, corncobs, husks, and stalks, quids, yucca leaves, twigs, sandal, bark, hairbrush, feather-cord blanket fragment, feces, feathers, bone, seeds, cotton cloth, cactus, squash fragments, and miscellaneous vegetable material. Interpretation: trash litter from upper cave. Stratum 12 Description: very hard-packed yellow-brown organic layer (turkey droppings?), about six inches thick, containing a relatively small amount of miscellaneous vegetable material. When broken, this caked material gave off a fine odorous dust. This layer rested on Stratum 7 in the north portion of the mound and some material from Stratum 7 may have been mixed with Stratum 12. Stratum 12 overlay Strata 9 and 10 and appears to have overlain Stratum 11. 13</page><page sequence="14">Contents: sherds, sticks, bone, corncobs, feces, squash rind, cotton cloth, feathers, fragment of feather-cord blanket, and miscellaneous vegetable material. Interpretation: this is primarily original trash deposition, rather than material cleaned or thrown from the upper cave. If it contains turkey droppings or similar offal, it was probably deposited while moist and packed soon after by foot-traffic. Stratum 13 Description: very dense and hard-packed layer of solid brown organic material, located at the foot of the hand-and-toe trail. Had the appearance of caked offal and was hard enough to require a pick in digging. Some of this layer was exposed before excavation of the midden. Maximum thickness was 22 inches. Contents: sherds, bone, seeds, feces, hair, piece of feather-cord blanket, corncobs, squash fragments, cotton cloth, feathers, and miscellaneous vegetable material. Interpretation: waste deposited at the foot of the trail and packed by foot traffic during the occupation of Keet Seel. Stratum 14 Description: gray ash and charcoal, up to 10inches maximum depth, and packed with potsherds, often large and discolored from ash. Contents: predominantly sherds, with a few stone artifacts, bone, and a few vegetable scraps. Interpretation: ash and debris from firing pottery, probably cleaned from upper cave.

Contents: sherds, bone, cotton cloth, corncobs, feces, feather-cord blanket fragments, squash rinds, pine cone, manos, and stone. Interpretation: trash litter, probably from upper cave. Stratum 16 Description: loose sandy mantle overlying the whole midden to a depth of four to six inches. Contents: sherds, bone, worked wood, hair, corncobs, squash fragments, twigs, cotton fiber, cord, cotton cloth, basket fragment, feces, bark, feathers, and miscellaneous organic debris. Interpretation: probably backdirt from previous excavation, material churned up from underlying strata, and wind-blown sand. This is the topmost layer of the midden and excavation was begun by clearing it away from the whole surface. The contents are mixed and had undoubtedly been picked over by tourists. INTERPRETATION OF THE MIDDEN DEPOSITS Cultural deposits in the midden are of three types: hearth waste, trash litter, and wall rubble. Stratum 14 appears to be hearth or kiln waste, and is almost pure ash packed with sherds, some of which are smudged and warped, and large enough to have been used to cover pots during firing. Most other midden strata represent simple garbage disposal and contain food remains, cloth scraps, pieces of wood, broken vessels, animal bones, broken and discarded bone and wood tools, worn-out baskets and sandals, and scraps of cord and string. Two layers (7 and 9) are primarily room rubble, probably from deliberate removal of collapsed or abandoned rooms from the ledge above. Both strata contain sandstone rubble and a number of dressed sandstone tablets typical of Kayenta masonry. Since neither layer covers or surrounds structures they are undoubtedly room debris from the upper level. Four major events are evident from the strata: 1. Initial brief occupancy of the cave indicated by a deposit of sand and sandstone rubble containing a few artifacts (Stratum 2) which rest on naturally deposited cave fill; 2. A break in occupation of the cave indicated by Strata 5 and 6, both natural deposits of sand and rock; 3. Re-occupation of the ledges above, apparently preceded by removing rubble from old rooms (Strata 7 and 9); 4. Intermittent garbage disposal and cleaning of the ledge floor during a period of continuous human occupancy of the cave, resulting in Strata 10 through 16. Distribution of pottery types for each Keet Seel stratum is given in Table 3. Sherds from the Keet Seel strata are only those having exact stratum 15</page><page sequence="16">provenience; hence the profile is based on 4,842 sherds out of a total of 10,624. Pottery types given in this profile are defined by Colton (1955, 56) and are discussed by Beals, Brainerd and Smith (1945). For the most part only standard types are listed in Table 3, although some categories represent variations or styles usually included under single types. Pueblo I, II, and III types are all present in the midden, and plain gray body sherds were not separated into Kana-a or Keet Seel Gray because they are not reliably distinguishable in many cases. "Kana-a Gray" includes only neck-banded sherds; a small number (41) of plain rim sherds (Keet Seel Gray) not included in Table 3 occurred only from Stratum 9 upward. Probably most plain gray sherds in these strata are of this Tsegi Phase type. Tusayan and Moenkopi Corrugated were distinguished by reference to the examples shown in Plate 28 in Beals, Brainerd and Smith (1945); Tusayan Corrugated includes all sherds with distinct repeated finger indentations. A number of sherds of Tusayan Corrugated were tabulated separately because they have an encircling zone of several adjacent unindented clapboard coils, usually three in number. Another category, "obliterated corrugated", includes sherds showing a corrugated exterior that has been carelessly and incompletely smoothed over. This would probably be classed by some workers as Keet Seel Gray (cf. Beals, Brainerd and Smith 1945: Plate 28, II,b). The Tusayan Black-on-white category includes: 1. Ticked lines (Beals, et al. 1945:Fig. 36, H-J, Fig. 39, B-e, Fig. 38, K; 2. Circular interlocking scrolls (Beals, et al. 1945:Fig. 36, E); 3. Open cross-hatchured design, named by Colton "Betatakin Black-on-white" (Colton 1955:Ware 8B, Type 8); 4. Hatchured design, with heavy solid border lines, a continuation of the style characteristic of Dogoszhi Black-on-white. The Kayenta Black-on-white category includes: 1. Broad lines or heavy black elements with little white showing in the interspaces, producing a "negative" design appearance; 2. Spurred triangles in a heavy negative design (Beals, et al. 1945:Fig. 42); 3. Interlocking flags and pendant flags, often making a "foot" design (Beals, et al. 1945:Fig. 41, A; Fig. 42, E); 4. The "mosquito-bar" design which is the most obvious and recognizable charac- teristic of Kayenta Black-on-white (Beals, et al. 1945: Fig. 45, C). "Tusayan Black-on-red/Keet Seel Black-on-red" includes the Dogoszhi variety of Tusayan Black-on-red and Keet Seel Black-on-red. "Tusayan/Citadel Polychrome" and "Tusayan/Cameron Polychrome" include sherds with design elements that first appeared on Citadel and Cameron Polychrome and persisted into Pueblo III times in Tusayan Polychrome. Sherds tabulated under these headings could be either the early or late types because the sherds do not clearly show how much exterior slip was present. 16</page><page sequence="17">TABLE 3.

The 1934 trench cut through primary deposits on the cave floor, approximately seven and one-half feet of which were accumulated during Pueblo I and Pueblo II occupations of the cave. Above this is four and one-half feet of more concentrated litter deposited during the late Pueblo III (Tsegi Phase) occupation of Keet Seel. This deposit, represented in Levels 1 and 2, accumulated at the same time the villagers periodically dumped trash and room rubble at the foot of the hand-and-toe trail forming Strata 9-15 of the trash mound. Because this trash included sweepings from old debris and collapsed rooms, probably cleared to make way for new construction, there resulted a nicely stratified sequence of discrete layers with mixed ceramic assemblages. The deposits in the upper levels (1 and 2) of the 1934 trench contained only sherds from the Pueblo III village. Earliest occupation of the cave is estimated at A.D. 950 to 1050. This is based on four tree-ring dates from charcoal fragments in the midden, and one re-used beam from the village above. From Stratum 2 comes a date of 714-816 vv; Stratum 3 had two specimens giving dates of 786-861 vv and 986-1050 vv, and a fragment below Stratum 5 dated 916-961 vv. A re-used specimen from a room of the village dates 905-950 rL (Bannister, et al., 1968:39). These dates correlate with the early levels in the mound (Strata 2-4) and the midden levels (9 and 10) in which Pueblo I pottery predominates over Pueblo II types. Subsequent Pueblo II occupation is best represented in Levels 4 through 8 of the 1934 excavation. The dates for pottery types (Breternitz 1966) in these levels indicate a span of occupation between A.D. 1050 and A.D. 1150. STRATA FROM THE 13th CENTURY VILLAGE Of the five pottery types consistently associated with sites of the Tsegi Phase (A.D. 1250-1290), Kayenta Black-on-white, Tusayan Polychrome (style B), Tsegi Black-on-orange, Kayenta Polychrome and Tsegi Corrugated (Lindsay 1969:286), all except Tsegi Corrugated appear in the upper strata (8-16) in the mound, and Levels 1 and 2 of the deep trench. Hence these levels are equated with the 13th century village. Physical characteristics of specific mound strata are tentatively correlated with events in the village growth. Above Stratum 9 there are no concentrated rock rubble deposits, and the midden consists almost entirely of garbage from the village. It is suggested that this was deposited after 1275, when the back of the cave ledge was occupied by rooms built behind retaining walls crossing the upper cave level (Dean 1969:138). At this time, and perhaps by 1272, all the naturally level 18</page><page sequence="19">floor space of the cave was in use, and any existing rubble in the cave floor would have been used for fill behind the retaining wall. The 1280 cutting date from Stratum 14 is consistent with this interpretation. However, lacking other dates, there is no basis for determining the interval of deposition of previous strata. Sherds of the same vessel have been identified from Strata 14 and 15, indicating that these are part of the same depositional event. If the inference is made that Stratum 9 marks the completion of the front retaining wall in Keet Seel, subsequent strata may be expected to show some evidence of migration into the village that Dean inferred from the village growth sequence. This migration is indicated by construction of numerous room clusters, enlargement or modification of six extant clusters, construc- tion of the retaining wall, and building of three kivas behind the wall (Dean 1969:138-140; 1970:160-1, Figure 14). It is to be expected that Strata 7 and 8 would differ in some cultural attributes from Strata 9 through 14, and some changes may be expected from Strata 9 to 14. Several types of change might be expected as evidence of immigrant households into the existing village: 1. If these households arrived from a distant area, they would be expected to bring significant numbers of non-local pottery types (i.e., non-Kayenta types); 2. The simultaneous occurrence of several ceramic attributes might be expected. Sharp quantitative change would be evident in particular styles or attributes, reflecting significant increase in number of potters bringing new stylistic patterns; 3. In upper levels an increased variety of ceramic attributes should reflect persistence of older attributes along with recent innovations as a consequence of heterogeneity of population. A small number of Mesa Verde types are the only non-local sherds identified; these occur first in Stratum 7 (Table 4). No sharp increases or unprecedented amounts of Mesa Verde types occur. A continuous though minor contact with the Mesa Verde area is thus indicated, which does not appear to reflect any sudden long-distance immigration. Pottery types were the primary unit of tabulation for this preliminary study. Changes in proportions of some types are evident, but these changes are gradual, and do not show the discrete changes expected from immigra- tion. Kayenta Black-on-white shows a later peak of popularity than Tusayan Black-on-white (Table 3), and the unslipped orange wares (red-on-orange, black-on-orange and undecorated orange) show a slight trend toward late popularity, which might be due to immigration. Stratum 14, shown by a tree-ring date to have been deposited about A.D. 1280, has the most representative Tsegi Phase ceramic profile from the midden. It is a good sample (1,527 sherds), probably from pottery firing discards, and it is reasonably certain that it was not disturbed by vandalism. This stratum shows peak popularity of Kayenta Black-on-white, Keet Seel Polychrome, and Tsegi 19</page><page sequence="20">TABLE 4.

Unprecedented occurrence of a number of stylistic attributes remains to be determined through detailed analysis of design elements. Only one class of stylistic element - rim form - was recorded for all types, and this class of elements does indicate change through time. Rim forms recorded for all types are shown in Figure 7. Forms A through I are found in painted bowls; forms J through S are found in gray ware jars. Bowl rims show a series of innovations, expressed as unprecedented occurrence, in the following sequence: Levell11: I Level 9: D, F, G Below Level 9: A Level 7 or below: B, C, E, H Il/ b c d e f 9 i p q Figure 7. Rim Forms 20</page><page sequence="21">The distribution of the rims in red ware (the most common "table" class) in strata of largest samples is shown in Table 5. These are combined under three basic categories - rounded direct, flaring, and facetted - in Table 6. This shows a marked increase in number of facetted rims, made by a straight-sided tool, in Stratum 14. Gray ware rims J-R show a similar late appearance of a few forms in upper levels: Level 14: R Level 10: M Level 9: N, O, Q, S Level 7: J, K, L, P One primary change is demonstrated in these gray ware rims; angled flaring rims appear first in Stratum 9 and above. This coincides with the introduction of Keet Seel Gray. Table 7 shows the distribution of these gray ware rims in strata having the best samples. It should be noted that Betatakin rims are all from the type Keet Seel Gray. Keet Seel strata include both plain gray and corrugated jars in Strata 9 through 14; Stratum 7 includes only corrugated rims. This small sample suggests the occurrence of new rim forms in the later occupation (post-A.D. 1275) of Keet Seel, together with a wider variety of TABLE 5.

It also suggests a divergence of stylistic elements between Betatakin and Keet Seel since a number of rim forms appear late in Keet Seel which are not present in the contemporary sample from Betatakin. A review of other cultural elements of the two villages shows that this is not the only point of divergence between them, and suggests that they may have drawn upon two disparate populations. INTERVILLAGE COMPARISONS Betatakin and Keet Seel share the same types of pottery, sandals, and basketry. However, there is some evidence, in relative frequency of types and attributes, of cultural separation between the two villages. Gray ware, the most common class of pottery, provides the best sample for intervillage comparison. In the total sample from Betatakin, representing the span from A.D. 1267 to 1286, Keet Seel Gray outnumbers corrugated sherds 5 to 1. In contemporary levels in Keet Seel midden deposits, this ratio is nearly reversed. In Stratum 14, the largest Tsegi Phase sample from the midden - post-dating A.D. 1275 - the proportion of plain gray to corrugated sherds is 1:4. Strata 13, 15, and 16 show the same relative frequency. That this is not due to "contamination" by Pueblo II corrugated pottery is shown in the uppermost level (Level 1) of the 1934 trench. This level lacks Pueblo II decorated sherds, and the ratio of plain gray to corrugated sherds is 1:3. Similar differences are shown in sandal samples from the two villages (Table 8). In the Betatakin sample, wicker sandals are slightly more numerous than twilled sandals. At Keet Seel there are few wicker sandals; these come from the village proper. In earlier strata of the mound (Strata 12, 11, 10, 8, and 7) a few twilled sandal fragments were found, but wicker sandals were lacking. Judging by these differences, it is expected that comparison of other stylistic attributes of pottery from the two villages would show significant differences. Cultural disparity would be expected solely on the basis of geographical distance (about 9 miles) between the sites, but it is likely that 22</page><page sequence="23">TABLE 8. Sandal Types from Betatakin and Keet Seel Wicker Twill Betatakin 11 9 Keet Seel 12 64 other variables - demographic, structural, and historical - were involved as well. A preliminary discussion of these variables follows, as a beginning toward a framework within which may be formulated continuing studies in the Tsegi. Tsegi Phase sites are considered in the perspective of 1) the Kayenta region and its relationships with other regions, 2) Tsegi Canyon, and 3) relationships of sites within the canyon. The ceramic assemblages of Betatakin and Keet Seel conform to the Kayenta ceramic "school", a term applied by Lindsay to the basic ceramic tradition of the region (Lindsay 1969:333). Lindsay and Smith contrast this school in particular to the Jeddito School of the Tusayan region to the southeast (Smith 1962). A few types at Betatakin and Keet Seel suggest communication with the Tusayan region; these include Jeddito Black-on- orange at Keet Seel and Betatakin, and Jeddito Polychrome at Keet Seel. However, the only specimens which can be confidently identified as coming from the southeast are a single sherd of Klagetoh Polychrome identified by the writer from Judd's Betatakin excavations, and a Forestdale Smudged bowl collected at the same site by Cummings. By contrast, there is more substantial evidence that Keet Seel had communication with the Mesa Verde region that Betatakin lacked. Seventy sherds of Mesa Verde White Ware come from the 1934 excavations of Keet Seel rooms, and from the 1964 excavations of the midden; these sherds come from Strata 7 through 16 of the midden (Table 4), and indicate some contact throughout the village occupation. These Mesa Verde sherds differ in minor elements of technique from pottery native to Colorado and New Mexico (Erik K. Reed, Arthur H. Rohn, and Stewart Peckham, personal communica- tion). Temper is the most clearly distinctive characteristic; sand temper is most frequent, setting these sherds apart from the igneous-rock or sherd- tempered specimens common in the eastern portion of the Mesa Verde province. There is additional evidence of Mesa Verde contact in twilled basketry. Out of 42 specimens at Keet Seel, five are of over 3 - under 3 construction, 34 are over 2 - under 2, and three are over 1 - under 1. Betatakin has one over 3 - under 3 basket and 11 that are over 2 - under 2. Comparison of Tsegi Phase baskets with those of Mesa Verde Pueblo III, reported by Morris and Burgh (1944), shows that the over 3 - under 3 weave is usually restricted to the Mesa Verde area, while over 2 - under 2 is characteristic of the Tsegi (Anderson 1969:140-1). These Mesa Verde connections are in accord with a widespread occurrence of Mesa Verde 23</page><page sequence="24">pottery in the Kayenta region, with these non-indigenous pieces more frequent in sites closer to the Mesa Verde region (Lindsay 1969:329). That these connections may be the result of movement of people rather than trade is indicated by the presence of Mesa Verde-like architecture at Keet Seel. This includes a granary, probably dating after 1275, with block masonry and other Mesa Verde-like features, a circular room - possibly the base of a tower, and a pilastered kiva in nearby Turkey Cave (Dean 1969:125-6, 138-9). FURTHER IMPLICATIONS FOR HISTORICAL AND STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS Further research in Tsegi Canyon and nearby areas may be able to test for additional evidences of differential contact with the Mesa Verde area, and for population movements suggested by the architecture and midden deposits at Keet Seel. Such movements may well have involved more than mere migration of families and transmission of cultural traits; previous studies of the Kayenta region and Tsegi Canyon suggest that social institutions such as religious sodalities may have been transmitted as well. In the nmid-1200's, population in the Kayenta region was in a state of flux, characterized by immigration, settlement shifts, remodelling of old settlements and formation of new communities. Lindsay has identified two basic community types at this time: 1) plaza-oriented villages which suggest tightly integrated communities and 2) courtyard-oriented villages which suggest an agglom- erated settlement of relatively autonomous social units. Lindsay infers that plaza-oriented villages represent localized lineages, while courtyard com- munities may have included several lineage segments (Lindsay 1969:367-73). This contrast in village layout is apparently associated to some degree with two kiva types; circular kivas are ubiquitious and are the indigenous traditional form, while the rectangular type, such as found at Betatakin, is apparently a 13th century introduction, associated only with courtyard- oriented sites. Dean suggests that lack of evidence of localized lineages in Tsegi Canyon, plus evidence of village-wide integration, indicates an integra- tive institution on the order of clans (Dean 1969:37-9). This is only one of several possible institutions possessing supra-lineage or supra-village integra- tive possibilities. Others are moieties, phratries, the Katchina cult, mens' associations and village associations (Dean 1969:38). The Katchina cult, as Dean has noted, can be ruled out; in none of the large collections from Tsegi Phase sites that have been studied by the author has there appeared paraphernalia indicative of Katchina costume or ritual (Anderson 1969:216). There is likewise no evidence in architecture of dual ceremonial or residence divisions as at Chaco or Mesa Verde (Dean 1970:166). One source of evidence of this type of integrative institution - pictographic art - has so far been overlooked.. Although interpretation of 24</page><page sequence="25">pictographic symbols as direct analogies of present-day clan symbols may involve unwarranted assumptions, we can legitimately consider rock art as symbols of socio-religious units; such symbols can be assumed to vary in number with the number and inclusiveness of such units. A recent study of Tsegi Canyon rock art (Schaafsma 1966) has produced data on a variety of Tsegi Phase petrographic motifs. One type of motif is distinctive in several Tsegi Phase villages - a large white circular painted figure at the right end of the village. This occurs in four sites in Tsegi Canyon - Betatakin, Batwoman House, Lolomaki and Twin Caves Pueblo. It does not occur in Keet Seel, which has a pictographic complex quite different from that of Betatakin (Table 9). Keet Seel panels also share a few elements which have been reported at Wetherill Mesa (Schaafsma 1966; Hayes 1964:120-1), which may be further evidence of cultural affiliations to the northeast. Differences in these pictographic elements parallel to some degree differences in village structure and location, and suggest a dichotomy in origin and structure of integrative institutions. This division consists of 1) two TABLE 9.

Keet Seel had a maximum population of 130-150, at approximately A.D. 1280-1286. It is much more heterogeneous in architecture than Betatakin, and a relative autonomy of households is indicated by the manner in which rooms were built, abandoned and re-occupied throughout the history of the village (Dean 1969:144-50). It contains six circular kivas, and possibly used two others in nearby Turkey Cave. Twin Caves Pueblo contains 12 room clusters, and had a maximum population of 60. Like Keet Seel cave, this location has a history of early use, with a Pueblo I occupation dating at 850-1000. Dates for the Tsegi Phase village indicate a single influx of most of its population about 1272 to 1273, with rather desultory building activity until A.D. 1280. The village has three kivas; two are similar to circular kivas at Keet Seel, while the third has pilasters and kivas similar to those at Mesa Verde and Kiva 2 at Turkey Cave (Dean 1969:162-6). Betatakin was a village of a maximum of 20 households, with a population of perhaps 125, and was apparently the result of planned movement into the site beginning in A.D. 1267. It contains more recognizable courtyard complexes than the other Tsegi villages. Two rectangular kivas are associated with the community, one of which is in an adjacent cave (Dean 1969:83, 149; Anderson 1966). Batwoman House contained a minimum of 13 households, with an estimated population of 65 people. A pure Tsegi Phase ceramic assemblage accords with tree-ring dates in the late 1270's. No kivas are present in the village (Dean 1969:162-6). Lolomaki is a small ruin of 11 rooms and courtyards representing a single or double household residence of no more than 10 persons. The ceramic assemblage is a typical Tsegi Phase profile and one tree-ring date of 1277 came from the site (Dean 1969:160-1). Obviously, connections with the Mesa Verde area would be less likely to occur in sites further south; hand-and-toe trails lead from both Keet Seel and Twin Caves Pueblo to the Canyon rim, which would allow communication over Skeleton Mesa. Equally important would be the location of sites in the Tsegi system; Twin Caves Pueblo, Batwoman House and Lolomaki all lie in Dogoszhibiko Canyon, which empties into the main Tsegi almost directly across from the mouth of Betatakin Canyon. These villages were probably in continuous contact, with communication between them channeled through the canyon, and with fields from all villages not far apart. The presence of the large circular pictographic motif at Twin Caves suggests that this village was involved in this network, although architecturally it also appears to have had affiliations with Keet Seel. 26</page><page sequence="27">ARIZONA SKELETON MESA TURKEY CAVE TWIN KEET SEEL CAVES BATWOMAN HOUSE BETATAKIN, -MILES f Figure 8. Tsegi Canyon Sites 27</page><page sequence="28">In view of these comparisons, certain expectations may be proposed, which can perhaps be tested in additional studies of cultural material from the sites. These studies could utilize close architectural analysis such as Dean has carried out at Betatakin and Keet Seel, and study of total artifact samples from each site; the fact that all sites have been previously excavated precludes the possibility of using material from specific locations within the village. Using these total samples it would be expected that Keet Seel would show closest affiliation with Twin Caves, and less affiliation with other villages. Twin Caves Pueblo in turn can be expected to show greater affiliation with the other villages than does Keet Seel. In addition, we would expect that the remaining Dogoszhibiko villages and Betatakin would show greater cultural homogeneity than the two northern villages. These comparisons would not only reflect the degree of cultural affiliations that would be expected from geographical distance, but might be expected in addition to give some insight into the nature of integrative institutions evident in pictographic art and village structure. Using these sites, and others in the Canyon system, it should be possible to compare the degree of similarity of ceramics, architecture and pictographic styles, to determine if these dimensions of cultural behavior are related variables. If this is the case, then population movement probably involved that of whole households or village segments rather than merely intermarriage, and movement of these segments would involve transmission of core personnel of a religious sodality. Such sodalities may have been village-wide institutions, and may be associated with the overall integration evident in the construction of Betatakin. However, it is likely that in some cases they represented less than the total village membership, judging from the fact that more than one of the large circular motifs exist at Batwoman House and Twin Caves Pueblo. In addition, at Twin Caves Pueblo there may be other motifs (Schaafsma 1966); this might be expected since there is the possibility that this village drew upon more than one region for its personnel. It is suggested that these and related questions concerning historical relationships and village structure may be profitably considered as a means of integrating historical and structural analysis of Tsegi Canyon populations.
