<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Theological Implications of the tawqif-istildh Antithesis and the majaz Controversy - Part I Mustafa Shah SOAS, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON A cursory examination of the grammatical, philological and exegetical treatises which span the formative years of the Arabic linguistic tradition reveals an abundance of loyal references to the established precedents of Qur'anic readings and the hegemony of the cUthmanic codices. Such citations are adduced in the wake of the linguists' speculative configurations of the diction of scripture: variations on the qircCat inspired by their sophisticated models of grammar. Given the incontrovertibly sacrosanct nature of the Qur'an, linguistic speculation of this kind had to be moderated and placed into perspective, hence the prominence of such references. There is certainly little evidence of an ulterior motive spurring on these linguists, but rather an avid interest in the phenomenon of language. Linguists of Kufan and Basran persuasions engaged in this seemingly radical linguistic erudition, despite the fact that it encroached upon the strictures of a religious orthodoxy. Indeed, a similar intrepidity, however disparaged, marked the linguists' contributions within the field of philology: the propensity to disregard the doctrinal implications of their approach to the linguistic idiosyncrasies of scripture was likewise an uncompromising feature of their philological endeavours. Doctrinal circumspection and religious influences had previously governed the linguistic activities of the earliest reader-grammarians who subordinated the study of the phenomenon of language to the service of the Qur'an. A more unrestrained approach was adopted by the ensuing generations of Kufan and Basran linguists. Before examining whether such observations concerning the extent of religious influ ence can be definitively substantiated, it is worth considering an opposing thesis outlined by Kopf, stressing the belief that religious considerations seriously hindered the linguists from developing creative theories in both grammar and philology.1 Kopf suggested that linguistic ingenuity was compromised and philological theories mind fully adjusted to ensure that any abstract application of linguistic premises could be reconciled with an accepted religious orthodoxy.2 Kopf argued that lexicographical compilations were invariably embedded with lexical paraphrase insidiously introduced to buttress theological orthodoxy; or, indeed, to circumvent the anthropomorphic imagery of scripture.3 He added that an air of reticence affected the philologists'</page><page sequence="2">28 Journal of Qur'anic Studies attempts to tackle resourcefully the question of foreign vocabulary in the language of the Qur'an; the issue of the perceived primacy of the dialect of Quraysh in the Qur'an and its unrivalled eloquence; and the intricate debate regarding the origin of language, a subject grappled with by the Greek philosophers. Furthermore, Kopf noted that even the personal conduct of several leading philologists was reverently scrutinized for indiscretions, adversely reducing the linguistic contributions such figures might have made to philology as their endeavours were ignominiously censured or ignored in the light of certain misdemeanours.4 However, Kopf was confronted by an anomaly in his hypothesis: he reported that some philologists dared to suggest emendations of peculiar Qur'anic readings, although they surrendered to the protestations of the theologians, apparently refraining from an indulgence in linguistic pedantry. The primary source material confirms that religious influences did not prevent the linguists from criticizing both readers and readings which had contravened their Procrustean models of grammar; this apparent inconsistency was consciously acknowledged by Kopf as he recalled that a number of readings were 'rejected on philological grounds by early scholars'.5 However, the scholars to whom Kopf was referring were principally linguists; the use of the term 'scholars' hinted that such criticisms were widely voiced among the learned; however, it was not the 'schol ars' of Islam who had pronounced these linguistic criticisms of scripture, nor had they initiated such processes, rather they were given currency by grammarians and philolo gists, particularly in the readings to which Kopf referred. This very fact undermines the thesis that religious considerations arrested the linguists' attempts to forge overtly controversial linguistic theories. While it is undoubtedly true that the diction of scripture, along with the general tenor of its religious impetus, fur nished a developing linguistic tradition with an elaborate framework for the analysis of language, the linguists operated oblivious to the profound theological implications that their linguistic theories had for the immutable status of scripture and its linguistic integrity; moreover, in their quest to deliver a robust theory of language, the wider religious ramifications were considerably attenuated both in grammar and philology, although for Kopf all linguistic activity was subject to the strictures holding sway within the sphere of the classical Islamic sciences. The issue of tawqif al-lugha, the revelationist nature of the origin of language, has been carefully explored in several authoritative studies.6 However, the wider implica tions of such a theory within the field of philology and, in particular, its theological dimensions in this respect appear to have been principally glossed over. Tawqif al lugha had matured into the belief that language was divinely inspired and revealed by the Almighty to Adam. The antithesis of this doctrine predicated that the development of language was contingent upon human convention, istilah; moreover, a natural opposition was gradually set up between the two positions, mirroring a similar</page><page sequence="3">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 29 consequential development in the division of speech into haqiqa (veridical) contra majaz (tropical).7 Nevertheless, as we shall see, the four terms were inextricably linked to issues of a distinctly theological nature. A definition of tawqif and istilah was a standard feature in the epistemological preliminaries of the treatises on usul al-fiqh, along with several language-based postulates which provided the linguistic instruments for a rational approach to the textual exposition of scripture. The issue had been expounded upon in treatises on the preambles of faith (usul al-dln) and mindfully probed in the philological compilations of the linguists.8 A work which meticulously brought together a synopsis of the origin of language from the juridical, theological and linguistic perspectives was al-Suyutf s al-Muzhir fi Qulum al-lugha wa-anwcfiha. This work was a reference point for many of the contemporary studies on this subject. Among the linguists who expressed a view on this topic, the doctrine of tawqif'was instinctively endorsed; yet within the field of law and theology, a non-committal view came to be prevalent, although among the exponents of orthodoxy the position was decidedly more circumspect.9 In a work which examined the influence of Greek abstraction in Arabic linguistic think ing, Versteegh had maintained that aspects of the debate on the tawqif-istilah issue reflected similar linguistic discussions initiated in Greek linguistic thinking, betraying an external connection.10 The terms cpwi? and fteo-i? were respectively identified with tawqif Mid istilah. Versteegh had also suggested that Arabic grammatical termi nology was based on a putative Greek model, but his recent examination of several early Qur'an commentaries has led him to discard this earlier hypothesis regarding external influences within the discipline of grammar.11 According to Weiss' accom plished assessment of Muslim discussions of the origin of language, the debate on this topic was stimulated by developments within the Islamic milieu.12 Indeed, it was evident that orthodoxy's position was prefigured by an interpretation of Q.2:31, a verse which speaks of language in the form of asma' being revealed by God to Adam: 4 And He taught Adam all the names (asma'), then showed them to the angels, saying: inform me of the names of these, if ye are truthful.'13 Besides, several prophetic tradi tions also pre-eminently buttressed the tawqif perspective, although there was seldom any consensus as to the precise nature of the origin of language.14 Weiss summarizes the various stages through which the debate on the origin of language evolved, refer ring to the perceptive examination of the issue by Ibn Taymiyya (661 -728/1263-1328), who reported that the first figure to promulgate innovatively the conventionalist (istilah) perspective was the Muctazilite Abu Hashim (d.321/933), the son of the eminent al Jubba'T (d.303/915).15 Ibn Taymiyya also reports that the thesis of tawqif al-lugha was trenchantly defended by Abu '1-Hasan al-Ashcari (260-324/813-935).16 Weiss presents the view, based on Ibn Taymiyya's survey, that Abu Hashim's concept of istilah was preceded by a naturalist hypothesis, an ephemeral theory initiated by the onomato poeic speculation of the earliest linguists.17 Weiss believes that this particular theory,</page><page sequence="4">30 Journal of Qur'anic Studies described as 'naturalist', was eventually discarded as the dialectic dimensions of the arguments become pronounced, leaving a tawqlf-istilah opposition. He also noted that a number of prominent Muctazilites such as al-Jubba'I conspicuously propounded the revelationist (tawqif) interpretation of the original language. According to Weiss, this was because this doctrine was deeply rooted in early orthodoxy and keenly embraced by the earliest theologians and exegetes.18 Subsequent positions apropos the tawqlf-istilah dichotomy attempted to strike a balance in the arguments, incorporating various features of both of these theories. The conventionalist view reigned predominantly amongst the later Muctazilites. Weiss focuses on the fact that the debate on this topic had gradually dissipated and the issue seemingly neutralized. He suggests that tawqif'was sanctioned as an inevitable coroll ary of orthodoxy's stance on the issue of the non-created nature of the Qur'an: istilah helped undermine this doctrine. Furthermore, that the new orthodoxy of the Ashcarites reviewed the position regarding the finer points of the nature of 'Divine Speech', which was placed on an altogether separate plane from ordinary human speech, resulting in the revelationist theory losing its raison d'etre. The concluding remarks of Weiss re count that the old orthodox view continued to be espoused by figures such as Ibn Hazm (384-456/994-1064) and Ibn Taymiyya. We shall witness, however, that in the case of the latter figure the approach to the issue was developed from a purely theological perspective, aimed at countering the resolution of scripture through the application of metaphor, yet paradoxically Ibn Taymiyya does not endorse a doctrine of tawqif al-lug ha in the emphatic way it was espoused by the linguists. Nevertheless, despite such an assertive endorsement of tawqif al-lugha amongst linguists of both the Kufan and Basran traditions, the spirit of the doctrine was regularly contravened; again, this seemingly confirms that linguists were not necessarily restricted by religious influences. To gauge an idea of the linguists' interpretation of the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha we can consider some aspects of its outline in the work of the Kufan scholar Ibn Faris (d.395/1004-5). Quoting Q. 2:31, he rules that although the verse in question speaks in terms of asmd', it encompasses all aspects of language: the names of all things animate and abstract were imparted to Adam.19 He adds: 'If someone were to ask, "Are you saying that our articulation of words such as husdm, sayf cadb and other similar ex pressions are established via tawqif and that no such words are conventionally de rived?" We would say to him "Indeed, that is what we are saying.'"20 To demonstrate the validity of this statement, Ibn Faris refers to the consensus of scholars regarding the processes of ihtijaj (citation) and the use of the diction of a specific tribe in agree ments and disagreements on language: this citation extended to the use of its poetry; moreover, he deduces that if language were based upon muwddaca (a positing of meaning agreed conventionally) and istilah, then one specific diction would be no more</page><page sequence="5">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 31 pertinent for citation than a dialect arbitrarily set up in contemporary circumstances, nor could one distinguish between the two.21 Ibn Faris is keen to point out that this divinely inspired language was not introduced at a single stage but rather in an episodic fashion to a succession of prophets with each stage of positing governed by the needs and circumstances of the time. It had begun with the prophet Adam and culminated with the prophet Muhammad, who had been bestowed with an incompara bly consummate diction. Ibn Faris then turns his attention to the empirical evidence, stating that it had not come to the notice of anyone amongst his contemporaries that a given tribe from among the Arabs had agreed upon a process of denomination in a conventionalist manner; if this were the case, one might be able to ascertain that previ ous processes of this kind had been in existence corroborating the validity of istilah. Indeed, nor is it known that the prophet's companions, who were paragons of excel lence in relation to the Islamic sciences, had contrived a dialect or a single word not previously known. The involved nature of Ibn Faris's interpretation of tawqif is rendered more intricate by his assertion that the sciences of grammar, orthography and prosody were also primordial: they had gradually disappeared in time before they were rediscovered and reinvigorated by the likes of Abu '1-As wad al-Du'all (d .69/723) and al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahldl (d. 175/822). Ibn Faris was a figure to whom several Qur'anic commen taries were attributed. He was also the author of a work on the principles of jurispru dence and a further work on substantive law; a biography of the Prophet and a number of authoritative philological and lexicographical compilations, including defences of Kufan grammar.22 He is clearly linked with the orthodoxy of the Kufan tradition of linguistics, emulating the pious religiosity of his predecessors such as Thaclab (d.291/ 904), Ibrahim al-Harbi (198-285/813-99) and Niftawayhi (d.323/935). The views outlined by Ibn Faris formed part of his detailed prelude to grammatical and philologi cal definitions in the same way that language-based preliminaries featured prominently in the treatises on the principles of law; however, in the case of Ibn Faris a number of these definitions clearly contradicted the essence of the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha, a belief to which he had subscribed. Ibn Jinni was a student of the celebrated Abu cAlI al-Farisi (d. 377/987) and together they were recognized as eminent scholars within the Basran school of linguistics in the fourth/tenth centuries. Both figures were known for their Muctazilite inclinations, par ticularly Abu cAli al-Farisi who was patronized by the Buwayhids and cAdud al-Dawla (ruled 338-72/949-83). Weiss, Loucel and Kopf were all astounded that these ardent Mu'tazilites should choose to espouse wholeheartedly the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha.23 However, the ingenuous acceptance of a given doctrine, while also ensuring that such a doctrine was applied uniformly to a theory of language, proved to be an exacting burden. In his work Ibn Jinni announces that the majority of dialecticians believed</page><page sequence="6">32 Journal of Qur'anic Studies language was established via tawaduc (conventional agreement) and istildh, as opposed to wahy (Divine inspiration) and tawqif; however, he significantly reports that his mentor Abu cAli al-Farisi had endorsed the tawqlf perspective, citing the 'indisputable' Qur'anic passage Q. 2:31, which implied tawqif al-lugha. Ibn Jinni then records that it was possible that Adam had been empowered by the Almighty to estab lish a series of sound-meaning conventions and, furthermore, that such a spin on the verse was plausible and implicit within a less rigid doctrine of tawqif al-lugha.24 Ibn Jinni observes that this latter view was held briefly by Abu cAli and it was also the opinion of Abu T-Hasan, a figure who is reported as having entertained the notion that the prerogative in this respect was with Adam.25 Ibn Jinni returns to a further explanation of tawqif expounding the fact that the Al mighty had taught Adam the names of created things in all forms of speech: Arabic, Persian, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and other languages; ex hypothesis these were trans mitted by the offspring of Adam to all corners of the inhabited world. At this juncture Ibn Jinni states that if authenticated reports have come affirming this, then one has to accept and accede to such beliefs. It is evident from the selection of quotations found in the Muzhir that the exponents of istildh sought to regain the initiative by suggesting that asma', as mentioned in Q. 2:31, did not comprise all the relevant parts of language such as verbs and particles.26 The riposte to this accusation centred on the reasoning that the term asma' incorporated all the elements of language in the same way that the notion of taghlib was used to explain the comprehensive nature of the phrase Qaradahum, ('showed them') which also features in the same Qur'anic verse: the attached plural pronoun comprised all things created, including inanimate objects.27 It was also possi ble to argue that one had to differentiate between asma" as mentioned in the Qur'an and the term innovatively introduced at a decidedly posterior juncture by grammarians to designate a class of words. While exploring thoughtfully the reasoning of those who rejected the role of wahy in language, Ibn Jinni reports that they maintained that the phenomenon of language depended upon a preceding phase of muwddofa in which characteristics and outward features would be assigned words in a gesticulative fashion by two or more arbitrators: these established terms would then be progressively assigned names in other languages.28 The advocates of this view were able to place distance between God and muwadaca by claiming that gesticulation was an intrinsic part of establishing words and it required a jdriha (organ), something which the Almighty does not have. It is not clear whether the anthropomorphic connotation governed the rejection of muwddaca being attributed to the Almighty or whether it served as a beneficial pretext for this particular interpretation. Ibn Jinni even recalls that he took up this issue with the expo nents of this view, proposing that muwadaca initiated by the Almighty does not necess arily require the presence of an organ: if He were to create sounds in objects, these</page><page sequence="7">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 33 would be instantaneously recognized by a hearer who would emulate these, establish ing a semiotic correlation between sounds and objects.29 Ibn Jinni reports that it was tentatively conceded that his thesis was feasible, although it was not conclusively endorsed. Having recorded a further perspective which accentuates the onomatopoeic factor in the origin of language, Ibn Jinni intimates that after much profound delibera tion and sedate reflection the belief that language is tawqif and wahy was an incontro vertible truth and, moreover, a profusion of authenticated akhbdr clearly underlines its revelationist origin and nature.30 This natural affinity between meanings and sounds was a view commonly associated with the grammarian al-Khalil ibn Ahmad and the Muctazilite SAbbad ibn Sulayman. It would not be too presumptuous to assert that, in principle, the revelationist explana tion of language's origin held sway among linguists of both Kufan and Basran persua sions, although one cannot dismiss the likelihood that a theory of istilah may have been nurtured by a number of linguists.31 There is also the onomatopoeic supposition which may have reigned briefly before it was discarded. However, even amongst figures notable for their rationalistic penchant, tawqif al-lugha was upheld in consist ency with the orthodoxy of the earliest theologians who championed this doctrine; istilah was a theory which crystallized at a much later date and it appears to have been engendered by arguments of a theological hue. The entrenched nature of tawqif al lugha did not diminish the enthusiasm with which the linguists developed philological theories which paradoxically impinged upon the very doctrine which was accepted as a distinction of religious orthodoxy. Furthermore, their philological endeavour gradu ally paved the way for a less stringent interpretation of tawqif's significance. Thus Weiss refers to the fact that scholars such as the Shaficite jurist Abu Ishaq al-Isfara'Inl (d.414/1087) argued that while tawqif formed the bedrock of language it was signifi cantly enhanced by dynamic phases of istilah. Indeed, Weiss also noted that a non committal view was professed by Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (d.404/1003).32 The philo logical creativity of the linguists was not pursued with theological considerations in mind. It was the inevitable consequence of a thoroughly abstract approach to the analysis of language. Contraventions of tawqif al-lugha were particularly manifest in the areas of ishtiqdq, ishtirdk, tardduf and adddd (etymology, homonymity, synonymity and antonyms). The topic of ishtiqdq, recognized by linguists as an instrument of language develop ment, was ruminated over by Kufan and Basran luminaries. It was traditionally divided into three categories.33 The first of these was al-ishtiqdq al-saghir and centred on the morpho-syntactic variation of radicals within a fixed root, the derivatives of which indicated aspects of the same meaning and were often complementary. It was deemed the most common form of derivation and featured prominently in grammati cal treatises. Ibn Faris acknowledges that the language of the Arabs was subject to</page><page sequence="8">34 Journal of Qur'anic Studies qiyds (patterns) and that the Arabs derived parts of their speech from other related parts.34 He reports that although ishtiqaq was a valid instrument for gauging the language of the Arabs, it was imperative to note that forays into this area had to be tempered with the realization that language was revelationist in nature (tawqif): it was not possible to contrive language or speak that which the Arabs had refrained from uttering, nor should one introduce a qiyds not used in the language, for that would be fallacious and inimical to the attributes of language. A linguist's function was to trace these primordial patterns of language from a predetermined corpus of words. Al-Suyuti reports that there were differences concerning al-ishtiqaq al-saghir (which he refers to as al-asghar). Some linguists argued that certain parts of speech were derived through etymology and others were not.35 Al-Suyuti also speaks of a second view which suggests that speech consisted of derivatives only, a view which is linked with Sibawayhi (d. 183/799) and al-Zajjaj (241-311/854-923); a final view held by a number of dialec ticians claims that all speech is asl. It appears that al-Suyuti described the second view as disordered for it fails to explain how these derivatives came into being; nor does it differentiate between the root and branch of words. The convoluted nature of the discussions would appear to imply that the predetermined qiyds of the Arabs was being contravened. There were also implications for the issue of foreign words in the diction of carabiyya. The second form of derivation, al-ishtiqaq al-kabir (metathesis), also termed qalb, is defined as the uniform transposition of the radicals within a given verb such that what ever the permutation, the cognates were univocal. The typical examples of this are the verbs ja/dha/ba and ba/ka/la and their derivatives.36 The obvious question which requires some explanation stems from the enigmatic nature of the origin of the term: how does one determine the root from the branch in relation to the cognates ja/dha/ba and ja/ba/dhal The solution was to seek the form which was more prolific in usage: this must be the root. Ibn Jinni labelled this type of derivation al-ishtiqaq al-akbar; indeed, he seems to have been fascinated by its effect, forwarding a selection of exam ples which indicate its merit.37 Amongst these examples is the root ja/ba/ra, whose derived terms denoted the quality of potency and strength in all contexts. Al-Suyutl's Muzhir stresses that the form of ishtiqaq as expounded upon by Ibn Jinni should not lead to istinbdt (invention) in the language of the Arabs: this was not permissible; furthermore, it mentions that Ibn Jinni recognized and understood that he was not the contriver of such forms. It is also suggested that despite the common unity of meaning, each of the derivatives was semantically unique; however, the nuances in meaning were neglected by the ancient Arabs and others as a result of the finite number of words and the seemingly infinite number of possible meanings. As we shall see with the concept of homonyms and synonyms, the univocal nature of this form of ishtiqaq suggested a linguistic redundancy and superfluity which could not be reconciled with the Divine wisdom inherent in the inception of language. The Muzhir does extol the</page><page sequence="9">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 35 practical value of this form of derivation, but it also states unequivocally that this in no way predicates that language is conventionally derived.38 The third form of derivation was classified as al-ishtiqaq al-akbar; it was also referred to as ibddl. It entailed the substitution of a radical in a given root with a consonant which was phonetically similar, although some philologists did not stipulate a proxim ity in the origins of exchanged consonants. The unity of meaning was maintained, if not slightly diluted in the derived term. Abu Tayyib al-Lughawi (d.350/961), a Basran who was the author of several philological treatises, devoted a work to this subject. He reports that ibddl was not an arbitrary exchange of consonants exclusively sanctioned by the Arabs, rather it emanated from dialectal variants which had the same mean ings.39 Thus terms such as hdlik and hdnik were epithets indicating something black or dark in colour. Ibn Faris reports that al-Khalll ibn Ahmad supposedly claimed that a verse of the Qur'an (Q.17:5) exhibited ibddl: the ha' had been replaced with the letter jim: the verse was recited as jdsu in place of hdsu\ Ibn Faris retorts that he does not believe that al-Khalil would have said this and therefore he could not authenticate such a report.40 While ishtiqdq covered a broad spectrum of related theories, and some of these theo ries evidently infringed upon the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha as outlined in the works of Ibn Jinni and Ibn Faris, the opposition to such theories was articulated by a minority of linguists and theologians. As noted by Loucel, Niftawayhi, the Zahirite reader and grammarian renowned for his defence of orthodoxy, compiled a work entitled Kitdb al-radd cald man yatam anna al-carab yushtaqqu kaldmuhu bacduhu min bazd.4] A selection of linguistically-inspired refutations was composed by the Basran gram marian Ibn Darastawayhi (258-346/871-958). This included a refutation of qalb and a further treatise repudiating the concept of antonyms in language. Renowned for his austere religiosity, his approach to the phenomenon of language was strictly governed by a theological orthodoxy. Among the other works he composed were a refutation of Ibn Miqsam's grammatically inspired approach to readings of the Qur'an; a diatribe against the approach to grammar of the Muctazilite Abu Zayd al-Balkhi; a denuncia tion of the notion of superfluity in language; a refutation of al-Farra"s Macdni al Qur'dn; a history of the linguistic sciences and a defence of the grammarians against the criticisms made by the heretic Ibn al-Rawandi.42 Ibn Hazm also denounced a form of ishtiqdq which presupposes istilah and was practised by some Basran grammarians; indeed, the example that he cited can be traced through the biographical literature to the Basran philologist and reader Abu cAmr ibn al-cAla' (d.154/771). Moreover, in the same work on the principles of jurisprudence, Ibn Hazm had robustly defended the concept of tawqif al-lugha The linguists continued ingenuously to pursue theories on ishtiqdq without regard to the consequences for the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. A Basran who adhered to the</page><page sequence="10">36 Journal of Qur'anic Studies orthodoxy of the Hanbalites, al-Zajjaj, elaborated a theory of ishtiqaq which empha sized a semantic affinity in words sharing phonological properties. His thesis of ishtiqaq featured throughout his own work on the subject of Macarii al-Qur'an and it was often the subject of derision on the part of his Basran peers; the theory was seemingly devel oped by his mentor Abu Bakr ibn al-Sarraj (d. 316/928), although this latter figure appears to countenance a more reserved approach.44 Ibn Faris appears shrewdly aware of the pitfalls of ishtiqaq for the accepted doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. While discuss ing the provenance of several analogically derived neologisms, he declares all such examples are based on tawqif'as defined in the prelude to his work; furthermore, he adds that the notion that frequency of the use of certain terms engenders a host of secondary terms must also be governed by the parameters of tawqif. the branch is determined by tawqif'as is the root45 A minority amongst the grammarians subordi nated their linguistic thinking to the doctrine of tawqif while amongst the majority, compliance was controversially restricted to mere lip service. The disagreements regarding homonyms were also pronounced. The lafz al-mushtarak is introduced as two words similar in form (physically identical) but different in mean ing.46 The philologists had observed that there was a vast stock of single terms within the idiom of the Arabs that could have two or more dissimilar meanings. Kufan and Basran linguists compiled several works exploring this phenomenon under the rubric ma ittafaqa lafiuhu wa-ikhtalafa macndhu.41 Al-Suyutl's review of this phenomenon shows that one way of accounting for such a feature was to claim that the dissimilar meanings emanated from distinct phases in the arbitrary positing of meanings; this clearly implied a conventionalist approach to the development of language 48 An alternative approach was to suggest that although the occurrence of ishtirak might imply that language comprised that which was ambiguous, it had a purpose in the Divine scheme of things. Moreover, that the apparatus of language was finite and meanings were infinite, necessitated that words be applied to more than one mean ing 49 Besides, the empirical evidence overwhelmingly corroborated the incidence of homonyms in the language of the Arabs, as the material adduced by lexicographers confirmed. Al-Suyuti also speaks of such a feature being part of a single phase of wadc, providing a usefully subtle retreat in precarious circumstances through the vehi cle of ambiguous language.50 Ibn Slda's voluminous lexicon, al-Mukhassas fi 'l-lugha, alludes to ishtirak while discussing the incidence of antonyms in Arabic. He quotes a lengthy statement by Abu cAli al-Farisi in which the latter explains that homonyms were not a deliberately origi nal feature of wadc, rather they were spawned by the entwining of dialects; or that each word was used for a specific meaning before being borrowed for a secondary meaning which, following prolific usage, predominates over primary usage of the word and becomes like the asl.51 This process furnishes the word with two semantic dimensions: such an explanation has obvious overtones of the haqiqa-majdz dichotomy; however,</page><page sequence="11">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 37 although the lafi al-mushtarak may have ultimately resulted from a majaz odyssey, each expression was haqiqa (veridical) in its own right. Ibn Darastawayhi anchors a refutation of ishtirak to the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha, arguing that the introduction of ambiguities into speech was neither prudent nor sound: The conceiver of language, Mighty and Revered be He, is both Wise and Knowledge able; for language is conceived for the elucidation of meaning. If it were possible to use a single word to denote two separate meanings, or indeed, that these two meanings should each denote opposite qualities, that would not constitute elucidation but rather obfuscation and disguise.'52 Ibn Darastawayhi moves on to explore the reasons why this was not possible, suggesting that such occurrences were rare but subject to a rationale. Moreover, although much of this data was recorded of the Arabic language, it was erroneously rationalized. He highlights a similar misunderstanding concerning the physical resemblance in the conjugated paradigms of the first and fourth forms of verbs: these were construed as outwardly having the same physical appearance although they had different meanings; moreover, such idiosyncrasies were unques tionably discerned in the vernacular of the Arabs but incorrectly interpreted. This ma terial emanated from separate dialectal sources, or was the result of elision or abbre viation which created a physical resemblance, concealing the genuine distinctions.53 Ibn Darastawayhi had begun his analysis of ishtirak by referring specifically to exam ples outlined in the Kitdb of Sibawayhi, who had used the root wa/ja/da to illustrate ishtirak. Ibn Darastawayhi argued that these were in fact nuances of the same meaning placed in different contexts. The cognates of this particular root were adduced to underline the incidence of homonyms in Arabic. Furthermore, the ontological signifi cance of the term wujud was invariably used as a tour de force to justify the resort to metaphor in scripture. Thus one finds Ibn Taymiyya criticizing Sayf al-Din al-Amidl, who refers to this term in his work on the principles of jurisprudence, al-lhkdmfi usul al-ahkdm, as axiomatic of the phenomenon of majaz in the Arabic language.54 Ibn Taymiyya's interest in this and other linguistic topics stems from the fact that such theories were used to support preconceived theological agendas which in his view undermined religious orthodoxy, as we shall see. Weiss' summary of these issues in the light of al-Amidl's Ihkam argues that the agent responsible for the positing of language remained anonymous as scholars hesitated in identifying the wddiQ. Weiss argues that although scholars believed that they were engaged in the search for primordial language, they failed to recognize that language was in a continual state of flux: hence the reference to an inventor or inventors. Yet for Ibn Darastawayhi it is clearly the Almighty who is the wddic. Weiss also mentions that scholars hypothesized that nouns, synonyms and homonyms developed in different ways at the moment of the invention of lugha; but contrary to this view, one finds that the theories advanced to support or to reject these philological phenomena did not</page><page sequence="12">38 Journal of Qur'anic Studies entirely accept such a premise.55 The linguists were not so naive in their understanding of language development and, furthermore, dialectal forces were identified by lin guists as playing an important role in the evolution of lugha, as their attempts to ration alize etymology and derivation show. Weiss adds that in al-Amidl's analysis, the ishtirak vocable was believed to have had a double meaning from the primordial point of the inception of language; it had not followed the trajectory of a metaphor, acquiring a secondary meaning. The two or more literal meanings comprised within the lafi al mushtarak spring to mind whenever that lafi is articulated.56However, we can contrast these views with the aforementioned view of Abu cAlI al-Farisi who forwarded the supposition that homonyms had their origin in dialectal fusion. The topic of ishtirak was to play an important role within the field of jurisprudence, exegesis, theology and indeed logic.57 However, the nexus with the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha was becoming increasingly tenuous. Extending the thesis of ishtirak, one finds two further philological categories which were the subject of controversy: the first of these was the occurrence of tardduf (synonymity) in Arabic. The Risdla of al-Shafici (d. 204/820) describes it along with the occurrence of homonyms as an intrinsic feature of the speech of the Arabs.58 The linguists compiled a selection of treatises on this subject entitled ma ikhtalafat alfazuhu wa-ittafaqat macaniyahu. Ibn Darastawayhi describes this category as an oversight on the part of the linguists.59 The excerpts included by al-Suyuti of Ibn Darastawayhi's previous statement reveal that his rejection of homonyms also comprised a dismissal of the idea that different words could have the same meaning. Addressing the issue of whether the first and fourth forms of verbs could have the same meaning, he states that such a belief was fallacious in relation to analogy and reason and it was contrary to perceived wisdom: it was not possible for two separate words to have the same mean ing. Kopf noted that al-AsmacI (d. 213/828) denied the 'co-existence of synonymous verb forms of the 1st and 4th conjugation', a thesis which al-AsmacI extended into his own analysis of profane literature.60 Ibn Darastawayhi suggests that synonymity was only possible if each of the words was traceable to different dialects, in the same way that different languages have different words to denote the same meaning.61 He was joined by a number of Kufans who also denied that such a phenomenon might exist in Arabic, although it would be difficult to prove that their rejection was formulated on the basis that tardduf impinged upon the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. The eminent philologist Ibn al-A'rabl (ca.l 50-231/761-846) summarized that when two words are employed by the Arabs for a single meaning, each of these words fur nishes a unique aspect of meaning which is not inherent in the other word. He reports that 'it is possible for us to appreciate this [nuance of meaning] and relate it; similarly, it is possible that such [nuances] might remain obscure; however, one cannot insinuate that the Arabs were unaware of these.'62 The main point here was that the Arabs appre</page><page sequence="13">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 39 ciated the seemingly imperceptible distinctions between these so-called synonyms. Ibn Faris presented an opinion on this subject which was associated with the promi nent Kufan Thaclab, concluding that synonyms were in fact sifat (attributes) of a single noun: the term sav/has a number of attributes such as muhannad, sarim and husam, each of these words furnishes a decidedly different shade of the same meaning. This was also the case for verbs.63 Those who argued that synonyms were a feature of the idiom of Arabic cited substitution in expressions as proof of their occurrence: la rayba fihi can be used to function as la shakkafihv. if the notion of synonymity were disput able in this phrase, such usage would be inaccurate and that one of these terms is aptly used in place of the other term suggests the meaning is one. It was also the case that poets stylistically used different words for the same meaning. Such reasoning is rejected by Ibn Faris.64 Among the various views on the origin of synonyms recounted by al-Suyuti, one of these introduces the concept of istilah into the debate: synonyms were the result of the arbitrary allocation of discrete words to the same meaning by different tribes, each undiscerning of the other's denomination: the vocabulary was circulated and subse quently recognized as synonyms within the all-encompassing diction of Arabic. Al Suyuti informs his readers that this view was outlined in one of two accounts sug gested by ahl al-usul and it is predisposed to the thesis that language was 'convention ally derived' ,65 In the second view it was claimed that synonyms could be reconciled with a single stage of wadc: to rationalize this view it was granted that synonyms incisively enhanced and facilitated the medium of communication, providing language with a surfeit of stylistic features.66 Al-Raghib al-Isfahanl mentions that 'the state ments of those who rejected its occurrence speak of a single dialect; as to its occur rence in two dialects, no sensible person would deny this.'67 Further religious opposi tion to the concept of taraduf surfaces in the work of Abu Hilal al-cAskari (d. 398/ 1007) entitled al-Furuq al-lughawiyya. The work offers a selection of acute distinc tions between words classified as synonyms. He stresses that the semantic distinction inherent in these terms was a deliberate characteristic established by wadf al-lugha (the Almighty): there was Divine wisdom in this act.68 It is evident that a rejection of taraduf was formulated on the basis that it flagrantly defied a single stage of wacf as predicated by an interpretation of tawqif' al-lugha.m Although a number of linguists had rejected taraduf m principle, this did not arrest the enthusiastic manner in which material on synonyms was meticulously collected. Moreo ver, a summary examination of al-Suyutl's Muzhir shows that figures like Thaclab and Ibn al-A^abi, who had questioned the occurrence of such a phenomenon, did para doxically contribute to citing material which affirmed its incidence in Arabic. The profusion of treatises on this topic, whether in the form of topical monographs or lexi cographical texts, betrays the fact that in practical terms linguistic ingenuity was not</page><page sequence="14">40 Journal of Qur'anic Studies impeded by the perceived strictures of religious orthodoxy. The theory of tardduf and the corpus of philological material amassed by the linguists were judiciously employed in several of the classical disciplines. Similar arguments concerning its existence per vaded the field of exegesis and the Qur'anic sciences.70 We should note that Weiss observed that synonyms were not an important feature in the theorizing presented by al-Amidi in his Ihkdm, although homonyms were a requisite methodological tool in textual interpretation. He relates that al-Amidi cited the existence of a plurality of lexical codes, which mirrored synonymity, as proof of the presence of synonyms in the language of the Arabs, as well as the fact that they were not detrimental to communi cation.71 However, the fact that a non-committal view on tawqif al-lugha was also in vogue amongst the later jurists meant that istilah was no longer a contentious issue. Hence one finds the prominent jurist al-Shawkani (d.1255/1838) expressing his sur prise that paragons of language such as Thaclab and Ibn Faris had rejected this particu lar phenomenon. Al-Shawkani held that the arguments of the opponents of tardduf were 'outwardly pretentious and purely erratic', although he admits that advocates of tarddufhad shown similar extravagances.72 However, the acceptance or rejection of this phenomenon was no longer clearly linked with the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. The second extension of ishtirak which also attracted controversy was the thesis of adddd (antonyms): the concept that words could have two distinctly opposite mean ings. It is the redoubtable Ibn Darastawayhi who again voices his disdain for such a theory. In a critical commentary composed by Ibn Darastawayhi on Thaclab's Kitdb al-faslh he alludes to a work he composed with the specific aim of refuting this phenomenon, his Ibtal al-adddd.13 He also provides an example, citing the term naw' whose meaning centres on a burdensome ascent and was used to describe the rising or inclining of a celestial body such as a star; he reports that some philologists claim the term also denoted a descent and that it was an antonym.74 Ibn Faris mentions that some philologists had rejected adddd; however, he points to the body of empirical evidence which corroborates its incidence in Arabic. He also confirms that he compiled a trea tise which thoroughly repudiates such a rejection.75 Ibn Faris had placed concepts of etymology and synonyms firmly within the confines of a revelationist theory and yet here he resolutely endorses the incidence of adddd in Arabic. The Basran philologist Abu Hatim al-Sijistani (d.255/869), who was the author of a work on this subject of adddd, recognized that in some cases the inverse quality seem ingly inherent in such terms, designated as antonyms, was induced by way of a sub junctive agent: thus the term masjur can denote both fdrigh (empty) and mamW (replete); the latter quality represents a wish for such a state to transpire.76 The Kufan philologist Ibn al-Anbari (260-328/874-939) summarily impugned the opponents of this thesis, arguing that those who rejected it were predominantly heretics and enemies of the Arabs, motivated by the limits of their own wisdom and rhetoric.77 It is quite obvious that this was not a reference to those who expressed their opposition on</page><page sequence="15">The Philological Endeavours of the Early Arabic Linguists: Part 1 41 religious grounds such as Ibn Darastawayhi, but an indictment of the Shucubiyya move ment. Ibn al-Anbari highlights one of the arguments introduced by the opponents of addad which alleges that this so-called linguistic feature engendered confusion between the speaker and listener, depleting the unity of identity between the ism and the musammd (nomen and nominatum). Ibn al-Anbari dismisses such objections by emphasizing the importance of context and circumstance. The notion of addad was also rationalized by invoking the role played by dialectal enterprise, as was the case with taraduf. the successive positing of meanings to terms, although in the case of addad the meanings are antithetical. It was also maintained that this was a deliberate stylistic feature of the language of the Arabs and that the context always elucidated the appropriate meaning.78 The principal linguistic authorities who are quoted by Ibn al Anbari include the Kufans al-Kisa'i, al-Farra', Ibn al-Sikkit, Abu TJbayd, and Thaclab; the Basrans include al-AsmacI, Abu Zayd al-Ansari, Abu cUbayda and Qutrub. That this was a peculiar philological phenomenon which had fascinated the earliest linguists is confirmed in al-Farra"s Macdnl al-Qur'dn. In one particular instance he mentions the term cascas occurring in Q.81:17. He states that it is unanimously agreed upon by the mufassirun that it denotes 'departing'; however, he reports that 'some of our companions claim that cascas [means] to draw near and become dark.'79 This passage along with additional material is quoted by Ibn al-Anbari. The Basran Abu Tayyib also defended the thesis of addad against its detractors, dismissing the state ments of those who questioned its existence, although he was eager to make a distinc tion between antithesis and contrariety.80 The monumental lexicons also contained sections devoted to addad. Ibn Slda's Mukhassas was familiar with the texture of arguments presented to support homonyms and synonyms; despite mentioning that one of his mentors had denied this thesis, he uses similar arguments to justify the incidence of addad in the language of the Arabs.81 Despite the strictures ostensibly imposed by the doctrine of the revelationist nature of the origin of language, the Kufan and Basran linguists espoused philological theories which greatly undermined the relevance of such a doctrine. However, as one noticed with the grammarians' approach to the linguistic configuration of scripture, an accept ance of its sacrosanct nature was never in question and yet these figures would continue to pursue vigorously abstract speculation which clearly undermined scrip ture's linguistic superiority. A parallel situation prevailed in the field of philology: theories which undermined tawqif al-lugha, a spontaneous doctrine whose kernel was ingenuously extrapolated from Qur'anic and prophetic dicta, were pursued without consideration for the consequences for an accepted orthodoxy. Nevertheless, it was altogether ironic that their philological endeavours actually exposed the deficiencies inherent in this doctrine, allowing the jurists to sanction a non-committal approach to tawqif, but equally providing ammunition for those wishing to pursue sectarian agendas. However, the second aspect of this issue poses the question why a pious</page><page sequence="16">42 Journal of Qur'anic Studies figure such as Ibn Darastawayhi should obstinately refuse to recognize linguistic phenomena which al-Shafici previously identified as irrefutable features of the idiom of Arabic? It would appear that scholars sought refuge in a doctrine of tawqif al-lugha to ward off sectarian attempts to foreshadow an insidious interpretation of scripture which supported their theological bents, exploiting philological and grammatical theo ries; hence the prescient nature of Ibn Darastawayhi's thinking. Moreover, the theological implications were manifest in the arguments concerning the haqiqa-majdz dichotomy, while tawqif and istilah were intrinsic parts of the rubric. Thus Ibn Taymiyya's reference to the question of tawqif al-lugha was a deliberate attempt to regain the initiative for the proponents of orthodoxy. He was not interested in the extremist tawqif doctrine as implied by Weiss, but his specific aim was to repress the application of metaphorical and figurative meanings to the resolution and interpreta tion of the language of scripture and to undermine the dogmatic suppositions which inevitably flowed from this, as we shall see.

We should note that the Basrans ruled that the verb was derived from the masdar and that it was also its branch; conversely, the Kufans regarded the verb as the root and the masdar the branch.

They could be traced to separate dialectal sources. Ibn Durayd's Jamharat al-lugha states that grammarians suggest a separate tribal origin for these terms; while philologists speak of qalb.

Ibn Jinni, al-Khasd'is, vol. 1, p. 372.</page><page sequence="20">46 Journal of Qur'anic Studies He forwards a thesis of tawaduc in relation to the origin of taraduf, suggesting that it is induced by creative needs. 65 Al-Suyutl, al-Muzhir, vol. 1, p. 406. 66 Ibid., pp. 405-6. 67 Ibid., p. 404. 68 Abu Hilal al-cAskari, al-Hasan ibn cAbd Allah, al-Furuq al-lughawiyya, ed. J. D. al-Qudsi, p. 11. 69 Philological works also sought the origin of synonyms in the phonological devices of qalb, ibddl and hadhf, in addition to tribal idiosyncrasies, solecisms, deliberate fabrication and Arabized terms. 70 Cf. cA'isha bint al-Shati', al-Tjdz al-baydni li 'l-Qur'dn wa-masd'il Ibn al-Azraq (Cairo, Dar al-Macarif, 1971), pp. 193-4 and pp. 215 f; in which the phenomenon is rejected. 71 Weiss, Search, p. 124; cf. al-RazI, al-Mahsul, vol. 1, pp. 93-5. 72 Al-ShawkanT, Muhammad, Irshad al-fuhul ild al-tahqiq min Him al-usul (Beirut, Dar al Fikr, n.d.), p. 19. I should suggest that the rejection / denial of taraduf"by Ibn al-Acrabi and Thaclab had little to do with upholding the doctrine of tawqif al-lugha. 73 Ibn Darastawayhi, Tashlh al-faslh, p. 359. His statement rejecting ishtirak refutes addad. 74 The term is also used to describe the rising of a corpulent girl servant or a laden riding beast. It has its Qur'anic usage in reference to the treasury keys of Pharaoh, Q. 28:76. 75 Ibn Faris, al-Sdhibi, p. 117. 76 Al-Suyutl, al-Muzhir, vol. 1, pp. 387-402. 77 Ibn al-Anbari, al-Addad, pp. 1 f. 78 Ibid., pp. 11-12. 79 Al-Farra', Abu Zakariyya Yahya ibn Ziyad, Macdni al-Qur'dn, ed. M. Najjar, A. Najati (3 vols., Cairo, 1980), 3:242; cf. Ibn al-Anbari, Addad, pp. 32-4. 80 cAbd al-Wahid al-LughawI, Kitdb al-adddd fi kalam al-carab, ed. Tzzat Hasan (2 vols., Damascus, Matbucat al-Majmac al-Tlml, 1963). This is evident in the opening remarks of Abu Tayyib, pp. 1-3. 81 Ibn Sida, Mukhassas, vol. 12, pp. 258-65. The term qur' was used to determine the course of a divorce, some claimed that it referred to the state of tuhr (purity); others the state of hayd (menses). Ibn al-Anbari said the Hijazis took the former view; the Iraqis the latter one. Simi larly, some questioned whether all the senses of ishtirak could be simultaneously applied to texts. Addad, pp. 27-32 and Irshad, pp. 21-6. Cf. M. H. Kamall, Principles of Islamic Jurispru dence (Cambridge, Islamic Texts Society, 1991), p. 119; al-Shawkani, Irshad, p. 21, who also mentions the dispute amongst scholars in choosing whether majaz or ishtirak preponderate in words displaying both qualities, pp. 26-7.</page></plain_text>
