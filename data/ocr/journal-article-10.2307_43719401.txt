<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Seeing God" in the Psalms: The Background to the Beatific Vision in the Hebrew Bible MARK S. SMITH Yale University New Haven, CT 06520 In his three-volume commentary on the Psalms, M. Dahood offered the thesis that numerous passages in the Psalter point to an ancient Israelite belief in the "beatific vision." More specifically, Dahood argued that some psalms indicate a hope in "beholding God throughout eternity, in afterlife."1 According to Dahood, the passages that reflect this belief are Pss 1 1:7; 16:1 1; 17:15; 21:7; 27:4,13; 36:10; 42:3; 61:8; 63:3; and 140:14.2 In order to test Dahood's proposal, L. Dorn has recently reexamined these passages. In his doctoral dissertation, Dorn demonstrates that none of the texts that Dahood offers in evidence for the "beatific vision" refers to the afterlife.3 Dorn's refutation leaves one important question unanswered. Some of the passages that Dahood cites to support his case for the "beatific vision" speak in var- ious ways of "seeing God." Referring to God, Ps 1 1:7 records the proverbial 1 M.

Commenting on Ps 11:7, e.g., some scholars argue that this language reflects the psalmists9 awakening from death.11 Other writers think that the five passages cited above reflect the resolution of a judicial ordeal in the morning following a time of testing at night.12 Still others focus on the experience as a cultic theophany or special vision from Yahweh.13 The first view, as we have noted, has been refuted in some detail by Dorn.14 While the second view is not incompatible with the third approach 8 Author's translation.

Barré, "An Unrecognized Precative Construction in Phoenician and Hebrew," Bib 64 (1983) 414-21. 9 In general, the language of seeing God was not taken literally in rabbinic tradition (cf. the Shicûr Qõmã) and in the versions, apparently due to the anthropomorphism felt to be inappropriate of God (see Fritsch, "Greek Translations," 51 *-56*). 10 On seeing the deity in Mesopotamian and Egyptian texts, see F.

Keel summarizes the Egyptian and Mesopotamian evidence: "In Egypt, as in Mesopotamia, the expression could be understood literally as a gazing upon the image or emblem of the deity" (p. 201). In the Jerusalem temple, the divine throne was left empty (see J. Morgenstern, The Fire upon the Altar [Leiden: Brill, 1963] 37-38 n. 2). In the prophetic tradition, most notably in Isaiah 6 and Ezekiel 1 (see below, n. 43), the throne was filled by the divine presence conceived of as having human form and superhuman size. 11 R.

Rather, seeing God's pãním belongs to the wider semantic field of the light of the divine face. For example, Yahweh's face sends light to worshipers in Pss 4:7; 89:16; and 90:8. 15 Psalmists sometimes request that God allow his face to shine on them. In Ps 31:17, the lamenter asks for the light of God's face: "Let your face shine on your servant" ( hďíra pãnêkã cal-cabdekā). In its threefold refrain, Psalm 80 (w 4,8, and 20) uses the image of God's face shining as a positive expression for divine salvation or approval. These psalms, as well as other passages (such as Pss 34:6; 67:2; 1 19:25; Num 6:24- 26), indicate that the light of God's shining face is used as an expression for God's favor or blessing.16 Finally, acts of worship are directed toward Yahweh's face in Pss 22:28; 24:6; 68:4; 86:9; and 141:2. In these passages, pãním refers to divine presence.17 15 McKay, "Psalms of Vigil," 229 n. 2; cf. Levenson, "A Technical Meaning," 61-67; see n. 22 for the second-millennium background of this motif. On "light of the face" (^ôr paním) and related expressions, see M. I. Gruber, Aspects of Nonverbal Communication in the Ancient Near East (Studia Pohl 12/ II; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1980) 557-98, esp. 557-70. 16 M . Fishbane, "Form and Reformulation of the Biblical Priestly Blessing," JAOS 103 (1983) 115-21, esp. 116. 17 The noun pãním often means "face" literally, though it also denotes "presence" more generally (BDB, 816; cf. 818). In some instances (such as 2 Sam 17:1 1; cf. Rashi on Exod 33:14, in Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth and Rashi 's Commentary [ New York: Hebrew Publishing Co., 1963] 189), pãním may stand for the person generally. Confirmation of this view can be found where the expression "to see the face of a human being refers to seeing a person (Gen 33:10; Exod 10:28-29). The way this expression is applied to humans in the Bible is analogous to the way the expression is applied to Yahweh (for a comparable argument in the realm of prayer, see M. Greenberg, Biblical Prose Prayer As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel [Berkeley/ Los Angeles/ London: University of California, 1983] 19-37). For the range of the Biblical Hebrew pãním, see A. R. Johnson, "Aspects of the Use of the Term o'jç in the Old Testament," Festschrift Otto Eissfeldt zum 60. Geburtstag 1 September 1947 (ed. J. Flick; Halle: Niemeyer, 1947) 155-59; T. W. Mann, Divine Presence and Guidance in Israelite TYadition: The typology of Exaltation (Baltimore/ London: Johns Hopkins, 1977) 257-58. Uga- ritic pn usually means "face," except in the preposition Ipn, "before" (cf. Biblical Hebrew lipne), and in the inscription, Ras Shamra 25.318 (see UT 19. 2356; and M. Dietrich and O. Loretz, "Die keilalphabetische Krugausschrift RS 25.318," Ugaritica *7 [ed. C. F. A. Schaeffer; Mission de Ras Shamra 18; Paris: P. Geuthner; Leiden: Brill, 1978] 147-48). The inscription, found on a lion rhyton, calls the rhyton pn ^arw, literally, "the face of the lion." In this case, pn means representation or image. Not only may this usage bear on the biblical expression "to see the face of," but it may also represent in the secular realm what Punic tnt pn bcl means in the sacred realm, i.e., a representation of someone. (On tnt pn bcl, see DISO, 229; F. M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, 1973] 28; R. A.

The</page><page sequence="5">"SEEING GOD" IN THE PSALMS 175 The third approach assumes a specific cultic setting of a night vigil that would fit well with Psalms 17, 27, and 63. 18 Ps 17:15 especially might suggest the setting of a night vigil since this verse speaks of seeing God's form upon awakening. Ps 63:7 also points to a night vigil. One might propose on the basis of this evidence that the experience of God occurred at dawn. If so, perhaps the experience of seeing God was a solar theophany at dawn.19 The verb DäSahärekkä, "I will seek you," in Ps 63:2 may form an implicit paro- nomasia on the word šahar "dawn,"20 although the latter appears nowhere in any of the five psalms under discussion. The language of light in Pss 27:1 and 43:3 (cf. 36:10b) might be construed as further evidence, although the language is used figuratively. A morning solar theophany in the temple21 could have been the cultic setting in which the psalmists may have hoped to see God. (It is clear from these psalms that if a theophanic experience was expected, it was not a storm theophany since these psalms contain no storm language.) One problem with the second approach applies to the third as well: a number of psalms that use the language of the light of God's face Ugaritic letter, PRU II, 15 (= Dietrich et al., Texte, 2.16, 11. 6-10 [cited below in n. 22]), attests to both the preposition, Ipn, "before," and the noun pn, "face," which constitutes part of a metaphor for favor shown to a person of inferior status by a superior. 18 McKay, "Psalms of Vigil," 232-35. While the other two psalms, Psalms 1 1 and 42-43, are not set in a night vigil, they could be explained as referring to the experience of a morning theophany. 19 For reconstructions of solar theophany in ancient Israel, see K.

Akkadian s/šahāru ( CAD S, 37-54, esp. 41). I wish to thank one of the reviewers of this essay for pointing out this etymology to me. 21 To my knowledge no scholar goes so far as proposing a solar theophany at dawn as the setting for these psalms.

A study by M. Fishbane suggests an alternative explanation that utilizes the insights gained through the first three approaches. Fishbane argues that the language of God's shining face was part of Israel's inheritance from ancient Near Eastern culture. With reference to the Priestly Blessing (PB) of Num 6:24-26, Fishbane says: The various and abundant references to the PB in the Psalter, but particularly the recurrence of similar language there and in many biblical genres, where a di- rect use of the language of the PB cannot be posited as its source, suggest that such imagery as 'shining the face' in favor, or 'raising the face' in beneficence, and so on, were widely diffused throughout the culture. And more: the various and abundant use of such imagery in ancient Near Eastern literature, particular- ly from Mesopotamia where it recurs in a wide range of genres, suggests that an- cient Israel absorbed such imagery as part and parcel of its rich patrimony.22 The language of light used of the divine may have derived from the great religious traditions of ancient Near Eastern culture. As part of the language of divine light, "seeing God" and "seeing God's face" may have been part of this inheritance. In addition, the language of the "shining of the face" and other phrases utilizing the language of light with respect to God's face, including "seeing God's face," overlapped with the solar imagery applied to Yahweh. An examination of the solar imagery for God may help to explain the meaning and usage of the language of "seeing God" in Psalms 11, 17, 27, 42-43, and 63. Deut 33:2 may be the oldest example of solar language for Yahweh, if the eleventh- or tenth-century date proposed for this verse is accurate:23 22 Fishbane, "Form and Reformulation," 1 16. For example, see PRU II, 15 (= Dietrich et al., Texte, 2.16, 11. 6-10), in which Talmiyanu relates to his mother, Thariyelli, his audience before the king: &gt;umy tdc ky crbt Ipn špš wpn špš nr by mHd, "My mother, you must know that I have entered before the 'Sun' and the face of the 'Sun* shone upon me greatly" (see D.

Meyers has noted,24 the language is patently solar. In this passage, the verb for the rising of the sun, zrh , is used to describe the divine proces- sion. In Isa 60:1, the verb is also applied to the going forth of God. This verb appears as well in Biblical Hebrew and inscriptional personal names with the theophoric element.25 Thus, solar language is used to describe God's own light. Solar imagery for God is found also in Ps 84: 12, which calls God "a sun and a shield" (šemeš ūmāgēn ).26 While this language is figurative, it assumes that the divine could be described in solar terms. Psalm 84 is of further help especially for exploring the language of seeing God in Psalms 42-43, since Psalms 42-43 and 84 share the same setting of a pilgrim longing for the experience of the living God in the temple. Like Ps 42:3, Ps 84:9b speaks of [1977] 158-69) argues for a Davidic setting for the poem. G. von Rad (Deuteronomy. A Com- mentary [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966] 208) dates Deuteronomy 33 to the ninth or early eighth century. Other scholars who propose an eighth-century date include A. D. H.

These later dates proposed for the formation of the poem of Deuteronomy 33 do not preclude an earlier date for v 2. 24 C. L.

The verb zrh is also applied to Yahweh once in the Kuntillet cAjrûd inscriptions (M. Weinfeld, "Kuntillet cAjrûd Inscriptions and Their Significance," Studi epigrafici e lin- guistici 1 [1984] 126).

McCarter (II Samuel [AB 9; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1984] 484) repoints MT ūmāgēn to ūmāgān and translates "sovereign." In this case, šemeš ūmāgān would refer to Yahweh as a divine suzerain who bestows favor and honor. McCarter's interpretation points to the royal background to the solar language in this verse and in Mai 3:20 (see n. 27). Solar language for the monarch in 2 Sam 23:4 (cf. Hos 6:3) likewise raises the possibility that royal circles provided the source for solar language for describing Yahweh.</page><page sequence="8">178 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 50, 1988 God being seen in Zion. Seeing God is therefore found in a context that explicitly applies solar language to God. Besides Deut 33:2 and Ps 84:12, Mai 3:2027 and Isa 58:828 also connect solar imagery with divine light. A solar description of the procession of God's kābod ("glory") may be implied in the deuteronomistic critique of solar devotion in 2 Kings 23. In its denunciation of the Yahwistic solar cult, 2 Kgs 23:11 includes the "chariots of the sun" ( markêbôt haššemeS). The picture is apparently one of chariots carrying the sun on its course, being pulled by horses (as perhaps suggested by Hab 3:8). The archaeological record may add to this picture. Horse fig- urines with a sun disk above their heads have been discovered at Iron Age levels at Lachish, Hazor, and Jerusalem.29 The uppermost register of the tenth-century Taanach stand likewise bears a horse with a sun disk above its body.30 At Ramat Rahel, two seals that may also be pertinent depict bulls with solar disks between their horns.31 Finally, the imagery of divine wings in Pss 17:18 and 63:7 (and also 36:7; 57:1; 61:4; etc.) invites comparison with 27 See Smith, "Helios in Palestine," 205*; Stähli, Solare Elemente , 39. 28 Isa 58:8 prophesies that the going forth of the righteous will be brilliant like that of the dawn, with Yahweh as the rear guard (see J. Morgenstern, "Biblical Theophanies," ZA 28 [1914] 47-48). See also Ps97:ll in the LXX and Syriac. This analysis of the solar theophany has implications for other biblical texts. Psalm 19, e.g., has been considered a polemic against non-Israelite sun-worship (see N. Sarna, "Psalm XIX and the Near Eastern Sun-god Litera- ture, M Fourth World Congress of Jewish Studies Papers I [Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Studies, 1967] 171-75). Yet Psalm 19 has no overtones of polemic against solar worship. On the contrary, the sun and the torah serve analogous functions of witnessing to the God of the sun and the torah. Even if a polemic lay behind Psalm 19, as Sarna argues, it well may be that the solar practice was indigenous (see below, n. 34). See also Stähli, Solare Elemente, 17-20. 29 See T. Holland, "A Study of Palestinian Iron Age Baked Clay Figurines with Special Reference to Jerusalem: Cave 1," Levant 9 (1977) 141, 149-51; Ahlström, An Archaeological Picture of Iron Age Religions, 22.

McKay, "Further Light on the Horses and Chariots of the Sun in the Jerusalem Temple (2 Kings 23:11)," PEQ 105 (1973) 167-69. A bilingual text from Boghazköi refers to horses of Shamash (see J. S. Cooper, "Bilinguals from Boghazköi. II," ZA 62 [1972] 71, 76). 30 See A. E. Glock, "Taanach," Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land (4 vols.; ed. M. Avi-Yonah and E. Stern; Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society and Masad, 1978) 4. 1,142, 1,147. 31 The seals come from level 4b, which could date to the Iron Age, as is argued by Ahlström (An Archaeological Picture of Iron Age Religions, 22), following Y. Aharoni ("Ex- cavations at Ramat Rahel," RA 24 [1961] 106 and fig. 9). Aharoni later opted, however, for a Persian period date (see Aharoni, Excavations at Ramat Rahel; Seasons 1959 and 1960 [Rome: Centro di Studi Semitici, 1962] 10, 34 and pl. 30:81; Excavations at Ramat Rahel; Seasons 1961 and 1962 [Rome: Centro di Studi Semitici, 1964] 21, 45 and pl. 21:8).</page><page sequence="9">"SEEING GOD" IN THE PSALMS 179 the winged sun disks represented on preexilic seals, although the imagery could have been assimilated with the cherubim in Israelite tem- ple iconography.32 The procession of God's "glory" ( kãbôd) described in Ezek 43:1-5 per- haps combines solar language with storm imagery. The divine glory is in part like the cosmic waters, as it is said to be deafening, "like the mighty waters."33 The kãbôd seems to proceed like the procession of the sun, since it came from the east, lighting up the earth as it went. The combination of storm and solar language in Ezek 43:1-5 raises an important issue. By com- bining two types of natural phenomena, this passage may be suggesting that the nature of God is so great that it incorporates aspects of both types. It may also indicate that God's appearance was considered so great that it could not be identified easily with, or reduced to, one natural phenomenon. In effect, God is above the language of natural phenomena; God is truly "super-natural." (This is compatible with Ezekiel's criticism of solar cult in the temple of Ezek 8:16.)34 Job 38:28-29 and Isa 42:13-14 (cf. Ps 27:10 and Isa 45:10) exhibit an analogous phenomenon. These passages combine male and female language for God both to dramatize the divine care for Israelites and to emphasize the ultimate transcendence of God beyond hu- man description.35 32 See Smith, "Helios in Palestine," 204*-5*, 212M3« n. 52; cf. McKay, "Psalms of Vigil," 235. For a survey of the winged sun disk in the ancient Near East, see G. Mendenhall, The Tenth Generation. The Origins of the Biblical Dradition (Baltimore/ London: Johns Hopkins, 1973) 32-66. The iconography of Punic Bacl IJamôn and Ugaritic El (with whom B. Landsberger and F M. Cross identify Bacl 11 amõn) includes the winged sun disk (see Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 35). According to the Phoenician History of Philo of Byblos, Kronos (= El) had wings (see H. W. Attridge and R. A. Oden, Philo of Byblos The Phoenician History [CBQMS 9; Washington: The Catholic Biblical Association of America, 1981] 56-69). 33 On the motif of the "many waters," see H. G. May, "Some Cosmic Connotations of Mayim rabbim, 'Many Waters,'" JBL 74 (1955) 17. 34 There is an issue as to whether or not the solar worship criticized in Ezek 8:16 was a foreign import or genuinely Yahwistic. H. Schmidt and W. Eichrodt, e.g., consider the devotion to be that of Shamash (Eichrodt, Ezekiel. A Commentary [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1970] 127). M. Greenberg (Ezekiel 1-20 [AB 22; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1983] 172) considers possible Aramaic influence. W. Zimmerli ( Ezekiel 1 [Hermeneia; Philadelphia: For- tress, 1979] 244) thinks that Ezek 8:16 describes "solarized Yahwistic worship," although he allows for possible external influence. This approach may pose a false dichotomy between being a foreign import and being a genuinely Yahwistic element (see Stähli, Solare Elemente, 48-49). 35 See P. Trible, God and the Rhetoric of Sexuality (Overtures to Biblical Theology; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1978) 67-69; L. Swidler, Biblical Affirmations of Woman (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1979) 33-35; M.

Smith, "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and His</page><page sequence="10">180 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 50, 1988 Ezek 43:1-5 is not anomalous in combining language from different realms of nature to describe God's appearance. Ps 50:1-3 also combines language from two different realms of nature. In vv lb-2, solar language is applied to God, while v 3 uses the image of the sirocco for the divine pro- cession. Similarly, numerous passages combine the language of the rainstorm and the sirocco.36 An enameled tile from the reign of the ninth-century neo-Assyrian monarch, Tukulti-Ninurta II,37 provides an analogue to the description of the divine in Ezek 43:1-5 and 2 Sam 23:4. The tile depicts the god Assur38 riding the winged sun disk with his drawn bow aimed at the enemies of the king. On either side are storm clouds with rain falling. One may compare also Enuma Elish 1, 11. 101-2 and 157, and VI, 11. 128-29, which apply solar qualities to Marduk, although storm language is more charac- teristic of him.39 The depiction of Assur and the description of Marduk exalt them by attributing different natural powers to them much as Yahweh is exalted in Ezek 43:1-5 and Ps 50:1-3. Solar language was used in a variety of metaphors for Yahweh, from the God who dawns like the sun (Deut 33:2) to simply being the sun (Ps 84:12). The solar language was also used flexibly to describe divine presence or 'asherah,'" TS 48 (1987) 333-40, esp. 340 n. 25. While some of Miller's criticisms of Trible's work are legitimate, he misses a salient point concerning the passages that Trible cites in regard to the female dimension of Yahweh (such as Deut 32:18 [cf. Jer 2:27]; Pss 22:29; 131:2; Isa 42: 14; 49:15; 66:9; and perhaps Num 11:12). The innovative character of these passages supports the point Trible argues, viz., that Yahweh encompasses and transcends the categories of sexuality and hence overcomes the limited characterization of a male deity, the biblical description of Yahweh which Miller attempts to uphold. Furthermore, Miller makes some appeal to compar- isons between Yahweh and other gods, but omits comparisons that might be drawn between Yahweh and goddesses (such as Asherah or Anat). Female roles for gods (and vice-versa?) might be posited on the basis of personal names such as Ugaritic Utr^um, "Athtar is mother" (cf. Htr^ab, "Athtar is father"), Hlcnt, "Anat is (a) god," Akkadian ummi-šamaš, "Shamash is mother," or a-da-nu-um-mu, "the Lord is mother" (F.

See also Gudea Cylinder B, V 109, which depicts the return of Ningirsu to his temple with storm and solar imagery (G. A.

This background may help to interpret the language of seeing God in Psalms 1 1, 17, 27, 42-43, and 63. The language of seeing God in Ps 11:7 expresses the traditional wisdom that seeing God was a mark of divine blessing or approval (as in Psalms 4, 3 1 , 80, etc.). Ps 17: 15 describes the expectation of seeing the divine "face." As pānīm may mean "presence," the psalmist may have expected to experience qualities of the divine presence and not a solar theophany at all. The parallel stich in Ps 17:15b, "I shall be satisfied with beholding your form" ( Dešběcá bèhâqîs tēmūnātekā ), and the rest of the psalm as well, inspire little confidence that a solar theophany is what the psalmist expected. On the contrary, the em- phasis falls on the divine presence characterized by the divine "face" and "form." The use of both these words suggests that the psalm used two tra- ditional words for divine presence. Like seeing the divine "form" in Psalm 17, seeing God's "beauty" (?) ( nõcam ) and "goodness" (?) (tûb) in Ps 27:4,13 does not point to solar theo- phany. If the figurative image in Ps 27:1 is any indication, the psalmist ex- pects divine favor. Verse 14 adds to this impression, since the psalmist does not expect this favor in an imminent cultic experience, but during his life- time. Psalms 42-43 perhaps offer the best case of a psalmist's hope for a solar theophany. Yet the language of light is paired with "truth" in 43:3, thus denoting a general quality of the divine. In this case, "to see (rDh) the face of God" may be metaphorical for experiencing the divine presence, as the verb rDh has a wide range of meaning, including "to experience" (as in Jer 5:12 and Ps 89:49).40 Ps 63:3 recalls a past experience41 of "seeing God," which is one of divine power and glory. The psalmist's experience in this case suggests a real immediacy of divine presence, as in Pss 17:15; 27:4; and 42:3. The divine presence is described, however, in general terms that never specify the divine experience as solar in character. The experience of God in all these psalms is never reduced to solar language. However, these psalms draw on the lan- guage of light to magnify the impact of the experience of the divine. As psalms of vigil, Psalms 17, 27, and 63 do not reduce the experience of God's presence to a solar theophany; but it is possible that the experience of the dawn after the night vigil helped to evoke the perception of the luminescent dimension of the divine presence. "Seeing God" thus represents the culmi- nating experience in the temple. Going to the temple re-presented the ex- perience of paradise with the elements of cherubim, palm trees, gold, water, abundant food, etc., and this included the divine presence. 40 See also BDB, 907. The perfect may be precative in force (so Dahood, Psalms II. 1-50, 97).</page><page sequence="12">182 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 50, 1988 Pss 11:7; 17:15; 27:4; and 63:3 may resemble the prophetic visions of Isaiah and Ezekiel, whose "seeing" (hzh)42 the divine incorporates the lan- guage of light (see especially Ezek 1:27; cf. seraphim in Isaiah 6).43 What the psalmists experienced of the divine in the temple was too great to reduce to natural phenomenon, although they adapted the language of light to capture one aspect of experiencing the divine.44 Perhaps the psalmists experienced God just as Moses,45 Isaiah, and Ezekiel did - as a superhuman-sized deity, 42 See R. R. Wilson, Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1980) 254-71 on hzh as a special prophetic mode of vision. 43 On Ezekiel 1 (in addition to the commentaries), see Morgenstern, "Biblical Theopha- nies," ZA 28 (1914) 39-42; G. von Rad, "doxa," TDNT 2 (1964) 240-41; M.

Ishida; Tokyo: Yamakawa-Shuppansha, 1982) 109-38. See also M. S. Smith, "Divine Form and Size in Ugaritic and Israelite Religion," ZAW (in press). 44 The prophets* experience of the divine does not include terms found in the psalmists' divine experience, such as tèmûnâ, "form," or tûb, "goodness" (?). The relationship in the Psalms between prophetic vision and seeing God is unclear. Y. Kaufmann (The Religion of Israel. From Its Beginning to the Babylonian Exile [New York: Schocken, 1974] 236) calls the experience of seeing God in the Psalter a "subsidiary aspect of prophetic seeing." (In this connection, one may note that Symmachus adds "in a vision" to Exod 24:10.) On the relation- ship of psalms and prophecy in general, see Wilson, Prophecy and Society in Ancient Israel, 259-60; and W. H. Bellinger, Psalmody and Prophecy (JSOTSup 27; Sheffield: JSOT, 1984). 45 Moses* experience of the divine in Exodus 33-34 uses the same terminology as in the Psalms, although in Exodus 33-34 and elsewhere it plays a larger theological role in the prob- lems of Yahweh's relationship to the people and Moses* special relationship to God (see B. S. Childs, The Book of Exodus [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1974] 593-97). It is clear from Exod 24:9-1 1 that at some point in the tradition (and probably an earlier one if the pre-JE date as argued by Childs [The Book of Exodus, 501] is correct), one could see God and live. It was, to be sure, a special sign of divine blessing and approval (see also Gen 32:31 and Judg 6:22-23). The word tèmûnâ is absent from the dialogue in Exodus 33, but see Num 12:8; cf. Deut 4: 12 (see Childs, The Book of Exodus, 343). In Exod 33:13, Moses requests to be shown dērākekā, often translated as "your (i.e., God's) way(s)" in accordance with the Vulgate's tuam viam and the Tg. Onqelos's V rh twbk (see on this N. M. Waldman "God's Ways- A Comparative Note,"/ßR 70 [1979-80] 67-72; for the text of Tg. Onqelos, see A. Sperber [ed.], The Bible in Aramaic. Vol. I. The Pentateuch according to Targum Onkelos [Leiden: Brill, 1959] 148. LXX B uses seauton, "yourself," in this verse to translate the Biblical Hebrew's dērākekā. This fact may suggest that the meaning of dērākekā in the LXX was not "way," but another aspect of the divine, such as</page><page sequence="13">"SEEING GOD" IN THE PSALMS 183 human in form and dazzling in light.46 If so, solar language was used to capture the luminescent component of the divine presence in the temple. Before closing, it may be appropriate to complete this discussion of the biblical motif of "seeing God" by returning to Dahood's thesis that Psalms 11, 17, 27, 42-43, and 63 reflect Israelite belief in the beatific vision. Dahood's hypothesis may be modified in light of the preceding discussion. The beatific vision in the Bible, strictly speaking, is found only in NT pas- sages, such as Matt 5:8 and 1 John 1:5, 7.47 Other NT sections, like 1 Cor 13:1 1-12 and 2 Cor 3:18, describe the incipience of seeing God in this life, with the fullness and clarity of this experience to be realized in heaven.48 The NT language of seeing God in the afterlife was modeled on the escha- tological language of seeing God in the OT, as found in Second Isaiah. Isa 40:5 (cf. 35:2 and 52:10) announces that all humanity shall see the glory of God when God comes to deliver Israel. Like Ezek 43:1-5, this description of God projects into the future the present, paradisiacal experience of the divine conveyed by the psalms that speak of seeing God. This language in the Psalms belongs to the larger semantic field of the light of the divine face that overlapped with the solar language applied to God in Israelite tradition. "glory" (as kãbôd is often translated). Scholars have noted the attestation of the Biblical He- brew's derek as "dominion" for over fifty years (see W. F. Albright, "The North Canaanite Poems of APêyan Bacal and the 'Gracious Gods,'" JPOS 14 [1934] 130 n. 153; idem, "The Oracles of Balaam," JBL 63 [1944] 219 n. 82, 225; M. Dahood, "Ugaritic Durand biblical DEREK," TS 15 [1954] 627-31), and this meaning of derek suits the context of Exod 33:13. If Moses were asking to see a manifestation of God's derek , "power," in Exod 33:13, this would accord well with the other terms in this dialogue, i.e., all referring to some type of divine manifestation. (I thank John Strugnell for suggesting this possibility to me.) For a treatment of this passage, see R. W. L. Moberly, At the Mountain of God. Story and Theology in Exodus 32-34 (JSOTSup 22; Sheffield: JSOT, 1983) 66-187. On Exod 34:6-7, see K. D. Sakenfeld, The Meaning o/hesed in the Hebrew Bible: A New Inquiry (HSM 17; Missoula, MT: Scholars, 1978) 1 12-22. Both Childs (The Book of Exodus, 506) and Greenberg ( Ezekiel 1-20, 50) connect Exod 24:9-11 with Ezek 1 :26. Both passages indicate that the persons involved see into the very heavens of God's abode. This fact is borne out by the detail of the "sapphire" (Ugaritic thrm HqnHm, "lapis lazuli"), an element in the construction of Baal's house in CTA 4.5.81, 96-97 (= Dietrich et al., Texte, 1.4 V 19, 34-35); noted by Childs, The Book of Exodus, 506; U.
