Medical Center Milwaukee, Wl Gerald Harris Marquette University Milwaukee, Wl Gautam Ray Florida International University Miami, FL ABSTRACT In vitro biomechanical studies were conducted on fresh human cadaveric thoracolumbar spines to establish the limits of tolerance, explain the mechanism of failure, and investigate the effects of improvement in strength and stability of the injured column using Harrington distraction rods, Luque rods and modified Weiss springs. Quasistatic axial tensile loading on ligaments, compressive loads on vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, and flexure and compression-flexion force vectors on ligamentous columns, intact torsos and injured spines were applied to delineate the biomechanical and functional patho-anatomic characteristics. Vertical drop tests were conducted with the Hybrid II manikin to predict the forces and accelerations on the vertebral column. INTRODUCTION The purpose of the human spinal column is to support and distribute the mechanical load. Although many factors contribute to dysfunction, finally, it is the ability of the structure to effectively withstand and transfer both static and dynamic loads (insult) that determines its integrity and mechanical stability. Insults to the spine occur routinely in vehicular accidents. A quantitative assessment of the functional changes secondary to the application of these adverse insults is an important step towards improved treatment of injury or improved design of vehicular environment. The study of isolated spinal components such as vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs and ligaments (micro- models) helps to delineate response of the structure without other variables such as spinal curvature. In addition, these studies can provide base line data to construct a detailed mathematical model of the spine [2]. On the other hand, experimental models employing the entire vertebral column (macro-models), isolated or intact, are essential to understand the mechanism of injury and the limits of tolerance under various injury producing force vectors [3]. The effects of stabilization can be best investigated using these models. In this study, we have determined the failure response and mechanism of injury to the human thoracolumbar spine using micro and macro-models. * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. ANATOMICAL OVERVIEW The spinal column is composed of 24 individual vertebrae and 2 composite vertebrae, the sacrum and the coccyx. Of the 24 individual vertebrae, there are 7 cervical vertebrae in the neck, 12 thoracic vertebrae which support ribs, and 5 lumbar vertebrae (Figurei). There are five fused vertebrae in the sacrum. The coccygeal vertebrae is formed by the fusion of four separate bodies. The most prominent feature of the vertebra is the body located anteriorly, from which the vertebral arch extends posteriorly. This arch is composed of the pedicle which protrudes posteriorly from the body; the articular facets, having both superior and inferior portions; and the laminae, which come together posteriorly to close the arch. The vertebral foramen is thus formed, through which the spinal cord and its coverings pass. Extending laterally from the vertebral arch is the transverse process and extending posteriorly from the lamina is the spinous process. The vertebrae are interconnected anteriorly by the disc between each successive vertebral body, and posteriorly by a synovial joint between superior and inferior articular facets of adjacent vertebrae. The thoracic vertebrae have the same prominent features as the lumbar vertebrae with a few exceptions. Since the thoracic vertebrae support the rib cage, there are facets for the ribs both on the vertebral body and on each transverse process. The vertebral bodies of the thoracic vertebrae are generally more heart-shaped and their spinous processes point in an inferior- posterior direction. The spinal column is composed of 23 intervertebral discs. The discs, which together account for one-third to one-fifth of spinal column length, generally increase in geometry proceeding down the spinal column. Each intervertebral disc has two major components: the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus. The nucleus pulposus is centrally located and is composed of a very fine network of fibers within a mucopolysaccharide gel. It has a very high water content, but is found to stiffen and degenerate with age. The nucleus is surrounded by the annulus fibrosus which is a composition of collagenous fibers arranged in helical bands. The fiber direction is such that it makes approximately a 30 degree angle to the disc plane, but in the adjacent bands the fibers run in the opposite direction to make a 120 degree angle with the fibers of the previous band. 5.676 0096-736X/89/9705-0676$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">881331 Figure 1 Antero-lateral (left), lateral (middle), and postero-lateral (right) views of the human spinal column. There are seven cervical, twelve thoracic, and five lumbar vertebrae, with 23 Intervertebral disks. Between the disc and the vertebral body Iles a very thin (0.2 - 2 mm) cartilaginous endplate. The fibers of the annulus Insert in the endplate to complete the Intervertebral joint. Comparatively little is known about the cartilaginous endplate. The anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) are continuous ligaments that run the entire length of the spinal column. The ALL begins at the occiput and continues down to the sacrum covering one-quarter to one-third of the anterior circumference of the vertebral bodies and discs. The PLL begins at the second cervical vertebra and continues to the sacrum with fibers spreading out at the disc level and narrowing at the vertebral body. The PLL attaches to the posterior aspects of the vertebral body and disc just anterior to the spinal cord. Both PLL and ALL have a longitudinal (superior- inferior) fiber direction. The ligamentum flavum (LF) attaches to the superior and inferior surfaces of the laminae of adjacent vertebrae. It is generally V-shaped in cross section and is first seen at the C1 - C2 vertebral level and last seen at the L5 - S1 level. The interspinous ligament (ISL) joins the superior and inferior surfaces of the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae. It begins at C2 - C3 and ends at L5 - S1 level. There has been some discussion as to the fiber direction of the ISL but Heylings [4] has shown by histological examination that the orientation is in the antero inferior to postero superior direction. The fibers of the ISL run into the fibers of the supraspinous ligament (SSL). The SSL begins at the most dorsal aspect of the C 7 spinous process and is continuous into the lumbosacral region. The SSL is the continuation of the elastic ligamentum nuchae in the cervical spine. Researchers have reported the fibers to end any where between L3 and L5 spinal levels among the strong fibers of the lumbodorsal fascia [4,5]. The capsular ligaments (JC) attach to the vertebra adjacent to the facet joints. The fibers are perpendicular to the plane of the facets. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE SPECIMEN SELECTION - Micro-model studies were conducted on 58 fresh human male cadavers to determine the uniaxial failure, tensile strength of spinal ligaments, uniaxial compressive failure strength of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. Macro-model studies using 27 fresh human male cadavers were conducted to understand the mechanism of injury and effect of stabilization of intact and ligamentous thoracolumbar columns. Briefly, all specimens selected for the study were free of bone disease or metastatic cancer. Medical records were reviewed and plain radiographs were taken to select subjects without spinal disease or pre-existing fractures. The spinal column including the intact head and sacrum, was isolated carefully to avoid any soft tissue damage. All specimens were stored at -2 degrees Centigrade and thawed at room temperature 12-20 hours before testing. Handling and preserving in this manner is reported to have no effect on the mechanical properties of bone, disc and ligaments [6,7,8]. The isolated spinal columns, for micro-model studies (ligaments, vertebral bodies, and intervertebral discs), were further dissected to remove the ribs, the attached fat and muscles. The spinal column was then cut into manageable sections. Each ligament was isolated in situ or in its physiologic environment, i.e., it was not removed from its insertion zone [9]. At each disc level, the annulus and all other supporting structures except the ligament under study were transected using a disecting microscope. For isolated vertebral body compression studies, the vertebrae were isolated by transecting the ligamentous spine between bony segments. Soft tissues clinging to the vertebral body were carefully removed without damaging the endplates. The 5.677</page><page sequence="3">posterior elements were transected by sawing through the pedicles. Intervertebral disc experiments were carried out using the functional unit model, i.e., the vertebra-disc-vertebra structure was removed at different levels in the lumbar spine by transecting at the superior and inferior intervertebral disc level of the functional unit. Again, posterior elements were excluded. However, the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments remained intact. Isolated ligamentous columns from T3 - S1 levels were used for compression-flexion and flexure (three and four point bending) loading of the spine. Four intact cadaver torsos were also studied. SPECIMEN MOUNTING MICRO-MODEL STUDIES Ligaments - The ligaments studied included ALL, PLL, LF, JC, ISL and SSL. The in situ preparation was mounted in a specially designed uni-axial tensile testing apparatus which allowed unobstructed movement for the ligament under test by firmly fixing the superior and inferior vertebral bodies (above and below the spinal level under test) with five Steinman pins. The top of the apparatus was attached to the piston of an electrohydraulic Material Testing System (MTS) device while the bottom was fixed to a rigid platform. The longitudinal axis of the ligament coincided with the central axis of the piston ensuring a pure tensile force. Vertebral bodies - The isolated vertebral bodies were positioned between two cylinders with diameters significantly larger than the maximum exposed surface dimension of the structure. The vertebral bodies were compressed uniformly to 50% of original height using the piston of the MTS device. Intervertebral discs - Both the superior and inferior vertebral bodies of the functional units were carefully embedded in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) using a specially designed mold. Only one-third height of the vertebral body was fixed in PMMA. During mounting, care was taken to ensure that the plane at the mid height of the disc was parallel to the top and bottom surface of the prepared specimen. This was achieved by placing levels in two perpendicular directions on the top surface of the functional unit. ALL and PLL remained intact during the embedding operations. MACRO-MODEL STUDIES Ligamentous columns - The isolated spinal columns were fixed at the proximal and distal ends in 150 mm diameter aluminum rings using Steinman pins and blocked with PMMA reinforced with wire. The distal end of the preparation was then clamped firmly to the frame of the MTS device. The proximal end of the column was attached to the MTS piston to apply axial loading. The specimens were oriented at 15 degrees flexion. In flexion experiments (three and four point bending tests), 20 mm diameter greased, stainless steel rods, were inserted through the neural foramina at the cephalad and caudad ends of the spinal column. These rods were then placed on a specially designed apparatus which permitted full movement of the spine to simulate simply supported ends for flexure loading. To study the effect of improvement in the strength and stability of the spine , Harrington distraction rods (HR), Luque rods (LR) and modified Weiss springs (MWS) were used. After initial failure, the specimens were removed from the testing device and MWS were then inserted into the lamina two levels above and below the fractured segment. Then the specimens were repositioned beneath the piston of the MTS. Next, HR were placed three levels above and below the fractured level, and the test was repeated. Finally, the specimens were tested with 4.75 mm prebent LR segmentally wired using bilateral 18 gauge wire three levels above and below the fracture level. These three ¡techniques are standard surgical procedures. The devices were tested in the order described above (MWS, HR and LR) because preliminary studies indicated that failure of HR and LR induced comminuted lamina fractures which would not permit a proper placement of MWS for testing. Intact Torsos - Intact cadavers were seated on a platform mounted to the MTS actuator device and fixed at the pelvis with belts. Lateral thoracic plates were used to restrain the rotation of the specimen. The specimens were preflexed with the upper thoracic vertebrae 50 - 100 mm anterior to the pelvis with an angle of 15 degrees to the horizontal plane. Axial forces were applied through the MTS piston to the T2 - T3 region using a 150 X 150 mm square plate. Manikin Studies - Studies were conducted with a 50th percentile Hybrid II anthropometric manikin. The manikin was instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer in the region of the lumbar spine. The z-axis (principal direction) coincided with the superior-inferior direction, and x and y axes were along the lateral and antero-posterior directions, respectively. A Denton multi- axis force plate was used to record the axial and shear forces. The anthropomorphic manikin was dropped vertically from a height of 400 mm onto the force plate so that the buttocks of the Hybrid II contacted the surface. Three experiments were conducted. In the first two experiments, the manikin was positioned such that the buttocks of the manikin landed on the force plate vertically. In the third experiment, the dorsal aspect of the buttocks of the manikin contacted the force plate. These studies were conducted to simulate a direct vertical fall and a fall on the dorsal aspect.of the structure. TESTING PROCEDURE - Before the start of loading geometrical data such as intervertebral disc height were measured using vernier calipers and x-rays were taken in both micro-model and macro-model studies. The testing was performed at a constant displacement rate of 2.5 mm/s. Failure in all the specimens was defined as the point on the mechanical response at which an increasing deformation resulted in a decreasing force. This coincided in ligamentous column compression-flexion load experiments with a wedge fracture of the most stressed vertebral body and disruption of posterior elements. In flexure load experiments on the thoracolumbar column the above definition of failure coincided with the disruption of posterior elements followed by minimal wedging of the bone. Immediately after failure, roentgenograms were taken with the specimen still experiencing the external load to determine the Cobb angles. Failure in the instrumented spines (MWS, HR, LR) was defined as hook extrusion or bending of the specimen to the appropriate initial fracture angle as estimated from a transparent grid incorporating angular markings. The actual angles were determined radiographically. DATA COLLECTION - The loading head of the MTS device included a load washer (Kistler Model 9031) and a displacement transducer for load and deformation measurements, respectively. The applied load and deformations were recorded as a function of time on a digital oscilloscope (Norland Model 3001) capable of sampling at 1 ps, and a 18-channel visicorder (Honeywell Model 1858) with a frequency response of 2 kHz. The data were then transferred to a VAX 8600 computer for further analysis. Fracture angles in the ligamentous column (macro-model) experiments were calculated radiographically using the Cobb method. Maximal bending moments in the compression-flexion loadings were calculated as the product of the applied load and the maximum eccentricity; the latter was measured as the distance from the fractured vertebral body to a vertical line dropped from the most cephalad vertebral body. In functional unit experiments intervertebral disc bulges were also recorded as a function of time using preloaded potentiometers placed at the outer periphery of the disc at its mid height. In manikin experiments, data was collected using a modular data acquisition system (Trans Era M DAS model #7000) and a system of specially designed preamplifiers and filters. Class 1 000 filtering (SAE J21 1 6) at a sampling rate of 5 kHz was used. The sampled signals included the triaxial acceleration, and the vertical and shear force histories. 5.678</page><page sequence="4">881331 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MICRO-MODEL STUDIES Ligaments - Typical force-elongation curves for the six ligaments tested (ALL, PLL, JC, LF, ISL, SSL) are illustrated in Figure 2. In general, the patterns of the load-deflection response were similar for a particular type of ligament (for example, ALL) at all levels of the thoracolumbar column. However, the magnitudes of the biomechanical parameters were different. Therefore, the entire spinal column data was grouped into three regions: upper thoracic (T1 - T6), lower thoracic (T6 - T12), and lumbar (T1 2 -S1). Table 1 includes the biomechanical data based on this classification. The force-elongation curves for all the ligaments with the exception of JC were non-linear and had a single peak. JC exhibited two peaks one followed by the other after 2 - 8 mm of additional extension. The magnitude of the axial tension was almost the same for these two peaks emphasizing purely uni-axial nature of the insult and the combined structural behavior of the individual capsules bilaterally. From the force-deflection behavior, the maximum stiffness of the structure was also computed (Table 1). The mean maximum tensile forces for all the ligaments with the exception of PLL indicated an increase from cranial to caudal direction (T1 - S1). This agrees with published data [8,10]. ALL was the strongest ligament in resisting the tensile load and the ISL was the most flexible ligament (stiffness = 1 .3 N/mm). The less dense structure of the ISL may be the cause for the least magnitude of its stiffness. Tensile deformations at failure indicated that the ligaments were more distensible in the lumbar region. In addition, the ligaments furthest away from the geometric center of the column (ALL and SSL) demonstrated greater Figure 2 Representative force-deformation curves for thoracolumbar ligaments. 5.679</page><page sequence="5">TABLE 1 Biomechanical parameters of human thoracolumbar spinal ligaments.

PLL consistently had a lesser magnitude of failure elongation. Further, PLL, JC, and LF, the ligaments that are close to the geometric center indicated generally a higher trend in the stiffness than the ligaments which are further away (ALL, SSL, ISL). Vertebral Bodies - Figure 3 includes typical axial force- compression characteristics of lower thoracic (T11 - T12), and lumbar (L2 - L5) vertebral bodies. The mechanical response exhibited non-linear and sigmoidal characteristics, representative of any biological material [11]. From the initial geometrical measurements (specimen height was obtained as an average of the four heights measured in the anterior, posterior and bilateral locations, and the cross sectional area was computed using the dimensions in the exposed superior and inferior transverse surfaces of the vertebral body with the assumption that the structure geometry is an ellipse), stress and strain at failure was also computed. Table 2 includes a summary of the biomechanical parameters of the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies grouped into upper thoracic (T1 - T6), lower thoracic (T7 - T12) and lumbar (L1 - L5) levels. These results are in general agreement with the values reported in literature [12-14]. Failure compressive loads cited by Yamada are slightly higher [14]. The discrepancy may be due to the population and method of testing [14]. Intervertebral Discs - Axial compressive force-deflection responses of the inter-vertebral discs, which were tested by including the adjacent vertebral bodies in the cranial and caudal directions (functional units), were also non-linear and sigmoidal. Nine functional units in the lumbar region were studied. Five of these samples had degenerated discs while the remaining four were normal. The degeneration levels were determined based on the macroscopic appearance of the disc according to the criteria reported in literature [15]. Normal discs had higher load carrying capacity (failure load = 11.03 ± 1.4 kN), higher energy absorption (energy to ultimate failure = 18 ± 3.4 J), and higher stiffness (maximum stiffness = 2850 ± 293 N/mm), compared to degenerated specimens (load = 5.3 ± 0.29 kN, energy = 5.8 ± 1.6 J, and stiffness = 1642 ± 447 N/mm). However, the compressive deformations at failure were not significantly different for these two types of specimens (normal disc = 4.0 mm, degenerated disc = 3.6 mm) although the failure loads were considerably lower for degenerated specimens. Therefore, from this preliminary analysis it appears logical to hypothesize that the intervertebral joint is a deformation sensitive structure, i.e., failure occurs when the structure experiences a deformation threshold. Therefore, to prevent the structure from experiencing trauma, it may be appropriate to limit the insult so that the deformations do not exceed its critical threshold. MACRO-MODEL STUDIES Flexure Loading - In three-point loading tests, failure was concentrated at the center of the spine, the region of maximum flexural moment. In four-point bending tests, failure generally occurred in the region of the spine between the two loading points where the specimen experienced a pure flexure moment without any accompanying shear force. However, in one experiment failure occurred near the support which may be due to an improper restraint on the fixation system. An interesting observation from these flexure loading experiments was that instability resulted from the tear of the posterior elements associated with very minimal anterior compression of the vertebral bodies. This type of trauma is not often seen clinically. Table 3 includes a brief summary of the maximum load, displacement, and bending moments from the three and four point bending experiments. Compression-Flexion Loading - The principal advantage of flexure loading of the spinal column is that the initial failure can be controlled to occur in the thoracolumbar junction as most fractures of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are commonly seen between T10 and L2 [16]. However, these experiments preclude axial compressive forces on the thoracolumbar column which are primarily responsible for vertebral wedging. Therefore, it is necessary to use compression-flexion as the injury producing load vector to induce clinically relevant trauma to the spine. In these experiments, as expected, at the level of high moment the spinal column fractured resulting in wedging followed by the tear of the posterior ligaments depending on the level of axial load and degree of flexion moment. In two specimens, out-of-plane buckling was noticed. Table 4 summarizes the biomechanical data on these studies. Table 5 compares the data between the intact (non- instrumented) spine and spines instrumented with MWS, HR and LR. When the isolated and intact cadavers were considered together, failure loads were higher in the MWS trials than in the HR trials at a significance level of p&lt;0.10. The differences in failure load between the two was more significant in the intact spines (p&lt;0.01) than in the isolated ligamentous columns (p&lt;0.15). Failure loads for LR were not statistically different than those of initial injuries or MWS. However, the failure angles for the LR were lower than the initial injuries and MWS (p&lt;0.01). 5.680</page><page sequence="6">881331 Figure 3 Representative compressive force-deflection characteristics of thoracolumbar vertebral bodies.

However, they were higher compared to the HR instrumented spines (p&lt;0.01). In our institutional experience, MWS has a failure rate of approximately 6% including hook slippage and failure to maintain the correction of deformity. Failure rate for HR has been about 15%, primarily related to hook extrusion. A high degree of spinal stability is produced by segmental spinal stabilization devices like LR. However, the potential for spinal cord or nerve root injury caused by placement of wires into the narrow canal of the thoracic spine must be given proper consideration [17,18]. Failures of stabilization and broken wires may injure the spinal cord resulting in neurologic deficit. MWS was found to be biomechanically equal to or even superior to relatively more rigid devices such as HR for improving spinal stability. Other factors may also make the stiffened spring an optimal device for trauma induced by flexion-compression loading. Manikin Studies - Figure 4 illustrates the resultant force history at the impact site and shows the corresponding resultant acceleration at the lumbar spine of the manikin. The results of the three drop experiments conducted are included in Table 6. TABLE 6: Peak resultant force at the impact site and peak resultant acceleration at the lumbar region of the Hybrid II manikin for a 400 mm vertical drop.

However, in the third test, the y accelerations were larger in magnitude than the x and z components. This was due to the orientation of the manikin during impact. The vertical force (z axis) on the force plate was again an order of magnitude greater than the shear force (y axis). SUMMARY The hallmark of mechanical insult to the human body is the application of force on the tissue causing rupture, weakening, tear or fracture. With particular emphasis to motor vehicle induced trauma, it is essential to quantify the thresholds of tolerance and understand the mechanism of load transfer and injury to the human spine. This will facilitate better treatment of the injured patient and it may assist the safety engineer in an improved design of the vehicular environment. In this investigation, we have studied the response of the human thoracolumbar spine subjected to mechanical insults. Studies were conducted on isolated thoracolumbar components, ligamentous columns, and intact torsos. Among the six major ligaments, ALL was the strongest and PLL was the weakest structure. The most distensible ligaments were furthest away from the center of the spinal column. In general, all ligaments demonstrated an increase in strength from upper thoracic to lower lumbar levels. Similar behavior was observed in the physical and mechanical properties of vertebral bodies. Normal intervertebral discs tested using functional unit models indicated a higher load carrying capacity than degenerated specimens. However, the ultimate failure deformations did not exhibit this behavior. Although a study of these individual 12000-1 A 8000- ? ' &lt;D ' ° ' v. V i£ v.

Studies using isolated ligamentous columns and intact torsos suggested that only compression- flexion loading produced anterior wedging and posterior element disruptions. Conventional flexure loadings demonstrated posterior disruptions with minimal anterior wedging. It was found that, under compression-flexion loads, all three devices stabilized the spine although recovery was below the strength of the intact spinal column. However, other factors such as size of spinal canal and level of degeneration which are crucial to the protection of the spinal cord, must also be considered before any particular device is recommended for the injured patient. At relatively low drop heights, manikin experiments produced higher forces and accelerations than the thresholds suggestive of injuries reported in the literature (19,20). These studies on the uniaxial loading of thoracolumbar components, and compression- flexion and flexure loading of ligamentous columns and intact cadavers have provided base line biomechanical data and functional tissue changes under quasi-static force applications. Because traumatic injuries to the human spine in motor vehicle accidents are often associated with high rates of loading due to impact, it may also be necessary to investigate the effect of dynamic loads on the structural and pathological responses.
