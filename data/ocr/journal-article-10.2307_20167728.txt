<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some notes on sacrifice, shamanism, and the artifact FRANCESCO PELUZZI [. . .] oxen with white foreheads, pigs with turned-up snouts, and men with piles cannot be offered to the river. This is something all the shamans know [. . .] ?Chuang Tsu, "In the World of Men" (section 4) (trans. Burton Watson, New York, 1964, p. 62) I Sacrifice brings about an un-doing?but it is also very much the doing of an undoing: It takes on the natural process of dissolution as if to make of it its own ritual task.1 Sacrifice, that is, appropriates (and seeks to exorcise) fatality, turning necessity into choice, reaction into purpose. It is as if one chose to kill oneself because of the inescapable awareness that one cannot but die, or as if one nourished others, since one has to nourish oneself. Both killing and nourishing (others or oneself) imply creating waste, remains, leftovers that were not consumed: The engines of life are not homeostatic?they both require and reproduce dynamic unbalances. Sacrifice adopts these as its substance and raison d'?tre and puts them at the core of its doing-of-destruction: It regiments, but also ups the ante, so to speak, on the transcendental costs of living, and dying. The symbolic nature of sacrifice is revealed by its conjunction of opposites, such as conspicuous consumption and a hoarding of offerings?as though to re-state periodically that life must be fed just as it is extinguished, and that it is impermanent, just as it is being affirmed. Sacrifice, from its inception, must be seen less as the representation of a logical conundrum, than as the embodiment of the contradictions of a vital process at all times precariously balanced. Yet, in some way, the sacrificial expense is also meant to be offered as a total loss. While it may aim to obtain the favor of the gods, it does not do so in the form of a barter, but in the notoriously more problematic one of a gift: Not an altogether innocuous form of giving, sacrifice is at root an ambivalent gesture. The invisible powers that are the designated recipients of the sacrifice?whose reach is unfathomable, whose existence cannot be perceived, except as an epiphany? are incommensurable with the human will that is offering it. In its archaic setting, where the Dead are a prevalent vehicle of interaction with the divine (Totil Me'il, or "Fathers Mothers," the Highland Chiapas Tzotzil Maya still call them), sacrifice mediates a transaction toward Absence, the Void, and in that sense one might even say (as certain Vedic texts do) that sacrifice itself is the god.2 That is, by giving itself the Victim becomes the Godhead; or, reciprocally, the Divine is manifested in the offering, when the offering is accepted. It is made sacred by the rite of sacrifice?a specific sequence of gestures that separates the sacrifice from all other killing, and all other giving. But, couldn't the procedures of hunting?the actual gestures that make it efficient, such as stalking, the chase, and the deadly strike?provide a model for the actions that prepare the "victim" of sacrifice for the actual sequence of sacrificial gestures? If a mistake is made in the techniques of hunting, the prey takes off (or we may become its prey); just so, every mistake in the sacred techniques of ritual causes the Godhead (or the Ancestor) to take off?or, worse, ill disposes It. Therefore the hunt, a source of bloody nourishment, might be seen as the possible original paradigm of the ritual that nourishes the dead: The capturing and killing of alien beings ("wild" entities, i.e., independently endowed with life) may have provided a sort of counterweight for the gaping memory of those other "aliens" the dead become (so that in this perspective, ancestor = dead enemy-from-without). And so, animals in the wild? those mysterious and disquieting fleeting apparitions?as well as foreign humans, might both be seen, under special conditions, as manifestations of the dead. A sacrificial short-circuiting, then, would be established between those two worlds?that of the inhabited and that of the otherwise inhabited, that of the settled and that of the unsettled, that of the domestic and that of the "woods," that of the living and that of the dead. For that reason, though paradoxically, sacrifices generally 1. These scattered notes were written a few years back, in Italian, while staying on a Greek island, away from books: They are offered here in their original form, with no scholarly apparatus, after some revisions, partly prompted by the skeptical eye of a few friends: Especially that of Gini Alhadeff, to whom I am also grateful for translating them into English. 2.

In sacrifice, then, the offering goes from the home to the wilderness, whereas in hunting nourishment goes in the opposite direction. Dream-consciousness is one of the main links between the realm of the wild and the realm of the dead in non-literate societies. The memory of dream?that daytime external absence which shows up as an internal presence at night?may in fact have furnished Paleolithic hunter-gatherers their first experiences of another world, where the animal (the non-speaking) communicated with the human. That early European muralist painters (not too long, apparently, after resettling the Continent) chose extravagantly inaccessible dark caves for their representational exploits may have come from a wish?a marked one given the technical and circumstantial difficulties?to reproduce and objectify the inferiority of dreams and that of other conditions of altered, or heightened, perception so as to evoke those conditions in the waking state. The first hierophanies would therefore be not so much a representation of the blinding effect of direct Light (the Sun) as of the Shadows (and silhouettes) of reflected Light (the Moon)? that is, perhaps, symbolically, a first awareness of the projection of internal states. The vision of the dream is visited upon us; we are as if possessed by it. It is a condition that escapes the will, and as such brings about a mixture of fear and wonder, as in any encounter with the numinous.3 The transposition of this kind of experience into the making of objects and images is an affirmation of the ability (conscience) and will to remember and to share (a communally oriented, transitive mode)?and so, in some way, to repossess the ambivalence of the encounter with the divine, by setting it up, once more, as separate (or sacred). In this human world of scavenging, gathering, and hunting, living in awe of the unexpected?one might at any moment be killed and devoured?may have generated spontaneous epiphanies in relation to both the daytime encounters in the outer horizon of nourishment and the nocturnal ones in the inner world of dreams and ancestral apparitions. Such archaic outside/inside relations, transposed and projected dream encounters, may gradually have lost their primacy at the onset of the agricultural-pastoral revolution, when man, having become a partner of divinity in the creation of sustenance, came to face an ever more incumbent Creator. That Creator, in turn, would both have to make room for and confront man as holder of the new gift to set germination in motion. As a consequence, ever since we became food-producers, a new relationship between making-happen and spending (offering) may have informed our sense of transcendence, hence also the workings of sacrifice. Before that, the chief parameters of sustenance were two: to "find" and to "kill." Not all that one finds must be killed (as in the original domestication of wild seeds and animals), but certainly one cannot kill what one has not found. In anthropocentric terms this evidence can be reformulated as follows: "One cannot kill what does not somehow allow itself to be caught." Conversely, the game of pre-productive intentions, wills, attitudes, and abilities associated with the hunt once implied (and perhaps still does) a diffuse animalism that translated into forms of animism. Everything is animated?that is, everything has a soul or spiritual essence that makes it not merely alive but also intentionally active. That implies attributing a sort of awareness to the world as a whole somehow similar to that taking shape within oneself: It is a sense that expands onto things and bounces back from them to us in a perpetual circular movement. Today, we associate this participatory way of being with poetic and artistic activity, but it is generally connected to receptive perceptive aptitudes that are especially valuable in terms of hunting-gathering. Perhaps all predators, as well as their victims?and naturally one can be both things in turn?are in some way poets of the world, hunters especially attuned to inner and outer alterities (some of which may be singled out as an individual focus for identity). And it may be this original poiesis? a poetry of the interconnection between life and death?that permeates the way of apprehending the world that we call "shamanic" (a highly developed form of "animistic" interconnectedness). We know from ethnographic experience that the formation of the shaman depends on two key conditions: the manifestation of an acute vulnerability (the seeker as prey of uncontrollable forces) and the acquisition of a particular kind of (potentially deadly) 3. In her Sogni, illusion'! e altre realt? (Milan: 2004), p. 76 (Dreams, Illusion and other Realities [Chicago, 1984]), Wendy Donniger quotes an intriguing passage from the conclusion of S. Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams (in the Standard edition, trans. J. Strachey [London, 1953], vol. 5, p. 613), which may have some relevance to my considerations: "The unconscious is the true physical reality; in its innermost nature it is as much unknown to us as the reality of the external world, and it is as incompletely presented by the data of consciousness as is the external world by the communications of our sense organs." It is not possible to discuss this metapsychological dimension here.</page><page sequence="3">Pellizzi: Some notes on sacrifice, shamanism, and the artifact 241 power through forms of initiation. If the latter, in general, is a process by which awareness of a beginning (and hence also inevitably of an end) is transmitted and interiorized, we could see shamanic initiation as perhaps the first form of personal revelation. Through instances of discontinuity in consciousness that can be either spontaneous or expressly induced, the hunted hunter-of-souls finds, or encounters, not only adversaries but also one or more allies, who almost invariably belong to the outside animal world that populates his nightly dream journeys into the inside. He will acknowledge them as forever linked to him, on this oneiric plane of experience, which when reproduced in the waking state becomes a trance; but the transforming power of the work of initiation will enable him to transpose their efficacy into daytime practice. It is not sufficient to have met, one or more times, one's double: the shamanic theater?that original initiation performance drama?requires that the hunter and his double (be it "victim" or "killer") come to coexist (and forever battle) on every plane of experience. In turn, this gives the initiated the power to initiate others?that is, also to cause to live or die, to heal or to bewitch. Shamanic sacredness therefore is always transitive and in transit: It skips over boundaries and barriers (night/day, sleeping/waking, inhabited/uninhabited, house/forest, in-the-world/out-of-the-world, etc.); but also leads the shaman himself, together with his patient initiate, to explore both the depth and limits of these physical-existential polymorphous settings. Many are the ways of the shaman in the different registers of his interactive proceedings: It is a vast range of cognitive interactive modes, of a subtlety and complexity almost inconceivable for our reductive?and reduced? so-called rational and psychological consciousness. With regard to my main theme in these notes?which is the relation of sacrifice to various symbolic, productive, and reproductive modes?and from our postagricultural, and now quasi-postindustrial, perspective, the shamanic consciousness might at first appear to have been presacrificial. Yet, its immersion into a science of the displacements of beings (and of Being)?as manifested in what may be experienced in hunting and gathering, where sacrificial consciousness may have originated?speaks against such a hypothesis. It is more fruitful to try to imagine what a sacrificial (and sacred) modality might be in non-productive and non accumulative conditions. It is likely?and there are hints of this in the ethnographic literature?that the consciousness of killing, or of causing death (hence the awareness of death itself, of the concept of death, or of death as an object, and perhaps even that of the time and site-specific planning for the collection of natural and spontaneously growing plant foods) came with the need for some form of sacral-sacrificial act of "compensation." Again, killing and collecting are both a subtraction and an addition: There is a disembodying from an autonomous, alternate existence in order to add on to one's (individual or collective) being. This may mean that implicit in the awareness of inflicting death may be a delimitation of the bodily status of entities perceived and acknowledged as distinct: A sort of sacralization of all life forms. Thus animism might be said to be protomaterialist in that the participatory modality of the hunter-gatherer also implies the sense of a heightened corporality. It is the intense physicality of all beings that is striking (at times, quite literally) in shamanic relations, even (and especially), once again, when the latter refer to dream encounters: the "perils of the soul" can be far more substantial in that world of imaginary experiences than in our positive one. In fact, in this universe of body-soul interspecies relations, you could say that all participants are shamans of sorts, as they share a certain transhuman knowledge. What distinguishes the shaman is a greater disposition to absorb and articulate parallel perceptions?those that cross over the boundaries of the realm of human language into that of wild (or mythological) thought. Whatever the case may be, it is important to remember that the experiential-cognitive modalities of the shamanic ethos?that human/ transhuman morality?must not be reduced to a psychological key. The "logic" of mental forces at play here goes beyond the limits of psychic self-conscience? or, rather, ignores them?in favor of absolutely contingent confrontations in which powers outside the psyche play at every instance a determining role. In no sense of the word is the shaman an idealist: Everything for him can be the sign of hidden causes? just as to the hunter every movement of grass, every scent, every change of light or color, every shadow, can speak of presences and absences, of life and death?but nothing appears to him as internal conditioning. "Demonic" possession comes from the outside, just as trance is an ecstatic journey.4 In the first instance, it is 4. Despite its appearance of magical subjectivity, "shamanic thought" could well be said to be akin to what Michel Foucault called, in tribute to Maurice Blanchot, the "thought of [the] outside." See M. Foucault, La pens?e du dehors (Paris: 1986 [1966]).</page><page sequence="4">242 RES 51 SPRING 2007 the wild that enters the shaman-hunter; in the second, it is he himsejf who, either unmoving or, on occasion, dancing on the spot, explores other worlds?other ways of being and, again, of Being itself. That would seem to imply a form of consciousness?or bodily awareness as identity?that is not merely permeable, but whose very limits must in some way be elastic: I am myself but I am also the other. The bear is a bear but it is also me; so in killing me, he kills himself?just as I, if I were to kill him, would also be killing myself. And that, perhaps, may be the original shamanic form of sacrifice, that which established it as the awareness of a double homicide. Possession and ek-stasis may be the two experiential vehicles that explore, as well as constitute, this primal sacrificial landscape. Such a configuration of conscience, which may have prevailed for many tens of thousands of years?at least since the dawning of homo sapiens, if not earlier?may have survived beneath new forms of relations to the non-human that were introduced, once more, with the domestication of plants and animals: The Neolithic societies?and even, to some extent, those of the ages of metal?are to this day also hunting and gathering ones in some parts of the world. So, for example, even aspects of initiation and sacrificial cults often associated with the development of complex agricultural theologies?such as the Maize God or the White Goddess?can be seen, at least in part, as a neo anthropomorphic transposition of pre-agricultural animistic-shamanic conceptions. The perspective offered here could lead us to see the great flowering of blood sacrifice?and that of offering-destruction consumption?in some agricultural civilizations as something more than the result of demographic concentration and new "modes of production," because, in the end, what need would there be to kill humans in order to ensure a bountiful harvest and the reproduction of domestic animals? But if the reliance on crops and domestic animals has taken the place of previous survival conditions dependent?every day and night? on existential encounters in which the life-death confrontation was unmediated and crucial (with its shamanic dimension?that is, death, and the conscience-of-death, as a warranty of life), then the agricultural-pastoral sacrifice (and auto-sacrifice, as in blood-letting) could be seen, by analogy, as a new, though still quasi-shamanic investment in the transcendent dimension of the productive processes, in as much as this has given rise to a more objectifying (manipulative and controlling) relation with all the generative energies of the world?a quasi-God-like one, which must be atoned for.5 But even where the agricultural-mercantile revolution eventually allowed for the establishing of proto-urban societies, a complete transformation in all the ways of conceiving of the experience of the outside is unthinkable: Different modes had to coexist through the ages (as, for instance, in many new forms of witchcraft practices and beliefs), sometimes in opposition with and even conflict among themselves, just as today our so-called global 5. It is in Genesis, perhaps, that sacrifice is first both cleansed of but also reinvested with its blood substance: Just as God prefers Abel's agricultural offerings and Cain kills Abel. It remains a complex and controversial question whether and in what sense the self-spilled blood of God's Son (also significantly called the Son of Man), might also constitute a final redemption of that of Abel, so that our "sacrifices" would have become bloodless. Be that as it may, the (suspended) killing of Isaac is the paradigm of sacrifice in Abrahamic traditions: The humanization of the animal victim, which becomes its constitutive feature. Even on the Greek side of our heritage, Iphigenia (according to some sources) was at the last instant replaced by a beast. But what is the nature of the link between the sacrifice-non-sacrifice of Isaac (that establishes the paradigm for ritual-symbolic substitution, and makes of the Son of Abraham the first miraculous survivor) and his father's covenant with Jehovah? The infinite cannot be diminished by anything, because nothing can either be added to or subtracted from it. And yet, the very notion of a covenant would seem to imply a reciprocal limitation, as in the definition of separate (sacred) confines of action. From the moment when the Godhead comes to terms with the people, It is no longer boundless: The limit of Jehovah is the pact with Man, and this very pact is also what binds man, his religio. It is this very confine that establishes the sacred sacrificial enclosure of the temple (t?menos), so that, in that perspective, one might even go so far as to see the entire Biblical history of Creation, the Fall, the Promise, and Redemption, as a gradual sacrificial reduction of the divine within the (ritual) confines of the sacred. The progressive secularizing of the sacred that then ensued (as in Christianity)?in part through a shift toward the growing immanence of the "holy" (as quite distinct from the "sacred"?recently, Mother Theresa was called a "living saint" by media commentators at her funeral, and at that of Pope John Raul II, large signs held up by delegations of "mourners" read "Santo Subito")?would be the end result of an objectifying (and sacrificial) process that started at least with the origins of our written tradition, if not before, and perhaps of all historical religions.

II Our time, which began with the European invasion of the Americas, crystallized into its modern form in conjunction with our expansion into Africa, Asia, and the Racific: Thus it is also the first and only era that has had to witness the coexistence, and sometimes clash, between shamanic, agricultural-pastoral, and industrial and postindustrial types of sacrificial conscience on a global scale. These have now become "communicating" chambers, making the definition of their original content, as well as the terms we use to evoke them, quite confusing. Many questions remain. Historically, for instance, an important one for the definition of Amerindian horizons is that of the exact relationship between the Asiatic-shamanic roots of the hunter gatherers who waded through the Bering Straits, populating the New World from the East, and the proto urban agricultural developments of Mesoamerican, Andean, and Amazonian civilizations. An equally crucial one, from an American anthropological and historical perspective, concerns the exact characterization of those forms of ecstatic possession associated with the circum-Atlantic rim and its forced and spontaneous migrations: In what sense can one say, or not say, that the pan-African ethos is also in some way shamanic? To what degree do the localized and elaborate ancestor cults of lineages and dynasties, tied to advanced pastoral-agricultural modes of production, combine with and transform the still strong, lingering relationship with the "spirits of the wild"? Despite some valid attempts, the complexities of African-Amerindian interaction have not truly been unraveled. And what to make, in this respect, of the great circum-Pacific cults (with all the profound differences among them) and, especially, those of Australia? The latter obviously represent an extreme case: largely isolated for tens of thousands of years, Australia was a world apart. It developed in relative autonomy, like the natural environment of the Galapagos, so that the Australians' experience/self-awareness in relation to the land took on quite an original configuration: In this one can find an emphasis on the site-specific roots of mythological ancestral places?their sacredness set at key points in the landscape, which become the focus of mythological narratives; and yet, these sites are also invested by numinous contingencies, implying a quasi-shamanic relationship (both individual and communal) with animals and other presences of the wild. Here, the totem, which cannot be killed or consumed, is a sort of anti-sacrifice?the object of a nonsubstitutive renunciation. One could perhaps consider grounding a comparative anthropology of the artifact by starting from portable objects, such as those mysterious Australian ones (e.g., the churinga) associated with specific sites. The nature of their uselessness as tools, the fact that they do not appear to have a practical function, must be examined: What is their relation to the reflective form of consciousness which, long before language, engendered the utensil, vastly increased the human power to kill and made of Man an omnivorous predator, but may also have contributed essentially to the hunter-killer's loss of the presacrificial bliss of the Golden Age? The object tool (the weapon)?the first we know of long predated ornaments and representations?could then be seen as in itself a pr?figuration of the sacrificial relationship: Namely, not only an instrument of death, but also in fact, the first object that is associated with, and hence embodies in its very conception and factura an awareness of a new disequilibrium between man and cosmos, which, as I have tried to indicate, may be at the root of the intrinsic ambivalence of the sacrificial nexus. From this perspective, the useless (or ritual and sacred) utensil might be aimed at rebalancing the rift in the original, homeostatic order brought about by the weapon (sacrificial, as they all are, in principle), while also sanctioning the transcendental imbalances and inequalities founding the new world order. It may be this anti-value (or non-material function), then, that invests the sacred artifact, sacrificial knife or mask, with its quasi-contradictory role in both the ritual staging and resolution of the deadly threats of cosmic and social anomie?at once a memento of our exit from Eden and an instrument of possible return. So, to recapitulate in somewhat more concrete terms: An object such as the churinga is not a utensil, and yet, in some way, it, too, is a weapon. The magical-ritual, or sacrificial, weapon contains and combines the magic of a double identification with both he who sacrifices and the sacrificed (as with the hunter and his victim, the shaman and his/her patient-initiate, etc.). In this symbolic medium, the knowledge of a relation at once immediate and elusive is transposed and reified: that of the clash/encounter which startles, reveals, and, potentially at least, kills. The instrument-artifact embodies the fluidity and indeterminacy of the shamanic-hunting encounter (with its potential for epiphany) within the sacred confines of its factura. It is</page><page sequence="6">244 RES 51 SPRING 2007 this symbolic containment that preserves the powers deriving from the ritual object's "wild" origins: In order to act on divine (or natural) creation, the tool-not-tool, artifact of human creation, must have recourse to the dark, unseen forces that are like the intimation of an uncreated (or transhuman) origin. This, too, is an expression of the sacred tool's symbolic nature, of its being and not being what it seems to be?and so also of its general character of a mask. Because this instrument always hides something?manifesting its function but not its origin (or vice versa)?it thereby cultivates the mystery of its idenfity: As a potential instrument of death, it must defend life, but as a gift of the dead, it becomes a weapon of the living, that is, of the not-yet dead, the still flesh-and-blood presences that have yet to become ancestors.6 That nourishment implies a dissolution of living form can't have escaped the first self-reflective and symbolic consciousness: It is a double undoing?in the absorption of nourishment and in its evacuation. Similarly, the making of the artifact always implies as much the doing as the undoing of a "natural" form (or at least its transformation).7 And what is the form that must be undone in order to be preserved? Impermanence and permanence are its key terms: the first in the dynamic of its development and of its wilting, the second in that of its recognizable identity (shape) and generative potential. So, here we have both form as expression of time?form as duration?but, also, form as a distinct place?and that place is a configuration that contains. Every form includes something (hence excludes something else): The form (and potential) of the weapon instrument as much as that of the basket for seed gathering or the vase for cooking. That content, in a general sense, is what we might call (with the 7ao Te Ching, ch. 11) the meaning (or usefulness) of form; and in turn, the assigning of meaning to form is in fact what evokes its intrinsic content. It could be the (reflexive) awareness of forms that leads to the assigning of contents such as those referred to as "animistic." So, for example, a rock having a certain form is also endowed with a particular spirit, or soul, which is contained, specifically, within that form. Such spiritual essence, in many animistic cultures, is linked to the memory of an ancestral presence?and that, in turn, has its own narrative history, evolving in a fluid mythological register that collapses the when into the where, and expands the latter into spiraling images of the former. As already recalled, the world of the hunter-shaman is that of a universe of forms that are also all spirits: Nothing, really, is inert because it is the form of every single thing?with its internal/external dynamis?that the shaman must, again and again, face, as does the hunter. This then, once more, is a sort of hyperecstatic universe. Anyone can have an intuitive awareness of the way that cultures still marked by their premodern traditions?that is, as not yet completely affected by the Enlightenment revolution (like popular Mexican culture, for instance)? may manifest an ecstatic-totalizing preoccupation that informs all they do, the things they surround themselves with, the places in which they live, work, etc. It is an almost obsessive and yet quite natural and spontaneous attention given to form even in the most common settings, determining the looks of most artifacts (including the prefabricated and readymade, the industrial, the plastic ones, etc.), and their assemblages in devotional and commercial, as well as domestic and circumstantial settings. It may be necessary to revisit and qualify the generally held tenet that an ever-growing fixation on formal qualities has accompanied the modern world's progressive secularization. If the category of the aesthetic has acquired, for us, greater and greater autonomy, becoming one of our dominant referential modes, this has also been at the price of a decrease in the effectiveness and power of form. It might be promising, at least from the perspective I am adopting here, to see that of the "archaic world" as an alternate mode of apprehension in which every form is charged with intrinsic significance, whose quality and parameters can vary greatly, but whose constant and dominant character is that of being over-determined: It is this aesthetic over-determination?this investment into a power intrinsic to form?which has at times been termed "magical." Magic is also a sort of formal hyper determination, operating on the basis of an analogous valorization of the effects of form. Yet, between the ability of the pre-human primate to distinguish the qualities of its environment in order to survive and the "aesthetic" perception of man-the-maker of weapons utensils?even before he acquired the use of fully articulate language?there is a great leap: We might see 6. A Mazatec psylocibin mushroom "priestess," on the Mountains of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, referred to us participants in one of her ceremonies as "Santo y Santa": Though still living, we were, at that ritual time, raised to the status of "ancestors." 7. It has been noted that "excremental art" has now become an accepted category of the (ever) ongoing neo-avant-garde: From the "artist shit" cans of the Italian Piero Manzoni (in the 1950s) to the recent cow-dung paintings of the African-British Chris Ofili, and many others.</page><page sequence="7">Pellizzi: Some notes on sacrifice, shamanism, and the artifact 245 it as that which brought about the awareness of both deferred action and action-at-a-distance: that is, a new space-time awareness, which in turn led to both the recognition of the separate-as-sacred and the conception of the possibility of a magical power of and on beings and things?and, in fact, of seeing all things as beings. Magic, then, can also be considered a function of the original introduction of time into the spatial awareness of doing. And it is this same awareness that constitutes the very fabric of ritual?that is, the structuring of repetitive action as a spatial-temporal sequence of behavioral units?recalling but moving well beyond its natural and non-human origins in the procedures of instinctual behavior, though at times deliberately mimicking them.8 Now if this (spatial-temporal) object-ritual?an "artifact" whose magic is form in action?often mimics those animal-ancestral forms so clearly attested to in all mythology, we could say that in the archaic world the dead tend to return as animals because it was in fact like animals that they had relinquished, in dying, their humanity (their symbolic space-time awareness). This might well be their "sacrifice"?the shedding of human nature in favor of a divine, or sacred one?which the ritual form re-evokes in its configuration of sacred (separate) spaces and times: This rescues the dead from the deforming effect of death (formless time and space) by objectifying animal associations and a progressive distancing from human identity. Whether it be by a mask, an impersonation (dance), or an object-icon, what is neutralized through the lightness (sursum corda!) of the object-ritual is the entropie corrosion-dissolution operated by time at (and on) a certain site; and what is staged is the dissimulation of the "mortal" character of the deadweight that is the burden of any given time. The object-ritual, and its performance, are sacrificial because they embody symbolically the unsolvahle tension between two necessities: that of the un-doing and that of the preservation of life.9 Life is conferred on the not living object only so that it might, sacrificially, be taken away again, just as on the living body?human or animal?death is inevitably meted out by gods?or ancestors, sometimes in animal form, or by other men, sometimes in spirit-form. The (shamanistie) transposition of the sacrificial model on the subtle or "animistic" plane does not change its fundamental terms, but allows for the deferral of violence. The theater of the struggle between souls is a political one, but formalized and objectified as an internal one (these are always internecine conflicts, often involving relatives, while outsiders are for the most part killed by weapons, like wild animals): It is well known that, in archaic settings, outsiders are not even considered "people." The sense that there is an "among ourselves" that is as mortal?and potentially deadly?as the ancient struggle to survive in the animal world (that is, among those beings who speak another tongue) corresponds with the proliferation of communities that are distinct, in competition, and constitute a constant threat to each other. This form of sacrificial imagery is particularly apparent in situations where a condition of cultural proximity and fusion might be accompanied by strong internal and external discrimination and an emphasis on social hierarchy: Here the struggle can become an internalized image ofthat outside resistance that the group must constantly negotiate. The representation and playing-out of these conflicts nearly always happens through the use of artifacts. It is as though the perception of the sacrificial knot?the ultimate awareness of a price for living, as provided for instance in serendipitous or iterative dream encounters (which, as in psychoanalysis, tend to acquire the character of hermeneutic systems)?demanded physical correlates (preferably artifacts) in order to express itself and at the same time go beyond (or sublimate) itself? that is, suffering and sustaining the weight of the continuous shifts from a time to kill to a time to die?0 What we might call the "sacrificial nexus" (or "knot") can perhaps also be detected in the relationship 8. Kronos, vanquished and expelled from Zeus's new kingdom (our world), ended up ruling over the equally dispossessed Titans, on an Island of the Blessed. So, we might conclude that the two sorts of time to be considered?the chthonic one of the Golden Age, and the ritual (and solar) one of ours?are in some way parallel, rather than subsequent. See Rudolf Otto, Cli Dei del la Grecia (Milan: 2004 [1929]), p. 139. 9. I have evoked some aspects of these questions, particularly in regard to the possible relation of corpse-artifact, in a lecture delivered at a conference in Moscow (june 2004), "Anthropological aspects of hierotopy: Archaic and modern sites of the numinous," soon to be published. 10. The contemporary Maya (or Zoque) "talking saint"?a secret object enclosed in a box?is the epitome of this symbolic objectuality, which corresponds with the subtle perception-awareness of the sacrificial knot. Whether it is called "San Miguelito," or is revealed, in muted voice, to be "just three stones," the fact is that these objects "speak" and they always speak of potentially mortal conflicts (again in both senses). As if in a less self-conscious version of the Heraclitean polemos, this a struggle lived?every day and night?inside and all round: Once more, an animic-oneiric form of perception revealing, and objectifying, what may be hidden within and, especially, without?or that without that is hidden within.</page><page sequence="8">246 RES 51 SPRING 2007 between the tools of the shaman (as hunter of souls) and the objects he extracts from the body of his patient initiate. Neither are mere visualizations of invisible powers and conditions: One is the tool?like an obsidian sacrificial knife?which makes it possible to penetrate through the body taken as form and container (the weapon that breaks its barriers), and expels that other instrument?the intruder?which another conscious intentional ity has inserted, or projected, into the form-identity of the patient-initiate, undermining its integrity (in a sort of un-sacrifice). The object weapon/extraneous object, then, operates on a double register: that of devastating intruder and that of healing thing (what restores the borders of the identical-to-itself). This wound-that-heals, which also becomes the offering that-reveals, is another manifestation of what I call the sacrificial knot. In the so-called "religions of the Book," this has taken on sublimated (often sublime) forms that sometimes are associated with practices leading to mystical revelation. But the original sacrificial nucleus, which is both that of a killing (even, in some cases, of the self) and of a reabsorption (at times of the deceased ancestor through the animal that is killed, eaten, and even occasionally represented) remains fundamentally unchanged. It is remarkable, once more, that for the most part the hunted?or captured?wild animal is not offered in sacrifice: Because only a human possession may be offered in place of a human being, but also?if the perspective presented here is tenable?because its very capture-killing is in and of itself already a sacrifice of sorts, but on the part of the Divine (or alternatively, as in Maurice Blanchot, of its "part maudite"). Neolithic proto-religions may have introduced into the primary sacrificial relation the notion of the-price-of life?and hence also the possibility of slavery. That price?which eventuallybecame life's value?was turned into an object, then a possession (a ritual one, first and foremost), which gradually acquired autonomy, and eventually came to be separated from the remains of the dead (the word itself indicates that process of shedding, distancing). It left the tomb to posit itself as a cultural tool?and as such in turn worthy of a new sort of worship, as a representation, that is as a double in a cultural-instrumental exchange. But this final leap into the reproduction of form, which is generally associated with the origin of, then the prevalence, and finally the rejection of the aesthetic, is in reality a weakening of that original aisthesis?which I have termed sacrificial? in which every formal element corresponds not to a separate but to a formally specific identity (and communion). It is not a question here of contrasting religious contents with new representational interests? even though that may have some bearing in the transition from the late agricultural and shepherding cultures to those governed by trade and later by industry. But if form is, literally, essential to the sacrificial root of the object, in the sense that it determines, with the precision of ritual, the relations between all beings and the balance between the realms of life and death, specific religious contents may actually be secondary with respect to this primary aesthetic, and might even be considered as inaugurating a separation between essence (or the sacrificial event) and form. One question, among many, that could still be invoked concerns the apparent resurfacing of formal, often antirepresentational and content-shy aesthetic symbolic expressions in late- and postindustrial modernism. Do they echo, in a neo-Primitivist key (and in a climate warming up to neo-barbarism) that original sacredness, which derived from the proto-sacrifice of the hunt, or do they constitute its perhaps ultimate obliteration? This might be a valid theme for a future meditation on the Future. (Paxos, July 2004)</page></plain_text>
