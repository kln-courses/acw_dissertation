<plain_text><page sequence="1">AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO ARISTOTLE'S CLASSIFICATION OF METAPHOR Al-Jurjini, who died in 471 A.H., has always been considered, in both classical and modern Arabic works on rhetoric and literary criticism, as one of the most prominent critics in Arabic. His books Asrdr al-Baldgha and Dald'il al-IYdt have been given great attention, especially in the last twenty years. However, no full treatment of his work on poetic imagery has been produced. The present paper is an attempt to analyse some aspects of al-Jurjmni's work on isti'dra only and, more specifically, his classification of isti'dra. However, it is obvious that in such a short article it is difficult to consider all aspects of this classification. The purpose of the present study is to show the basic features of this classification and its importance for his theory of poetic imagery, on the one hand, and its relevance to his comprehensive concept of both the nature and the function of literary expression on the other. It is also planned to show that this classification is of great interest not only in its historical context, but also in its striking similarity to some twentieth century classifications worked out by modern European critics, and its avoidance of some features of these classifications which have been considered as defects.' The comparison between al-Jurj ani's classification and the modern European ones is helpful in judging the relation between al-Jurjani's classification and that of Aristotle, whose influence on al-Juridni's thinking is said by some writers to be overwhelming.2 The line of argument followed in this respect is that Aristotle's classification is held by modern critics to be of a completely different nature from the modern German classification by dominant trait. If it could be demons- trated that the latter classification is based on the same principles as al-Jurj mni's one, it would then be natural to suggest that al- Jurjini's classification is of a different nature from Aristotle's. 1 See Christine Brooke-Rose, "A Grammar of Metaphor", Mercury Books, (London 1965), Introduction. 2 See Taha Husain, Introduction to Nakd al-Nathr (Cairo 1933). Hlusain says that al-Jurjani was "a philosopher commenting on Aristotle."</page><page sequence="2">AL-JURJANL'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'ARA 49 Aristotle's Classification of Metaphor Aristotle does not write at length on the classification of metaphor. All he says on this point is: "Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else; the transference being either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy".' There is a general agreement among European critics that this passage represents all that Aristotle says on the classification of metaphor. In fact, Aristotle himself has referred in his Rhetoric to the existence in his Poetics of what he clearly called "classification of metaphors".2 However, in spite of that, Christine Brooke-Rose, who first considered the passage quoted as representing Aristotle's classification,3 proceeded to say: "Aristotle abandons his own classification by mental process as soon as he is faced with actual examples, and accepts metaphor as an entity in active relationship to the thing described. In doing so he hints at the classification of his successors (Typhon, Gregorius Corin- thus, Cocondrius), which was to be that of the Latin and medieval rhetoricians, namely the animate-inanimate classification".4 Miss Brooke-Rose does not exemplify Aristotle's hint at this new clas- sification, but it is likely that the passage which she has quoted from Aristotle before arriving at her conclusion is responsible for the opinion she expresses. This passage reads: "All smart sayings are derived from proportional metaphor and expressions which set things before the eyes ... that is, by words that signify actuality ... In all these there is appearance of actuality, since the objects are represented as animate... Homer has attached these attributes (shameless, eager) by the employment of proportional meta- phor; for as the stone is to Sisyphus, so is the shameless one to the one who is shamelessly treated".5 Is it justifiable to consider the quoted passage as a hint at another classification? As far as the present writer is concerned the answer is negative. In the first place, it is not true that Aristotle "abandons his own classification by mental process as soon as he is faced with actual examples." In many other places in his book he quotes as examples 1 Poetics ch. 21, 145b I, (Bywater's translation). 2 Rhetoric Book III, 2, 1405a (Rhys Roberts' translation). The reference seems to be to the passage quoted above, because this is the only place in Poetics in which Aristotle discusses the various relations involved in the process of transference. 3 Op. cit. p. 3. 4 Ibid. p. 5. 6 Rhetoric Book III, 11.2, as referred to in Brooke-Rose. In W. Rhys Roberts' translation, which is slightly different, the passage is in Book IIl, 2, 1412a. Journal of Arabic Literature, II 4</page><page sequence="3">50 AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'CARA of metaphor instances which are based on the genus-species, species- genus and species-species relationships.1 On the other hand, Aristotle's words make it clear that the process of representing objects as animate is achieved by Homer by the employment of proportional mietaphor. Now proportional metaphor is the fourth type of his classification quoted above. This excludes the possibility of taking his analysis of the process of animating objects as a hint at a new classification. In the present study, the discussion of Aristotle's classification of metaphor will be based entirely on his well known passage in the Poetics quoted earlier. No other part of his treatment of metaphor will be considered as forming any further development of this classification. This is not to say that no other part of his study is relevant to his classification of metaphor, but this is something entirely different. Aristotle's classification enumerates four possible relations in the process of transference. It is of initerest that in this classification complete identity is established between metaphor and transference. Transference produces metaphor only. Metaphor can be produced only by transference.2 The four relations involved in creating a meta- phor are of an obvious logical nature. They are based on the general- particular relationship, as in the first three types, and the relationship of alnalogy, as in the fourth type. It is also of interest that the relation between metaphor, or transference, and the similarity relationship is not discussed at all. Nevertheless, Aristotle does not seem to be coherent when he says that simile is the same thing as metaphor, but is put differently.3 For this statement means either that simile is based on transference, or that metaphor is based on similarity. The first case is obviously invalid, the second contradicts the relationship general-particular on which Aristotle's first three divisions are based. Two Concepts of the Classification It has been pointed out earlier that Aristotle establishes a complete identity between transference and metaphor. His reference in the 1 See for instance Poetics ch. 21, 1450a, where he studies the metaphor in thc word "all", saying that "all" is metaphorically put for "many", since "all" is thc species of "many". Other examples in the Rhetoric itself, Book III, 2, 1411b. 2 T his feature of Aristotle's concept of metaphor constitutes one of the most basic differences from al-Jurjani's concept of isticdra, as will be seen later. 3 This will be compared with al-Jurjani's view later on. 'Fhe incoherence in Aristotle's view is carried further by his analysis of the merits of metaphor on which he comments as follows: ". . .and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars". (Poetics ch.21, 1459a).</page><page sequence="4">AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 51 Rhetoric to a "classification of metaphors" which he produces in his Poetics, could thus be interpreted as a "classification of transferences". The failure to acknowledge this aspect of his study led Miss Brooke- Rose to a confusion in the comparison between his classification and the classification by domain of thought, and especially, the classifica- tion by dominant trait. Aristotle's classification concentrates mainly on the external relation between the two terms in the process of transfe- rence, i.e. whether they are both general or one is general and the other is particular, or, as in the fourth type, whether they are analogous. The classification by dominant trait concentrates on the internal relation between the two terms. Thus, the basic question which Aristotle's classification answers is: What is the nature of the two terms involved in the process of transference? The classification by dominant trait is based on an already defined concept of the nature of the relation bet- ween the two terms, this relation being similarity. The question which is answered here is: What is the point of similarity between the two terms involved? Metaphors are then classified according to the nature of the point of siniilarity, or dominant trait. In other words, the Aristotelian classification does not assume a trait, or substance existing in both terms, but tries to define the logical categories to which each term belongs, and the relation between these categories (of the terms) rather than the relation between the terms themselves. The classification by dominant trait takes as its basis the existence of the same trait in both terms and proceeds to analyse this trait itself. This conclusion is responsible for the external-internal antithesis expressed above, as being the basic difference between these two types of classifications. The external-internal antithesis is based on a fundamental difference between Aristotle's concept of metaphor and the concept of this figure adopted in the classification by dominant trait. In the former, the relations involved in metaphor are of two types: the species- genus-species relationship and the relationship of analogy.' Analogy is by its own nature based on a certain type of similarity. Whereas in the latter classification, the only relation which is said to be involved is similarity.2 1 This seems to be a more appropriate way of expressing the four types of Aristotle's metaphor than calling them "The species-genus classification" as Brooke-Rose has done. Op. cit. pp. 3-5. 2 Except in Stern's work as it will be seen.</page><page sequence="5">52 AL-JURJANI' S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI',ARA Bearing in mind those differences between the Aristotelian classifica- tion of metaphor, and the classification by dominant trait, it will be possible to say that Aristotle's classification is a classification not of a group of metaphors based on the same principle, but of different types of transferences which have different natures. In other words, and taking into account al-Jurjdni's analysis of the process of transfer- ence and the terminology he uses in this analysis, Aristotle's classifica- tion is one of al-majda and not of al-isti(dra. This distinction is essential for the understanding of al-J urj ani's classification of isti(dra and its relation to Aristotle's classification of metaphor. And in this sense, it is evident that Aristotle has not pro- duced a classification of isti'dra, He has only named one type of it, namely, the proportional one, as being one type of transference. Hence, it is possible to suggest that the Arab translators of Aristotle were confused when they translated Aristotle's metaphor by isti(ara. Aristotle's metaphor should have been translated as a type of rNajaZ, including the species-genus-species relationship and that of analogy.1 It will be shown that this forms only one part of al-Jurij ni's tnajaz, which includes more types of transference based on the contiguity relation than the species-genus-species one, and another type of isti'dra besides the proportional one. The Rela/ions Involved in Transference The emphasis on the similarity relation as a differentia of the classifica- tion by dominant trait was a basic feature of such works as Hermann Paul's 'PrinZipien der Sprachgeschichke', which was first published in 1886.2 Paul's analysis of the precise nature of the similitude between the two terms included in the metaphor is discussed by Christine Brooke-Rose as representing the classification by dominant trait. The other analysis is the one produced by Miss Hedwig Konrad.3 The former work, in addition to G. Stern's4 'Meaning and Change of I This statement is based on the view held by the present writer, and contrary to the views of many critics including Kratchkovsky, that isti'dra in Arabic traditionl had almost always been thought of as being based on similarity before al-Jurjiani's time. 2 flermann Paul, "Prin!Zipien der Sprachgeschichte", seventh edition, Miax Nic- meyer Verlage (Tubingen, 1966). 1 would like to acknowledge the help givenl to me by Mtiss Ruth Stollery who kindly translated the chapters on metaphor.

Ullmann's 'The Principles of Semantics'" will form the basis of the attempt made in the present study to establish the thesis that al-Jurj ani's classification of isti'dra is based on the dominant trait, or resembling attributes, and corresponds in its basic structure to one of the latest well-formed classifications of metaphor produced in modern European studies, namely Ullmann's "Functional classification of Semantic Change". The classification by dominant trait is based on the principle that the relation involved in metaphor is the similarity relation. The similarity is established between one or more attributes of the terms involved in a metaphor. Naturally, a similarity between all the attributes of the two objects makes it impossible to create a metaphor, for the objects will be identical. Miss Konrad's work on the nature of the similitude in metaphor, as discussed in Miss Brooke-Rose's book, seems to be a better re- presentative of the classification by dominant trait than Paul's. For, although Paul makes a clear distinction between similarity relation and other relations involved in the transference, and emphasises similarity as being a characteristic of metaphor only,2 his classification can hardly be called a classification by dominant trait. Miss Brooke- Rose gives the impression that Paul's classification is "according to the common attributes of the proper term and the transposed term (such as form, dimension, function)." 3 However, this view is mis- leading. It is obvious that Paul has not "sketched out a classification according to the common attribute" as she says. Indeed, Paul has enumerated the relations, or points of similarity, which she mentions, such as "form, dimension and function".4 But he has not called this part of his analysis a classification. This analysis has dealt with such types of metaphor as those based on the concrete-abstract, 'abstract- concrete, and animate-inanimate relationships.5 Of course, it is possible for a critic to establish a classification of metaphor by dominant trait, in which the above mentioned relations are included, but in this case, his aim will be to analyse the nature of the point of similarity involved in these types of metaphor, and not 1 Stephen Ullmann, "The Principles of Semantics", 3rd impression.

The former approach certainly forms a classification by dominant trait, as al-Jurjani's approach will be shown to have done, whereas the latter will form classifications of domain of thought and animate inanimate types. It is this method of approach which was adopted by Paul. Therefore, his classification cannot be considered a classifica- tion by dominant trait. It is surprising to notice that the writer who is probably the most representative of the classification by dominant trait amongst the European writers dealt with in the present paper was not even men- tioned in Miss Brooke-Rose's study of this type of classification.' Stern has produced a full classification of metaphor by dominant trait, which could be taken as a useful basis to understand al-Jurjani's own classification. Stern's basic emphasis in his classification of transferences is laid on the intentional nature of the transfer creating a metaphor 2, a feature which al-Juriini himself has emphasised. When intentional transfer is used for emotional (including aesthetic) reasons, then the figures of speech, of which metaphor is one, are produced.3 It is obvious that Stern's concept of the expressive and purposive functions of metaphor is responsible for his two divisions of this figure. Metaphor in his classification can be based on similarity and on relations other than similarity. Stern rejects the concept held by most writers that the relation in a metaphor is always one of similarity.4 However, he points out that metaphors based on this relation are probably more frequent than the other type.5 What is relevant to the purpose of this study is that Stern has emphasised the distinction between the similarity relation and other relations as his basis for the classification of the various types of I Brooke-Rose mentions Stern's classification in her study of the linguistic classifications. 2 Op.ci/. pp. 298-299 3 Ibid. p. 299, also p. 293, "Intentional transfer is distinguished from regular transfer by being intentional (see 11.13). Figures of speech differ from intentional transfer by the emotional nature of their causes (see 11.14)". ' Ibid. p. 309. This may seem contradictory to the statement made earlier in the present paper, namely, that the basis of the classification by dominant trait is the similarity relation. The contradiction, however, does not exist. For, even though Stern recognises a type of metaphor which is not based on similarity, in the classi- fication of this type of metaphor he does not use the principle of dominant trait, or as he calls it "common element". See Ibid. p. 314 and pp. 326-330. 5 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 55 transfers, and that he considers this distinction "applicable to metaphors".' On the other hand, he classifies the type of metaphor which is, ac- cording to him, based on similarity2 on the basis of the resembling attributes or dominant trait. His classification of metaphors based on similarity3 is formulated as follows: ". . . among the metaphors based on similarity we may, for the moment, make divisions according to the nature of the common element." The similarity may refer to (1) the appearance, (2) the qualities, functions, activities, or (3) the perceptual or emotional effects of the reference. With a larger and more diversified body of material, it might have been possible to make further distinctions along these lines.4 This classification occurs in nouns. As for adjectives, Stern says: "Most adjectives denoting qualities of concrete objects can be used metaphorically of abstract things . . . synaesthesia is . .. very common in adjectives." 6 This principle also applies to verbs.6 Under these headings Stern classifies a great number of sub-divisionls as follows: 1. Similarity of Appearance (a) Object's Name for Object, (b) Object for Person, (c) Proper Names in Appellative Use. 2. Similarity of Quality, Activity, or Function (a) Object's Name for Other Object, (b) Object for Person, (c) Quality for Person, (d) Animal for Person, (e) National Name (used for Individual) in Appellative Use, (f) Proper Name in Appellative Use, (g) Place Names in Appellative Use. 3. Similarity of Perceptual or Emotive Effect (a) Synaesthesia, (b) Abusive Words as Endearments, (c) Appreciative or Depreciative Uses. Adjectives and verbs are not sub-divided. 1 Ibid. pp. 273-294. "There are two possibilities, the first of these is to distinguish transfers based on similarity from those based on other relations... the same distinction is applicable to metaphors... since it is thus evidently an important point of view, I shall take it for my first basis of classification." 2 Mlany of Stern's examples fall under headings of al-majdZ al-mursal in al-JuriAni's work. 3 Ibid. p. 314. Stern confines himself to metaphorical words, leaving out of account metaphorical phrases. It is the former type of metaphors only which al-Jurjani classifies. Mloreover, he does not call the type which is based on phrases istijjra. 4 Ibid. p. 314. 5 Ibid. p. 314. 6 Ibid. p. 326.</page><page sequence="9">56 AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'ARA The Similarity Relation in Ullmann's Classification of Metaphor Ullmann's classification of metaphor is one of the latest and probably most closely knit systems in the analysis of metaphor. The basis of this classification is a clear distinction between two well- defined relations in the process of transference. These two relations are similarity and contiguity.1 The emphasis on these relations is apparent in the fact that they form major criteria by which Ullmann judges the contribution of such writers as Combocz and Roudet to the 'functional classification' of semantic change, which he has perfected. The functional classification is formulated by Ullmann as follows: (A) Semantic changes due to linguistic conservatism. (B) Semantic changes due to linguistic innovation. (i) Transfers of names: (a) through similarity between the senses. (b) through contiguity between the senses. (ii) Transfers of senses: (a) through similarity between the names. (b) through contiguity between the names. (iii) Composite changes 2 The most important part of Ullmann's classification for the purpose of the present study is Section (B) (i). For it is on this aspect of transference that al-Jurj ini has concentrated his activities.3 But it is part (a) of this section which concerns us more at present. It is here that Ullmann's classification of metaphor is produced and Ullmann himself calls this part ".. . in many ways the most crucial division of diachronistic semantics." 4 It is of vital interest to notice that the crucial role he attributes to the similarity relation is accompanied by a statement that what the similarity is based on is a "common denominator", between SI and S2, the two senses involved in the transference.5 This common denominator determines the mechanism of metaphor: 1 Op. cit. p. 267. Ullmann says ". . . the two most vital categories of semantic change, name transfers based on sense similarity and those reflecting contig- uity between the senses." 2 Ibid. p. 220. Ullmann uses transfer "in a neutral sense, without any implication as to the intentional or unintentional, sudden or gradual nature of the change". It is of interest that al-Jurjani failed to distinguish between the intentional, utl- intentional, sudden or gradual types of transfer. 8 However, it is possible to establish certain links between (B) (ii) and al-Juriani's work, such as his study of majdz in ellipsis. 4 Ibid. p. 213. 5 Ibid. p. 223.</page><page sequence="10">AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 57 "The mechanism at work is implicit in the diagram. Sense Si has somefeatures in common with some other sense 1 S2, lying within its asso- ciative field. At a given moment attention will be focused solely on the common denominator, or the overlap between their semantic ranges and the name pertaining to SI, Ni will be felt as an adequate designation for S2, quite irrespective of whether S2 did or did not have an N2 at its command." Ullmann suggests two terms to describe the types of similarity: "substantial and emotive similarity. The former will be responsible for anthropomorphic transfers like 'leg of a table, foot of a hill . . .' While the substantial similarity transfers may be tinged with affective nuances, they are rooted in some referential tertium comparationis. Emotive similarity, on the other hand, entirely depends on the analogous impact and effective resemblance of the two senses. A special sub- group is formed by transfers of physical sensation to mental states, 'bitterness', 'sweet temper', 'warm feelings'. Not unrelated is the use of abusive terms as endearments .". " 2 It will be shown later that these divisions and sub-groups cor- respond to al-Jurjani's distinction between two types of similarity: one is what he calls "the very physical existence of the attribute" (fi hakizat al-sifa), the other is what he calls "a natural consequence correlated to the attribute"(fi muktadd al-sifa).3 To this latter division in al-Jurjani's work Ullmann's division of "Synaesthesia" 4 also corresponds. The final feature of Ullmann's classification of metaphor discussed here is the fact that it is also based on the'dominant trait;"... this classification is based on the nature of the similarity itself".5 An Evaluative Approach Unlike the classifications discussed up to now which are produced by semanticists who were concerned with metaphor as a factor in semantic change, al-Jurj ani's classification of isti'dra is an organic part of his critical theory of construction. The basic feature of this theory is its concentration on the study of style and the nature and 1 (Italics mine). 2 Ibid. p. 224-225. 3 Asrdr al-Baldgba, edited, with an introduction, by H.

Ullmann proceeds to establish another "alternative or funda- mentum derived from the mechanism of the process". This new classification is irrelevant to the present study because it is not confined to category (i) (a).</page><page sequence="11">58 AL-JURJANI' S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI' ARA function of artistic expression. In the main, the principles on which al-Jurj ani bases his theory of construction are psychological. These principles are derived from analysing the nature of artistic experience and its expression in two phases: the first phase is its formulation in the psyche of the creator, its relation to him and the psychological process which shapes the literary expression. The second phase is its impact on the recipient, its interaction with him, and the psychological factors which shape his comprehension of and reaction to the literary expression.' The study of the two phases of literary creation are also applied at great length to one of the most important elements of artistic expression, namely, poetic imagery. Instances of the study of these two phases are numerous in both of al-Jurjini's books. His analysis of the first phase is based entirely on a fundamental principle concerning the psychological structure of literary expression. He formulates this principle as follows: "The nature of the process of construction is based on the under- standing of the grammatical functions of words because you [as a creator of a literary expression] establish an arrangement of the meanings [or concepts] in your psyche, and then arrange your words according to the first arrangement. . . One can not create an arrange- ment of words except when one has thought of [and arranged] the meanings".2 Thus, the inner arrangement determines all the elements of the literary expression, including imagery which, al-Jurjani says, is "an organic element in the construction, which is inseparable from it. All these figures contribute to the creation of the construction ... because it is impossible to find a noun or a verb in which the isti'dra occurs, which is not compound with other elements. Do you not see that if the word head in the [Kur'anic] verse 'My head has blazed with hoariness' was not thought of as a subject of the verb 'blazed' (ishta'ala) and the word 'hoariness' (shaiban), was not thought of as a specification (tamyiZ) no isticdra can be said to occur in the verse?" The principle of the inner arrangement of the meanings, which underlies the whole of al-Jurjani's theory of construction, is 1 It is obvious that a full treatment of this question is not possible here. It is inevitable for the present paper to rely on the opinion expressed above concerning the psychological principles of al-Jurj5n!'s theory without trying to establish the validity of such an interpretation. 2 Dalapil al-I'jaz edited by Rashid Rada, (third edition, Cairo, 1366 A.H.), p. 349.

Al-Jurijni says: "The consideration [of the question] of construction should be concentrated on the state of the creator and composer of the artistic expression, and the analysis of the meanings must be one of the rela- tions of these meanings to this composer, and not to the hearer." 1 As for the second phase, namely, the analysis of the impact of the artistic expression, or, for our purpose, of poetic imagery, on the recipient, it is thought sufficient to quote one instance at present, because a fuller treatment will be produced later. Al-jurjani discusses tajnis,2 commenting on its various types, those which are pleasant, and those which are not. His view of the effectiveness and pleasantness of this branch of badi' is based entirely on its impact on the recip- ient, and the psychological process which is involved in the recipient's reaction to the expression. His comment is: ".... the pleasantness [of this example] is due to the fact that the poet has repeated the same word in your hearing, as if he was deceiving you by giving the impression that there is no new additional meaning or significance when, in fact, he has given you this significance... In another example [where the two words differ only in the last letter], the reason for the pleasantness is the same, that is, the giving of an additional or new significance, in the form of a non-significant repe- tition. For here you imagine, when you hear the first word and then the second word before you come to its end, that you have heard the same word, and that the new one is a form of emphasis. The word, then, establishes itself in your psyche, and you hear its end, and sudden- ly all your previous impressions vanish, and you have a new meaning. This is what I mentioned to you before saying that it is the process of getting a significance after being in despair of getting any signi- ficance, and it is a form of achieving profit after you were deceived and made to feel that it was only the capital you had which ... ."3 Al-Jurj ini's analysis of poetic imagery in general, and isti'dra in particular, has another basic difference from the classifications consi- dered earlier. Whereas these classifications are in the main descriptive, al-Jurj ni's classification is evaluative. His interest is not in discover- " Ibid. p. 320. See also p. 406, "... . speech consists of concepts, or meanings (ma'dni) which are created by the composer in his psyche, and which he considers in his mind, and whispers to his heart." 2 Tajnis, or paronomasia, is using the same word in two different meanings, or using two words which share most of their sounds in the same expression. 3 Asrir, pp. 8, 18.</page><page sequence="13">60 AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA ing the laws which govern the process of transference, although he sketches out a valid scheme for the relations involved in this process.' Even when he does this, though, his concern is with its relation to his basic thesis of the importance of ma/dt to provide evidence for the nature of literary expression, its psychological basis, and its relation to his theory concerning the role of "meaning and words" (al-ma'nd wa al-lafZ). Trhe evaluative approach adopted by al-Jurj ani is of immense influence on his concept of the classification of isti'ara, and his studies on the nature of the resembling attribute, or dominant trait, or as he calls it, al-khdssa al-ra'i.s!yya or akhass al-f ifdt.2 Another direct result of al-Jurjani's evaluative approach is his concentration, in his analysis of isti'dra, on examples taken from Arabic poetry, the Kur'an, and, to a much less extent, artistic prose instances. This makes the question of popular and poetical metaphor, or, as Stern puts it, regular transfer and elaborate poetical metaphor, irrelevant to his classification. The difference between the evaluative and the descriptive approaches has also strong bearings on the analysis of the two psychological phases pointed out earlier. For it is natural that in an evaluative classification of metaphor, the central issue will be: What are the criteria which make a certain image, or for our purpose, a certain metaphor, more expressive and of greater emotional and aesthetic effect than another? To answer this question requires an analysis of the two phases mentioned above. It is of interest to notice that Stern has complained that the psychological process in the psyche of the creator of metaphor has always been overlooked. Stern himself concentrates on this process and ignores the psychologic- al process of the recipient completely, saying "It is evident, however, that the genesis of a metaphor lies entirely with the speaker. It is the speaker who perceives the association on which the metaphor is based and formulates its peculiar linguistic expression". Stern goes on to say: "The characteristics of metaphors must therefore be sought in the speaker's mental process and in the linguistic form in which he gives them expression. The hearer's part is to adapt himself to the 1 Al-Juriini's classification of the relations of tranference in majlz, is of great interest in its own turn. It will be interesting to compare his scheme with those of modern semanticists, especially Ullmann's, such a comparison is likely to yield important results. However, in the present paper, this will be done only in so far as it affects the classification of istldra. 2 It is remarkable that al-Juriani's term is the direct translation into Arabic of the "Dominant Trait".</page><page sequence="14">AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'CARA 61 speaker's mood and to comprehend the unusual symbol." 1 Needless to say, the concentration on the speaker's role is a result of the des- criptive nature of Stern's study. Contrary to this, al-Jurj ani tries to discover the impact of the nature of the dominant trait and its two most important features which determine the emotional and aesthetic effect on the recipient, namely its degree of exaggeration and fusion between the referents of metaphor, and its remoteness and strangeness,2 which make it more pleasant. The evaluative nature of al-Jurjamni's classification which is based mainly on the two factors just mentioned, is the basis of his divisions of metaphors by dominant trait. The term "dominant trait" here is accordingly different from its usage in the previously discussed classifications. In the latter, the dominant trait is merely mentioned. No attempt is made to show its emotional and aesthetic impact on the pleasantness of the metaphor. In fact, in many instances, as in the studies of Paul, and to a lesser degree Stern's and Ullmann's, this dominant trait is not even mentioned, and the study of the metaphor is confined to pointing out the nature of the domains of the referents, whether they are abstract, animate or inanimate.3 It will be shown that in al-Jurjani's work, this does not happen. Even when he analyses the nature of the domains of the referents, he is concerned with the impact of this nature on the basic theme in isticara, namely, the degree of fusion, remoteness and strangeness. Al-Jurjdni's Analysis of the Point of Similarity Al-Jurjani devotes a major part of his book Asrdr al-Baldghia to analysing the nature of the point of similarity wajh al-shabah, which is all-important to his whole work on poetic imagery. He does not classify isti'ara only according to the characteristics of wajb al- shabah; he also distinguishes between the various figures of speech on this basis. His analysis of the resembling attributes is naturally 1 Op. cit. p. 301; see also pp. 304-305. 2 The terms remoteness and strangeness need to be examined closely to show al-Jurjani's criterion of the pleasantness of istilira. However, a full analysis is not possible here. In broad lines, these terms mean the degree of remoteness of isticira from plain statement and the degree of the intellectual effort required to perceive it and to comprehend it. 3 See Stern, op. cit. pp. 314-318. For instance: "Abstract for Abstract... Knowledge is light, passion is fire ... so we speak of a ray of hope". Compare with al-JurjAni's study of the same example: Asrdr p. 83. Also Ullmann, op.cif. p. 224.</page><page sequence="15">62 AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA based on his concept of isti'dra and its relation to simile and com- parison.' Isti'dra, al-Jurj ani says, is based on transference involving the similarity relation.2 Thus similitude is its basis, and the mechanism of discovering this similitude preoccupies him very strongly. As a fundamentum for the discovery of similitude, al-Jurjmni analyses the mental and psychological processes which occur in the creator's psyche (al-nafs). The mechanism, he says, is that "the mushabbib" 3 of an object with another concentrates on the attribute (al-waf ) which is common to both objects,4 and excludes [from his thinking] 5 everything else. For instance, if he uses a lion in a comparison, he perceives 6 "the image of braveness only and ignores all other [attributes] . . . " 7 As the point of similarity, or akhass al-avwdf, varies in its remote- ness 8 and in the intellectual effort, on the creator's part, required to perceive it, the mental processes vary from the immediate association I For instance, he distinguished tashbih from tamthil according to the simple or complex nature of the point of similarity and the degree of intellectual effort (al-djiat cild al-ta'awwul) required to comprehend this point. See Asrdr, pp. 85-87. 2 A major difference between Aristotle's concept of metaphor and al-Jurjani's concept of isticdra lies in the relation between metaphor and simile (Aristotle) and isticdra and lasbbib (al-Jurjani). The former says that the simile is a metaphor put differently (Rhetoric ILl, 4, 1405b. Also 1412b-1413a, especially 1413a where he says ". . . and that similes are metaphors has been stated often already.") Al-Jurjani establishes a sharp distinction between isti'dra and tashbih in many aspects-as far as transference is concerned, in the linguistic form, and most important, the degree of fusion between the referents (Op. cit. pp. 220-222). The two critics also take opposite stands on the possibility of turning a simile into a metaphor (or into isticdra). Aristotle believes that "All these ideas may be expressed either as similes or as metaphors: those which succeed as metaphors will obviously do well also as similes, and similes, with the explanation omitted, will appear as metaphors" (Rhetoric III, 4, 1406b). Al-Juriani rejects this opinion very strongly. He devotes whole chapters to prove it wrong (needless to say, he does not refer to Aristotle at all, but to the concept as expressed by earlier Arab critics). He holds that it is the nature of the point of similarity which determines whether this is possible or not. Some similes can be expressed as metaphors, others can not (Asrdr, pp. 224-228). 3 "The establisher of the comparison". I retained the Arabic word because it is derived from the same root as "tashbbh" which is different from the English "comparison" (Arabic: mukdrana). 4 "Al-wasf al-ladhJyajmac bain al-shai'ain". 5 " Yanfi "an nafsih al-flkr fimd siwdh". 6 "Alkd surat al-shajd'a baina cainaihi".

Al-jurj5ni repeats this view in numerous other places in his book s. 8 Asrar p. 381.</page><page sequence="16">AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI' ARA 63 which links two objects in the mind, to a more complicated process of "remembrance, search for the images which the psyche has stored, evoking the imagination to visualise and analyse these images and bring out what was absent . . .'" 1 Between these two poles of immediate association where there is no need for interpretation (ta'awwuf) and the search of the psyche where the need for ta'awwul is so great, fall the various types of domi- nant traits according to which metaphors are classified. The Factors bhich Contribute to the Need for Ta'awwul in the Dominant Trait The psychological principles of al-Jurj ani's theory of construction and its elements have already been pointed out. Some of these prin- ciples are applied to his analysis of the beauty of the point of similar- ity and its appeal to the hearer, and to the formation of isti'dra in the creator's mind. His analysis of these two aspects of isti'dra are inter-related, for it is the intellectual effort required for the ta'awwuul of the point of similarity which is responsible for its distinction. Al-Jurjaini states that very clearly.2 He then proceeds to analyse the factors which contribute to the remoteness and strangeness of the point of similarity. He points out two fundamental reasons which are responsible for its strangeness: 1. The principle of the comprehension of details. 2. The principle of the scarcity of repetition of contact with the senses. The first principle is based on a psychological view of the process of comprehension. Al-Jurjan! holds that "the whole is comprehended more immediately than the details".3 Applied to the senses, this means that "the sense of sight does not comprehend the details immediately and without any effort, but you see at first glance the whole in general, then, by a repetition of the act of looking, you see the details. This also applies to hearing and all other senses." 4 Ibid. p. 144: "Bacda tathabbut wa faly 1i al-nafs can al-suwar allati Ia"rifuhd wa tabrik li al- Wahm ]i dhdlika wa istih/dar md ghaba minhu." The emphasis on the conscious nature of this process is a basic feature of such works as Paul's, Stern's, Ullmann's, Wundt, and Winkler, (see, for the latter two, Brooke-Rose op. cit. p.12). 2 Asrar. p. 128. 3 Ibid. p. 142 "Innd naclam anna al-jumla abadan asbak ild al-nuffr min al-tafslu". 4 The whole of this page is of great interest for the analysis of this principle. It is useful to read the detailed argument put forward here.</page><page sequence="17">64 AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA According to the capacity to comprehend the details (al-taffi/), one viewer or hearer is said to be better than another. But all viewers or hearers comprehend the wholeness (al-jumal), at equal levels. This principle applies not only to sensory comprehension, but also to the intellectual and psychological one.' As an application of this principle, there are various types of domi- nant traits which are classified according to their degree of detailed similitude, or "according to the placement of the description in the categories of 'wholeness' or 'detailedness'; and the deeper it goes into detail, the greater is the need for consideration and reflection." 2 An instance may be quoted here: if an object has the dominant trait "redness", one could compare it to another object whose dominant trait is "redness" as well. Here the "redness" is of a general nature without any detailed characteristics. On the other hand, the "redness" may be "bright". The need here for more search for an object whose dominant trait is "bright redness," is greater than in the first case. In the latter type more details are involved.3 However, in these two types, the degree of detail involved is small. Al-Jurjdn! quotes other instances where the detail is of a fat more complex nature. The poet Umru' al-Kais says: .... a lance which was as though its tip were a gleam of fire unsullied by smoke." Another poet, namely 'Antara, says: ". . . a sword like the blazing firebrand." Comparing these two lines, al-Jurjani says: "Here you find a great diflerence in their merits and success, although 'the thing compared with (al-mushabbah bihi)' is the same in both of them. This is only because the former achieved a delicate and fine degree of detail, whereas the latter contented himself with comparing the wholes. It is obvious that this degree of detail does not occur to the imagination immediately, but is the result of analysis and careful consideration of the objects compared." 4 As for the second principle, namely, the scarcity of the repetition of contact with the senses,5 al-Juriani's view is that the more the eyes see I Ibid. p. 147. 2 Ibid. I Ibid. pp. 147-148. 4 Ibid. pp. 149-150. Al-Juriani goes on to say: "If you think that this is possible to achieve instinctively without the search of the psyche of the poet for the images which are restored there. .. you are completely mistaken, and you are assuming the impossible.." 5 Ibid. pp. 151-164.</page><page sequence="18">AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'ARA 65 of an object, the more deeply rooted its image in the psyche (al-nafs) is, thus it is always present to the senses, and conversely.' Al-Jurjini's conclusion derived from this principle is that "every similarity which is based on a trait or image or form which is always present to the sense of sight, leads to a base and very ordinary simile. On the other hand, the similes which are based on the opposite type of similarity are strange, rare and creative." 2 Similes vary according to "their relation to this principle".3 There is another type of remoteness which is achieved when these two principles are combined in one isti'dra. This type is one of the highest degrees of remoteness which can be achieved.4 The study of the factors which contribute to the remoteness of the point of similarity has made it possible to proceed now to give a fuller account of al-Jurj ini's basic divisions of the types of dominant traits. Al-Jurjani's view of making a comparison between two objects is that this could be based on two types of similitudes: the first is the type which is "obvious" and does not require further interpreta- tion (ta'awwul). The second is comprehended only by intellectual effort and interpretation.5 The first type is represented by such physical characteristics as "form, colour, or a combination of both form and colour, dimensions, sounds, smells. Under this category fall all the moral traits such as courage, cunning, etc".6 In other words, this category includes every- thing which is comprehended through the senses, and the moral and instinctive traits. According to al-Jurjani, in this group no ta'awwul is required be- cause "one is aware of the existence of redness in both the cheek and the rose and one sees it in both, in the same way that one 'knows' the existence of courage in the lion as one knows of its existence in the man".7 The second type of dominant trait which can only be realised by ta'awwul is sub-divided into three arouns: This certainly applies in its entirely to isti'ara. 2 Ibid. p. 151. See also pp. 158-159. Al-JuriAni proceeds to discuss the various methods of achieving each of those two characteristics in poetry, see pp. 151-154. 3 Ibid. pp. 157-158. 4 Ibid. pp. 80-81 ". . . min jihat amr baiyyin lUyuktij fih ild la'aowwul, wa al-akhar anyakun al-shabah muhassalan bi darb min al-ta'awwul." 5 Ibid. pp. 81-82. 6 Ibid. 7 Ibid. Journal of Arabic Literature, It 5</page><page sequence="19">66 AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 1. The first group requires the least possible degree of ta'awwul, and it is so easy to comprehend, that it almost belongs to the first type of dominant trait. A case in point is "The argument is like the sun in its clarity". Al-Jurjani comments on this example as follows: "Here you have compared the argument with the sun from the point of view of its clarity, just as you had previously compared two objects from the point of view of their colours or forms. But nevertheless, you know that the comparison in question could not be achieved except with an intellectual effort and interpretation (ta'awwul). This can be done by realizing that the reality of the clarity of the sun and other similar objects lies in the fact that there is no veil on such objects which may conceal them and make the eye incapable of seeing them. This is why an object appears clearly to one's eye. For, had there been such a veil, it would not have been clear. You then realize that uncertainty is like a veil to the mind and intellect because it pre- vents the heart from seeing the doubtful object. . . and this is why doubt is described as veiling things from the intellect which tries to discover their realities. Therefore, if the uncertainty vanishes, an understanding of the meanings of the composition you are consi- dering occurs, and the discovery of the truthfulness of the argument is achieved, so that one can say: 'This is as clear as the sun', meaning that there is nothing to conceal it from the understanding, or to throw doubt on it. . . like the clear sun which cannot be denied or concealed. Now you can see that you needed a certain degree of taawwul to interpret this comparison between the argument and the sun, and to comprehend it." 1 2. The second group requires a higher degree of ta'awwul, but it is still easy to comprehend immediately. This group is very similar to the first one. An instance is "His words are like honey in sweetness, the breeze in gentleness, and water in fluency". In this instance, accor- ding to al-Jurjani, "The purpose is to describe the easiness and familiarity of the expression, and to show that it is not strange or odd or unpleasant, as well as to describe the harmony between its various elements. This makes it like pure water which one enjoys drinking... This inter- pretation is based on /a'awwul because it requires an intellectual effort to relate something to something else and discover their con- nections. Therefore this form of expression is in a higher rank of /a'awwul than the first, and the need in it for an intellectual effort is greater than in the first one." 2 1 Ibid., pp. 82-3. 2 Ibid., pp. 83-4.</page><page sequence="20">AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 67 3. The third group is not comprehended immediately and it requires a great degree of ta'awwul. This is the type which is found only in the most distinguished works of literature. An instance of this group is the expression "They were like a ring cast of metal, whose ends are not recognisable". "As you can see", al-Jurjani says, "this obviously requires a great degree of ta'awwul, intellectual effort and careful analysis. Do you not see that no one can understand it rightly except him who has sharpness of mind and penetration, which distinguish him from ordinary people? It is clear that the comparison of the argument to the sun is not of this nature, for it is common and ordinary and is known by both the clever and the stupid. You can also say this about the second type concerning the comparison of the words to water, because you can find it in the speech of or- dinary people. As for the type 'They are like a ring of cast metal . . .', you can only find it in the best of literature and the works of the noble and those who have perfect minds." 1 The classification according to the degree of ta'awwul needed, al- Jurj ini says, is a result of the basic nature of the resembling attribute or dominant trait, in which the ishtirdk 2 occurs. This ishtirdk may be established either in the trait itself (ft nafsiha wa hakaiat jinsihd), or in an adventitious implication of this trait. The cheek shares with the rose redness itself, and you find redness existing physically in both objects. Whereas words do not share with honey sweetness as a physical element, they share with honey a condition of it and a contingency which is the feeling of pleasure felt by someone tasting honey, and the psychological state which prevails in the psyche during the tasting of something which is appealing ... The similar- ity, then, lies in the psychological state occurring both when the hearer hears the words, and when he tastes honey. If these two psychological states materialised, they would have the same image and would be as harmonious with each other as the redness of the cheek is harmo- nious with the redness of the rose.3 Al-Jurjani's conclusion at which he arrives at this point is that 1 Ibid. 1 would like to acknowledge the help of Professor A. F. L. Beeston in translating this and some other quotations from al-Jurjini. I would like also to acknowledge his useful remarks on this article. 2 "Link" is not the best word to translate ishtirdk, but it seems difficult to suggest a more exact translation at present. 3 Ibid. p. 88 "...al-isblirdk fi al-fifa yaka' marratan ft nafsihd wa hakikat jinsiha wa marralanfz hukm laba wa mukiadd."</page><page sequence="21">68 AL-JURJANI' S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA ta'awwul is required when the similitude occurs in the adventitious implication of the trait and not in its physical nature. The former type of similitude is called by al-Jurjamn "the intellectual similitucle" (al-shabah al-'aklz), the latter is "the apparent or original similitude" (al-mushdbaha al-afliyya al-Vdhira).' He considers this latter type "the real and original similitude", and the former type "a branch of it which is based entirely onit".2 The Classification of Isti'dra It is according to the nature of the dominant trait as analysed here that al-Jurja.ni has classified isti'dra. The counterpart to the nature of the dominant trait in his classification is his concept of isli'dra as being based on "lending the meaning of one object to another object, the aim being the attribution of the dominant trait in the first object to the second one".3 On the basis of this concept of isti'dra, and according to his analysis of the nature of the dominant trait, al-Jurj ani suggests a classification of this figure into two divisions. The first is "the non-significant type" (al-isti'dra ghair al-mufida), the second is "the significant type" (al- isti'dra al-mufida).4 In the first type the terms of the isti'dra originally signify the same referents, but in two different objects, e.g. the word "lip" (al-shafa) signifies the same referent as the word al-jahfala, the only differ- I Ibid. p. 90. 2 Ibid. p. 89. 3 Ibid. p. 375. In Dala'il, al-Jurjani argues convincingly that the view that islicdra is a transference (nakl) of a name from its original significance to signify something else is wrong, (see Dala'il, pp. 331-332). His argument is that in forming an is1i'dra the process is one of borrowing the meaning or attributes of an object to be attributed to another object. For, he argues, in the process one does not change the meaning of the borrowed name; it is essential that this meaning should be present in the mind when an isticira is being formed. Ibid. pp. 333-335. This is the opposite of the whole line of reasoning in European studies, which originates in Aristotle's definition: "Metaphor consists in giving something the name of something else". Ullmann, for instance, classifies metaphor as "a name transfer". Al-Jurjani rejects this, and his view is crucial for the study of semantic change. It shows that the name does not change its meaning in metaphor. This only happens when metaphor fades and becomes a dead metaphor. It is obvious that while the metaphor is still active, no change of meaning can possibly occur. This aspect of al-Jurjdini's concept of isticdra will not be analysed in this study. 4 Asrdr, p. 29.</page><page sequence="22">AL-JURJANi'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'ARA 69 ence being that the former signifies the lip in a human being, the latter in an animal'L. Such a use of words produces no distinct achievement. In fact, al-Jurjaini says that he prefers not to call it isfi'cra at all.2 However, the same phenomenon could be said to achieve a certain aesthetic effect, and in this case it should not be confused with this type, but should be considered as belonging to the second division, namely al-isti'dra al-mufida. Al-Jurjaini produces as an instance of this type a disputed image which, he says, had been described as a non-significant isti'dra. His analysis of it shows that it is a significant one used for certain artistic effects. The poet Muzarrad says: "The children had hardly fallen asleep when I saw him [the guest] urging his camel [to move fast towards my tent] by hitting it on its sides with his leg and his hoof." 3 Al-Jurjani analyses this image in the light of its organic relation to the other elements of the poem. Thus, seeing it in its context, he says that, "even though the poet did not want to express his scorn of the guest by attributing the word hoof (al-.hfir) to him instead of using the word foot (al-kadam), nevertheless, the poet aimed at describing the miserable state in which the guest was, and his long aimless journey in the desert, and at describing vividly his desperate effort in pushing his animal. In fact the poet has described his guest as having a miserable physical appearance. All these facts make it almost natural for him to talk about the hoof of the man to show the strength of his urging his animal to go fast." 4 As for significant isti'dra, it can be classified into three divisions: 1. The type in which "the meaning of the borrowed term exists in the proper term in reality as a general category but nevertheless this meaning (quality or characteristic) can be classified in a scale of excellence and non-excellence, or of strength and weakness; you may borrow the word from the more excellent and apply it to the less excellent, e.g. the application of the quality of 'flight' to something without wings." The analysis of this type produced here reads: "when you lend the quality of 'flight' to something without wings, to show its speed, or when you use the fall of the stars to apply to 1 Ibid. pp. 29-31. 2 Ibid. p. 373. 3 "Famd rakada al-wilddnu batt ra'aitubu Cald al-bakriyamribi bi-sdkin wa bdfiri 4 Ibid. pp. 35-36.</page><page sequence="23">70 AL-JURJANI'S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI'ARA a horse which runs fast, or when you describe a horse as swimming to express his running fast. It is known that flying, the falling of an object, swimming and running all belong to one category (jins), in the sense that they are all movements. The characteristics of objects [or bodies] (ajsdm) are distinguished by separate names, but when a poet sees in one of those ajsadm a movement which is similar to the movement of another, he then borrows the word from the latter to the former. Thus they say the horse has flown." 1 2. A type which is similar to the first, but is not identical with it. In this type, the similitude is taken from a trait which exists in both objects in reality, as is the case in the phrase "I saw a sun", meaning a man whose face shines (yatahallal) like the sun. This, al-Jurjani says, is similar to the example quoted in the first type, because the similitude is taken from the trait "shining" which exists in the face of the smiling man (al-insdn al-rnutahallil),2 The difference between these two types, according to al-Jurjani is one of the nature of the point of similarity in each of them. In the first type, the attribute is the same, existing in two different objects, whereas in the second type, it is not one attribute which is involved. It is rather two attri- butes which belong to the same category, but differ in the degree of excellence and strength in each of the objects compared.3 3. The type which represents isti'dra at its highest degree of pleasantness and superiority. Here similitude is taken from "intellectual images", like borrowing light to describe eloquence and arguments.4 This type of isti'dra is described as "the pure type" (al-samirn al- khilis minha). Comparing the nature of the dominant trait in this type with the first and the second types al-Jurijni says: "Here you are certain that the similarity between light and argument is not the same as the one existing between the flight of a bird and the running of a horse, as far as sharing the general nature of the category of the qualities is concerned. For light is a quality of physical or concrete objects and argument is words. Nor is the similarity in this third type and the similarity between a man and a lion the same, because the latter two share a definite and known quality existing in the animal such as courage. The similarity between light and speech and argument 1 Ibid. pp. 51-52. See also pp. 53-58. 2 Ibid. p. 53. 3 Ibid. p. 59. 4 Ibid. p. 60. Al-Jurjani praises this type very highly.</page><page sequence="24">AL-JURJANI S CLASSIFICATION OF ISTI 'ARA 71 is that when the heart becomes aware of the argument [or hears it] it is transferred into a state or mood similar to that of the sense of sight when it meets light and when light illuminates everything for it. This, as you know, is not an attribute or similarity which is acquired from a category (fins) or instinct or form or image, but is an intel- lectual image." 1 This type is divided in its turn into three sub- divisions. a) The similitude is taken from sensorily comprehended objects and applied to intellectual meanings or concepts, i.e. concrete- abstract, for instance, when "light" is applied to argument and artistic expression.2 b) The similitude is between concrete objects, but the point of similarity is intellectual (abstract). An instance is the Tradition "Beware of the green plant growing on dung".3 "In this image the point of similarity is not the colour of the plant, its greenness, taste, smells, form or image. Nor is this point an instinctive quality or any such characteristic. The similarity is an intellectual one betweenl a beautiful woman who is brought up in a corrupt environment or who comes from a base origin, and a plant growing on dung. Thus the dominant trait is the 'beauty of the appearance to the eye accom- panied by the corruption of the inner world' and the goodness of the branch when the origin is corrupt . . ." 4 As a result of his analysis of this type of ist'dra, al-Jurjani comes to the conclusion that "the same word can be borrowed metaphorically in two different ways ... the first produces an isti'dra which is based on the concrete or physical characteristics of the word; the second produces an isti'dra based on attributes which are comprehended through the intellect, and are non-physical. Those two types are exemplified by the images 'the stars of guidance' applied to the com- panions of the Prophet, where the similitude is non-physical, and 'the stars' when the lanterns are compared to them, where the similarity is physical." 5 c) The similitude is taken from the intellectual to the intellectual, (abstract-abstract). This type has many forms, the most important of which are the following two: "The comparison of nothingness to 1 Ibid. p. 60. a Ibid. p. 61.

Those two forms are discussed in great detail, but it seems irrelevant to consider them in any detailed way in the present paper.1 In all three divisions, al- Turj an! concentrates on analysing the nature of the point of similarity and the intellectual effort required for its perception on the part of both the creator and the hearer.2 It is of interest to notice that he does not content himself with pointing out the domains of the terms involved in isti'dra; those domains are not mentioned for their own sake. He proceeds to define the nature of the point of similarity in each of them. This is evident in that he does not base his classification on the fact that the sun and the man belong to different domains, but on the physical existence of the point of similarity in both of them. It is also evident in his treatment of the borrowing of "light" to be applied to argument, which he classifies not according to the different domains involved in it, but to the ta'awwu/ needed to comprehend it.3 It is also interesting to notice that the relations of concrete-abstract and genus-species are men- tioned in certain examples, but here also they are not considered for their own sake. The concrete-abstract-concrete relation, for in- stance, is discussed only in so far as it affects the remoteness and strangeness of the point of similarity, and its physical or intellectual nature. This is evident in al-Jurjini's discussion of type (3) of isti'dra, as is the case in the Tradition quoted earlier, on which al-Jurijni com- ments: "Both woman and plant are physical bodies (a/sd;;), but the point of similarity or dominant trait is not the colour, greenness, taste, smell or form and image ... It is an intellectual image or similarity." 4 As for the genus-species relationship, it is obvious that in the only place where al-Jurjani mentions a similar type of relation, namely the second type of isti'dra, he is not concerned with this relation for its own sake. His analysis is concentrated on the nature of the domi- nant trait and the difference between this nature and the dominant trait in the first type. This difference, al-Jurijni says, is a direct result of the second type being based on a relation similar to the genus- 1 Ibid. pp. 67-68. 2 Ibid. pp. 61-78. 3 "The similarity is established between concrete objects, but the point of similarity is an intellectual one."

However, this aspect of al-Jurjani's study requires a fuller treatment than is possible here. It can form a major crite- rion when judging his classification by dominant trait in relation to the classifications discussed earlier in this paper. Nevertheless, even in its broad outlines considered here, it lends support to the thesis that al-Jurjani's classification of isti'dra is the most coherent and comprehensive classification by dominant trait analysed in the present paper. The classification of isti'dra as it is analysed above is confined to the type of isti'dra which is based on transference. However, al- }urj ani discusses another type of isti'dra which, he says, is not based on transference. In this type, the relation involved is likely to be an organisation of relations based on analogy. Al-Jurj ani does not use the term analogy to describe those relations, but he defines the type of examples in which this form of isti'ara is to be found, namely, personification, or the attribution of a human characteristic, usually a physical one, to an object.' However, even in this type, al-Jurjini's interest is not in the human/non-human domains, but in the nature of the relation involved, and the complex similitude established. This is evident in his analysis of the line: "Many a blustering cold morning have I encountered When its reins were held by the hand of the north wind" 2 Al-Jurjani comments on this type of isti'dra as follows: "You must know that there is a type of isti'ara which cannot be said to be based on transference . . . [In the line of Labid] it is certain that there is an istijcra in the word hand (yad). However, you cannot claim that this word is transferred from one thing to another. For the meaning is not that something is compared to the hand, in which case you can claim that "hand" is transferred to that thing. The meaning here is that the poet wants to compare the north wind in its control of the morning to a human being who holds something in his hand and controls it and moves it as he likes. When the poet attributed to the wind a similar action to that of a man using his hand, 1 Asrdr, pp. 43-44 and Dald'il, pp. 334-335. This type of istic'ra seems to correspond to Ullmann's "anthropomorphic metaphor" which is based on substantial, as opposed to emotive, factors. 2 Dala'il, p. 334.

This is true of all similar images, where a limb or a part of the body of a human being is attri- buted to objects . . .'' 1 As is obvious here, al-Jurjaini is not concerned with the domains of the terms involved in isti'dra, but with the point of similarity, which is of a complex nature. It seems safe to suggest that this is true of all examples which he discusses in his classification of isti'dra. It is hoped that the analysis of al-Jurjani's classification of isti'dra which has been carried out here has demonstrated the coherence and analytical nature of this classification. It has been shown that the three modern European critics who produced classifications of meta- phor by dominant trait were not always coherent. Their classifications turned out, in many instances, to be concrete-abstract, and domain of thought types. This makes al-Jurjiini's classification the truest representative of the classification by dominant trait discussed here. On the other hand, if one accepts Christine Brooke-Rose's criticism of the European classification by dominant trait as being "in the main psychological or linguistic, and not very helpful in literary criticism", 2 one will find it difficult to accept this criticism as true of al-Jurjani's classification by dominant trait. For, as has already been shown, al-Jurj ni's classification is an organic part of his theory of construc- tion. It is not easy either to accept Miss Brooke-Rose's criticism of this type of classification on the grounds that "it makes no distinction between metaphor and comparison".3 It has been shown that al- Jurjini makes a very sharp distinction between isti'ara and tashbih or simile. However, a fuller treatment of these and other points of Miss Brooke-Rose's criticism of the classification by dominant trait, to show that they do not apply to al-Jurjani's classification, is not possible here. The results arrived at in this study contribute to a closer analysis of the relation between Aristotle's classification of metaphor and al-jurjdni's classification of isti'dra. As has been stated earlier, the classification by dominant trait is said to be of a different nature from that of the genus-species one. Miss Brooke-Rose, for instance, finds links between the latter classification and the other types of classifica- tions she analyses, those by animate-inanimate and domain of thought.

Ullmann discusses what he calls "the logico-rhetorical classification" which, he says, is based on Aristotle's classification. Ullmann sees no link between this classification and his functional classification. As has been shown, Ullmann's classification of metaphor is based on similar principles to al-Jurijtni's one. In view of the studies of Brooke-Rose and Ullmann, it is possible to suggest that al-Jurjani's classification is of a completely different nature from Aristotle's. It shows that a further analysis of both Aristotle's and al-Jurjani's work on metaphor and isti'dra is imperative, before the work of a critic of al-Jurjani's qualities can be said to be "commentaries on Aristotle's views" as Thhi Husain has said. Furthermore, it is hoped that al-Jurj ni's work has been shown to be of value for modern studies of poetic imagery in general and isti'dra in particular. Undoubtedly, his achievement in this field can be of benefit if put in the context of modern criticism, not only in Arabic literature, but also in European languages. This is an aspect of al-Juriani's work which it is hoped can be given further analysis. KAMAL ABU DEEB</page></plain_text>
