<plain_text><page sequence="1">(48) A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF ELISE JENNY BAUMGARTEL By V. A. DONOHUE IN the appreciation which she contributed to the last volume of this Journal' Mrs. Payne has indicated the sorrow with which Elise Baumgartel's friends and collaborators will have received news of her death. There too are described Dr. Baumgartel's early studies, at first with Erman and Sethe at Berlin and then at Koenigsberg, where Wreszinski encouraged her to pursue that combination of conventional Egyptology and archaeology which gave direction to her future career and, in a subject which has benefited peculiarly little from the rigorous analysis of material culture, enabled her to complete a programme of research of the very greatest significance, alike in its elucida- tion of the earliest phases of Egyptian society, and in the example of its technique. Insistence that Nilotic prehistory could be understood only within a much wider context led her initially to concentrate upon related material from North Africa and the Mediterranean: her earliest publication sought to demonstrate that Egyptian funerary architecture of the first dynasties represented a fusion of the native single-grave tradi- tion with megaiithic influences from the west, incidentally, and characteristically, attacking the then-fashionable hyper-diffusionism of Elliot Smith and his followers at one of its most central propositions; and similar concerns, in particular the compara- tive study of stone implements, occupied her for the next ten years. Her removal to London in 1934, however, and succession to Margaret Murray's duties in the Egyptian collection at University College were to provide a new and lasting stimulus. Embarked upon a catalogue of predynastic antiquities from the classic series of excavations under- taken by Petrie at the turn of the century, and with access to a large body of more recently acquired information, she soon realized that the relative chronology which he had formulated on the basis of tomb-groups from Naqada was in need of substantial modification. In the absence of any comparable range of assemblages it was clear that this was only to be achieved by reconsideration of the original excavation itself,2 but since the detailed, unpublished registers were no longer available, it was first necessary to locate and examine afresh the many thousands of objects now dispersed throughout Europe and North America. Although thirty years were to elapse before this daunting task could be regarded as complete (below, 3 ), it was already well in hand when, relinquishing hope of seeing the full inventory of the London collection in print, Dr. Baumgartel published the first volume of her study of predynastic Egypt in I947 (I2).

The book was received with considerable enthusiasm, and as was inevitable with a work of such marked originality, written 'not to be believed, but to be argued about', it generated lively debate.4 A reprint of the first volume was called for within the year, to be followed in I955 by a revised version, whilst the appearance of the er t second volume prompted demands for a new edition of the whole, now happily complete. When in 1964 Dr. Baumgartel returned to Oxford, to renew her long association with the Ashmolean Museum and Griffith Institute, it might have been expected that, engaged upon revision and with the Naqada volume still to be finished, she would find little opportunity to initiate further work. On the contrary, her later years saw an increased productivity, with results as penetrating as anything that had gone before. Already in 1948, in reassessing the eccentric colossi discovered by Petrie at Koptos and believed by him to be prehistoric, she had shown that accepted interpretations of figurines from the 'main deposit' at Hieraconpolis and from the temple of Osiris at Abydos, which had been regarded as the principal evidence for protodynastic art, and might therefore have been used in comparison, were without foundation (I5). Both groups, it now emerged, had been dated by their excavators on the basis of the earliest objects found among them, whilst the circumstances of neither discovery provided a terminus ad quem earlier than the Eighteenth Dynasty.5 In this situation stylistic analysis alone could offer a guide for the dating of any individual piece, and in a number of recent articles an attempt was made to come to terms with the problem (27, 33). At the same time she returned to the discussion of the undoubtedly early mace-heads and palettes from Hieraconpolis, the carved scenes on which have so often been used to give a specious air of definition to the reconstruction of contemporary political events. An extended treatment of these, stressing their essentially ritual nature, had appeared in the second volume of Prehistoric Egypt; now the evidence which they have been thought to furnish for the existence of a protohistorical king Scorpion was examined anew and rejected (26), and it was the related interpretation of royal titles, on which 3 See also B.
