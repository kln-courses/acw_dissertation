It is double jeopardy when sev- eral claim it is misleading to their own contribution and misrepresentative  of the prospectus of the volume. And it is unusual and rare when the editor  welcomes his colleagues to vent and to write their charges in a public forum.   “It is striking and visual,” responded a delighted Charles Watkinson,  Director of Purdue University Press, to my suggestion that we select James  Tissot’s Jésus dans la synagogue déroule le livre (“Jesus Unrolls the Book in the  Synagogue”), painted in Provence, France between 1886 and 1894 and now  hanging in the Brooklyn Museum, as the cover for The Jewish Jesus: Revelation,  Reflection, Reclamation (West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 2011). The  Synoptic Gospels speak of Jesus preaching in the synagogue (Mark 6:1–6,  Matthew 13:54–58, and especially, Luke 4:16–30). Tissot’s painting suggests  Luke 4:18–19, where Jesus, touched by the Holy Spirit, reads portions of Isa- iah 61:1–2 and 58:6, proclaiming that the poor will be fed and clothed, the  oppressed become free, and the blind regain sight. As was the custom of his  people, Jesus was celebrating a Sabbath Synagogue moment, reading from the  Book which succinctly captures a contention in our book, Jesus in the proxim- ity of Jewish revelation. So I thought.  December 2010 was a real December dilemma. I requested and received  from all the contributors to The Jewish Jesus their corrected manuscripts in the  allotted time. That was done on December 5 (Fourth Day of Chanukka). The  next day, I sent with excitement to all the contributors the marketing material  on the Shofar Supplements Jesus volume (cover, content, blurb, post card),  NOT expecting for one moment the instant reaction to the book cover—from  “schmaltzy” to non-enlightened to reverting back to medieval Church trium- phalism—all seen in a nineteenth-century French Christian artist’s rendition  of Jesus reading from the Torah (scroll not “Book”) in a synagogue setting.  Steve Bowman adroitly commented, “With all due respect I cannot abide the  Front cover picture. It is too schmaltzy and East European. If you want a Jew- ish rebel rabbi (suggested by my words on the back cover), then perhaps a me- dieval picture of Judah Maccabee would do. (He was after all a messiah too.)”  Publication factors precluded the replacement of the Tissot picture. Dis- appointed but not depressed, I decided—wisely, in retrospect—to engage in  disclosure to bring closure. So my invitation to the seven savants, who agreed  to write: Thank you for accepting the invitation to comment on the cover to The Jewish  Jesus: Revelation, Reflection, Reclamation.

Responding to the Cover of The Jewish Jesus Steven Leonard Jacobs  University of Alabama The initial “controversy” (with a very, very small “c”)—which I genuinely would  like to call a machloqet l’shem shamayim/“disagreement for the sake of Heav- en”—in response to the cover our editor Zev Garber chose for the volume The  Jewish Jesus: Revelation, Reflection, Reclamation, which has engendered these  short essays as well as Zev’s rationale, is in the long-standing masorah/tradi- tion of Talmudic give-and-take.  If I understand French painter James Tissot (1836–1902) and Zev as  well, both see a positive place for Jesus (whatever his Hebrew name may have  been), the son of Miryam and Josef, within the totality of the Jewish religious  tradition and Jewish people, though Tissot bases himself upon the Book of  Luke and Jesus’ return to Nazareth and participation in worship on the Shab- bat, and Zev upon the conference papers originally presented at Case-Western  Reserve University in 2009 and the additional contributions as well. What  Tissot then depicts, presumably, is Jesus at the almemar/Torah stand, though  whether or not he is offering the Torah brachot/blessings or reading/chanting  the text is impossible to discern (his mouth is closed and Tissot does not say).  The faces of those in attendance span the gamut from indifference to atten- tion not unlike today’s synagogue. Additionally, whether or not their “street  clothes” are appropriate historically as well as the tallit/prayer shawl as an ad- ditional garment is both questionable and problematic with regard to the time  period at issue. What is not, however, again presuming the central figure to be the Christ,  is that there is no controversy here nor is his participation problematic. He is  a Jewish male above the age of majority, and, as such, has every right to par- ticipate in tefila/worship. One might also possibly conclude that his “stepping  up” is the result of an invitation from either the chazan/cantor or other sh’liach   Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="4"> 124 ♦ Zev Garber     tsibur/communal representative responsible for conducting the service itself.  I do question, however, whether Tissot himself was intimately familiar with  such details and seriously doubt it.  However, for the sake of argument (again with a very small “a”), let us as- sume that in the era before the birth of photography and later the birth of the  Internet, Tissot’s depiction of the moment is historically accurate. What then  is he trying to tell us and what are the implications for the Jewish religious  tradition and Jewish people? First, that Jesus was, indeed, very much a part of his living Jewish com- munity, accepted even if somewhat estranged from the normative textual in- terpretations proffered by the Pharisees with whom he constantly entered  into both discussion and debate. (It would fall to his followers, initially Jews  who themselves may not have been all that knowledgeable, and, later, gentiles  whose own knowledge of Judaic traditions and Judaic argument-counterargu- ment was something of an alien experience, to divinize this Jewish teacher.1) Second, the central question asked and answered in both the Gospel of  Mark 8:29–30 and Luke 9:20–21—“‘But what about you?’ he asked. ‘Who  do you say I am?’ Peter answered, ‘You are the Messiah.’” (Luke: “God’s Mes- siah.) “‘Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.’” (Luke: “Jesus strictly  warned them not to tell this to anyone.”)—would not have been a relevant  question on the Shabbat. Tissot’s painting gives no evidence whatsoever of  Jesus delivering a d’rasha/sermon; only of blessing or reading/chanting over  the Sefer Torah (the physical object itself reminiscent of Sephardic rather  than Ashkenazic tradition). Later generations of those poorly-termed “Jew- ish-Christians” would fall by the wayside, and Christianity would, ultimately,  evolve into a Gentilized rather than a Judaized expression of the divine-hu- man encounter, and, concomitantly, Jesus’ own Jewish identity would be hon- ored more in the breach than in reality by later generations of his followers  who would come to negate any positive relationship with Jews and Judaism  (that is, the so-called “parting of the ways,” to use Christian theologian Paul  van Buren’s [1924–1998] term). Third, welcoming Jesus back into the Jewish fold as an itinerant teacher/ comforter of a people oppressed by their Roman overlords opens the door  to two possibilities: (1) humanizing his life fully and totally, a position to- 1I, for one, continue to be uncomfortable with titling him as “Rabbi”—there being no  evidence in the New Testament texts themselves that he underwent any rigorous advanced  Jewish education nor acquired s’micha/ordination. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="5">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 125 tally unacceptable to Christians for whom his humanity/divinity as a whole  is central to faith; and (2) making of the New Testament, as the late Ellis  Rivkin (1918–2010), Adolph S. Ochs Professor of Jewish History at HUC- JIR/Cincinnati, once suggested to his students, a “midrashic commentary on  the Hebrew Bible,” and thus, perhaps, opening up a whole new way of reading  these texts. Thus, summarily, I find no disagreement with the choice of cover for this  book. Opening this volume opens conversations too long delayed but poten- tially fruitful in an environment where dialogical encounters continue to be  the norm. Let the machloqot begin! The Jesus Cover Sara Mandell  University of South Florida James Tissot’s work, “Jésus dans la synagogue déroule le livre” (Accession  Number: 00.159.71), is part of a rather large portfolio, “La Vie de Notre-Sei- gneur Jésus-Christ.” The work’s composition, opaque watercolor over graphite  on gray wove paper, is somewhat unusual, although woven paper itself is one  of two types of customarily used and popular papers for watercolors. What is  unusual is its gray color, which, even when not visible, lends the work an air of  the mystical that its sharp and clean lines would otherwise not permit. More- over, the type of opaque watercolor, gouache, was not only the lesser of the two  opaque types, but considered an inferior application to the transparent.  “Jésus dans la synagogue” is both interesting and informative of Tissot’s  perception regarding Jesus’ Jewishness, and it may give an insight into the way  gentiles perceived Jewish worship in the second half of the nineteenth century  in France. We know that depiction of people and their surroundings of any  era generally reflects the period and style employed by the artist. When we go  from one room to another in any great art museum, we see differences not only  in artistic technique even when the same medium is used, but in coloration  and dress; and, these help to date and locate an unsigned work’s provenience.  This type of authentication is not limited to paintings, but extends to church  iconography as well.  Despite his desire for realism as expressed in the “Introduction” to the  catalogue of “The Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ” (1899 exhibition at the Art  Institute of Chicago), in “Jésus dans la synagogue” Tissot depicts Jesus in what  appears to be a highly ornate place of worship, presumed to be the Jerusalem  Temple, as is suggested by the ritually significant and symbolic ornamentation  on the back of the bima and the chairs and benches, the Torah crowns draped   Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="6"> 126 ♦ Zev Garber     with a shawl (not a tallit as it is not fringed), and the multiplicity of what  appear to be some type of oil lamp. Likewise, we see the ornateness in “Jésus  porté sur le pinacle du Temple” (a work in the same portfolio), which may  reflect the elaborate nature of the Basilique Saint-Nicolas, which Tissot knew  in Nantes, or his exposure to the artwork of Delacroix (c. 1857–61) in the  Chapelle des Agnes at Saint-Sulpice in Paris where Tissot had his 1865 mys- tic experience. Delacroix’s Romantic style and orientally influenced religious  artworks may be particularly meaningful, since Delacroix had also had early  training in the Neoclassical under Jacques Louis David (1748–1875). On the  other hand, it may possibly reflect the ornateness in the Church in the Cister- cian Abbaye Notre-Dame d’Orval, where Tissot also spent time, although the  stone of the latter is yellow ochre and that in “Jésus dans la synagogue” is not.  And, despite the interior, the work may also have been influenced by the stone  he saw in his visit to what was then called Palestine. Additionally, in “Jésus dans la synagogue” an elegantly and expensively  garbed Jesus stands at the bima surrounded by seated priests, richly attired  in luxurious dress, as is suggested by the yellow gowns and lace edged draped  shawls, who seem indifferent to what he is doing. What is particularly inter- esting is that in the same portfolio, Tissot paints the Publican’s garb the same  yellow (“Le pharisien et le publicain”). Again, this may well be representative  of what monks or priests or rich bourgeois of Tissot’s day were wearing. And  the loin covering, which falls behind his back as well as being elegantly draped  over his shoulder in “La Résurrection,” and the full garb in “Domine Non Sum  Dignus” in the same portfolio, suggests some degree of wealth and sophistica- tion as well as modernity. His followers, depicted as prostrate in the presence  of the resurrected Christ, are not depicted in the garb of the first century BCE,  but that of a far more modern time. It is only the Jewish ornamentation in our cover work that distinguishes  the setting from a cathedral. The bima might well be a church lectern, and  those surrounding him would be rightly placed in the chancel or an ornate side  chapel off the nave. But the ornamentation, when combined with Jesus’ tallit,  traditionally worn by Jews in public prayer, is sufficient to let the viewer know  that Tissot is depicting Jesus as a Jew. And, significantly, Jesus is distinguished  from the others not only insofar as he alone stands at the bima, but most im- portant, because he alone wears the tallit. The others are seated and appear to  be paying little attention to what is going on.  What is particularly unique in this work is not what is being depicted but  rather the artist’s methodology. Clearly the blending of two different styles,  the Neoclassical and Realist-Romantic, is significant and may not only reflect  Tissot’s training, but the work’s provenience (France, c. 1886 and 1894). Its  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="7">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 127 incorporation into the entire series, first exhibited in Paris in 1896, places  it within the parameters of both movements. However, his stay in the Holy  Land (1886–87), where there can be little doubt this series was painted, may  have influenced the light-infused nature of much, albeit not all of paintings,  thus leading to the perception of Romanticism despite his use of gouache.  Clearly Tissot’s birthplace, Nantes (Brittany) and his having studied with the  Neoclassical Ingres, the most well known of his teachers at Ecole des Beaux  Arts, would argue more for the Neoclassical influence than the Romantic.  However, his friendship with Manet, Degas, and Whistler, as well as his mys- tical experience at Saint-Sulpice and exposure to the art of Delacroix, may well  have influenced Tissot and led to the melding of two rather different styles. So  his incorporation of sharp and clean lines in a rather romantic work, a stylistic  combination Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres himself would have hardly ap- proved, is interesting. And the combination may well reflect his vision of a  Jewish Jesus who is also the Christian Christ. A Portrait of Gray    Steven Bowman  University of Cincinnati A picture is worth a thousand words A thousand years are in your eyes but a yesterday that has past The Book of Maccabees introduced two neologisms that have come to charac- terize a perennial western challenge: hellenismos and iudaismos. The first desig- nated Jews who were acculturating to Greek society in language and practice;  the second to the Torah-observant Jews who ultimately made war on these  reformers. After two millennia of commentary culminating in Matthew Ar- nold’s classic essay on Judaism and Hellenism, Abraham Joshua Heschel wrote  his paean to the Sabbath in which he defined in his own way Hellenism as a  space-dominated architecture and Judaism as a cathedral in time. Maimonides  had already in the twelfth century castigated any slippage toward “idolatry” by  the “faithful” in their monotheism by proposing his negative attributions to  the discussion of the Creator, e.g., Elohim is not not wise, not not powerful,  etc. Heschel’s metaphors come close to challenging that admonition. Editorial choice has uncovered from the bowels of French archives a pic- ture of Jesus that pays more attention to details than to the emotive charac- teristics of a backwoods preacher whose firebrands were tempered with love  in true prophetic tradition. Let me note that James Tissot is not my kind of  illustrator. His figures are less impressive than the accuracy of the detail with  which he fills his biblical pictures. They are a quiet fugue that is soporific rath-  Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="8"> 128 ♦ Zev Garber     er than stimulating; indeed they look like calendar illustrations. Rather I was  much more impressed with the paintings of Jean-Léon Gérôme who was on  exhibition at the Musée d’Orsay last Autumn and which can be still accessed  on the internet. Gérôme too was a kind of photographer in oils, but he was  suffused with an Orientalism that caught the light and color of the Antique  Lands that he visited. His sense of drama and the tensions portrayed in his  work resemble the skill of the poet who sang the Song of Deborah, in which  the heroines of that magnificent victory paean were caught at the moment,  the zenith, of their act sculpted in the pathos of the words and rhythm of the  song. Compared to his Orientalism, the bland [opaque watercolor] anachro- nism of a Jesus in sandals [sandals were de rigueur in Tissut’s NT oeuvre] in  a nineteenth-century Ashkenazi synagogue is too incongruous to be appreci- ated. Perhaps that is what the editor planned: to shock the observer. But in  that case why such a colorless portrayal which is in itself a betrayal of the  power of a revolutionary who taught and practiced iudaismos in his life and  death? Somehow I am reminded of the representation of Karl Marx, dressed  in nineteenth-century fashion and seated in the reading room of the British  Museum (perhaps substitute Eco’s mediaeval library), the quiet revolutionary  analyst of the vicissitudes of his time, and not the firebrand icon of a revolu- tion that destroyed a civilization. The aniconic tradition of Islam that prohibits depiction of Muhammed  and Allah, save in the cartoon style of Shi’ites drawn most likely from Hindu  influences, has led to bloodshed and terror from the Black Muslim occupation  of the B’nai B’rith building in Washington, D.C. during the period of the film  on Muhammed some years ago. More recently the debacle of the bad taste  cartoons about Muhammed and Islam rocked Denmark at the instigation, as  we now know, of Syria, which apparently orchestrated the riots. Did Jews ever  riot or protest or kill Christians for their reification in paint and stone of their  homo-theos? They would have been wiped out by the dominant Christians!  Did Jews ever depict Jesus visually other than in the non-anthropomorphic  style of Marc Chagall? The painting of the Crucifixion, the subject of the semi- autobiographical novel My Name is Asher Lev by Chaim Potok, reflects the  discussion in his Brooklyn environment. Potok, an artist in paint as well as  in pen, also painted his own “Brooklyn Crucifixion.” (Is it a coincidence that  Tissot’s watercolor is now located in the Brooklyn Museum?) Jews too, at least  those who follow iudaismos, even if somewhat more secularized than their  ancestors, are basically aniconic in religious art, as opposed to the Latin and  Greek Christians who treat their Jesus in the tradition of hellenismos, i.e., like  an ancient god who had to be visually represented. And those representations,  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="9">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 129 called icons, have their own sanctity that even Augustine’s claim that they were  merely didactic tools could not overcome.  My own essay briefly looks at the challenge and response of Jews to the  different readings of Bible by Byzantine Christians and Jews. This was in an  environment where Christian visual images predominated. There are no tradi- tions among Byzantine Jews that denigrate such pictorial representations of  the Christian god and his [mainly Jewish] saints. On the contrary, the tenth- century Book of Yosippon is keen to describe the ancient and Byzantine cus- tom of weaving portraits on tapestry and tunic. And perhaps some of these  may even have been woven by skilled Jewish fingers, as in recent times Jews in  Havana controlled the manufacture and sale of Christian souvenirs. So why adorn this revolutionary book about Jesus with a somewhat faded  photographic picture that shocks, or at least disturbs, the observer with its  incongruities? Perhaps it is meant, like the Maven’s drashot, to challenge one’s  reality in true pilpulistic fashion, much as Chagall’s Crucifixion did in its time.  In any case art is in the eye of the beholder, so let the book not be ill defined  by its cover—and may the reader enjoy the revolution in word within which is  the true key to iudaismos.  What’s Yusseleh Doing in a Shul? Norman Simms  University of Waikato, New Zealand The cover of the Shofar supplement on “The Jewish Jesus” immediately raises  three different but related kinds of questions. The first has to do with the ap- propriateness, historical and moral, of placing an image of the Christian Sav- ior in a Jewish setting. The second asks: Does that supposedly realistic picture  that shows first century CE Jews in worship accurately represent synagogues  of the pre-Talmudic period? The third question lurks inside these two first  ones: Is this an apt illustration for the articles contained within the scholarly  collection of essays?  Assuming for the sake of argument that the young man with a reddish  beard draped in his tallit gadol standing on the Sephardic bima and in front  of the still wrapped Ashekenazi Torah scrolls is meant to be Jesus of Naza- reth, this picture does fairly fit the unprovable contention that the histori- cal Jesus was a Jew who knew and took part in such ritual occasions. There  would seem to be nothing exceptional in his situation, despite anomalies in the  painterly details, if we had no other information about Jesus’ preaching career  and eventual arrest and crucifixion or of his transformation within Christian  myth into a Savior God. In fact, the illustration works best when no critical   Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="10"> 130 ♦ Zev Garber     gaze is directed at the details and none of the aspects in the second question  are asked. Any counter-arguments about Jesus being merely an ahistorical po- lemical construct created after the separating out of different forms of deviant,  reform, or completely outsider (e.g., Hellenistic Cynics or Johannine Baptists)  Jewish groups finds no echoes here.  But ask the right questions and, well, the whole idea of a synagogue in the  first century that looked like this seems terribly wrong. The painting shows  a romanticized (or to use the dreadful word: Orientalist) tendency to recast  a East European, and probably a fairly modern model, into a supposedly an- cient Middle Eastern mode. But that is not the worst of the problems. Israel  and Jerusalem, especially under the Hasmoneans, became, and then with the  Herodian government began to look like, a typical Hellenistic place—gyma- nisia, hippodromes, pagan temples, swimming baths, theatres, and other royal  and public buildings. A synagogue, as its name implies—and as it is rendered  in Hebrew terms bet knesset (house of assembly) or bet ha-sefer (house of the  book), was a community centre, law court, welfare agency, primary and sec- ondary school, local government office block, gentlemen’s debating club, etc.   In focusing on this cover picture, however, we see that not only are the  scrolls of the Law not open for reading, but also none of the old men (where  are the young men and children?) seated around this supposed Jesus-figure are  holding books (small scrolls or possibly codices) in their hands, whether open  for public reading or closed while they concentrate on what might be a sermon  in progress. Probably a more accurate painting would have shown these men  seated around a table reading, discussing, and arguing about the text of the  Law. None of these depicted gentlemen look very happy or even interested in  what is being said. My own reaction, the more I look at the picture, is to doubt  whether this was painted by anyone familiar with relatively modern rabbinical  customs and practices, let alone anyone familiar with the history of synagogue  architecture and ceremonials during the time when the Second Temple was  still functioning. Rabbinical Judaism based on interpretations of the Mishna,  Midrash, and Talmud, of course, lies hundreds of years in the future of the pu- tative moment in Christian history. If Jesus were a real person who occasional- ly entered very early synagogues, the surroundings would look more like what  we know, for example from archaeological digs at Bet-Alpha or from first and  second tomb ornaments at Talpiot. There is no evidence that citizens in the  Land of Israel would have dressed like anything but contemporary Romans or  Greeks—not exotic quasi-Assyrian or (more anachronistically Arabic) elders.  Perhaps they might have been wearing tfillin, which was more a daily marker  of Judaism than later head-coverings until way past Antiquity. Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="11">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 131 Thus I take this cover picture as an appropriate depiction of the kind of  Christian distortions that have always misunderstood Judaism in all periods  of history. Unlike the Chagall paintings that appropriate Christian images of  Jesus’ pains and humiliations, wanderings through the world, and charismatic  displays of magic, this painting exposes the very kinds of problems the ar- ticles in the collection address. As in any traditional rabbinic learning session,  machloqet, the goal is not to state the truth but to set the mind working to- wards truth, and truth comes through endless questions and challenges as a  dynamic and ever-developing phenomenon. Millennial Anachronism Eugene J. Fisher,  Retired From U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  My initial impression of the cover picture for this book, which I consider one  of great importance in which I am honored to be included, was that this seems  to me a rather odd picture to put on the cover of a book that has only been pos- sible in modern, post-Shoah times. It is a medieval portrait, though positive,  of Jesus reading Torah in a synagogue, sandals and all, evocative more of the  bad old days of Christian triumphalism and intermittent, albeit real, tolerance  of Jews, than the spirit of contemporary dialogue. One could choose a picture  showing Jesus as a first-century Judean, or one of a present-day dialogue (e.g.,  John Paul II embracing the chief rabbi of Rome), but not something in be- tween. The art is good and the message conveyed the same as that of the book.  Jesus the Nazarene is best understood not through the eyes of later, Patristic  and scholastic Christian theology, much less modern Christian fundamental- ism, but through the lens of the early first-century Jewish reality in which he  was born, lived, and died at the hands of the Romans and their quislings, the  chief priests of the temple who were appointed by and beholden to Rome.  But why then, I asked, is the picture not accurate to the dress and the  synagogue realities of the first century, as best as we know them? Why dress  Jesus and his fellow Jewish worshippers in garments they would not wear for  centuries? The subliminal message of the cover art is good. But why the mil- lennial anachronism? Likewise, the picture evokes what would today be considered Orthodox  Judaism. This is fine by me, since most Christians do not distinguish between  Orthodox, Reform, Conservative and Reconstructionist Judaism. But it might  legitimately be questioned as representative of the contemporary, especially  American Jewish community represented in this volume of essays. So there is  an internal Jewish issue here, it would seem to this Christian observer, as well   Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="12"> 132 ♦ Zev Garber     as a lack of illustrating what the book is about: largely the re-evaluation of  Jesus by his fellow Jews in our time (Nostra Aetate), not in medieval times.  It is not, however, as bad as the covers presented to me for my book Semi- nary Education and Christian-Jewish Relations. They first sent me a star of Da- vid superimposed (= crucified) on a cross. I told them to use a menorah and  a fish (ichthus), the cross being a negative symbol to Jews. So they did: a fish  being barbecued over a lighted menorah. The third try worked: a fish crowned,  as it were, by a menorah. The cover is important in this as in any book. The  book is not just about Jesus. It is about Jewish and Christian understand- ings of Jesus the Jew. The cover therefore should reflect something more than  the simple (at least now, in the aftermath of a great deal of scholarship and  dialogue and official Protestant and Catholic Church statements) reality that  Jesus was a Jew. Maybe something from Chagall. This said, I need also to note that the best is often the enemy of the good.  There may not exist the perfect art piece at this point in time to convey in an  image the various strands of historical and theological dialogue, representing  the distillation and renewal of relations between the peoples of God of Abra- ham and Sarah, that this volume brings together. What is taking place now in  Jewish-Christian dialogue has never occurred before, and had not occurred  in the time of Chagall. It is entirely unprecedented, certainly in the history of  Western civilization and arguably in human history. And this new relation- ship, this dialogue between ancient faiths remembering their history for the  sake of the future, is still, as Cardinal Walter Kasper, the immediate past presi- dent of the Holy See’s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews, said  more than once, only at the beginning of the beginning. So the evocation of a  French artist of Jesus reading the Torah in a medieval synagogue may well be  the best cover that is, today, possible. And so I laud those responsible for it. I do have one final caveat, though. If one looks carefully at the picture,  two of the three Jews seated behind Jesus to his right are clearly and nastily  scowling. The third, closest to Jesus, may be seen as scowling too. Editing the  cover picture, I believe, is very much in order, given the tragic history and con- sequences of the collective guilt charge against Jews and Judaism for the death  of Jesus.  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="13">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 133 Jesus at Nazareth’s Synagogue: An Anti-Jewish  Anachronism Michael J. Cook  Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion  Cincinnati  While a “Jewish” Jesus expounding Scripture in synagogue seems appealing,  academically the story’s associations are discomfiting at least to me: Anti-Jewish Context. Jewish readers who rally to Luke’s unique stories of  Jesus’ (and Paul’s) Jewish observances may not recognize that Luke crafts these  to serve anti-Jewish ends. Only Luke, among the Gospel writers, highlights  Jesus’ circumcision (2:21), redemption of the first-born ceremony (2:22,27),  youthful confounding of Temple sages (2:41ff.), and daily teaching in the  Temple (19:47; 20:1; 21:37). Our scene, Jesus’ reading and interpreting Scrip- ture in Nazareth’s synagogue (4:16–30), also uniquely Lukan, partakes of this  larger tapestry that Luke extends likewise to Paul in the book of Acts. Here,  deliberately contradicting Paul’s Epistles, Luke transforms Paul from a Dias- pora Greek Jew into a proto-rabbinic Jew with Jerusalem upbringing (Acts  22:3; 26:4ff.); casts Paul as a disciple of Gamaliel, the premier Pharisee (Acts  22:3); accords Paul both a Hebrew name, Saul (13:9), and facility in Hebrew  language (21:40; 22:2); and even depicts Paul accommodating the Law (16:3  [cf. Gal 2:3]; 21:20ff.; 25:8)—all fictions. The fiction of our painting must be  seen as part of this same complex. But how are these makeshift motifs anti-Jewish—with the theme of  our painting chief among them? The overwhelmingly Gentile demography  of Christianity by the 90s C.E. poses for Luke, himself Gentile, a dire co- nundrum: how to explain why a movement that should have succeeded  overwhelmingly with Jews instead failed miserably to maintain the expected  complexion. His answers are (1) that Jews rejecting Jesus—beginning with our  Nazareth episode—thereby orphaned themselves from their own legacy; and  (2) that what effectively authenticated Gentile-Christians as replacing true  “Jews” was that their founders, Jesus and Paul, displayed super-Jewish religi- osity. This is classic “displacement theology”: metaphorically, were Judaism a  train, Jews mistakenly got off when they rejected Jesus at Nazareth’s synagogue,  thereby opening the way for the now “chosen” Gentile-Christians to board in  their stead as the true Jews.

[is] the most devastating and . . . destructive of Ju- daism in all . . . New Testament documents.” And Luke’s foremost “window- dressing” is the episode on our cover. Anti-Jewish Exposition. Those resting content only with the idyllic  opening of our scene may not consider that standard Gospel scholarship looks  to later verses of Gospel episodes to reveal the genuinely intended meaning  as a whole. Our episode’s core message is thus not at all the opening scene  displayed, 4:16–23, but verses 24–27: God’s preference for Gentiles (citing  1 Kings 17:8–9 and 2 Kings 5:14). Indeed, hearing the latter is what alleg- edly catalyzes our ancestors to try propelling Jesus over a cliff, an impending  horrendous image our cover neglects to intimate! Luke’s—but hardly Jesus’— message: Jews in Nazareth symbolize all Jews who rejected Jesus, an opening  salvo culminating in Luke’s key final declaration ending Acts (28:25ff.): “This  people [the Jews] . . . shall . . . never understand . . . never perceive.” Reinforce- ments punctuate the way: whether by the Lukan Jesus (“none of those men . . .  invited [= the Jews] shall taste my banquet” [Luke 14:24]); or by the Lukan  Paul (“since you [ Jews] . . . judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold,  we turn to the Gentiles” [Acts 13:46]; also “your blood be upon your heads! . . .  From now on I will go to the Gentiles” [18:5b–6]).  Anachronistic Practice. I thank my Hebrew Union College colleagues  Lawrence Hoffman and Richard Sarason, who confirm my contention that we  have no evidence for the liturgical practice of Haftarah readings of the Proph- ets until possibly Luke’s own time—at least six decades later than Jesus’ min- istry.3 It is from Mark 6:1–6 that Luke appropriates Jesus’ visit to Nazareth,4  expanding it by selecting a scripture reading for which Luke devises his own  anti-Jewish exposition—inventing speeches was standard practice by Greek  writers: Herodotus, Thucydides, 2 Maccabees, Josephus, etc. Our cover’s  painting is thus a fictional anachronism reflecting not at all Jesus the Jew (ca.  30 C.E.) but solely Luke the Gentile (ca. 95–125 C.E.). Concretizing this anomaly is Luke’s proof-texting: buttressing Gentile- Christian theology by recourse to Jewish biblical texts—here Isaiah 61:1–2;  2Although I would phrase it “destructive of Jews” (since for Luke authentic Judaism is  what survived as Christianity) (Norman Beck, Mature Christianity in the 21st Century [New  York: Crossroad, 1994], p. 207). 3Even Acts 13:15 need not be credible. 4But out of sequence, because Luke is bent on shifting the visit far earlier in Jesus’  Galilean ministry.

No wonder that Jewish tradition appears to have deliberately ex- cluded this Isaiah text from later Haftarah cycles but, soberly, not passages  surrounding it!5 Since Luke’s aim is to expose Jews as blind to meanings of  their own Scriptures, again our cover leads not to the Jewish Jesus but to the  Gentile Luke. Thematic Discord. The essay I contributed to our volume—“How Cred- ible Is Jewish Scholarship on Jesus?”—counters our cover, since I include mis- construing Luke’s theological aim among the nine Gospel themes where I aver  that Jewish scholarship is weak.6  The great American rabbi, Stephen S. Wise, asserted that Jews should  know “that Jesus was a Jew of the Jews. . . . And . . . if he were to dwell among  men today, he would find a place in the modern synagogue.”7 Wise’s hyperbole  aside, the image of Jesus in modern synagogues is to me more felicitous than  Luke’s image of him in Nazareth—an episode flashing multiple caution-sig- nals that we overlook when embracing this painting for our cover. You May Judge This Book by Its Cover Penny Wheeler  Los Angeles Valley College For centuries the typical Christian layperson would have regarded Jesus not  only as the wellspring of eternal life, the very embodiment of the church, but  the archetypal Christian as well. It has taken an evil as monstrous as the Shoah  to reorient Christian thought to confront the obvious: that Jesus was not only  a full-fledged member of the peoplehood by virtue of his ancestry, but also an  observant Jew well-steeped in Torah. The Catholic Church has been taking  pains to emphasize Jesus’ Jewish nature for decades now. The Jewishness of  Jesus permeates the religious instructional programs throughout the levels of  catechism for Catholic youth. Homilies during the Mass have driven home  the same message to the faithful week after week. It is probably safe to say that  Roman Catholic Christians of the early 21st century are very familiar with the  concept of the Jewish Jesus. They are comfortable with the concept, and have  5Chapters 60, end of 61, and 62–63 are represented in Haftarah cycles. 6The others: Jesus’ Last Supper, Sanhedrin trial, “blasphemy” verdict, pairing with  Barabbas, Jewish opponents, partiality for the “lost sheep . . . of Israel,” Passion-week outline,  and intent to “fulfill” the Law. 7Wise, Shall Jesus of Nazareth Be Taught in the Jewish Sabbath School?

Many Roman Catholics feel that co-religionist Mel Gibson’s onscreen  tribute to Jesus of Nazareth did not go nearly far enough in portraying his  Jewishness. While Gibson’s depiction of the child asking in innocent won- derment, “Why is this night unlike any other night?” is certainly charming, it  nonetheless emphasizes the coming arrest of Jesus rather than the four ques- tions associated with the Jewish Passover Seder. Mel Gibson’s Jesus is con- ceptually Jewish without actually being “a Jew,” if that is possible. Rather than  being an observant Jew, Gibson’s Jesus of Nazareth comes across more as a  proto-Christian with a Jewish Mother. Enter Professor Zev Garber, whose historiosophy recognizes the vital  importance to Christianity of a Jesus who is unabashedly Jewish. For Garber,  Jesus’ Jewishness constitutes a central unifying element in Jewish-Christian re- lations. The cover art of Professor Garber’s latest publication, The Jewish Jesus,  portrays the second person of the Christian Trinity in a manner in which he  has never been depicted before. On the cover of Zev Garber’s volume, we see  Jesus the observant Jew reading Torah in the synagogue. From the immediate  reaction to the cover art, it became abundantly clear that the concept of “the  Jewish Jesus” is one thing, but the portrayal of “Jesus the Jew” is quite another.  It is easy enough for people to embrace a concept, but a graphic depiction such  as this proves far more difficult to swallow. Never have we seen a representation of Jesus quite like this. With his  head covered by a prayer shawl, he appears to be so Jewish that some fear the  “Jesus” aspect has been lost. The crown of thorns may indeed have been a sign  of opprobrium, but it was a crown nonetheless. Its ownership depended upon  the ability to bear the heaviness of the cross to its bitter culmination. The  prayer shawl, however, indicates obedience. Its wearer is not a crucified king,  but rather an observant Jew totally absorbed in his usual devotional practices,  peering intently at a scroll illuminated by many candles. Christians can hardly recognize Jesus in this light. Christians often picture  him in nature, ensconced near the apex of a hill overlooking his throngs of fol- lowers. In the synoptic gospels, Jesus’ first mountainside sermon is recounted  as if to remind us that his Father was indeed the Lord of Creation. It is almost  as though the Jesus worshipped by Christians never took part in organized  liturgical practices within the confines of any sort of man-made structure, ex- cept perhaps during the Last Supper. This strange disconnect may be traced  to those who penned the gospel accounts of Jesus of Nazareth. Such an author  would be far more likely to recount the unusual than the commonplace. Thus  the gospel writers recount in detail the criticism of the Pharisees. They quote  Shofar  ♦  An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies </page> <page sequence="17">  That Jesus Cover ♦ 137 at great length from the hilltop sermons and describe details of the miracles.  However, what they do not describe is perhaps more significant, namely, the  customary devotional practices of typically observant Jews. Accounts such as  these would be too humdrum to mention, a waste of precious writing materi- als. The synoptic gospels mention synagogue attendance, but only in passing.  St. Luke’s gospel says that Jesus “as his custom was . . . went into the synagogue  on the Sabbath day, and stood up . . . to read” (Luke 4:16). St. Matthew’s gospel  tells us that Jesus “went about all Galilee, teaching in . . . synagogues” (Matthew  4:23). St. Mark’s gospel concurs on the synagogue attendance, but says that  Jesus “preached” there (Mark 1:39). What the gospels tell us is that Jesus was  an observant Jew. According to St. John’s gospel people called him “rabbi.” He  frequented the synagogue. On any given Sabbath the synagogue is where Jesus  was to be found. Yet Christians find the portrayal of their Lord frequenting  an explicitly non-Christian house of worship to be quite unsettling. It is one  thing to hear such a practice mentioned in passing in the gospels; but to be- hold a graphic representation such as the one found on the front cover of Zev  Garber’s latest volume . . . is frankly quite shocking to many Christians. Christians fail to recognize their Lord in the artist’s rendering of the Jew- ish Jesus, but Jews recognize only too well the house of worship in which Jesus  has been portrayed. They, too, are aghast. The synagogue pictured by the artist  is distinctly Ashkenazic. How would that be possible? Jesus is reading from a  Torah that is distinctly Sephardic in style. How would that be possible? How  indeed? The cover art for Professor Garber’s Jewish Jesus volume opens a door  that has been firmly nailed shut for centuries. If the artist had somehow man- aged an authentic reproduction of a Judaean house of worship, how would we  know? What makes us so sure that anyone would be able to recognize it as a  synagogue? But a glance at the cover of The Jewish Jesus makes it abundantly  clear. It screams “Synagogue!” There is no doubt. It cannot be a Coptic church  or a temple of Mithra. It is clearly a synagogue, recognizable because our ex- perience has given us certain notions of what a synagogue should look like.  The Diaspora certainly did an ethnic number on the liturgical practices of  the Jews, as did the “westernization” of Ashkenazic Judaism in the nineteenth  century. The former spawned a plethora of Judaisms all over the world. The  latter did the same in America, including an ethnic orthodox blessing noticed  by a young Leonard Nimoy. He later appropriated it as the sign of the Vulcan  benediction, “Live long and prosper!” Indeed, the plethora of Judaisms paral- lel the multitude of Christianities—ethnic and otherwise—that also flourish  here in the land of opportunity.  The question is, would the Jesus that Christians worship recoil at the no- tion of entering an Ashkenazic synagogue, or of reading from a Sephardic   Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> <page sequence="18"> 138 ♦ Zev Garber     Torah? Would he cringe at the Hebrew pronunciation coming from a fourth- rate Polish rabbi, or at the syllables sung by a Brazilian cantor? I think not,  any more than he would have hesitated to cover his head or put on sandals  upon entering a house of worship. The synagogue in the picture reflects such  an array of chronologies and ethnic traditions. Perhaps it takes precisely such  a painting to summon Christians and Jews back in from the parochial fringes  to rediscover the central core of their faith. Forget the old adage about judging  a book by its cover. Both the cover and the articles inside should prompt soul- searching and a lively exchange of ideas. In the selection of his book’s cover  art, Professor Garber attempts “to boldly go where no man has gone before.”  May this volume spark intellectual controversies that will indeed live long and  prosper!   Maven Talk: Under the Cover Zev Garber  Los Angeles Valley College Steve Jacobs’s use of the Talmudic directive, machloqet l’shem shamayim, Nor- man Simms (a Brooklyn native) referencing Jesus as “Yusseleh” (little Joseph),  and Steve Bowman making the point that the Tissot painting hangs in Brook- lyn prompt this aphorism from my Eastern European background. The Baker  and the Butcher argued about this, that, everything. They seem to agree to  never agree. Butcher said “Yes,” Baker said “No.” Baker said, “Day,” the Butcher  said “Night.” So it was decreed that the belligerents present their arguments  before the community Rabbi. When the Baker presented his case, the Rabbi  responded. “You are right.” Then the Butcher argued forcibly his case, and the  Rabbi responded, “You are right.” The Rabbi’s wife seeing and hearing all, re- peated the opposing replies of the Butcher and the Baker and said to the Rab- bi, “How is this possible that they are both acceptable?” The Rabbi thought a  Sinai moment, and replied: “You are right, too!” Steve ( Jacobs), you are right, different strokes for different folks and dis- agreements here are a family feud, not attack and counterattack. Sara, you  are right in assessing the artist as an artist and not as a biblical exegete. Steve  (Bowman), you are right, scholarship is better served with a portrait of a patri- otic Judean Jesus rather than a romanticized synagogue Jesus.

Factuality and Actuality. By the former, I mean supposed “facts” as  “facts”; by the latter, I mean supposed “facts” as perceived and practiced by the  perceiver. The Jesus book cover, the Lukan verses, and the Sitz im Leben of the  people then and now call for a rabbinic darshani (“interpret me”). The artist is  a creative talent whose imagination sees Jesus praying, reading, or preaching in  a Synagogue or Temple influenced by a mixture of Sephardic and Ashkenazi  traditions in a French milieu. The dress, the Torah scroll, and Synagogue inte- rior are factually inaccurate to the Judaism of the Second Temple period, but  they are actually riveting. Irony of ironies. I am the one in this collection of erudite chapters who  toots Jesus as a loyalist Jewish nationalist zealous for Jewish sovereignty. Run- ning through my Jesus imagination are the metei midbar of yesteryear—Joseph  Klausner, Sholem Ash, Uri Zvi Greenberg, S.G.F. Brandon—and yet I oppose  Jesus-as-Judah messiah on the cover. In the spirit of Shabbat Channuka, “not  by power nor might but My spirit saith the Lord of hosts” (Zech 4:6). The  Zealot Messiah is clothed in a TaRYaG Garment, and isn’t that what the title  reads: The Jewish Jesus, Revelation, the rest is commentary and tradition. Factually speaking, I suggested the Chagall Crucifixion (copied in previ- ous mailings to the contributors) as the cover. I was told that the expense to  use was beyond budget. Free public access was suggested. I looked and looked  and was not satisfied. In the dog days of August 2010, however, I stumbled  upon the Brooklyn Museum Jesus exhibit.

Scholars Profess But It Ain’t Necessarily So. “Don’t judge a book by its  cover” is my gut reaction to the Jesus scholars who will reject or question seri- ous scholarship in this volume based on an artist’s vision. Not giving a look in  the book speaks volumes about the professing scholar. Professors profess and  teachers teach. I am a teacher in the tradition of Mosheh Rabbeinu.

Not one objected to the cover. Rather, I heard, “inviting,” “engrossing,” “wel- coming.” A college sampling of ethnics, Catholics, other Christians, and Jews,  has spoken positively, not negatively, about the cover. Is that not what the book  blurb states—to discover and rediscover Jesus in the setting of Judaism? Blast From the Past. The Brooklyn priest called my home multiple times  that Friday afternoon to speak with me. He succeeded in reaching me on his  third attempt before the Sabbath descended. He asked if I was a Catholic  Jew, as told to him by someone at Seton Hall. “No,” I said nor “am I a Jewish  Catholic.” I am not sure if the priest was convinced, since he proceeded to ask  if I would condone a Catholic-Jewish marriage. He was asking because the  nephew of his parishioner was deeply involved with the daughter of an Ortho- dox rabbi from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. I said, “No,” explaining  that the Orthodox halakhic stance against interfaith marriage made virtually  impossible that a Chasidic Rabbi, father of the bride, could conduct the cer- emony with a Roman Catholic priest. The priest persisted and insisted that he  would cross over to Jewish sensitivity to ease things. I said that nothing, abso- lutely nothing that he as a sacramental priest can do, will convert these trouble  waters into wine. I finally shut him down by saying that the potential children  from the Jewish woman of the union will be deemed halakhicly Jewish. Period.  “I guess I should advise against this union?” “Yes, Father, yes,” said I, hoping  to end the call as I simultaneously watched my wife light the Shabbat candles.  Alas, the Father had one more question, “Professor, what do you say about our  Lord Jesus Christ?” I did not hang up. I did not scream. I commanded, “Sit  down, Father, you are in God’s repose now, let me tell you about Jesus the Jew.”  Setting Jesus in shul is not a bad start. That Jesus Cover. Steven Jacobs asks whimsically if a book’s cover can  capture its content. Steve Bowman muses that the gray picture is worthy of a  thousand words (and proceeds to write a thousand words). Whereas Norman  Simms sees a standing Jesus in misconstrued synagogue architecture and fur- niture, and Gene Fisher sees scowling Jews at the bima, Michael Cook sculp- tures a propaganda-laced scriptural attack on the legitimacy of “Old” Israel  and Penny Wheeler on the scholarship of Zev Garber, Western/Midwestern Jewish Stud- ies Association (University of Denver, April 2009) Shofar 28.1 (Fall 2009): 132–142; and  Joel Gereboff, Roberta Sabbath, Steve Jacobs, Leonard Greenspoon, Emily Leah Silverman,  Zev Garber, “A Symposium on the Work of Zev Garber; Reviews of Maven in Blue Jeans,”  Hebrew Studies 51 (2010): 351–383.

Yet Penny Wheeler reasons that the portrayal of “Jesus  the Jew” is properly presented on the book cover. And Sara Mandell sees in the  fringeless shawls on the attendees a clear sign that Tissot’s Jesus is participat- ing in a priestly Temple rite and not a Synagogue ritual.   My colleagues are engaged in eisegesis and deconstruction, glued by in- terpretation. So is the Maven, but I reconstruct surrealistically. The “scowling”  Jews are in the state of mortem, which explains the fringeless prayer shawls,  now a burial garment. In contrast, Ecce Homo, enwrapped in the fringed gar- ment, a dynamic symbol of living Judaism, reads from the eternal Torah—a  scene from the yeshiva shel ma`alah (Heavenly Academy), which plays on  Earth as a reminder to Jews to do Judaism. On the other hand, may the Hang- ing Jesus in the Brooklyn Museum, in the borough of churches, be seen in hues  of Christology—postmortem Judaism replaced by the Resurrected Christ  reading and fulfilling the Torah. Indeed, the three bars on the prayer shawl of  Jesus suggests the Trinity—if four bars, the letters shni and yud, “gift”—and  is this not sanctioned by the Jew on the balcony ( Father God) who sees and  approves.  In sum, that Jesus cover seethes in conflict and controversy. Good. Experi- ence the interpretation.  Vol. 30, No. 3   ♦   2012 </page> </plain_text>
