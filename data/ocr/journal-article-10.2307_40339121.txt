<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTRODUCTION BEYOND NATURE /CULTURE DUALISM: LETS TRY CO-EVOLUTION INSTEAD OF "CONTROL" RONNIE HAWKINS In the original call for papers for this special issue, nature/culture dualism was characterized as a way of thinking that holds human culture and nonhuman nature to be radically different ontological spheres, hyper- separated and oppositional, or, as Val Plumwood maintains in her essay, an orientation that assumes "separate casts of characters in separate dra- mas." In the human sphere, individuals are unique and their lives are precious (at least theoretically), with concerns understood "from the inside," in terms of experience, intention and agency. In the sphere of nature, on the other hand, nonhuman beings are seen "from the outside," at best as replaceable members of species or populations needed for ecosystem functioning and, at worst, as unagentive, thinglike objects open for unbridled human exploitation. With our vast information and com- munication systems now largely in place, however, our human "noosphere" is rapidly enlarging to place us firmly within the biosphere (which, of course, in the imagery of Venn diagrams, must make up the larger circle on the screen), illuminating "both casts in both dramas," or perhaps joining all actors on the stage in a many-act, multidimensional play, the denoument of which, whether or not the extant lifeforms on this ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 11(2) 2006 ISSN: 1085-6633 Â©Indiana University Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

The five essays in this collection speak to these points, and together they develop an alter- native vision to our present dualistic impasse, seeing multiple natural agencies engaged with humanity in ongoing co-evolution and, as Freya Mathews suggests, raising the hope for a synergistic restructuring of life- ways that may yet save us from anthropogenic catastrophe. In "The Culture of Nature As Seen Through Mississippian Geogra- phies," Jeff Baldwin shows us the broad scope of interacting agents, human and nonhuman, biological and geological, in what he terms "the nature-culture of the Mississippi River," as highlighted by the recent dev- astation of human habitation along the Gulf Coast of the United States wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. By enacting a role in which we "believe [our] selves to rule over a mechanistic world," we humans have, over the last century or so, stemmed the natural flooding of the Missis- sippi, rerouting the sediments that maintained and extended the delta, funneling them into the sea and thereby bringing about the subsidence and erosion of hundreds of square miles of coastal land. Concomitantly, we have let agricultural runoff from the huge Mississippi drainage basin eject excess nutrients into the Gulf of Mexico, stimulating algal blooms and die-offs, depleting the water of oxygen so as to create a hypoxic "dead zone" that is now the size of Massachusetts, and (though Baldwin does not discuss this aspect of the problem) we have released enough petrochemical pollution in the area to have earned the lower reaches of the River the name "Cancer Alley" decades ago. A failure to grasp the import of these large anthropogenic effects is, sadly, evident in calls for rebuilding the New Orleans area according to the same mechanistic model that has already proven so inadequate. Baldwin observes that the earth changes wrought through human cultural innovation often occur so rapidly, or have their negative feedbacks technologically so displaced through time and space, that their eventual impacts on the larger system may initially go unappreciated. His vision of "the culture of nature," how- ever, is ultimately an optimistic one, since his functional understanding of culture is that it ultimately works toward mutualism, promoting increas- ingly appropriate relationships among all interacting components, and he finds evidence of a growing effort to establish an "intentional co-evolu- tion," a conscious alignment of human projects with the ongoing projects of a living nature that encompasses them. 2 ETHICS &amp;THE ENVIRONMENT, 11(2) 2006</page><page sequence="3">If Baldwin's essay helps us see our human activities "from the out- side" - not just "from within" prevailing human culture, where they seem taken-for-granted necessities given a certain form of social construction, but as they alternatively appear inside biospherical space, often as inap- propriate, exploitative interferences and intrusions - Stacey Sowards' essay, "Identification Through Orangutans: Destabilizing the Nature/Cul- ture Dualism," explores the potential for our connecting with nonhuman life "from the inside," relating to individual nonhumans, at least members of cognitively developed species not too dissimilar from our own, as char- acters in the cultural drama we are most familiar with. Sowards approaches her topic from the standpoint of rhetoric, examining the ways in which humans may come to identify with orangutans, a species she encountered on her travels in Southeast Asia. Utilizing the identification theory of Kenneth Burke and others, she points out how those who wish to protect orangutans and their rainforest habitat employ such rhetorical strategies as demonstrating consubstantiality, the idea that one "shares substance" with another, in this case literally (in the form of shared DNA and common mental processes) and figuratively (through common origin stories for humans and orangutans), and presenting perspective by incon- gruity, such as juxtaposing human and orangutan infants in stories and images. Sowards cautions that, while our identification with these intelli- gent red apes may help us overcome our dualistic patterns of thought, we must remain cognizant of our differences as well, and she endorses Frans de Waal's notion of "animalcentric anthropomorphism" as the proper approach to take, attempting to understand what things are like from the animal's - rather than a projected human's - point of view. The third and fourth essays in this collection, Anne Elvey's "Beyond Culture? Nature/Culture Dualism and the Christian Otherworldly" and Freya Mathews' "Beyond Modernity and Tradition: A Third Way for Development" plunge us into some deeper metaphysical waters. Elvey examines the ways in which "the Christian otherworldly" has often been construed in dualistic terms, as a realm outside the material universe, hyperseparated from it, superior to it, and, in the worst-case scenario, a world beyond whose arrival is to be eagerly anticipated with the coming apocalypse of the one immediately before us. While acknowledging the problematic dimensions of this aspect of Christian belief, however, Elvey wishes to retain "the Christian otherworldly" employed as a counter- RONN1E HAWKINS INTRODUCTION 3</page><page sequence="4">dualism, construed along the lines of Catherine Keller's "counter- apoca- lypse," an alternative way of conceiving reality that can enrich our appreciation of the otherness of nature. Taking "the otherworldly" to mean something other than the culturally constructed "world," she cri- tiques skepticism about the existence of the otherworldly in parallel with Plumwood's critique of nature-skepticism; belief in the otherworldly opens us to the possibility that "the world of human being, knowing, act- ing, and ends is not exhaustive." Elvey considers several possible relationships between nature and the otherworldly, including that nature itself is otherworldly. She invokes the idea of "a material transcendence" such that nature is not solely immanent, fully knowable by us, and may possess agency and ends of its own. Among the ethical implications she draws is a re-visioning of human mortality as a conscious choice to live (and die) within the limits of the earth. Mathews makes the bold claim that the way we understand our world - what she calls "our metaphysical premise" - is largely determi- nant of how we treat it, and that this fundamental orientation will be expressed throughout our culture. She recognizes three types of societies, traditional ones adhering to a pre-materialist metaphysics, encoded in religious texts and controlled by authority figures who interpret and impose them on the general populace; modern societies, whose meta- physics is materialism; and prospective or future societies that will have a connection to the sacred without the intervention of externally imposed authority and whose metaphysical premise, she predicts, will be post- materialism. Mathews defines materialism as an ontological position holding that "matter" is all there is to reality and that matter itself is "lacking any inner principle," devoid of all "meanings, purposes, values and communicative capacities." She claims that this materialist premise entails an instrumental modality which colors all of our "modern" cul- ture, leading us to view everything in the universe as merely a means to our own human ends - a stance often referred to as the product of "instrumental" or even "scientific" reason, aimed at uncovering causal relations within nature for purposes of controlling them. Now, I find the need to stop at this point of her analysis and point out the glaring inadequacy of "the materialist premise," as so defined, and the illogic behind the supposed entailment. If "matter" is "all there is" in the universe, and that matter is "sheer externality," lacking in any "inner" 4 ETHICS &amp;THE ENVIRONMENT, 11(2) 2006</page><page sequence="5">subjectivity, life, will, or agency, then we humans are faced with a serious metaphysical problem: we cannot account for ourselves within our own conceptual scheme. My thinking processes come to a full stop here - this cannot be an adequate metaphysics. Materialists must be smuggling in some kind of Cartesian dualism, imagining themselves on the sly still to be fashioned in the image of some all-powerful deity who is somehow outside of the universe, in order to have any "ends" of their own at all. Whence cometh human agency? This thinking cannot go by the name of "scientific" reason, because our best science sees us - as do all the contrib- utors to this volume - as a lifeform that has co-evolved among many others on this earth, and thereby must acknowledge that our human rea- son and agency exists in evolutionary continuity with nonhuman agencies all down the line. (If it were not thought offensive to some human groups - and it is not meant to be, unless the shoe fits - a resounding "Duhhh!" would seem appropriate here.) And whatever living organisms are "made of," it has to be something that is capable of expressing an "inner" life, and having purposes - at least those of surviving and repro- ducing - whether one wishes to invoke a "material transcendence" or not. There is nothing at all "scientific" about the metaphysical assumption that the universe is made up of little billiard balls randomly bouncing off one another, reacting to "external" forces alone. Mathews goes on to sketch her vision of post-materialist society, and the metaphysical premise upon which it is founded: matter has its own "inner principle," one already deserving of our respect, awe, and rever- ence, and therefore the entire universe is sacred, not a collection of dead stuff that we strangely disconnected humans can do with as we will. Mathews finds this post-materialist view to resonate well with Daoism, which calls on enlightened humans to discern the patterns of the larger whole and flow with them, not against them, in wu wei. (The idea of "intelligent design" seems to fit in here as well - of course there is immense organized complexity to the universe - that's undeniable, science documents it in ever-increasing detail, and if we're smart we will start fig- uring out how to mesh with it. The belief that it was all put together by some kind of male primate in the sky is what needs a bit more support, empirical, logical, or otherwise, before it gets taught in the public schools.) Recognizing that, unfortunately (would that we had, collec- tively, come to these realizations a few decades sooner), "[t]he human RONNIE HAWKINS I NTRO D U CTI ON 5</page><page sequence="6">population has now far exceeded the natural carrying capacity of the earth's ecosystems," however, Mathews holds that we need to move beyond just "going with the flow" and develop synergy with the rest of the biosphere, to take a more active role in choosing where we all evolve to next. She paints a very optimistic picture, in fact, of what we could do if we made up our minds to transform our "industry" and our "econom- ics" and other aspects of our socially constructed reality so as to enhance life on the planet instead of degrading and destroying it, and I do not dis- agree with her vision in any way other than to point out that so far we are stuck with a very big "if." The final essay in this collection, "The Concept of a Cultural Land- scape: Nature, Culture and Agency in the Land," is by Val Plumwood, and it begins with her reminding us that our survival is at stake and that those of us who know it are all, or should be, involved in a crtitical "cultural change project." Questions that arise thus include, to take some liberties with her more careful prose, "How did we manage to overlook the fact that we are overwhelming or undermining the very systems our lives depend on at every turn?" as well as "How do we wake up, inform our- selves about what's going on, and take action before it's too late?" The answer to the first question lies in the structure of our traditional "hege- monic concepts of agency." Plumwood's proximal target for much of this paper, an example of such hegemonic structuring, is the concept of "a cul- tural landscape," a way of seeing land, and nature generally, as nothing but a human artifact, a view that has become somewhat fashionable in the humanities of late. While some of the motivation behind this position may be to direct attention to the role of indigenous humans in creating the present form of land communities, the move serves to erase all non- human agency and creativity from our notion of place. (Moves like this sometimes make me wonder where concern for human beings leaves off and rationalizing the neglect of one's own science education takes over.) Plumwood very ably takes this "monological account" of agency apart, and I will leave her to it, other than to identify a couple of key points that I think merit further discussion here. One is the distinction she makes between "ecological rationality," which recognizes the dependence of the subject exhibiting it on all the other beings and systems that sustain it, and the other kind of supposed rationality, be it called "monological," "economic," or, as in Mathews' essay, "instrumental" rationality, a way of 6 ETHICS &amp; THE ENvFrONMENX 11(2) 2006</page><page sequence="7">thinking so obsessed with exploiting some part of the world that it loses sight of the whole and, in its single-minded way, ends up hacking away at the branch supporting its own subjectivity. It is a pity that many philoso- phers have not yet delved deep enough into the question of just what we mean by "rationality," since an awful lot of stupid things continue to be justified by appeal to this often poorly defined word. A second, related point is her identification of what she calls "exter- nal driver conceptual frameworks," which serve to legitimate the exertion of external "control" over something that is other to the driver and thus to make master-slave relationships seem the natural order of things, immune to conceptual challenge. In minimizing the agency of the "slave," be it a human whose labor is being stolen, a nonhuman animal reduced to a machine, or nature itself characterized as inert "matter," the master or driver is thinking and acting irrationally in an ecological sense. But this "external driver" framework can be seen to structure a sizeable chunk of the central metaphors through which "modern" societies understand the world, from the mistaken metaphysical premise of materialism - that everything is ultimately made of lifeless building bricks which must be pushed into place by some kind of "intelligent designer," theistic or humanistic - on up. It is at work behind the "master molecule" dogma, described by Evelyn Fox Keller and others, that lives on in our overfasci- nation with mechanistic biology; an up-to-the- minute version is reflected in the much-heralded goal of setting little nanomachines to work clean- ing out our arteries or removing amorphous gunk from the insides of our neurons, by injecting them into our bodies from the outside, of course. As Plumwood points out, our having gotten ourselves trapped in "external driver" frameworks "is one (partial) explanation of why societies evolve conceptual structures, such as those 'forgetting' essential services, that have negative survival value." Configuring many of the "metaphors we live by," this model of con- trol from the outside is deeply rooted and tenacious, and I would like to suggest at least one hypothesis as to why it might be so engrained within our way of thinking, an explanation that itself invokes a complex inter- relation between "nature" and "culture," attempting to connect the dots between our primate biology, patriarchy, and "external drivers." In our societies, we humans have so far followed the "chimpanzee path" of male bonding and male-dominated power hierarchies, and control of subordi- RONNIE HAWKINS INTRODUCTION 7</page><page sequence="8">nates by externally applied force is "natural" on this chimp model. Could we have so internalized this primary way of ordering relationships within our social groups as to have built it into the heart of our metaphysics - first as control wielded by a male deity and later as simply disembodied external "force," but always as power coming from the outside to contain and manipulate something that is "other" to it, weaker if not entirely pas- sive? And once we began to develop our facility with symbols and "culture" really got under way, of course, with the dominant gender gen- erally in charge of encoding and interpreting them, the opportunities for mutual reinforcement of this control-from-the-outside orientation would surely have multiplied. I will leave this thought as an open question for consideration. Before I end this editor's introduction, however, I would like to offer my own counter-apocalyptic vision to the mix. As I write the Middle East is exploding in escalating human warfare, and it does look to many like the "end times" are approaching. But with our technology for instanta- neous viewing and with vast information stores at our fingertips, we now have the capacity to see ourselves as we never have before, and if we start to see through the labels and the enormous symbolic superstructure that comprises our socially constructed reality in its present form, if we find the courage to see ourselves both from the inside and the outside, the cul- tural and the natural, I believe we will find ourselves looking at very flexible primates who do not need to live so stupidly. If we back away from the constricting conceptual boxes that freeze our attention on par- ticular patterns of grouping and take a wider view in time and space, we can trace ourselves back through many confluences, not only to the ori- gin of the three major religious parties to this conflict as tribes of Abraham, but, within the culture of nature, the wanderings and diaspo- ras of earlier hominids and, earlier still, of the emerging great ape clade, and so on.1 At some point we began using symbols, the key criterion for some definitions of culture,2 and that ability has proven both an enor- mous blessing and, in some ways, a terrible bane, since it allows us to override the perception of stark realities right in front of us - children killed by a bomb blast, land communities devastated - by shifting atten- tion to the signs and surfaces of conceptual structures that seem to provide justification: the flag that marks "our side," the rise and fall of the Dow Jones. 8 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 11(2) 2006</page><page sequence="9">My counter-apocalyptic vision is this: this is the end of the "world." Let it go. It need not be the end of the biosphere. The "world," as presently constructed, is not sustainable anyway, and those of us who are awake to our planetary situation know that and are already developing alternative ways of organizing human lifeways, materially and conceptu- ally. Philosophers have work cut out for them analyzing the ontology of concepts such as "the enemy"- or "money," for that matter, since this also exists only in the realm of symbol and sign. Psychologists and prima- tologists do too, because we need to put together a picture of group phenomena like fascist takeovers (large and small), scapegoating, and the creation of an "enemy" or an abject other by the drawing of a boundary creating unequal power relations.3 Meanwhile, women around the world (and many men too) are taking a cue from our bonobo cousins and bond- ing across all sorts of boundaries for the survival of Life on Earth. An individual's efforts can be primarily governed by the will to accomplish good in the world, to further the ends of flourishing biospherical life, or those efforts can be bound up with trying to maintain one's place within a primate hierarchy, and these often mean two very different things - a difference which is visible to discerning judgment. My answer to Val's sec- ond question, which inquires about our own human agency, is that we learn to see through the symbol-surfaces to what's going on in biological reality, say what we see in the face of the power structure, and subvert the old "world" by opening up to the synergy of the new. A final note: It seems imperative at this time in the evolution of our species that we work together to articulate a coherent, scientifically informed biocentric worldview. Such a way of understanding our reality would leave plenty of room for human cultural pluralism to thrive while recognizing the vast realms of commonness and continuity within which all living beings are situated. As Baldwin states, "All life creates value." Re-centering the coordinate axes of our thought on living organisms and systems pulls us back from the extremes of reducing everything to, on the one hand, (human) manipulations of words and symbols (the old saw "value requires a valuer" can apply to all lifeforms as long as we avoid becoming hopelessly entangled in linguistics), and, on the other, ram- shackle assemblages of Lego parts and pieces ultimately devoid of all meaning and value. The metaphysics of the Western world is currently rather badly in need of repair, and a good beginning in this regard might RONNIE HAWKINS INTRODUCTION 9</page><page sequence="10">be reworking our root metaphors to reflect the fact that the geometry of nature is fractal,4 not Euclidean, just as its causality is vitalistic, not mech- anistic. Perhaps philosophers, scientists, and artists can join hands in carrying out the needed reparation and renewal. NOTES 1. The current special issue of Scientific American on "becoming human" has some excellent short articles that put us humans in larger perspective. For synopses of our ancestral migrations with good graphics, see David R. Begun, "Planet of the Apes," and Kate Wong, "Stranger in a New Land," in Becoming Human, Scientific American 16 (2006): 4-13 and 38-47. Frans de Waal and Carel van Schaik also have important articles in this volume, and I would highly recommend de Waal's Our Inner Ape (New York: Riverhead Books, 2005). 2. See Carel van Schaik, Among Orangutans: Red Apes and the Rise of Human Culture (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2004), p. 139. For an account of how our vast symbolic superstructure came about, and a hardheaded examination of its ontology, see John R. Searle, The Construc- tion of Social Reality (New York: Free Press, 1995). 3. There has been much discussion about Philip Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment and other such investigations from an earlier time following disclosure of the abuses at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere. We do not need to continue "setting things up" in ways that will predictably result in violence and degradation of the human spirit. 4. I refer the reader to Gert Eilenberger, "Freedon, Science, and Aesthetics," in H. O. Peltgen and P. H. Richter, eds., The Beauty of Fractals: Images of Complex Dynamical Systems (Berlin: Springer- Verlag, 1986). Not only has the study of chaos and fractal mathematics finally slain LaPlace's demon, according to Eilenberger, it upholds the reality of the patterning of nature and explains our ability to conceptualize it mathematically: "Less abstractly, the ape, from which we are descended, had to have a very accu- rate idea of the geometry of space actually existing if he weren't to fall out of his tree and break his neck" (italics in the original, p. 178). It also gives us some clues as to where we may have gone wrong in our conceptual and concrete constructions: Our feeling for beauty is inspired by the harmonious arrange- ment of order and disorder as it occurs in natural objects-in clouds, trees, mountain ranges, or snow crystals. The shapes of all of these are dynamical processes jelled into physical forms. . . In comparison, our technical products are made stiff by the com- plete orderliness of their forms and functions. . . [We] built up 10 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 11(2) 2006</page><page sequence="11">our concepts (and prejudices) about the characteristic behavior of natural systems by observing artificial systems, systems which were chosen precisely for their regularity!
