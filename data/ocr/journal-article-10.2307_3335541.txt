<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dead Mothers of Okpella JEN ,BORGA7 Dead Mothers are masquerades commemorating festival- titled women among the Okpella, a northern Edo people living in midwestern Nigeria. They appear with other masked figures during the culminating daylight dance displays of Olimi-a festival held annually to honor ancestors and purify the community. In Okpella, as in most sub-Saharan African cultures, masking belongs publicly to the male domain. Ok- pella women have made inroads on this domain through their economic activities, acquiring the right to own masks although not to dance them. The general demeanor of masquerades depicting women suggests an ideal of feminine presence in Okpella culture, while the performance of these masquerades suggests a certain ambivalence in the attitude of men toward women. The Okpella (Ukpila) live approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City and 24-32 kilometers west of the Niger River. Located in what is now Bendel State, Okpella counts among its neighbors to the south, east, and west other Edo- speaking peoples, and to the north, the Igbira. As do many other northern Edo groups, Okpella recounts Benin origins in its orthodox history, although variant traditions and some cul- tural features suggest greater ethnic diversity (Borgatti 1976b, 1979b). On the fringes of the Benin empire, Okpella main- tained only nominal allegiance to the Oba of Benin by the nineteenth century. After the mid-nineteenth century, Is- lamized Nupe invaders drove Okpella citizens from their homes into the surrounding hills. Villages reformed around the turn of the century after the establishment of the Pax Britannica. Today, the Okpella number about 24,000 persons living in nine villages and utilizing approximately 520 square kilomet- ers of communal land. Traditional political authority at the village level is vested in a council of titled elders (Itsogwa); paramount ritual authority is in the hands of a night society (Ilukpekpe), organized at the quarter level. The leadership of the two organizations overlaps. Historically, the Okpella people believe in a supreme deity, Eshinegba, creator of all things in the material world (agbo) and the supernatural world (Ilimi). (Today, only an approximate one-third of the Okpella people follow the religion of their forefathers; the other two-thirds identify themselves as Christ- ian or Muslim.) Within the traditional religion, the spirits that most concern any person are his immediate ancestors or the collective ancestors of any group to which he belongs. Indi- viduals and small cult groups serve shrines dedicated to supernatural forces localized around certain natural phenomena, identified in some cases with mythical heroes. Men, and some women, may also belong to one or more cult groups-cum-masquerade societies whose focus is the control of anti-social forces, that is, witchcraft. At the end of the dry season, traditionally the end of the year, each compound head offers food-for-the-dead (akhlimimi) to propitiate ancestral spirits for the year to come. Since the turn of the century, four of the nine Okpella villages have in- corporated this ritual into a masking festival, Olimi, held to honor the ancestors and purify the community. It is within the context of this festival that Dead Mothers and Dead Fathers appear, and a festival-title for women has evolved. The festival-title for women associated with Olimi festival had a precedent in Okpella culture associated with a netted fiber masquerade, Aminague, which both predates and oper- ates independently of the Olimi festival complex. (This mas- querade is discussed and illustrated in Borgatti 1976b, pls. 1, 6). A titled woman (ozu) affiliated with Aminague achieves her status during childhood through oracular pronouncement. Olimi festival-titled women, known either as ozu or inyilimi (Mothers of Spirits), attain their status through oracular pro- 1.

Mothers of Spirits are entitled to own and be commemorated by masquerades, which are privileges not held by the festival-titled women of Aminague. A Mother of Spirits in Okpella has access to increased knowledge, dignitas, and spiritual benefits. She is privy to the "secrets" of masquerading and receives special blessings at the forest sanctuary. The presiding official asks God, the ances- tors, and the cult's tutelary spirits to look kindly upon a Mother for her generosity and to bring her health and strength, success in her endeavors, and baskets of luck and money. Protected by blessings, she may enjoy the perfor- mances of night masquerades,' restricted to initiates, as well as the daylight masking displays. As a Mother, she need not flee from an approaching masked dancer. The Okpella believe that women and children are suscepti- ble to the power emanated by the personified spirits. Women are thought to be especially vulnerable during their child- bearing years, and without special dispensation, women who touch or come too close to a masquerader will suffer physically or psychologically. The Okpella consider girls born during the culminating days of Olimi to be children of the spirits. Sac- rifices must be made on their behalf at the forest sanctuary to protect them from the power of the personified spirits who dance in the village at this time. A child of the spirits born at another time during the year makes her identity known by falling ill. Physical symptons will persist until her parents dis- cover the cause through divination and make the appropriate offerings at the cult shrine. A woman may also procure dis- pensation for herself by taking the festival title. She does this by making payments to the appropriate authorities, in this case, the night societies and the other Mothers, the procedure generally followed in all Okpella title-taking. Once she has taken the festival title, a woman may commis- sion a commemorative mask for herself and accompany it when it is danced by a kinsman during Olimi festival. In this way, she assures herself of remembrance after death, for otherwise her relatives may wait until they are disturbed by her spirit before having a mask carved and performed. A woman's children, or, in lieu of children, the night societies and the other Mothers, must bring out an existing mask annu- ally during the festival. The night societies and other mas- queraders also perform during the funeral ceremonies of a Mother to assist her in her journey to the supernatural world. The festival heralds, Inogiri (sing., Anogiri), play a particularly important role, for they provide the deceased with a dowry of foodstuffs, which establishes her as a person of consequence in the land of the dead. By taking the festival title, a woman incurs obligations as well as privileges. She must prepare food on behalf of the night societies for offerings at the forest sanctuaries and for guests of the village during Olimi festival. She must entertain the night societies with gifts of money and drink when they perform, and give something to each masked festival herald every time she is approached during the three-month festival period. In addition, she must be willing to undertake the ex- penses of bringing out and maintaining masquerades for female members of her family who bore the festival title before her. Taking the title itself is an expensive proposition for a woman, and recurrent annual expenses for gifts of food and drink further test her generosity. A title cost approximately $175 in 1973. To commission and consecrate a mask at this time cost a minimum of $33. The total expense was over $200-then the average annual income of a Nigerian adult. A title repre- sented a considerable investment; a comparable investment in the United States today would be a new car, costing $6,000 or $7,000. Among other northern Edo peoples and among the north- ern Ibo (Onitsha), women do relate to the masquerade societies but in much more restricted ways. Among the Ekperi subgroup of the northern Edo, important older women in the community are nominated to support the age-grade mas- querades that are performed every third year. Great prestige attaches to nomination, and in return for their financial sup- port, these women are allowed to accompany the masked dan- cers, sprinkling the crowd with a "cooling" solution of chalk and water to bring peace and luck to the community (Barnabas Alonokua, Azukhala-Ekperi, November 23, 1972). Among the Weppa-Wano subgroup of the northern Edo, older women may compete to buy the title "Mother of Mas- querades," gaining prestige by so doing; the title is restricted to one or two women who hold it until death (Ogakpogu Og- bachi Okhumai, Iviukhwe-Weppa, October 9, 1972). Among the northern Ibo, women who have raised successful sons may be inducted into the society of the "elder dead" after they have passed menopause. These women are considered the living counterparts of masquerades representing "the Maidens and their Mothers," but they never accompany the masked per- formers while dancing (Henderson 1972:351). In Onitsha, the masqueraders playing the Mothers wear horrific, bestial masks of the type usually associated with mas- 3. DEAD MOTHER OMONASE OWNED BY THE SADO FAMILY, AFOKPELLA.

Al- though the implications of this imagery have not been examined, it reinforces the idea that women past the age of menopause who are inducted into the men's masking society have become men in a metaphoric sense. In Okpella, Mothers of Spirits are considered men among women by virtue of their title and consequent relationship to the personified spirits. The clothing a Mother wears when going to the forest sanctuary expresses this notion; the man's red title hat in particular sig- nifies that these women may move about as men in this sac- rosanct area (Chief Felix Sado, Afokpella-Okpella, May 6, 1972). Although masks represent women among the northern Ibo, and female characters appear in northern Edo masquerades, the use of masks in commemorative ritual comparable to that for men is specific to Okpella, and within Okpella, to masks associated with the Olimi festival. Okpella women's ability to penetrate the realm of masked dancing relates in part to desac- ralization; masquerades appear to lose some of their sacred- ness and power when they pass from one ethnic group to another.2' The Okpella adopted the masks that today are a part of Olimi festival around the turn of the century. They have relaxed sanctions against women only in relation to these masquerades. Restrictions still operate in conjunction with the older and more powerful Aminague masquerade. Women's legal power played an important role as well. Paral- leling the men's traditional political association, Atsogwa (pl., Itsogwa), is a women's association, Ogbidegua (pl., Ig- bidegua), which has formal authority superseding men's at certain levels of interaction. (The Ogbidegua title for women is distinct from the festival titles ozui and inyilimi.) For example, the senior female titled elder, Ega, grants male title candidates permission to "take the feather," the feather of the vulturine eagle and symbol of title status. This commits them to under- take the expensive final ceremony known as Oghalo (Elders, Awuyemi-Okpella, May 4, 1972). She is the functional equiva- lent at this level of the senior male titled elder, the Otaru, at the next level. He grants the candidate permission to use the Ik- piema title drums without which the Oghalo ceremony cannot be completed. As a group, the female titled elders, or Ig- bidegua, also perform essential ritual and artistic acts to assist the title candidate in completing the Oghalo ceremony. As a group, they have the right to refuse to perform these tasks, and so to prevent an individual from assuming political power in the community (Borgatti 1975). In other words, Okpella women have a veto power within the traditional political sys- tem. Okpella women also occupied a strong position within the traditional economic system. They could acquire capital through inheritance and then increase their holdings through marketing activities. Okpella shares with neighboring North Ibie an idiosyncratic inheritance pattern that permits an eldest daughter to inherit her father's wealth if she has no male sib- blings (Thomas 1922:82). According to Northcote Thomas, all other northern Edo peoples display forms of inheritance based on primogeniture or on a collateral pattern in which the brother next in age to the deceased inherits his property 5.

Strict primogeniture characterizes Bini inheritance (Bradbury 1973:13), while a combination collateral- lineal pattern characterizes the northern Ibo (Onitsha) (Henderson 1972:183-184). In a small-scale economic system, cap- ital amassed must be dispersed in order to prevent severe income inequality. The title systems for men and women (At- sogwa and Ogbidegua), demanding a considerable display of resources, serve as devices for redistributing income in Okpella. However, the men's titles tend to circulate resources in the male sector of the community, while the women's titles tend to circulate them in the female sector. The Olimi festival-title for women seems to be an important formal mechanism by which men can channel women's wealth back into their own sec- tor of the economy. Not only are the ini- tial costs of this title high, but there are annual expenses as well. Women said that their reasons for tak- ing the festival-title were both interest in viewing the nocturnal and daylight mas- querades without harassment and a de- sire to be remembered by means of a commemorative mask. One Mother put it succinctly, saying that she wanted "history" (Iyawo Obamina, Afokpella- Okpella, May 21, 1973). The title brings spiritual benefits to the woman who takes it as well as prestige to her family. Okpella women had the political impor- tance and the economic power to realize their desires, and Okpella culture pro- vided institutional precedents that could be adapted to these ends, namely the existing ozu title linked to the netted fiber masquerade and the prestige titles for men and women. This combination seems to have resulted in the loosening of strictures against women's participa- tion in the masking activities of Olimi festival. As indicated earlier, sanctions against women still operate with respect to the older Aminague fiber mas- querades. The mask deemed most appropriate to represent women of high social and economic standing is a wooden three- quarter helmet with a finely featured and often light-colored face,3 surmounted by an elaborate, carved coiffure or figural superstructure. The dancer wears the mask with a "pajama suit" of a brightly patterned cotton, stocking feet of homespun cloth, and ankle rattles made of seed pods. Cloth wrappers, scarves, jewelry, and other items of feminine dress may be added to the costume be- fore a performance. A Dead Mother often carries a wicker fan or flywhisk as an emblem of authority and as an in- strument with which to extend and em- bellish the movements of arm and hand during the dance.4 Okpella incorporated the Dead Mother type into the newly formed Olimi festival in the late 1920s or early 1930s. It is said to have come at the same time as other masquerades, but no specific tradition of origin attaches to the Dead Mother, as it does to Dead Fathers or festival heralds, for example. The ad- dition of masquerade forms to the nuc- leus of offering food to the dead seems to have taken place over a forty-year period as a result of intense competition among festival congregations. Dead Fathers in one place were followed by a combina- tion of Dead Fathers and their servants, the festival heralds (Inogiri), elsewhere. The upstaged community retaliated with an elders' masquerade (Efofe), and within the following decade, Dead Mothers were introduced. All types seem to have disseminated rapidly among the congregations holding Olimi festival (Borgatti 1976b). The oldest ex- tant Dead Mother masks (Figs. 2, 5, 6) date from the late 1920s and early 1930s and were purchased by their owners from non-Okpella carvers. These masks appear to be prototypes for those cur- rently carved in Okpella. In all of the wooden examples documented, the Dead Mother mask displays a broadly scalloped hairline, with hair differentiated from the face in color or chip-carved texture. Eyebrows in relief define the featured area of the face. The face is rendered in a relatively schematic way with little or no modeling to suggest natural contours. The facial plane itself is recessed and slightly slop- ing beneath the brows. Almond-shaped eyes flank a long, straight nose that is thin-ridged and finely chiseled. Narrow lips are carved in relief and parted slightly to reveal teeth. Expressions range from a coolness verging on hauteur in the most successful masks to a kind of stolid passivity in others. Ears may be carved on the sides of the mask. Eyes, mouth, and often ear lobes are pierced, and incised designs represent- ing facial scarification are outlined in a color contrasting with the color of the face. TOP LEFT: 6.

The Okpella call this hairstyle aeklukliu, which means "circular" or "closed" plaits. The quality of Odika's work was appreciated to the extent that a second mask, Dead Mother Igini, was commis- sioned some years later (Fig. 6). These two fine examples clearly inspired Lawrence Ajanaku, the man generally considered the best carver in Okpella to- day, in his 1969 carvings of Dead Mother Ugunuale (Fig. 4) and Dead Mother Omonase (Fig. 3). Although unable to match the elegance of Odika's composi- tion or his delicate handling of form and proportion, Lawrence maintains the general scheme set out by his predeces- sor. Dead Mother Oriyekia, allegedly carved about 1968 by Stephen Isah, Lawrence Ajanaku's nephew, displays a distinctly different hairstyle (ofa)5 al- though the face remains in the Okpella mode (Fig. 8). Dead Mother Elewo (Fig. 2), carved by a Weppa Wano carver whose name is no longer remembered, was purchased around 1934 and serves as the pro- totype for more recently carved masks with figural superstructures, such as Dead Mother Idebua, carved about 1970 by Asume of Ogiriga-Okpella (Fig. 1), and the Dead Mother as yet unnamed 11.

(Fig. 7), carved by Samuel Belu in 1973. In the locally carved versions, the figural superstructure has been scaled down to a size more appropriate to the mas- querade's dance character as this has evolved in Okpella. The Dead Mother mask bears no generic name other than olimi (pl., ilimi), the term used for all masked characters and which translates as "spirit." Each mask bears the name of the woman it commemorates along with praise names connoting physical charm or prestige. The unnamed Dead Mother mentioned above (Fig. 7) will take the name of its owner; until she dies, it is inappropriate to call the mask by her name. Praise names generally reinforce the character of the visual image. Oyoyo, one of Dead Mother Ugunuale's names (Fig. 4), means "something bright, quick, and pretty"; Ogiegho, one of Dead Mother Elewo's names (Fig. 2), indicates a "chief with money" and refers to the wealth of a woman who takes the festival-title. The elaborate hairdressings charac- teristic of a Dead Mother mask also suggest wealth, for a woman so coiffed could not headload firewood, water, or produce from the farm.6 The figural superstructure of the masks refers to seniority and authority in a generalized way, as does the image of the python that appears on the masks in Figures 1 and 7. The mask figures suggest real children, whose birth gives a woman adult status in Okpella society, and, simultaneously, the followers or retain- ers who always cluster around persons of importance. The python is a guardian figure in Okpella tradition (Borgatti 1975) a well as "king of snakes" in Bini mythology (Ben-Amos 1976:246-247). The general aloofness of a Dead Mother's expression corresponds to an African ideal of comportment indicative of good breeding (Thompson 1974). The costuming-expensive cloth, jewelry, scarves, and other paraphernalia-fur- ther emphasizes wealth and its correlate authority to reinforce the image pro- jected by the mask itself. Seniority and status combine with youthful represen- tation-fine features, smooth skin, small breasts, and vigorous, rather than stately, dancing-in accordance with Af- rican notions of honorific representation (Thompson 1974:5-7). Dead Mother Elewo (Fig. 2) must be seen as an excep- tion to this dance rule, since the superstructure is so large and unwieldy. As noted earlier, figural superstructures have been scaled down in Okpella- carved masks to accommodate the dancer in performance. The Dead Mother mask falls into a style continuum with the better known Ibo "maiden spirit" mask, a white-faced female mask featuring a bridal coiffure and worn with a cloth applique body suit. Northern Ibo masked dancers mimic the movements of young women with the intent of projecting an image of youthful feminine beauty, at least at a superficial level (Boston 1960:60). Al- though Okpella's female masks resemble those of the Ibo, they differ with respect to character and significance-hence the need to consider masquerades as en- sembles within specific cultural contexts when interpreting mask imagery. The Dead Mother masquerade, owned and cared for by a woman and commemorat- ing a woman of high status, has incorpo- rated into its iconography the Okpella symbols of legitimate authority: chil- dren, the python, the accoutrements of wealth, and-in performance-the greeting gesture restricted in use to Ok- pella's most important women, the Ig- bidegua titled elders. Status and wealth are honored by an appearance of relative youth and dynamic dance expression. At a more generalized level of mean- ing, the Dead Mother mask corresponds to the female, or "beauty," masks, which express societal ideals such as wealth, status, enterprise, culture, and social harmony in many southern Nigerian cul- tures (Blier 1976:7-8). In most instances, however, these female masks are owned by powerful men's societies. They do not represent specific women, nor are they linked to women's status, as is the Dead Mother mask in Okpella. A Dead Mother's character is most clearly revealed when contrasted with its male counterpart, the Dead Father-the first masquerade to be incorporated into the Olimi festival complex. Dead Fa- thers, like Dead Mothers, fall into the general category of personified spirits (ilimi), but they are distinguished generi- cally by the terms omieshle and aja, cog- nates with words in other northern Edo dialects referring to the same mas- querade type. Each commemorative omeshlie, or Dead Father, bears the name of the elder it represents. The Dead Father masquerade (Fig. 10) consists of a cloth tube sewn across the bottom and gathered at the top around a wooden stem. Ideally, wide panels of handwoven red cotton from the Igbira town of Okene alternate with slim panels of sacred cloth called ebe, woven of red wool and raffia and imported from Lokoja some 95 kilometers to the north- east of Okpella (Borgatti 1976b: pl. 7). According to some Okpella elders, relics 54</page><page sequence="8">12. DEAD MOTHER TYPE (HARLOT) OWNED BY AIYEKPOJU ITAFITA OF OGUTE. CARVED ca. 1968 BY LAWRENCE AJANAKU OF OGIRIGA.

During the culminating daylight dance displays of Olimi festival, the an- cestors convene in masked form at the village performance ground to celebrate with their living kin the successful com- pletion of festival ritual. A Dead Father, often the senior in the congregation, opens the display by leaping across the dance area-now outstretched, now hunched over-as the drums and gongs call out his special rhythms. He may plunge to the ground at the center of the circle, beating the topknot on the earth in an act of prayer. He may circle the arena, pausing to greet old friends and nod blessing. When tired, he retires to a seat of honor next to the musicians, where attendants fan him. Dead Mothers enter the playing ground in their turn, alternating with Dead Fathers. Each one circles the dance area accompanied by a retinue of festival-titled females; pride of place next to the masquerader is given to the custo- dial Mother of Spirits. The dancer, a young kinsman of the owner, punctuates a stylized walk with the graceful greeting of a female titled elder to acknowledge friends and dignitaries. The Dead Mother may dance before a select group or groups of people prior to moving into the center to perform for the audience as a whole. Dancers may give several short solo performances (okelo) during the course of the afternoon's display. Nor- mally, only one dancer at a time occupies the center, for to be okelo, to dance alone, is to be a virtuoso performer whose danc- ing is to be enjoyed without distracting competition. In between times, the masker sits alongside the Dead Fathers and is fanned by attendants. Before completing the afternoon's perfor- mance, a Dead Mother often executes a final dance passage facing the orchestra to honor the musicians. The Dead Mother is anthropomorphic in form, the mask providing the figure with an elegantly impassive face, while a Dead Father is mysterious and awe- some, that "which walks leaving no footprint on the ground" (erni iii e kia eke iii se ime owe o)-a circumlocution used by Otaru Enamude to describe the mas- querade (Afokpella-Okpella, March 14, 1973). The visual equation of female with human, and male with non-human, ex- presses Okpella's belief in the funda- mental difference between the sexes at the domain level. This difference is exploited for sym- bolic expression and further developed through dance. According to Margaret Drewal, the Dead Mother dances more complex rhythms and places greater emphasis on stamping patterns than do other masked figures performing during the daylight dancing.7 A Dead Father, in contrast, utilizes a single basic running step to manipulate his cloth, to "roll it over the ground," as the term olmesile onomatopoetically conveys to the Ok- pella ear. During a characteristic solo per- formance lasting only 45 seconds, a Dead Mother changes rhythm pattern or tempo four or five times. The solo climaxes with a passage of highly per- cussive dancing lasting 8-10 seconds, which ends on the beat with a closing formula. As one would expect, the music played for a Dead Mother is also more complex than that played for a Dead Fa- ther. According to musicologist Robert Witmer,8 it displays the African propen- sity for being "multi-parted and multi- levelled" (Lomax 1971:19). When the two musics are played simultaneously, as sometimes happens toward the end of an afternoon's performance, the rhythm for Dead Fathers predominates, al- though it is tempered by the pervasive presence of extensive master drum varia- tions over the supporting web of fixed patterns (Witmer 1975: personal com- munication). Although a Dead Mother dances the most complex rhythms, a Dead Father displays the highest energy when danc- ing. Dead Fathers carry the praise name onokaka, something arduous or demand- ing great strength. The dancer changes the shape of the image, its direction, and its level while maintaining a constant rhythm pattern and a tempo measured at 240 beats per minute, as opposed to 185 for a Dead Mother at her height. In per- formance, the two form a paradigm of hot and cool, with Dead Fathers repre- senting the essence of masculine physi- cal power and aggressive behavior, and Dead Mothers, feminine grace and com- pos ure. In traditional West African philoso- phy, the difference between male and female is seen as complementary opposi- tion rather than polar opposition (Fraser 1974). The underlying biological refer- 55</page><page sequence="9">ence is clear. Complementarity is suggested in Okpella not only by the dif- ference in masquerade imagery, but also by choreography, musical relationships, and other cultural data (the intersecting title systems for men and women, for example). In West African art, paired male and female images are often used to express complementarity among things identified as masculine and feminine re- spectively, the symbolic statement hav- ing its roots in the biological one. In Ok- pella, Dead Mothers and Dead Fathers symbolize complementary qualities. The feminine image combines with a dance both complex and controlled to express the idea of cool accomplishment. The abstract masculine image combines with a dance strenuous in the extreme to suggest an ideal of achievement through strength and individual effort.9 The metaphors reflect values firmly embedded in Okpella culture,'1 but the identification of hot with male and cool with female is hardly specific to Okpella. According to Henry and Margaret Dre- wal (1975), the Yoruba make these prin- ciples explicit in the context of Gelede masked dancing. Contrastive notions about masculine and feminine demeanor underlie the "beauty" and "beast" mas- querades found among the Ibo and Ibibio (Blier 1974, 1976; Cole 1969; Mes- senger 1973; Ottenberg 1972). Williams (1968) says of the Bedu masks found in Ghana and Ivory Coast that dance movements express the contrast in male-female roles: the female's walk is graceful and slow, as is appropriate for a woman; the male moves quickly and un- predictably, as befits a man. Similarly, Bamana Chi Wara masks are danced in pairs, the male performing dramatic leaps and the female dancing in a more restrained manner (Fraser 1974: 27). Other examples could be given, and further research may reveal the paradigm to be as widespread as the concept of cool itself, which Thompson (1973) has shown to be of such impor- tance in African aesthetics. While the paradigm may be a valid generalization, the nuancing of the im- agery is likely to differ according to specific cultural contexts. In Okpella, the masks representing women are owned by women but danced by men, a situa- tion that permits the infusion of an ele- ment of parody into the performance. The young male dancers slip explicit sexual gestures into virtuoso dance pas- sages-most commonly, a pelvic display combined with the thrust of a flywhisk between the legs. The movement calls forth gales of laughter and shouts of 13. DEAD MOTHERS IGINI AND UGUNUALE. "harlot" (ayakaya) from men in the audi- ence-a term that hardly seems cross- referenceable with a mother or sister.1" Older men have encouraged this satirical dance behavior by introducing non- commemorative entertainment versions of the Dead Mother (Fig. 12) in recent years 12-an indication that the paradoxi- cal image both amuses and satisfies its Okpella audience. One way to interpret this element of parody is to see it as a reflection of male ambivalence toward women in Okpella. Tension between the sexes exists in all cultures. Socially sanctioned ribaldry provides for its expression and release among other northern Edo groups (Bor- gatti 1976a), and the occasional satiric figure appears in the masking displays of the Ekperi and the Weppa-Wano: Oyelepete, the pregnant woman who waddles, and Anugbeme, the jealous wife. Among the Afikpo Ibo, Ottenberg suggests that masking "mirrors the sense of dependency of men upon women, men's anxiety over female be- havior and the idea of the separation of the sexes rendered particularly acute be- cause of the matrilineal structure of Afikpo society" (1975: 202). Social or economic conditions may exacerbate ambivalence, as Ottenberg indicates for Afikpo. In Okpella, the po- tential for women to become economi- cally independent has expanded greatly in the last ten years as the price forgari, a cereal food prepared by women from cassava, which is a woman's crop and sold by women in the market, has risen dramatically in response to demands from urban populations. Although Ok- pella women commanded considerable resources traditionally, the current situa- tion could be seen as threatening to male dominance in this rural area. The dance gesture appears to be a reassertion of masculine authority, not unlike the warning against promiscuity (the onus is on the female in Okpella) sung by the night society during Olimi festival. The jibe serves as a reminder to women that despite their inroads into the domain of masked dancing (and perhaps other realms also), control remains with the 56</page><page sequence="10">masculine sector. Even though a relative egalitarianism prevails in Okpella cul- ture, men have the edge-the Otaru out- ranks the Ega, sons inherit in preference to daughters, and male masquerades of the Dead Father type both open and close the daylight dances of Olimi. Whatever resonance the parody has in Okpella culture, it is the festival context that permits manipulation of the feminine image. The depiction of taboo behavior in public by an ostensibly vir- tuous woman adds spice to the perfor- mance and is only one of the many rever- sals enlivening Olimi.13 The Okpella people delight in paradox. Festival el- ders chortled that during Olimi their mothers were their wives. Although this would be impossible in the real world because of strictures against incest, it happens in the festival world. The el- ders, members of the night society, be- come spirits (ilimi) at this time, and their festival-titled wives become Mothers of Spirits (inyilimi). Thus their wives be- come their mothers. There is an equally amusing play upon adult-child and authority-non-authority roles in the standard request a personified spirit makes of his Mother during the festival period. The masked heralds say, "I want to suck your breasts," meaning that they want money for drink. A Mother re- sponds with some coins, for she is ob- liged to nourish her children. The de- mand is not without sexual innuendo, and when addressed to the author it caused great amusement, for foreigners are generally greeted with great courtesy and decorum. Men playing women, another rever- sal, creates a situation inherently absurd and one in which parody seems inevita- ble.14 The masquerade provides the ve- hicle for overt sexual satire because per- sonified spirits are not circumscribed by human morality or etiquette. Indeed, spirits in Okpella find definition in being unlike humans, in transgressing their canons. For example, the Okpella de- scribe the masked festival herald (Anogiri) as grotesque to humans but beautiful to other spirits-the simul- taneity creating yet another tickling anomaly-because the canons of human beauty differ from those of spirit beauty.15 Spirits are active during the night, rather than during the day as are human beings, and they have their own dialects and modes of greeting that are never used in profane contexts. Spirits live in a looking-glass world in which everything is reversed: mothers become wives; the night, day; the ugly, beautiful; the junior, senior; and the honorific-for the Dead Mother is fundamentally an honorific image in Okpella-a parody.'16 Okpella women assumed both privileges and obligations vis-a-vis mas- querades introduced after the turn of the century. The image deemed appropriate to honor a woman of rank combined feminine cool and complexity of perfor- mance with the symbols of legitimate authority-and contrasted sharply with the commemorative mask for men in both aspect and performance. Because men dance the masks, and hypotheti- cally feel threatened by inroads women have made upon their domain, an ele- ment of parody attaches to the image. Although interesting in themselves, the Dead Mothers of Okpella lead us to consider more general issues, such as the relationship between economics, art, and social status. The Okpella data illus- trate the principle that economic power enables a subordinate group to assume or adapt social privileges once the pre- rogative of a dominant group-and that the extension of social privilege to mem- bers of the subordinate group marks a rise in their social status. ~ A second issue concerns the metaphoric use of the feminine image in art. In Okpella, the Dead Mother repre- sents a specific woman (by name) as well as an idealized one (by attributes that suggest wealth and authority). At the same time, the masquerade personifies an idea. Because of qualities considered inherently feminine, the female image in Okpella and elsewhere in Africa be- comes a metaphor of ideal behavior and positive philosophy, of cool. Thus we see the Yoruba Shango staff described by Thompson (1971) as "a parable of fire cooled by feminine grace"; the Ibibio mfon Ekpo masquerade ("the good an- cestor"), a feminine image which func- tions as a symbol of past virtue setting an example for the present (Messenger 1973); the Nafana paired Bedu masks, cool conveyed by "female" performance (Williams 1968) and the ideological weight of cool neatly expressed by the larger female figure as it is among the Senufo (Glaze 1975); and finally, we see the Dead Mothers of Okpella, mas- querades symbolizing the ideal of ac- complishing a difficult task with perfect composure.

Adams at Harvard University. I would like to thank Dr. Filomena Steady, then in the Anthropology Department at Boston University, for critically reading this early version. Research in Nigeria was carried out from 1971 to 1974 under the auspices of the Nigerian Federal Department of Antiquities and partially funded by the following agencies: Museum of Cultural History, UCLA-Ralph Altman Fund; Regents of the University of California-Patent Fund; and NDEA Title VI grants through the African Studies Center, UCLA. 1. According to Okpella definition, personified spirits (ilimi) that appear at night cloaked by darkness are no different from those that appear during the day in masquerade form. 2. Brain and Pollock record a number of such instances in their discussion of Bangwa cultural dynamics (1971:18, 108, 110). 3. The Okpella do not distinguish symbolically between light and dark versions of the Dead Mother mask; the choice of one or the other is a matter of personal taste. 4. There is an interesting analogy in the practice of jazz pianists wearing a diamond "which would flash in the treble passages"; i.e., the jewel is used to extend the brilliance of a phrase (Thompson 1974:154). 5. This hairstyle is called ofa in reference to the lozenge- shaped woven raffia containers for beans that one sees sus- pended from tree branches in Okpella villages. The plaits of hair "moving downward" from the central tuft of hair to the forehead and nape of the neck recall the shape of the bean container. 6. Thompson (1971) refers to the shooting headdress of Eshu as an abrogation of communal responsibilities, which is the prerogative of both divinity and royalty in Yorubaland. 7. I am indebted to Margaret Thompson Drewal for taking the time to watch films and suggest descriptions of move- ment sequences. The sample consisted of approximately 45 minutes of filmed dancing, which included festival heralds, the architectural masquerade associated with the junior night society, the elders' masquerade, and uncostumed attendants as well as Dead Mothers and Dead Fathers. 8. I am equally indebted to Robert Witmer of the Music Department, York University, Toronto, for taking the time to listen to tapes and suggest the appropriate musical descrip- tions. The sample consisted of three selections: (1) music played for Dead Fathers exclusively, (2) music played for a Dead Mother exclusively, and (3) music played while both types of masquerade were dancing in different sections of the performance area. 9. This might be called the Ikenga principle. According to Jeffreys's survey of Ikenga practice in many parts of Iboland, the Ikenga symbolizes qualities-aggression and strength-- apropriate to men. Women do not have Ikenga shrines as a general rule because these qualities are not considered feminine (1954:24-40). 10. Both behavioral ideals manifest themselves in the context of the prestige titles for men (Itsogwa) and women (Ig- bidegua) for example. The wealth accumulated for title- taking purposes stands as a testament to an individual's achievement through hard work. The title ceremonies them- selves subject the individual to certain psychological ordeals that he is expected to endure with equanimity. 11. The term may be seen as a kind of back-handed compli- ment, however, since women of easy virtue dress well and are expensive to maintain. 12. Iddo has two noncommemorative masks: Ayakaya and Guinea or One Pound One Shilling; Ogute has one mask bearing only the name Ayakaya (Fig. 13); Ogiriga has two masks whose names were given as Ayakaya and Akwete (Highlife Music) initially, but which subsequent investigation revealed to be commemorative masks dubbed with these names by their young dancers. 13. The various paradoxes could be listed as riddles, as in the example: "When is a man not a man?" Answer: "When he is a spirit" (masquerader). The Okpella do have a category for riddles and jokes (itsee), but it is not clear whether or not the conundrums of Olimi festival fall into this category. 14. Ottenberg (1970) suggests that the Afikpo Okumpka plays similarly derive humor from elements of role reversal, especially that of men impersonating women. 15. Foss documents a parallel example among the southern Edo: "The masks are simultaneously beautiful and fearsome. By definition, the closer the resemblance to the spirit, the greater the beauty (omna) in the eyes of the spirit. Conversely, a successfully carved mask instills terror into mortal viewers" (1974:23). 16. Barbara Babcock's edited book, The Reversible World (1976), explores this notion in a number of cultural contexts. 17. H. W. Janson (1976) demonstrates this principle at work in the history of Western tomb sculpture: initially the pre- rogative of royalty, by the nineteenth century, secular and sacred commemorative sculpture was the status symbol of anyone who could pay for it.
