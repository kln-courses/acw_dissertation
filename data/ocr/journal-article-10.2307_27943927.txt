<plain_text><page sequence="1">Founders of Constructive Postmodern Philosophy: Peirce, James, Bergson, Whitehead, and Hartshorne. David R. Griffin, editor. Albany: SUNY Press, 1993. 241 pages. $14.95, Paper, $44.50, Hardcover. (Reviewed by Susan J. Armstrong, Humboldt State University) This is a valuable and well-written collection of essays, which both describes the antecedents and consequences of constructive postmodern philosophy, and also demonstrates the individual contributions of Peirce, James, Bergson, Whitehead, and Hartshorne, three of whom are American thinkers. The essays are written not primarily for specialists but for students of philosophy. They are well-annotated advocacy pieces, arguing for the importance of the thinkers discussed. Each essay is capable of standing alone, and hence the collection contains a considerable amount of repetition. In his lucid and insightful introduction, David Griffin predicts that his distinction between constructive and deconstructive postmodernism will be the most controversial aspect of the book. The distinction is based on the view that postmodernism is a sentiment rather than a specific theory, and therefore a postmodern theory need not reject everything associated with modern philosophy (used here to designate the worldview which has developed out of seventeenth-century Galilean-Cartesian-Baconian-Newtonian science.)</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 15, No. 3, September, 1994 333 Griffin points out that each type of postmodern philosophy sees the other as not "truly" postmodern, due to differences concerning the ideal of rationality, which lead in turn to substantial differences concerning ontology and epistemology. From the standpoint of constructive postmodernism, deconstructive postmodernism is the logical result of the inadequacies of modem philosophy, and hence is in fact "hyper-modern." Modern philosophy is flawed primarily by two inadequate doctrines. First, modern philosophy is based on a materialistic (anti-animistic) doctrine of nature, according to which the ultimate units of nature are vacuous, without any kind of self-motion. Nature is thoroughly mechanistic. Secondly, modern philosophy is based on a sensationist doctrine of perception, according to which all perception is based on sense-perception. The failure of modernism is exhibited not only in its acceptance of a mysterious relationship between mind and body and in its inability to resolve the contradiction between a determined world and a free will, but in its inability to encompass all of human experience. Inconvenient types of evidence, such as religious experience, are simply ignored. Citing the work of several contemporary historians of science, Griffin maintains that the claims of modern philosophy as to the nature of nonobservable, ultimate units of nature were primarily based not on empirical investigation but on theological and sociological motives. A dead universe required a first mover, as well as supernatural intervention to explain the occurrence of miracles. The dualism of soul/body supported the belief in immortality: the fact that the mind or soul is a self-moving thing showed that it need not share the fate of our bodies. And mechanism, in the words of Robert Boyle, cleared the way for "the empire of man over the inferior creatures of God" (Robert Boyle, The Notion of Nature, Vol. IV of The Works of the Honerable Robert Boyle [London: Miller, 1744], p. 363). In contrast, Griffin advocates "panexperientalism", the view that nature consists of entities which experience their world. These entities are partly self-determining, whether they be part of "inanimate" things or part of a human personality. The mind and brain differ in the complexity and organization of their constituents but are not ontologically distinct. According to Griffin there are several ways in which panexperientialism overcomes the complete relativism which is often a consequence of deconstructive postmodernism. First, panexperientialism provides a way beyond the current impasse concerning the objective reality</page><page sequence="3">334 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy of the world. The claim that the world includes a given, objective element has been rejected by many, including deconstructive postmodernists, as untenable "foundationa?sm": the idea of a reality beyond ourselves to which our ideas could correspond is groundless. Yet in our ordinary lives we cannot help but assume that the world is real, that its reality is given to us in perception, and that the world includes a noninterpreted element to which true ideas correspond. By its recognition that perception is often nonsensory, panexperientialism offers a solution. We can fully admit that "reality" is a human construct and that we directly apprehend other actual things. Whitehead terms this nonsensory perception "perception in the mode of causal efficacy," by means of which we directly "prehend" other things as actual and causally efficacious for us. Sensory perception, on the other hand, provides us with sense-data, which are indeed constructed by the perceiver. Another way in which panexperientialism avoids extreme relativism is its affirmation of "privileged beliefs," defined as those which we inevitably presuppose in practice, even though we deny them verbally. These beliefs or intuitions constitute a "bottom layer of experience that is common to all humanity." Of the five thinkers discussed in the book, James and Hartshorne are the most concerned to maintain that no extant belief system reflects adequately all of those universal presuppositions. People from other traditions and cultures undoubtedly know some things that we do not know. The appropriate attitude for any seeker of knowledge, then, is one of humility and openness to diverse cultures and traditions. Another major difference between constructive and deconstructive forms of postmodern philosophy is that the former speaks of God. Not the traditional deity of premodem and early modern philosophy and theology, but God as "something ?ke a soul of the universe." Griffin argues that belief in God as receptive soul of the universe grounds the belief that truth about facts exists, and that belief in God as active soul of the universe grounds the belief that we can make moral judgments which reflect more than personal or cultural values. In contrast to Richard Rorty's "irony," constructive postmodernism issues in engagement with the world and its challenges. Peter Ochs' essay cai Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) is noteworthy both for its scholarship and for its novel and evocative approach to the Ufe and work of a philosopher. Ochs is aware of the inevitable failure of any attempt</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 15, No. 3, September, 1994 335 to convey the dynamic of a philosopher's life; indeed, he states that such attempts are "somewhat abusive" in their impatient brevity and abstraction. Ochs characterizes Peirce as "the logician of postmodernism," arguing that Peirce engendered in himself a "disciplined variety of postmodern thinking." According to Ochs, the dominant influence in Peirce's early Ufe was his father, an eminent mathematician and a devout Unitarian, for whom mathematics was "a kind of religious worship." Pierce later joined the Episcopal Church, whose "general essence and spirit" he continued to "profoundly believe." Ochs provides a useful account of Peirce's intellectual development, followed by imagined responses by Peirce to questions put by a "nonrelativistic postmodernist." Ochs' discussion is too complex to recount here, but it exhibits Peirce's postmodernism as a self-critical, pragmatic, situated method of habit-change, which affirms the objective reality of chance, force, and love as principles of evolution. Pierce explicitly affirmed anthropomorphism: he maintained that God's symbol-creating activities are comparable to humanity's symbol creating activities, or "abduction." The universe as a vast symbol is the creation of a cosmic symbol-maker. Instead of speaking in the past tense, we should says that "God is now creating the world" as symbolizer. The ultimate interpr?tants of God's symbol making are forms of habit-changing. Marcus P. Ford characterizes William James (1842-1910) as rejecting both physicalism and psychophysical dualism. According to James's radical empiricism, sense-perception comprises only a fraction of what is given in direct experience. Experience includes memory, religious experience, and psychic experience. To account for these facts, James developed a process panpsychism. Ford characterizes James's belief in God as postmodern because for James God is not omnipotent, absolutely transcendent, or impassible. Rather, God is a "struggling artist," active and suffering in the world. Belief in God is legitimate not only because it cannot be shown to be false but because it can inspire us to adopt the "strenuous mood," a vigorous engagement with the challenges of Ufe. Ford cites James' creative vision of a world without war as an additional aspect of his postmodernism. Pete Gunter shows how Henri Bergson (1859-1941) progressed from an early dua?sm to a reconception of the physical world as a mode of duration with psychological characteristics. In doing so Bergson anticipated the discoveries of classical quantum physics nearly thirty years later. Mind and</page><page sequence="5">336 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy body are thought of as a polarity, distinguishable but in fact always intermingled. Gunter examines several of Bergson's major concepts (memory, the elan vital, intuition) and then identifies what he considers to be fruitful consequences of Bergson's philosophy. One such consequence is the impetus Bergson's urgings give to the task of eliminating war. Bergson also provides a useful distinction between the closed and the open forms of religious life. For Bergson, the "closed" form of religious life is that of "natural religion," with its magic, totemism, mana, chance, prayer, and sacrifice. But religion can also be "open" and dynamic, calling us to transcend tribalism, nationalism, classicism, and egoism. An open society seeks justice for the individual and is motivated ultimately by love, "fraternity." Bergson characterizes most contemporary religious practice as mixed and agrees that most great mystics have had abnormal experiences. Yet he maintains that the ultimate achievement of the mystics involves loving, socially concerned action. The religion of the open society can unify humanity in an healing, inclusive way. John Cobb notes that Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947) generously credits William James as the originator of a new stage in philosophy, in which new root metaphors or paradigms emerge and are "radically thought through and rigorously tested against the whole range of evidence." Postmodernism in the Whiteheadian sense rejects the "antirationalism" of modern thought. Cobb provides an excellent introduction to basic Whiteheadian concepts, in terms of which all events are occasions of experience. Sense perception has two modes, one of which, "perception in the mode of causal efficacy," is not limited to that part of the world which acts on our sensory organs. Cobb emphasizes Whitehead's contribution to the understanding of the importance of both religion and science as the "two basic sources of reflection." According to Whitehead, religion will not regain its old power until it can face change, as does science, and "take the whole evidence into account." Whitehead sees in Buddhism and Christianity the most prominent sources of human religious development, and indeed notes that his cosmological vision is closer to East Asian than to Western metaphysical traditions. Nevertheless his personal insights were formed by Plato (in thought) and Jesus (in life). For Whitehead God is a dipolar actual entity, "one everlasting process of integrating all that happens with all possibility."</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 15, No. 3, September, 1994 337 What is past in the world Uves everlastingly in God, who is "the feUow sufferer who understands." The volume concludes with an essay on Charles Hartshorne (1897-) by David Griffin. Griffin notes that Hartshorne shares with Whitehead the doctrines of panexperientialism, the priority of nonsensuous perception, and naturahstic theism. Griffin enumerates the many advantages of Hartshorne's type of panexperientialism, emphasizing that one of Hartshorne's greatest contributions is the idea of the compound individual, according to which the dominant member of a society occupies the entire spatial region of the society. On this view the mind or soul encompasses at least the region of the brain and perhaps that of the entire nervous system. In addition, Hartshorne affirms a hierarchy of compound individuals, based on the power to determine oneself and to exert influence on others. Thus the human mind is more powerful than the body; God can be seen as the soul of the universe, and therefore its supreme power. Evil results from multiple finite freedoms. "God does influence very event, but divine influence is always persuasion." In contrast to Whitehead, Hartshorne conceives of God not as a single everlasting actual entity but by analogy with the human soul, and hence as a "living person," a temporal society of occasions of experience. According to Hartshorne, the real argument for God is that denying God requires one to deny several practically indispensable behefs. Overall the volume is an excellent introduction to constructive postmodernism as expressed in five major thinkers. The possibiUties for a naturalistic doctrine of God are presented in the context of each thinkers' thought as a whole. Founders of Constructive Postmodern Philosophy exhibits the intellectual sophistication and power of such a naturalism, as well as the many forms it can take.</page></plain_text>
