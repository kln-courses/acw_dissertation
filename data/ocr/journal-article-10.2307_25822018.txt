DUB AN DISTORTION AS A POETIC DEVICE IN THE PURSUIT OF HEKTOR AND RELATED EVENTS * As in a dream one is unable to overtake a man in flight; the one fails to flee, the other to overtake, so failed Achilles to overtake him in the race, and Hektor to escape . (Iliad, XXII, 199-201) I crashed back into the water, now following the long green thread with all the suspense of Ariadne; and to it added the weight of slowness which only heartsick apprehension brings. I knew in my heart that I was swimming vigorously - yet it seemed like one of those slow-motion films where human actions, delayed by the camera, are drawn unctuously out to infinity, spooled out like toffee. How many light years would it take to reach the end of it? Down I went, and down, into the dwindling phosphores cence, into the deep shadowed coolness of the pool . (L. DURBELL, Clea) I - ACHILLES DEHUMANIZED In his Pursuit of Hektor, Samuel Bassett discussed the masterly use of poetic means to overcome the difficulties presented by the theme . These difficulties were three in number. 1) The lack of opportunities for direct speech, 2) The function of the episode as a prelude to the climax, rather than as an incident described for its own sake, 3) The length and improbabilities of the . I am grateful to Professors Mark Edwards, Michael Nagler and Gregory Nagy for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this study. I owe thanks as well to former colleagues June Amaral, Charles Bab cock and Carl Schlam whose observations and criticisms following a colloquium presentation of this study have contributed to its development.</page><page sequence="2">4 J. M. DUBAN pursuit itself K Bassett concentrated primarily on the use and effectiveness of similes in the episode2. He intended to redress the misdirected efforts of previous scholarship, concerned, in the main, with detecting the original version. Yet it is now possible to say of Bassett's discussion what he had said of his predecessors': excellent as far as it goes . His concern with difficulties and improbabilities brings many relevant observations to light. But as a frame work for his analysis, it tends to divert our attention from the scene which it encloses. While it is true that the pursuit is a narrative of singular variety, its relationship to events that both precede and follow suggests that it is of a special design, one which transcends both the difficulties and improbabili ties of the conventional sort. C. H. Whitman has noted a distortion, or suspension, of time in the epi sode: Homer makes the pursuit seem interminable by inserting, besides the similes where time also stops, the scene where Zeus, in his eternity, is moved to pity and wishes to save Hektor 3. C. R. Beye has similarly noted a distor tion or suspension of distance and space: Book XXII has no spatial reality, it is surrealistic, there being no true distance between the onrushing Achilles, Hektor waiting at the gate, Priam and Hecuba on the wall, and our partici pation in these events 4. The present study intends to show how these distortions combine to pro duce a quite surrealistic effect. Yet to understand the full extent and intention ality of this effect, we must back up to the point where Homer first aban dons naturalism, namely, where Achilles' horses take voice and prophesy his death (17., XIX, 404-417) 5. These same horses had previously wept the death of Patroklos (XVII, 426-440) 6. These are the first in a number of uncanny actions or situations which culminate in the most unreal - if only because so frighteningly real - of them all: the death of Hektor. The humanization of Achilles' horses may be included in what Whit man calls acting images : an announcement of the triumph of the poetic 1 S. E. BASSETT, The Pursuit of Hector, TAPA, LXI (1930), pp. 130-149. 2 Yet Bassett exaggerated the difficulties he perceived in the episode. The similes are neatly cate gorized by W. C. SCOTT, The Oral Nature of the Homeric Simile, Leiden 1974, p. 43: As Hektor awaits the onrushing Achilles there are no fewer than eleven similes describing Hektor, Achilles, or the appear ance of the two. First there are five similes, three for Achilles and two for Hektor. Then four similes de scribing the chase. Finally a simile for Hektor's fruitless lunge and one for the fateful point which will kill Hektor. Exclusive of content the position above emphasizes this expected confrontation (XXII, 22, 26, 93, 132, 134, 139, 162, 189, 199, 308, 317) . Cf. also n. 30, below. For a different treatment see C. MOULTON, Similes in the Homeric Poems, Hypomnemata , Heft 49, G ttingen 1977, pp. 76-87. 3 C. H. WHITMAN, Homer and the Heroic Tradition, Norton, New York 1958, p. 211. 4 C. R. BEYE, The Iliad, the Odyssey and the Epic Tradition, Anchor, New York 1966, p. 152. Beye continues: Like a Greek vase painting where each element is given equal spatial expression, the episode has little sense of perspective. Achilles charging, Priam calling, Hektor waiting, the two men running, the city's turrets crowded with spectators, the Achaian army watching - all are immediately present in the scene . 5 A hint of the surreal to come (C. R. BEYE, The Iliad..., cit., p. 141). M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity and Tradition, A Study in the Oral Art of Homer, University of Calif. 1974, p. 146, notes that both the act and the message reflect the impact on surrounding nature of the hero's own distorted state of mind . We might consider Zeus' shedding tears of blood in anticipation of Sarpedon's death (XVI, 459) as a yet earlier hint of the surreal. 6 See n. 39, below.</page><page sequence="3">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OP HEKTOR 5 scheme over every naturalistic consideration 7. Yet they prophesy to a de humanized Achilles 8. While the others feast, he mourns for Patroklos, and refuses mortal food; he has done with mortality, except for dying, and his sustenance comes from the gods, in the form of a distillation of nectar and ambrosia (XIX, 342-348) 9. Achilles has refused all food, preferring blood and slaughter instead (209-214): 7tptv S' o 7rco av efAotye &lt;p Xov xocT Xaifxov iz r ou n aiq ouSs pcoo~i&lt;;, raipou TS&amp;VYJC TO , ...TO (Jtoi o TI jJLST psoi Tauxa (Ju fjLTjXev, XX &lt;povo TS xal aljia xai pyaXso ar vo vSp&amp;v. And it is in this connection that we should note the closing image of the follow ing book, where Achilles' horses, trampling dead men and shields alike, are compared to oxen crushing barley (XX, 495-499): &lt; S' 8TS TI su ]Q p a pasva supu{AST &gt;7tou&lt;; Tpi sfAsvai xpt Xsoxov S XTI|XSV7) sv Xoyj, pijAcpa TS XSTCT' sysvovTo o&amp;v U7CO 7r oV spi(x xa&gt;v, U7r' 'A^tXX^o (Jisya^ti^ou (JW WUXS tmzo arsi ov (Jiou vsxu TS xal a7tiSa *... More than a near-grotesque pastoral simile 10, it is the imagistic ful fillment of Achilles' inhuman hunger for blood over mortal food. It is a brutal and dehumanized travesty of the civib'zed activity whose product Achilles has foresworn, and is of a kind with his wish before Hektor that my spirit and fury would drive me/to hack your meat away and eat it raw (XXII, 346-347), and with Hecuba's wish to set teeth in the middle of his [Achilles'] liver and eat it (XXIV, 212-213)11. As Achilles arms himself, a clash issues from the grinding of his teeth, and his eyes glow as if on fire (XIX, 365-367): TOO xa OSOVTG&gt;V [x v xava%r) TCXS, T &gt; S ol aas XajjL7rsCT'97)v s TS m&gt;po asXa , sv Ss ol 3)Top S V fc/o OTXTQTOV ... 7 C. R. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 119, speaks of the breakdown in the distinction between action and image in Homer: Since all his action is imagistic, it is no surprise to find on occasion that his images also act. Such passages are bold indeed; a few such as the Iliad's Fight in the River, are unintelligible unless read as acting images. They announce the triumph of the poetic scheme over every naturalistic consideration . 8 A reversal of this type lies embedded in Scamander^ speaking (cf. n. 39, below). M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 151, n. 17, notes that in the background lurks Achilles9 autochthonic connection with thc Spercheios (XXIII, 142-151) and (folk-?) etymological one with the Achel os; thus he is a man with a river genealogy, while Scamander is a river who takes the form and voice of a man . 9 C R.

DUBAN In addition to his abstinence from food and preference for slaughter, the clashing (xava/^) of his teeth provides significant dictional reinforce ment to the notion of the hero's dehumanization. For elsewhere, Homer uses xavax^ of the noises that result from falling or colliding objects, mostly in battle: of spears (XVI, 105), a helmet (794), of wall fortifications struck by missiles (XII, 36)12. The semantic range of xava^v), now transferred to the hero 13, not only dehumanizes him, but suggests his likeness to something of a war machine through his pre-battle resemblance to the sounds of battle he will shortly produce in abundance. In the passage just cited, Achilles is both an auditory and a visual terror. So in the preceding book, when Achilles emits his frightening thrice-repeated cry from the ditch (XVIII, 203-231) 14, Athena makes an awesome flame ra diate from a golden cloud above his head (205-206, 225-227). Both incidents provide vivid anticipation of Achilles, in his fiery aspect, as bearer of the arms which Hephaistos will provide. Whitman has noted the remote references to the flame which will consume Troy (XX, 316-317; XXI, 375-376) and the foreshadowing of the city's doom, subtly associated with Achilles, who is compared to fire in a city (XXI, 522-525) 15. To this we may add the second to-closing image of Iliad XX where Achilles is compared to a wind-lashed forest fire (490-494), for it is as such that he encounters Scamander/Xanthos at the start of the following book. In that book, Homer comes as close as he can to an actual breakdown of the physical world order in describing the zenith of his hero's violence 16. His aristeia is no longer merely that, but becomes a battle of the elements in which the protective river of Troy rises up against the hero and attempts to drown him 17. II - ACHILLES AT THE RIVER: ASCENDANCY AND LIMITATION Achilles arrives at the river as a blast of fire forcing the escape of Trojans (compared to locusts) into the water (XXI, 12-16)18. He jumps in, wreaking 12 Cf. also Od., VI, 82; X, 399 and XIX, 469. At Aspis 164 (~ II, XIX, 365, under discussion), the word is used of serpents' teeth. The entire context is one of fright, panic and slaughter. Only at HH III, 195 does the word designate a pleasant sound, that of Apollo's lyre. 13 C. P. SEGAL, Andromache's Anagnorisis: Formulaic Artistry in Iliad XXII, 437-476, HSCP, LXXV (1971), pp. 43f, makes the same basic argument for XeX x^ XXII, 448) and 7r XXeTat (453). They are words primarily of violence and war, which the poet applies to humans. 14 M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 136, n. 8, notes this as the strongest symbol of its type and traces the progression of shouts which anticipates it. See ibid., 140, n. 15, for illustration in other literatures of the savage, irrationalized implications of Achilles' yell and ibid., 143, n. 17. Note also II, V, 859-861; XIV, 147-152; XX, 48-62 passim, and XXI, 235, 240. 15 See C. H. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 139. For earlier foreshadowings of the flame that will con sume Troy, cf.

His eventual weariness serves only as respite for him to gather and bind the twelve youths he will later slaughter at Patroklos' pyre; the slaughter at hand then resumes (26-33). Two encounters follow, with Lykaon and Asteropaios, each amplifying the symbolic significance of Achilles' encounter with the river. Scamander is Troy's last natural line of defense, the last opportunity for water to extinguish fire. Achilles slays all who take refuge in that defense. Lykaon has escaped from the river (51-52: Ts ps y p iSpox^suyovT' ex TCOTOCJAOU). Achilles spots him stripped of armor, unarmed and fatigued (50-51), and reminds him that the stream will be powerless to protect him (130-133). This episode heightens the inevitability of Achilles' advance on Troy, as Lykaon cannot find escape either within or out of the river. But more than this, Lykaon is the last one we would expect to fall before Achilles, who had previously captured him at Troy and ransomed him at Lemnos (40-48) 19. Achilles' own surprise at seeing him is apparent as he reflects that the main of the grey sea/could not hold him though it holds back many who are unwil ling (58-59). The waters of Ocean and Scamander, then, have shared a joint failure in keeping Lykaon from Achilles 20. The unlikelihood of that failure only emphasizes the inexorability of Achilles' advance: nobody will escape, as Achilles himself announces (103-105). Scamander will fail to protect his own and will himself soon yield to Achilles' fire (372-376). Achilles' subsequent slaying of Asteropaios, grandson of the River Axios, further anticipates his fiery supremacy over the protecting waters of Troy 21. 19 For the theme of the previously captured and ransomed warrior met once again in battle, cf. XI, 101-112. Lykaon is the culmination of all the minor figures in the Iliad who serve as victims for the major characters. Cf. G. STRASBURGER, Die Kleinen K mpfer der Ilias, Frankfurt 1954, p. 85. Cf. also C. R. BEYE, Homeric Battle Narratives and Catalogues, HSCP, LXVIII (1964), pp. 344-372. T. MCFARLAND, Lykaon and Achilles, Yale Review , n. s., XLV (1955-1956), pp. 191-213, eloquent ly argues that Achilles, in slaying Lykaon, inflicts a spiritual death upon himself (207; cf. n. 25, below). The corpse of Achilles, having thrown its soul to the tearing fish [by throwing Lykaon's body to the same], meets Hektor in battle (208). Across the plain of Ilium thrum the wheels of a chariot. Holding the reins is a gold-armored corpse forfeit to Hades.. .the corpse mounts the chariot [each morning] and the soul of Achilles is dragged three times around the pyre of Patroklos (211). M. MUELLER, Knowledge and Delusion in the Iliad, Mosaic , III (1970), pp. 99f, speaks of an interim period for Achilles between the vicarious experience of death (through Patroklos) and death itself. McFarland also notes (ibid., p. 149) the stasis of the Lykaon passage [which] is dependent upon the dynamic of such scenes of battle. Indeed its sculptured quality is precisely the fact that at this point the dynamic becomes static . Elsewhere, a static group cannot be sculptured in the heroic style when the "situation" of the group is static (e. g., Priam ransoming Hektor's body). This observation is particularly noteworthy for the surreal, time and distance distortion for which I argue below in Achilles' pursuit of Hektor. There, the action is interminably drawn out. Here, by way of contrast and prelude, it is frozen. 20 The notion of Scamander's and Ocean's partnership appears at XXI, 122-125 and, more generally, at 196-199. M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 151, notes that the frequent mention of the river's depth, his "deep eddies" (XXI, 15, 239, 603 and 7UOTOC[X a&amp;uSiviqc; five times), and other suggestions of the kind are so many invocations of his genealogical relation to Okeanos (195-197, 211-212) . See ibid., for Scamander as death god and allomorph of the chaos demon, Ocean, and G. NAGY, Phae thon, Sappho's Phaon, and the White Rock of Leukas, HSCP, LXXVII (1973), pp. 148-152, for the asso ciation of Ocean and Eridanos with the theme of transition into the underworld. 21 Especially as it is Scamander himself who inspires Asteropaios to fight Achilles. As with Lykaon, Asteropaios engages Achilles after being in the river (cf. XXI, 144-145).</page><page sequence="6">8 J. M. DUBAN Following this encounter, Achilles bases his challenge to all the waters of the world on the lightning of his ancestor Zeus 22. He has, to some extent, already substantiated that challenge in slaying Lykaon, whom the waters of Ocean and Scamander had failed to protect from Achilles. Yet at the same time that these encounters highlight Achilles' ascendancy, they allow us glimpses of his limitations. Before slaying Lykaon, he acknow ledges the inevitability of his own death (108-112), a thought always in his mind and a leitmotif throughout the poem. But that preoccupation here gains in immediacy as Achilles, in his confrontation with the ambidextrous Aster opaios, receives a flesh wound, the only such incident in the poem (166-168): TO) 8' ETepcp {uv Tcvj^uv niYp $8r v ocXe xzlP $ 8e tTeprj , oruTO 8' a (xoc xeXouvs V 7) 8' unhp OCUTOU yafo) vsoDQpiXTO, XiXaio(x Vy) xpoo aai. This is all we are told, as in the following verse (169), Achilles returns the spear-cast. No mention of pain, no cry; no reaction to or acknowledgment, on the hero's part, of an action which speaks for itself in announcing Achilles' limitations and, ultimately, his mortality. The poet achieves a similar purpose at the end of Book XXI in the scene where Apollo deflects Achilles while the Trojans escape inside the city, and where Homer, though nowhere narrating the death of Achilles, there symbolizes the limits of what Achilles can do23. Achilles' absolute , notes Whitman, like every heroic absolute, finds its telos, or fulfillment, not in dislocating the world as it is, but in self-destruc tion .... The all destructive rage with which he assaults the Trojans is directed in the last analysis upon himself. Like Patroklos, he will have his meeting with Apollo 24. So it is, with the death of Patroklos, that Achilles' own demise be comes a more fully acknowledged and accepted part of his situation than ever before. Thetis reminds him of the decree that his death follows Hektor's (XVIII, 95-96). Achilles is resigned to the fact (98-99, 114-116). Thetis and the Nereids do not so much mourn Patroklos as they do Achilles, though he is still alive (52-64) Achilles' aristeia, since it destroys Hektor, does, in a way, destroy the city 26. At the same time, Achilles' destruction of Hektor is symbolically Achilles' own. As Hektor dies he prophesies Achilles' death (XXII, 356-360). His words, 22 Cf. XXI, 184-199 passim, and CH. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 141. 23 C. H. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 142. 24 Ibid. 25 For the numerous symbolic ways in which Achilles undergoes death in the latter part of the poem, cf. M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 156; J. KAKRIDIS, Homeric Researches, Lund 1949, pp. 66-69, and n. 19, above. C. R. BEYE, Ancient Greek Literature and Society, Anchor, New York 1975, 45f, compares Thetis' cradling Achilles' head (XVIII, 71; cf. also XXIII, 136) to the primal P et , and uses fresh language to recast a familiar idea: Thetis' excessive grief here is an episode taken out of natural narrative sequence. But in a field of action where all is known, and in that sense everything has already happened, the grieving mother at the side of her as-though-he-were-dead son, makes perfect sense. Time has been telescoped . 26 C. H. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 142, who refers to XXII, 410-411 which I discuss in detail in my concluding pages.</page><page sequence="7">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OP HEKTOR 9 as those of a dying man, now portend ultimate fulfillment27. And as Patro klos' prediction has now come to pass in the slaying of Hektor, so will Hektor's in the slaying of Achilles. Moreover, Achilles slays Hektor in Achilles' own armor, that in which Patroklos also fell 28. There are intimations of death-wish and suicide here for which the poet prepares us at XVIII, 32-34, where Anti lochos keeps hold of Achilles' hands in the excess of the latter's grief for Pa troklos. That Hektor now has these arms appears foremost in Achilles' thoughts as he first addresses Thetis. The armor seems intimately connected in Achilles' thought process with a sense of his own mortality and imminent demise (XVIII, 80-90): XX TI [ia T&amp;v ijSo , eral cpiXo Xs V Ta po , ndcTpoxXo , TOV eyco 7cepi TOXVTC V T OV exaipcov, CTOV |X7) xecpaXyj'Tov a7tci&gt;Xeaa, Te xea S' "ExTOp SyjoWa n i vGE, rcsXcopiix, aujia tS aOai, xaX * Ta (x v nY)X9j 0eol S aav yXa S pa ^[xaTt TO) 8TS az poTOu v po jiSaXov e vyj. a ' cpeXe o {Ji v a56t [IET* av Tfl Xlflai vatetv, n-yjXeo S OVYJTYJV ayayeaOai axomv. v v tva xal aol 7r v o vi cppeai [xupi'ov zit) TcatSo a7to 6i(x voLo, TOV OU^ uTO&amp;s|eat auri o xaSe vooryjaavT',. . . Hektor, by slaying Patroklos, forces his own death through Achilles' retaliation; yet Achilles' own death is decreed to follow Hektor's. Hektor, then, is indirectly responsible for killing Achilles, though it be at the cost of his own life. Hektor's responsibility gains symbolic momentum by virtue of his slaying Patroklos in Achilles9 armor. In effect, he slays Achilles in effigy and, through the same symbolism, has Achilles slay himself as he slays Hektor in the same armor. Thus, what Hektor could never do directly to Achilles, he does to his alter-ego or surrogate 29, Patroklos, thereby activating the me chanism for Achilles' own demise. What he could never accomplish in life, Hek 27 M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 145, n. 18, notes that in Homer, prayers given in direct discourse come true unless immediately rejected by the god. 28 .. .Hektor, clad as he is in Achilles' own armor, is a veritable lightning rod in his attractiveness as a focus for the anger of Achilles (T. MCFARLAND, Lykaon..., cit., p. 203). Note also M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 119, n. 12: The motif that another man's armor (esp. a better man's) is fatal best shows the connection of arms with identity; Achilles' old set is fatal both for Patroklos and Hektor . Cf. further ibid., p. 137. For the wearing another's armor theme, see A. E.

DUBAN tor accomplishes by dying, thereby furthering the mechanism of Achilles' death through his own. Hektor, then, has a role in slaying Achilles which, as an overtone, hovers above the only truly audible cadence in the poem, that which sounds Hektor as Achilles' victim. III - THE PURSUER PURSUED With Achilles and Hektor each so intimately connected with the other's death, is it surprising to see in Xanthos/Scamander's pursuit of Achilles a shad ow-play in reverse of Achilles' chasing Hektor? A number of similarities sug gest that this is the case. We may, for instance, compare the imminence of Scamander's overtaking Achilles and that of Achilles' overtaking Hektor (XXI, 263-264 and XXII, 143-144): cb alsl 'AxtXyja xi%r\aaxo xujxa p oio xa Xaw yr Qov eovra*... &amp; &amp;p' 6 y' jujbiejuao &amp;o n rero, Tp ae 8' "ExTcap Te xo Tp x v, aiyrrjQ 8 youva^ evc [xa. Suggestive as well are the contexts immediately preceding these passages. At XXI, 251-256, Achilles is compared to an eagle in flight before the onslaught of the roaring river 30. At XXII, 138-142, Achilles, likened to a screeching hawk, repeatedly lunges at Hektor, compared to a trembling dove. We may note the following correspondences: -IlrjAe rj ' cbt QOvaev 6&lt;rov T' ern Soup pcoiQ, -ateTO o /zar' e^cov {x Xavo , TOU ah)py)T7)po , -8 y &amp; Lcc x pTtcTT re xa oxiaro nererjvov, Tco xox; rj ev, em empeoran 8 x&lt;*^*oV o~fiep8aX ov xov pi ev, naifta roto hao&amp;el - &lt;peuy\ o 8' feiafrs p cov IraTO fxey Xc oqvjJLaydco ~nrjXetSr g ' en QOvae TOCTI xpat7rvot&lt;n nenoibox;. -Y) T xipxo Speatpiv, Xa&lt;pQ Taxo nexerjvcoVy -pYj Sic o f Yjae j^eT Tprjpcova 7i Xeiav, r 8 6' i navda (po elrai, 8' eyy &amp;ev v Xehrjxch - Tap ' natooei, Xeetv Te ak&gt;|x6 aveoyet. 30 This is the only instance where Achilles is afraid and flees (XXI, 254). Likewise, only here does the oder q flee, thus reinforcing the notion of the hunted hunter (252: TOU &lt;87)p7)T7)po ; cf. also XXIV, 316). The eagle usually appears as an omen or bird of prey. In the latter instance it is noteworthy that its prey at XII, 202 is a snake (Sp xovra); at VIII, 248, a fawn (v6 p0v). At XVII, 677 it flushes a hare from the thicket (&amp; {ivc &gt; U7r' (Kpix fic x&lt;XTaxe [XSVO ). Such typical targets of the eagle now converge in the images used of Hektor. At XXII, 93 Hektor is compared to a snake (&lt;*&gt; Sk p xcov) with Achilles as a hawk (139); at XXII, 189-191, to a fawn in the thicket flushed out by Achilles, likened to a dog (ve pov.. .xaT&lt;x7mf)i;a U7r6 &amp; [xv&lt;i)). S. E. BASSETT, The Pursuit..., cit., p. 137, notes that the simile</page><page sequence="9">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OF HEKTOR ll As Scamander appears ever more to engulf Achilles, the latter is likened to a man irrigating a garden.

The comparison indicates that Achilles is in the process of losing the su premacy he had exercised over Scamander by obstructing him with corpses. It is now Scamander who clears his own channel of obstacles by pushing off/the many dead men whom Achilles had killed piled in abundance/in the stream (235-236) 32. Similarly, as Achilles appears ever closer to Hektor, Hektor is likened to a fawn which a hunting dog flushes from shrub to shrub throughout the winding valley and finally overtakes (XXII, 189-192): (5&gt; 8' 6TS vs pov Spsacpi x &lt;ov sX cpoio S YJTOU, paa s v j , 8i T* yxea xal 8i firjooa * TOV 8' et 7isp TS X &amp;flai xaTaTrrf a UTCO &amp; f vq&gt; XX T' avi^vsicov Sisi I(JL7CS8OV, 6&lt;ppa xsv s py) (&amp;q "ExTwp...

The first obstacle in each case is general and encompassing of the hound and the fawn marks the pursuit of Hektor by Achilles as unerring; that of the dream (XXII, 199-200), as ineffectual.. .The application of the first simile gives us our only glimpse into the mind of Hektor during the pursuit, the second introduces the only reference to what was going on in the mind of Achilles . At XXII, 93 Hektor's likeness to a snake about to strike implies the immediate proximity of Achilles (cf. further J. NIEMIRSKA-PLISZCZYNSKA, Analyse Structural du Chant XXII de V Iliad, Eos , LVIII [1969-1970], p. 149). Yet in the distorted spatial dynamics of the episode, Achilles is still some dis tance off (cf. schema p. 18, and n. 2, above). For a somewhat different interpretation of the snake simile see B. FENIK, Stylization and Variety: Four Monologues in the Iliad, in Homer: Tradition and Invention, B. FENIK ed., Leiden 1978, pp. 83f. 31 M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 147, n. 21, views this simile (cf. also XXI, 346-348) and that at XXI, 362-365 (discussed below, p. 14) in a different light: .. .the similes throughout the river fight will provide civilized ("cooked") imagery to balance the hero's savage ("raw") behavior, emphasizing the specific civilizing art of agriculture . Cf. also ibid., p. 153. 32 Achilles has added insult to injury by further obstructing the stream with the uptorn elm he ha d grabbed in desperation, but which Scamander succeeds in sweeping away (XX, 241-246).</page><page sequence="10">12 J.

Moreover, the image of Achilles as gardener is a peace-time image, one which recalls serenity in the midst of panic 33. Both in timing and effect it is similar to the peace-time images (of the hot and cold springs and washing places) in the description of Achilles' chasing Hektor (XXII, 147-158): xpouvo) y txavov xaXXipp ov Iv8a S nr Y&lt;x\ Sotal va aaouai HxapavSpoo Stvr)evTo . f) jt v y p O' USOCTI Xiapco peet, jjupl S XOCTCVO ytyveTai a T j a&gt; el rupo at ofi voio. r S9 et pr O pe 7ipop ei xoia xa^ vj, r xi&amp;vl ^UXP7 ^ 5 SOCTO xpuaTaXXco.

Of primary importance here is the initial description of the two jetting springs of whirling Scamander (XXII, 147-148): 33 W. C. SCOTT, The Oral..., cit., p. 117, discusses the unusualness of the peace similes in a scene of war with reference to Achilles' isolation on the battlefield. 34 The last verse quoted (XXII, 158): Trp cr&amp;e pt v cr#X euye, S oxe M jxtv f y' (xe vcov, is an especially significant link between the two episodes. Achilles, all but overcome by Scamander, wishes that Hektor might slay him instead: A brave man would have been the slayer, as the slain was a brave man (XXI, 280): T &gt; X' ya&amp; jx v &amp;re&lt;pv\ ya&amp; v M xev ev pt e.</page><page sequence="11">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OP HEKTOR 13 xpouv &gt; 8' xocvov xocXXippoov v&amp;oc 8 irr ycd Sotal vataaovai Sxaa vSpou SwTqevro . The same verb is used only six verses above of Achilles' pursuing Hektor (XXII, 142: Tocp * incdaaei), of Hektor's attempting to flee beneath the walls of Troy (XXII, 195: OCVT OV &lt;xt aaSm), and earlier, of Achilles' assaulting Scamander (XXI, 233-234: uiac76j/xp7){Avou arcaicas), of Achilles, likened to an eagle, attempting to flee Scamander (254: TO) xa&gt; YJ ^SV; cf. also 247) and finally succeeding (302-303: TOU S' ^oae yotSvaT' rr^8a/7cp p ov a GOVTO av' &amp; v; cf. also Agenor at 564). By the time we encounter this verb of pursuit and flight at XXII, 148, it is difficult to disassociate it from its pre vious usages. It now designates the peaceful and natural flow of the spring. But that picture, with its attendant elaboration, though it purports to furnish a moment's respite from the foregoing panic, yet keeps that panic before us by means of the loaded verb 35. Further examination suggests something eerie about the two springs in light of all that has preceded (149-152): y {l v y p uSorrt Xtapco peet, ji&lt;pl 8 xa7tvo y yveTai it, a T j et 7tupo al&amp;ouiv.oio* .i) 8' eTepY) &amp; pe Tcpop ei xu a xa^ fl, y x^ vt ^uxpfl. r SOCTO xpuaTr XXc ). The second spring runs half frozen in summer, providing a peculiar, if not unnatural, counterpart to the first, which boils and steams as if on fire from within 36. Does not the latter in its own way recall the fiery Achilles in vading the waters of Scamander, the ultimate elemental conflict between Scamander and Hephaistos (XXI, 33Iff) 37, and within that conflict, Hera's intention (never executed) of supplementing the fire in water below with a whirlwind above, brought in from the ocean, that will burn Trojan corpses and armor alike (335-337)? 35 The aorist participle of aaco is frequently used of dashing goddesses. See F. M. COMBELLACK, Some Formulary Illogicalities in Homer, TAPA, XCVI (1965), pp. 43f, for problems sometimes occasioned by the usage. Combellack's soundest observations center on the concept of speed in the Iliad as conveyed through odaacb. Otherwise, his findings are questionable; cf. e. g. D. YOUNG, Never a Blotted Line? For mula and Premeditation in Homer and Hesiod, Arion , VI (1967), pp. 317f, and C. P. SEGAL, The Theme of the Mutilation of the Corpse in the Iliad, Leiden 1971, p. 45, n. 1. 36 Similarly C. P. SEGAL, The Theme..., cit., p. 43: Hektor's death.. .focuses that general image [of smoke arising from a burning city at XXI, 522-525] on Troy itself (XXII, 411). This progression of similes gives an ominous significance to the description of the springs outside the wall, for the warm spring sends up smoke 44as if a fire were burning" . The springs thus both recall and anticipate, and in either case appear as sinister. 37 This soon precipitates the Theomachia, which is beyond the scope of the present study. Put see G. H. WHITMAN, Homer..., cit., p. 140, for its timing and K. REINHARDT, Die Ilias und Ihr Dichter, G ttingen 1961, pp. 423-450, for excellent discussion of the river fight and Theomachy, their mythic predecessors and relationship to one another within the poem. For the whole of the battle in the river as a massive enlargement of the mutilation theme (the bodies of Lykaon and Asteropaios devoured by fish and eels, etc.), see C. P. SEGAL, The Theme..cit., pp. 30-32.</page><page sequence="12">14 J. H.

Similarly, when Hephaistos has finally burned the corpses, the encircling foliage and then Scamander himself, the last is compared to water in a caul dron boiling with flame beneath (362-365). Finally, we may note that Scamander/Xanthos calls to his brother Simo eis, suggesting that the two of them together may better overcome Achilles (305-323). The call to his brother climaxes his anthropomorphization and is an acting image of a kind with the unnatural speech of the divine horse, Xanthos (the river's namesake, curiously) 39. But beyond its immediate con text, the scene anticipates Athena/Deiphobos' suggesting to Hektor that the two of them together might better overpower Achilles (XXII, 243-246). IV - HEKTOR PURSUED: DISTORTION AND THE SURREAL We earlier noted that Book XXII is surrealistic: it has no spatial reality, there being no true distance between the onrushing Achilles and Hektor. The two appear every bit as far apart as they do close together. For the brief dis tance that separates him from Hektor, Achilles might just as well be miles away; but for that same brief distance, Hektor is as good as caught. There is here an alternating proximity and distance, something of a spooled-out like-toffee effect, a tension and resolution all in one between the imminent expectation of capture and the all but failed hope of escape. Once Hektor realizes he can no longer flee, he considers a long list of alternatives to confronting Achilles (99-130). Hektor's second thoughts are typical of a hero who has shown resolve in the contemplation from a distance of an encounter that is now at hand 40. One such instance is the encounter between Agenor and Achilles at the conclusion of Book XXI (referred to above, p. 8). Given its timing, the role of Achilles, and the overall formal similarities between it and the duel in Book XXII, it will be helpful to consider it as a pre lude to the combat between Hektor and Achilles. The purpose will be to show 38 We may note concerning the &amp;0eXXa at XXI, 335 that, with the sole instance of H., XII, 253 254 (where Zeus raises a dust storm from Mt. Ida), such storms are confined to sea, not brought in from sea on to land. I discuss this exceptional instance in The Whirlwind and the Fight at the River, Eranos (forthcoming). 39 M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., p. 149. Cf. ibid., 148f, for discussion of contexts preceding the utterance which constitute a progression in anthropomorphism to the ultimate emergence of Scamander as a daimon . Thus, the aberrations of nature that accompany the hero's inner turmoil... come about through gradual and consequently plausible escalations . The same is true of Achilles' horses which, as we have seen, first weep, then speak. Cf. also n. 46, below. 40 For examples, see B. FENIK, Typical Battle Scenes in the Iliad, Wiesbaden 1968, pp. 97f. See fur ther B. FENIK, Stylization..., cit., pp. 77-85, for the soliloquies of Agenor and Hektor in relation to other such scenes in the poem.</page><page sequence="13">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OF HEKTOR 15 how the poet uses a traditional format to achieve a quite unexpected efifect 41. Agenor also considers alternatives to confronting Achilles as the latter approaches (XXI, 553-570). In both cases the introductory lines are (XXI, 552 = XXII, 98): x^ora 8' Spa elm izpb v {AsyaXyjTopa &amp;u(i v. The two self-addressed speeches of doubt begin with &amp; poi ycov (XXI, 553 = XXII, 99), followed by a listing of alternatives commencing with the deliberative si JASV XS(V).

My identification of such instances naturally results from a comparison of contexts employing analogous constructions. The method is similar to that used by M. Edwards in identifying cases where the poet is using, altering, or molding his formulaic words or expressions for a particularly literary effect . See Some Stylistic Notes on Iliad XVIII, AJP, LXXXIX (1968), p. 258, and his previous study, Some Fea tures of Homeric Craftsmanship, TAPA, XCVII (1966), pp. 115-179. Similarly, note C. P. Segal's (The Theme..., cit., p. 7) pr cis of M. N. NAGLER, Toward a Generative View of the Oral Formula, TAPA, XCVIII (1967), pp. 269-311 (though Nagler does not speak, as such, of altering formulae): Related, but different situations will realize a form of the parent Gestalt [i.e. one of a number of member formulae in a given formula family], which, in its newness or originality or strangeness or other striking quality will emphasize the uniqueness of the plot situation which called it forth, while still clearly marking the kinship of that situation to those cousin situations to which it is both similar and dissimilar . Segal him self utilizes this methodology in his Andromache's..., cit. (n. 13, above). See ibid., notes 1-4, for additional bibliography and generally, A. HOEKSTRA, Homeric Modifications of Formulaic Prototypes, Amsterdam 1965, and J. B. HAINSWORTH, The Flexibility of the Homeric Formula, Oxford 1968, for studies of the Ho meric formula's far-ranging innovative capabilities.

Xsl fi vsv . . . 6p(zatvs fi vcov . . . In Hektor's case, the reiterative Spjjwctvs and the imperfective participle (Asvcov indicate a lack of finality in his thinking. He is still thinking things over as he awaits Achilles, and then flees; Agenor has reached a decision, awaits Achilles, and remains. Hektor, in fleeing, deviates from the self-questioning Agenor. He indeed submits to the typical decision-making process, and decides to engage Achilles, whatever the outcome. This he does as he awaits Achilles drawing closer (XXII, 92): XX' 6 ye piny' 'A^tX^a 7reX(i&gt;ptov SLCTGOV i vra. There follows another simile emphasizing the fearsomeness of Achilles (131-135). Yet, immediately thereafter, panic seized Hektor when he noticed Achilles, and he went running off (136-137) 43: "ExTopa $\ chg v r aev, Xe Tp fxo * o 8' pr V TXT) au&amp;i fxiveiv, OTZ GC S 7niXa X TO, 9) S (pQ$r &amp;s &lt;;. We might have expected Hektor to engage Achilles as he had decided, and then perhaps flee, feeling himself overpowered. But a novel distinction seems to have been made in describing Achilles' approach in relation to Hek tor's decision-making process-that of seeing Achilles as he draws closer (92: caov t vra) and noticing him (136: cb ev Tjaev) in detail (cf. 132-135) after he has drawn imminently near (131: os ol o^eSov ?)X&amp;e). This added dimension in distance perspective, this time-lapse, is a unique device in distort ing the spatial reality of an action. The following schema will help illustrate the similarity and difference in Achilles' approach as perceived by Agenor and Hektor: 42 Thc encounter between Achilles and Lykaon, discussed above, exhibits a reversal of this pattern. The aggressor is angered, delivers a soliloquy and remains, waiting as the victim draws near (cf. XXI, 53-64). 43 S. E.

It is significant that with Agenor, the episode begins with his noticing Achilles (XXI, 550: G) v Tjasv) and concludes with his re maining to meet him (571: co stawv 'A. Xsl jjiivsv). But with Hektor the process is reversed. The episode begins with his remaining (XXII, 92: [A JAV' 'A. aacrov VTOC) and concludes with his noticing (136: Iv vjasv). This reversal indicates a distortion as well, in this instance, of sequence. That Hek tor's noticing comes at the end is perhaps a well-timed, if not timely, re minder that his awareness of the death he clearly sees for the first time is an awareness late in coming. The stretching of time and distance perspective in the chase itself is re flected through sequence distortion of another kind (XXII, 165 and 208): ) T ) TQ Ilpt [AOlO 7 XlV 7U pt, SlV7)&lt;97]TY)V XX' OTS S ) TO TSrCLQTOV S7TL XpOUVOU &lt;pfot0VT0. For elsewhere in Homer, TO TSTapTOv follows immediately after Tpi . But here, the length of the action implied by Tpi and the emotional value of the intervening action differentiate this from other such instances 44. To the novelty of this separation we may add that of repetition as Hektor repeats Tpi (251) when he finally takes his stand with the disguised Athena and ad dresses Achilles. It is perhaps not accidental that in the Tpi (165) - TO TSTOCpTOv (208) - Tpt (251) sequence the repeated word is equidistant by forty-three verses from its counterpart. The poet distorts, yet does so symetri cally. Another such distortion occurs when Athena/Deiphobos assures Hektor that the two of them together might successfully engage Achilles. Then Hektor, greatly shouting , called to him (294): Aiqicpo ov S' Ix Xsi Xeox amSa [ OLXQ V vaa . Elsewhere when this phrase appears, the reasons for greatly shouting are always the same: the hero shouts either to boast over a fallen opponent or to rally his own companions. He does so greatly to make himself heard above the surrounding noise of battle. Yet here, Hektor shouts for his spear. Moreover, he, Deiphobos and Achilles are the only ones present. There are no armies, no din of battle, and the springs of Scamander where the duel occurs are a considerable distance from the Skaian Gates 45. Instead, Hektor greatly shouts because Deiphobos is no longer near (295): flTs fi.iv S pu jwcxp v S' ou T o yY &amp;sv rjsv. 44 See ibid., p. 142, n. 14, with the following references: II, V, 436-438; XIII, 20; XVI, 702-705, 784-786; XX, 445-447; XXI, 176-177 and Od., XXI, 125-128. 45 As XXII, 145-146 make clear. See S. E. BASSETT, The Pursuit..., cit., pp. 136-140, for discussion of the springs ( not every 7rr yi is by any means a fountain head ), their location (esp. p. 148, n. 20), and the reason for that location ( in Homer no woman ever witnesses the slaying of a warrior who is dear to her ).</page><page sequence="18">20 J. M. DUBAN The circumstances for this shout, though natural enough, are elsewhere without instance. They are another example of what results in the distance distortion through which the episode develops as Deiphobos, who a moment before was close at hand (228: yxou tciTafAsvT]), is now somehow far away, in fact, disappeared. He is, in a way suggestive of the chase itself, at once every bit as near and distant from Hektor at the same time. The exceptional diction, . . . x Xsi . . . (xaxpov aa appears to reinforce this idea. Elsewhere the formula is always (l)x xXsTO {Aocxpov cra 46. The audience might be expec ted to note 1) the change in the traditional verb (the only occurrence of ex Xei in the poem) 47, and 2) the distancing of that form from the rest of the formula. This distancing is, in fact, enhanced by the intervening hapax: . . . x Xsi Xevxaam a fxaxpov aa 48. The diction would thus underscore the parti cular reason for the shout (distance) while the singular subsequent lack of direct discourse would emphasize Deiphobos' absence 49. Such distortion seems the more certain in light of what precedes Hektor's call for help (cf. 273-277). Much wearied, as we may assume, after the chase, Hektor is still perceptive enough to duck and avoid Achilles' spear as he sees it coming (274-275): xai TO (x v avT c l chv yjXe aTO 9ai8i(AO "ExTcop, e sTO y p nqo'Cdcbv, TO 8y u7u p7CT&lt;XTO / Xxsov y^o . His visual acuity is mentioned twice. Yet Athena somehow escapes his notice as she returns Achilles his spear (277): 8' 'AyiXr 8 8ou, A &amp;e ' "EXTOQO, 7tot,[x va Xoc W. Athena's action and Hektor's inattention to it are peculiar because Athena now appears to act in propria persona without any indication that she had, 46 There are two instances where the participle appears without the adverb: x xXeT* uaa (I/., IV, 508 and XXI, 307). In the first case, Apollo is the subject; in the second, Scamander calls to Simoeis. Either's voice would be naturally amplified and require no further qualification. The formula appears in the aorist at the trochaic caesura, with juaxQ v c ae(v) for a hero (e. g. III, 81; V, 347; VIII, 160) but x y *a (re(v) for a god (e.g. XIV, 147; XXI, 328). The singular circumstances of XV, 306ff produce a variation of the latter usage. Apollo, partially wrapped in mist, holds the aegis over the battle, shakes it while staring directly at the Achaians and shouts, greatly indeed :... 7rl 6 OCUT voe, fi Xa fi ya... (321). The result is likewise singular:.. .TOteri Bk &amp;U[A v/ v (mfj^-edatv eA e, Xdc&amp;ovxo Bk ^o piSo aX&gt;aj (32If; &amp;eX e only here). We might account for two atypical usages with reference to the hapax in each verse:... m g Savrog aev (XIII, 409) and...a5ov aev, Qeix jnevo ... (441). 47 The form appears once in the Odyssey at X, 114 and three times (unaugmented) in the same book; cf. 231 = 257 ~ 313. //., XXII, 294: B' Ix Xsi: Leaf; Bk x Xet: OCT. 48 For Virgil's use of the proper name Leucaspis (Aen., VI, 334; the only occurrence in Latin) in rela tion to the Homeric hapax and as anticipation for Aeneas' meeting with Deiphobos (VI, 495ff), see S. V. TRACY, The Nature of Vergilian Allusion: The Fifth Idyll and the Third Eclogue, Humanitas , III (1978), pp. 17f. 49 M. M. WILCOCK, A Companion to the Iliad, Univ, of Chicago 1976, p. 245, notes a strangely dreamlike effect in the conversation between Hektor and Athena/Deiphobos (229-246). As in a dream one may see someone not seen for many years, and one's own mind offers the explanation why he is there, so here, it is Hektor (236-237) who explains the appearance and the apparition agrees . Athena has here deceived in the person of Deiphobos. For Deiphobos himself as accomplice in a curiously similar deceit, see Od., IV, 274ff and esp. 276.</page><page sequence="19">DISTORTION IN PURSUIT OP HEKTOR 21 or was to have, ceased activity as the disguised Deiphobos. Furthermore, when a god wishes to operate unseen among humans, he usually conceals himself in much mist , which Athena nowhere does 50. She simply escapes the notice of Hektor as she returns Achilles his spear. This would seem to indicate that Hektor shifts from states of complete mental awareness to states of complete mental limbo in the development of the episode through the fleeting impres sions and vagaries of dream perception. Following the actual slaying of Hektor (306-366), the scene concludes with an image that prepares us for the laments of Hecuba and Andromache which follow. The lamentation in Troy was (and I translate literally) most similar to that, as if all high-ridged Troy were licked from its height with fire (410-411): T Se ji XioV p* jv evaX yxiov, &gt;q zl arcocaa vIXio 09pu6eaaa 7tupl G[JL Xoito xaT' axpyj . Of course, at the simplest level, this is merely to say that Troy is already weeping its demise, which will be destruction by fire. But this comparison is extraordinary for reasons that transcend its surface meaning. First, the form o&lt;ppu eo~aa51 appears only here and designates something other than eye brow . Yet that meaning is implicit here as well : high-ridged, or high- browed Troy is obliquely likened in lamentation to a weeping eye52. Indeed, o&lt;ppuori appears frequently in formulae which describe weeping, such as OTC' cpp at S xpooc Xei cov (ii., XIII, 88; Od., VIII, 86) or UTC' ocpp ai S xpuov el ev/ov (Od., IV, 153; VIII, 531; XVI, 219). Secondly, we may imagine that the notion of a weeping eye licked by fire (apfyotTO is a hapax) adds to the watered blur resulting from tears, the elasticity of vision as it appears through a curtain of smoke and flame. The image of Troy weeping fiery tears is antici pated by the leap of fiery Achilles into Xanthos, the battle between Xanthos and Hephaistos, the spring of Xanthos which boils as if with a fire from within. The image is thoroughly surrealistic and conveys a double distortion of the reality of what takes place beneath the walls of Troy: the death of Hektor 53. It is an image that conveys the unreal quality of a nation's realization en masse that the death of one man is to be the death of one and all. 50 Gods often assume human disguise or conceal themselves in much mist to operate undetected among mortals. But since Athena is already disguised, additional concealment would appear awkward. However, we might compare the activity of Athena, in propria persona (Book XXII), to her undisguised (= invisible) appearance at 1, 197f. I discuss such instances in Homeric and Hesiodic Concealment in Mist (forthcoming). 51 The dative plural in which p more regularly appears occurs only once else in a context which approximates that of XXII, 411 (XX, 151): ot o Ixlpoxje xoc&amp; ov izy o p ai KaXXtxoXc vTQ . 52 For another aspect of personification in Troy's death, see the excellent^discussion^of Homeric xpif)8e{JLVOV by M. N. NAGLER, Spontaneity..., cit., esp. pp. 52f. 53 The use of composite fire and water in momentous situations is an effective cinema clich . It is used with mastery in Jules Dassin's Phaedra (Greece 1962) in the climactic love-making scene where Melina Mercouri and Anthony Perkins are seen through the double blur of the fireplace and the rain pouring down on the window.</page><page sequence="20">22 J. M. DUBAN The poet suggests a similarly eerie composite prior to the slaying of the suitors where the suitors begin to laugh hysterically for no apparent reason with the jaws of other men/And they were eating meat splattered with blood. Their eyes/filled with tears and their hearts sensed an anguish coming (Od., XX, 347-349) . Theoklymenos begins to interpret this by saying your heads/ And faces are shrouded in night and your knees beneath./ Wailing blazes up, and your cheeks are covered with tears (351-353) : olficoyrj rje, SsS xpuvTai S 7WcpeiaL Stanford notes (ad loc.) the rareness of such synaesthetic imagery in Homer, i.e. describing sound in terms of sight. But more important for our concern is the remarkable parallel which the Odyssey presents to the Iliadic passage under consideration. In the Odyssey, it is the wailing, oc^coyyj, closely associated with tears, that blazes; in the Iliad it is as if in the excess of wailing 54, the eye itself were on fire 55. Moreover, there is an exceptional hesitancy of phrasing in that image: It was most similar to that, as if : TO) Se fx XioV ap' SYJV IvaXiyxiov, cb s . . . Where vaXtyxto /ov appears in comparisons, it most often appears preceded either by a modified noun, e.g.: cnrsp' 07rcopt,v ) IvaX yxLov ... at I/., V, 556, or preceded by &amp;S&amp;/&amp;SO followed by a spondee, e.g.:... &lt;9-s ) vaXiyxio a Svjv at J/., XIX, 250 57. Only here is it preceded by a demonstrative, parti cle and modified verb (TCO SS ( XioV ap' STJV) and followed by a conditional comparison (co el. . .). We have here an expansive form of ob diction, which, in such a simile-studded passage, is particularly useful in bringing attention to this portentous simile 58. The resultant vagueness of wording seems to in dicate some hesitancy over the novelty of, and imagistic preference for, a surreal comparison over the tested mirror's image of comparison reflecting the real world of natural actions. It is the culmination in that series of acting images for which the poet first showed his preference when Achilles' horses wept. Georgia State University 54 XXII, 407: xcoxuasv, 408: Sjico ev, 409: XCOXUTCO, oifxcoyfj. 55 There is an eerie build-up to this scene in the Odyssey, similar, in its way, to the unnatural or sur realistic images and events anticipating Hektor's death in the Iliad. There is an increasing tendency toward laughter for no apparent reason (Od., XVIII, 35, 100, 111, 163, 320, 350; XX, 346, 374, 390; XXI, 105) and light takes on a sinister quality (XVIII, 343-345; XIX, 36-40). In the latter instance, Stanford remarks (ad loc.) that Telemachos notices a supernatural radiance, with almost a touch of clairvoyance , and compares Theoklymenos' perception of a supernatural darkness at XX, 351-357.
