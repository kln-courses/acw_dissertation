<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Peace Research No. 4, Vol. XIII/1976 The Lorenzian Theory of Aggression and Peace Research: A Critique* SAMUEL S. KIM Center of International Studies I'rinceton University P'ractically all the significant theories of war and peace in Western political thought have been postulated either implicitly or explicit- ly on certain images of human nature. The Hobbesian image of man as homo homini lupus - a vicious and cruel animal with no compassion for his fellows - has been shared in varying degrees by St. Augu- stine, Machiavelli, Luther, Malthus, Jona- than Swift, Dean Inge, Spinoza, Bismarck, Freud, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hans Mor- genthau in their attempts to explain societal defects or evils in terms of the allegedly in- nate nastiness in human nature (Waltz, 1959). Even the struggle for power among nations has been explained by some 'realists' in terms of aniimus dominandi, the notion that Homo sapiens, viewed as individuals or as nations, act like beasts of prey, driven by an insatiable lust for power. The contemporary version of Hobbesian- ism is presented, however, in a 'scientific' wrapper. In fact, its most eloquent spokes- man, Konrad Z. Lorenz, is widely recognized as 'the founder of modern ethology' (Eibl- Elibesfeldt and Wickler, 1968: 186). Lorenz's scientific stature has been further enhanced since he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine in 1973. When Sig- mund Freud revised his conception of ag- gression in the aftermath of World War I,1 * This is a revised and expanded version of a paper presented at the 16th Annual Convention of the International Studies Association held in Washington, D. C., February 18-22, 1975. The re- search for this paper was supported by a faculty research grant from Monmouth College. there was little public excitement or even awareness of it. Yet, in recent years many books advancing the instinctive theory of aggression and war - Lorenz's On Aggres- sion (1966) is the most celebrated example - have become run-away best sellers. Evi- dence is growing that the current vogue of Lorenzian ethology is not confined to the reading public. According to one British observer, Lorenz 'has become to aggression what McLuhan is to communications, de Chardin to evolution, Marcuse to revolution' (Clare, 1969:153). Robert Ardrey (1966:302-303), an ardent Lorenzian, argues that 'the human goose is cooked' if Lorenz's book (On Aggression) does not take its place 'among the landmarks of our thought.' For Driver (1967), the Lorenzian ethology promises to be the most objective and valuable of the behavioral sciences. 'The main promise that ethology seems to hold out to students of society and politics', observed Willhoite (1971: 619), 'is the possibility of developing a scientifically defensible conception of man's nature.' Like- wise, Tiger (1969: 59) argues that 'the ap- proach of ethologists - if not ethology it- self - must 'become part of the repertoire of any serious student of human behaviour.' Some political scientists in the United States, without necessarily accepting the Lo- renzian concept of human behavior in toto, have already begun pleading for greater re- ceptivity to a biologically based approach. Somit (1968) calls for 'a more biologically oriented political science', while Corning (1971) advances a bold proposal that 'evolu-</page><page sequence="2">254 Samuel S. Kim tion be employed as a general theory to ex- plain all human life, including political life'. Thorson (1970: 82) also argues in an atten- tion-capturing book, Biopolitics, that con- temporary political science should adopt a new paradigm that would consider man as 'above all, a biological organism', who 'is what he is because of and through the pro- cess of biological and cultural evolution'. On the other hand, Alcock (1972:2) of the Canadian Peace Research Institute, while admitting that 'the scientific investigation of war has not yet found its Galileo or New- ton', nonetheless cites Lorenz along with Quincy Wright, Lewis Richardson, and Sig- mund Freud as 'early predecessors' in peace research and then asserts that 'they have all shown that there could be a science of peace'.2 If accepted without critical scrutiny, the application of the Lorenzian theory to the social sciences in general and to peace re- search in particular can be misleading and even dangerous. This paper challenges the Lorenzian theory on conceptual, methodol- ogical, and substantive grounds and draws up some broad policy implications for peace research. However, a few caveats are in or- der at the outset. The present critique should not be regarded as an apology for anti- evolutionary approaches in the social sci- ences. Nor should it be regarded as an in- stance of parochial resistance to cross-dis- ciplinary approaches in peace research or as a traditional opposition to 'scientific' meth- od in political science. Rather, it is predi- cated on the belief that indiscriminate cross- fertilization can be of little heuristic value to the advancement of peace research as a value-oriented policy science.3 The Lorenzian Theory The core of the Lorenzian theory of human and animal behavior is the assertion that 'aggression' - defined as 'the fighting in- stinct in beast and man which is directed against members of the same species (Lorenz, 1966: ix) - is phylogenetically programmed and, therefore, ineradicably instinctive be- havior. Aggression is not a learned reaction to social cues or environmental stimuli but a species-specific instinct man has inherited from his anthropoid ancestors in the service of evolutionary adaptation and survival. All the amazing paradoxes of human history would somehow fall into place, Lorenz would have us believe, 'like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, if one assumes that human behavior, and particularly human social be- havior, far from being determined by reason and cultural tradition alone, is still subject to all the laws prevailing in all phylogeneti- cally adapted instinctive behavior' (1966: 237; see also 1970: xii). In his enthusiasm for the popularization of ethology, Lorenz (1966: 29) conveys the impression that this con- ceptual net can stretch so far and wide as to cover 'the alarming progression of aggressive actions ranging from cocks fighting in the barnyard to dogs biting each other, boys thrashing each other, young men 'throwing beer mugs at each other's heads, and so on to bar-room brawls about politics, and final- ly to wars and atom bombs'. In order to make the ambiguous concept of 'instinct' integral to his theory of human and animal behavior, Lorenz ha's reified it. Closely following the formulation of Tin- bergen (1951), Lorenz views instinctive acts as rigidly stereotyped innate movements ('fixed action patterns') which are coordi- nated in the central nervous system. Lorenz flatly asserts that 'the motor co-ordination patterns of the instinctive behaviour pattern are hereditarily determined down to the finest detail' (1970: 313). Instinctive acts are thus neurophysiologically motivated and re- leased in t'he internal system of the organism - 'a virtually close system' in Lorenz's (1970: 323) own words - quite independent- ly of the animal's experience and environ- ment.4 Ano'ther salient feature of the Lorenzian theory is its insistence on the spontaneity of aggression. Like other theorists of instinct - Craig (1918), McDougall (1923), Freud</page><page sequence="3">The Lorenzian Theory 255 (Fromm, 1973), Tinbergen (1942), Storr (1970), and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972) - Lorenz also conceptualizes the progress of aggres- sive behavior as a sort of hydraulic mecha- nism analogous to the pressure generated by dammed-up water in a closed container. According to this hydraulic process - also referred to as an energy model of motiva- tion - action-specific energy spontaneous- ly accumulates in the instinct center of the animal, generating pressure for its dis- charge with rhythmic regularity. Sometimes, the organism does not even wait passive- ly for the release of its aggressive energy, but actively seeks stimuli. The more ex- tensive the period during which the ag- gressive energy is dammed up - or the more extensive the period during which an in- stinctive behavior pattern is passive - the lower the threshold value of its elicitory stimulus. 'Following a more or less extensive period of 'damming',' Lorenz asserted, 'the entire motor sequence can be performed without demonstrable operation of an ex- ternal stimulus' (1970: 320; italics in the original; see also 1966: 52-53). Lorenz has advocated the concept of spon- taneous aggression with conviction and con- sistency. 'There cannot be any doubt, in the opinion of any biologically minded scien- tist', he (1964: 49) asserted, 'that intraspecific aggression is, in Man, just as much of a spontaneous instinctive drive as in most other vertebrates'. In an interview in 1974, Lorenz reaffirmed his belief in the concept of spontaneous aggression: 'I'm convinced of it [spontaneous aggression]. I cannot prove it in man. I can prove that in certain ani- mals aggressivity follows all the rules of threshold-lowering and appetitive behavior. You can see an animal looking for trouble, and a man can do that too' (Evans, 1974: 90). The Lorenzians view aggression as indis- pensable not only for the survival of the in- dividual and the species but also for the achievement of creative human endeavors. For example, Lorenz (1966: 48) asserts - and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972), Storr (1970), and Tiger (1970) share this view - that 'aggres- sion, far from being the diabolical, destruc- tive principle that classical psychoanalysis makes it out to be, is really an essential part of the life preserving organization of in- stincts'. While Freud (1968) viewed the death in- stinct as being opposed by the instinct of Eros, Lorenz (1964, 1966) holds, as does Storr (1970), that aggression in man is 'an essential component of personal friendship'.5 The Lorenzians also assert that, without ag- gression, nearly everything man does would somehow lose its creative and intellectual vigor. 'Aggression is related to mastery', as- serts Tiger (1970: 216). For Storr (1970), ag- gression is the basis of intellectual achieve- ment. 'Our ordinary speech expresses the fact', observes Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972: 84), 'that even culturally creative achievements are nourished by aggression'. And Lorenz (1966: 278) too asserts that aggression is in- deed 'indispensable for the achievement of the highest human goals'. Lorenz fully agrees with Freud (1962, 1968) that the failure to discharge aggression is quite unhealthy. Just as Freud has postu- lated in the pre-World War I period that repression of sexuality could lead to mental illness and later applied the same argument to the death instinct, Lorenz (1966: 243) also argues that 'present-day civilized man suf- fers from insufficient discharge of his ag- gressive drive'. In support of his argument, Lorenz (1966: 244) cites Ute Indians who 'suffer more frequently from neurosis than any other human group' because of undis- charged aggression. As a result of 'a devas- tating hypertrophy of aggression in the Utes', Lorenz (1966: 245, 298) further argues that they are the most accident-prone and unhappy of all peoples. That the discharge of aggression is a healthy and normal pro- cess can also be discerned in Lorenz's (1970: 99) assertion that 'any physical defect (how- ever small) is accompanied by pronounced disruption of the instinctive behavioural system'. Since the establishment of an ecological</page><page sequence="4">256 Samuel S. Kim balance between population and landlre- sources is viewed by the Lorenzians as the most important survival function of intra- specific aggression, the Lorenzian theory be- comes closely tied to the concept of terri- torial behavior. Lorenz concurs with Tin- bergen (1968) that man behaves very much like a territorial species. Lorenz (1966) also agrees with the judgment of such authors as Calhoun (1961, 1962) and Leyhausen (1965) that high population density always leads to an increase in aggressive behavior in both humans and animals. Attacking Marx for his 'errors of forget- ting the instincts', Lorenz flatly declares: 'But it's almost always overpopulation that is at the root of all the 'malfunctions' of human social behavior' (de Towarnicki, 1970: 29). 'When thousands, millions, of men are brought together', Lorenz continues, 'ag- gression begins to get seriously out of hand' (de Towarnicki, 1970: 29). One of the major reasons for mounting aggression today 'is quite simply that men in large cities are too crowded together'. Tellingly, Lorenz men- tions - at least in two separate interviews - the bus terminal on 42nd street in New York City as prima facie evidence for his conten- tion that crowding causes hostility and ag- gression (de Towarnicki, 1970: 29; Evans, 1974: 85). Intra-specific aggression is seldom dan- gerous among the animals, the Lorenzians contend, because of the development of so- called threat behavior. However, man has failed to develop innate inhibitory mecha- nisms of diverting or ritualizing maladap- tive aggression because he lacks major mor- phological weapons. The fate of humanity is now in a precarious situation, Lorenz argues, because of the growing tension between the spontaneous and instinctive drive for aggres- sive behavior and the destructive capability of remote control nuclear weapons. Further- more, 'anonymity of the person to be at- tacked greatly facilitates the releasing of ag- gressive behavior' (Lorenz, 1966: 283). Lo- renz wonders whether 'responsible morality' will be able to cope with such a rapidly growing burden of modern civilization. Following James (1968) and Freud (1968), Lorenz finally proposes the ancient Greek conception of catharsis as the solution - that is, aggression can be - and should be - sublimated, redirected or ritualized. This Lorenzian thesis is based on the assumption that human nature cannot be changed and the belief that aggressive drives cannot be suppressed but only diverted. The concept of catharsis refers specifically to a discharge of energy following an aggressive response, the process of which will in turn reduce the probability of any subsequent aggressive be- havior. Even though his cathartic thesis is derived largely from the observations of dis- placement activities of cichlids and birds, Lorenz (1964:45; 1971:21) is convinced that human beings too exhibit many examples of cathartic process. In a manner suggestive of James' (1968) 'moral equivalent of war', the Lorenzians all propose competitive games, academic or artistic masteries, and cultural activities as cathartic outlets for discharging aggressive drives of individuals and nation-states (Lo- renz, 1966; Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1972; Storr, 1970). Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1972: 77) asserts that one can drain off aggressive energy by watching a film with aggressive content Lorenz (1966: 287) argues, on the other hand, that sport functions as 'a healthy safety valve for that most indispensable and, at the same time, most dangerous form of aggres- sion' which he characterizes as 'collective militant enthusiasm'.6 Sporting contests, in addition to providing an outlet for the col- lective militant enthusiasm of nations, have two additional effects that counter the dan- ger of war: 'they promote personal ac- quaintance between people of different na- tions or parties and they unite, in enthusi- asm for a common cause, people who other- wise would have little in common' (Lorenz, 1966: 282). Conceptual Critique One obvious conceptual problem with the</page><page sequence="5">7he Lorenzian Theory 257 Lorenzian theory lies in the cavalier use of key terms that are not given an operational definition. To define aggression, as Lorenz does, as the intraspecif'ic fighting instinct in beast and man simplifies the task of popu- larizing ethological thinking, to be sure. However, such a reductionism can hardly be achieved without emasculating the heuristic value of the concept. Like the doctrine of Original Sin, the Lorenzian view of aggres- sion is a general, monocausal, and monoex- planatory proposition which is not suscep- tible to empirical verification in most con- texts of human behavior. Moreover, such key terms as aggression, violence, and war are not only used interchangeably, but also as common referents for the aggressive be- havior of both animals and humans at all levels of organic, social, and ecological or- ganization. As the following discussion will show, Lorenz's propensity for anecdotal rea- soning in support of his argument is a corol- lary of his zeal to popularize his theory of aggression. The Lorenzians constantly speak of 'in- stinctive' behavior as if the import and the scope of this category of behavior were self- evident. The reification of the concept of instinct does not necessarily establish its heuristic value. Clinical and laboratory ex- periments in recent years have shown that the dichotomy between instinct and learning is misleading. It is not possible completely to exclude learning from early ontogenetic processes in the egg or in utero. Apparently even 'instinctive' behaviors operate against a complex tangle of interaction which in- cludes other genes as well as the influence of the external environment. Hence the con- cept of instinct has now become passe as more and more students of behavior have abandoned use of the concept as outmoded (Alland, 1969; Barnett, 1973; Scott, 1973).7 To operationalize the concept of aggres- sion is an extremely complex and hazardous task. The Lorenzian definition seems to have taken a conceptual short-cut by merging ag- gression with instinct. However, such a sim- plistic reductionism has been achieved by relegating many relevant questions to limbo. For example, does the intraspecific fighting instinct cover the attitudinal (the latent) as- pect as well as the behavioral (the manifest) aspect? To concentrate exclusively on the overt act alone would shed little light on the motivational state of the actor. On the other hand, the state of anger and frustra- tion alone could not explain the form of its final expression. A special methodological caution is needed here to avoid equating the cause with the outcome of behavior. From the standpoint of peace research, however, the most troubling aspect of the Lorenzian definition of human aggression is its weakness in dealing with institutionalized aggression - the injury, harm, and vio- lence indirectly inflicted upon one group of individuals by another group of individuals through institutions and structures of so- ciety, or what Galtung (1969) terms 'struc- tural violence'. The irony is that the greater the capability an actor possesses in terms of such coercive weapons as position, wealth, persuasive skills, and the like, the greater the probability that his 'aggression' will be expressed in an indirect institutional or structural form rather than in a direct per- sonal/physical form. Even the widely accepted (non-Lorenzian) definition of aggression as 'any behavior whose goal is the injury of some person or thing' (Berkowitz, 1968a: 168) raises the con- ceptual problem of attribution of intent. Strictly speaking, intent is not a behavioral attribute but a circumstantial inference de- duced from any behavioral pattern which is, or appears to be, nonaccidental. This raises an interesting conceptual problem. Is an actor who attempts to injure some person or object seriously, but fails, as 'aggressive' as an actor who unintentionally injures some person or thing? Clearly, lack of consensus on the extent of attribution of intent re- mains a major obstacle in operationalizing the concept of aggression. To compound the conceptual problem, the determination of intent in 'aggressive' be- havior is subject to perceptual and judge-</page><page sequence="6">258 Samuel S. Kim mental distortions. Just as sociological real- ity is what people perceive or expect it to be (Allport, 1950; Merton, 1957), aggression too becomes a mirror image of each obser- ver's belief system. Even a cursory observa- tion of UN politics would show that aggres- sion in the context of contemporary inter- national politics means different things to different people. Culture and politics have shaped our perceptual apparatus to such an extent that even trained observers are not immune from projecting their own images onto 'aggressive' behavior. That both the status and image of the ac- tor and the values and perspective of the observer seriously complicate the concep- tualization of aggression can no longer be ETIOLOGICAL VARIABLES: An Innate Drive; An Inborn Reaction to Frustration; A Learned Response INTRA-SPECIFIC INTER-SPECIFIC (hunting) EXTRA-SPECIFIC (property) doubted. Most Americans use a double stan- dard in judging 'violent' behaviors of the police and student demonstrators (Blumen- thal et al., 1971). Another empirical study suggests that 'the actor must have no physi- cal characteristics, such as clothing, beard, long hair, color, stigmata, and the like, that could affect the labeling process apart from the act itself' (Tedeschi et al., 1974: 557-558). Similarly, a cross-cultural study of aggres- sion shows a meaninglessness of describing one culture more or less aggressive than an- other given the difficulty of establishing a value-free external criterion of evaluation (Green and Santori, 1969). In short, the clas- sification process raises two difficulties: the conceptual problem of separating the objec- SYSTEMIC LEVELS: Interpersonal (crime, sui- cide or homnocidc) Intergroup (riot, revolu- tion or civil war) International (war) LABELING VARIABLIES: Status of Actor; Values of Observer ANGRY INSTRUMENTAL DIRECT F INDIRECT J ACTIVE | I PASSIVE r | LEGITIMIZED ILLEGITIMIZED PHYSICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL -- HUMAN - AGGRESSION INTENTIONAL ACCIDENTAL PERSONALIZED INSTITU'TIONALIZED WITH- OBJECT WIll-lOUT OBJECT ATTITUDINAL (Latent) BEIHAVIORAI, (Manifest) ADAPIVE MALADAPTIVE</page><page sequence="7">The Lorenzian Theory 259 tive reality of human behavior from the subjective assessment of the observer and the problem of separating the perspective of the actor from that of the observer. However, animal aggression is relatively easy to observe and classify without such conceptual problems because of a limited number of natural weapons and a definable range of threat instruments. Animal aggres- sion is also direct and physical and almost never accidental, occurring within a specific situational context in which the cause of con- flict is rather obvious (Tedeschi, et al., 1974; Washburn and Hamburg, 1973). However, human aggression involving our natural mor- phological equipment constitutes a small portion of the total inventory of human ag- gressive behaviors. The fact that there are different sources, contexts, stimuli, dimensions, instruments, expressions, and effects of aggression now seems to be indisputable. Yet Lorenz (1958: 3) tenaciously adheres to the assumption that 'beneath all the variations of individual be- havior there lies an inner structure of in- herited behavior which characterizes all the members of a given species, genus or larger taxonomic group'. To Lorenz and his fol- lowers, who view aggression as a hydraulic process in which energy rhythmically ac- cumulates and discharges, all the conceptual problems raised in the preceding pages are largely irrelevant. However, any monocausal and monoexplanatory model such as Lo- renz's cannot account for all aggressive be- haviors. Moreover, neuro-physiological de- terminism embodied in the Lorenzian con- ceptualization ignores the socio-political structure of situations in which aggression finds its final expression. That the heuristic utility of the Lorenzian concept of aggression is limited is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 1 above, which shows variables as- sociated with typology of human aggression. Aethr)odological Critique Independent of its conceptual difficulties and substantive weaknesses, the Lorenzian approach to aggression and war is flawed on methodological grounds alone. This is due to Lorenz's recurrent tendency to stray be- yond the boundary of well-established sci- entific standards and procedures. Instead of the formulation of operational hypotheses that can be empirically verified, or the de- velopment of theses based on evidence, one finds an unrestrained mixture of metaphori- cal reasoning and dogmatic conviction, a pervasive confusion of analogy and homol. gy, and an unabashed exercise in cross-spe- cies extrapolation and long inductive leaps. Most important, Lorenz fails to construct a relevant or testable paradigm for the study of war. Invoking the authority of the Darwinian axiom that 'we have a common origin with animals', Lorenz has wedded conceptually all kinds of animal and human behaviors based on superficial and semantic anthro- pomorphic comparisons. Thus, 'all human rights have originated in a natural way, largely analogous to the evolution of social instincts in animals and man' (Lorenz, 1966: 84), while the urge for group membership has been 'programmed in the pre-human phylogeny of man' (Lorenz, 1966: 265). 'Like the triumph ceremony of greylag goose', Lorenz (1966: 271) further extrapolates, 'mil- itant enthusiasm in man is a true autono- mous instinct: it has its own appetitive be- havior, its own releasing mechanisms, and, like the sexual urge or any other strong in- stinct, it engenders a specific feeling of in- tense satisfaction'. In a 1940 paper entitled, 'Durch Domestikation verursachte Storun- gen arteigenen Verhaltens', Lorenz even equated the effects of civilization in human beings with the effects of domestication in animals (Lehrman, 1953: 354). Lorenz and Ardrey are excessively free- wheeling in their use of intra-specific and inter-specific extrapolations. They habitual- ly commit an anthropomorphic fallacy by describing animal behavior in human terms; they also reverse the process by describing human behavior in ethological terms. The ease with which they transfer observations of animal behavior into socio-political judg-</page><page sequence="8">260 Samuel S. Kim ments about human beings contains far more of imaginative fantasy and magic label than of solid empirical observation and analysis. Lorenz (1966:217) is so convinced of his analogies between the social behavior pat- terns of wild geese and man that 'all the truisms in our proverbs seem to apply equal- ly to geese'; also the ritualized fighting of many vertebrates is 'an impressive example of behavior analogous to human morality' (Lorenz, 1966: 110). Consider 'the repeated argument of the Lorenzians that aggressive behavior of con- temporary man - and his nation-states, too - can be understood only in terms of his phylogenetically programmed instinct, and that such an instinctual endowment can only be learned from animal studies. This argu- ment 'solves' the level-of-analysis problem by using one simple methodological linkage. As already discussed, the Lorenzian concept of aggression is difficult to employ at the systemic levels of large groups, nation- states, and the international system; hence, its methodological value for macro-psychol- ogy, macro-sociology, macro-economics, and macro-politics - all of which are indis- pensable disciplines for peace research - is severely limited. By lumping together many different kinds and levels of behavior on the basis of phenotypic resemblances, however, the Lorenzians make a multi-level linkage. According to the Lorenzian methodology of 'inductively determined facts'8 therefore, the cause of aggression in birds and fish is essentially the same as the cause of animal aggression (an intraspecific inductive leap),9 just as the cause of animal aggression is essentially the same as the cause of human individual aggression (an inter-specific in- ductive leap).10 Likewise, the cause of in- dividual aggression is essentially the same as the cause of group aggression (an intra-spe- cific inductive leap), just as the cause of group aggression is essentially the same as the cause of international aggression (the final inductive leap). It is indeed puzzling that a world-renowed scientist is so contemptuous of experimental research and so fond of impressionistic anec- dotes and analogic word play.1'l Lorenz (1971: xix) candidly admits that he is 'a very poor experimenter' but argues that 'induc- tion, the fundamental cognitive process of all science, which consists in the abstraction of a general law out of the observation of many special cases in which it prevails, is not absolutely dependent on the experiment' [italics in the original]. Likewise, he deplores the popularity of quantitative methods in science (Lorenz, 1971:1). True, as a lifetime student and founder of modern ethology, Lorenz commands an encyclopedic know- ledge of animal behavior. But his research stops short at Homo sapiens, for he has largely disregarded hundreds of relevant studies on human behavior in psychology, sociology, anthropology, social psychology, history, and political science. Yet, the two volume collection of Lorenz's lifetime work, published by Harvard University Press (Lo- renz, 1970; 1971), carries the misleading title, Studies in Animal and Human Behav- ior, exemplifying his persistent propensity to advance arguments and claims far beyond available research or evidence. There is very little about human behavior in the two vol- umes, but obviously Lorenz is convinced that he has already learned from birds and fish everything that can be learned about human behavior.12 Furthermore, in all the writings of Lorenz (1958, 1964, 1966, 1966, 1970, 1971; Lehr- man, 1953) this writer has consulted, there is little reference to the growing literature of peace research including the well-known classics by Wright (1965) and Richardson (1960a, 1960b).13 Instead, sources of 'evi- dence' or 'proof' of his observations of hu- man aggression come exclusively from casual anecdotes. Just as the New York bus termi- nal is used as an 'analogic proof' of his con- tention that crowding causes hostility and aggression, so his aunt's behavior is pre- sented as an 'anecdotal proof' of spontane- ous human aggression. This anecdote merits a full citation, however, because it repre-</page><page sequence="9">The Lorenzian theory 261 sents a typical example of Lorenz's analogic reasoning: Analogous behavior can be observed in human beings. In the good old days when there was still a Habsburg monarchy and there were still do- mnestic servants, I used to observe the following, regularly predictable behavior in my widowed aunt. She never kept a maid longer than eight to ten months. She was always delighted with a new servant, praised her to the skies, and swore that she had at last found the right one. In the course of the next few months her judgment cooled, she found small faults, then bigger ones, and toward the end of the stated period she discovered hate- ful qualities in the poor girl, who was finally dis- charged without a reference after a violent quar- rel. After this explosion the old lady was once more prepared to find a perfect angel in her next employee. It is not nmy intention to poke fun at my long- deceased and devoted aunt. I was able, or rather obliged, to observe exactly the same phenomenon in serious, self-controlled men, myself included, once when I was a prisoner of war. So-called polar disease, also known as expendition choler, attacks small groups of men who are completely dependent on one another and are thus pre- vented from quarreling with strangers or people outside their own circle of friends. From this it will be clear that the damming up of aggression will be the more dangerous, the better the mem- bers of the group know, understand, and like each other. In such a situation, as I know from personal experience, all aggression and intra-specific fight behavior undergo an extreme lowering of their threshold values. Subjectively this is expressed by the fact that one reacts to small mannerisms of one's best friends - such as the way in which they clear their throats or sneeze - in a way that would normally be adequate only if one had been hit by a drunkard (Lorenz, 1966: 55). To be sure, this kind of anecdote is con- venient and even useful in explaining - and popularizing - to the uninitiated the Lo- renzian analysis of spontaneous and hydrau- lic process of aggression. But it can hardly be used as supporting evidence of the con- troversial concept. Lorenz makes no attempt to ascertain whether his aunt's behavior, or his own as a prisoner of war, is common to all men in all societies at all times. Heuris- tically, the anecdote is of little use because it has not been tested to meet the scientific standards of comparability in time and space. The biological potential of man does not ipso facto explain human behavior any more than one's IQ could predict its ultimate effect or outcome. The final expression of any biological potential, whether it be so- matic or behavioral, depends largely on the ontogenetic history of an organism. Group aggression involves a complex chain of sev- eral behavioral components that cannot be treated as a uniform phenomenon. From the standpoint of peace research, therefore, it is more relevant to ask why some men, some groups, some culures, and some nations are prone to violent behavior, and why others are peaceful, rather than to seek universal truth about man's nature. Despite the modicum of his own research on human behavior or even reliance on the research of other students of human behav- ior, Lorenz advances sweeping pronounce- ments with the conviction of a man who has discovered the Truth. Repeatedly, he couches his argument in dogmatic terms, as if invok- ing the authority of Darwin would be suffi- cient to settle the issue. 'To the humble [?] seeker of biological truth', he (1966: 270) says, for example, 'there cannot be the slightest doubt than human militant enthu- siasm evolved out of a communal defense response of our prehuman ancestors' [italics added]. Similarly, 'there cannot be any doubt, in the opinion of any biologically minded scientist that intraspeficic aggression is, in Man, just as much of a spontaneous in- stinctive drive as in most other vertebrates' (Lorenz, 1964: 49; italics added). On the other hand, critics of Lorenzian ethology are branded as anti-evolutionists if they point out discontinuities between ani- mal and human behaviors, as fools who, hav- ing been influenced by the behavioralists (referring to American psychologists), refuse to admit that their own behavior obeys the laws of nature, or as followers of the dan- gerous American doctrine of equality if they believe in the malleability of human nature (Lorenz, 1965; 1966; 1970; 1971; de Towar- nicki, 1970). Asserting that he has something to teach mankind, Lorenz finally concludes On Aggression with a prophetic message: 'I</page><page sequence="10">262 Samuel S. Kim am really being far from presumptuous when I profess my conviction that in the very near future not only scientists, but the majority of tolerably intelligent people, will consider as an obvious and banal truth all that has been said in this book about instincts in general and intra-specific aggression in particular, about the factors that build up the ever-in- creasing danger of human society's becom- ing completely disintegrated by the misfunc- tioning of social behavior patterns' (1966: 276).14 Substantive Critique Of the three alternative theories explaining the causation of aggressive behavior (biolog- ical-instinctual, response to frustration, and socio-cultural learning), the substantive evi- dence in support of the Lorenzian theory of biological-instinctual determinism is weakest. A growing body of experimental/empirical literature in the social and behavioral sci- ences, including peace research, does not lend credence to the monocausal paradigm advanced by Lorenz and his followers. Ag- gressive behavior seems to be shaped by a plastic process involving an interwoven com- plex of internal, external, and experiential factors. Reflecting man's unique capability to expand and diversify his behavioral re- pertoire, human aggressive behavior expres- ses itself in a myriad of ways. There seems to be a discernible divergence, however, be- tween the Lorenzan theory and human ag- gression and/or war: the higher one ascends on the phylogenetic scale in the animal king- dom, the farther one moves up the ladder of systemic levels of human behavior, the closer one reaches the core area of peace research, the more limited and insubstantial is the evidence supporting the Lorenzian theory. Evidence for Animal Aggression The lay public innocently assumes that Lo- renz speaks for all students of animal be- havior. Many of the social science critics have also accepted Lorenz's interpretation of animal behavior uncritically, even though they reject its application to humans (Bar- nett, 1973; Berkowitz, 1973; Nelson, 1974). True, Lorenz stands on firmer ground in animal research. But his interpretation is not shared by all ethologists. In fact, his severe critics - S. A. Barnett, Sally Carrighar, J. H. Crook, Robert A. Hinde, J. P. Hailman, Daniel Lehrman, K. E. Moyer, T. C. Schneir- la, J. P. Scott, and Willian Tavolga - have been his fellow professionals in animal be- havior and closely related fields. Rejecting the nearly unanimous view of non-ethologi- cal reviewers that Lorenz at least speaks authoritatively and reliably on animal be- havior, one ethologist says that 'On Agres- sion does not in fact represent the methods or opinions current in ethology' (Barnett, 1973: 75-76). Because of space limitations, this discussion is confined to a few illustra- tive examples of the salient substantive weaknesses in the Lorenzian theory of ani- mal and human behavior with emphasis on aggression. There is now increasing evidence in ex- perimental literature on animal research that Lorenz has committed a double error. First, he oversimplifies the instinctive behav- ior of lower animals. Then, he overextra- polates 'from lower animals to animals high on the phylogenetic scale. In the interest of the completeness and the simplicity of his paradigm, Lorenz has considerably over- looked both phylogenetic and ontogenetic differences among various species. There ap- pears to be no single instigation to aggres- sion even among the lower animals. Instead, there are several kinds of aggression, the actual patterns of which differ from species to species. The concept of prefixed innate behavior is also unsatisfactory because of the blurring line between developmental causation and hereditary causation. The straight-line rela- tionship between gene and somatic charac- teristics is misleading since the organism is different at each different stage of its devel- opment (Lehman, 1953: 346-347). Moreover, an experiment centering on the feeding be- havior of sea gull chicks shows that 'behav- ioral development is a mosaic created by</page><page sequence="11">The Lorezianz Theory 263 continuing interactions of the developing or- ganism and its environment' (Hailman, 1969: 106). As we climb the evolutionary tree from lower animals to higher animals such as pri- mates, which are closely related to man, ag- gressive behavior generally becomes less common. When it does occur, however, its causes are more complex, more numerous, less rigidly programmed by the genotype, and more influenced by ecological and ex- periential factors. Lorenz's characterization of primates as 'irascible' does not seem to receive firm support from many primatolo- gists who believe that the primates, especial- ly chimps, are on the whole peaceful and co- operative in their undisturbed natural en- vironment, apart from the usual kinds of threat display.15 To say that aggressive behavior is rare and rather insignificant in the behavior of primates in their natural habitats is not to deny the fact that they can become aggres- sive under certain conditions. However, there are different causal variables of ani- mal aggression. The heritability of aggres- siveness in dogs and leghorn chickens has been demonstrated through selective breed- ing (Corning, 1973). It is also argued that frustration is as much a source of aggres- sion in animals as it is in children and adults (Berkowitz, 1968b; Durbin and Bowl- by, 1968). The social conditions of rearing are also believed to influence the probability of aggression in 'intra-species encounters in mice, cats, dogs, monkeys, and other ani- mals' (Hinde, 1973: 99). Despite the differ- ences in emphasis on the etiological varia- bles of agonistic behavior, there is little doubt now that the causes of animal aggres- sion are not as simple as the Lorenzians would have us believe and that the stimuli evoking aggressive reponses can be ecologi- cal, social, experiential, genetic, hereditary, hormonal, and even psychological (percep- tual). Can animal research shed light on human behavior in general and human aggression in particular? By repeatedly stressing our common origin with animals, the Lorenzians ignore the crucial fact that contemporary monkeys and apes are not the equivalents of human ancestors (Washburn and Hamburg, 1973: 64). Without direct fossil evidence for the evolution of behavior, we cannot make an inductive leap from contemporary pri- mates to our hominid ancestors nor from the latter to contemporary man. Even in physiological attributes, contemporary man is unique. For his brain has 'enlarged from roughly 500 cc 1.75 million years ago to about 1450 cc at present' (Holloway, 1968. 13). Compared also with the ape or monkey, the 'social brain' - the parts in human brain that evolved in response to social pres- sures and that today mediate appropriate so- cial behavior - has undergone a three-fold increase in size (Washburn and Hamburg, 1973: 77). The hazards of extrapolatory leap from animal to human behavior stem from a large inventory of uniquely human characteristics of Homo sapiens: greater survivability stem- ming from his greater adaptability and les- ser dependence on any particular environ- ment; greater communicative and symbolic skills, greater skill in the use of nonbiologi- cal tools and weapons; greater and more generalized intellectual capacities; greater control over emotions; greater prevalence of organized violence; primacy of social and cultural factors in the formation of hierarchy systems; greater diversity and range of in- stigating stimuli for aggression; greater va- riety and dimension of manifestations of ag- gression; and greater cultural, social, and psychological capacities to produce conflict or cooperation without direct physical stim- uli derived from the immediate sensory organs. Evidence for Human Aggression and War How much substantive evidence can we find in the empirical literature of peace research to support the Lorenzian theory of human aggression and war? It is beyond the scope of the present paper to review the entire</page><page sequence="12">264 Samuel S. Kim literature; instead, we focus on a few crucial elements of the Lorenzian theory: instinc- tive-spontaneous-hydraulic process of aggres- sion; indispensability of aggression for the preservation of individuals and species as well as for the mastery of creative human endeavors; pathology of undischarged ag- gression; territorial aggression; and cathar- sis as the prescriptive remedy for human warfare. The Lorenzian theory of spontaneous ag- gression is aptly referred to as an energy model of motivation, but it is developed largely from the observations of some ani- mal behavior - the hunting behavior of the dog, food-begging of a young bird, fighting in a fish, courtship flights of a butterfly (Lehrman, 1953). However, many students of animal behavior argue that there is no neurophysiological evidence for hydraulics in the brain (Alland, 1969; Hailman, 1969; Hinde, 1973; Lehrman, 1953; Schneirla, 1966; Scott, 1958). Experimental evidence is much weaker for spontaneous aggression in man. Most students of human behavior - psychol- ogists, neurophysiologists, anthropologists, and social psychologists - reject the instinc- tive-hydraulic model; instead, they view ag- gression as one among many potential reac- tions to a variety of situations. It is indeed difficult to imagine how man's complex be- havioral patterns can be experimentally de- lineated with a simple mechanical model of physical energy. The influence of learning and training on aggressive behavior, which has gained a con- siderable experimental support (Berkowitz, 1973; Hunt, 1973; Moyer, 1971; Nelson, 1974; Richter, 1950; Scott, 1958; Scott and Frede- ricson, 1951; Tedeschi et al., 1974), also cast doubt on the notion of spontaneous aggres- sion. For Scott and Fredericson (1951: 306), training can overcome hereditary predispo- sitions, and therefore 'training includes by far the most important group of factors which affect agonistic behavior.' In one study (Richter, 1950), a complete inhibition of eating behavior was brought about by negative reinforcement in the form of sub- lethal doses of poison with the result that the subjects (rats) starved to death. That the physiological and emotional variables in- volved in aggressive behavior are different from those involved in sexual and ingestive behavior has been most cogently stated by J. P. Scott, who has done extensive research on aggression. 'Thus we have a mechanism', Scott (1973:138) responds to Lorenz's no- tion of spontaneous aggression, 'which pro- longs and magnifies the effects of external stimulation but no mechanism for building up the first stimulation from within. There is no internal change corresponding to the change in blood sugar which results in hunger'. The Lorenzian argument that aggression has been adaptive in the evolutionary sense or that 'collective militant enthusiasm, which is the prerequisite for war, is also the pre- requisite for all higher human endeavor' is untenable. To validate such an argument, one would have to demonstrate that aggres- sion has specifically contributed to the sur- vival of Homo sapiens. If aggres'sion has a quantifiable survival value, one would also find its distribution universal in place and continuous in time. Instead of producing a testable hypothesis or empirical or historical data, Lorenz merely restates the old Hob- besian cliche of war as the natural state of man. Even though there is no 'fossil behav- ior', there is no accepted evolutionary theory which suggests killers are more adaptive than pacifists. 'The survivors in the evolu- tionary rat-race', observes Leach (1973: 155), 'are of two kinds - those which are disin- clined to kill at all and those which are in- clined to kill but are inhibited against kil- ling members of their own kind'. It is difficult indeed to imagine how homo homini lupus whose life was so 'nasty, brutish, and short' could have survived, mul- tiplied, and even become the dominant spe- cies, while '99.9999 percent of all the species that have ever arisen are now extinct' (Cor- ning, 1971: 355). The argument that many of man's charitable acts pass away uncom- piled (Hunt, 1973) and that the highest</page><page sequence="13">The Lorenzian Theory 265 premium has been placed on cooperation throughout the five million or so years of man's evolution (Montagu, 1973) still re- mains to be effectively rebutted. The oft- cited figure of fifty-nine million deaths from murders to world wars during the 126 years (from 1820 to 1945) in Richardson's (1960b: 153) classic study cannot be used uncritically to support the Lorenzian thesis. Fifty-nine million deaths amount to about 1.6 percent of all deaths during the period;16 moreover, 46.8 million (93.60/o) of the total come from the upper four ranges in the eight-range scale of magnitude, showing a greater de- structiveness of collective violence than in- dividual aggression. Besides, nation-states have varied so much in the frequency of their participation in wars during the period that Richardson (1960b: x, 176) argues that 'none can be properly characterized as inherently bel- ligerent or inherently pacific' [italics added]. Small and Singer (1970: 152) also find that more than half the nations (77 out of 144) which were at one time or another members of the international system in the period 1816-1965 were able to escape international war entirely. A multivariate analysis of 652 primitive societies (taken from A Study of War by Quincy Wright) by Broch and Gal- tung (1966) shows that only 33?/o were 'bel- ligerent' in the sense that they were reputed to engage in aggressive warfare for econom- ic and political exploitation. Even more tel- lingly, the level of belligerency increased with decreasing primitivity (i.e., increasing civilization).17 Whatever functions the wars of the dis- tant past may have served, certainly modern war - even apart from its moral question - provides a poor survival or cathartic value. The soldiers in modern times are being con- stantly indoctrinated through positive and negative reinforcement to subordinate their individual impulses to the dictates of the state. Available studies of soldiers in com- bat (Allport, 1950; Moskos, 1969; Stouffer, 1949; Shils and Janowitz, 1948) have shown that the aggressive urge to fight the enemy was less commonly felt than individual self- interest - fear, concern for safety and sur- vival, homesickness, anxiety for family wel- fare back home, job dissatisfaction, and boredom. The My Lai Massacre is a pathog- ical abnormality in the context of modern warfare. Levi (1966: 151) finds that 'in some armies more than half the men who were supposed to shoot did not pull the trigger.' The refusal of Company A (of the 19th Light Infantry Brigade, Third Battalion of the US Army in Vietnam) to obey the order to move out is also revealing (Moskos, 1969). A large-scale social science investigation conducted by the War Department's In- formation and Education Division during World War II revealed that many soldiers were engaged in 'goldbricking' - that is, appearing to be busy without really accom- plishing anything (Stouffer, 1949). The Ger- man soldier during World War II gratified his primary needs through the primary group. As the war situation worsened for Germany with the corresponding disintegra- tion of the primary group in the Wehrmacht, he progressively regressed into a narcissistic state in which moral and political symbols of the outer world were irrelevant to his first concern - 'saving his own skin' (Shils and Janowitz, 1948). For the American soldier in Vietnam, the decisions of his government that brought him into combat were irrelevant and mean- ingless, and the paramount factor affecting his combat motivation was the operation of the rotation system (Moskos, 1969). A typical American soldier in Vietnam may have spent no more than a few hours in actual fighting during his two-year term in the Army, the greatest part of his service time being devoted to allelomimetic behavior, 'behavior in which two or more individuals do the same thing at the same time, with some degree of mutual stimulation' (Scott, 1969: 130). Moreover, the ratio between front-line soldiers and rear-area supporters is rapidly changing in favor of the latter. In push-button and computerized wars, there is no survival or cathartic value.</page><page sequence="14">266 Samuel S. Kim Contrary to the Lorenzian assertion, there is no evidence in the studies of achievement motivation that aggression is indispensable for intellectual pursuit. In the best-known study of achievement motivation, McClel- land and his associates (1953) concluded that there was no correlation between the instiga- tion to aggression and achievement motiva- tion. It has also been reported (New York Times, 1971) that violent living conditions in the black ghettos of American cities impede a child's intellectual development. Based on their experimental study of ghetto school children in Washington, D.C., psy- chologists Gene Gordon and Dale Meers conclude that 'the constant atmosphere of violence of the ghetto, absorbed into the un- conscious in the form of fantasies, had ar- rested ego development', which is believed to be essential to reality perception or learn- ing (cited in New York Times, 1971). Indeed there is much to be said for the hypothesis that aggression, far from being normal, healthy or indispensable, is a path- ological symptom. Mark and Ervin (1970) argue persuasively that the notion of spon- taneous and self-generating aggression holds true only for people with specific brain ab- normalities, some of which may be genetical- ly inherited. Moyer (1971) also states that several types of brain dysfunction as well as low blood sugar are associated with patho- logical hyperirritability and aggressive be- havior in humans. Frank (1968: 46) mentions one type of brain fever - encephalitis lethargica - as being responsible for 'a per- sonality change characterized by marked destructiveness and impulsiveness'. Fromm (1973: 6) explains Hitler's 'malignant ag- gression' in terms of necrophilia - 'the pas- sion to destroy life and the attraction to all that is dead, decaying, and purely mechani- cal'. Although evidence is still too tentative, several XYY chromosome studies in prisons 'do demonstrate a variety of endocrinologi- cal, neurological, and other abnormalities which appear related to their [criminals'] deviant behavior' (Shah, 1973: 53). Likewise, Lauretta Bender (1973), a child psychologist who worked for more than three decades with disturbed children in New York City and State, observes that hostile aggression in a child is not a normal pattern of behavior, which infrequently occurs as a result of endogenous pathology in the context of dis- turbing social and environmental situations. The experimental data and analyses pre- sented above do not provide firm support for the Lorenzian thesis that undischarged aggression would have serious pathological effects. However, Lorenz relies on an un- published lecture by Sydney Margolin to 'prove' that the Ute Indians suffer more fre- quently from neurosis and accident-prone- ness than any other human group because of their undischarged aggression (1966:244- 245). Omer C. Stewart (1973), who has stu- died the Ute Indians since 1930 and published most extensively on their ethnology, their history, and their adjustment to modern life, has shown how utterly erroneous Lorenz's account is of the Prairie Indians in general and of the Utes in particular. Pointing out numerous factual errors in Lorenz's account, Stewart (1973: 224) concludes: 'Like most other American Indians, the Ute have been victims of alcohol and under its influence have committed many criminal acts and have been careless with their own lives and the lives of others. But this has been true of the tribes of the Atlantic Coast states, the Chip- pewa of the Great Lakes, the Northwest Coast fishing Indians, etc'. Stewart has also managed to have his statement of rebuttal approved by three other experts on the Ute: Elbert J. Floyd, John R. White, and Arthur L. Warner. Although territorial behavior is not as simple or as unitary or universal a phe- nomenon as Lorenz and Ardrey make it to be, there is nonetheless strong evidence sup- porting the Lorenzian thesis in several stu- dies of such nonhuman species as fish, birds, mice, insects, and some mammals (Calhoun, 1961, 1962; Hogland, 1973' Tinbergen, 1956). It has been observed experimentally in the behaviors of these animals that overcrowd-</page><page sequence="15">The Lorenzian Theory 267 ing causes a pathological breakdown in their normal social interactions including court- ship, mating, and maternal behavior. How- ever, man's nearest relatives among pri- mates - the savannah monkeys, the chim- panzee and gorilla - do not show as much territorial behavior (Crook, 1973; Scott, 1973). In addition, caribou, elephants, sea otters, whale, and lemmings apparently have no territories, while such animals as gophers, prairie dogs, and marmots in the temperate zone have communal dwellings (Carrighar, 1970). Is there evidence for supporting 'instinc- tive territorial aggression' in man? Actually, Lorenz and Ardrey do not make a clear con- ceptual distinction between individual terri- torialism and group territorialism. But the difference seems critical because of the in- herent 'biological' incompatibility between the two. In times of war, most men would have to give up their individual territorial- ism in defense of group territorialism, even though the two may be symbolically wedded through patriotic propaganda. Most empirical studies have shown dis- cernible correlations between geographical contiguity (common frontiers) and frequency of war involvement (Richardson, 1960b; Sin- ger, 1972; Wright, 1965). In Richardson's (1960b: 297) study, for example, 'the number of a state's external wars has a positive cor- relation of 0.77 with the number of its fron- tiers'. However, common frontiers mean fre- quent contacts and interactions. Unless con- tact as a variable is clearly isolated from contiguity, we should not read too much into the positive correlation.18 Besides, to say that most states would defend their terri- tory when attacked is to avoid the more cri- tical question - Why do some states attack, making it necessary for the attacked to de- fend their territory? It is not possible for all the states to attack and defend at the same time. In order to probe into this causal ques- tion, we have to examine Lorenz's repeated assertion that crowding or population densi- ty causes hostility and aggression. Although available evidence is still meagre and fragmentary, it does seem to lean against the Lorenzian proposition that crowding necessarily causes hostility and aggression. Man's territorial or 'proxemic' behavior under crowded conditions seems to vary widely depending on a multitude of causal variables - ecological, social, cultur- al, sexual, circumstantial, psychological (ex- pectational), and political. Since the high incidence of violent crime, street gangwars, juvenile delinquency, men- tal illness, and rioting as extreme expres- sions of interpersonal and intergroup ag- gression is found predominantly in over- crowded American cities, it would be tempt- ing to make a prima facie correlation be- tween population density or crowding and aggressive behavior. However, recent experi- mental studies (Ehrlich and Freedman, 1973; Freedman et al., 1972) have produced some unexpected results. Crowding per se, with income level, malnutrition, noise, filth and other related variables controlled, has no ap- preciable overall effect on crime, mental illness, competitiveness, and aggressiveness. Nonetheless, experiments showed that males became somewhat more competitive, vindic- tive, and aggressive while females became more lenient, tolerant, and cooperative un- der crowded conditions. In addition, the presence of females ex- erted some ameliorating influence upon male aggressiveness. 'Territoriality (personal space), Freedman et al. (1972: 545) con- clude, 'seems to be largely a characteristic of the males of a species rather than the females'. Ehrlich and Freedman (1973: 282) also conclude their study by offering an in- teresting piece of advice for peace research: All-male juries or cabinets or international con- ferences should probably be avoided, or at least be given spacious quarters. Better still, women should be included, not only to give them equal representation, but because apparently any neg- ative effects of crowding disappear when the sexes are mixed. There is thus strong argument to eliminate the secretive meetings of men in back rooms deciding our fates - and bring them out into the open where their decisions are less likely to be aggressive.</page><page sequence="16">268 Samuel S. Kim Furthermore, available studies of war es- tablish no correlation between population density and war-proneness. Instead of the expected correlation between the degree of foreign conflict and population density, Haas (1965: 315) finds 'a slight inverse rela- tion' in his study of societal variables con- tributing to foreign conflict behavior of na- tion-states. Finding no relationship between the rapid increase of world population from 1820 and 1949 and any proportionate in- crease in the frequency of, and losses from, war, Richardson (1960b: 167) concluded: 'There is a suggestion, but not a conclusive proof, that mankind has become less warlike since A.D. 1820'.'1 Singer (1972: 267) too finds 'no significant association between a nation's growth rate in population or density and its war-prone- ness' in his study of ninety-three interna- tional wars during the period 1816-1965. Po- pulation pressures may or may not lead to international conflict, Wright (1965: 1130) concluded his study, 'depending upon a multitude of geographic, cultural, techno- logical, physiological, political, military, psy- chological, and other factors in the parti- cular situation'. Lastly, the Lorenzian catharsis prescrip- tion finds little support in the experimental literature. In fact, ample evidence points to the opposite direction - that is, the expres- sion of aggression tends to strengthen subse- quent aggressive response (Berkowitz, 1962, 1968a, 1973; Eysenck, 1955, 1966; Goldstein and Arms, 1971; Moyer, 1973b' Singer, 1971). Experiments with children have dem- onstrated that live and film models are equally effective in instigating aggression (Bandura et al., 1961, 1963' Lovibond, 1967). The reinforcement influence works in such a way as to generalize from one kind of be- havior to another through the common de- nominator - the attempt to injure some ob- ject or person. A laboratory experiment has shown, for example, that children exposed to aggressive adult models reproduced and generalized aggressive behavior to a new setting while children in the nonaggressive control groups exhibited virtually no imita- tive aggression (Bandura et al., 1961).20 The reinforcement potency of the model- ing process in facilitating aggressive behav- ior was further confirmed in another experi- ment, in which children were exposed to film-mediated aggressive models. Moreover, this experiment produced significant sexual variables: boys, compared to girls, exhibited significantly more total aggression(t = 2.69, p &lt;.01), more imitative aggression (t = 2.82, p &lt;.005), more aggressive gun play (z = 3.38, p &lt;.001), and more nonimitative aggressive behavior (t = 2.98, p &lt;.005), while girls were more inclined to sit on the Bobo doll but refrained from punching it (z = 3.47, p &lt;.001) (Bandura et al., 1963: 8). Similarly, experiments with adult audi- ences hardly support the contention of Eibl- Eibesfeldt (and of the TV and movie indus- try) that fantasy aggression works as a so- cially safe and vicarious outlet for the sup- posedly pent-up aggressive energy within the audience (Berkowitz and Rawlings, 1963; Berkowitz et al., 1963). Instead of providing an easy and safe cathartic outlet, watching filmed violence increases the probability that someone in the audience will behave aggressively in a later situation. The more recent works prepared for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence (1969) and for the Surgeon General (1972) on the impact of televised violence also present strong evidence, sug- gesting a causal relationship between wit- nessed violence and an observer's subsequent aggressive behavior. Experimental data are equally damaging to Lorenz's proposal of aggressive sporting contests as a cathartic outlet. Eysenck (1966), drawing on his own earlier experiments as well as on those of others, states that there is a consistent tendency for persons aggres- sive in one context to be aggressive in an- other context. He concludes that there are positive correlations - as high as +0.4 for various groups - between instances and ex- pressions of aggression. Goldstein and Arms (1971) conducted field interviews at the</page><page sequence="17">The Lorenzian Theory 269 196i9 Army-Navy football game and also at an Army-Temple gymnastics meet (during the sanme month) in order to compare the hostility of spectators before and after the games, using the Buss-Durkee inventory with the possible range of hostility scores from 0 to 28. Results: regardless of the subjects' preferred team, post-football game hostility was greater than pre-game (F = 5.29, df = 1/144, p &lt;.025), showing little effect for pre- ferred team (F &lt;1.0) or for the interaction effect (F &lt;1.0), while the pre-meet hostility mnean of gymnastics spectators (12.00) was not significantly different from the post- meet hostility mean (12.71, t =.66, df = 79, p &lt;.20), showing that hostility did not rise significantly as a result of observing a phy- sically nonaggressive sport event. They ar- rive at the logical conclusion: regardless of teanm preference and the outcome of the game, watching an aggressive sport leads to an increase in hostility among spectators. Several soccer riots and one soccer war in Latin America, the wanton destruction of train interiors by British football team sup- porters, and the behavior of players and spectators at professional hockey games in North America, to mention a few examples, are hardly reassuring to the Lorenzian as- sumption that sporting contests provide a healthy and cooperative outlet for the 'col- lective militant enthusiasm' of nation-states. Lorenz's fallacy lies in his extrapolative equation of physical energy with psychologi- cal energy. If a drop in systolic blood pres- sure is a sign of physiological relaxation, a simple performance of physical activity or free aggression against any object or person does not work. This is because 'the frustrated person (who wants, and is prepared, to at- tack his frustrater) may be primarily con- cerned with injuring the person who had provoked him' (Berkowitz, 1968a: 171). Even Tinbergen refuses to agree with Lorenz that redirected attack exhausts the aggressive urge. Aggressive behavior, Tinbergen (1968: 1418) argues, has two simultaneous but op- posite effects - a waning effect and a self- inflammatory effect - but the self-inflam- matory effect often wins. The basic flaw in Lorenz's catharsis thesis stems from his hydraulic conceptualization of human aggression. As the experimental evidence examined in this paper suggests, aggressive behavior is largely a learned habit which can be easily activated by cultural cues. Instead of deflating physical energy, aggressive competition tends to arouse stress and anxiety and to enhance the strength of an individual's aggressive poten- tial unless checked by stronger inhibitions. The free and permissive expression of ag- gression weakens inhibitions, strengthens ag- gressive tendencies, provides more cues, and blunts perceptual and judgmental norms of the observer and the actor alike. In the final analysis, the Lorenzian theory cannot account adequately for human ag- gression because it is insensitive to the re- lative importance of different causal vari- ables, such as sex, age, social class and or- ganization, culture, ecological habitat, frus- tration (deprivation) level, experiential fac- tor, and inherited and/or learned predisposi- tion of individuals. Indeed the popularity of the Lorenzian theory may lie in its diagram- matic simplicity and sweeping application. But the theory that assumes so much uni- formity of human behavior in time and place cannot explain human aggressive behavior in sociopolitical contexts, let alone predict when wars will be fought or avoided, or who will win or lose, and why. Policy Implications Whether the present critique of Lorenzian- ism is valid or not may not matter much beyond the narrow confines of academic specialists, were it not for the fact that Lo- renz has mounted a pulpit to preach to man- kind and that his message now attracts such a wide and uncritical acceptance among so large an audience. Capturing the malaise of our violence-afflicted times, the Lorenzians - especially Ardrey - have transformed Original Sin, Hobbesianism, and Darwinism</page><page sequence="18">270 Samuel S. Kim into a political movement. In short, Lorenz- ianism as it is now propagated, believed, or practiced poses some serious policy and be- havioral implications for peace research. Ominously, Lorenzianism has appeared at a time when the rising tide of violence in human affairs seems to defy any logical or rational explanation. Is it not possible that Lorenz's thesis of man's innate depravity could easily be misused by those who ra- tionalize the use of force as a healthy, nec- essary or inevitable historical process? 'War is', declared General Friedrich von Bernhardi in 1912, 'a biological necessity... it is as necessary as the struggle of the elements in nature - it gives a biologically just decision since its decision rest [sic] on the very na- ture of things' (quoted in Clare, 1969: 163). Since Lorenz asserts with authority and con- viction that aggression is integral to ambi- tion, love, friendship, intellectual vigor, and other socially sanctioned attributes, a con- temporary von Bernhardi could easily dis- guise himself as a Lorenzian in propagating militarism. There is a clear and continuing danger that Lorenzianism without Lorenz could pro- vide a 'scientific' foundation upon which a new conservative-racial-militaristic ideology can be constructed.2i Lorenz's biological de- terminism, his eufunctional view of aggres- sion, his dualism on collective militant en- thusiasm, his love of tradition,22 his zeal for aggressive competition, his authoritarian at- titude,23 and his disregard of institution- alized aggression coupled with his unre- strained penchant for politicizing his theory of aggression - all of these would place Lorenz in the company of those who cham- pion the political status quo at best and mil- itarism at worst. However, the politicization of Lorenzianism reaches its peak in the writings of Ardrey (1966: 316-317), a skill- ful popularizer of Lorenzianism who pre- sents gloriifed views of white South Africa as 'attaining peaks of affluence, order, se- curity, and internal solidarity rivaled by few long-established nations' and of American military intervention in Indochina. Man's behavior, including his war-making or his war-avoiding, is powerfully influ- enced by his belief and expectation. The belief in the inevitability of war or the ex- pectation of omnipresent aggression may it- self become a cause of war through a self- fulfilling prophecy. The notion that most people deplore war but expect it to continue and that the factor of expectancy becomes the indispensable condition for war (Allport, 1950) has gained some additional support in recent years (Putney and Middleton, 1962; Granberg, 1969). Even in a cross-cul- tural survey of the warfare patterns of primitive peoples all over the world, 'the strongest relationship that shows up is the positive correlation between war frequency and military expectations' (Naroll, 1970:35 italics in the original). The Lorenzian view that human aggression is instinctive, spontaneous, and unmodifi- able24 both enhances the old Hobbesian theme that war is natural and inevitable and encourages the fatalistic sense of low effi- cacy -the 'nothing much we can do about it' attitude. We can hardly expect to make war obsolete if we refuse to believe it is a human invention or that it can be indeed abolished. Lorenzianism stands as a formi- dable conceptual barrier in the way of changing our attitudinal and behavioral orientation toward the nature of war. Conclusion The central point of the present article is that research on the causes and correlates of war cannot benefit from Lorenzianism in its present state of knowledge and conceptuali- zation. As this paper has attempted to show, the Lorenzian theory of aggression and war is seriously flawed on conceptual, methodo- logical, and substantive grounds. The cava- lier use of operationally ill-defined terms and concepts, the almost exclusive reliance on casual anecdotes, the disregard of em- pirical studies contradicting the monocausal paradigm, the inductive/extrapolative leaps to solve the level-of-analysis problem, 'the</page><page sequence="19">the Lorenzian Theory 271 cross-species generalizations based on the uncritical merging of human and animal be- havior, and the recurrent tendency to ad- vance argument in finalistic termns with little supporting evidence - all these weaknesses warrant scientific disapproval of the Lo- renzian theory. Moreover, the Lorenzian approach raises some disturbing moral implications bearing on our social behavior as well as on our public policy. Because of its monocausal and monoexplanatory view of human aggression and war, its implicit association with war- prone attributes (militarism, conservatism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and racial- ism), and its inadequacy in the methodology and theoretical analysis of conflict resolu- tion, the Lorenzian theory is not a useful model for the development of an applied science of war prevention. A naive and un- critical enthusiasm in embracing Lorenzian- ism can be a misleading and even dangerous pursuit. It is therefore clearly in the inter- est of peace that we should be vigilant, wary of the current voguish movement of Loren- zian ethology. However, this is not to belittle contri- butions an ethological/biological approach could make to peace research. While etho- logical/biological theories do not adjust themselves easily to the revolutionary changes in the nature of war that have taken place in modern times, especially since Hiroshima, they nonetheless present a neces- sary challenge for our self-scrutiny as well as against the holistic paradigm of environ- mental determinism. By successfully delineat- ing ways in which behavioral patterns can be shaped by constant and dynamic bio-en- vironmental interactions and manners in wvhich sign-stimuli of the environment work in eliciting certain sequences of motor ac- tion in animals under appropriate internal physiological conditions, the developmental school in ethology has shown legitimate ways of assimilating the work of the biologi- cal sciences into models, hypotheses, and ex- planations about human behavior in a speci- fically delimited situation. Specifically, this kind of ethological research can open up possibilities of exploring the types and ef- fects of the biological inputs in a crisis deci- sion-making process.25 Perhaps the widespread vogue of Lo- renzianism should be greeted as an intellec- tual opportunity rather than feared as a threat to peace research. The current state of peace research, characterized as it is by completely divergent paths of politically naive ethologists and biologically naive be- havioral scientists, is unhealthy. Before we can make a prudent, selective synthesis of whatever ethology has to offer, however, more and more social scientists engaged in peace research need to do ethological/bio- logical research. This might open up a needed dialogue with those ethologists who have something more useful than Lorenzian- ism to offer. Failing that, we will have only ourselves to blame when the day comes, if it has not already, when Lorenzianism is propagated as the 'gospel' of peace research. NOTES 1. The clearest - and the last - position Freud took on human aggression was stated in 1930, when he said: 'In all that follows I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to ag- gression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man, and I return to my view that it constitutes the greatest impediment to civiliza- tion' (Freud, 1962: 69). 2. Most peace researchers would agree that Quincy Wright and Lewis Richardson have in- deed made pioneering contributions to the devel- opment of peace research as a science. Singer and Small (1972: 4) expressed a judgement in their important book on war that 'the important turn- ing point is marked by the rise of scientific (and therefore quantitative) analyses of war, mani- fested primarily in the work of Quincy Wright and Lewis Richardson beginning in the 1930s.' However, the inclusion of Freud and Lorenz in this category by Alcock is mystifying. Perhaps, Alcock's conception of war, which appears to be a variant on the Lorenzian theme, may explain the mystery. 'War is,' Alcock (1972: 199) states, 'an overt action resulting from man's innate aggres- siveness' [italics in the original].</page><page sequence="20">272 Samuel S. Kim 3. This paper is premised on the acceptance of Galtung's conceptualization of peace research as 'an effort to promote the realization of values (Galtung, 1969: 190); furthermore, the values peace research seeks to promote refer not only to negative peace ('absence of violence') but also to positive peace ('social justice'). 4.'The form of an instinctive behaviour pat- tern,' to quote Lorenz's own words, 'exhibits re- markable independence from all receptor process - not just independence from 'experience' in the broadest sense of the term but also from stimuli which impinge upon the organism during per- formance of the pattern' (Lorenz, 1970; italics in the original; see also Lorenz, 1970: 250, 314, 322, 348). 5. Lorenz's view on Freud's concept of aggres- sion was stated in the following terms: 'Freud - I'm simplifying a great deal - discovered the eternal instinctive drives, those not dependent on environment, in a time when the doctrine of the conditioned reflex was at its acme. If he had only that he would have deserved three Nobel prizes, but he generalized the properties of sexuality onto all the other instincts. Perhaps his fundamental error was to have made aggression the antago- nist of life. He made it something of a devil' (de Towarnicki, 1970: 29). 6. 'Militant enthusiasm,' Lorenz (1966: 268) de- fines, 'is a specialized form of communal aggres- sion, clearly distinct from and yet functionally re- lated to the more primitive forms of petty indi- vidual aggression.' 7. Lorenz himself seems to be admitting this point, when he wrote: 'Many modern ethologists, particularly those publishing in English, contend that the term innate is not only useless, but heuristically harmful. They assume that phylo- genetic adaptation and adaptive modification can be added to and mixed with each other in any behaviour mechanism, however minute and ele- mentary. For this reason, they regard it as hope- less and even dangerous to try separating, in ex- periment or thought, innate and learned elements of behavior' (Lorenz, 1965: 102). 8. Lorenz repeatedly attempts to justify his ap- proach as 'inductive natural science.' His ap- proach 'also provides convincing proof of the in- dispensable necessity for the broadest possible knowledge of concrete individual facts, collected through unprejudiced observation and termed the 'inductive basis' of a natural science' (Lorenz, 1971: 131; italics in the original). In a similar vein, he deplores 'overestimation of the primacy of the entity over its components and underesti- mation of the relatively entity-independent com- ponent' (Lorenz, 1971: 125). 9. Carrighar (1970:42) contends that Lorenz's research with tamed animals such as geese in- duced by guard fences and captive cichlid fishes in tanks has enormously heightened their aggres- siveness. 10.'The more distantly the animal is related to man,' observe Washburn and Hamburg (1973: 66), 'the less the human perception of the situation is likely to correspond to that of the animal.' 11.Ardrey's methodology is so crude and his analogic speculation so wild that The Territorial Imperative should be relegated to the category of pseudo-science fiction. To make a methodological critique of his work would seem superfluous. Even Lorenz (1970; xiv; Evans, 1974: 86) admits that Ardrey sometimes makes him 'suffer' and 'perspire.' 12. To the question, 'Does the study of the be- havior of animal throw light on the behavior of man?' Lorenz responded: 'If you know animals well, you know yourself reasonably well' (de Towarnicki, 1970: 4). 13. After comparing the Lorenzian theory of aggression with Freud's, Fromm (1973: 20-21) also observed: 'Lorenz, at least when writing On Aggression, seems not to have had any firsthand knowledge of Freud's work. There is not a single direct reference to his writings, and what refer- ences there are refer to what psychoanalytic friends told him about Freud's position; regretta- bly they are not always right, or they have not been accurately understood.' 14. Lorenz reasserts his conviction in a 1970 in- terview: 'Believe me, one day everything I've said will seem very ordinary' (de Towarnicki, 1970: 30; italics added). 15. For substantiation of this point based on extensive field research by primatologists, see the following: Goodall, 1965; Nishida, 1970; Reynolds and Reynolds, 1965; and Schaller, 1965. 16. Singer and Small (1972: 374), whose quanti- tative study of war identified 93 international wars in the period 1816-1965, count 'the death of over 29 million military personnel, exclusive of civilians.' 17. Singer and Small (1972) dispute the preva- lent belief in the increase of the frequency of war. 'Whether we look at the number of wars', they (1972: 201) observe, 'their severity or their mag- nitude, there is no significant trend upward or down over the past 150 years'. However, they note that 'most of the war in the [international] system has been accounted for by a small fraction of the nations, most of which would be found near</page><page sequence="21">The Lorenzian Theory 273 the top of any hierarchy based on diplomatic status, military-industrial capability, or related in- dicators' (Singer and Small, 1972: 287). 18. Europe clearly emerges as the most war- prone region of the world, according to Singer and Small's study. However, the authors caution that this may be a consequence of their selection criteria (Singer and Small, 1972: 296). It should also be added here that European nations sharing common frontiers had extensive interactions with each other. 19. While finding a strong tendency toward periodicity in the international system's war ex- periences, Singer and Small (1972), as noted above, find no trend upward or downward in the frequency of international war during much the same period covered by Richardson. 20. Eysenck (1966) also shows numerous ex- perimental studies which demonstrated with equal force the reinforcement power of the modeling process in facilitating anti-militaristic and anti- war attitude and behavior. 21. Willhoite (1971: 629-630), who has examined the Lorenzian thought from the historical per- spective of Western political philosophy, con- cludes that 'Lorenz seems to have much in com- mon with the conservative tradition in Western political thought.' 22. For a well-highlighted position of Lorenz on tradition, see his interview with de Towar- nicki (1970). 23. 'I would venture to say', Lorenz expressed his somewhat authoritarian attitude in his inter- view with de Towarnicki (1970: 27), 'that in man there is a direct correlation between the hate among children and the lack of a dominant father.' 24. Lorenz's view on this matter was stated as follows: 'It is the spontaneity of the instinct that makes it so dangerous. If it were merely a reac- tion to certain external factors, as many sociolo- gists and psychologists maintain, the state of mankind would not be as perilous as it really is, for, in that case, the reaction-eliciting factors could be eliminated with some hopes of success' (Lorenz, 1966: 50; italics added). 25. That this can be done fruitfully has been shown by Ole Holsti in his book, Crisis, Escala- tion, War (1972), which explores the types and consequences of crisis-induced stress upon those aspects of individual and organizational perform- ance that most directly bear upon the outcomes of foreign policy making.

SUMMARY Partly as a challenge to biologically naive social scientists and partly as a response to the current vogue of Lorenzian ethology, several political scientists have already issued pleas on behalf of biologically oriented research in political science. This paper argues that an uncritical application of Lorenzian ethology to the social sciences in general and to peace research in particular is mis- leading and may even be dangerous. The paper may be summarized as follows. First, the wrirtings of Lorenz and some of his followers are examined with special reference to aggression and war. Second, the Lorenzian theory of aggres- sion is critically evaluated on conceptual, meth- odological, and substantive grounds against a background of theoretical, empirical, and ex- perimental studies in animal and human aggres- sion. Third, the Lorenzian theory of aggression is examined in terms of its relevance and usefulness for peace research and its implications for public policy. Lastly, the paper concludes with the following contention: given the present conceptual and empirical status of the Lorenzian theory of ag- gression, there is no reason to believe that peace research can profit from its application. The cavalier use of operationally ill-defined terms and concepts, the almost exclusive reliance on casual anecdotes, the disregard of empirical studies con- tradicting the monocausal paradigm, the induc- tive/extrapolative leaps to solve the level-of-ana- lysis problem, the cross-species generalizations based on the uncritical merging of human and animal behavior, and the recurring tendency to advance argument in finalistic terms with little supporting evidence - all these weaknesses are spelled out in the paper. However, this conclusion does not deny that an ethological/biological ap- proach to the problems of the social sciences could make a positive contribution to peace re- search.</page></plain_text>
