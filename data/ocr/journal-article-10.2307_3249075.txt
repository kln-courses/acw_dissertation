<plain_text><page sequence="1">H. GOETZ A KASHMIRI LINGAM OF THE IOTH CENTURY This small lingam which I intend to publish here, had been shown to me by an American amateur collector. It is of considerable interest not only because it belongs to a little ex- plored phase of Kashmirl art, but also because of its exceptional type. The sculpture, apparently of some sort of chlorite, represents merely the proper right half of an Ekamukha-lingam (fig. I) which once had been joined to another half by means of a hinge the grooves for which still are visible on the back (fig. 2); the sectional plane is filled with a sunk relief of Siva and Parvati (fig. 3). The measurements are: height 7.65 cm, breadth along the foot of the relief 5.6 cm, at its maximum (height of the nose of mukhalingam) 6.6 cm, breadth be- tween the section and the proper right of the lingam 3.4 cm. The workmanship of the exterior is very fine, that of the interior relief not so good, though this may, to some degree, be due both to technical difficulties and to later damages. The pocket size of the lingam makes it probable that it was intended for the personal use of a nobleman or high official who had to do a good deal of travelling. That small idols were carried in the luggage, is often mentioned in the Rajput traditions and must have been an old custom. When in ritual use, such idols were placed on a collapsible bronze or silver stand with an umbrel- la, such as are not rarely depicted in Rajasthani and Pahari miniatures. This may again have sug- gested the idea of a sort of chapel, because such chapel-like boxes were likewise used in travel- ling, are in fact still the custom in Nepal and Tibet, and are likewise common as house shrines in Rajput castles of the Himalaya. But on the other hand, the lingam as the exterior disguise of an anthropomorphic aspect of Siva is quite familiar, e. g. in the fiery lingam from which the god emerges in order to reveal himself to Brahma and Visnu, or in the Kalari-murti where he does the same in order to protect Markandeya against the god of death. Also later Buddhism had similar ideas about the stupa (then not so dissimilar from a big lingam) from the interior of which likewise deities could emerge. Though our iconographic knowledge of mediaeval Kash- mirl Saivism still is very scanty, we have all reasons to surmise similar concepts there. Siva's face has a receding forehead and a long nose with a rather high bridge between the brows, countered by protruding sensuous lips, slightly oblique eyes, rather fat cheeks, and a fat neck forming several horizontal folds. This forehead and nose seem to be characteristics of the ancient population of Kashmir, the Khasas. They are found on the tile reliefs of Harvan and the stucco heads from Ushkur (Srinagar Museum), later on the portrait of king Avantivarman in the Avantisvara Temple at Vantipor, the head of Buddha-avatara (fig. 4) on king Samrkara- varman's screen from Divsar (Srinagar Museum) and the Avalokitesvara (fig. 5) and Maya 275</page><page sequence="2">(Birth of the Buddha) belonging to the reign of queen Didda (Srinagar MuseumI). On the other hand, they are rare on the sculptures of the reign of Lalitaditya-Muktapida at Martand, Paraspor, Gupkar, Pandrenthan, etc. where we find more commonly heads with very broad jaws and a nose clearly set off from the forehead. This other type may probably go back to the Western Turks and other inhabitants of ancient Gandhara serving in Lalitaditya's army. Most modern inhab- itants of the Kashmir Valley, on the other hand, are of distinctly Persian type. The fat cheeks and neck (with several folds) recur on the two already mentioned pieces of the reign of queen Didda (A.D. 95 0-1003). This is likewise the case with the rather short and weak legs of the god. Our lingam thus may be attributed to the same period, and thus forms an important piece of art historical evidence for a phase of Kashmirl art of which we know very little. A similar hair style and a similar necklance can be seen on the idol of Siva from Gupkar (the ancient Jyether) in the Srinagar Museum (fig. 6), though in the latter the hair, interrupted by a diadem, is treated in a more naturalistic way; on the lingam it is arranged in strictly stylized rows of short waves as in late Gandharan sculpture. The Gupkar idol has also the three faces of the Siva-Parvati group of the interior relief. It corresponds to the Sadasiva type so common especially in the Deccan and the South (inhe Elephanta "Trimurti"). But basically the figure of the relief is a descendant of the old Siva figures turning up on the Kushana coins since Vema-Kadphises and later the rule since the rule since the Kidaras. Like those latter, Siva, with three faces and four arms, stands in front of his bull (i. e. Vrshantha, Lord of the Bull, Lord of the Bull, whence his Kushana name Oesho). It was thus the most common iconographic type of Siva in Kashmir, and one may raise the question whether the prevalence of a three-faced type of Visnu in Kashmir, what- ever its theological justification may have been, was not an imitation of this Siva type. Parvati wears a costume no longer the fashion in Kashmir since the eighth century at least. How far her upper body is dressed or not, unfortunately is not quite clear. But she wears a piece of cloth loosely falling down from the waist, one end of which, closely folded together, is drawn over her left shoulder. This is a very characteristic fashion turning up already on an early Gand- haran drinking scene in the Lahore Museum2 where the women are almost nude. But this is still the case on a small " Siva and Parvati" relief (fig. 7) from the North-Western Frontier Province, now in the British Museum and attributed by Barrett to the seventh-eighth century (I would prefer to date it not earlier than the ninth). Combined with a "Greek" costume covering the whole body the fashion appears on the "Hariti" statuette from Brar in the Liddar Valley3 and the "Lakshmi" fromVijabror (Srinagar Museum). We may thus surmise that up to the seventh century (i. e. during the period of predominating Gandharan influence) at least, the costume was used, with slight variations, in Kashmir. The last examples, though without the piece of cloth drawn over the shoulder, seem to be some of the colossal statues of Hindu deities from Gupkar and Pandrenthan whose style belongs to the reign of Lalitaditya.

But we should keep in mind that we have to do with a private idol, the idol, the icono- graphic type of which in all probability was copied from famous images in some well-known temple founded many centuries before. For the period in question we may have to think, in the first place, of Vijabror (Vijayesvara), the famous temple founded in the sixth century by the Hephth- alite king Mihirakula4 and destroyed by fire about A.D. I063 in the civil war between the old king Ananta and his son Kalasa. As the Rajatarangini tells us quite clearly that at Vijabror Mi- hirakula, a rather sinister devotee of Siva, settled Brahmans from Gandhara, it seems probable that the sculptures of Hindu deities in a decadent Gandharan style discovered there may go back to his time and that they were still venerated up to the eleventh century, perhaps even later. That some of the statues of goddesses just discussed have been classified as the Buddhist Hariti, or the Hindu Lakshmi or Parvati, seems rather irrelevant. From the earlier chapters of the Radatarangi'Z, however unreliable they may appear from the point of view of political history, it is clear that the hold of Buddhism was limited to a small upper class, and that the people still venerated its indigenous deities. Pancika and Hariti, or Siva and Parvati probably were the same local deities, merely adapted to different cults introduced from the Indian plains. When Bud- dhism disappeared, it was easy to alter the official label. Such changes in the course of time have often occurred in India, as wherever there had been an old, generally prehistoric cult centre, Buddhists, Jains, Saivas and Vaishnavas have entered upon a competition to annex it; with the result that also parallel iconographic types were created. The so-called Hariti of Sahri-Bahlol5 is an example from the North-Western Frontier Province of such a transition. She is surrounded by children like Hariti (a characteristic also of Ambika and Bhavani), but she wears the trident of Siva which otherwise is never found as an emblem of Hariti. May we thus interpret the statue as a former Hariti image already changed into the Great Mother goddess who today is venerated all over the Himalaya as Chamunda, though also under number of other names? About the find place of the lingam nothing is known. Though generally of the Kashmirn type, it may as well have come from the Panjab then ruled by the early Hindu Sahis. Possibly the " Gandharan" costume of Parvati may point in such a direction. But from the eighth to the early tenth century Eastern Afghanistan was under the control of Kashmir, and the Sahis continued to have close relations with Kashmir until their overthrow by Sultan Mahmud of Ghaznia. Even queen Didda, to whose reign we attribute the lingam, was a Sahi from her grandfather's side. Thus the problem is not very important. 4 The Rajatarangini attributes its foundation to Asoka. But this is in contradiction to all we know about Asoka's religious policy. This may, however, have been different under his successor in Kashmir, Jalauka, to whom many Saiva sanctuaries are ascribed. 5 A.Foucher, op. cit., fig. 487; H.Ingholt, Gandharan Art in Pakistan, New York 1 957, fig. 3 I . 279</page></plain_text>
