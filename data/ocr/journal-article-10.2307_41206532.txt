<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Biologist Looks at War Paul A. Zahl THE origin of strife or warfare - be it aggressive, de- fensive or rebellious - we must look back a billion or so years, when the great mist shrouds were rolling aside enough to let sunlight through, and life was beginning to stir on this planet. The first clearly defined life on earth consisted of single cells, almost identical to some of the unicellular algae found today as "living fossils" teeming in any stagnant pond or in any tide pool. In those primordial days, when microscopic single-cell creatures were the sole inhabitants of the earth, there was no such thing as social organization. The social sense - that is, individual subservience to group well-being - had not yet appeared. Each single cell was an absolute and autonomous individual. It breathed for itself, it ate for itself, metabolized for itself, and reproduced for itself. The only strife possible in such a world was that between individuals. But individuals in those days had developed no weapons; indeed, why should they, since the procurement of food was not competitive? Most of the organisms derived their energy photosynthetically from sunlight; and there must have been much microscopic jostling and pushing on the part of those quasi-motile cells to get into the energy-bearing beams which in increasing intensity were filtering through the ever- thinning cloud banks. This, then, was the first sort of " warfare " on earth - a warfare hardly worthy of the name. The principle may be il- lustrated in the laboratory by placing some of these living Arche- φ In 1936, PAUL A. ZAHL joined Caryl Haskins in setting up the Haskins Labora- tories in New York.

Only those cells which can make their way into the energy-carrying beam will thrive and reproduce. When the available light space is congested, a contest ensues; and only those maintaining their positions will survive. The prime signifi- cance of this behavior lies in the fact that it is not directed by one individual seeking to destroy another, and that in it there is no element of conquest or subjugation. The individual cell of the Archeozoic had means for slow locomotion, but it had no weapons: no fangs, tusks, horns or claws. It was only when life set aside the concept of individualism as its sole guiding principle and began to experiment with the social idea, that warfare in its more literal sense began to develop. This experimentation with the social idea came about in a curious way; for in those days there seems to have been a " choice " possible between two fundamental ways of life. One lured the microbial inhabitants of the planet to stay as they were: to remain individualistic, autonomous, non-cooperative. Many, in fact most, of those primitive creatures heeded this call; and today, about a billion years later, their direct descendants are the single- cell animals and plants which every high school student of biology has seen under his microscope. But their choice of individualism carried with it the penalty of unchanging social stability. They developed no higher. Other single cells, in those pre-ancient days when life was choosing sides, elected to cooperate with one another, dared to sell their autonomy for a group fidelity. These became the an- cestors of present-day multicellular plants and animals, including man. Indeed, the origin of emergent evolution on this planet lies in the "choice" on the part of these first microorganisms to socialize into cell groups of two, four, eight, sixteen, etc. As the millions of years rolled by, and the earth went through its geological upheavals, and the forces of variation and selection spotlighted themselves on earth's new living matter, these group- ings became larger and functionally more complicated - some of the cells specializing in reproductive functions, others in excre- tory, communicative, muscular, digestive. Great physiological 19</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR labor unions, led by powerful chemical organizers, set themselves up within each multicellular organism; and cells, in functioning according to their appointed specialties, most frequently became altered in structure as well. This grouping and specialization proclivity led the myriad citizens of each cell society so far up the road toward self-renunciation and division of labor that there came to be buried deep in every gene of every cell of every body a compulsion which drove it to an unquestioning willingness to accept its particular type of subjugation, to become a one-job specialist, a voiceless member of a teeming cooperative internally regulated with inexorable severity. With the exploitation of the social possibility among evolving cells, came the abandonment of light as a primary source of energy.* No animals above the social protozoan Volvox retained photosynthesis as a source of food. At this crucial point in evolu- tion, therefore, animals began preying on one another for suste- nance. And with the new and deadly free-for-all came the need for predatory and defensive struggle. To meet the challenge of competition for food, the first animals developed within their primitive multicellular bodies a new type of cell specialization. Throughout the stormy course of evolution, while some of the body cell-citizens were being regimented into innocuous enough intestine cells, or liver cells, or nerve cells, others were constrained to develop into, say, enamel cells - and sharp and dangerous teeth appeared in the jungles and forests of the previously peaceful planet. Still others became specialized * It is true, on the other hand, that most single-cell animals (amoebae, paramecia, and the like) and many single-cell plants (bacteria, yeasts) living today have also abandoned light as a source of energy. The protozoa sprang originally from the earliest algae line, as did the bacteria; and many of them, in addition to abandoning photosynthesis, have during the subsequent course of evolution undergone marked differentiations in structure within their single-cell bodies. Further- more, the survival success of the single-cell bacteria and protozoa, in the face of environmental upheavals occurring on all sides during the last billion years, gives fairly unequivocal evidence that individualism in terms of survival is biologically just as efficient as is socialization. But with the rejection of the social idea, they have not risen (except intracellularly) above the single-cell organ- isms from which they are derived. Many of them have developed within their single-cell bodies weapon structures which give (hem aggression advantages over the other microbes on which they prey as a source of food. Some protozoa have even devised a type of defensive chemical warfare, involving the excretion into the surrounding medium of materials, non-toxic to themselves, but lethal to predators. This principle has also been used successfully as a defensive agent among some of the multi-cellular organisms, most notable, perhaps, being the mold, PuticilHum. 2O</page><page sequence="4">A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT WAR into tough hide - as an antidote to the teeth of any attacking foe. In the great struggle for existence which (since the rejection of light as a primary energy source and the quasi-acceptance of the social idea) has characterized animal life on this planet, there came an incredible array of horns, claws, talons, teeth, beaks, fangs, poison glands, stings; and finely integrated nervous systems with which to direct the use of these weapons. Defensive struc- tures developed in parallel or in step-wise fashion. And with a fury - warfare was introduced on this planet. The higher plants, as multicellular aggregates having chosen the sedentary way of life, did not develop weapons of aggression. There was no need to, since plants continued to obtain their vital energy from sunlight. The only aggression to be found among plants or trees is of the same sort exhibited by the earliest algae - that is, struggle for optimal light or struggle for optimal water or soil chemicals. "Warfare" among the higher multicel- lular plants, therefore, as among the lower single-cell plants, con- sists only of crowding and pushing. One sees dogwood crowding out some of the lowlier plants in a field; or weeds competing for the soil in which the lawn should grow. This competition, even though it does involve starvation and death for some of the com- petitors, is only circumstantial and positional. It was the need for seeking food, and the consequent develop- ment of more efficient mechanisms for locomotion, that led the multicellular animals to select weapons of aggression, and to engage in food-seeking strife with one another. Such struggle characterizes all organisms whose sources of nutrient are the devoured tissues of other animals and plants. Herbivorous animals are in constant "aggression" against the grasses which grow on the hillsides or plains. This is the most one-sided "warfare" known. Carnivores, on the other hand, prey on other animals, usually on those whose armaments are not as effectively developed as their own. The tiger, for example, will not prey on another equally armed tiger (except, perhaps, during sexual competition). He chooses rather to prey on the fawn or the pig, or on some less armored creature. This too, then, is pitifully one-sided warfare. Preparation pays off well in nature. 21</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Warfare at this level of evolution consists, then, of aggressive or defensive strife between single animals, and is motivated pro- verbially by a compulsion for individual survival, induced by the need for food. This truism must be re-interpreted, however, if one begins viewing the animal body as a society of billions of cells, regimented and organized into complex systems and organs. When considered in this light, the phenomenon of a tiger, attacking a fawn becomes the most consummate type of social warfare possible; for the tiger's body is in reality a state of cell-specialists keyed and geared for absolute conquest. Millions of enamel cell-citizens of the tiger- state lie prepared as an ever-ready arsenal for spearheading the attack. If the aggressed-upon fights back, he will have to piercethe close-rank cells which constitute the tiger's tough hide or the rep- tile's hard scaly armor. Each living organism-state has regimented a large proportion of its cell-citizens into war machinery, and is always on the alert for opportunistic or defensive warfare. In- deed, the spectrum of life, as seen in any zoo, represents the most ghastly armament race this planet has ever seen. Each animal species living today obviously has survived because its specialized cell battalions have equipped it advantageously over some other species, and its defense legions have been equally successful against its natural enemies. In addition to aggression and defense among animals, there is yet another type of warfare which can occur only within highly integrated cell societies - that is, civil rebellion on the part of some of the component cell-citizens against the society of which they are supposed to be cooperating members. This warfare is quiet, insidious and deadly. Occasionally, for reasons not at all understood, a few cells somewhere in the organization come to have a weird, perhaps chromosomal-memory flashback to the days a billion years ago when they existed as free individuals in warm Archeozoic seas. Or perhaps the controls within the body become relaxed or defective. In any case these dissenting cells recall the good old days when there was no subjugation, no regimentation - when cells divided and metabolized constantly and freely, unlike their behavior in the body-state, where cells 22</page><page sequence="6">A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT WAR may divide and metabolize only at a rate and in a manner pre- scribed by the control agencies. This nostalgia may, at length, overcome the previous*"fidelity which the cells have had to the group, and they begin yielding and acting like their single-cell ancestors, casting aside the laws of benign subjugation under which they had been serving in the body. The possibility for cells to organize into regimented state- bodies has been abroad on the planet since the early Archeozoic, a billion years ago. But always there have been internal back- sliders to individualism, fully capable in their malingering of destroying the whole organization. Cancer may occur in plants, in fish, in birds, in amphibia, in mammals - right across the board. And statistics show that among human beings one out of every seven must die, a victim to this type of internal warfare. II We have said that far back in the misty origins of life on this planet certain cells abandoned individualism as a principle for living and began socializing into groups. And that with the pass- ing of time these groups of de-individualized cells became larger and more complex, and more and more tightly regimented, until today they exist as walking societies of myriad subjugated cell- citizens, cooperating to form what we know as ant, mouse, dog, man. Each organism is a composite individual, itself consisting of a billion or more de-autonomized individuals. Relatively late in the history of living things on the earth, this trend toward collaboration has given evidence in three notable instances of beginning to manifest itself in another way. Certain organisms - themselves tightly regimented masses of specialized cells - have set themselves up into yet higher social groupings. This " second-phase " socialization has begun to express itself among only three animal groups, not at all among the plants. Lowest on the evolutionary ladder to exhibit it are certain members of the jellyfish phylum which have banded together into quasi-tribal units. For example, the Portuguese-man-of-war - an ultra-jellyfish - is in reality a tribal unit consisting of sev- eral jellyfish individuals which have joined up into one co- 4</page><page sequence="7">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR ordinated whole· A specialization, in both function and structure, has occurred - so that one component member is concerned with keeping the tribe afloat, another with reproduction, another with capturing and digesting food, etc. Yet, the composite of these former individuals - now but component parts, with little of their former independence and autonomy remaining - has become the greater individual. The next appearance of this second-phase type of socialization is among certain of the insects. Ants and bees have developed a social compulsion which natural philosophers since the time of Solomon have described in anthropomorphic terms. So well known are these ants-and-men analogies, that little more need be said about the social insects than that they have impressed upon themselves a regimentation entailing sharp division of labor, centralized control, and true mass warfare. These two groups, then - the social jellyfish and the social insects - somewhere along the course of their evolution made a fundamental decision analogous to that of the earliest algae: desertion of individualism in favor of socialization. And man is the third and highest animal species to experiment with the second-phase type of socialization. The whole thing looks like a grand cyclicity of which, in our purblindness, we can see only two phases. The first - a possi- bility for cells to de-individualize and integrate themselves into regimented organisms, called bodies. The second - a possibility for the multicellular bodies so produced, also to de-individualize and become integrated into social organisms, called societies. With this second phase of social emergence, bloodshed con- tinues to keynote life. For between societies there exists a survival- tension, just as there has perennially existed a survival-tension between individuals. There is strife among small social groups, strife among highly organized states. In its least complicated aspect, this element of group strife is almost wholly motivated by the struggle for survival in com- petition for food sources. In its more complicated aspect, strife among social groups also has a basic " economic " compulsion, leading often to pressures which impel conquests to acquire 24</page><page sequence="8">A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT WAR resources possessed by neighboring states. But in addition there have appeared some other motivating elements, whose nature is obscure, and which may exist as reflections of a vague group egoism or desire for aggrandizement of the greater whole. As corollaries to such quasi-egoistical wars of conquest, come wars of revolution. For a group, having engaged in successful conquest, has most often in human history failed to integrate its new subjects into a non-irritating pattern. In cases where the victor-subject complex follows conquest, almost always the subject groups will strive to throw off the yoke, in the hope of setting up new group organizations with new sets of social ideals. In its most complicated aspect, the element of strife arises de novo from within presumably stabilized groups; that is, if special ideological peculiarities develop (cause unknown, like that of cancer) within an organized group to the point where internal pressures become intolerable, then anarchistic movements will be initiated to overthrow the dominant state form, leading often to chaos in the entire set-up. While all these types of warfare and their defense corollaries are to be found among and within human social groups, be they of tribal or of empire dimensions, only wars of conquest and subjugation have been observed among the social insects. Revolu- tion and civil war are not to be found there, probably because in this group a dissenting or reverting individual, having from birth been deprived of its reproductive powers, cannot multiply into any sort of revolting group. In addition, psychological rap- port has not developed to a high enough degree among the social insects to permit proselytization of conforming citizens. Any individual, therefore, choosing to resist the dictates of the colony- state, becomes a lone deserter, and so having lost the protective and nutritional advantages of colony membership, perishes, alone and forgotten. The state goes on undisturbed. The lowest colonial forms - jellyfishes - have not been studied in sufficient detail to warrant speculation as to whether their existence involves warfare of types other than those of food acquisition and defense. It should perhaps be noted that such gregarious manifestations as a flock of birds, a school of fish, or a herd of buffalo, are, accord- 4</page><page sequence="9">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR ing to our present definition, not social, for among them there has been no subjugation of the individual. These loose groupings must be considered broadly in the same social category as a forest of trees or a culture of teeming bacteria. They represent merely companies of individuals thrown together because of a common birth locale or because of a .common food source, and held to- gether by a vague sort of species recognition which we call gre- gariousness. There is no organization among the component individuals of such associations, little or no division of labor, little or no selfless contribution to the common good. As a consequence, there can be no group warfare among such gregarious non-social species. A herd of buffalo has never charged another herd of buf- falo, nor has one flock of crows attacked another flock of crows. A group of big fish attacking a group of smaller fish is not warfare, in the usually accepted sense of the word, for no organizational or concerted effort is involved. Each individual of the school is subserving only its own predatory ends. Such phenomena as those typified by adult musk-oxen encircling their young when threatened by predators, are purely sexual protective patterns. Ill We have said that among all multicellular animals, only a few so far in evolution have begun responding, in its secondary aspect, to the deepseated lure for individuals to sell their auton- omy for a broader social fidelity. And we have said that these second-phase social experimenters, like their first-phase cellular prototypes, live in a perpetual milieu of organized strife - against each other, against foreign species. Such resemblances between the first and second phases of social life among evolving organ- isms, as well as the many other more functional similarities, sug- gest a close relationship between the two phases of what appears to stand out as an age-long social cyclicity among living things. The first phase has been essentially completed for many organ- isms. The second phase has been entered by but three groups. May we, as actuaries do, postulate the course of an uncom- pleted cycle from the shape of a completed preceding or parallel cycle? Do we analogically thus have a means for setting down a 26</page><page sequence="10">A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT WAR reasonable guess as to man's social future and the meaning and denouement of his perennial wars? With due awareness of the pitfalls of analogical thinking, it is of interest to probe the course of future events as suggested by such an analogy. The human species has during the last 5000 years just begun to pass into its second social phase. It has certainly not advanced very far as yet, when compared to the absolute regimentation attained by cells within the multicellular body prototype, or even to the social insects which elected their second phase some mil- lions of years ago. Nevertheless, the Hitler-Haushofer aspiration appeared to point in the direction of absolute social control of the individual, as do some other present-day ideologies. The down- fall of Caesar, the dissolution of the Alexandrine state, the col- lapse of Nazi and Japanese hopes - these should not delude us into comfortably believing that human society is incapable ulti- mately of absolute regimentation - or that, indeed, it can't happen here. These notorious attempts at de-individualizing masses of people into tightly controlled socio-military organizations may merely have been abortive symptoms of a pressure which through- out history has been on the threatening increase, but which could not exploit itself fully until mass communication had reached a higher degree of effectiveness. The emergence of the nerve method of communication and the endocrine principle of cell and tissue control were the two great evolutionary innovations which underlay the exploitation of first-phase socialization among cells during the last billion years. In the modern human era, with its rapidly evolving techniques for communication and mass idea control, perhaps man has found an analogously effective touch- stone for hurrying his gene-inherent propensity toward second- phase socialization. Neanderthal man and his collaterals fifty thousand years ago were largely individualists. Four and three thousand years ago, with the incipience of spoken and written language, man came to bind himself into loosely organized groups. Two and one thousand years ago, he was impelled to agglutinate himself into cities, na- tions and empires, with harbingers of division of labor and de- individualization becoming clearly evident. Today, we see him 27</page><page sequence="11">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR ostensibly resisting regimentation and praying for " freedom " and " individualism "; but we also see what appears to be an irresistible trend toward constantly increasing labor organization and specialization, toward restriction of the individual's previous autonomy, toward a regimentation growing tighter and tighter - paradoxically in the name of freedom, and often under the banner of democracy. In the present world scene we see the human population of the planet divided into several score of national groups, which, during inter-bellum periods, are kept from one another's throats only by temporary armament balances. History draws the ghastly picture of how these balances are upset; how the spear defeated the club, the bow and arrow defeated the spear, the musket the bow and arrow . . . right down to the present atomic bomb and its obsoletizing effect. How similar all this seems to the armament race among animals during the last billion years of evolution, and to the arsenal review which is every natural history museum. The nations of the earth - the multi-human organisms - are, like the animal organisms before them, all struggling for self- preservation, although generalized economic motives have most often replaced the specific food motive. With the emergence and demonstrable effectiveness of technology, most of the nations are becoming more highly regimented and armed; or if not armed, they are at least in the "protective" sphere of some powerful organization which is. That a good fighting organism must be internally regimented and tightly directed has become a military as well as a biological truism. The competitive nation-organisms have since the dawn of social history progressively become fewer, larger and more socialistically complex - until now, in the middle of the twentieth century, almost all have been absorbed into a few powerfully opposed dominant groupings. These seem to be sparring for the final position of single dominance in the world. One has but little doubt that there will be at least one more large-scale war between the last two dominant political set-ups - both fighting blindly, both driven by the same fundamental urges, both motivated by essentially the same ends. From the handwriting on the biological 28</page><page sequence="12">A BIOLOGIST LOOKS AT WAR wall, as well as from the utterances of many liberal political philosophers, these sparrings and probable convulsions may be interpreted as pointing toward an ultimate One-World state. What advocates of the One-World state have perennially failed to appreciate is that achievement and maintenance of this end- point in man's social evolution would involve control and regi- mentation of the component groups and citizens to a degree which might at length approach that found among the cell-citizens, the tissue-agencies, the organ-bureaus, and the system-departments of the cellular organism. Are we, after a mere five thousand years of social emergence, seeing human society entering its last pre-One- World spasm? Is the world going into the One-Organism condition, with its sine qua non of de-individualization and regimentation? Are the liberal thinkers who dream of the glorious and peaceful One World promulgating a social organism in which individual "free- dom" would be a controlled and issued commodity? Are they unwitting spokesmen for the great trend in biological heritage toward de-autonomy and internal control? If the answer to these questions lies in the affirmative , then during the years and centuries to come - slowly passing out of the social womb - will arise a vast, integrated, planetary society: the One World, finely regimented, its citizenry happy and contented in the same sense that cells in the body are happy and contented. With the final attainment of this highest level of social organiza- tion, there could be no further wars of conquest or aggrandize- ment, for there would be no enemy or competitor nations with whom to fight. On the other hand, even though wars of conquest were obviated, the one dangerous strife possibility remaining in the brave new world would be that of social cancer - analogous to the reversion to primitive individualism which may occur among the cell-citizens of the animal body. Cure for this, however, would come, along with man's understanding of the now-hidden social forces which play on human society: just as surely as will a cure for clinical cancer be achieved in a far less remote future, when more has become known about the chemo-social forces within the body. 29</page><page sequence="13">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR The human being of that millennial day will presumably have grown socially, biologically and subjectively to understand him- self - with a new set of values, motivations and illusions replacing the inconsistent and schizophrenic ones of today. It is evident that faith, religion and illusion are characteristics of the human mind, and not quantitative entities. It is hardly correct to say that they, during their long dominance in human thought, have failed. They, in fact, led us into what we now designate as science and rational- ism. Nor are science and rationalism anything but further char- acteristics of the human mind. These too will maturate. Out of the chaos which technology has seemingly created in this present- day world, may ultimately come a most consummate level of order. Perhaps with the flowering of science, the life-span of the human individual will be extended indefinitely, and individual reproduction controlled both in quantity and quality. Perhaps man's primitive curiosity and self-consciousness, having passed through various stages of pragmatic science and arbitrary morals, will at length emerge onto a level of creative illumination, tem- pered to the individual, tempered to the group. Perhaps the One World will have become the One Organism. But, while all this is going on, what if man runs amuck - and atomic warfare breaks out? Would not the resulting devastation cause all scientific research and spiritual aspiration to be stopped permanently in its tracks? One's optimistic reaction to this com- monly expressed fear springs from the hope that although man may wreck a considerable portion of his civilization in one or more of his Armageddons, his inherent will to survive should prevent him from committing acts or releasing energies which might lead to mass or cultural suicide. If the answer lies in the negative ... if the social manifestations of man and the lower organisms are unrelated; and if, in fact, there exists a transcendent or supra-biological element affecting man's destiny - then there is no rational basis for insight into his future or into the meaning and denouement of his wars. 30</page></plain_text>
