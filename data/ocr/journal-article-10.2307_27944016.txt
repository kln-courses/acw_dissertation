Downers Grove, IL: Inter Varsity Press, 1994. 176 pages plus notes. $12.99, Paper. (Reviewed by J. Harley Chapman, William Rainey Harper College) Behold, [we are] doing a new thing" is the text that five evangelical scholars might have chosen to describe their work issuing in The Openness of God: A Biblical Challenge to the Traditional Understanding of God. This volume is comprised of five essays, one by each author, which together lays out a new model, so they believe, for understanding God and the Christian life. Their jointly held conviction is that this model is closer to what committed Christians already live by and assume in devotional practice what ever their theological convictions, which have often been mis-shapen anyway by the biblical-classical synthesis. They see their position as lying between classical theism and process theism, accepting both the classical affirmation of the ontological independence of God and the process-theological emphasis on the relationality of all things and the responsiveness of God to each creature. To their credit, the essayists do not attempt to build their case through proof-texting, polemics, or syllogistics. Their reading of intellectual history is generally accurate; their treatment of process thought specifically is informed and fair. Their primary challenge is to those accepting the traditional view of God as the simple, impassible, immutable, foreordering, and fore knowing Deity presumed to be speaking in the Bible. Doubtless the greatest interest will be generated in circles where debates still continue between Calvinists and Arminians, between predestinarians and free-will advocates, and between believers in specific sovereignty and upholders of general sovereignty. Some readers may see this new proposal as a mildly interesting but largely anachronistic response to debates that should have been concluded long since. I will take the approach that the issues raised when generalized are intrinsically interesting and worthy of critical appraisal. The first essay, "Biblical Support for a new Perspective," by Richard Rice, attempts to show that reading the Bible through the traditional lens of</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 18, No. 1, January 1997 101 God-as-Monarch?all-determining, sovereign, aloof, glorious?hardly does justice to the welter of biblical passages which depict a God who is dynam ically involved in history, emotionally engaged as a lover sensitive to the feelings of his [sic] creatures even to the point of suffering, frustrated and disappointed when human decisions thwart his loving intentions, and adjusting his plans ("repenting") according to the responses of his creatures. The upshot is a God who is personal, historical, social, sensitive, and powerful primarily in a relational-responsive way. To the question "Why hasn't the biblical God been interpreted this way?" John Sanders answers with a historical treatment showing how the lens of Greek philosophy?divinity as aloof, self-sufficient perfection; eternity as timelessness; the impersonal and the abstract as more real than the personal and the concrete?distorted the picture. The resulting biblical-classical synthesis accepted the Greek ideal of impassibility, immutability, and timeless perfection and applied it to the God of the Bible. The real God was the trans cendent deity, and the immanent God whose historical involvements with persons was expressed in images of intense emotional reaction (anger, delight, disappointment, jealousy, suffering, etc.) was considered an anthropomorphic accommodation to simple folk and not seen as theological truth. In one sense this was a brilliant solution in that it could make sense of Christianity in the Greco-Roman culture, allowing for the religious imagery to have its powerful effect on people's imagination and feelings and at the same time satisfying their minds with the best intellectual options of the time. But the solution was schizophrenic and created theological monstrosities: a super-mind knowing the future as actual thereby insuring theological determinism; divine aloofness; coercive power as normative; divine love lacking real feeling; irrationality if not caprice in divine choice, and so forth. The open view of God would jettison the abstract philosophical elements in favor exclusively of the model of biblical personalism and would interpret God's eternity as God's omnitemporality, replacing God's reputed immutability with God's covenant faithfulness, God's impassibility with God's deep involvement with human suffering, and divine foreknowledge with God's intentions, stipulations, and warnings. In one sense this is not new since biblical-theological movements tend periodically to throw the Hellenizing rascals out. However, all the contributors have deeply reflected on both ancient</page><page sequence="3">102 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ philosophy and contemporary process thought. Furthermore, a number of influential Christian philosophers have lent their talents to the program. Clark Pinnock gathers up these concerns and expresses them irenically in a systematic statement that emphasizes the dynamic and social nature of reality, the genuine openness of the future, the libertarian freedom of human agents, and the responsiveness of God. His statement is underpinned by some variant of philosophical personalism and social trinitarian metaphysics. God's differentiated inner life of love issues in and displays itself in a world of creatures which, at least at the human level, are normed by love. William Hasker provides a philosophical explication of the issues in the open view of God, especially divine temporality, knowledge, power, and providential governance, and attempts to show the superiority of this model to several competing models. Specifically, he considers theological determinism (Calvinism), whereby God knows the future because He ordains it; the theory of middle knowledge (Molinism), whereby God knows what would happen with each possible alternative; the view of simple foreknowledge, whereby God has complete knowledge of the future as actual; and process thought, with its inherent unknowability of many future events and strict limitations about Divine intervention in the world. Finally, David Basinger provides an essay on the practical impli cations of the open view, specifically with regard to petitionary prayer, divine guidance, human suffering, social responsibility, and evangelism. What emerges here and throughout the volume is a reflective portrayal of an outlook set forth with candor and attractiveness not as the only responsible model but as one which is coherent, plausible, and helpful for practical living. It is exciting to see evangelical scholars engaged in serious, open, and intellectually challenging theology, proffering a significant theory to a broad public for appraisal. Accepting the challenge, I wish to begin with a consider ation of the evangelical linchpin: biblical hermeneutics. A wide range of biblical passages is taken into account, not in a defensive adduction of proof texts to batter down a theological opponent but in a manner of providing a biblical portrait of the dynamically involved God. This approach uncovers some interesting data (such as Yahweh as a vocalist?Zeph. 3:17). It further agrees with the way a scripture functions in the imagination of an adherent of a religious viewpoint: images and ideas cluster, coalesce, and mediate between sensibility, conviction, and action.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 18, No. 1, January 1997 103 As a theological strategy, however, this hermeneutic tends to suppress important biblical voices: voices?in the plural. Current biblical scholarship of whatever stripe emphasizes the diversity rather than the unity of the materials partly because it is believed that each element is due a careful, un biased hearing. Not all theologies present in the Scriptures line up; some are antithetical to others. Attempting to ferret out the biblical position and then harmonizing contrary or even contradictory passages is hardly the best her meneutical approach. For example, not all the Hebrew scriptures see the Davidic kingship and covenant in the same light; some genres are committed to certain philosophical outlooks (apocalyptic with its historical determinism) which vary from the outlook of other genres, as the libertarian freedom presupposed in parable and exhortation. Even if it should be argued that Scripture is uniformly about one deity passionately involved with humankind, still to be resolved is the issue of pluralism/henotheism/monotheism even within the pages of the sacred text. Nor does Scripture uniformly depict this God as always faithful (Jeremiah's "deceitful brook," the Psalmist's charge of covenant forgetfulness, and the Markan Jesus' cry of dereliction); nor as always fair and above manipulation ("testing" his followers, condoning chicanery for desired ends, heaping coals of fire on heads); nor as always above pique and wounded vanity (the demands for praise, and "I will get me honor upon Pharaoh"); nor not given to splenetic outbursts (the fulminations against the "abominations" of the unfaithful, the demands for purity); nor avoiding displays of emotional instability ("You almost moved me to destroy him [Job] without cause"). Modern personality theory and contemporary literary criticism look for undeveloped, complex, negative, and contradictory elements in person alities. Lacking such, we are left with unattractive, unbelievable, and flat characters with whom we can neither identify, be moved by, nor even love. Since our authors believe that the future is open and the Biblical God has beliefs about the future but does not know it as settled fact, he can be surprised. But they are sure he cannot be perplexed. Presumably he can risk his authority in sharing power with his creatures but cannot give up his cognitive composure. How do they know this? To pull back from some less than-flattering personality traits and some shaky cognitive stances as not worthy of God (the scholastic dignum Deo) is to fall into the trap into which the biblical-classical synthesis fell: any emotional expression attributed to God</page><page sequence="5">104_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ which did not square with the prior and accepted image of God is seen as anthropopathic and not properly attributable to Deity. Let God have his shadow. Adjunct to this is an implied cognitive view of metaphor or symbol: images give us information about the subject. Open-view theists eschew the pragmatic or instrumentalist view of religious language as a means by which humans engage the divine. Living metaphors and symbols do things to people; they move them, (re-) orient them, set their feet in new places, and create new hearts in them. Accenting the cognitive, consciously or not, the open-view approach tends toward literalism: God really (literally) is a person; God really (literally) is disappointed at human failure; God really (literally) will divide humanity into two groups; God really (literally) is a supermind and knows what is going on with everybody and everything. The issue of what is literal and what is metaphorical or symbolic is a vexed one, of course. It is probably the case that a neat cut on the literal metaphorical continuum can never be decisively made. By its very nature, theory, which theology aims at, urges toward the univocal use of language in its drive toward a cognitively unifying grasp of reality. Yet we increasingly realize that all theory is shot through with inexpungeably imaginative ele ments. Perhaps the issue is not primarily epistemological but axiological: what ultimately are the values that an intellectual structure wishes to enshrine, protect, reveal, and advance? What finally is least?or not at all?negotiable when we look reality in the face? It is clear that the open view ultimately holds to a conviction that there is literally a divine person, a subject with a moral character, acting in history, interacting with other persons living out their historical destinies. For this position, this is non-negotiable. Expressions of God's "body parts" (arms, hands, face, eyes, ears, heart, etc.) are taken as symbolic; God as historical agent is not. But is this necessarily the best interpretation? I think not, for at least three reasons: (1) the moral ambiguity in the biblical language about the divine already alluded to above but not likely acceptable to the open view; (2) the incontrovertible evidence of the mystical in human experience, including the Christian tradition; (3) eternity as dynamic reality productive of temporality but not as an abstraction from time, which is affirmed in part because of (2). It is a serious theological mistake to interpret God's transcendence as an</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 18, No. 1, January 1997 105 abstraction from the concrete, temporal, historical world. The Greek mind did not by abstraction create transcendence. God's transcendence is affirmed primarily because humans have experienced centrally or peripherally a reality of infinite worth that transcends everything of earthly importance?time, history, personhood, and morality. Many mystics, many religious persons, some philosophers, even some secular persons acknowledge this, which insight prevents a facile identification of the divine with history, time, personhood, or morality. It requires the taking of religious language with imaginative flex ibility, playfulness, and penultimacy. It prevents abstracting from the concrete and calling the resulting abstraction transcendence or eternity. This is not to claim that mystics and others do not use the abstractions of language to express themselves, and necessarily so. I must admit that I have not made a counter case; I have only sug gested why the case presented does not account for all the important data that theologians should be working with. Theologians must worry not only about interpreting biblical language, and doing it well, but also must trouble them selves about the wide range of human experience?historical, scientific, moral, personal, religious, mystical, and the like. The proponents of the open view have made an interpretive advance relative to the theological positions which they considered. It is to be hoped that their explorations will continue.</page></plain_text>
