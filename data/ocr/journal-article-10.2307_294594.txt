<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY narrative to site descriptions was impractical. "The audience he had in mind did not exist" (p. 22). Chapter two demonstrates Pausanias' value as a guide beginning with the famed description of Mycenae which led Schliemann to dig within the Lion Gate. Short sections follow on Troezen, Kallipolis, and Onchestus. The bulk of this chapter is devoted to Messene. Orlandos' excavations there beginning in 1957 provide a model test case revealing both Pausanias' method (he moves systematically through a site) and his great usefulness to archaeologists in interpreting their findings. Habicht here carries the discussion of the Asclepieium further with a masterful treatment of the sculptor Damophon (pp. 45-57)-a figure known to us at all, as Habicht properly emphasizes, only because of Pausanias' careful record. He concludes that Damophon and, therefore, the Asclepieium must belong to the years 180-160. The fourth chapter examines Pausanias as an historian. He was a widely read person who wrote history from memory; "this method accounts for most of his errors" (p. 98). The historical narration always arises from a site or monument and is intended to complement the guide. One ought not, then, to view him as a critical historian seeking ultimate causes. Habicht discerns in Pausanias a patriot who cared devoutly for the freedom of Greece-see his acute discussion of Pausanias' list of national benefactors on p. 113. In the final two chapters we are offered a view of a man who enjoyed the security of his age and who, while he shared its interest in the past, pursued his researches with a seriousness of purpose which sets him apart from the shallow sophists and compilers who typify the period. Habicht elicits from Pausanias' long and detailed opus a portrait of a serious scholar who loved his ancient homeland and labored hard to preserve a record of her past for posterity. Pausanias has found in him a most sympathetic reader, perhaps a trifle too sympathetic. Still, it is not possible to fault the general line of Habicht's assessment. This will be, and deserves to be, the standard work in English on Pausanias. S. V. TRACY THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY B. C. DIETRICH, Tradition in Greek Religion. Berlin, de Gruyter, 1986, Pp. xvi + 213. In this brief but dense text Dietrich restates his views of the develop- ment of Greek religion from the neolithic to the archaic, with occasional forays, in default of good earlier evidence, as late as the Roman period. Although, as in his Origins of Greek Religion, abundant material from all parts of the Aegean world is introduced, the prime locus here is Cyprus, religiously 280</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS conservative but yet a melting pot of Eastern, Minoan, Mycenaean, and later mainland influences. After arguing for the essential unity of Minoan- Mycenaean religion (Chapter 1), Dietrich then treats it (Chapter 2) as an intrusion into the development from neolithic to archaic. Rural sanctuaries, deities like Demeter, Dionysus, and Artemis, masks, phalloi, and fertility cults were widespread in neolithic times, were largely ignored in the Minoan- Mycenaean middle and late Bronze Age, but then reappeared at the collapse of these cultures to become standard features of archaic and classical religion. Also intrusive into the development was the epic, particularly Homeric, conception of anthropomorphic, highly personalized deities (Chapter 3). To this many archaic and classical deities and heroes of local cult owed their panhellenic names, their representations in sculpture, and their myths. Classical religion itself was thus a complex blend of neolithic, Minoan- Mycenaean, and Homeric, the constituent elements of which the author rather confidently sorts out. Dietrich structures his final chapter around the cult of Apollo at Kourion, founded in the eighth or seventh century B.c. and internationally prominent only in the Roman period. It is not a promising site from which to illustrate his theses, and in fact he uses it primarily as a frame upon which to hang his theories about the origins of Apollo and the development of sanctuaries, cults, and deities elsewhere on Crete and in the Aegean area. The comparative material outweighs heavily the evidence from Kourion. This results, in part, from the major new and disturbing methodological thrust in the book. Dietrich asserts repeatedly that neither continuity nor discontinuity of archaeological evidence can prove or disprove continuity of worship, of deity, or of religious content. He thus promotes the value of the general contemporary and previous religious environments for interpreting the nature and specific details of a given cult. Hence the need for vast amounts of comparative data. This profound distrust of archaeological evidence obscures the fact that the general prehistoric religious tradition itself must be established primarily through this same archaeological evidence. The suspicion arises that the author distrusts archaeological evidence only when it conflicts with his theories. This suspicion is difficult to allay and the theories themselves are, from the book itself, impossible to evaluate because the maps, site and building plans, and illustrations of votives and other artifacts necessary for critical judgment are absent, to be tracked down only through references in the voluminous notes. The reader must take it on the author's word that one sanctuary, or statue, or votive, or baetyl looks like or unlike another in significant ways, and it is upon such observations that most of the argument is based. It would seem that, given the cost of the book, at least some bits of the crucial visual evidence could have been presented. JON D. MIKALSON UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 281</page></plain_text>
