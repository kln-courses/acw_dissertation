ISBN 978-3-7774-3695-1 Reviewed by PHILIP RYLANDS Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice the collection of Jan Krugier and Marie Anne Poniatowski is acquiring celebrity. It consists of over four hundred drawings, from the fifteenth to the twentieth century, as well as modern paintings and sculptures by Rodin, Picasso, Giacometti, Fichier, Matisse, Klee, Bacon and many others. Krugier, born in 1928 in Radom, a small town near Warsaw, was a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau and of a great deal of other Nazi horror. It was poignant therefore that this collection was first exhibited in the Kupferstichkabinett, Berlin, in 1999. Soon afterwards, the collection travelled to the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, where this reviewer came to admire the connoisseur ship of the two collectors. The exhibition was entitled The Timeless Eye, inspiring the title of the subsequent exhibition at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid (Mirades sin tiempo, 2000), and of the recent exhibition in Munich,1 which was accompanied by the catalogue here under review. For each exhi bition a different curator has made different selections: an emphasis on works on paper in Berlin and Venice, for example, has yielded in the present catalogue to the presence of important modern sculpture and painting, as well as to a component of ethnic and ancient art. The Berlin and Venice catalogues (1999) have been the only ones to include a checklist of what was then the entire collection of drawings. The Krugier-Poniatowski collection is still growing, and each catalogue presents new additions. In Paris in 2002, for example, a stunning drawing by Caspar David Friedrich - a much longed-for acquisition - was presented for the first time (here cat. no.71). To two Matisse drawings recorded in the Venice catalogue in 1999, five further drawings, a painting, a collage and a sculpture by the artist have been added in Munich in 2007. There are new works by Turner, Degas, Courbet, C?zanne and Gauguin, but also by El Greco, Gentile Bellini, Pordenone, Giorgione, G.B. Tiepolo, Francesco Salviati and Watteau. This gives an idea of the range of the collection. Then again, many beautiful drawings - by Fra Bartolommeo, Andrea del Sarto, Tintor etto, Bronzino, Primaticcio, Gainsborough and Boucher, to name only a few - that were present in previous exhibitions are missing from Das ewige Auge. In other words, none of the exhibition catalogues published to date represents the complete collection. Together the various catalogues in their various languages (German, Italian, Spanish, English and French) document the growth of the collection and give a sense of its range which, singly, each catalogue does only par tially. They all draw on the same resource of lengthy and scholarly entries (beginning with the Berlin catalogue), with new entries being added as necessary. Das ewige Auge is therefore a work in progress, a living document, like its earlier companions, about collecting. Jan Krugier trained to be a painter under Johannes Itten in Z?rich. He was discouraged from this by Giacometti (in a kindly way) and by Matisse (more brusquely) and in 1962 opened his art gallery in Geneva with a show of 112 works by Giacometti. Krugier's second wife, Marie-Anne Poniatowski, is an artist in her own right. The dealer and the artist began their joint collection before 1972 with the purchase of a Seurat drawing, Wheat and trees/ Portrait of F?lix F?n?on. Poniatowski, a des cendant of the last ruling family of Poland, had inherited old-master drawings of her own. One of these (no.29) is an exquisite sanguine drawing by Parmigianino for the head of the Virgin in the National Gallery of London's Vision of St Jerome. The collection has been formed therefore from this, from an insis tent and continuing campaign of purchases, and as a spin-off of Krugier's opportunities as a dealer. Here then is a sampling of some of the draw ings in Das ewige Auge: two sheets by Gentile Bellini, The funeral procession of the Virgin Mary and a Crucifixion, both related to Jacopo Belli ni's Louvre sketchbook; a life-like nude studio assistant by Benozzi Gozzoli; a tiny V?neto landscape with a fortified town in sanguine by Giorgione, formerly in the H?vesy collection, Paris, and closely related to the Tempesta; Pon tormo's earliest known drawing, a blaze of red chalk related to the fresco of the Madonna di S. Rufillo; a pen drawing of male nudes related to Bandinelli's decorations for the Castel S. Angelo (ex-collection Kenneth Clark); a mas terpiece in pen and wash by Guercino of a Young soldier with an arquebus sayingfarewell to his father, the large, highly finished View of Cape Arkona by moonlight by Caspar David Friedrich, with all the tension and mystery of an oil and a provenance from Johann Gottfried Quistorp, Friedrich's art professor at the University of Greifswald; a sheet of figure studies, nervous insect-like creatures, by Piranesi, and fetching nude studies by Ingres for Stratonica; a tiny coloured and highly finished study by G?ri cault for The raft of the Medusa; a Degas-like pastel on canvas by Manet of a Young woman at her bath (ex-collection Mr and Mrs Henry Moore); an anthropomorphic landscape by Degas, with a reclining redheaded nude merged with a cliffscape; a quintessential Gia cometti, gift of the artist himself, of a Standing woman, the pencil so rubbed that the surface of the paper is distressed; a 1920 Self-portrait and a 1913 Metaphysical perspective by de Chirico; a large gouache and Indian ink Contrasts of forms by L?ger; and Picasso's affectionate pencil portrait of Enrico Cecchetti, master of ballet at La Scala, in the style of Ingres. Is this then an eclectic collection? Not at all. Its breadth inevitably encompasses different pockets of art history. Among the Italian old masters, Venetians seem to have been given priority in recent years, but the quattro- and Cinquecento in central Italy, Mannerists and the Ecole de Fontainebleau and Bolognese classicism are all represented; the collection continues with Rembrandt and Rubens, French classicism and Rococo, but European High Baroque is generally missing. The collec tion's centre of gravity is the nineteenth cent ury. G?ricault and Delacroix are favourites, and others among the century's giants - Goya, Ingres, Turner, Degas, Seurat, C?zanne - are represented in depth; to this can be added Hugo, Millet, Courbet, the Barbizon school, Menzel, Daumier, Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Burne-Jones and Redon (and others not shown in Munich). In the twentieth century, in addition to the canonical Kandinsky, Picasso, Matisse, Klee, Giacometti, Dubuffet and Mir?, the collection reaches as far as Rauschenberg, Bacon, and Rothko. Notable absences are German Expressionism and Surrealism. What unites a collection that includes Callot and Morandi would seem to be the collectors' eye - the quest for the purely aesthetic, timeless compo nent of drawing, and the persistendy high quality of their choices. The ambiguous Auge of the tide may be that of either the artist or the collector. The sense of an ennobled state of being ? emanating from the artist's creative imagination, his response to nature, his mastery of materials and the skill of his hand - accumu lates as one turns from one work of art to another. The collection has an ineffable warmth of optimism that brings one back to the biographical facts of Jan Krugier's youth, and his need to restore his belief in human nature and the value of existence after, for example, his family had been slaughtered in Treblinka and he had survived the death march to Bergen-Belsen at the end of the War. The ordering of the catalogue is mysterious. Often an artist's birthdate governs the order, and this can be interesting: Torres-Garcia, Klee, L?ger and Braque precede Picasso, in that order. Rodin, Redon and Monet were all born in 1840, one year after C?zanne. Hopper is sandwiched between Picasso and Beckmann. One could wish that the rule had been more rigorously applied: Hokusai (b.1760) and Hiroshige (b.1797) are grouped together after Delacroix (b.1798); Friedrich and Turner (b.1774 and 1775 respectively) correctly pre cede Ingres (b.1780), but so does Martin (b.1789). Fuseli, though five years older, is cat alogued after Goya. Nor apparently was the order governed by the date of the first entry of each artist. Some degree of interpretation must have been irresistible to the catalogue editors. This however in no way spoils the pleasure of a well-produced and scholarly book, easy to consult and beautifully illustrated. 1 The collection has also been at the Mus?e Jacquemart Andr?, Paris, as Le Passion du dessin (2002), and at the Albertina, Vienna, as Goya bis Picasso (2005). The Munich catalogue includes 238 entries by various scholars, an index of exhibitions, a bibliography and introductory texts by Jan Krugier, Marie-Anne Krugier-Poniatowski, Christiane Lange and Tomas Llorens (reprinted from the Albertina catalogue, in which the nexus between C?zanne and Picasso's Cubism as evinced by the Krugiers' drawings is discussed). The catalogue entries include provenance, bibliography and exhibition history. 338 MAY 2OO8 CL THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE</page></plain_text>
