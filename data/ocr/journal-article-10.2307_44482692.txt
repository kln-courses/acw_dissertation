<plain_text><page sequence="1">James Mayall Africa In the International System: the Great Powers in Search of a Perspective IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE AFRICAN CONTINENT HAS ALWAYS occupied an ambiguous and in the last analysis unhealthy place in the Western mind. To some its vast empty spaces have prom- ised the riches of a new El Dorado together with the piratical thrills associated with their plunder, to others the challenge of a last frontier along which to stake out and defend their interests; while for many Africa was either the dark continent, a corrupt and corrupting place, or the last stronghold of barbarism waiting upon the enlightenment, or a refuge of worldly innocence where a breed of New Men might at last transcend their own past (and ours) and build a society based not on exploitation and conflict but on social justice. In the fifteen years after 1960, the year when African states emerged almost overnight as the largest voting bloc in the United Nations, it seemed that these archetypal but embar- rassing images were gradually fading. They had been fashioned during a period of imperial supremacy when Africa could safely be regarded both in psychic terms and as a piece of real estate, as an object of desire and political competition, or as a safety valve for blowing off European steam in order to preserve the balance of power nearer home. Such romantic visions (for that is unquestionably what, in one way or another, they all were) and the attitudes which grew from them, were hardly consistent with independent African membership of a society of states whose public values included mutual recognition, national self- determination, non-interference and reciprocity. Nor did they fit easily into a world which viewed the modernization of the new states as a political imperative and as an exercise in rational and economic problem-solving. But old images, like old soldiers, die hard. In the four years since Portugal, the last of the imperial captains and the most</page><page sequence="2">350 GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION reluctant to go, finally decided on departure, four major African conflicts (one in Angola, two in Zaire and one in the Horn) have been 'settled', neither according to the principle of non-inter- ference nor by a rational attempt to resolve the substantive issues at stake but by the old-fashioned introduction of outside force. There are currently some 35,000 Cuban soldiers serving in Africa and the Soviet Union has negotiated long-term treaties of friendship and cooperation with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia in addition to the one it had already with Guinea. These changes in the political map have awakened old obsessions and reopened the whole question of Africa's place in the inter- national order. The Great Game, it seems, is not over after all: it is being replayed in Africa where we are witnessing, it is often said, the re-partition of the continent amongst the major powers. To those who always knew that the world was a wicked place, such a view may provide supporting evidence. But it is worth asking whether it is in fact true. It is a commonplace of our relativistic age that where one stands depends upon what one wants to see. Our predecessors had no such inhibitions. 'We have been witness of one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of the world', Keltie wrote in 1895, 'During the last ten years we have seen the bulk of the one barbarous continent parcelled out amongst the most civilized powers in Europe.'1 And his explanation of what was involved - land hunger - was equally unambiguous. 'It was in the nature of things [my italics] that Great Britain should try to make up for the loss of Damaraland by taking all that she could lay hands upon north of Cape Colony.'2 In 1979, alas, neither our moral nor our intellectual vision can be so un- clouded by doubt. THE NEW IMPERIALISM There is, however, no shortage of explanations of what is presently happening in Africa, each offered confidently from a different point of view. The high ground is occupied fey those who maintain that we are indeed witnessing the renewed expan- sion of the last imperial power in the classical sense, a power for whom expansion is its own reward; and that a qualitative &gt; J.

The origins of this Soviet imperialism have been variously explained. Some writers have argued that it derives from the regime's heavy dependence on an expansionist ideology for the legitimation of its centralized power structure, while Richard Pipes traces its roots to the expansion of sixteenth- and seven- teenth-century Muscovy and the foundation of the Russian state.3 Such diagnoses cannot be proved. What is known is that at the XXIV Congress of the CPSU in 1976 Premier Kosygin confirmed that the Soviet Union was intent on establishing with the developing countries 'a stable division of labour, counter- posed to the system of imperialist exploitation'.4 The countries which were singled out for special mention in connection with this policy - India, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, the UAR, Syria, Iraq and Algeria - were not selected because they had opted for 'the non-capitalist road of development' but because of their strategic and political interest to the Soviet Union and more particularly because through the expansion of trade the 'Soviet Union will receive the opportunity to satisfy the requirements of its own economy more fully'.5 The public announcement of this policy, Richard Loewenthal has argued, represents 'a dis- tinct shift from old style anti-imperialism to a new concept that can best be described as "counter imperialism" - a strategy of fighting Western imperialism by using the familiar "imperialist" methods of establishing zones of political and economic influ- ence linked to the Soviet Union by firm ties'.6 There is an obvious problem in applying this line of argument to the 'new' Soviet policy in Africa. No sub-Saharan African state and only two countries on the African continent - Egypt and Algeria - were included in the original list of mainly state capitalist countries favoured by the Soviet Union, and of these Egypt broke out of the 'reserved area of Soviet power' in July 1972, although it continues to trade substantially with the centrally-planned economies, while the proportion of 3 F.

But the World Bank's figures of their current trade with the centrally- planned economies - less than 1 per cent for Mozambique and a fall from 2 to 1 per cent for Angola between 1960 and 1976 - hardly suggest a very dramatic restructuring of either country's trade.8 In the meantime a position of influence even in countries within the capitalist orbit may conceivably help to alleviate some of the Soviet Union's own problems in its economic relations with the Western powers, while protecting its position against future shortages of raw materials. There are, we are told, precedents. In 1973 it was rumoured that the Russians had advised the OPEC countries to use the oil weapon for two reasons unconnected with the Middle East crisis. One was the Soviet oil supplied to Eastern Europe. The quadrupling of oil prices allowed the Russians to reap some windfall profits from its own sales in the open market, and since intra-bloc pricing reflects even though it does not equal world market prices, they were also able to revise upwards the price of their oil exports to their socialist trading partners.9 As a potential supplier of many other raw materials at the margin, the Soviet Union stands to gain, at the West's expense, from any general improve- ment in the developing countries' terms of trade; and as the major supplier of other bloc countries at present, the Soviet Union is bound to welcome special relations with raw material producing countries such as Mozambique and Angola against 7 See Table B., World Development Report , 1978 , The World Bank, Washington, D.C., 1978, pp. 90-1. • Ibid . * It has also been suggested that similar considerations influenced the Soviet reaction to the Group of 77 demand for increases in the prices of raw materials generally; 'if the spontaneous tendencies of the world market were unfavourable to the producers of raw materials it was again easier for the bloc countries with their state monopolies of trade to conclude bulk purchase agreements stabilizing the price for a time - provided their governments made a political decision to do so ... . It was this situation that the Soviet concept of a stable division of labour with a group of developing countries, and of an alliance with their raw material producers against the Western imperialist monopolies, emerged.'

For their part, neither the Chinese nor the South Africans, whose current views on these matters are remarkably similar, feel the need for such forensic subtlety in accounting for Soviet behaviour. 'It is obvious', as the Peking Daily put it, 'that the all round intensification of the aggressive expansionist activity of Soviet socialist imperialism in Africa, the Middle East and the Gulf dovetails with its overall strategic design, that is to outflank Western Europe in preparation for a new world war. The above-mentioned areas possess rich deposits of oil and other strategic resources vital to the survival of the West. They are strategically situated overlooking "the lifeline of the West" - the sea lanes linking the Indian Ocean with the Atlantic.'10 THE CRISIS OF CAPITALISM Such views are not so much refuted as simply ignored by those who discern not a new imperialism but the old capitalist beast as it moves in for the kill, or alternatively as it manoeuvres, its back to the wall, in an effort to avoid its own long-awaited and inevitable demise. Although the main body of the 'new' dependency theory was first elaborated by Marxist economists with reference to Latin America, the essential argument was advanced in Africa by Kwame Nkrumah. In Neo-Colonialism : the last stage of imperialism, he had maintained that the in- dependence granted by the colonial powers was false because they continued to control the economies of their former possessions, and that this neo-colonialism (i.e. false independ- ence) constituted not only the highest but the worst stage of imperialism because in contrast to the period of direct rule it allowed for the exercise of power without responsibility.11 In the years that followed the publication of this tract other writers developed the theory of African underdevelopment which they explained in terms both of Africa's structurally peripheral status in the world capitalist economy and of the emergence of an imperialist fifth column - the African Peking Review y 29 September 1978. ii K.

It is just not true that the world can be divided unambiguously between exploiters and exploited. Nor can such an act of labelling (and in the end it amounts to little more than this) dispose of all the questions which have traditionally been thought of as difficult by 'bourgeois' political theorists, such as whether governments are ever justified in intervening in each other's affairs, or why in fact they intervene in some cases and not others. Nor is it made very clear what sort of policy it would be both practicable and reasonable for a developing country to pursue, regardless of the nature of its regime, given its history and the markets which exist for its goods. Yet, when all such disclaimers have been made, even the most sceptical observer must grapple with powerful arguments along the road to the madhouse. Consider first the alleged crisis of capitalism itself. The basic argument was summarized in 1976 not by a member of the New Left but by the Chancellor of the Federal German Republic when he warned of the coming struggle for the World Product. In the aftermath of the oil crisis and in mid-recession, the importance of even marginal Third World outlets and sources of supply increased dramatically. Here indeed we are confronted by a central contradiction in the Western system, namely the coexistence of separate states within a competitive market ideology. From this point of view, more significant than the arrival of the Cubans in Africa was the way in which their presence galvanized the Western powers into both competitive and cooperative action, the desire to shore up a traditional Western preserve being balanced by the desire to secure com- petitive advantages within it. In two respects the legacies of the European imperial systems still shape the policies of independent African governments and 12 See for example, S.

Said, The Political Economy of Africa, New York, 1973.</page><page sequence="7">AFRICA IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM 355 limit the options available to them. The first stems from the divisive impact of French and British economic policy and philosophy on their former colonies; the second, almost a mirror image of the first, from the magnetic attraction of the EEC for virtually all African economies. Free trade, as Bismarck once sourly remarked, is the natural policy of the strongest power. Certainly during the days of British supremacy it was the policy preached if not always practised from London, just as, on the basis of a modified version of the same argument, the United States has been the strongest advocate of a liberal international economic order since 1945. One consequence of British economic liberalism was that although, at independence, African Commonwealth countries were generally dependent on Britain, their leaders shared the global assumptions of Anglo- Saxon economic theory. Indeed, in so far as they regarded economic control as an essential corollary of political indepen- dence, it required (they believed) diversification away from Britain.13 And in so far as they shared the general Third World aspiration for a new deal in their relations with the industrial world, they pursued this goal by demanding first the reform and then the restructuring of global international institutions. By contrast the mirror in which the French-speaking African leaders saw themselves gave back an economically more national- ist, circumscribed and parochial image. French economic policy has never - either during the colonial period or since - demon- strated the same theoretical attachment to the ideas of non- interference and non-discrimination as the basis of economic relations; rather the policy has always been designed - first under colonial law and subsequently by diplomacy - to create a protected zone of economic and political influence in which the power of the French state can be used to defend French financial and commercial interests and to secure the allegiance of the governments of francophone Africa. At independence, therefore, these governments found themselves not only more dependent on France than were their Commonwealth neighbours on Britain - they mostly produced the same commodities less efficiently - but tied intellectually as much as by interest to the French connection. i* For a discussion of British economic policies towards the African colonies during the period of the transfer of power, and of African reactions to them, see Y. Bangura, The Politics of Economic Relations between Britain and Commonwealth Africa: 195Í-1975 , Unpublished University of London Ph.D. Thesis, 1978.</page><page sequence="8">356 GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION Here then is the origin both of the conflicts of perception which have dogged intra-African relations across the language barrier since independence, and of the current activist phase of French African policy. In the early 1960s intra-Atrican differences about what constituted a neo-colonial relationship effectively removed economic relations from the agenda of African diplomacy. Despite the references to economic co- operation in the OAU Charter, the subject was hardly discussed in 1963 because of Commonwealth African hostility to the concept of association with the EEC. Yet given their commit- ment to diversification, the attraction of West European markets and Britain's declared intention of joining the Community, Commonwealth African countries could not ignore the question of association, regardless of their Afro-Saxon intellectual and political reservations. They quickly came to terms - first the Nigerians who had led the unsuccessful attack on association within the GATT, and then the three East African countries, negotiating their own preferential agreements with the Com- munity.14 The problem was not finally resolved, however, until the negotiation of the Lomé Convention in 1975. By that time the benefits of the Yaoundé Agreement, which linked all the French-speaking countries except Guinea with the Community, had been considerably eroded both by successful competition from outside the association and as a result of pressure within the EEC itself, particularly from the Netherlands and West Germany; the existing Associates were therefore more willing than they had been in the past to widen their supplicant part- nership in the hope of strengthening their collective bargaining position. Nor did they have far to look. British accession had faced Commonwealth African, Caribbean and other govern- ments with the prospect of losing their preferential position within the British market unless they reached some accommo- dation with the Community. It was fortunate for the Africans, but also fortuitous, that these contingencies arose at a time when the quadrupling of the oil price and the commodity boom of 1974-75 had impressed on the Community governments their own dependence and vulnerability: they were more The Nigerian agreement was concluded in 1966 but fell victim to the civil war and, in the Nigerian view, to French opposition.

At the time of negotiation it was widely claimed by both sides that the Lomé Convention had finally broken the vicious circle of dependency in relations between industrial and develop- ing countries. After three years the evidence does not unequivo- cally support this verdict, at least from the point of view of the Africans: imports into the Community from non-associated developing countries have continued to grow faster than from the ACP states while, despite the formal abolition of reverse preferences, the Community has turned its own trade deficit with the area into a surplus.15 It begins to look as though those who insisted that all the EEC was offering was a form of collective neo-colonialism may have had a point. Yet complaints about the working of the Convention seem unlikely to lead to a threat of African withdrawal. The plain fact is that African countries as a group are not only dependent but more dependent than other parts of the Third World. If they do not exploit their historic relationship with Western Europe they are likely to lose out to the semi-industrialized countries of the Arab world, Asia and Latin America to an even greater extent than at present. And when all is said the acceptance of Western influence, as it were under duress, is not particularly onerous for most African governments. On the one side, the revived economic nationalism of the European states offers comprador leaders such as Mobutu the opportunity of balancing their depen- dencies. On the other the provisions of the Lomé Convention are sufficiently flexible to accommodate a wide range of regimes including several, such as Benin and the Congo Republic, which are professedly Leninist, and others which quite openly employ East European and Cuban advisers in sensitive security posts. Nor, so long as the Africans negotiate under the auspices of the OAU, and the French support their opposition to a human rights clause in any new agreement,16 is anything likely to prevent Ethiopia, Uganda, the Central African Empire or is Carol Cosgrove Twitchett, Towards a New ACP-EC Convention*, World Today , December 1978, pp. 472-83. i« A human rights clause which would block transfers from the European Develop- ment Fund to offending states has been pressed by Britain and the Netherlands in particular.

All African governments, it seems, need patrons, and by acting firmly in support of 'moderate' governments at a time when Washington's reliability as a patron must be suspect the French government has successsfully exploited the uncertainty produced in Africa by the arrival of the Cubans. At the Franco- African summit in May 1978 the African states not only en- dorsed French policy in Zaire, but by-passed the OAU in setting up an allegedly Pan-African force to replace the Foreign Legion in Shaba. And six months later when President Giscard visited Conakary, the French finally returned Guinea to the fold after twenty years in the wilderness.17 All this indeed constitutes an impressive performance in the grand tradition of imperial diplomacy. But French self- confidence in Africa (and in what may justly be seen as the intra-alliance competition of the Western powers) should not distract our attention from the central point. This is simply that nowhere in Africa has the influence of the major Western powers been decisively challenged in an area where their interests are historically rooted and of perceived importance to their current economic welfare. In this sense both Ethiopia and the Portuguese colonies were marginal areas, so that even assuming that their defection is permanent, it is unlikely to establish the validity of an African domino theory. If, in other words, Nkrumah was right in his depiction of the transfer of power as a Western neo-colonial construct, the edifice still stands. THE ELEMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL ORDER Whether this conclusion can survive the transfer of power in Rhodesia and Namibia remains to be seen but if the broad argument is accepted there seems no good reason why it should not. For certainly it is in Southern Africa, above all in South Africa itself, that the Western capitalist system is most firmly m During the French President's visit it was agreed that commercial, cultural and financial agreements would be concluded within two months. Reports suggested that French firms were likely to invest with government backing in a hydro-electric complex to power a new alumina processing industry.

And South Africa is not Namibia. Yet persuasive as these arguments may seem they leave un- answered two questions which inevitaoly arise in connection with the repartition thesis. In the first place, why has Africa become a focus of international tension now? Secondly, what difference does it make that the struggle for influence is occur- ring not, as in the nineteenth century, in terra incognita but in a continent of sovereign independent states? In both cases the obvious answers are unsatisfactory. It is not in fact true that only now are crises occurring which are capable of attracting great power intervention. American policy, for example, has fluctuated over the years. During the first Congo crisis the United States established its own influence in the only way which would avoid a major confrontation with the Soviet Union, that is through the United Nations. During the Nigerian civil war, in human terms an even greater disaster, it watched passively while the Soviet Union emerged as a major armourer to the Federal side, while in Angola the Administration became deeply but ineffectively involved in a civil war which was won by the side which enjoyed Soviet patronage. Such inconsistency suggests that, at the very least, it would be prudent to look to the international system, that is to the relations of the super powers themselves, as well as to the internal well springs of Soviet and capitalist behaviour.19 Similarly, to dismiss the transfer of power on the grounds that the sovereignty and independence of African states are purely nominal, is to beg the question about the meaning of these concepts in any context. No clear meaning can be given to the concept of absolute independence and tne doctrine of sovereignty ultimately makes sense only as a claim to legitimate i® Between 1960 and 1970 South Africa's total foreign liabilities grew from R3024 million to R5818 million.

Many African states are undeniably vulnerable to external influence and penetration, but their inability to fashion the external environment in their own interests (a failure which does not differ in kind from that of political leaders in industrial societies) cannot rob them of either their political autonomy or of responsibility for their own policies, including any external ties or 'alliances' they may choose to contract. One cannot simply discount the fact that in 1960 Patrice Lumumba appealed directly to the super powers and to the United Nations for support against Belgian intervention; that in the Nigerian war the Federal government imposed a naval blockade of its own to discourage support for the secessionists and to prevent Biafra exploiting the country's oil reserves, and that in Angola the MPLA leadership successfully solicited help from the Cubans and the Soviet Union. In each case, when mobilizing external support those involved were appealing to established principles of international society. In none was it simply a matter of the Great Powers moving in without reference to African interests and in pursuit of clearly defined objectives of their own. These constructs - system and society - are both part of the Western legacy to the contemporary world. Historically, the Western state system is generally held to have rested on five institutional foundations.20 Three of these - the doctrine of sovereignty, international law and the diplomatic system - established the agreed basis of international society. This society, however, was never merely a cooperative enterprise, a kind of early forerunner of OECD or the European Community. Indeed two of its basic institutions - the balance of power and war itself - were customarily regarded as attempts to order, or at least to mitigate, all those conflictual forces including random violence which were also present in European societies. And while attempts were made to subject the practice of warfare to the law, the balance of power was always beyond the reach of the law, an essentially 'systemic' mechanism on which paradoxically the whole social and normative edifice was held to rest. System and society, in other words, were viewed as mutally dependent supports of international order.21 20 See Martin Wight, Systems of States , Leicester, 1977, particularly chapters 4, 5. 2i Professor Hedley Bull has distinguished between these two concepts in Western</page><page sequence="13">AFRICA IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM 361 AFRICA IN INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY This picture of a seemingly lost world is not I believe as anach- ronistic as at first sight may appear. Perhaps, therefore, it may even shed some light on recent events in Angola, Zaire and the Horn. In one respect, however, - the justification of inter- vention - contemporary international society differs sharply from its predecessor. So long as Western supremacy remained unchallenged, the Western powers condoned behaviour, notably conquest beyond the confines of their state system, which they would not have condoned in relations amongst themselves. After all, as Keltie put it in the passage I quoted earlier, they regarded themselves as 'the most civilised states' and Africa as the last stronghold of barbarism. But once power had been transferred, this convenient argument was no longer available: they had no choice but to extend the essentially egalitarian principles of Western diplomatic thought to the global society of states.22 And being weak, and newly released from the clutches of imperial power, it was precisely the egalitarian and legal frame- work of the international community which attracted the first generation of independent African political leaders. For example, when in 1963 they drew up the OAU charter, it relied very heavily not only on the UN charter, but on the traditional principles - sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference etc - of the Western society of states. Moreover since 1963 they have continued to cling tenaciously to these principles, particularly to the principle of territorial integrity.23 diplomatic thought. 'An international society presupposes an international system, but an international system may exist that is not an international society. Two or more states, in other words, may be in contact with each other and interact in such a way as to be necessary factors in each other's calculations without them being conscious of common interests or values, conceiving themselves to be bound by a common set of rules or cooperating in the working of common institutions.' The Anarchical Society , London, 1977, pp. 13-14. 22 1 have discussed the theoretical implications of this development inM. D. Donelan (ed.), Reason of States , London, 1977, Chapter 7, 'International Theory and Inter- national Society'. 22 The practical significance of the OAU commitment to those principles should not be discounted. It clearly weighed with the United States, for example, when they refused to supply arms to Somalia for use against Ethiopia. See, James Mayall, The Battle for the Horn: Somali Irridentism and International Diplomacy', World Today , September 1978, pp. 336-45.</page><page sequence="14">362 GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION But a commitment to the principles of international society inevitably carries with it the problem of accommodating principle to contingency. The chronic weaknesses of African states perhaps have led them to make even greater concessions to what they do not like but cannot avoid - Zambia's inability to disengage from dependence on South African capital even after nationalizing the copper industry for example - than govern- ments in general are customarily apt to make. But until two major but contingent events challenged the African diplomatic order, their political autonomy was not fundamentally at risk, in the sense - to cite the most glaring example - that with the imposition of an IMF adviser on the Zairean Central Bank it now may be. The first of these events was the sudden increase in the price of oil which dramatically exposed not merely the problem of continuing structural dependence upon the Western economy but, as a result of their now chronic payments prob- lems, the vulnerability of all but the lucky few oil producers to direct political pressure from the new as well as the old rich. The second was the Portuguese transfer of power to African regimes, to whom the OAU was in principle committed, but whose previous political education was radically different from that of most other African governments. Each of these events had an important consequence for Africa's involvement in international society. The first was to undermine the African commitment to the principles of egali- tarianism and non-alignment. Within the wider society of states there has always been a tension between the egalitarian order of law and the hierarchy of power, a tension which revealed itself for example in the nineteenth century when the Great Powers alone concerted 'to manage' the balance of power, and which was imposed upon the international community after 1945 when the five victorious allies insisted on a privileged status in the Security Council. But in Africa, the idea of hier- archy was resented and a deliberate attempt was made to bring the sovereign equality of states into line with diplomatic practice. But the powerful are not so easily harnessed. Equality as a diplomatic principle is best preserved when states have few demands to make of one another. Since 1973 the political leverage of the oil-producing states has begun to colour the</page><page sequence="15">AFRICA IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM 363 political and diplomatic map - Libya's sphere of influence in the north and north east is one example,24 Nigeria's weight on the west coast and its northern borders another. The result of this exposure to 'reality' is to create an informal pattern of intra-African power relations which is indirectly linked to external rivalries. In 1977, for example, when the Western powers were anxious to secure its support in their Southern African diplomacy, Nigeria challenged Niger, whose turn under the OAU rota system it then was, for one of the non-permanent places on the Security Council; while Libya, along with the Soviet Union, withdrew its support for the Eritrean separatists following the Ethiopian revolution. The transfer of power in the former Portuguese colonies compounded this effect by undermining the 'ideological cease- fire' on which the OAU settlement had been built. It is worth recalling that the early years of independence were marked by internecine feuding over the meaning and political implications of the common African commitment to unity. The disadvantage of this kind of conflict, namely that it exposes vulnerable regimes to subversion, impressed itself on African leaders very rapidly. They established an organization which attempted not only to impose a legal prohibition on subversion and political assassination25 but which effectively emptied Pan-Africanism of any content. It became illegitimate to make a state's ideology, or its external economic ties, a criterion for judging its eligi- bility to belong to the African community of states. It was sufficient that they were African, i.e. located on the African continent. The independence of Mozambique and Angola revived this latent ideological debate between African governments. By the time the emergency meeting of the OAU Council of Ministers met in Lagos in April 1977 to concert an African position on the Angolan crisis, the organization was split down the middle. 'Progressive' and 'moderate' regimes openly caucused along ideological lines which were directly linked to external rivalries 24 In October 1973 Colonel Gaddafi claimed that 'Libya in two years has succeeded in isolating Israel from Africa; seventeen countries of the dark continent have broken relations with the Jewish state thanks to our efforts.

In other words the fracture in the African com- munity was widened by the long-standing differences amongst the major powers over their own commitments to international society. Within most traditional accounts, the cooperative institutions of international society are both augmented and underpinned by the principle of the balance of power. In a world of com- peting sovereigns, as Martin Wight once put it, 'the alternative to the balance of power is not the community of power. . . it is a chimera. . . The only principle of order is to try to maintain, at the price of perpetual vigilance, an even distribution of power. The alternatives are either universal anarchy or universal dominion'.26 It was precisely this line of reasoning that the independent African leaders, like their Asian predecessors, had repudiated, although that did not mean that they were un- affected by it. The difficult problem in relation to Africa is to decide the extent to which it continues to govern the percep- tions of the Great Powers and more particularly (since it essentially forms part of the Western rather than the Soviet view) of successive American governments about the underlying mechanism of world order. Until very recently Africa was the one part of the world which was not directly linked to the central balance, while both the complexities and the brutal simplicity of racial conflict in Southern Africa gave the Western powers every reason to avoid forging such a link. On the first count it is hardly in dispute that in the ten years after 1963, when the O AU was established, the interests of the two super powers were not seriously in conflict in Africa. When the organization was formed, only eight months after the Cuban missile crisis, both the American and Soviet govern- ments welcomed with almost audible relief its commitment to the peaceful and (more significantly) to the African resolution of disputes. In the conflicts which erupted in the autumn of 1963, first in the Western Sahara and then in the Horn, the evidence suggests that both powers put their weight behind OAU mediation and restrained Morocco and Somalia, the two dissat- isfied states, in their efforts to gain wider diplomatic support.27 26 Martin Wight, The Balance of Power*, in Martin Wight and Herbert Butterfield, Diplomatic Investigations, London, 1966, pp. 174-5. 57 See D.C.Watt, Survey of International Affairs , 1963, Oxford University Press, 1977, Chapter 10, and Catherine Hoskyns (ed.), Case Studies in A frican Diplomacy , Number II, The Ethiopia-Somali-Kenya Dispute, 1960-67*, OUP for the Institute of Public Administration, Dar-es-Salaam, 1969.</page><page sequence="17">AFRICA IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM 365 This neutralizing of Africa in terms of the central balance was not, as has sometimes been argued, merely the result of a change to a more conservative, less activist regime, in the United States.28 By the mid-1960s both super powers had already scaled down their level of economic assistance to African governments. Until the events of 1973-4 forced the conflicts of Southern Africa on to the international agenda the political as well as the territorial status quo in Africa was supported by the relative lack of major super power interests in the continent. Very likely there was also a tacit acknowledgment by both powers of the dangers involved in their seeking such interests. Throughout the 1960s the implications of the Southern African conflict for the central balance were masked because the West was never forced to make a choice: its refusal to meet Afro-Asian demands for positive action against South Africa were compensated for by largely symbolic concessions. These ranged from the public condemnation of apartheid, through the American and British decisions to embargo arms sales on tne ground that the South African situation had 'disturbed inter- national peace and security' - a form of wording which deliber- ately fell short of that required to justify action under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter,29 to the Security Council meeting in July 1972 which was held in Addis Ababa rather than New York presumably because the purpose was merely to mobilise public opinion. In the long run these concessions will most probably be seen to have been of greater significance than the Western govern- ments perceived at the time. I shall return to this point shortly. Here it is sufficient to note how little Afro-Asian pressure 28 Raymond Aron has noted, when contrasting American policy in the Congo and the Nigerian Civil War, that the decline in globalism preceded Nixon's election, was logically consistent in the sense that there had never been a Soviet or Free World bloc in Asia, Africa or Latin America as there had been in Europe, and was merely accelerated by the Vietnam tragedy.

Mongi Slim, the Tunisian Foreign Minister, who represented the OAU on this occasion, concluded wrongly that it would lead to more decisive action.

The Americans were never willing to act decisively against their Portuguese allies on whose goodwill they depended for the continued lease of the Azores base.30 In Rhodesia the struggle following UDI failed to arouse any great American interest. To be sure the Americans supported both British pre- tensions of constitutional responsibility and British efforts to end the rebellion, but neither African opinion nor UN sanctions nor fears of providing an opening for the Soviet Union, deterred Congress in 1971 from passing Senator Byrd's amendment removing Rhodesian chrome from the sanctions list.31 Indeed, Western governments generally were so little worried about any long-term Communist threat to their own position in Southern Africa that they repeatedly turned down requests to build a railway linking the Zambian copper belt and Dar-es-Salaam, even when they knew the Chinese were anxious to take on the project. Perhaps they already foresaw that Peking was unlikely to exercise a decisive influence on events in Southern Africa. But when one recalls President Kennedy's determination to back the Volta River project rather than risk a repeat of the Aswan Dam disaster,32 another explanation seems more plausible, namely that Africa was now considered an area of only marginal strategic concern in the relations of the United States with its major rival. At the same time the evidence suggests that while the Ameri- cans did not anticipate a serious external challenge to their Southern African interests, the Nixon administration was concerned about the impact of racial conflict on these interests. They seem to have drawn the conclusion that since 'the whites are here to stay', the best policy was to cooperate with them, actively encouraging trade, investment and scientific and tech- 30 The Americans had cause to use this base as late as 1973 when their European allies refused to allow their territory to be used for shipping military supplies to Israel. 31 See, Robert C.

The events of 1973-75 undermined the assumptions on which this policy was based. Any full analysis of the dramatic change in the central balance over these years would have to go far beyond the scope of this essay. It would have to take account in particular of the consequences of the formal insti- tutionalization of the post-war settlement in Europe, the American withdrawal from Indo-China, the Soviet Union's expulsion from Egypt and the protracted crisis in the inter- national economy. But the conjunction of these events had one consequence which had a direct bearing on Africa, namely that between the two super powers the balance of restraint had shifted: the United States was now heavily constrained from assuming new commitments, both domestically and under the terms of the Nixon doctrine, while the Soviet Union was released from many of the inhibitions which had traditionally framed its foreign policy in the Third World. In Angola, the US administration confronted the dilemma which its successor has still to resolve: whether to react to African crises in terms of the US/Soviet relationship or on the basis of an analysis of the specifically African context. Dr Kissinger's commitment to balance of power diplomacy « The evidence for this view is provided by the National Security Council Memo- randum which Dr Kissinger had prepared in 1969 for the incoming administration.

The first was what to do in circumstances where there was no undisputed authority with whom to deal; the second, what to do in a situation where supporting the local balance of power (if it could be said to exist at all) involved at least tacitly supporting South Africa, with the attendant risk of alienating African opinion to a point where even those regimes which were initially hostile to Soviet intervention would feel compelled to change their allegiance. His attempt to overcome these problems in Angola by covert means was seriously misjudged and was abandoned when Congress refused to vote the necessary funds.37 Kissinger attempted to repair the damage, insisting in public testimony that the 'United States must make it clear that Angola sets no precedent; this type of action will not be toler- ated elsewhere'; but once both overt and covert operations had been ruled out, it was not at all clear what alternative means were available for influencing the course of events in Southern Africa. His belated attempts to achieve a Rhodesian settlement lent more credibility to British mediation but achieved nothing beyond the abortive Geneva conference in 1976. Over two years later, the British abandonment of their proposal for an all-party conference following the Hughes mission - a decision which was agreed with Washington - virtually admits that the Western powers are now without a policy at all. THE WESTERN DILEMMA IN SOUTHERN AFRICA The argument brings us back finally, therefore, to the relation- ship between the arrangements of international society and the 3« See Kissinger's statement before the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 29 January 1976.

It is true, as one American participant in the Angolan decision has put it, that 'none of the major actors entered the drama of 1975 unencumbered by the baggage of the past'. But some of the baggage is peculiarly inhibiting for the West. Although, as I have already suggested, the OAU Charter was in most respects in conformity with the prevailing norms of international society, in one vital respect it arguably went beyond them, namely in binding its members to oppose with all means at their disposal the remaining out- posts of colonialism and racism on the African continent. But only arguably. The African states have adopted as part of their public ideology (what individual leaders actually believe is, in this context, neither here nor there) a frankly historicist conception of time in which human affairs are moving inevitably, and therefore rightly, towards the goal of national and racial liberation. No matter that from any perspective such a goal is ambiguous in its entailments, it remains the only respectable goal for any African leader to adopt. In this respect Ali Mazrui is quite right when he argues that the Soviet Union (a power with its own official view of the linear workings of history) has been at least a decade ahead of the West in perceiving the need to support Africa's legitimate aspirations.38 But the Western powers themselves are also committed to the possibility of human improvement if not to the idea of linear progress. The attempt, partial and intellectually insecure as it may be, to move from the position where only states are acknowledged as international persons to one where individuals also have this status (as for example under the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights) is as the Africans correctly perceive seriously compromised by continued Western support for South Africa. It may be legitimately argued, in other words, that the West has embarked upon a process of legal and political innovation which itself challenges and extends the traditional conception of international order. It is not easy to see how the Western powers, having boxed themselves into this corner, can extricate themselves. Nor is it a simple matter to say what they should do. It takes a peculiar kind of moral innocence, and an exaggerated conception of human freedom, to believe that South African whites can be brought to surrender power either through conversion or under 3« Ali Mazrui, Africa's International Relations , Heinemann/Westview Press, Boulder, Colorado, 1978, p. 180.</page><page sequence="22">370 GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION the impact of economic sanctions. There are also genuine intellectual as well as practical difficulties. Within the Western tradition, the commitment to the possibility of progress (how- ever defined) has never carried the implication that the end can justify the means. The Western powers have never been prepared, for example, to endorse Krishna Menon's description of colon- ialism as a form of permanent aggression, a formula which has been adopted by Third World countries to establish the inter- national legitimacy of wars of national liberation. The reasoned ground for this refusal (as distinct from those of interest) is that, as a principle in international society, it cannot be uni- versalized, that is held to apply not only to Western colonialism but, for example, to the Soviet Union in Central Asia or, for that matter, to Somali occupied territory within the Ethiopian empire. One consequence of this constraint is that while the West has broadly endorsed the Southern African objectives of the OAU, they have never extended this support to the military activities of the ALC or the liberation movements, thus leaving the field open to the Communist powers. The fact that the debate over Western policy on Southern Africa is once again revolving - albeit rather wearily - around the feasibility of applying sanctions against the Republic, illustrates what is perhaps the most intractable aspect of the Western dilemma, the difficulty of selling to those parts of the world which were colonialised by the European powers, a conception of international order, the normative principles of which are overwhelmingly negative. The history of Western thought about international relations is largely about restraint on the use (and abuse) of power. The idea ofeconomic sanctions as a kind of functional equivalent to war was fitted rather uneasily into this structure during the 'idealist' aftermath of the 1914-18 war. But as an instrument of multilateral collective pressure it has never worked.39 The governments of the Western powers know this; and they also know in consequence that they do not have available a doctrine of positive intervention for use against tyrannical regimes. Over South Africa perhaps they can for the moment fall back on hypocrisy, that is continue, with- out confidence, to encourage Pretoria to engage in peaceful change and acknowledge internationally the legitimacy of black 39 See for example, Maragaret Doxey, Economic Sanctions and International Enforcement , Oxford University Press, 1971.</page><page sequence="23">AFRICA IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM 371 African aspirations, while conducting their relations with the Republic on as near a business-as-usual basis as possible. If so, they will be acting no doubt upon the plausible assumption that the Soviet Union is unlikely to want to take on South Africa itself, and that the system of what Dennis Austin has called 'cohesion without consensus', which supports white power, will indeed continue into the foreseeable future.40 If these last two assumptions prove false, then a truly inter- national crisis will at last have arisen in Southern Africa which will be both dangerous and unpredictable. But there is another danger quite separate from such actuarial calculations. Hypocrisy, it has been said, is the price that vice pays to virtue. In any conceivable international order it seems inherently unlikely that all the vicious elements of human affairs will have been eradi- cated; in international relations, a realm which on one view is governed by expediency and power to the virtual exclusion of principle, there is a strong case for hypocrisy. But any set of principles must be permanently devalued if it is shown to consist of nothing but good intentions. It may be objected that there are many worse tyrannies than South Africa, against which the Western powers are not expected to act. That is true, but also irrelevant. For South Africa is the one Western state, which openly denies the intellectual basis of Western social and political thought, and hence of the Western conception of international order. At its most rudimentary (and it is because it can be expressed in this way that it can and has been successfully exported) this conception involves the proposition that contract not status should determine rights and obligations at all levels of society. It is of course a shamelessly rationalist conception, wide open to the charge that it breeds anomy and provides no room for group or national loyalties. This is also fair comment, and one reason perhaps why we should extend sympathetic under- standing for those locked into the appalling structure of loyalties that constitutes Afrikanerdom. There, but for the luck of being born somewhere else, go most if not all of us. But the fact that Western societies are notoriously short on national cohesion cannot lead them to support South Africa's claims to inter- national legitimacy. If it does, they will be sabotaging any hope 40 Dennis Austin, łWhite Power in South Africa: Cohesion without Consensus?*, Government and Opposition , Vol. 13, No. 1, Winter 1978.</page><page sequence="24">372 GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION of a reasonable diplomatie system, that is one based on prin- ciples to which, whatever their conflicts, men everywhere can agree. 'It is one thing to try, to fail and to try again', President Nyerere is reported to have said, 'It is an entirely different matter to base the whole structure of your society on the denial of human rights. With a society of that kind we compromise at our peril. For ultimately humanity is not to be denied'. I am not sure about compromising, for diplomacy of any kind is impossible without compromise, as indeed Nyerere has dis- covered for himself in Southern Africa. I am also less sanguine than he about humanity rising, phoenix-like, from the ashes. But his first point surely goes to the heart of the matter. To the Western powers, therefore, South Africa remains a doubly crippling problem. Their inaction undermines African and Third World support for the Western conception of international order; and in the distorted mirror of South African society they may see their own reflection and conclude that the com- mitment to a political and moral philosophy which insists that men should be judged as such and not according to any social or hierarchical criteria is altogether too austere to form the basis of an international policy.</page></plain_text>
