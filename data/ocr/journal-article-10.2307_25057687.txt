<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PRECARIOUS TURNING: TENNYSON'S REDEMPTION OF LITERATURE AND LIFE FROM MEDIEVALISM By William E. Buckler Tennyson is not only breaking out ofthe pedestrian clich?s andfro zen critical expectations that for so long enshrouded him; he is grad ually but steadily emerging as a poet of arbitration, as one ofthe poet practitioners by whose work the nature of poetry must itself be defined and against which the work of poets habitually preferred to him will more and more be measured. The subject thus introduced - the steady emergence of Tennyson, after an extended period of critical and creative resistance, as the great est poet in the long rhythms ofthe modernist tradition and one ofthe two or three English poets other than Shakespeare who can rightly claim a place in the most select hierarchy of Indo-European poets - far exceeds my specific topic of Tennysonian medievalism, but it is not alien to it. Medievalism- and the issue ofthe historical imagination im plicit in the general rubric of "Victorian Medievalism "-provides afit ting way of seeing how Tennyson saw matters very common in his day differently from the way in which his contemporaries saw them and how his persistent, imaginative individuality created something far greater than his irresistible invasion ofthe language and rhythms of po etry to which every poet from Arnold to Yeats could attest. Tennyson simply changed the expectations, obligations, and resources ofthe po etic imagination.1 Quietly, distinctively, and massively-with a verbal pressure here, a structural model there, a nuance of consciousness, a redemption of both meter and genre, a subordination of thought to the experience of thought, the creation o?* persona undergoing the jeop ardy of process, the redirection of a habitual narrative expectation, the 85</page><page sequence="2">86 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES release of a precarious imaginative poise in which a seemingly endless variety of images bombard each other in a state of explosive simulta neity - Tennyson altered the atmosphere in which poetry subsists. He was deeply, reflectively, creatively attentive to both the accretions and the organic movements of English poetry as a whole as well as in its lat est Romantic manifestations, and he absorbed it all into that transfor mational process to which he knew it was all relevant. But he also drew freshly and at a new level of integration upon the whole Indo-European literary past, and it is at this quintessentially literary level that the cli ch? about Tennyson's provincialism of subject-matter needs to be to tally reexamined. In his attention to the subjects ( as distinct from the subject ma tter) of poetry, Tennyson was as fundamentalist as the poetic tradition itself. He was never an easy adopter: he was not an imitator, but an absorber and a transformer, always leaving an idea or a poetic form distinctively altered from what he found it by how he touched it. He had manifested a measurable degree of availability to the pervasive expressiveness which the Romantic poets had brought to nineteenth-century literary experience. He was Wordsworthian at a profound level of his imag inative consciousness, though he did not adopt in any singular way Wordsworth's psychology of poetic creation, his theory of mind, his poetic idiom, or his poetic structures; and Tennyson's poetic canon both lightly continues and thoroughly critiques Keats. But he was en tirely attuned to those correctives to Romanticism which were inher ent in a literary tradition as old as Homer and Aristotle and as contem porary as Matthew Arnold: "All depends upon the subject; choose a fitting action, penetrate yourself with the feeling of its situations; this done, everything else will follow. "2 An authentically poetical action {a literary subject), a full assimilation of the action into a wholly appro priate poetic form (literary decorum), and meticulous constructional craftsmanship (literary conscientiousness) - these were as basic to Tennyson's practice as they were to Aristotle's and Arnold's theory, and it was at this fundamental literary level that Tennyson's creative individuality worked. Everything else was essentially accidental, sub ordinate, organically derivative but not poetically primary; the "per fect keeping" of which Coleridge and Hallam spoke must function there, and if that was intact, a thousand superficial infelicities could not damage the classical greatness of the basic poetic work.</page><page sequence="3">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 87 As it turns out, Tennyson was one ofthe world's poets least prone to infelicities : he was a master of language and prosody in all their variant uses and relationships, and, as criticism is only now discovering on a large scale, he understood the place of narrative in poetry with a sub tlety and a diversity that few poets have ever surpassed. But while these marvelous qualities add immeasurably to our pleasure in Ten nyson, they do not themselves define his degree of greatness : they are aspects ofthe signature of time and personality on his poetry rather than revelations of that elemental intuition of man in his universe which, translated into subject, genre, and construction, is the ultimate basis of his stature as a poet. They are analogous to those changes in the superficies of style which a different poet or a different era inevi tably brings to the idiomatic physiognomy of poetry; and although they often serve as verbal avenues of access to the inner structures of the poet's imaginative consciousness, to the primary metaphors of an all-encompassing apprehension, they sometimes do not, diverting us rather to germane but somewhat tangential attendance on the thought of a poem or its feeling and leaving us with a greater sense of a poem's force than of its ultimate imaginative significance. This is why a con sideration of Tennyson's literariness in its most fundamental sense - in its classical, non-rhetorical sense, so to speak - is so indispensable to a just perception of his place in poetry; this is why his immersion in, transformation of, and meticulous attention to the imaginative work ing of genres is so crucial to a consideration of how his poetry makes its disclosures and gradually - poem by poem, decade by decade - takes on so monumental a poetic character and presence; and this is why Tennyson's perpetual refusion of literature and life - his contin uous reflective consciousness that if life is to be made worthwhile through examination, then a criticism of life necessarily involves a si multaneous criticism of art - makes it verifiably meaningful in some thing more than a graceful metaphoric sense to say of his poetic canon that it aspires to be both a universal reading act and a universal writ ing act. Even to attempt to point the reader's attention in these general directions through a consideration of Tennyson's use of medieval materials in a necessarily short paper, one has to take some very pre carious methodological chances, foregoing the pleasurable luxury of a slow, text-centered gradualism and realizing, with Aeschylus and</page><page sequence="4">88 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES Thomas Hardy, that the argument "would be unintelligible without supplementary scenes of the imagination" to be supplied by a reader willing and able to make them.3 Perhaps one way of gaining initial perspective on the central issue is to consider some of the ramifications of that far-reaching surge of creativity which Tennyson released in the few months immediately following word of Arthur Hallam's death, the closing months of 1833 in which, at the age of twenty-four, Tennyson shaped the broad out lines of his whole poetic career. Among the twenty or so poems that, at least in their initial form, can be definitely or tentatively assigned to this brief period,4 the most definite are the most important, and they form some interesting patterns: three are classical ("Ulysses," "Ti thonus," and "Tiresias"), two are medieval ("St. Simeon Stylites" and "Morte d'Arthur"), and three are contemporary ("The Two Voices," canto lxxxv of In Memoriam, along with seven other can tos, and " Oh! that 'twere possible"). Central to all of them is the issue of death; no two of them see the issue in quite the same way; the issue is not more relevant to one than to another; and the different literary effect of each depends essentially upon the subject (an imaginary per sona centered in, penetrated by, a disclosing fiction), the poetic form (the structure of disclosure), and the constructional craftsmanship. All are in the confessional mode (including, in a different degree, "Morte d'Arthur"); each releases, through its emblematic character, an experiential field much larger than itself, moving backward and forward in time as if in search of a correspondingpersona in its corre sponding fiction; the oldest in the accidents of fictional time, "Ulys ses," is not more mythic than the newest, " Oh! that 'twere possible," the " story" of the former to one who has not read Homer's poem or Dante's being no more explicit than the story of the latter to one who has not read "Maud"; and it is just as easy to imagine the speaker in "Oh! that 'twere possible" playing back in time as it is to imagine Ulysses playing forward. Given such an imaginative context, one must speak of Tennyson's medievalism in very carefully honed terms. Tennyson had to believe about the Middle Ages what he believed about all ages, including his own - namely, that it was made up of a dense fabric of cultural meta phors among which unaccommodated man negotiated a life-curve ac cording to his various passions and capacities. He believed, too, that</page><page sequence="5">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 89 every man is a refraction of every other man and that every age mir rors every other age. To the degree that he was a Romantic, he was a severely corrected Romantic; and while he had no desire to indict the Middle Ages, he certainly did not want to lay unction to its self delusions or to encourage the tendency in his time to romanticize me dievalism in a self-debilitating way. Tennyson was drawn into the general renewal of interest in the Middle Ages characteristic of his time, and his interest, like that of Carlyle, Ruskin, Browning, and other persons of strong imagination, was fueled by the need to find literary ways of releasing contemporary man from the dead-centeredness, the wrong-headedness, the self blinding chauvinism of his own age. But when we get beyond the fact that Tennyson made considerble use of medieval subject matter, we must move with great critical caution because then we are approach ing an area in which critical language frequently softens, and, in an easy flow of rhetoric, poetry is thrown away on history. We hear and are perhaps tempted to use such terms as "the medieval imagina tion," as if a poet in the modernist tradition could be possessed of such a quality; or "the historical imagination," as if it were not a con tradition in terms; or we may say quite seriously that Tennyson's imagination was not "at home" in the Middle Ages because we may think that, having chosen a poetical action or subject with that locus in historical time, the poet has incurred a peculiarly historical responsi bility and must move with a historian's ease and authority among the dense fabric of cultural metaphors, the illusion of literalness, which characterizes the age. But in doing so, we run the very real risk of be coming rhetoricians rather than critics and of depleting the peculiar integrity of poetry by allowing it to become a species of versified his tory for which the formalist techniques on which literary criticism has always at bottom depended become essentially inoperative. No se rious student of Tennyson's poetry would allow terms like "the pic turesque" or "the grotesque" to lose their severe aesthetic signifi cance; but the much more crucial term "poetic imagination" is used so loosely even by learned Tennysonians that great poetry loses much of its dinstinctiveness and imagination nearly all of its meaning. Even if one does not recur, say, to Aristotle or to Coleridge for spe cific methodological guidance, he cannot conscientiously ignore the fact that, if he would practice criticism, he must do something roughly</page><page sequence="6">90 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES analogous to what they and others have done. He may, like Arnold, shy away from scientific criticism and from philosophical criticism; but, also like Arnold, he must develop a serious, purposive critical method without inventing his critical hypotheses: "Hypotheses non fingo," borrowed from Isaac Newton, is a "cardinal principle" of Arnold's literary criticism.5 If, then, we look at a representative cluster of Tennyson's shorter poems that employ medieval subject matter - a character with a me dieval history, a legend with medieval currency, some combination of the two - we can expect to find either that Matthew Arnold was quite wrong when he said that "The date of an action... signifies nothing" or that the medievalism ofthe poems bears no indispensable relation ship to the subject, form, and craftsmanship by which the poet dis closes his basic imaginative intuition. And Arnold's critical precepts, on both the positive and the negative sides, seem to be fundamentally sustained by the example of" St. Simeon Stylites" and "The Voyage of Maeldune," two Tennyson poems which are major short pieces fully saturated, as it were, with medievalism. "St. Simeon Stylites" is essentially a symbolist poem cast in the form of amonodrama. Its subject is apersona at the culminating point of his life-curve who performs, through the poet's generosity, a final arabesque for us as privileged voyeurs and eavesdroppers, and out of this a total action emerges, drawing us into a central imaginative awareness - the terrible grotesque at the heart of much human en thusiasm - by which we are released from the particularities of the poem's subject matter and enabled to rise with a sensibility more keenly attuned to what we now see as a very substantial coordinate in general human gesturing. History has been used to free us of history and to prepare us better to deal with time. That Simeon was a famous pillar-hermit at the beginning of the fourth century whose path the founder of Western monasticism, St. Anthony the Great, crossed fills us with many thoughtful possibilities, and our sense ofthe motion of historical metaphor may make us think of Pater's seeding, in Marius the Epicurean, of medieval ascetic monasticism in the character of Marcus Aurelius and ofthe debonair grace of St. Francis of Assisi in Marius himself; and of course we take all the riches we can find where we find them, though it would be grossly reductive to interpret the poem as in any primary way a statement about the horrifying charac</page><page sequence="7">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 91 ter of an incipient Christian asceticism, rather than a densely textured dramatic representation of a strange soul tortured at a grimly ma cabre and grotesquely humorous level by the anguished anxiety and extravagant emotional swings to which a violent competition in dehu manization has led him. We must exercise our critical judgment in separating the precious from the semi-precious and the simulated, and the architecture of the poem itself, the constructional craftsman ship of its total action (beginning, middle, end), directs our imagina tive eye to its own imaginative center and engenders a metaphor of imaginative integrity that is so thoroughly aesthetic that the human life criticized by the poem criticizes the poem too. Nothing Simeon the pillar-hermit does has a relevance independent of the poetic pro cedure itself, and our fascination with him as an individual personal ity works, through our critical resistance to the literalness to which that fascination would finally lead, to deepen our perceptual connec tion with the central subject, just as our resistance to the blandish ments of a literal historical reading intensifies our response to its true metaphoric or mythic character as imaginative experience. As a po etic procedure in its most fundamental sense (subject or action, poetic form, architecture), " St. Simeon Stylites" has rather full-bodied ana logues in "Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind" and "Oh! that 'twere possible," despite their very different fictions, and it picks up lights from "Tithonus," "Tiresias," and "Ulysses." The recognition that this is so draws the poem's central imaginative awareness into a perceptual ambience that is perennial rather than peculiarly medieval. Tennyson did not need to reject the medieval metaphors that clustered round the action centered in St. Simeon, just as he did not reject the modern metaphors that gave a density of fabric to "Locksley Hall,"/? Memoriam, andMaud; but in all cases it was not the historical or the medieval or the contemporary imagination at work; it was the poetic imagination employing the materials at hand toward a severely distinctive poetic end. The action at the imaginative center of "The Voyage of Maeldune" turns on the chastening of the moral imagination through symbolical experience of the world beyond one's ordinary habits, that getting of yourself out of yourself and something else into you that Samuel But ler called "crossing." It moves Homeric severity toward Celtic dila tion, the simplicity of the Odyssey, with a literary nod toward Byron,</page><page sequence="8">92 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES in the direction of an equivalent, in the "Celtic genius," of what Ar nold had called "its turn for style, its turn for melancholy, and its turn for natural magic."6 Therefore, the "crossing" at the center ofthe ac tion is also at the center of the poetic form of the fabulous voyage which it employs, and even the emblematic narrative of the Greek classicism of Homer is drawn toward the allegorical tradition ofthe Middle Ages, though its Homeric counter-narrative holds Tenny son's poem in a symbolical rather than a fully allegorical poise. Here, then, style itself is absorbed into the very concept of action, and the stylistic distinctiveness ness ofthe poem is a dimension ofthe generic persona who narrates it: how "they" see things, how sensuously tac tile but evanescent experience is to personalities both volatile and nostalgic, morally fixated and imaginatively redemptive, suffuses the very texture of language and incident. "The Voyage of Maeldune" is a very special example of literature made of literature. Tennyson fol lowed P. W. Joyce's Old Celtic Romances, while adding details, elaborations, and structural-experiential antitheses,7 about a race of people at the center of whose imaginations are both the folk hero and the holy man and whose principal delights - epical romantic songs and imaginary voyages into magical experiences - are often tragic ally marred by spasm of Titanic violence and a pervasive world weariness and melancholy.8 "The Voyage of Maeldune" is thus an imaginative voyage into the imagination itself of one of the world's pervasive races - man in his specialized representativeness - cen tered in an action, poetic form, and architecture of which their own imaginary history supplies the primary analogues. Its Celticism reaches metaphorically toward a larger metaphor in ethnology, and its medievalism reaches into both a pre-medieval past and a post modern future, again using history as an imaginative device for tran scending history. These thoughts may make it possible to talk meaningfully about a poem that perpetually rejects even encyclopedic efforts to study its anatomy while staying in touch with its life-force. So little has been said of so much that needs to be said about Idylls ofthe King that the critic is constantly forced back upon the elaboration of essentially el ementary concepts and perceptions by the realization that even mat ters which seem luminously self-evident cannot be assumed to have currency even among Tennysonians. This situation is partly the re sult, of course, ofthe masterful imaginative evasiveness into which</page><page sequence="9">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 93 Tennyson cast the poem - that riddle of the painful earth which defies comprehensive knowledge and yields coherence only to imaginative faith, about which bards themselves can only riddle, and for which the terminus of a study (death) only signals the beginning of a new study (birth). A poet who would dare create an " image of the mighty world" would recognize above all others that no order of thought about it could ever become frozen and conclusive and that the renewal im plicit in the prospective myth of Arthur is our only real hope; like Guinevere's, ours is a fallen condition, and even after much failure and much privileged experience, the best we can hope for is to recog nize that "the highest" is the "most human too." But the grand imag ination of the master poet must not be allowed to cover over the fail ures of the critic. Even the best critics have failed to recognize the true poetic stature of Tennyson- that he is like Milton, Dante, Virgil, and Homer and must be dealt with as Milton, Dante, Virgil, and Homer have been dealt with; they have labored within a suspicion of, rather than a fully clarified recognition of, Tennyson's greatness and have been not only cautious (which is a critical virtue) but timid (which is not). As Churton Collins pointed out almost a century ago, genuine recognition of Tennyson requires that his writings (like those of Mil ton, Dante, Virgil, and Homer) be "submitted to the ordeal of the mi nutest critical investigation."9 And although this paper flies violently in the face of Collins's prescription, with which I fully agree, it will try to establish a premise of two that may motivate critical minute ness. It has long been recognized that, though Idylls of the King sends out strong epic signals, it cannot be adequately or appropriately measured by the epic pattern found in Homer: though epic in scale, it works internally in a way different from the way the Iliad and the Odyssey work. This difference has been generally identified as a re sult of a fusion of the cyclic epic of Homer with the little epic or epyl lion of Theocritus, a fusion first effected by Virgil and renewed, each in his own fashioning, by Dante, Milton, Tennyson, Pound, Eliot, and others.10 The cyclic or solar epic, so conspicuous in Tennyson's Idylls, is still there, but it has been made to work through the self contained, relatively short narrative poems called epyllia. These had in turn fused with the Alexandrian idyllia - highly wrought "little pictures," "each holding its tiny convex mirror up to nature"11 - and this enables us to describe how, at the internal level of the individual</page><page sequence="10">94 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES "little epics," Tennyson's poem works. This is all very helpful and moves literary matters a good way forward, but it ends ultimately in our ignoring the most imaginative turning that Tennyson gave his central literary inheritance. That final turning, which is a largely un recognized characteristic of Tennyson and which makes his imagina tive credentials so worthy of acclaim, is the return, at the very deep est, the quintessential, level, of this post-Theocritan, post-Virgilian literary development to primary coherence with Homer. He makes full use ofthe religious ritual and magic to which the little epic was " a deliberate return,"12 but he makes it coordinate with the "rational and limited social function" of Homer. The magical deep-rootedness which we witness in Elaine, who is the fairy temptress of Lancelot, is in fact resisted by Arthur's greatest knight, and it helps him define and finally heal his torn humanness and rise to a moral conquest that is es sentially rational and social. Tristram's dilemma, superficial com pared to Lancelot's as an authentic dilemma, reflects the autumnal afterglow of Arthurianism in which a victim of magic attempts to give rational justification to his irredeemable state while he plays it out to its horrifying "magical" conclusion. And though Merlin the magi cian succumbs as inevitably to Viven as, in its fabliau analogue, Jan uary succumbs to the blandishments of May, Guinevere rises in bleak December to a severe rational and social enlightenment that sets aside the magic of her fantasy life and accepts a grand but chastened humanness worthy of Homeric humanity. Thus, although at its epyl lion level Idylls ofthe King seems to be "the tale ofthe tribe" as dis tinct from the narrative of individual spiritual conquest exemplified by Homeric epic, at its quintessential level, it is the story of" a man" - of every man - and its ultimate image of conscientious man is that of Bedivere standing high and alone, under his " arch of hand" straining his eyes to see and, because he stares into the sunrise, not being sure that what he sees are not simply his own eye specks. This is an image eminently Homeric, perennially Odyssean, and Tennyson's myth of the return at the subtlest literary level is played out as a return to Ho mer, So whatever rich use one may make of a post-Theocritan, post Virgilian Tennyson - complex and literarilypsychological - the final imaginative turning is back toward Homer. Further, the individual idylls are not simply idyllian epyllia. The whole poem moves along a strange literary diagonal in which many of</page><page sequence="11">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 95 the chief structures of Western literature are implanted so that, even though the epyllion is in place, it is played against or counterpointed to an alternative literary structure that may in fact be primary. A quick, rather raw catalogue will perhaps illustrate this additional literary dimension of the poem most economically. "The Coming of Arthur" is a prolegomenon, a frame-tale as to function and a roman tic or chivalric epic as to formal literary character. " Gareth and Lyn ette" is a courtly romance, a rite de passage, in which all the obverse of the courtly and the romantic is suspended in comedie tone, wholly seeded and in full expectation of reversal. "The Marriage of Geraint" is a parody or burlesque of the courtly romance in which the rituals have become mechanical, fantastical, misguided, tasteless, and om inous. " Geraint and Enid" is a myth-poem, its analogue being a cruel Cupid and a long-suffering Psyche. It is an inverted epic, formalistic ally, an Odyssey in the wilderness of bluntness and stupidity and suf focating literalness. Its epic resonances are shrunken to the genuine harrowings of domestic parable. "Balin and Balan" is a Doppel g?nger tale of the sundered imagination, the Geraint-theme of "man against himself moved into an ambience of violence and seemingly unavoidable collision. Tragedy is the emergent rubric, but the tragic grotesque is the aesthetic category, touching the terror of the Gothic sublime. " Merlin and Vivien" is an Ur-tale, a naturalistic tale of fairy fairy changelings, primitive in its origins, terrifying in its implications. Again tragedy is the rubric, but it is so ontologically displaced that our sense is one of prurient fascination rather than of authentically cathartic pity and fear. Lancelot and Elaine also has an Ur-tale qual ity, and this dyes one coordinate of its courtly love character. An other is its excruciating quality of pathos, by which our capacity to hold onto the stabilizing austerities of the tragic vision - that is, our ultimate faith in humanness - is most strenuously tested: we, like Lancelot, are measured, and like Lancelot we survive at a perilous edge. Tragedy and pathos are so weighted and intertwined that we, too, must break the bonds that threaten to defame both literature and life. "The Holy Grail" is a quest-poem having analogues in both the epic and the wholly collapsed courtliness of romance. It is a tale of terrifyingly alluring deception, the deception of the sentimentalized spiritual imagination; and we are saved from our temptations by the chillingly ironic narrative manner with which the tale is told. It is a</page><page sequence="12">96 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES fundamentally literary experience for which we have to be eminently grateful, chastened but purged at the subtlest and least comfortable level of our wholly human miracle-mongering. "Pelleas and Ettarre" is a courtly romance wholly brutalized. There is a primitivism to it too, but a primitivism that reaches, not to the dark grots ofthe Ur-tale, but to the classical groves of Pan. It has a literary analogue in Don Quixote, but it mercilessly fractures Don Quixote's idealism and vio lently tramples the excruciating pathos of "Lancelot and Elaine" by reaching for a brief moment an authentic tragic poise and then blow ing Tragedy itself to smithereens. "The Last Tournament" is a hor rible revenge tragedy on the Roman/Jacobean model, in which the brute violences of a world gone mad with rebellion against commun ity makes near-irredeemable pain lord in the heart of man. "Guin evere" is a classically tragic formulation, a literary recomposition of the literary world ofIdylls ofthe King. "The Passing of Arthur " is an end-tale, the omega of "The Coming"'s alpha, an epic of monumen tal loss at the spongey edges of civilization, with (maybe) just a bare saving remnant ofthe faith, hope, and love that keeps us, without tak ing violent revenge on ourselves and our universe, on a precarious course toward our own island valley of Avilion. Thus Idylls ofthe King is in a constant process of reconfigurating itself, emerging and reimmersing in new ways, just as its images con stantly cluster and dissolve. The poem as a whole, like the individual idylls, is a poem beyond itself, " a design in a web, the actual threads of which pass out beyond it."13 It is not only a rich literary experience, but an "image ofthe mighty world" of literary experience. A univer sal reading act because of the manner in which the poet gives every reader his own degree of access to the poem, according to his individ ual capacity and sympathy, it also aspires to be a universal writing act in that it varies, to the symbolic nth degree, the exemplary workings of the literary imagination (insights, structures, narrative manners) and creates access routes to the multiple literary traditions upon which it builds so deftly but unmistakably. And what does all this have to do with Tennysonian medievalism? A great deal, I think, and at a very crucial level, because nothing so conspicuous as the " age of Arthur" can be properly dealt with until one is willing to entertain the possibility at least that Tennyson is doing the wholly unexpected - that, for example, he is criticizing the</page><page sequence="13">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 97 very Virgilianism of which he has been thought to be an enervated latter-day continuator; that the melancholy that so misled Eliot and Auden is not the ultimate condition but the ultimate strategy of Tennyson's imagination; and that his view of poetry is being subtly but consciously counterpointed to that of the "Virgil of the Middle Ages," Dante. If this should prove to be so - and, once said, its plaus ibility dilates startingly - then it gives a wholly new character and co herence to that sudden rush of creativity which Tennyson underwent in the closing months of 1833 and to the fact that Tennyson took a lifetime, an age, to work out the imaginative implications seeded there; and it finally enables us to make full sense of Tennyson's as sertion that there is more of autobiography in "Ulysses" than in all of In Memoriam. The first thing that we need to notice is that Dante is an imaginative presence in all of the important poems seeded here: he is the direct source of "Ulysses"; Tennyson called/? Memoriam "a kind of Di vina Commedia"; Maud, especially in Part in, uses Beatrice as a clear if evasive analogue; and Idylls of the King, both structurally and apprehensively, plays Tennyson's tragedy against Dante's com edy, his before death against Dante's after death. But more crucial is the fact that Ulysses' speech to Virgil and Dante in Canto xxvi of the Inferno has prima facie relevance, not just to Tennyson's brief mono drama, but to all the other poems as well: "O brothers," said I, "who are come despite Ten thousand perils to the West, let none, While still our senses hold the vigil slight Remaining to us ere our course is run, Be willing to forgo experience Of the unpeopled world beyond the sun. Regard your origin, - from whom and whence! Not to exist like brutes, but made were ye To follow virtue and intelligence."14 For this "evil counsel," Dante condemned Ulysses; but Tennyson did not, and both the monodramatic model and the precarious but he roic humanness upon which Tennyson's poems turn may well have been extrapolated from this brief speech of Dante's Ulysses. Arthur and Ulysses share the "Ten thousand perils" that brought them "to the West," and Arthur along with Ulysses - that is, conscientious</page><page sequence="14">98 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES man in all ages - is being reinvested with a portion ofthat Homericism of which Virgil, Dante, and the Middle Ages had divested him; and what we have in Tennyson from 1833 to 1892, certainly from " Ulys ses" through Idylls ofthe King, is not the poet of Robson's "di lemma" or of McLuhan's "never able to make up his mind"15 - the two Tennysons of that uncorrected Romanticism of which modern critics have often written - but a poet who, having typed for himself the existential precariousness of man in this world, saw the need to correct while he employed two millenia ofthe very richest literary in inheritance and, in that sobering insight that also returns Milton to Homer, to "walk this world, Yoked in all exercise of noble end, And so through those dark gates across the wild That no man knows." (The Princess, vu, 339-42) Those "dark gates" are also the pillars of Hercules, and "the wild / That no man knows" is that "wandering western sea" that leads "be yond the sunset, and the baths / Of all the western stars..." ("Ulys ses," 11. 60-61). Thus again we arrive at the unavoidable conclusion that Tenny son's IdyIls is supremely literary, not at some Romantic level of spilt religion or strangeness wedded to beauty, but at a severely winnowed, truly tragic, classically monitored level. It is in fact an imaginative lit erary redemption of man from the imperious enticements ofthe meta phor of medievalism, at whose very center is the devastating quest for the Holy Grail; of which Galahad, whom the poet moves into a crit ically ironic imaginative medium, is, with his psychotic nun, the for lorn best hope; and of which a spiritually, morally, psychologically depleted Percivale is the ambiguous, unsavory barometric result. Medievalism is a metaphor of perceptual self-deception absorbed into the basic action ofthe poem; and once we get in touch with that basic action, medievalism loses centrality and becomes part of the imaginative Stoffen, the complex metaphoric materiel, ofthe poem. Arthur is a Ulysses retailored in the fabric of time, and his philosophy of work is Homeric. He loses at the center some of his Homeric clar ity of vision, as do Homer's heroes in their individual fashions; but the hellish experience of the Grail-quest (his equivalent journey to</page><page sequence="15">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 99 the underworld) refreshes his sight and connects it with that initial in tuition or original inscape by which he had been perceptually liber ated from his most self-torturing "Travail, throes and agonies of the life " (" The Coming of Arthur," 1.75) and upon which he had built his determination to "follow virtue and intelligence." It is not to medievalism, with its grand and grandly faulted myth of man, that the world can turn for fundamental guidance. Medievalism was inevitable and imperious and doomed. It was built on a sub lime human enthusiasm that was both irresistible and false; and it spawned human romance and human burlesque, epic endurance and debilitating pathos, self-deception, self-renewal, and self-annihila tion. As the quest for the Holy Grail revealed its human despair of humanness at a luridly dissolute symbolic level, so the Order of the Round Table itself, with its analogues in the orders of Benedict of Nursii and Francis of Assisi, became a "good custom" that "cor rupted] the world" once individual responsibility was absorbed into a "tale of the tribe," a mechanism (say, even, civilization at its most gracious) substituted for personally motivated, personally performed action. The "tribe" is just as unreal as any other abstraction, be it the Grand Old Man of the anthropomorphic religionists or the gener alized and abstracted Man of the utilitarian moralists. Lancelot's weathering of despair is a starkly isolated existential experience, like that of Achilles or Ulysses wrapped in a different fiction and a differ ent fabric of time. Guinevere has her saving breakthrough only after she has stripped herself of all the lifeless mechanicals by which, in the rituals of the tribe, she has entrenched her diminished self in the false pride of (medieval) voluptuousness; and her final recognition of Ar thur as "the highest and most human too" returns the poem's su preme affirmation to a severely honed classicism. And to the degree that post-Renaissance man turns to the Middle Ages for some magi cal touchstone of redemption, to the degree that the modern man of imagination - say, the poet or the priest - loses sight of the individual in the alluring enticements of the tribe, he will "follow wandering fires, lost in the quagmire." Because to Tennyson, as to Homer, the ultimate image of conscientious man is that of one standing high and alone, under his " arch of hand" straining his eyes to see and, because he stares into the sunrise, never being sure that what he sees are not simply his own eye specks. That, too, is the authentic "Unseen" in</page><page sequence="16">100 BROWNING INSTITUTE STUDIES whose reality Tennyson tells us he always believed, and man's high humanness will carry him on toward it if he will only remember that he was made not to "exist like brutes," but "To follow virtue and in telligence." Idylls of the King is intensely, absorbingly, inexhaustibly literary, and to the literary continuity and reversal which I have here stressed can be fruitfully added many other essentially literary approaches. For example, there is the perpendicularity of its narrative inventive ness, by which its fundamental subject is probed through four dis crete dimensions of its narrative consciousness. Or we may see it panoramically: as our imagination, our recreative eye, becomes ac customed to the depth and meaning of its central unifying action, our fancy, our associative eye, witnesses with increased clarity and ex citement the rich abundance of similitude and dissimilitude with which its characters, thoughts, language, shows, and rhythms are or chestrated. But it is to that central unifying action itself that we must look if we would see the poem quintessentially, to that point of self renewing light - that sunrise, if you will - at which literature and life, reality and unreality, the "Seen" and the "Unseen" meet and be come almost one. The poem's innermost action is perceptual, and it is centered in Arthur: he is perceptually "born" and he perceptually "dies," and everything that happens in between is a matter of seeing - sight, insight, hindsight, true vision, false vision, dulled vision, clouded vision, misvision, preternatural vision, sun-spot vision, my opia, blindness. The intensity and richness of this aesthetic of seeing is grandly celebrated in Carlyle's The Hero as Poet: The seeing eye! It is this that discloses the inner harmony of things; what Na ture meant, what musical idea Nature has wrapped up in these often rough em bodiments_the faculty that enables him to discern the inner heart of things, and the harmony that dwells there (for whatsoever exists has a harmony in the heart of it, or it would not hold together and exist), is not the result of habits or accidents, but the gift of Nature herself; the primary outfit for a Heroic Man in what sort so ever. To the Poet, as to every other, we say first of all, See}6 It was upon an aesthetic of seeing like that celebrated by Carlyle that Tennyson erected his poetic canon. The fall of man is centered in sight and so is his redemption; literature is fundamentally a matter of seeing and so is life. And literature becomes "life at the remove of form and idea," our life distanced to imaginative perspective, in</page><page sequence="17">A PRECARIOUS TURNING 101 poems like Idylls of the King when we see, as Tennyson clearly in tended, that all the many characters in the poem are really one char acter ("a man") and that that character is ourselves: Tout c'est moi. This is the supreme unity of action, unity of perception, unity of fail ure ("one sin") in which the poem is centered; this is what suspends perceptual/moral judgment and induces perceptual/moral awe and the organic response that awe in its turn induces. We are implicated in the poem's every turning, and its ultimate unity is in ourselves. Time and Space are mere modes of consciousness, and our universe cannot cohere around any center but our own: in the metaphor used by Car lyle, unless there is a harmony in ourselves, there can be no harmony in our universe, and neither can "hold together and exist." This is the only source, goal, and significance that any truly distinctive reality can ever have ; all else has about it some degree of unreality and there fore some degree of chaos. Until, like Arthur, we discover that we ex ist, our universe can have no center; and if, like Arthur, we try to lend our discovered selves out, we will of course fail, but we may not fail wholly. NOTES 1. The particular reference is to the poetic tradition as it evolved subsequent to Tenny son, but the frame is very much larger than that. The Tennyson canon is so grand and dis tinctive that, when it is added to the Indo-European poetic hierarchy, it moves that hier archy into imaginative (perceptual, structural, linguistic) spaces that it would not occupy without the addition of his work. 2.
