<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS EDITED BY ROBERT E. BELL The World of the Past. Edited by JACQUETTA HAWKES. Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1963. 2 vols. ix + 601 pp., 6 maps, 24 pls., and 707 pp., 8 maps, 24 pls. $20.00. These two volumes are "In Memory of Leonard Wool- ley, a brilliant excavator and a writer of imagination." The choice of the selections was influenced by the con- cept of the title and is an attempt to give world-wide coverage of major archaeological areas and to present the gradual increase of knowledge of the prehistory of these areas. With a wealth of writing available, "The choice of extracts for this anthology has been determined first of all by the quality of the writing .... The early humanist explorers are often contemptuously treated by modern scientists for their carelessness and addiction to treasure- hunting. But at least they took the trouble to communi- cate gracefully or vigorously with their fellows. Modern archaeologists, on the other hand, are inclined to think that literary skill will diminish, and unnecessary jargon enhance, their scientific reputations." These views repre- sent the tone of this publication and place the editor clearly on the humanist side of the Snow line. There is an "Introduction" of 104 pages by the edi- tor, which is subtitled "Archaeology: Purposes and Pleasures, History, Lost Civilizations, Scientific Prehistory and the Evolution of Man, Modern Archaeology, and Modern Excavation and Discoveries." The first volume presents 108 writings by 60 different authors on "The Old Stone Age and the Evolution of Man," "The New Stone Age and the Beginnings of Farming," "Mesopota- mia and Palestine," and "The Egyptian World." They range from Allegro to Wools and from Thucydides to Grahame Clark. The second volume includes "Asia Minor, Greece and Italy," "India, China and Elsewhere," "Britain and Europe," and "America." There are 112 excerpts from 73 different authors in this volume. They range from Abercromby to Worsaae, and from Julius Ceasar to Giddings. New World archaeology is accorded some 208 pages, and of these, 143 are from Stephens, Squier, Charnay, Anne Maudsley, Sahagun, Prescott, and Bingham; the other excerpts are from Morley, Alberto Ruz, J. Eric Thompson, Vaillant, J. Alden Mason, Worm- ington, Krieger, and Giddings. The coverage in these volumes is extensive, and the selections have been culled from a vast literature. The articles must have been picked after much debate. They are, then, the editor's judgment and were chosen to repre- sent the theme of the volumes. The readers of American Antiquity are probably most familiar with North Ameri- can archaeology, and the bulk of this publication will provide them with writings that they probably have not encountered. Brief introductions precede the selections from the various geographical areas and prehistoric groups, and the particular significance of each individual selection is also presented. This potpourri contains many interesting observations that form part of the history of archaeological develop- ment. For example, there is William Camden's canny recognition that the differential growth and ripening of corn (wheat) disclosed the presence of streets of a Roman port in Kent (first published in 1586), and his additional observation of an apparent contemporary low- ering of sea level. Another example is Droop's com- ment on "mixed" digs, wherein he concludes that women may well be capable of archaeological work but that they should conduct it by themselves. In addition to the value such a compilation has to individuals with a responsible interest in archaeology, the volumes can afford a valuable collateral source for introductory archaeology and history courses. JAMES B. GRIFFIN University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Michigan Petroglyphs of the Glen Canyon Region. CHRISTY G. TURNER, II. Museum of Northern Arizona, Bulletin 38 (Glen Canyon Series No. 4). Flagstaff, 1963. 74 pp., 102 figs., 17 tables, 2 maps. No price given. Because rock art is impossible to collect with shovel or trowel, difficult to analyze since it often cannot be asso- ciated with any cultural complex, and sometimes is be- yond scientific interpretation, its investigation in North America has seemed fruitless to many anthropologists. But in recent years interest has quickened, and an in- creasing number of reports of investigations are appear- ing. These reports have benefitted from sharpened con- cepts and sophisticated techniques, and it is now appar- ent that the study of petrographs can contribute much to our knowledge of prehistoric America. This paper on the petrographs of the Glen Canyon region is such a report and is a welcome addition to the growing litera- ture on this subject. Turner has discovered that there are five petrograph styles in the Glen Canyon and San Juan Canyon areas of northern Arizona and southern Utah, and he has been able to determine their ages by ceramic associations and by deterioration. He suggests certain relationships of the Glen Canyon petrographs to those of other regions and speculates about their origins. The description of petroglyph styles and the discussion of their ages and development is relatively clear. But the reader is likely to be irritated by the photographic illustrations of the various styles. One learns on page seven, for example, that in Style 4 petroglyphs "Design elaboration is ram- pant, with some scenes often having a humorous bent (Fig. 14)." But an examination of Fig. 14 shows only a rather simple anthropomorphic being. If this being is intrinsically humorous or if it appears humorous to mod- 356</page></plain_text>
