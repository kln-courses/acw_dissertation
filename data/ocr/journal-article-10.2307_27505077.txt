<plain_text><page sequence="1">246 Journal of Religion and Health Psychodynamics and the Holy Spirit ORVILLE S. WALTERS The concept of unconscious motivation has had wide acceptance in recent decades, making its appearance in drama, art, literature, law, and education as well as in psychology and psychiatry. The idea has also had wide currency in theology, especially through the literature of the pastoral counseling movement, which has been strongly influenced by psychoanalysis. Many voices within theology have urged that the insights of depth psychology be mobilized to illuminate and perhaps to revise traditional theological concepts. Reinhold Niebuhr, for example, wrote: "We cannot scorn insights in which truth has been distilled from the half-truths of both Freudianism and Neo-Freudianism."1 Samuel Miller, noting that "psychody namics has introduced a new dimension of great power and diversity," urgently advocates exploration of relationships between psychology and theology: "Nothing is more critically needed at the present moment than a definitive study of the relationship of psychodynamic structures to the transcendental realities of theological affirmation."2 Miller recognizes the naturalistic context of psychodynamics, its lack of scientific credentials, and its brash assumption of authority over other criteria of truth, but insists that it be heard: "Psychodynamics is a new dimension of human reality but it is Orville S.

Psychodynamics does not have the whole answer, but it must be included in the new equation."3 Similar pleas have been made by others for an application of psychody namics to theology, especially the work of the Holy Spirit. The appeal by Pennington is characteristic: "The work of the Holy Spirit may be?I would be tempted to say, must be?interpreted in terms of the well-established insights of depth psychology. . . . Any adequate Christian psychology must deal with this issue."4 R. Newton Flew early recognized some of the implications of the new psychology for theology. He imagines "pestilential thoughts" coming "out of the subconscious into the waking consciousness," where they become tempta tion to sinful acts. "Can this spell be broken?" Flew asks. "Is salvation possible for the subconscious?"5 Flew avoided identifying himself with any specific model of personality by choosing the term subconscious. Freud used the word in one of his earliest papers on psychoanalysis,6 but later repudiated it as "incorrect and mislead ing." His dictum that the only proper distinction is between conscious and unconscious became firmly established in psychoanalysis; hence the latter term usually presupposes classical Freudian premises. Which model of personality? Sangster restated Flew's question in a chapter titled "Does the Holy Spirit influence the unconscious?"7 Sangster believed that the Freudian concept had surmounted the obstacles that separate scientific theory from fact. "The existence of the unconscious may now be said to be established beyond scholarly dispute." This conclusion precipitated him into the highly contro versial field of personality theory. A theory is an unsubstantiated hypothesis concerning reality that is not necessarily known to be so and that must be confirmed before it can be accepted as a fact. Personality theory differs from the theory of experimental psychology in refusing to be bound by the rigid discipline and systematic rules that are derived from the natural sciences. Rather, personality theory</page><page sequence="3">248 Journal of Religion and Health consists of speculative reconstructions growing out of clinical interviews and observations.8 Although the unconscious has been described as "an unavoid able inference from experience,"9 it is precisely the inferential nature of the evidence that has blocked psychoanalytic theory in its efforts to achieve recognition as fact. Sangster employed the Freudian constructs of id, ego, and superego, even though the acceptance of a fragmented self violated his declaration of loyalty to "the unity of our mental life."10 However, he also made use of the earlier metaphor of stratification in personality, where ideas "rise to consciousness," and "sink away again" into the depths of one's being. The stratification model is a part of Freud's topographic theory, which imagined a simple conflict between unconscious instinctual urges and anti-instinctual forces. Freud eventually concluded that this scheme was overly simple and aban doned the topographic hypothesis in favor of the structural theory. In that paradigm, conflict occurs among id, ego, and superego, rather than conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. The topographic and the structural theories are neither compatible nor interchangeable.11 Sangster likewise accepted the division of personality into a personal unconscious consisting of repressed memories and a collective unconscious in which are stored memory traces from man's ancestral past. This division follows the Jungian paradigm. He thus borrowed from three theoretical schemes, but since none of these is compatible with any of the others, the result is a scissors-and-paste model lacking over-all consistency. Thus he concludes, "We believe that the Holy Spirit does influence the unconscious,"12 without having been able to fit such an experience into any single theory of personality. In spite of his somewhat uncritical acceptance of divergent psychological constructs, it is to Sangster's resounding credit that he held tenaciously for the primacy of the conscious: Though the gracious influence of God presses, doubtless, upon children and adults in their subconscious mind, his direct dealing with us must be in the conscious mind. . . While no mortal would claim to know all the varied ways in which God deals with</page><page sequence="4">Psychodynamics and the Holy Spirit 249 varied souls, it were best to hold firmly to the principle that God deals with us always as persons, and that we must say "yes" to Him in the conscious mind.13 Composite of incompatibles The mingling of discordant theories is even more pronounced in a study by Ernest White.14 The author opens with a question from Sangster, "What effect has the new psychology had on the quest for holiness?" then echoes Flew's original question, "Is salvation possible for the subconscious?" His book essays to formulate an answer in terms of modern psychological theory. White accepts the idea that conduct is largely motivated by forces arising from the unconscious. He declares that the basic theory of the unconscious has stood the test and that "we should no longer look to reason for the motivation of conduct."15 The unconscious as conceived by White is a composite of Freudian and Jungian models. It is "a strange world of primitive images" with "repulsive and frightening monsters inhabiting the depths."16 Here are both the reservoir of repression and the ancestral collective uncon scious; here, too, are id, ego, superego, and ego ideal, libido and sublimation, the shadow self and the archetypes, one of which is the Image of God. Even after this unparsimonious roll call of entities, White affirms an inviolate wholeness of personality. It is false psychology and false theology, he asserts, to suppose that one part is redeemed and another part left untouched. The new birth is a process, always unconscious and independent of man's will, that brings a new force into the chaos of the unconscious. A new and supernatural driving-power is introduced into the unconscious as Christ brings harmony where there was discord.17 Conversion, in contrast, results from a conscious act of the will in which a man turns to God.18 The Devil seeks to work evil in man on the unconscious as well as the conscious level.19 In the end, White concludes, we are all accompanied in the journey of life by the primitive, untamed Jungian shadow self,20 and must accept the evil in us as a necessary part of our makeup.21 The efforts of others who have tried, as White has done, to combine the systems of Jung and Freud have called attention to a basic incongruity. Hostie has deplored efforts to unify the two systems by trying "to insert Jung's</page><page sequence="5">250 Journal of Religion and Health grandiose abstractions, such as the archetypes and the self, into Freud's quite differently orientated system." Citing an earlier effort to reconcile Freud and Jung "by taking odd pieces from their two systems and soldering them together," Hostie comments, "This kind of eclecticism . . . only serves to heighten the confusion of language that was so rife in the camp of the depth psychologists from the beginning."22 Edward Glover discredits Jung's system because of its vagueness, its internal inconsistencies, and the mutual incompatibility of Freudian and Jungian theories. He declares that there is no possible connection between the unconscious of Freud and that of Jung.23 According to Glover, Jung's failure to distinguish between primary and secondary processes obliterates the distinction between unconscious and preconscious, and leads a grand retreat to conscious psychology.24 He sees no way to bridge the gulf between the two systems by eclectic compromises. Redemption of the subconscious In a study of the Holy Spirit, E. Stanley Jones also asks whether the divine nature can extend to the subconscious mind. He re-echoes Flew's twenty-five year-old query: "The most important question for theology is, Can the subconscious be redeemed?"25 According to Jones, conversion occurs in the conscious, but the subconscious, in which reside our basic drives, remains unconverted. He accepts the idea that "we are largely determined from the subconscious." The Spirit is in control of the conscious mind, but the elemental desires are in control of the subconscious. "The conscious mind determines the actions, our subconscious mind determines the reactions."26 Following conversion, "usually within a year," the subconscious urges begin to reassert themselves. In the subconscious is a Trojan horse. The hidden inmates spring out and a civil war between the converted conscious and the unconverted subconscious minds ensues. Jones believes that the work of the Holy Spirit is largely if not entirely in the subconscious, a dynamic redemptive force designed especially to cleanse and to convert the subconscious. "With the surrender of the subconscious to</page><page sequence="6">Psychodynamics and the Holy Spirit 251 the Holy Spirit?surrendering 'all we know,' the conscious, and 'all we don't know,' the subconscious, he moves into the subconscious and takes over control of these basic driving urges."27 Jones acknowledges the holistic principle, but his construct functions in segments. He is able to say that "anxiety in the subconscious produces a tension in the whole person," but conceives of a conversion of the conscious that leaves the subconscious unconverted. His psychological theory does not explain why commitment of the self at the time of conversion fails to include the subconscious, or how subsequent conscious surrender of the subconscious as a necessary step to its conversion is possible. Both the assumption that the unconscious is largely determinative in human motivation and the idea that personality is divisible into functionally insulated parts are highly questionable. Unconscious as Holy Spirit Lindsay Dewar offers a more ambitious psychological interpretation dealing with the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.28 After examining biblical and patristic teachings, he turns to the writings of Freud and Jung. He rejects Freud's concept of the unconscious as unsatisfactory because it was represented as a closed system. He recognizes the ambiguous and self-contradictory character of Jung's concepts, but pronounces them the more intelligible of the two. Dewar frequently combines concepts and terms that belong exclusively to one system or the other. He rejects the Freudian id, but refers to the psychic energy of the ego and speaks of "Christ taking over the superego."29 These terms borrowed from the Freudian structural hypothesis are not really essential to Dewar's principal thesis, which identifies the activity of the Holy Spirit with the purposive and ideological activity of the unconscious de scribed by Jung. Dewar regards the healing forces of nature as "but another name for the Holy Spirit."30 The psychiatric patient has "become cut off from the instinctual roots of his being?in a word, from the beneficent leadings of the Holy Spirit."31 This matching of a theological with a psychological concept involves a</page><page sequence="7">252 Journal of Religion and Health mingling of categories that can be justified only if an identity is acknowledged by both disciplines. Psychology is not likely to validate the influence of the Holy Spirit, or to agree that it is "a matter of actual experience, as solid a reality as that of electro-magnetism."32 Theology, for its part, is likely to interpret Dewar's assertion of equivalents as a reduction of the supernatural to the natural. In the end, Dewar finds that inspiration reaches us by the route of the unconscious, but that all such deliverances must be judged by conscious reason. The unconscious is "open to the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit," which accounts for beneficent effects on the conscious mind. He arrives at the same conclusion as William James, who said, "If the grace of God miraculously operates, it probably operates through the subliminal door."33 The primacy of the conscious In his appeal for differentiation between the psychological and the religious, Miller wisely emphasized the fallacy of rewriting all religion in analytic terms, since psychodynamics is but one aspect of human reality.34 What needs equal emphasis is that psychodynamics is not necessarily a hidden dynamics, with the unconscious having a dominant role. An earlier study35 has traced the rise and decline of an ill-advised disparagement of the conscious and an overly generous evaluation of the scientific status of depth psychology. Freud's depreciation of the conscious and his contention that the uncon scious is the "true psychical reality"36 was from its beginning a gratuitous assumption. Gordon Allport has long contended that conscious values and intentions are far more important than Freudian and other irrationalist theories of motivation are willing to allow.37 While "psychodynamics" has often been equated with psychoanalytic theory, the term has come to stand for a general science of motivation that recognizes the autonomy of a conscious, purposive self. Allport concludes, "In general the Freudian theory seems best to fit certain types of neurotic disorder but falls short as a formula for the healthy personality."38 A growing emphasis in the sciences of man</page><page sequence="8">Psychodynamics and the Holy Spirit 253 upon the whole person in his environment is displacing the fragmented psychoanalytic model, with its anthropomorphic internal conflicts. Subconscious is a highly relative quality. The absence of any sharp line between unconscious and preconscious and the great variability in ease of recovering "unconscious" memories are well known. Freud was well ac quainted with the contention that so-called unconscious material is really faintly conscious, and although he sought to refute the idea,39 it is widely recognized. May, for example, comments upon the continual surprise of both analyst and patient when, upon the return of a forgotten memory, the patient reports the feeling of having known it all the time.40 Sangster was correct in asserting that the levels of the Freudian topographic theory "are not separate strata, but merge the one into the other."41 Scientific answer to a theological question? Flew's question, "Is salvation possible for the subconscious?" and Miller's declaration, "the roots of faith must seek the darker depths of the subcon scious,"42 tie together a theological verity and a theoretical concept isolated from personality theory. Both men seem to be trying to find scientific answers to theological questions. The principal obstacle to such communication at this stage in the develop ment of personality science is the stubbornly incompatible character of the categories employed by theology and by psychology. Without mutually acceptable presuppositions and a common language, it is impossible to describe the reality of theistic encounter in psychodynamic terms except by reduction. The difficulty was anticipated by Miller in his recognition that "any attempt to testify to the reality of the transcendent by recourse to empirical phenomena" might be balked by the nature of the method.43 Stinnette has well described the separate domains: "The problems of human existence are not ultimately accessible to technical reason but, rather, require transfiguring faith in the context of personal commitment?a community of commitment as well as a community of analysis."44</page><page sequence="9">254 Journal of Religion and Health While the community of analysis coldly asks for credentials at the door when a new psychological system seeks admission, the community of commit ment has often seemed overly fascinated by ambiguity and mystery. Thus, a theologian writes: "I suspect that the reality of the atonement will be disclosed not at the level of the conscious mind, but in the depths of the subconscious . . . where the patterns form for new syntheses of psychic energy."45 This is more like a ticket to obscurity than the illumination delivered by a scientific insight. Psychodynamics candidly acknowledges its own immaturity?"an emerg ing field of psychology, whose theories and techniques are still struggling to attain fruition."46 Psychology likewise confesses that it is "now badly dismem bered in contradictory theories."47 Theology cannot afford to be less rigorous in its demands upon these disciplines than they are upon themselves. This review of efforts by some theologians to illuminate the doctrine of the Holy Spirit by drawing upon contemporary psychodynamic theory empha sizes the prematurity, if not the futility, of such attempts. While a readiness to clarify theological concepts through the progress of psychological science should be encouraged, the limitations inherent in such a process are clearly evident. Refetences 1.
