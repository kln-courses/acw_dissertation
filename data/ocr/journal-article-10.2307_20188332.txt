<plain_text><page sequence="1">Land Mar ks Wippich's Rock Garden Benton County Some believed Louis Wippich brilliant. Others thought him mad. He was likely somewhere in between, little different than most. But while many trudge quietly through life, Wippich made a loud metaphysical statement. A disciple of Theosophy, he dedicated a quarter-century to turning his home in Sauk Rapids into an arresting, if somewhat chaotic, tribute to the movement's founder, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Blavat sky helped establish the Theosophi cal Society in 1875. Its members em braced reincarnation while rejecting the concept of an anthropomorphic God existing outside of nature. In 1932, when Wippich was working for the Great Northern Rail way Company in nearby St. Cloud, he began building his rock garden. Unlike the more ordered Ellsworth Rock Garden in Voyageurs National Park, Wippich's evolved into a jum ble of structures and formations. He constructed a 45-foot-high granite tower rising above his shack dwell ing, as well as two large granite-and sandstone "mountains." One featured carved passageways and an altar named the Seven Steps to Hell. The other had protruding concrete slabs extending over a reflecting pool like diving boards. Wippich "preached over his world" from a concrete pul pit cantilevered above the pool, and the garden incorporated other struc tures, including a Doric temple and a "meditation chamber." Wippich died in 1973. It is un known if he returned to his utopia " f''j?-?- 'few mm, la?l 9K* -, &lt;^-?MA't? in another form, as he believed he would. Thankfully, the rock garden has been preserved by a local family that appreciates Wippich's efforts and Sauk Rapids's history. ?Denis Gardner Denis Gardner is writing a book featuring many of Minnesota 's National Register of Historic Places properties. *Sources: Ted Sherarts and Karon Sher arts, "Louis C.
