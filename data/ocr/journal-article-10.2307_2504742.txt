<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEHRU AND HISTORY BALKRISHNA GOVIND GOKHALE Historians of nationalism have regarded the growth of an historical con- sciousness as one of the vital factors contributing to the development of nationalism, especially in the non-Western countries.' This new historical awareness was certainly a part of the complex of ideas comprising the phenomenon of nationalism in India. Almost every nationalist leader of note used the Indian past almost as a defense against the despondency created in the public mind by subjection to British rule. Gandhi consis- tently pointed to this greatness whenever occasion demanded it, as did Jawaharlal Nehru.2 Nehru, however, was unique in his historical aware- ness and differed significantly in his treatment of the past from Gandhi. Unlike Gandhi, who found his being completely within the core of the Hindu tradition, Nehru was, in his own words, "a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere" and his "thoughts and approach to life" were "more akin to what is called Western than Eastern."' Where Gandhi was totally immersed in India, Nehru, be- cause of his early fascination for Marxism and Socialism, often attempted to view the Indian past within the context of the world at large. The differences in the historical consciousness of the two reflected the interplay of tradition and modernity in the history of Indian nationalism. Gandhi (1869-1948) was older than Nehru (1889-1964) by two decades, but the difference in "historical" time was much greater than the chronological. They represented the two ends of the Indian social and intellectual spectrum. Gandhi, a Bania by caste, lived his childhood in the lingering memories of the feudal past of Gujarat in western India and was raised in a family steeped in the Vaishnava tradition. Nehru was a Kashmiri Brahman, son of a successful and affluent Westernized attorney- 1. Boyd C.

Gandhi went to an Indian public school while Nehru was tu- tored by a Theosophist, Ferdinand T. Brooks, who was part Irish and part French or Belgian. While in London, Gandhi was more interested in veg- etarianism; Nehru's Harrow and Cambridge days were strewn with a "vague kind of Cyrenaicism" and political debates.4 Nehru was enamored of science and valued the scientific temper. He was also much more deeply moved by the Russian Revolution. Where Gandhi was unquestionably a traditional Hindu, Nehru became a "humanist" who resented being neatly categorized within the four corners of a single "ism." Nehru's fascination with history was a continuing process which can be traced over at least three decades. Eight periods of incarceration in British jails totaling nine years gave him a singular opportunity of looking back on the human and Indian past. His Autobiography (1941; begun in June 1934 and completed in February 1935) is as much a piece of historical literature as are his two other works, Glimpses of World Histoiy (1934) and The Discovery of India (1946; begun in 1941 but completed during April and September 1944). Toward Gandhi he stood in the relationship of a disciple but scarcely a spiritual heir. Of Gandhi he wrote: "And then Gandhi came. He was like a powerful current of fresh air that made us stretch ourselves and take deep breaths, like a beam of light that pierced the darkness and removed the scales from our eyes, like a whirlwind that upset many things, but most of all the working of people's minds." But he also went on to add: "Much that he said we only partially accepted or sometimes did not accept at all."5 What Gandhi did for Nehru was to transform the aristocrat into a leader of India's millions, in whose midst he felt a certain emotional exalta- tion though intellectually he could not "idealize the conception of the mas- ses" and added, "as far as possible I try to avoid thinking of them as a theoretical abstraction.' '6 Nehru returned to India in 1912 and spent the next few years in the provincial atmosphere of Allahabad practicing law, which seemed to him boring. In 1917 he became involved in the Home Rule movement launched by Mrs. Annie Besant (1847-1933), the Theosophist, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920), the radical nationalist. In 1916 he married the seventeen-year old Kamala Kaul (1899-1936), also a Kashmiri Brahman from a successful business family of Delhi. It was a marriage arranged in the traditional Indian fashion and of this union was born Indira Gandhi (1917), the future Prime Minister. Nehru was first imprisoned in 1921-1922 4.

II From 1924 to 1964 Nehru dominated the Indian National Congress as its principal spokesman (next in importance only to Gandhi) on nationalism and internationalism. He had traveled extensively to various European countries, the Soviet Union, and also to the United States. His early "vague kind of Cyrenaicism" or the rational pursuit of happiness in life was soon overlaid with the influence of Marxism. This Marxist influence stemmed both from his reading of Marxist literature and his early admira- tion for the Soviet Union, which, as he says, "has launched on one of the mightiest experiments in history." His first visit to Russia in 1927 created in him a certain enthusiastic response, though much of it was later tem- pered by events of the Staliist era of the 1930s.7 Similarly his attachment to Marxism underwent subtle but significant changes from the period of the thirties to that of the fifties. In his earlier statements he often spoke of the Marxist method of thinking and analysis and stated that he "accepted the fundamentals of the socialist theory." "Much in the Marxist philosophical outlook," he says, "I could accept without much difficulty: its monism and nonduality of mind and matter, the dynamics of matter and the dialectic of continuous change by evolution as well as leap, through action and interac- tion, cause and effect, thesis, antithesis and synthesis." Like other intellec- tuals of his time in India and elsewhere, he felt that the Marxist analysis of historical developments stimulated his thought. But, he goes on to add, ''it did not satisfy completely, nor did it answer all the questions in my mind, and almost unawares a vague idealist approach would creep into my mind, something rather akin to the Vedanta approach. It was not a difference between mind and matter but rather of something that lay beyond the mind." For Nehru the trouble with Marxism was that it proved to be "too narrow a creed and whatever its virtue as an economic approach, it failed to resolve our basic doubts. Life is something more than economic growth, though it is well to realize that economic growth is a basic foundation of growth and progress.'"8 But if Marxism as a theory of social history was less than adequate, something of the Marxist rhetoric persisted in his thought and writings. The other element was nationalism, which Nehru defines as "essentially a group memory of past achievements, traditions and experience." As one 7.

But he recognized that it could be "an unreliable friend and an unsafe historian," a "narrowing creed" though at certain stages in the development of a country it plays a beneficial and positive role. The internationalist in Nehru constantly watched over nationalism and especially in the task of interpreting history he frequently attempted to divest himself of the kind that said "My country right or wrong."9 Of all the nationalist leaders of India, Nehru was the least "Hindu" in his ways of thought and modes of personal life, and his "secularity" has been described as "open, avowed and lifelong."10 Speaking on December 29, 1929 to the Lahore meeting of the Indian National Congress he said: "I was born a Hindu, but I do not know how far I am justified in calling myself one or speaking in behalf of the Hindus." Religion did not attract him, for in some of its aspects he found it closely associated with superstitious practices and dogmatic beliefs. He called its approach to life unscientific. The next world did not interest him. But he readily admitted that religion "did supply some deeply felt inner need of human nature." And if mysticism irritated him, he was also aware that "the mysterious will continue to remain the mysterious, and life with all its changes will still remain a bundle of good and evil, a succession of conflicts, a curious combination of incompatible and mutually hostile urges." His preferences were all for science and the scientific method, and he claimed that his "early approach to life's problems had been more or less scientific." But as the years passed, he came to feel that "science does not tell us much, or for the matter of that, anything about the purpose of life." He could not answer "what is truth?" for he did not "know for certain, and perhaps our truths are relative and absolute truth is beyond us." Man, he felt, operates largely in the world of his own perceptions, and the best one can do is to demand that these be rational. By the middle 1940s he had begun to recog- nize the role of "intuition" and "other methods of sensing truth and real- ity.""1 Six years before his death, in 1958, he came to adopt the position: "We talk of things material and spiritual, and yet it is a little difficult to draw a line between them. Every great wave of human thought which has affected millions of human beings has something spiritual in it. The great revolutions, whether in the United States or France or Russia or China, 9.

The circle was now complete.'2 ill His disclaimer that he was in any sense a proper historian has not spared Nehru the criticisms of academic historians. S. Gopal, the most recent biographer of Nehru, points to his "half-liberal, half-Marxist view of his- tory" and his ideology "based more on sympathy than on conviction." His Discovery of India Gopal calls "a great jumble of a book which bears the marks of haste and tension" in its outlook and chides its "woolly writing." "All his ideas about race, for example," concludes Gopal, "make little sense."Another writer calls Nehru "a romantic historian." 13 The closest that Nehru came to any system of thought, especially in his philosophy of history, is that of humanism. Corliss Lamont defines humanism as "a philosophy of joyous service for the greater good of all humanity in this natural world and advocating the methods of reason, sci- ence and democracy." Of the two varieties of humanism, liberal and Marx- ist, Nehru was much closer to the former; for in spite of his use of Marxist ideas, such as the polarity of opposing forces, the Gandhian influence on him was so deep and pervasive that Nehru could not subscribe to the violence implicit in the Marxist view of conflict resolution. Especially valu- able for him was Gandhi's concept of ends and means, with its emphasis on ethical means as the only way to secure right ends. Lamont has listed ten distinct characteristics of the humanist philosophy, almost all of which Nehru embraced, especially in his view of history.14 The development in his thinking from the 1920s to the 1960s gradually led him to balance his insistence on reason against the human need for the intuitively perceived "mysterious," the demands of ethics against the urge to success however contrived. Nehru never claimed to be an historian as such, but called himself "a dabbler in many things." As a part of his academic preparation for his Tripos in the Natural Sciences at Cambridge, he became well versed in the scientific lore of the early twentieth century. Besides, throughout his politi- cal career he seems to have kept up his wide-ranging reading, and was 12. Jawaharlal Nehru, Nehru on Society, Education, and Culture, ed. S. R.

H-e became particularly interested in those periods with which he could "identify" himself and such a past '"crowded in upon him." It was a matter of his search for the collective " roots." He was often torn between the history of man qua man and of the masses. Of history today he wrote that "it is the history, not of the individ- ual so much, although again I do not deny the importance of the individual, but it is the history of a mass and sometimes a mass without a definite clear face about it." But he was more fascinated by the phenomenon of man, a singular creature with "the desire to find out and learn," a curious "mix- ture of the good and the bad, the great and little" confronted with problems of his own universal humanity conventionally called Asiatic or European. He is endowed with an amazing spirit and a dignity all his own, passionate in his search for truth, involved in an often lone but endless struggle against "adverse surroundings.' He saw man "in the face of innumerable difficul- ties" in "repeated martyrdom and crucifixion" but also "rising again and again and triumphing over every adversity."15 He looked at history as a mighty river that "has run on from age to age, continuously, interminably, with its eddies and whirlpools and backwaters, and still rushes on to an unknown sea." He speaks in terms of entire civilizations in a somewhat Toynbeean manner. "There are," he writes to his daughter, "ups and downs, good periods and bad kings and emperors come and go, and dynas- ties change." His view of history is almost cyclical, for in the life of every living civilization there are ''periods of growth and decay and then growth again." But there is always breathing and pulsating a "dynamic core" which is able to survive "repeatedly periods of decay and disruption." History usually works slowly through the centuries "though sometimes there are periods of rush and burst-ups." History is a "continuous whole," which has within itself the wisdom of the past which is "the accumulated experience of the human race.'"16 In his letters to his daughter entitled Glimpses of World History and his Discovery of India, Nehru shows an astonishing sweep in his knowledge and perception of the ongoing drama of civilizations, in all parts of the world as well as in India. He speaks of prehistoric man and his painful rise from barbarism to civilization, of Egypt, Sumer, Akkad and Babylon, the Harappan and early Chinese cultures, the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas, Greece and Rome, medieval and modern Europe, the revolution that created the United States and the Civil War that almost tore it asunder, of 15.

Specialists might find some parts of this grand vista too sweeping, but when it is understood that here is a politician involved from one decade to another in the politics of nationalism, one cannot withhold one's admiration for his unusual grasp and sense of history. In his explanation of the causes and results of historical events Nehru generally emphasizes the role of economic factors. He says: "The long course of history shows us a succession of different forms of government and changing economic forms of production and organization. The two fit in and shape each other.'" He admits that he is a "little too fond of running down kings and princes" for he sees "little in their kind to admire or do reverence to." "Real history," for him, "should deal, not with a few indi- viduals here and there, but with the people who make up a nation, who work and by their labour produce the necessaries and luxuries of life, and who in a thousand different ways act and react on each other. Such a history of man would really be a fascinating story." Of capitalism he has a visceral distrust, for it brings into being the "law of the jungle"; and the theme of the exploitation of the weak by the powerful is fairly constant. But he also admits that "capitalism has been of the greatest service to the world" and it is only when capitalism turns into imperialism that its pro- gressive nature is transformed into a tyranny. He inveighs against British imperialism in India but also gives credit to British rule as an agent of modernization. He says: "But one great benefit the English did confer on India. The very impact of their new and vigourous life shook up India and brought about a feeling of political unity and nationality" and English edu- cation "put Indians in touch with current Western thought."17 As an historian, Nehru was particularly interested in the subject of in- teraction between Asia and the Western world. He views it as an encounter between two disparate worlds with their own distinctive world views, eco- nomic and social organizations, methods of work, and value systems. This is particularly so for the post-Industrial Revolution period. He notices a certain passivity in Asian history and contrasts it with the "dynamic na- ture" of European history at certain periods. This encounter was particu- larly characterized by the conflict 'between two approaches to the problem 17.

Western society is a "dynamic society" with a "modern" consciousness, whereas Indian society has been "wedded to medieval habits of thought." It is this Western dynamism and "modern" habits of thought that enabled Europe to work out the technological and scientific revolutions which assured the West its predominant role in the century of 1850-1950. The West -brought technological and economic changes to bear on non-Western societies, introducing in the realm of ideas "shock and change, a widening of the horizon which had so long been confined within a narrow shell." The ability of the West to control the forces of nature brought it wealth and power but in the process it forgot that man, in order to be really happy, must also control himself. This was the failure of the "acquisitive society" that the West had created and that, with its greed, exploitation, and war, was poised to overwhelm and destroy the vitality of the rest of the world. But despite its faults it has been a "magnificent civilization. It has brought higher standards to the people of the West through science and technology. It has produced magnificent literature, great music, great art." Though the West is now in the process of losing its dominance "much that is best in European civilization should survive." The new civilization that will arise out of the ashes of the post-industrial and post-colonial period, Nehru hopes, will combine the best in the East and the West.18 In such statements the contrast between Gandhi's view of the West and that of Nehru is apparent. Gandhi was almost implacably opposed to much that he found in Western science, technology, and civilization of the mod- ern period and urged a return to a culture of "bread labor" and "village republics" as a way out of the dilemma of the modern man. To Nehru, Western science and technology "have freed humanity from many of its burdens" and created a power for man which he must use with wisdom lest that power destroy the world. It is impossible to turn back the clock of human history, for it is impossible to leap from the twentieth century to the hypothetical bliss of a remote and romantic past which is "dead and gone" and India's "immortal civilization does not help us greatly in solving the problem of today." 19 Nehru's view of Indian history is particularly interesting. He reacts to the Indian past in two distinct ways. As a rationalist he is not unaware of the weaknesses and strengths of the country and its culture. He speaks of 18.

But there were periods when India tended to fall back and "be- come a bit of a fossil; her society was crystallized in old tradition; her social system lost its energy and life and began to stagnate." India has always been full of diversity, receiving into its being diverse cultural streams from the Middle East and the West yet able somehow to weave a viable garment out of different and differing strands, "a varied and tolerant culture," with "a deep understanding of life and its mysterious ways."20 But Nehru also responded to India emotionally. He speaks of the "per- sonality" and "soul" of India, of the "vital impulses" that gave her strength, and of her "destiny." It is in this that he seems to part company with the Marxist historian for whom "imponderables" such as the "Indian soul" are fundamentally unacceptable. He sees India in all her poverty and degradation with enough of nobility and greatness about her; and though she was overburdened with ancient tradition and present misery and her eyelids were a little weary she had "a beauty wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions." Behind and within her battered body one could still glimpse a majesty of soul. Through long ages she had trafficked with strangers and added them to her own big family, and witnessed days of glory and decay, and suffered humiliation and terrible sorrow, and seen many a strange sight. Overwhelmed again and again, her spirit was never con- quered. . . . About her there is the elusive quality of a legend of long ago; some enchantment seems to have held her mind. She is a myth and an idea, a dream and a vision, and yet very real and present and pervasive. There are terrifying glimpses of dark corridors which seem to lead back to primeval night, but also there is the fulness and warmth of the day about her. Shameful and repellent she is occasion- ally, perverse and obstinate, sometimes even a little hysteric, this lady with a past. Such lyrical anthropomorphism would be unacceptable to a workaday historian, but Nehru was unabashed, for he could always say in his disarm- ing way that he could not "write academically" of past events in the manner of an historian or scholar, but was a son of India who had set out to "discover" her. He was conscious that it is "absurd, of course, to think of India or any country as a kind of anthropomorphic entity." But Nehru was often perceptive enough to suggest that "the awakening of India was two- fold: she looked to the West, and at the same time she looked at herself and her own past" - a theme which has led some modern historians to argue that it was a twofold revolution from which Indian nationalism stemmed, namely a revolution against her own past and against Britain.21 20.

They were the ordinary men and women in the streets who are not "usually heroic." But, he warns, "a time comes when a whole people become full of faith and then even simple ordinary men and women become heroes and history becomes stirring and epoch-making. Great leaders have something in them which inspires a whole people and makes them do great deeds." Such leaders "link up the past with the future," restore the spirituall unity of the people" and make that unity "an emotional experience." And though he does not subscribe to the theory of the length of Cleopatra's nose as a decisive factor in human history, he seldom forgets that people as individuals, curious mixtures of emotion and reason, are at once the clay, the wheel, the potter, and pot of history.22 IV Finally, in his own "rambling" way Nehru offers us some of his percep- tions of the history of civilizations. Civilization, according to him, "is the theme of history." The "amazing spirit of man," in spite of crises and disasters, progresses ever upward. He does not lose his dignity or faith in the values he cherishes. "Plaything of nature's mighty forces, less than a speck of dust in this vast universe, he has hurled defiance at the elemental powers, and with his mind, cradle of revolution, sought to master them. Whatever gods there be, there is something godlike in man, as there is also something of the devil in him." Human history, he says, "shows us two principles at work, the principle of continuity and the principle of change. They appear to be opposed to each other and, yet, each has something of the other." Economic factors do fashion the forms of a civilization, but its contents are made of "vast spiritual elements"; for, in man's being and becoming, the visible and the invisible worlds interpenetrate and of this invisible world, which guides the purpose of life, science can tell us hardly anything. Culture is a precipitate of a civilization, for culture is the reflec- tion of "human well-being," the basis of a "good life," physically and mentally. For culture to attain its true being there must be freedom of the mind and the spirit. It is "some inner growth" manifest in myriad traits such as a capacity to comprehend and communicate, openness of the mind, tolerance, compassion, loyalty to fellow man, restraint over oneself. There is an up and down and up again rhythm to human history, and "civiliza- tions, like empires, fall not so much because of the strength of the enemy outside, as through the weakness and decay within." A time comes in the themes see P. Munz and B. Gupta, "Revolution and Tradition in Modern Indian History," Journal of Indian History 44 (1966), 139-161. 22. Glimpses, 2; Discovery, 26, 27, 281.</page><page sequence="11">NEHRU AND HISTORY 321 life of a civilization when its "pulse weakens and the breath of life seems to grow less and less." That is when the creative spirit is paralyzed. This loss of the creative spirit makes society, which is "essentially a dynamic, changing, growing thing," static. At that point either an outside force overwhelms the civilization or it is convulsed by a social revolution disrupt- ing social and economic organization and causing pain and suffering.23 While creation is a sign of life, the creative role is made manifest essen- tially in a minority. This minority, however, must draw its sustenance and inspiration from the masses; it must be "in tune with the majority" and must always try to lift the latter upward and make it advance so that the gap between the two is lessened and a "stable and progressive culture results." When the bond between the creative minority and the masses is snapped, "there is a loss of social unity in society as a whole, and ulti- mately that minority itself loses its creativeness and becomes barren and sterile. Or else it gives place to another creative or vital force which society throws up." This creative minority is responsible for the creation of poetry and art - a "'true mirror" of a people's life - philosophy and music as well as scientific and technological ideas. The creative spirit is nursed by man's "basic urges," which can become smothered by regimentation, whether by an autocratic elite or regimented masses. Autocracy and reg- imentation lead to closing the mind, making the whole society stagnant and increasingly decadent. The free creativity of the minority and the equally free energy of the masses are the two essentials for a growing and dynamic civilization and its creative culture.24 Nehru is especially exercised over periods of decay in the history of India. He sees in India a "split personality" manifest in "the broadest tolerance and catholicity of thought and opinion" and the "narrowest so- cial forms of behaviour." This decay is first seen at the end of the "Gold- en" or Gupta age (circa A.D. 320-500) and again at the end of the first millennium after Christ, when India was "drying up and losing her creative genius and vitality" probably due to the "loss of political freedom." "The expanding economy of India," he says, "had ended and there was a strong tendency to shrink" because of the "growing rigidity and exclusiveness of the Indian social structure as represented chiefly by the caste system," which "sapped the creative faculty and developed a narrow, small group, and parochial outlook" culminating in the final emergence of feudalism. Such periods of decline recurred in the seventeenth to the nineteenth cen- turies, and the British conquest was the final result. Nehru states his own view: "We can almost measure the growth and advance of India and the decline of India by relating them to periods when India had her mind open 23.

The more she closed it up the more static she became." But he is optimistic about India and her destiny, for though an old nation "she has within her something of the spirit and dynamic quality of youth."25 As he progressed from the 1920s to the 1960s, Nehru was becoming less and less certain about his "philosophy." In the mid-1940s he asked: "What was my philosophy of life?" and answered, "I did not know." Romanti- cism, Marxism, and Vedanta had attracted him from time to time. He had firmly believed once that science had practically all the answers and was becoming a mighty instrument for the transformation of human life. But even science seemed to stop at the periphery where the known and un- known met, for it was more interested in asking about the "how" of things and not so much about the "why" of life. Also, there was the persistent danger of science turning itself into a destructive monster when "isolated from moral discipline and ethical considerations." All that remained to him was a firm belief in the "amazing spirit of man" and his history, to which one must constantly return in order to understand man's current predica- ment and influence the path to the future. In order to do this meaningfully, an historian must have empathy for the urges, impulses, dangers, and dis- asters, joys and sorrows reflected in the chronicle of a nation's past. His- tory must reveal the succession of events that took place, and the great spirits that have left their imprint on its dust; furthermore, it must show not only how the events were inter-related but also how they related to the spirits that shaped the form of history. In such a task an historian with "a blank mind incapable of human feelings, desires, urges, aspirations, just reflecting somebody else's mind" is of little use, for "there is no such thing in the wide world as an objective view except for the objective fool." Any man with "guts" has "views." He should not allow his views to "distort his vision"; but if he has no views of his own, "he can never enter into the spirit of humanity" to reveal, which is the function of the historian. Writing history, therefore, is an exercise in preserving a delicate balance between a relentless pursuit of facts and an unfailing sense of the mysterious in man, a respect for the scientific method and a recognition that where science stops at asking the how of the world, the historian must pursue the why of man and his civilization.26 Wake Forest University 25.
