<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS 35.4 MARCH 1975 FORGIVENESS By MARTIN HUGHES IN reply to Mr. Gingell ('Forgiveness and Power', ANALYSIS 34.6, pp. 180-3), I argue that Christians who speak of God as all-forgiving show an excellent understanding of what forgiveness is. Forgiveness is the cancellation of deserved hostility and the substitu- tion of friendlier attitudes. It has important consequences, for which it is highly valued-socially, in that the offender can hold up his head again, and inwardly, in the quietening of remorse. Forgiveness has a discretionary nature, and the discretion belongs to the injured. This aspect of forgiveness may make it seem arbitrary and unreasonable, and there may be doubt whether the important and valu- able consequences mentioned really should flow from it: why should my life be easy because I have injured an indulgent and soft-hearted man, and yours miserable because you have injured (perhaps in the same way) one who is stern or spiteful? Rational moralists have long found this a severe problem. Seneca, who wrote an essay On Clemency addressed to Nero of all people, was very well aware of the discretionary nature of forgiveness in the entourage of an absolute monarch, where even formal justice was a personal matter and might be highly tinctured by transient emotions (Loeb edition, pp. 414, 430)-yet he makes an interesting effort to combine discretion with rules, only to end up with a complex contradiction: it is a rule that we always use discretion significantly to reduce penalties (both public and personal, as I take it) from what, under the rules, is due (ibid., pp. 434, 448). Butler, in his ninth Sermon, seems to bury the discretion of the injured under an alleged duty to assimilate one's feelings to those of a disinterested but virtuous bystander. On this sort of view, the principle that only the injured can forgive becomes, at best, a linguistic triviality: all that is morally important cleaves to the ideal observer. Butler might then have a kind of answer to Mr. Gingell, but it would leave him with a very etiolated Christianity, in which the sense of personal involvement of God with the sinner was lost. But Butler's view is quite coherent. If we treat the discretion of the injured as morally important, we express a moral conviction, not a logical insight. Discretionary forgiveness cannot fully be regulated by definite and universalized moral rules. If I adopt such rules, I cannot treat others as having the right to forgive or not at their discretion when they are in- jured, but only as having the duty to forgive or not according to my II3</page><page sequence="2">114 ANALYSIS rules: in a way, I make myself the ideal observer. But completely un- fettered individual discretion may become a matter of temperamental caprice, as Seneca feared. Yet discretion remains discretion and does not become caprice if it is receptive of informal advice. If someone advises me formally, he gives me orders: he propounds deductions from rules he thinks I accept, or is certain I should accept, and I am under threat of condemnation if I do not comply. If someone advises me informally, he understands and condones my doubts about certain rules, or sees that we may not be able to show rigorously how accepted rules apply concretely. Still, we often seek informal advice "to clarify the issue": we see at least what the rules are we have to consider, and this forces us-since otherwise it is very hard to see the real import of abstractly formulated rules-to think of similar cases and the decisions of others: thus our discretion loses its pure individualism and its tincture of caprice, since it comes to take serious account of the experience, maybe the wisdom, of others. We usually find that there are others whose decisions we respect-even if, or especially if, we do not believe we would have chosen so well in their place. If we can, it is to people we so respect that we go for informal advice, even though we know they cannot give us orders on matters for our discretion: conversation with them will bring home to us with unlessened force the fact that the decision is ours. Someone can achieve general respect for the advice he gives, and there may be contact between him and the wrongdoer as well as the injured. This is illustrated by Mr. Gingell's case of the penitent son, who has brought injury on others while disobeying his father's instructions. He doubts whether some of the injured will forgive. His father says 'The important thing is that I forgive you', thus appearing a monster of egot- ism. But he may sound less monstrous if he says 'You have done all you could be asked so as to make amends: now you should not torment your- self so much'. This may be the right thing to say, and if he has acquired and deserved his son's respect it may be important that it is he who says it. Such informal advice is most often valued, not because it can be supported by demonstrative arguments or appeal to uncontroversial first principles-which usually it cannot-but because of our respect for the person who offers it. Coming from someone known to be over- indulgent it would be little regarded. If the father helps conquer his son's remorse, his words share some of the effects of forgiveness. But is there reason to say that the son is now forgiven, rather than just relieved? Yes, since in some circumstances the discretion to forgive granted by the moral system may, under the same system, lapse. Thus the unreasonably embittered man finds in the end that no one cares what he thinks, and that, even if he now wishes, he cannot take part in the sort of act of forgiveness that was at first open to him: by now it is he who is in the wrong. The best available representa-</page><page sequence="3">FORGIVENESS 115 tives of the moral system, like the father in the story or the social group in common fact, take over the right to rehabilitate the wrongdoer. We may now permit the injured to be bypassed, since his is not now de- served hostility: it is this feature of our moral system which is indicated by the use of the word 'forgive' for certain acts of external authority. And this feature of our moral system is a natural consequence of the fact that discretion can be genuinely granted, yet expected-as is normal with political discretions-to be used with some regard for certain ideals. The right of individuals to represent the ideal is not conceded too often. This is because the authority of any social agent must be very questionable. If he is disinterested, he may be too detached and unsym- pathetic; if he is involved, he may find his judgment unbalanced. And he may be misinformed. So clear superiority of wisdom over those in- volved is hard to establish, unless they show some especially deep degree of folly or unreason. Only with God is there an answer to all these doubts. God cannot be misinformed, and more important, he personi- fies both personal involvement in love and the most high and disinterested justice. Jesus, my fellow-man and friend, stands for the former ideal. The latter is represented in the Old Testament by the God whose face man cannot see and live, and who surrounds himself always-most memorably when giving his Law-with fires and storms, the symbols of punishment and destruction; in the New Testament by the God who is so far untouchable and unswayable by personal feeling for us that he must punish the world's disobedience to the Law by the world's total destruction, except insofar as mercy is gained by a Mediator who offers himself for destruction in man's place. To say that Jesus is God is to unite these two ideals. The union seems to contain irretrievable contradiction, but is just what we need if we are to guard God's authority against all criticism. If God's forgiveness seems too much like indulgence, we are to think of his transcendent justice; if God in his transcendence seems too forbidding and remote, then we are to think of his universal love. Only so can the penitent and the outcast be assured of hope when others, including those he has injured, spurn him. For God, as the ideal moral agent, always has the right to declare that they have abused their discretion, and that he forgives in their default. If Christians use the same verbal form for human and divine trans- actions, when the rules governing usage cannot be exactly the same in both cases, this to me is a fact to be explained. To Mr. Gingell, it means that one usage enshrines a mistake. But such 'double usage' is not the same as contradiction: it simply tells us that certain connections are habitually made. The connections here are between the ideas of real and of ideal moral agency, and they reflect the fact that Christianity under- stands what kind of ideal authority can bring peace of mind to the</page><page sequence="4">16 ANALYSIS wrongdoer-not badly, but all too well. The fault is in the Christian idea of God, not of forgiveness. The double usage suggests that man is like God, enough for imitation. This suggests in turn that it is worth a man's while to hold up as an ideal to himself an image of all the characteristics he would need in order to take certain decisions well. Two points arise here from the Euthyphro problem, to which Mr. Gingell aptly refers. First, the acceptance of such an ideal image is not necessarily either an act of self-enslavement or a furtive attempt at self-worship through the fiction of a Master's Voice which is really one's own echo. If someone has a loyalty or commitment to an authority-that of a group or that of a single person-we do not necessarily have any reason against accepting this as an expression of autonomous morality: indeed any kind of moral life lacking all such commitment seems unimaginable. On the other hand, when someone refers to the characteristics needed to take decisions well, he need not mean 'to take them as I would take them' or even 'in some way I could specify': otherwise, the common experience of recognizing the limitations of one's own judgment without being certain how to improve it, and of recognizing another's judgment as superior, could not occur. This commendation by respect is logically distinct from immediate com- mendation: one may follow the other judgment even though well aware of a personal and immediate judgment of the situation which is quite contrary. This is commitment not enslavement, because it is clearly a form, not a negation, of personal and autonomous choice; it is self- discipline not self-worship, because the other judgment plays a non- redundant part. Accordingly, both propositions offered by Socrates to Euthyphro may be asserted: the Gods command what is good (as good is recognized by my autonomous judgment) because it is good, and yet I may reasonably think something good because they command it. In other words, I commend the Gods by respect and I sometimes prefer the judgment arising from this commendation to that arising from imme- diate commendations or opinions in certain situations. A moral exem- plar must be comparable to me, only much better, and so my God is in my image, an idealized self the thought of whom sometimes has influence on my real unideal self. So. when an offence is committed, it outrages the morality I should, ideally, cherish: if I am a religious man, I must say it outrages my God, and I am only being consistent if I add that the for- giveness of God is what, above all, the wrongdoer needs. For, to me, all that is of most moral importance in matters of forgiveness is bound up with the readiness of all conerned to use their discretion, maybe con- trary to their immediate opinions, in accordance with a certain ideal. Hence the second point, which is that, when it comes to moral assess- ment of these religious ideals, the fictions and contradictions which often inhere in them need not much distress us. The commendation of</page><page sequence="5">FORGIVENESS 117 an ideal of forgiveness is a form of advice in a discretionary matter, and such advice must, by my previous argument, be informal. Here myths come into their own. Myths usually contain fiction and contradiction, but still serve their purpose, which is to give to a certain kind of under- standing-here moral-such articulation as it will bear, and still have importance, which is in fostering certain kinds of action. Euthyphro was bad at rational argument, but could still use his anthropomorphic fictions to arrive, for good or ill, at an unconventional moral certainty. The Christian view of the all-forgiving God is on my account contradictory, but has promoted, for good not ill, mercy and forgiveness among men- at any rate on the level of informal personal morality where religion belongs. Plato thought that myths were only for minds in tutelage, and could always in the end be replaced by rational understanding of the good. My argument has been that in matters of discretion strictly rational morality fails; if rational theology is drawn in, it fails likewise. The consequent recourse to myths, even if they are myths of a divine lawgiver who seems, happily to the penitent or ineptly to the philosopher, to pre-empt our proper discretion, is really an acknowledgment of these failures and hence of our discretion. But it is also the best way of reminding us of certain ideals, which illustrate excellence in the use of discretion, and hence intimate what abuse would be. So they may also remind us that discretion, if abused, can be discredited or lost. University of Newcastle upon Tyne ? MARTIN HUGHES 1975</page></plain_text>
