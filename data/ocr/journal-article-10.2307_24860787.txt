<plain_text><page sequence="1">Maenius absentem Novium cum carperet (Horace, Satires 1.3.21): Characters, Places, Monuments by Claudia Conese In this paper I propose to explore the relations between two well-known monuments in the Roman Forum, the Columna Maenia and the Marsyas, starting with a passage from Horace's Satires 1.3, 21-3. As is known, the two monuments are closely associated with the Republican history of Rome, and it is worth tracing these links briefly before moving on to a more in-depth consideration in relation to Horace. Let us begin with the Marsyas. The presence of a statue of the silenus in the Roman Forum is attested by relatively late literary sources with respect to the period in which it is believed to have been placed in the Comitium. The first literary source that makes explicit reference to Marsyas is a line in Horace, Sat. 1.6.119-21, where the poet lists the advantages of a simple and free life like his own, well away from high public posts and from the luxury of the ancient Roman nobility. deinde eo dormitum, non sollicitus, mihi quod eras surgendum sit mane, obeundus Marsya, qui se voltum ferre negat Noviorum posse minoris.' The first archaeological testimony to the statue is the so-called Marsyas of Paestum, a colonial copy of a Roman original which Coarelli dates 'with great probability to within the first half of 1 'Then I go off to bed, not worried at having to get up early tomorrow or having to appear before Marsyas, who declares that he can't stand the sight of the younger Novius' face.' Translated by P. Michael Brown.</page><page sequence="2">34 Claudia Conese the 3rd century BC',2 rejecting the dating to the Sullan age that had previously been accepted by historians.3 Observing the statue (fig. 1), we can note that the iconographie characteristics are quite different from those of Marsyas in the myth: nothing recalls the torment inflicted on the satyr by Apollo for having dared to challenge the god in the art of music, nor the episode in which he picks up the flute that the goddess Athena had cast aside after seeing her beautiful face pulled out of shape by the act of blowing into the instrument. The Marsyas has a raised right arm, a wineskin over the left one, a pileus or diadem (the front strip is clearly visible on the Paestum exemplar) and swollen ankles. The complete figure of the Forum Marsyas is represented on the denarius of the triumvir monetalis L. Marcius Censorinus, dating to the Sullan age (fig. 2), which depicts the two monuments referred to here, the Marsyas, in the foreground, and a small-scale Columna Maenia in the background. Starting with the lines from Horace, we can build up a precise history of the monument, outlining, over and above the purely historical and archaeological data, some anthropological and literary aspects. Even from a first reading of lines 119-21 of Sat. 1.6, it is clear that the Marsyas was not a marginal landmark in the topography of the Forum: as can be seen in the plan in figure 3, it was situated in a politically and socially significant zone of the Forum, that is, on the boundary between the Comitium and the beginning of the Forum. Traces of the importance of the statue in the life of the Forum and its relation to faenus can be found in Roman literature: for example, in Sped. 2.64.8 Martial describes the silenus as Marsya causidicus. But in Horace, as we shall see shortly, going to the Marsyas early in the morning, surgendum 2 Coarelli 1985, 97. J A dating to the 1st century BC was accepted by Piganiol 1944; Kahrstedt 1959; Tibiletti 1962. The (correct) dating to the 3rd century BC can be found in Bianchi Bandinelli and Giuliano 1973 and Bianchi Bandinelli 1982, who rightly associate the statue with the foundation of the colony.</page><page sequence="3">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 35 mane sollicitus, does not allude to an unspecified legal activity, but to the particular activity associated with questions offaenus and of indebtedness. It is not therefore possible to say, as Fedeli does, 'that going to the statue of Marsyas means, then, going to the Forum, in this case to make deals or to go to the court'.4 In Horace, the citation is not a metonymy to denote the Forum, but refers quite consciously to the well- circumscribed area of the Forum where trials or legal proceedings connected to the not inconsiderable social problem of usury took place. We need therefore to look more closely at the real significance of the statue, and on the basis of this, to see what interpretation Horace offers in relation to the figure of Novius. The Marsyas of Paestum is fundamental for defining the terminus ante quem for the chronology of the statue, which must already have been in Rome in the 3rd century B.C. The habit of placing a Marsyas in the colonies is testified not only by the Paestum find, but also by the commentary of Servius Danielis adAen. 4.58 Patrique Lyaeo: qui, ut supra diximus, apte urbibus libertatis est deus; unde etiam Marsyas, eius minister, est in civitatibus inforo positus, libertatis indicium, qui erecta manu testatur nihil urbi deesse? Efforts have been made to interpret the meaning of the term libertas in relation to the Marsyas. First of all, the libertas of which Marsyas is a symbol is closely bound up with the relationship between the silenus and Dionysus, the wineskin being a distinctive attribute in the Forum exemplar. Servius himself confirms that the Marsyas is indicium libertatis in that he is the minister of Liber. It is also true, however, that Servius was commenting on the Aeneid in a period in which the original 4 Fedeli 1994, ad loc. 5 'As we said before, he is rightfully the god of civic liberty: hence Marsyas, his minister, is placed in the Forum in various cities as a sign of liberty, and his raised hand demonstrates that the city lacks nothing.' (Except where indicated, all translations are the author's own.)</page><page sequence="4">36 Claudia Conese meaning of libertas associated with the statue of Marsyas might easily have been lost. Considering the well-known attitude of Rome in the first centuries of the res publica towards everything that came from the eastern world, it is highly implausible that the statue of a silenus would be situated in the most symbolic place of Roman political life simply because of the connection with the Dionysiac cult. It is evident that the libertas symbolised by Marsyas originally would not have been linked strictly to Dionysus. This does not rule out that the statue might have been the symbol of different types of libertas and that it held various meanings throughout antiquity, differently understood over time and space, but equally legitimate. If one considers the history of Rome in the 4th century BC, the period, as noted above, to which the genesis of the statue must be related, both the original significance to be attributed to the Marsyas and the reason why it was placed in a strategic location like the Forum become evident. According to Coarelli, 'the key document for establishing the moment and occasion in which the statue was produced is the Republican coin of L. Marcius. As Mario Torelli'' has already demonstrated, the choice of the triumvir monetalis can only be explained by way of a very close relationship with the person who erected the monument'. This must be taken as the point of departure for determining the meaning of the Marsyas and why it was used precisely from this period on as the symbol of Rome and of libertas. The gens Marcia, of plebeian extraction, is of great importance in Rome's history, and boasted as many as twenty one consulships in the period through to the late Republican age. C. Marcius Rutilus was the first member of this family to become consul, in 357 BC, a significant event in the political and social life of the Republic, as it marked the rise to the consulship of families of plebeian extraction. As reported by 6 Torelli 1982, 89-118, especially 98-106. Coarelli 1985, 111-13.</page><page sequence="5">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 37 Livy 7.17.9, the following year saw the first plebeian dictator. It is significant that one of the key points of the political programme of C. Marcius Rutilus was the fight against debt, which in those years had become a genuine social plague in Rome. There were many debtors, and often their debts were so high that they were unable to pay them off: in fact, many were reduced to slavery for debt, especially amongst the plebs. The son of C. Marcius Rutilus continued his father's pro-popular policy, getting a series of laws approved in favour of the plebs, such as that of 311, which made provision for sixteen tribuni militum. C. Marcius Rutilus iunior was censor in 294 and in 265 BC. It was an extraordinary and never subsequently repeated occurrence in the history of Rome for the same person to occupy the post of censor twice in his lifetime, hence the cognomen Censorinus.8 It is to this character that Torelli attributes the initiative of the Marsyas statue in the Forum, when he was censor for the first time in 294.9 It is possible, however, that the date when the statue was erected in the Forum can be pushed back by seventeen years, to the time of the lex Marcia (see infra), without this upsetting the chronology established by the find in Paestum. The problem of indebtedness was a 'modern' problem for Rome in the 4th century BC, a new social issue. It arose, according to Zehnacker,10 due to the new Italic and Magna Graecian trading market, which changed the archaic Roman society centring on the small farmer and based on an agro-pastoral economy into a more modern urban one based on an economy of exchange. The rise in interest rates was not only not curbed by the harsh and repressive systems of archaic law, but actually aggravated. The Twelve Tables (Gellius 20.1.45) envisaged the following punishment for insolvent debtors: 8 REXVI 2 col. 1558-9 'Marcius' 97 (MÃ¼nzer). 9 Torelli 1982. 10 Zehnacker 1980.</page><page sequence="6">38 Claudia Conese aeris confessi rebusque iure iudicatis triginta dies iusti sunto. post deinde manus iniectio esto, in ius ducito. ni iudicatum facit aut quis endo eo in iure vindicit, secum ducito, vincito aut nervo aut compedibus. quindecim pondo ne minore aut si volet maiore vincito." From 357 onwards the problem of indebtedness was addressed with new proposals for laws, and the limit of the faenus unciarium provided for by the Twelve Tables was reconfirmed, as Livy 7.16.1 reports: haud aeque laeta patribus insequenti anno C. Marcio Cn. Manlio consulibus de unciario fenore a M. Duillio L. Menenio tribunis plebis rogatio est perlata; et plebs aliquanto earn cupidius scivit.12 In 347 the interest rate was halved (Liv. 7.27.3-4): idem otium domi forisque mansit T. Manlio Torquato C. Plautio consulibus. semunciarium tantum ex unciario fenus factum, et in pensiones aequas triennii, ita ut quarta praesens esset, solutio aeris alieni dispensata est: et sic quoque parte plebis adfecta fides tamen publica privatis difficultatibus potior...13 In 342, when social tension was at its height, the faenus was abolished by the lex Genucia de feneratione. The statue of 11 'When a debt has been acknowledged and a judgment pronounced, 30 days must be the legitimate grace period. Thereafter, the debtor will be arrested and brought for judgment. If he does not satisfy what is imposed by the judgment, or no one offers surety on his behalf, the creditor may take the debtor with him. He may bind him either in stocks or fetters, with a weight of no less than 15 lbs. or more if he desires.' 12 'The bill about the interest rate was introduced the following year during the consulship of Gaius Marcius and Gnaeus Manlius by the tribunes of the plebs Marcus Duillius and Lucius Menenius. This was not so well received by the patricians, while the plebs accepted it with greater favour.' 13 'The same peaceful conditions continued at home and abroad during the consulship of Titus Manlius Torquatus and Gaius Plautius. The rate of interest, which had been one per cent, was halved, while the payment of debts was organized in such a way that one quarter was to be paid immediately and the rest in three-yearly installments. Even so, some sections of the plebeians suffered, but the senate could not give as much attention to individual cases as to public credit.'</page><page sequence="7">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 39 Marsyas, in all likelihood dating from after this period, as has already been noted, must in all probability be tied in with such events: first, its location in the Comitium was closely associated with the question of faenus. It would have been flanked, in the Forum, by the Aedicula Concordiae (erected by Cn. Fabius in 304 BC to seal the concord between the patricians and the plebs after the patrician-plebeian conflicts), the Tribunal and the Columna Maenia, the place where debitores a creditoribus proscribebantur.H The symbols that the Roman Forum Marsyas bears are closely related to this social history of Rome.15 There is mention of a lex Marcia adversus feneratores in Gaius, Institutiones 4.23: lex Marcia adversus faeneratores, ut si usuras exegissent, de his reddendis per manus iniectionem cum eis ageretur.16 The relation between the lex Marcia and the manus iniectio is clear. The legis actio per manus iniectionem envisaged, in its original form, the summoning of the debtor and the creditor before a judge. In the trial per manus iniectionem the debtor was at a clear disadvantage: the only way of halting judgement was to call a vindex to aid him by demonstrating that the creditor's claims were unfounded. Failure of the vindex to appear would lead to the debtor becoming addictus. The Lex Marcia adversus feneratores made provision, then, for the trial by manus iniectio Schol. Bob. in Cic. Sest. 8.18: dicit factum Gabinium superbiorem illo praecipue, quod esset aere aliÃ©na defaeneratus. et utitur ambiguis locorum nominibus: nam puteal vocabatur locus in vicinia fori, ubi erat columna etiam Maenia, apud quam debitores a creditoribusproscribebantur (see infra). 15 The thesis advanced by Small 1982, whereby the Marsyas of the Forum is the rex Lydorum who came from the East to teach the art of haruspicy opens up other possibilities: the connection between Marsyas and the gens Marcia will undoubtedly be dependent on the fact that the gens included, among its ancestors, the legendary vates Marcius of the Sibylline Books, but this would not have been the only reason for the placing of the statue of a Marsyas in the Forum. 16 'Lex Marcia against money-lenders, whereby if they demanded interest, the proceeding of the rnanus iniectio would be used against them to obtain a refund.' See Coarelli 1985, 105.</page><page sequence="8">40 Claudia Conese to be inflicted on usurers and not just on debtors: this law, clearly pro-plebeian in spirit and called the lex Marcia, was probably promulgated after the patrician-plebeian struggles, following the onset of the 'social issue' of indebtedness, chiefly concerning the plebs. If, then, this law is dated to after the 4th century BC, it is not unreasonable to argue that it was the work of C. Marcius Censorinus, tribune of the plebs in 311 BC, and bore his name. A measure of such social importance would probably have required an appropriate celebration: the statue of Marsyas might, then, represent the final product of the conflict between the patricians and the plebs, in which the weight of the debt problem was undoubtedly crucial. The Marsyas of the Forum appears to combine all the symbols of the constriction of slaves for debts: the compedes, clearly visible in the Paestum find, and the manus iniectio contra feneratores of the Marcian law (the raised right arm). Situated in the Forum in front of the Columna Maenia, the statue would have referenced clearly the government action involving executive measures against the problem of usury, which had limited the phenomenon whereby people were reduced to slavery for being indebted. Hence the idea of the statue as a symbol of libertas, described by later authors. The Imperial Age interpretation of the meaning of the statue as indicium libertatis, reported by Servius, would seem to derive from this ancient event and from this meaning of the person's libertas, more than from the broader and more universal Libertas. This meaning of Marsyas appears also in the Anaglypha of Trajan, where the silenus is reproduced at the right end of the slab depicting the destruction of the registers of debts. The motive that prompted the homonymous descendant of the Censorinus of the patrician-plebeian struggles, L. Marcius Censorinus, triumvir monetalis under Sulla, to produce coins bearing the effigy of the Marsyas erected by his ancestor, must be sought in the social situation during the Sullan age, when indebtedness became a problem again, acutely so after the end</page><page sequence="9">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 41 of the Social War.17 Presenting the Marsyas again would have conveyed a quite specific message in a period of economic difficulty and of renewed growth in the number of debtors. It is important, at this point, to look at the figure of Novius, named by Horace at Sat. 1.6.121. The mention of a minor Noviorum confirms the context relating to usury and indebtedness, as also emerges from the ancient commentaries of Pomponius Porphyrio and Pseudo-Acro. duo Novii fratres illo tempore fuerunt, quorum minor tumultuosus faenerator fuisse traditur. satyrice autem et eleganter hoc dictum quasi ideo manum levet Marsyas quod susdnere in Foro non possit hie Novium. obeundus autem Marsya quia in Foro vadimonium sistendum apud signum Marsyae sit.18 hi autem Novii fuerunt acerrimi feneratores et iocatur de hac re Horatius. ideo ait: puto Marsyam erectam unam manum habere, quod illorum feneratorum impudentiam non potest sustinere; deinde quod ad statuam Marsyae vadimonium statuebatur.19 Both commentators are in agreement in affirming the relationship between the Novii fratres and usury: the Marsyas, an acknowledged symbol of the fight against usury, clearly cannot bear the presence of a tumultuosus faenerator. There is no comic and deliberate misunderstanding of the gesture of the Marsyas in Horace: the irony, as often happens in the Satires, stems also in this case from an evident lack of proportion between the original meaning, often highly charged with historical, mythical and social overtones, and its attribution to 17 Frederiksen 1966, 54-8. 18 'There were at that time two brothers called Novius, the younger of whom was said to be a ruthless usurer. With irony and elegance, it is said that it is as if Marsyas raised his hand because he could no longer bear to see this Novius in the Forum. Obeundus is used in relation to the Marsyas, because one went to his statue to appear for trial.' 19 'These Novii were ruthless usurers; this is what Horace jokes about, and so he says: I think that Marsyas has a raised hand because he can no longer stand the brazenness of their usury; also because actions were brought near the statue of Marsyas.'</page><page sequence="10">42 Claudia Conese the 'popular' and 'degraded' context of Roman life. The question needs to be further investigated, extending it to the Columna Maenia. The column and the Marsyas in the Forum are close both spatially and ideologically. The presence of the column in the vicinity of the Marsyas is attested, as already noted, by the denarius of Censorinus (fig. 2). Brief reference to the history of the monument and its position in the Forum will help to better understand its relationship with the Marsyas and with the line from Horace that gives this paper its title. One of the main problems concerning the monument dealt with in the first monographic treatment of the Columna Maenia is the discordance between two authoritative ancient sources. As Osann observes,20 'proficiscendum in tota hac questione a duobus locis, uno Livii, antiquissimi eius rei testis, altero Plinii'.21 Pliny offers some very precise chronological information, thanks to which it is possible to identify the Maenius to whom the column is attributed: C. Maenius, consul in 338 BC with L. Furius Camillus,22 who defeated the Latins. The cursus bonorum of this character, belonging to a gens of plebeian extraction, was undoubtedly one of the most noteworthy in Rome's history: having defeated the naval coalition of the Latins he displayed the beaks of captured enemy galleys in the Forum and received a triumph with his colleague; he was censor in 318 and held the post of dictator twice, in 320 and in 314 on the occasion of the Second Samnite War. After his victory over the Latins, a column was dedicated to him, as Pliny reports, which thus became known as the 'Columna Maenia'. non vetus bigarum celebratio in his, qui praetura functi curru vecti essent per Circum. antiquior columnarum, sicut C. Maenio, qui 20 Osann 1844. 21 'The starting-point of this whole enquiry must be two quotations, one from Livy, our earliest witness on this subject, and the other from Pliny'. 22 RE, Maenius, col. 247.</page><page sequence="11">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 43 devicerat priscos Latinos, quibus ex foedere tertias praedae Romanus populus praestabat, eodemque in consulatu in suggestu nostra devictis Antiatibus fixerat anno Vrbis CCCCXVI. (Pliny, N.H. 34.20)23 Livy (8.13. 8-9) gives a historically more detailed account of events concerning the government of Rome in the years of the Latin war: placuit inde iam maiore conatu animoque ab unius expugnatione urbis ad perdomandum Latium victorem circumducere exercitum; nec quievere antequam expugnando aut in deditionem accipiendo singulas urbes Latium omne subegere. praesidiis inde dispositis per recepta oppida Romam ad destinatum omnium consensu triumphum decessere. additus triumpho honos ut statuae equestres eis, rara ilia aetate res, in foro ponerentur.24 The lack of any reference to the column in Livy, and the mention instead of an equestrian statue, also in the Forum, is undoubtedly puzzling, and raises a number of questions about the veracity of both sources. The divergence between these two authoritative testimonies has caused errors and interpretative problems not only in modern times,25 but also among ancient 23 'The custom of erecting memorial chariots with two horses in the case of those who held the office of praetor and had ridden round the Circus in a chariot is not an old one. That of statues on pillars is of earlier date, for instance the statue of honour of Gaius Maenius who had vanquished the Latins to whom the Roman nation gave by treaty a third part of the booty won from them. It was in the same consulship that the nation, after defeating the people of Antium, had fixed on the platform the beaked prows of ships taken in the victory over the people of Antium, in the 416th year of the city of Rome.' Translated by H. Rackham. 24 'The consuls then resolved, with the added energy and courage deriving from the capture of one city, that they would move with their victorious army to conquer Latium and that they would not stop until they had brought all Latium under their dominion, either by capturing or accepting the spontaneous submission of the cities. After setting up garrisons in the conquered cities, they returned to Rome to enjoy the triumph awarded to them by general consent. Moreover, equestrian statues were put up in the Forum in their honour, which was a rare thing for that age.' 25 Nineteenth-century criticism unanimously accepted (as Osann also did in his specialist work on the monument) the tradition of Pliny, and rejected that of later commentators. In an article written in 1938, K. Lehmann-Hartleben reopened the issue, claiming that the version offered by the scholiasts on Horace and Cicero was</page><page sequence="12">44 Claudia Conese commentators and authors. This is probably the origin of the other historiographie tradition regarding the column, which attributes the monument not to the Maenius who triumphed over the Latins but to a descendant of the same name who lived at the beginning of the 2nd century BC. He is said to have sold his house next to the Forum to Cato the Censor, the land being used to build the Basilica Porcia,26 and he retained the right to use the column in order to get a better view of the gladiatorial munera held in the Forum. I believe that this latter tradition should be regarded as an error on the part of ancient criticism, arising from the discrepancy between Pliny and Livy: it is no coincidence, in fact, that the only ones who report it are the ancient commentators on Horace and Cicero. In Porphyr, ad Hor. Servi. 1.3.21 we read: hie fertur domo sua, quam ad forum spectantem habuerat, divendita unam columnam inde sibi excepisse, unde gladiatores spectaret, quae ex eo Maeni columna nominabatur. cuius et Lucilius sic meminit: 'Maenius columnam cum peteret'.2 And in Pseudo-Asconius ad Cic. Divin. in Caecil. 16.50: Maenius cum domum suam venderet Catoni et Flacco censoribus, ut ibi basilica aedificaretur exceperat ius sibi unius columnae, super quam tectum proiceret ex provolantibus tabulatis, unde ipse et posteri eius spectare munus gladiatorium possent, quod etiam tum in Foro dabatur. ex illo igitur columna Maenia vocitata est.28 correct. According to this view, demolished by BoÃ«thius 1945 and Welin 1953, the Columna Maenia was a column of the Basilica Porcia, while ancient authors agree on the fact that it was an isolated monument. 26 Coarelli 1985, 42-5. 27 'Having putting his house up for sale, which overlooked the Forum, he is said to have kept for himself just a column, from which to watch the gladiatorial games. This is also recalled by Lucillius: "Maenius, when he went to the column. 28 'Maenius, in selling his house to the censors Cato and Flaccus so they could build the basilica, reserved the right to a single column; on it a platform was made</page><page sequence="13">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 45 The historical identification of the character clearly affects the chronology of the monument carrying his name: if credit were to be given to the tradition of the commentators, it would be two centuries later than the one described by Pliny. Another passage in Livy undoubtedly led Porphyrio and Pseudo-Asconius to the erroneous conclusion that the Columna Maenia was granted to a certain Maenius by Cato following the sale of his house: Cato atria duo, Maenium et Titium, in lautumiis, et quattuor tabernas in publicum emit basilicamque ibi fecit. (Liv. 39.44.7)29 Livy's text was clearly misinterpreted by the two commentators, who took atrium as a synonym of domus, the house Maenius supposedly sold to Cato. However, it can be affirmed, following Coarelli and Welin, that the term refers to atrium-shaped buildings used for public functions rather than as a house.30 The fact that Livy makes no reference to a column which might in some way relate to Maenius the censor poses a number of problems: from iconographie representations of the column,31 described by Coarelli (1983, 51) as 'visibly Tuscan and not Doric, given that it has a moulded base', there seems to be no doubt, despite the small size, that it was surmounted by an anthropomorphic figure that had little to do with an equestrian representation. If the equestrian statue was supported with protruding beams, from where he and his descendants could watch the gladiatorial games, which are still held in the Forum today. The Columna Maenia therefore takes its name from him.' 291 do not believe it is simply a coincidence that in the area near the Comitium, by the Latumiae (in other words, the Career) as Livy reports, there were two 'atria' belonging to plebeian gent es. Like the gens Maenia, the gens Titia was also of plebeian extraction. This is even more significant if one considers that near the Columna Maenia there must have been the statue of Marsyas, the 'plebeian' monument of the gens Marcia, also of plebeian origin. Probably in the 4th century BC, given that both the Marsyas and the Column can be dated to this period, the Forum area between the Comitium and the Career must have been the domain of the most prominent families of plebeian extraction. 30 Welin 1953, 179-217. 31 Above all, the denarius of Censorinus.</page><page sequence="14">46 Claudia Conese by a column, Livy would have reported it. Above all, a monument of this kind seems anachronistic for the age, given that we know that the first equestrian statue on a pilaster (and not, note, on a column) was of L. Aemilius Paullus, in Delphi, in a Greek rather than an Italic or Roman context.32 If, furthermore, one were to accept the idea that the statue of Maenius on horseback was on a column, the total silence about the statue of Furius Camillus would be inexplicable. Given that Maenius and Camillus had won the victory over the Latins together, it would be logical to deduce, as Livy himself states, that the two statues were placed together in the Forum. As can be noted from the denarius of Censorinus, the figurine on the top of the capital seems instead to represent an image of Victory13 or Minerva.34 The most likely possibility is that it depicted a Victory, if we accept the idea that the column was erected to celebrate, together with the equestrian statues, the victory of C. Maenius over the Latins. We cannot be certain, however, that the column was built with public funds and at the wishes of the 'state'. The 'public' decision to celebrate the two victorious consuls might just have concerned the equestrian statues and the triumph: it seems fairly likely that, as with the Marsyas statue, also placed on a column, the Columna Maenia could have been a private monument of the gens Maenia, created by the family to celebrate not just the victory of its most prominent member, but also the political posts he had held. It also cannot be ruled out that the construction was commissioned by Maenius himself when he was censor in 318, just as C. Marcius Censorinus commissioned the Marsyas around 311 BC. The existence of two different monuments dedicated to the same figure, one of which was a public commission (the equestrian statue) and the other private (the column), would explain the absence of any mention of the column in Livy, and also the lack 32 KÃ¤hler 1965. 33 Crawford 1974, 378; Kapossy 1965, 100. 34 Torelli 1982, 117; 1999 'Columna Maenia'.</page><page sequence="15">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 47 of reference to the equestrian statues in Pliny; in this latter case, though, the omission is less serious, because the author cites the column not in relation to the heroic deeds of Maenius, as Livy does, but as an example of a more ancient celebratio columnarum. For this reason, it was not necessary to make a link with the equestrian statue. Imagining different clients for the works could be a plausible solution to the problem of the discrepancy in the sources. Welin35 noted the homogeneity of the passages of Porphyrio and Pseudo-Asconius: it is not hard to accept that they derived from the same source, unknown to us, who appears not to have known about the passage in Pliny. It is unacceptable, however, to sustain that such a tradition was based on concrete evidence, nor is it possible to reconcile the two traditions regarding the column by thinking that they were both real, as claimed by BoÃ«thius, who hypothesised the existence of two Columnae Maeniae, that of the consul of 338 BC and that of the Maenius of the 2nd century BC associated with the Basilica Porcia and with Cato the Censor.36 The relation between the Columna Maenia and the Maenius of the 4th century BC is even more decisive if the building of the column is viewed in the context of the reorganisation of the whole Forum area by C. Maenius during his censorship in 318 BC. It is a by no means unimportant detail that both the gens Maenia and the gens Marcia were of plebeian extraction, and that they could boast members in the highest government posts in a period, the 4th century, in which the conflict between patricians and plebs was particularly acute. In addition, the erroneous attribution of the Maeniana, wooden stages used by the public to watch gladiatorial spectacles in the Forum, not to Maenius the censor but to the Maenius of the 2nd century, can certainly be linked to the belief that the latter had retained a column of his own house in order to watch the 35 Welin 1955, 9ff. 36 BoÃ«thius 1945, 89-110.</page><page sequence="16">48 Claudia Conese Forum shows with greater ease, as is reported respectively by Porphyrio adHor.

The characteristics of this 2nd-century Maenius, an impoverished aristocrat reduced to selling his own house, whose only interest was to hang on to the use of a 'column' so as to get a better view of the gladiatorial games, are wholly similar to those of the Maenius described by Horace in Epist. 1.15.26-32: Maenius, ut rebus maternis atque paternis fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi, scurra vagus, non qui certum praesepe teneret, inpransus non qui civem dignosceret hoste, quaelibet in quemvis opprobria fingere saevus, pernicies et tempestas barathrumque macelli, quidquid quaesierat ventri donabat avaro.37 The Maenius described here by Horace as a mean, vulgar figure who squandered both his father's and his mother's inheritance tallies with the report of the sale of the atrium Maenium given not only by Porphyrio and Pseudo-Acro, but also by Livy 39.44.7. In citing this Maenius, the squanderer and dissipater of his paternal inheritance, Horace was probably following a comic satirical vein already traced by Plautus and Lucilius, who cites a Maenius in the fragment [Maenius] columnam cum peteret (inc. 1203 Marx = Porphyr, ad Hor. Serm. 1.3.21, cited above). Maenius is characterised as a scurra, a characteristic figure in Plautine comedy, which Horace clearly draws on in w. 28-30 of Epistle 1.15 (fortiter absumptis urbanus coepit haberi, \ scurra vagus, non qui certum praesepe teneret, | inpransus non qui civem dignosceret hoste), where the combination of urbanus and scurra 3 'Maenius, having manfully spent all his mother and father left him, began as a vagrant urban scrounger, a creature with no permanent stable, when dinnerless not distinguishing friend from foe, who'd savagely fabricate lies about anyone, a tempest, a vortex, the food-market's ruin: whatever he found he gave to his greedy gut.' Translated by A. S. Kline.</page><page sequence="17">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 49 seems to depend directly on the iunctura of Mostellaria 1.1.14: tu urbanus vero scurra, deliciae popli rus mihi tu obiectas? sane hoc, credo, Tranio, quod te in pistrinum scis actutum tradier.38 The periurus, stolidus, mendaciloquus nature of the Plautine scurra fits well with Horace's Maenius, both the one in Epist. 1.15 and that of Sat. 1.3.21, where we read: Maenius absentem Novium cum carperet, 'heus tu' quidam ait 'ignoras te an ut ignotum dare nobis verba putas?' 'egomet mi ignosco' Maenius inquit. stultus et inprobus hic amor est dignusque notari. cum tua pervideas oculis mala lippus inunctis, cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius?39 Here, too, the description of Maenius closely resembles the characteristics of the scurra-. 'speaking ill' of his 'friend' behind his back, as Maenius does with Novius, is typical of the scurra, as can be noted in other passages from Horace where such characters all share the same trait; so, for example, Sat. 1.4.81-5: absentem qui rodit, amicum qui non defendit alio culpante, solutos qui captat risus hominum famamque dicacis, fingere qui non visa potest, conmissa tacere qui nequit: hic niger est, hune tu, Romane, caveto.40 38 'Indeed, you town wit, you minion of the mob, do you throw the country in my teeth? Really, Tranio, I do believe that you feel sure that before long you'll be handed over to the mill.' Translated by H.T. Riley. 39 'When Maenius once savaged absent Novius, someone said: "Look at yourself, or do you think to pretend, we can't see you too?" He answered: "Oh, myself I pardon." Such stupid and shameless self-love deserves to be censured. When we consider our own faults, we accidentally blind our eyes with a smear of ointment, but viewing our friends' we're as keen-eyed as eagles or Epidaurian snakes.' Translated by A. S. Kline.</page><page sequence="18">50 Claudia Conese Very probably this character, a descendant, judging from the name, of the gens Maenia that had produced prominent figures like the Maenius who had defeated the Latins, had become a parasite by profession after having squandered, fortiter, his family's assets. The ironic use of fortiter in Epist. 1.15.29 suggests that Maenius had accomplished the far from easy feat of wasting the sizeable patrimony of his family, and that Horace wanted somehow to employ, in a low and unheroic context, an adjective which, with its positive meaning, was well suited to describing the glorious deeds of the young Maenius' ancestor. But a fundamental point for understanding the character of the figure and his relation with the monument of the same name is his relationship with Novius. It has been seen that a 'family' trait of the Novii was that they were acerrimifeneratores, as Pseudo-Acro comments ad Serm. 1.6.116. The fact that Maenius and Novius are placed alongside each other in Sat. 1.3.21, almost like a pair of scurrae, is not insignificant: Novius is, to use Porphyrio's words, an acerrimus fenerator, while Maenius is so heavily in debt that he has become a scurra, preserving only the high-sounding name of the gens. The oxymoronic association of a usurer and a debtor is particularly effective for the irony of the verse. Commenting on Sat. 1.3.21, Porphyrio refers clearly to Maenius' indebtedness (see the technical reference to the kalendae, days on which payment of debts was due): qui de personis horatianis scripserunt, aiunt Maenium et scurrulitate et nepotatu notissimum Romae fuisse, hic cum post patrimonium adrosum kalendis Ianuariis in Capitolio clara voce optaret ut quadrigenta milia nummorum aeris alieni haberet (...).41 40 'He who besmears a friend behind his back, who does not defend him when he is attacked, who goes in search of a hearty laugh and a reputation for being a wit, who is capable of inventing what he hasn't seen, who is unable to maintain silence about what has been confided in him: citizen of Rome, beware of such black souls.' Translated by A. S. Kline. 41 'Those who wrote about Horatian characters say that Maenius was well known in Rome as a spendthrift and a squanderer. This man, after he had gnawed his heritage, wished aloud in the Capitol on the calends of January for a loan of 400 000</page><page sequence="19">Horace, Satires 1.3.21 51 We know from the Scholia Bobiensia ad Cic. Pro Sest. 8.18 that the Columna Maenia area was frequented by insolvent debtors, against whom trials were held: dicit factum Gabinium superbiorem illo praecipue, quod esset aere alieno defaeneratus. et utitur ambiguis locorum nominibus: nam puteal vocabatur locus in vicinia fori, ubi erat columna etiam Maenia, apud quam debitores a creditoribus proscribebantur.42 Horace's verse Maenius absentem Novium cum carperet almost becomes the personification of the relationship between the Columna Maenia and the Marsyas. The connection between Maenius and the column and between Novius and the Marsyas is clear: Novius is a faenerator and the Marsyas, which had great importance in the fight against the high interest rates of the usurers, can no longer bear his presence; Maenius is a debtor accustomed to going to the area around the column apud quam debitores a creditoribus proscribebantur. The proximity of the two monuments permits the establishment of a strong tie between the practices that took place around each, as is succinctly exemplified on the coin of Censorinus, where there was a clear intent to get the Columna Maenia onto the coin at all costs, albeit reduced in size. The connection between the Columna Maenia and Marsyas must have been so strongly felt in Horace's time that the association between the figures of Maenius and Novius sufficed to project the 'reader' of the satire not into an unspecified universe of mean and degraded 'comic' figures, but into the area of the Forum between the two monuments. Claudia Conese Universities of Pisa and Geneva sesterces.' 42 'Cicero says that Gabinius was elevated particularly because he had been freed from debt. He uses some uncertain names for places: Puteal was the name of a place in the Forum Romanum where also was the Columna Maenia, where debtors were pursued by creditors.'</page><page sequence="20">52 Claudia Conese Bibliography Anderson, J.
