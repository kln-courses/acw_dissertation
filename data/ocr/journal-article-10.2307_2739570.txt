Discussion: Only a brief account of discussion is given here; it is expected that a full ex- amination of arguments and conclu- sions will be published-probably by the journal Economic Development and Cultural Change in 1961. To some extent this conference built -as it was intended to-on the discus- sion and results of an earlier conference held in Chicago, which had dealt with problems of co-operation between econ- omists and anthropologists in the field of economic development (see report, 'Workshop in Economic Anthropology,' CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY, March, 1960, p. 149). Though the terms of reference of the second conference were narrower than those of the first-capital, saving and credit in peasant societies being its sub-heading-discussion turned fre- quently to fundamental questions of the feasibility and desirability of joint anthropological-economic research. Nevertheless, some specific fields of enquiry were explored, using material derived from the data papers and from the research of individual participants. These fields were defined as: (1) con- cepts of capital, saving and investment and their application to peasant socie- ties; (2) capital accumulation and social structure; (3) management of capital by agriculturalists, pastoralists, and trad- ers; (4) general problems of credit in Vol. 2. No. 2. April 1961 139</page><page sequence="2">peasant societies; and (5) types of sav- ing and investment. Some topics emerged repeatedly in different contexts, particularly what was implied by "peasant economy." It was agreed that "peasant" could not be equated only with rural or agricultural workers, and several dimensions of a possible definition were examined. Type of settlement, residence, and rela- tionship to the land; type of links of the "peasant" economy with town, city, and outside world, and the effect of complete or partial monetization were important, as was the fact that in a peasant society there are recognized roles that can be conceived of in eco- nomic terms only. Discussion of the problem of identifi- cation of capital in peasant societies led to categorization of major items of peas- ant capital in the form of houses, land (there is an argument in this context for setting aside the classic distinction be- tween land and capital), agricultural and other implements or equipment, domestic animals, jewelry, stocks (e.g. of grain and trade goods), cash (loans, etc.), rights which command services or yield income and social capital in the forms of roads, bridges, etc. The effect of small-scale production was relevant to many topics such as, for instance, the assessment or the cost of capital maintenance in societies with relatively low productivity. Some other topics discussed concerned the relation- ship of external political factors to the peasant economy, and their impact on opportunities open to entrepreneurs; the circumstances under which it might be necessary for an entrepreneur to break with his existing social network; the pressures operating against innova- tion in the use of capital; the effect of the burden of various rates of interest on loans in peasant societies; the advan- tages of sectoral analysis in examining the relationship between economy and other aspects of the social structure; and the way in which Western institutions (e.g., banks) may change when trans- planted to underdeveloped countries. Results: Discussion appeared to result in clari- fication, and in suggestion of some new ways of looking at material; on the whole it seemed to reinforce the convic- tion held by most participants that there was a very wide field, in the study of development, where economics and anthropology could profitably be brought together, by one worker with expertise in both disciplines, or by a team combining economists and anthro- pologists, or by the taking of opinion on specific topics where anthropologists and/or economists could be called in as outside advisers. In terms of practical beginnings, par- ticipants attempted to formulate, as hy- potheses or themes, notions that were implicit or explicit in discussion and papers presented. A few of the more self-explanatory of these are given here in the hope that they may be tested as they stand, or put forward in more test- able form, by those interested in the field. It seems possible that: (1) Where there is great differentia- tion in farm size and wealth, and where there is no governmental credit avail- able on favourable terms to the poorest peasants and where there are no outside sources of income, credit given by the rich peasants to the poor for the pur- pose of consumption: a) is the source of social control; b) preserves the small farms and also preserves labour forces; c) is a form of capital accumulation but does not affect existing social dif- ferentiation. (2) Where there is great differentia- tion in farm size and wealth, and where there is no governmental credit avail- able on favourable terms to the poorest peasants, and where there are outside sources of income available to the poor- est peasants, the rich peasants do not lend money to the poor (at least not from the same village). In consequence of which: a) the rich peasants invest money outside; b) the former cultural unity of the community disappears, the rich clinging to the traditional ways while the poor adopt the culture of the town; c) the rich lose social control over the poor, and the values on which tradi- tional leadership was based change; d) there is no change, however, in farm size and wealth. (3) In a society where kinship ties be- yond the immediate family do not nec- essarily involve obligation, the greater the gulf of wealth between lender and borrower and the higher the degree of integration of the rich peasant group, then the stricter is the execution of debts. (4) In these circumstances, rich farm- ers are concerned with lending money to medium-size farmers. Medium-size farmers borrow money from them until: a) government credit is made avail- able for them on favourable terms; b) social control by the rich peasants becomes less powerful; c) the group of poor peasants has the opportunity of getting income from outside sources; d) the rich group of peasants loses the labour resources of the poor both within and without the community. Possible themes for further investiga- tion concern: (1) The relationship between the rate of capital accumulation and the type of social differentiation in a peas- ant society; (2) The periodicity of income (i.e., regular or irregular and seasonal) and its relation to the case of capital ac- cumulation; (3) The possible effects of attempts to use traditional forms of co-operation to introduce new methods in agriculture (c.f., policy in some Communist coun- tries to attempt to destroy old forms and introduce new ones); (4) The ways in which rituals and ceremonies may be related to saving and consumption; (5) The differential effects of types of taxation on social structure and capital accumulation; (6) The possible limiting effects on the building-up of capital of segregated spheres of exchange in an economy; (7) The effects on the network of credit extension of different descent and residence systems, in the case of a large-scale market invasion of a terri- tory. The papers presented at the confer- ence will be collected and published as a volume edited by Raymond Firth and Basil Yamey, entitled Capital, Saving and Credit in Peasant Societies.

WITTEBORG Discussion: In this conference, museum directors and experts in commercial presentation and communication gathered to ex- change ideas and explore new avenues of museum presentation. Several broad areas were delineated for discussion by the group. The relationship of museum design to commercial design was the first of these areas to be taken up. After estab- lishing a groundwork of agreement on the purpose and function of museums, their influence on the industrial world and the various contributions museums can make to this wider public were dis- cussed. Other points that interested the conferees were: the contributions of museums to the ever-increasing leisure time of Americans, whether museums should be used as centers of entertain- ment and public education or as cen- ters of scholarly research, and the points of view of museum visitors. Visual communication was another broad area explored by conference members. Discussion of the techniques and design factors that contribute to a good exhibition program centered around subject matter, form and space, color, light, sound, and the written word. Ideas versus objects (or prod- ucts), the designing of meaningful and storytelling exhibits, and the usefulness of testing devices and visitor surveys in evaluating the effectiveness of display techniques, were other aspects of visual communication covered. Mutual assist- ance between companies and museums, and the value of public relations tech- niques were also considered. Results: The participants agreed that more meetings of this type would be useful, and that the points of view of persons who work on display and presentation problems outside the museum were most beneficial to the latter. The entire discussion was recorded on audio tapes, and will later be published. * Symposium on Comparative Aspects of Human Communication September 4-10, 1960, at Burg War- tenstein, Austria.

Discussion: Providing opportunities for discus- sion among specialists who share a com- mon interest in the study of communi- cation, the symposium brought together participants from the fields of linguis- tics, anthropology, phonetics, acoustics, zoology, neurology, psychiatry, and oto- laryngologic physio-pathology. Their diversity of orientation, terminology, and interests ensured a wide range of detailed information, although it did not always facilitate communication. All participants were especially in- terested in the communication systems of animals, including the "language" of bees, which was demonstrated to be more similar to human language than had previously been realized. Several participants advocated systematic stud- ies of the comparative aspects of animal communication systems, and the adop- tion of concepts which recognize the structural framework and function of the peripheral and central neuro- muscular phonation apparatus of the species. It was agreed that cautious avoidance of anthropomorphic view- points and a large amount of detailed study is needed to achieve a better un- derstanding of communication among animals, which may then be utilized for clarification of human communication. Major interdisciplinary definitions of the basic concepts in human communi- cation research were considered pre- mature; and the main achievement of the symposium was a tendency toward the synthesis of divergent viewpoints, which may later lead to a fruitful analy- sis of details and specific problems. Participants representing technical studies agreed that the fusion of multi- disciplinary viewpoints inspired by anthropological methods will lead to broader concepts of communication theory. At the last session, arrangements were made to publish the proceedings of the symposium in Logos, which will be made available to the anthropolog- ical audience. Since it is clearly im- practical to unite such divergent groups for the solution of specific problems, the informal organization of a perma- nent committee on comparative aspects of communication was moved. It was also voted that a specific meeting for the concrete and detailed planning of further studies should be convened by investigators who are interested in the systematic exploration of animal "lan- guage." Every partial solution of per- Vol. 2 No. 2 April 1961 141</page><page sequence="4">tinent problems is a step toward the goal of a better understanding of the essence of human communication and its phylogenetic evolution.

"From food collection to urbanization in India." Discussion: The purpose of the symposium was set forth in a preliminary letter of invitation sent to the participants in the fall of 1959. The symposium was to concern itself with the tracing of man's history from latest Pleistocene times up to the thres- hold of the urban civilizations. This was projected upon a world-wide basis, and was to deal, substantively, with those archeological evidences which re- veal the varying degrees of intensifica- tion of food-collecting; the transitions from food-collecting to partial or to fully effective food-production; and the eventual emergence of city life and civilization. The cultural consequences and accompaniments of these tran- sitions were to be examined closely. Inquiry was to be directed not only to those regions where urbanization first crystallized, but to more "peripheral" regions which may or may not have attained full urbanism. Attention was to be given to environ- mental adaptations under differing conditions, and to shifts in adaptations either before or following the appear- ance of food-production. The relative roles of environmental factors and migration and/or diffusion in the con- version of hunter-collector cultures to those of food production were also to be studied. Interest also centered upon the qualities and quantities of cultural intensifications immediately antecedent to the appearance of urban civilizations, analyzing the evidence for settlement patterns, population sizes and group- ings, long range trade, incipient "priest- hoods," "kingships," and the institution of warfare. In brief, the question was posed: What can the prehistoric arche- ologist contribute to the understanding of why urban civilizations came about when and where they did? As a working hypothesis, the deline- ations of an urban civilization given by Childe (Town Planning Review 21: 3-17, 1950), with Redfield's comments in The Primitive World and Its Trans- 142 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">formations (1953), were used. The goal of the symposium was not so much the definition of urban civilization as such- or a post facto analysis of its genesis' via "historic" materials-but rather a con- sideration of the varieties of cultural build-ups leading to the thresholds of urban civilizations. The organization of the symposium began with the preparation of the above series of background papers by the participants. These were statements bearing upon the archeology of par- ticular world areas with reference to the general theme of the symposium. All were relatively brief; none exceeded 10,000 words. These papers were then duplicated and circulated among all participants in advance of their arrival at Burg Wartenstein. The symposium opened with 31,2 days of panel discussions based upon the background papers. Discussion ranged over possiblities of generaliza- tions about culture change in widely separated world areas. "Ecologically" similar culture areas were examined, as well as areas which provided strong environmental contrasts. Similarly, "nu- clear" and "marginal" area develop- ments were explored for parallels and differences. A day of unprogrammed discussion followed, during which time five central questions were formulated: (1) In the late glacial and early post- glacial periods, what major cultural events characterize your area? By what archeological traces are these expressed? (2) Defining incipient cultivation (and/or animal domestication) as a minor or supplementary basis of total subsistence-when and how do such conditions appear? (3) At what point in the cultural sequence of your area do you feel that you can identify effective food pro- duction (plant cultivation and/or ani- mal domestication assuming a major subsistence role) and what are its arti- factual expressions and social (directly inferred) consequences? (4) Does effective food-production appear as part of an indigenous evolu- tion, or does it (as revealed archeolog- ically) suggest outside influences? To what extent does the appearance of effective food-production (either in- digenous or imported) seem explosive ("revolutionary")? (5) Could you use the term "thres- hold of urbanization" in your area? If so, what would you mean, and what is the evidence for its development? The remaining four working days of the symposium were devoted to the re- working and redrafting of the back- ground papers in the light of these "thematic" questions. This was done; but in its course many informal talks on all aspects of the symposium subject were held among members of the group. The final versions of the background papers, with an introduction and some concluding remarks by the editors, R. J. Braidwood and G. R. Willey, will be published in the near future, probably as a Viking Fund Publication in Anthropology. * Early Man and Pleistocene Stratig- raphy in the Circum-Mediterranean Regions July 14-20, 1960, at Burg Warten- stein, Austria.

Discussion: The greater part of the discussion concerned the nature and interpreta- tion of the marine and varied intercalated continental sediments com- prising the Pleistocene succession along the continental margins adjacent to the basin of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic littoral of Morocco. Notable evidence of the marine later Pliocene 'is provided by the Tyrrhenian, and especially the Adriatic, coasts of Italy. The Lower Pleistocene is repre- sented by superposed marine sediments of variable facies, sometimes contin- uous, and sometimes disconformable; these are the transgressive Calabrian (including the regressive Emilian) and the Sicilian stages. Where the ma- rine Calabrian is continuous (non- transgressive) with the Pliocene, the transition between Pliocene and Lower Pleistocene may be indicated by cli- matic oscillations. A major stage, surely complex and subdivisible on both stratigraphic and faunal grounds, which Vol. 2 * No. 2 * April 1961 143</page><page sequence="6">is termed the Milazzian (after the defi- nition by Deperet), and characterized by an indifferent invertebrate fauna, is of Middle Pleistocene age and is generally transgressive- on these sedi- ments. In the Northern Appennines near the Po Valley, intercalated conti- nental sediments with an early Abbevilleo-Acheulian industry are known. These earlier stages are over- lain, at places with erosional uncon- formity, by marine (Tyrrhenian complex) and continental sediments which evidently represent a consider ably shorter range of time. Such factors as subsidence (Po delta), orogeny, and vulcanism, which played distinctive roles in particular regions, often com plicate the interpretation and obscure the sequence of marine and continental sedimentation. In the Rome area, how ever, differences in times of volcanic activity and in eruptive products among particular groups of volcanoes have served as helpful markers in distinguish- ing various stages of marine and conti- nental sedimentation; some of these have been shown to be dateable by iso topic (potassium/argon) methods. Pa leontological and palynological studies afford some evidence of climatic changes during and subsequent to the continental Villafranchian. The Atlantic littoral of Morocco, an area which, though uplifted during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, remained un- deformed during the Pleistocene clearly provides one of the most com- plete Pleistocene successions in the world. At least five (and perhaps six) distinct marine cycles, designated ac- cording to a local terminology, have been distinguished, and are related to continental formations-often with mammalian fossils, and implement bearing-which extend from the earlies' Pleistocene (continental Villafran chian) through the final Pleistocene. An extraordinary succession of lithic industries is closely dated with refer ence to this sequence. It begins with four stages of the so-called "Pebble- Culture" (Pre-Chelles Acheul in sub Saharan Africa), the last of which is transitional to the oldest bifacial indus try. These are followed by eight dis tinct, and both technically and typologically changing, Acheulian in dustrial stages; succeeded in turn by a (perhaps) Mousterian of Acheulian facies, the Aterian industry of the latei Upper Pleistocene, and the end- anc post-Pleistocene-Ibero-Maurusian (Or anian) industry. Much discussion centered on the problem of the Tyrrhenian stage, it, subdivisions, and relative dating. Thiz stage is generally admitted to be corn plex, but has often been defined or grounds (e.g., altitudinal) other than the criterion in the original definition proposed by Issel, i.e., as a marine hori- zon characterized by a Senegalian-type fauna, especially Strombus bubonius. The horizon with an indifferent fauna that preceded the deposits with Strom- bus bubonius is sometimes referred to as the Tyrrhenian (= Paleotyrrhenien of E. Bonifay and P. Mars); it is clearly of Middle Pleistocene age, and some work- ers tend to regard it as contemporane- ous with (a part of) the Milazzian, which is known to be complex (multi- cyclic). Beaches and cliffs cut during the main Tyrrhenian stage, and littoral- and sometimes deeper-sediments of this stage, are widely represented in Spain and the Balearic Islands, south- ern France, the Tyrrhenian and south- ern Adriatic coasts of Italy, Corsica, Sicily, Lebanon, Israel, lower Egypt, Cyrenaica, Tunisia and Algeria. The problem is often complicated by the absence of Strombuts bubonius in cer- tain horizons and regions-in part at least as a consequence of ecological factors-where the stratigraphic evi- dence strongly favors reference to the Tyrrhenian stage. Comparable littoral formations, stratigraphically of the same relative age, are well developed along the Atlantic coast of Morocco; some slight differences in invertebrate faunas hinder direct comparison and correlation with the Tyrrhenian of the Mediterranean (although some hori- zons may be traced through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean basin). A number of well-known prehistoric occupation sites, generally caves or shelters, containing basal infillings of marine sediments of the Tyrrhenian stage, occur along the Tyrrhenian littoral of Italy (Monte Circeo, Apulia), at Gibraltar, and in the Lebanon. Their industries are broadly referable to the Mousterian complex, with both stratigraphic and regional subdivisions and facies. Radiocarbon determinations from occupation residues, either di- rectly from such sites, or from other continental sites with similar industries related to long successions of prehistoric occupation, already afford limiting ages for certain of the underlying Tyrrhen- ian accumulations. The older or Strombus horizon (Eutyrrhenien of E. Bonifay and P. Mars) is generally ac- cepted as being of the Last Inter- glacial age; whereas the younger horizon, situated at a lower altitude (Neotyrrhenien of E. Bonifay and P. Mars), is terminal Last Interglacial to earliest Last Glacial. The relation of the Ouljien horizon (M. Gigout) to either of these horizons in the Mediter- ranean is not yet absolutely certain. The widespread occurrence of these horizons, often continuous and un- deformed, over substantial stretches of the present Mediterranean littoral, and the accompanying sites of human oc- cupation, are facts of singular impor- tance for paleoanthropological as well as Pleistocene geological investigations. Results: Among the most important conse- quences of this conference was the free and continued exchange of empirical data and points of view among workers concerned with research on Pleistocene geology and paleoanthropology in the circum-Mediterranean regions. The na- ture and direction of future research will be greatly stimulated and guided by these discussions and by the useful background papers prepared by the participants. Important propositions upon which there was common agreement include the following: (1) In the Mediterranean basin and adjacent regions, orogenic deforma- tions, and particularly Epirogenic uplift, occurred throughout the Pleisto- cene. (2) Between the Sicilian and the Tyrrhenian (Strombus fauna) marine stages of the Mediterranean occur de- posits characterized by an indifferent fauna. (3) For reasons of priority (Dep6ret), this interval can be designated the Milazzian stage although it is not yet known to be represented at Milazzo. (4) It is important that further efforts be made to ascertain the stratig- raphy of the Milazzian and Tyrrhenian stages at Taranto. (5) Near present sea level there are at least two distinct marine horizons of which one represents a late phase of the Flandrian transgression (post- Glacial), and the other is older (ter- minal Last Interglacial to early Last Glacial). A more intensive program of radiocarbon dating should be under- taken to distinguish certain of these horizons which, in places, may be (and have been) confused because of their similar elevations. (6) Workers in the Mediterranean basin and adjacent littoral regions who are especially concerned with the study of the Milazzian and Tyrrhenian stages must have further opportunities to observe such formations in the various regions. The collected papers of the con- ference will be published together, probably in a special volume of Quaternaria, the journal devoted to Pleistocene geological and paleoanthro- pological studies, which was founded and edited by the late Professor A. C. Blanc, and will be dedicated to his memory. 144 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page></plain_text>
