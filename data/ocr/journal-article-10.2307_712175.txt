<plain_text><page sequence="1">224 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW S.C.'s main concern is with topography, establishing the existence and mapping the course of the road. She provides evidence to support the theory that the consular road between Puteoli and Nuceria ran through the plain to the south of Pompeii rather than through the town itself. She then offers her own theory that this road continued straight to Nuceria, crossing the Sarno at Scafati, rather than turning south to Stabiae: in other words, that her newly charted road is in fact the main Puteoli-Nuceria highway. It certainly continued in use after the eruption of A.D. 79, showing its importance as a route, and an inscription found at Scafati may suggest that the road and its bridge were repaired as a matter of urgency after the earthquake of 62. There is, moreover, no trace of another road coming up the river from Stabiae. The book concentrates on this narrow question, but it contains material with wider implications. Any new information on the hinterland of Pompeii is welcome, especially further evidence that some areas were occupied after the eruption. Above all, the study raises interesting questions about the relationship between Pompeii and Nuceria. S.C. notes, on the basis of different patterns of centuriation, that the Sarno marked the boundary between them, but there remains the question of which town had control over the bridge at Scafati. A cippus found there records the repair of the via Pontis et substructiones by two aediles, M. Antonius [...] and C. Cornelius Fuscus. Both the Antonii and the Cornelii are attested at Pompeii, and S.C. identifies the first man with M. Antonius Tertius, aedile in 62: the bridge was therefore clearly under Pompeian control, and must have been repaired almost immediately after the earthquake. This seems a little tenuous: we have no idea whether these families were not also to be found at Nuceria, and the milestone adjacent to the cippus does mark the distance from that town rather than from Pompeii. More significant for studies of relations between the two towns is the fact that, whatever their allegiance, the magistrates did not feel it necessary to record it on the inscription, although the bridge must have been an important point of interaction between the territories.

Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1996. $42.50. ISBN: 0-472-10571-X. This monograph gives a complete account of the architectural decoration of the Regia in the sixth century B.C., expanding D.'s account in E. Rystedt, C. Wikander, O. Wikander (edd.), Deliciae Fictiles (Stockholm, 1993) (rev. JRS 85 [1996], 285-6), a fundamental collection of articles on this craft. Hellenistic terracottas from the area are not included, since they belong to a separate building. This leaves the third and fourth phases of the Regia (c. 570 B.C. and the third quarter of the sixth century respectively). D.'s detailed and careful research allows her to distinguish a series of female head antefixes and a strigilated sima with panther's head spout (i.e. a covering for the eaves, which also acted as a gutter on the long sides of temples, to keep water away from the elaborate decoration at the top of the walls) as the sole remaining part of the fourth phase. Even this small amount of evidence can tell us that by this time the Regia stands clearly in the larger pattern of Central Italic architectural decoration, with standardized moulds and centres of production. The earlier third phase is more experimental. Various aspects can be related to other buildings at the Forum Boarium complex, or in Murlo and Acquarossa, but the frieze plaques which show felines, a bird, and a 'Minotaur' are uniquely Roman-these are assigned to a raking cornice and architrave in a pediment on the south side. D. also tentatively hypothesizes a ridge-pole with an anthropomorphic statue and vegetal acroteria, using Murlo and Acquarossa as guides. Quite how this rather axial roof system fits onto the non-axial ground plan of this complex and difficult building is not at all clear; a reconstruction drawing of elevations, however tentative, would have been useful in visualizing how the system would have worked. The presentation is clear; the two phases are taken separately, discussed type by type, with a general conclusion to each, followed by a catalogue and good plans and illustrations. There is a highly useful glossary of terms. One of D.'s great virtues is her careful and cautious explanation ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page><page sequence="2">225 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW of the possible significance of the friezes and other figures. Most have apotropaic significance, and the Minotaur, which has been squeezed hard for deeper meaning, she discusses very sensibly (pp. 9-30). This careful study undoubtedly makes a very significant contribution to our understanding both of the evolution of the motifs of architectural terracotta decoration in Central Italy, and of the development of the craft. The growing standardization of the later sixth century may be an important factor in assessing economic life at the end of a period of tremendous growth; does it suggest, for instance, that the demand for these terracottas had outstripped the capacity of a few exceptional craftsmen? What does this imply for the status of the artisans and their changing relationship with their patrons? This monograph does not attempt to explore these wider questions, and it naturally raises more questions than it answers. Since the Regia was not only part of the king's residence but also contained the sacella of Mars and Ops Consiva, does the decoration relate in any way? The fourth phase, if it followed the pattern of other friezes like S. Omobono, Velletri, Veii and Cerveteri, may well have had a procession, banquet, and assembly, with attendant status implications. A very minor point might be that the use of the Minotaur as one of the earliest legionary symbols (Pliny HN 10.16, cf. Festus 135L, quoted on p. 90) may be connected and may even have been derived from its presence on the Regia, with its Mars connection. Finally, D. does not engage at all with the complex issue of the relationship between the Regia and the Rex, so notably explored by Coarelli, and taken up recently by Cornell; what was the function of this building, and is it really like the buildings to which it is sometimes compared (e.g. Murlo, Acquarossa, and even an early house at Athens)? D.'s meticulous work will make it easier to engage with these tantalizing questions. University of St Andrews CHRISTOPHER SMITH D. PIKHAUS:Repertoire des inscriptions latines versifiees de l'Afrique romaine (Ier-VIe siecles) I, Tripolitaine, Byzacene, Afrique proconsulaire. (Epigraphica Bruxellensia, 2.) Pp. 162. Brussells: Epigraphica Bruxellensia, 1994. Paper, Belg. fr. 1,000. This is the first volume of an inventory of the verse inscriptions of Roman Africa. It is not the sort of book that one might be tempted to read from cover to cover, because only the first line of each inscription is cited, but it will prove indispensable for future editors of carmina epigraphica. The arrangement is by region (p. 24: 'Nous avons classe les carmina par site et les sites par ordre geographique a l'interieur des provinces'). For each site non-Christian inscriptions precede Christian, and inscriptions which were published by Biicheler-Lommatzsch precede those which were either missed in CLE or discovered after its appearance. It is a simple matter for the reader to identify new material (not all of which has yet been publishd: see T2, p. 30). There is a full bibliography attached to each inscription, with a description and background information sometimes reaching a page or two in length. An exemplary short introduction (about fourteen pages) contains (e.g.) a good deal of useful bibliography and a resume of the shortcomings of CLE. Carmina which are post-Biicheler now number about 1600, and many of those which Bucheler did include have since been re-edited. P. points out that Biicheler treated carmina epigraphica as literary texts rather than as inscriptions, classifying them by metre. This had the effect of obscuring their geographical distribution and possible significance as manifestations of regional culture. He included only a selection of Christian carmina. An unfortunate feature of CLE is that the prae- or subscriptum in prose which may accompany a verse inscription is not necessarily printed in full; yet it is often the part in prose which allows the poem to be dated (p. 19). The introduction also describes the criteria which have been used to establish what constitutes a carmen epigraphicum (pp. 22-3). There are finally comprehensive indexes running to about forty pages.
