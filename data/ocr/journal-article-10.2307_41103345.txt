McMillan ABSTRACT Most reconstructions of Nuu-chah-nulth culture history, including the generalized West Coast culture type, are based primarily on the lengthy cultural sequence known from Yuquot, at the entrance to Nootka Sound. More recent work further to the south has raised questions about past interpretations. Excavations at Ch'uumat'a, in western Barkley Sound, revealed an occupational history spanning much the same time period as Yuquot. Materials from the earlier levels at this site most closely resemble those known from the Strait of Georgia, particularly in the Locarno Beach stage, suggesting a long period of occupation prior to Nuu-chah-nulth arrival. RESUME La plupart des schémas historico-culturels Nuu-chah-nulth, y inclus le type généralisé de la Côte-Ouest, se basent principalement sur la longue séquence culturelle connue du site Yoquot, situé à l'entrée du détroit Nootka. Des travaux récents effectués plus au sud remettent en question les interprétations passés. Les fouilles au site de Ch'uumat'a, situé dans la partie occidentale du détroit Barkely, on révélé une séquence d'occupation qui s'étale sur plus ou moins la même période qu'à Yuquot. Des artefacts trouvés dans les couches anciennes de ce gisement s'apparentent à des objets trouvés sur les rives du détroit de Georgia et plus particulièrement dans les sites de la phase Locarno Beach. Ceci impliquerait une longue période d'occupation avant l'arrivée des Nuu-chah-nulth. INTRODUCTION 'T'he rugged west coast of Vancouver Island is A the ethnographic homeland of the Nuu- chah-nulth (formerly known as the "Nootka") peoples. Until recently, their precontact culture history was known primarily from the major vil- lage site of Yuquot (DjSp-1), at the entrance to Nootka Sound (Figure 1). Large-scale excava- tion in 1966 produced a large quantity of cultur- al remains and a series of radiocarbon dates spanning the last 4200 years. Dewhirst (1978, 1980) has argued for cultural continuity throughout this time, interpreting any changes in the archaeological record as reflecting increased adaptation to outer coast environments. In a review of the culture history known for the entire west coast of Vancouver Island, Mitchell (1990) proposed the West Coast culture type. This construct is identified by a distinctive cluster of artifact types, which Mitchell (1990:356) lists as: ... ground stone celts; ground stone fish- hook shanks; hand mauls; abrasive stones; unilaterally barbed bone points; single barb points; bone fishhook shanks; unilaterally and bilaterally barbed bone nontoggling harpoon heads; bone single points; bone bipoints; large and small composite toggling harpoon valves of bone or antler...; sea mammal bone fore- shafts; bone needles; bone splinter awls; ulna, tools; whalebone bark beaters; whalebone bark shredders; perforated tooth and deer phalanx pendants; mussel shell celts; and mussel shell knives. Small bone points and bipoints, predominantly parts of composite fishing gear, dominate such assemblages. The absence or rarity of flaked stone tools and flaking detritus is also seen as an identifying trait. In fact, stone implements in general are relatively rare. The major exception is abrasive stones, which were essential in the technology used to produce the numerous ground bone artifacts found and probably also served as a vital part of the woodworking toolk- it. Although Mitchell proposed this culture type for the entire west coast of Vancouver Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 22, 1998 5</page><page sequence="2">McMillan Island, it was based primarily on excavated data from Yuquot and nearby Hesquiat Harbour, the locations of the only major archaeological pro- jects in this area at that time. Materials recov- ered from the Hesquiat Harbour sites closely resemble those from Yuquot, although the earli- est deposits encountered date only to about 1 800 B.P. (Calvert 1980; Haggarty 1982). Claims of cultural continuity at these sites, particularly in the lengthy Yuquot sequence, led Mitchell to present this culture type as a relatively unchang- ing continuum leading directly to the historic Nuu-chah-nulth groups. Even the earliest mate- rials at Yuquot were considered so like historic Nuu-chah-nulth technology that Mitchell (1990:357) characterized the area as one "of rel- atively little change in subsistence and other aspects of technology." Excluded from the West Coast culture type were the materials from Shoemaker Bay (DhSe 2), at the end of the long Alberni Inlet from Barkley Sound (Figure 1). Although this area, around modern Port Alberni, is an important centre of Nuu-chah-nulth culture today, excava- tions at Shoemaker Bay in 1973 and 1974 revealed a different picture for the precontact past (McMillan and St. Claire 1982). Throughout the time period represented by these deposits, extending back as much as 4000 years, the cultural sequence was tied to the Strait of Georgia and was markedly dissimilar to the West Coast culture type known from the outer coast. The earliest component, termed Shoe- maker Bay I, is roughly contemporaneous with the Locarno Beach culture type in the Strait of Georgia and exhibits many of the characteristic features of that stage. Such traits include mid- den inhumation, including cairn burial; abun- dant chipped stone tools, including stemmed and leaf-shaped projectile points and knives; Figure 1: Western Vancouver Island, showing sites mentioned in the text. 6 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 22, 1998 ' ■P^^^feÈr COLUMBIA N. ^ ^ /¿Od*« /</page><page sequence="3">NUU-CHAH-NULTH CULTURE HISTORY Figure 2: The village site of Ch'uumat'a (DfSi-4). Midden deposits extend into the forested area at the back of the site. A cleared canoe run is visible on the beach in front of the site. ground stone points, including large faceted examples; and quartz crystal and obsidian microblades and microflakes (McMillan and St. Claire 1982). The later component, Shoemaker Bay II, most closely resembles the contempora- neous Strait of Georgia culture type in that region, although several artifact types indicate ties to West Coast sites (McMillan and St. Claire 1982; Mitchell 1990). This archaeological evidence for an earlier Strait of Georgia-related occupation was sup- ported by strong ethnographic traditions of very late Nuu-chah-nulth arrival in the Alberai Valley. This event is well recorded in oral tradi- tions and the ethnographic literature (Sproat 1868:179; Boas 1891:584; Carmichael 1922:51- 64; Drucker 1951:5; McMillan and St. Claire 1982:14; St. Claire 1991:30, 79-81; McMillan 1996:65-66, 290-294). The earlier occupants of the Albemi Valley were acculturated into Nuu- chah-nulth language and traditions, although traces of the Salishan language they once spoke persisted well into the 19th century (Boas 1891:584; Sapir 1913:77; 1915:19). This infor- mation helped explain the anomalous position of Shoemaker Bay in the archaeological record of the Nuu-chah-nulth area. It also fit nicely with the prevailing idea that the West Coast culture type was primarily an outer coast adaptation, only in very late times extending to the far inner reaches of the west coast. New evidence from several sites in Barkley Sound excavated in the 1990s has challenged this established view. A brief salvage excava- tion at Little Beach (DfSj-100), on the outer coast at Ucluelet, was conducted in the fall of 1991 (Areas Consulting Archaeologists 1991; Brolly 1992). The midden deposits were exam- ined by mechanical trenching, along with sever- al small controlled excavation units. This work exposed a considerable number of burials, some in shallow pits covered with low rock cairns. The main shell midden deposit containing these burials was dated to 4000 to 3000 years ago, with an overlying darker layer dating to 2500 years. Relatively few artifacts were recovered (n=68), but these include such diagnostic items as a leaf-shaped chipped stone projectile point, a crudely chipped cobble tool, a thick ground slate point fragment, and a fragment of what appears to be a large flanged labret. Such traits most closely resemble those known from Shoemaker Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 22, 1998 7</page><page sequence="4">McMillan Figure 3: Map of Ch'uumat'a, showing location of excavation units. 8 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 22, 1998 5 '6 i 8 9 A -^rfy ///// / X s*" ^^^^3/^ / / / / / / y^' DfSI4 Ch'uumafa '' nT^^^^^I^Hfi BBOBBèB^BBd one metre contour interval '. ^^^^v^?^ V^ s-^^-C 10 20 m :&lt;;:^Ií^r^W ^^^^ A vertical datum ■ completed ^^^^^^ rocks excavation units I A boulders 0 partially /^ w excavated units y extent of site ^</page><page sequence="5">NUU-CHAH-NULTH CULTURE HISTORY Figure 4.

The occurrence of such traits on the outer coast, near the entrance to Barkley Sound, was intriguing, leading the Little Beach excavators to suggest that "a complete revision of our understanding of West Coast history" was required (Areas Consulting Archaeologists 1991 :iii). Larger scale excavation, however, was necessary to assess this suggestion that Barkley Sound has an earlier history which dif- fers from that known from Yuquot. The Toquaht Project: Excavations at Ch'uumat'a The Toquaht Archaeological Project was also initiated in 1991. All research was conduct- ed in co-operation with the Toquaht Nation, the Nuu-chah-nulth group whose traditional territo- ry encompasses western Barkley Sound.

The most extensive excavations, conducted over two sea- sons, were at the large village of T'ukw'aa (DfSj-23), at the entrance to Ucluelet Inlet. This site yielded a large artifact sample that was markedly different from Little Beach, despite the close proximity of the two sites. The assem- blage from T'ukw'aa, which can be assigned to the West Coast culture type, is dominated by numerous small bone points and bipoints, while stone artifacts, with the exception of abrasive stones, are relatively rare and chipped stone is nearly absent (McMillan and St. Claire 1992). The contrast with Little Beach is attributable to different periods of occupation, as the dated deposits at T'ukw'aa all fall within the last 1200 years. In a search for older materials, the Toquaht Project shifted to the village site of Ch'uumat'a (DfSi-4), slightly further into Barkley Sound 10 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 22, 1998</page><page sequence="7">NUU-CHAH-NULTH CULTURE HISTORY Figure 5. Chipped stone artifacts from Ch'uumat'a. (upper row - projectile points, schist knife, pièces esquillées; lower row - andésite and chert debitage; the example on the far right has been reworked as a possible piercer) (Figure 1). Excavation was carried out during three field seasons between 1992 and 1996. In the first season, three 2 x 2 m units were exca- vated, including one in the forested area behind the highly visible, brush-covered, front portion of the site (Figure 2). Four metres of shell mid- den deposit were exposed in that unit and a radiocarbon date of nearly 4000 years was obtained from its base (McMillan and St. Claire 1992). On the front, brush-covered portion of the site, two 2 x 2 m units reached depths approaching four metres, with basal dates of about 2500 B.P. Depths of deposit and radio- carbon ages at base decreased in units closer to the beach (McMillan and St. Claire 1994, 1996). In total, approximately 1 15.7 m3 of deposit have been excavated at this site. The 1996 excavations were concentrated at the back of the site, in the forested area with the deepest deposits and oldest dates. The unit excavated in 1992 was extended into a 2-metre wide trench (Figure 3). The trench was stepped down at its ends, reaching sterile deposits at its base, roughly 4 m from the surface, for 7 m of its length. Nine radiocarbon dates provide a consistent chronology for the trench deposits (Figure 4). A date of 720 B.P. directly underlies the forest humus. Below that, the uppermost shell midden stratum is associated with two radiocarbon estimates of approximately 2500 B.P. Further dates of roughly 3000 B.P. and 3500 B.P. come from progressively lower strata. Finally, four dates from at or near the base of cultural deposits cluster between 3760+80 and 4000+140 B.P. All dates are given in uncali- brated radiocarbon years; see Figure 4 for the calibrated age ranges. Except for the uppermost date, the trench deposits are contemporaneous with Little Beach and Shoemaker Bay I, as well as with the late Charles and Locarno Beach cul- ture types in the Strait of Georgia. Although no major discontinuity is evident, the cultural sequence at Ch'uumat'a can be divided at about 2000 B.P. The earliest stage encompasses all the trench deposits, except for the uppermost, largely non-shell, stratum, along Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 22, 1998 n</page><page sequence="8">McMillan Figure 6.

(a - argillite; b, c - lime- stone; d - bone) bon dates of 2510+/- 110 and 2560+/-70 B.R The Ch'uumat'a examples appear to be identical to those from Little Beach. Cairn burials are also a char- acteristic of the Lo- carno Beach stage in the Strait of Georgia (Matson and Coup- land 1995:161), but are not reported for the West Coast culture type. Chipped stone artifacts are relatively abundant from the ear- lier deposits at Ch'u- umat'a (Figure 5). Two large bifacial pro- jectile points, one leaf- shaped and one stem- med, of basalt and andésite respectively, came from the trench excavation. Their place in the stratigraphy sug- gests an age of with the lowest levels ot the two deepest units in the front portion of the site. Of the site total of 750 artifacts, 340 can be assigned to the earliest stage. Several distinctive artifact types, includ- ing all chipped stone objects, are restricted to this early period. Conversely, certain artifacts characteristic of the West Coast culture type, such as stone and bone fishhook shanks, occur only in the later deposits at Ch'uumat'a. Table 1 lists all artifacts from Ch'uumat'a which have been assigned to the period prior to 2000 B.C. The presence of cairn burials is one of the shared traits linking the earlier deposits at Ch'uumat'a with Little Beach and Shoemaker Bay I, as well as with the Strait of Georgia. Two excavated burials, along with a third visible in the trench wall, were clustered together in shal- low pits, with concentrations of rounded cobbles extending above the pit surfaces (McMillan and St. Claire 1996). Two charcoal samples imme- diately adjacent to the burials yielded radiocar- between 3000 and 3500 B.R Two small pebbles showing bipolar flaking, classified as pièces esquillées, came from even deeper in the trench stratigraphy, dating to around 3500 B.R or slightly earlier. Several chipped schist tools include a complete, roughly circular knife, crudely chipped around its circumference, which came from a layer in the trench dated to about 2500 B.R The remaining items in this cat- egory are debitage from flaking activities. Those from the trench excavation consist of one broken and battered pebble of vein quartz and 12 flakes (two of vein quartz, two of quartzite, two of chert, and six larger flakes of andésite or basalt). All date to between about 2500 and 3500 B.R In addition, 18 flakes, all of green chert, came from several layers near the base of two units in the front portion of the site dating between 2000 and 2300 B.R Three of the chert flakes show evidence of edge retouch, in one case resulting in a sharp projection which prob- 12 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 22, 1998</page><page sequence="9">NUU-CHAH-NULTH CULTURE HISTORY ably served as a piercer. Including detritus, chipped stone makes up 10.6% of the artifact total from deposits predating 2000 B.P. at Ch'uumat'a. Although this figure is low compared to Locamo Beach sites in the Strait of Georgia region (Maison and Coupland 1995: Table 6-2), it is significant considering the virtual absence of chipped stone from Yuquot. The projectile points and schist knife have close parallels among the Shoemaker Bay I artifacts, as well as in Locarno Beach sites. Some of the ground stone artifacts suggest similar ties. Several fragmentary ground slate implements include the tip of a thick faceted projectile point, one of the diagnostic artifacts of the Locarno Beach Figure 7. Incised and drilled schist object from base of deposits at Ch'uumat'a. culture type (Mitchell 1990:341; Matson and Coupland 1995:156). Celts from this period tend to be small to medium in size, rectangular in cross-section, extensively shaped and flat- polled, similar to those described for Locarno Beach contexts (Mitchell 1990:341) and unlike the round-polled "pebble celts" which are most common in the earlier stages at Yuquot (Dewhirst 1980). One of the early Ch'uumat'a celts, however, is of the round-polled "pebble celt" variety. One small bit fragment of nephrite also suggests ties to the Strait of Georgia, as the closest major source area for this material is along the Fraser River, in the coastal mountains between Hope and Lillooet (Darwent 1996). Also from this time period are several care- fully shaped ground stone and bone objects of unknown function (Figure 6). They have a gen- eral similarity to artifacts from the Strait of Georgia region collectively termed Gulf Islands Complex items (or "whatzits"), which are high- ly distinctive artifacts in some Locarno Beach assemblages. Dahm (1994) argues that these are items of personal adornment, worn in, or sus- pended from, holes in the lips, ears, and nose. The Ch'uumat'a examples, however, are not made of the characteristic soapstone for that complex (Duff 1956) and do not closely match specific types established for the Strait of Georgia (Dahm 1994). One complete specimen, of black argillite, has flaring sides, parallel top and bottom, and one concave face (Figure 6a). It resembles artifacts in Dahm's "flared" catego- ry, as well as one illustrated by Duff (1975:34- 35) from a Gulf Island site, although it is lack- ing the central channel which characterizes sev- eral of these examples. Another is a white lime- stone "plug", circular in cross-section, with con- verging sides and a flat base and top. An addi- tional white limestone artifact, broken at its base, is a thin flattened curving object with a squared projection or "tab" on its upper surface. A fourth object, of dense highly-polished bone, is characterized by pronounced flattened flanges at its ends, although much of one has broken away (Figure 6d). A channel or groove runs the length of the object, making it somewhat similar to the "slide" category of Gulf Island Complex Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 22, 1998 13</page><page sequence="10">McMillan artifacts illustrated by Dahm (1994). Also of dense highly-polished bone are two small disks, one round in cross-section with flat faces and faceted sides, the other a flattened oval with sev- eral facets on each face (McMillan and St. Claire 1992:Figure 57). The first four artifacts came from the trench excavation, from a stratum dated to about 2500 B.P., making them contem- poraneous with late Locarno Beach examples. The two bone disks came from near the base of one of the front units, from a level between radiocarbon dates of roughly 2000 and 2300 B.P. In addition, a flat polished and incised object of greenish-grey schist (Figure 7) was excavated from near the base of the trench deposits. One face of this large fragment is incised with a design, following the shape of its scalloped dec- orative edge, which may be interpreted as a feather pattern. One small, biconically-drilled hole remains. This object was found in situ on an area of heavily burned shell and ash, with a small amount of charcoal which yielded a radio- carbon age of 4000+140 years. Somewhat sim- ilar fragments of schist and shale, with incised designs associated with decorative indented edges, came from equivalent time periods at the Glenrose site on the Fraser River (Matson 1976). Pratt (1992) identifies these as a charac- teristic trait of the Charles culture type, which precedes Locarno Beach in the Strait of Georgia at the time of the date on the Ch'uumat'a speci- men. In general, a significant number of cultural traits from the deposits predating 2000 B.P. at Ch'uumat'a show closer resemblance to materi- als from the Strait of Georgia, particularly in the Locarno Beach stage, than those from equiva- lent time periods at Yuquot. However, several distinctive traits of Locarno Beach components, such as quartz crystal microblades and microflakes, which are present at Shoemaker Bay, are lacking in the Ch'uumat'a assemblage. In addition, small bone points and bipoints, which dominate West Coast culture type assem- blages, including the later Toquaht materials, are also the most common artifacts in the early Ch'uumat'a deposits, making up 35.6% of the total. In all, bone and antler artifacts comprise 74.1% of the pre-2000 B.P. artifact total at Ch'uumat'a, compared to 42.6% of the Little Beach assemblage and only 13.3% in Shoemaker Bay I. Poor preservation of organics in the lower strata at Shoemaker Bay, plus Little Beach's small artifact sample and unique status as a burial site, obscure meaningful compar- isons. The ratio of bone to stone in the artifact assemblages at Little Beach and early Ch'uumat'a, however, would appear to be con- siderably higher than at Locarno Beach sites in the Strait of Georgia (Matson and Coupland 1995: Table 6-2). Other Archaeological Evidence Surface collections from several unexcavat- ed and undated sites in Barkley Sound and envi- rons also feature abundant chipped stone and other artifacts more closely resembling those known from the Strait of Georgia than the West Coast culture type as it is presently understood. Chipped stemmed and leaf-shaped projectile points, along with a variety of other chipped and ground stone tools, are in a collection from one such site (DeSg-10), near Bamfield in eastern Barkley Sound. Another large leaf-shaped biface is a beach find from Toquaht territory (McMillan and St. Claire 1991:69). A review by Mackie (1992), based on collections and records at the Royal British Columbia Museum, identi- fied numerous implements collected in Nuu- chah-nulth territory that appear to have their closest parallels in the archaeological sequence for the Strait of Georgia. These anomalous items include a zoomorphic sandstone bowl and an anthropomorphic steatite carving from the Clayoquot Sound area, as well as chipped obsid- ian leaf-shaped projectile points from both Clayoquot Sound and the head of Ucluelet Inlet (Mackie 1992). In addition, a ground stone object from Clayoquot Sound closely resembles Gulf Islands Complex artifacts from the Strait of Georgia described by Duff (1956; his "Type D") and Dahm (1994; her "solid rectangular," although the Clayoquot Sound object lacks the drilled holes of her examples). In addition, similar materials have been obtained from several excavated sites to the south of Barkley Sound, in the ethnographic ter- ritories of the Ditidaht and Makah, the close rel- atives of the Nuu-chah-nulth. Chipped stone tools, including a basalt contracting-stem pro- 14 Canadian Journal of Archaeology 22, 1998</page><page sequence="11">NUU-CHAH-NULTH CULTURE HISTORY jectile point and point preform, dominate the small artifact sample (33 items) from a 1 x 1 m test unit dug in 1996 at DdSc-12, near Port Renfrew. A single radiocarbon date of 4120+130 B.R came from near its base (Dahlstrom and Wilson 1996). Further parallels come from the extensive excavations at the Hoko River site (45CA213), in Makah ethno- graphic territory across Juan de Fuca Strait on the Olympic Peninsula (Croes 1995). A series of radiocarbon dates places occupation at this site between about 2800 and 2200 B.R, overlap- ping in time with the early Ch'uumat'a deposits. Although bone and antler artifacts have not been preserved, such lithic implements as chipped leaf- shaped and stemmed projectile points, chipped schist knives, faceted ground slate points, and vein quartz chipping detritus link Hoko River with the early periods at Ch'uumat'a and Shoemaker Bay, as well as the Locarno Beach culture type. DISCUSSION Models of cultural change requiring popula- tion movements have not found much favour among archaeologists in recent decades (Adams et al. 1978; Anthony 1990). In addition, ties to historically-known ethnolinguistic groups are notoriously difficult to demonstrate from the archaeological record. Croes and Hackenberger (1988) have argued that temporal stages defined on differing artifact assemblages are best inter- preted as broad plateaus in economic adaptation which extend across large areas, providing little insight into cultural affiliation or ethnicity. The differences evident, however, between Yuquot, with its record of cultural continuity to the his- toric Nuu-chah-nulth, and the early Barkley Sound sites (Ch'uumat'a, Little Beach, and Shoemaker Bay) suggest that the occupants of these two areas were culturally distinct prior to about 2000 years ago. Assemblages typical of the West Coast culture type in later deposits indicate that the earlier occupants of Barkley Sound, who were culturally related to those in the Strait of Georgia region, were replaced by Nuu-chah-nulth populations. This archaeologi- cal inference draws support from linguistic evi- dence suggesting expansion of Nuu-chah-nulth- speaking peoples in relatively late times. Linguists have placed the proto- Wakashan homeland on northern Vancouver Island, where a major division in the Wakashan language fam- ily separates the northern (or "Kwakiutlan") lan- guages from the southern branch, which includes the Nuu-chah-nulth (Thompson and Kinkade 1990:47; Foster 1996:81). From this supposed origin point, both divisions are thought to have expanded into their historic ter- ritories. As the groups which became the Nuu- chah-nulth moved south along the outer west coast, they left a chain of dialects from Kyuquot Sound to just south of Barkley Sound. Continued southward expansion later gave rise to the southernmost Wakashans, the Ditidaht and Makah. These languages differ only slight- ly from Nuu-chah-nulth and lack internal dialec- tal divisions, suggesting that they separated only recently from their northern relatives. The Makah are thought to have arrived in their his- toric homeland in relatively late times, replacing an earlier Chemakuan population (Kinkade and Powell 1976; Thompson and Kinkade 1990:47; Elmendorf 1990:440). Kinkade and Powell (1976) point out that some major place names used by the Makah have Chemakuan origins, and estimate that the Makah arrival on the Olympic Peninsula occurred about A.D. 1000. Wessen (1990:421), reviewing the archaeology of the Makah region, questions this late date, but not the assumption that the Makah are arrivals from the north. In this scenario, as the Nuu-chah-nulth (including those who later became the ancestors of the Ditidaht and Makah) expanded into already-occupied regions, the earlier popula- tions would have been displaced or absorbed. However, this does not preclude the modern Nuu-chah-nulth of the Barkley Sound area from considering the remains discussed here as those of their ancestors, as the Nuu-chah-nulth spread seems to have been accomplished by "linguistic capture" or cultural assimilation of the earlier residents. Strong ethnographic traditions con- firm that at least two of the modern groups were originally Salishan, but were acculturated dur- ing a late stage of Nuu-chah-nulth and Ditidaht expansion. These include the Opetchesaht, one of the two Nuu-chah-nulth political units in the Alberai Valley (Boas 1891:584; Sapir 1915:19; McMillan and St. Claire 1982:13-14), and the Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 22, 1998 15</page><page sequence="12">McMillan Ditidaht- speaking Pacheedaht near Port Renfrew (Clamhouse et al. 1991:289). Assessment of this scenario is hampered by the paucity of excavated and dated sites with deposits of sufficient age. Only five sites on the entire west coast of Vancouver Island have yielded excavated materials predating 2500 BP. Of these, only Yuquot and Ch'uumat'a provide well-dated sequences covering the last 4000 years. The differing nature of the excavated materials from the earlier periods at these two sites, plus the linguistic evidence for Nuu-chah- nulth expansion from northern Vancouver Island, support the contention that Nuu-chah- nulth arrival in Barkley Sound and to the south was a relatively recent event.
