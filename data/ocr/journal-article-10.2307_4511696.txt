Some animals that survive reappear in subsequent stories. This is a children's book, asserted for grades 7 through 9. By empirical in- vestigation, I found that, read aloud, it is a little old for a bright four-year old, and about right for a bright seven-year old (forgive parental vaunting). The stories are well written with occasional spurts of really fine prose. The emphasis is on the food chain of the bayou, and since this eats that continually it is not a book for children reared on the insipid anthropomorphism of Walt Disney animal stories. The stories are amazingly factual, and give a good portrait of animal mor- phology, behavior and ecology. The illustrations are generally quite excellent, but there is one bad mistake. On pages 82-83 the painting ostensibly depicts the female spadefoot coming to mate with the calling male of her species, but someone gave the artist the wrong photograph to copy for the male. Instead of being a spadefoot, with a vertical pupil (which the text correctly says characterizes these amphibians from all other American anurans), the male is in fact a Bufo toad, complete with horizontal pupils, parotid glands, warty skin and brown coloration! My only real complaint is the tremendous overemphasis on predator-prey relations in this excellent volume. Emphasis might have been spread among courtship, feeding by herbivores, protection from the elements, reproduction, growing up of the young and such things. On the whole, though, this is a book the likes of which we need more of.-Jack P. Hailman. BOOKS AND MONOGRAPHS 53. Peregrine Falcon Populations: Their Biology and Decline. Joseph J. Hickey (editor). 1969. Univ. of Wisc. Press, Madison. 596 pp. $10.00 - Once in a great while some ornithological volume becomes a classic even before we can review it. This book is an example. A conference was organized in mnid- 1965 to assess the status of Falco peregrinus; in a moment the results of that conference. Nearly every corner of the globe once had as either a breeding or winter resident one or another of the forms of the peregrine (the specific status of some forms is still under study). Not only is it world-wide, but also as handsome a bird as one could ask for. It may also be the fastest flier in the world. And now it has become the very symbol of man's destruction of his environment and the beauty it holds. I remember the first peregrine I ever saw: he was sitting on the now defunct Willard Hotel, two blocks from the White House in Washington, D. C. I suppose he did his share of cropping the pigeons and starlings that so plague the nation's capital. My elder son has seen a peregrine, but the younger one may never. This book documents why. There are five principal parts, following an introduction by Hickey and Anderson: status and trends of the populations, population trends in other reptors, behavior and ecology of raptors, population ecology, and a roundtable summing up and discussion of the results and problems. Although every effort was made to dissect out the entire complex of causes contributing to the pere- grine's decline, the blame clearly rests primarily with biocides. This book is not just an ecological horror story, albeit it is that in part. It is also one of the finest studies of a species of any kind of living organism. It is also a photographic study of beauty, which includes Arthur Allen's famous picture of a peregrine at Taughannock Falls, N. Y. - which perhaps rates as one of the finest photographs ever taken of a bird. And it is a book about basic and applied science. The transcript of discussions demonstrates the inquiring, probing nature of scientific minds interacting in a way that no summary could ever convey. Hickey opens the volume with; several quotes, among them this from Matthew Stevenson (1660): ". . .
