VALENS VODUSEK (Director of the Folk Music Institute in Ljubljana) IN the sixth century the Slovenes, under the protection of Avar forces, began to fight their way from the Danubian plains into the eastern valleys of the Alps, across the Karst to Langobardic Friulia, into Byzantine Istra and to the Adriatic Sea. In spite of more than a thousand years of political unrest, the primitive characteristics of their dancing and music have retained their distinctive character and ethnical unity as well as expressional kinship with their Serbo-Croat neighbours. In their new settlements the Slovene working people had to adapt their productive activity to the geophysical structure of the land, which is extraordinarily varied: to the north-west and north there are the high mountains of the Alps with narrow valleys along the rivers Sava and Soda; to the south of the Alps and in Carinthia, to the north of them, is a hilly country which descends towards the north-east to the Pannonian Basin, in the south-east to the plains of Bela krajina, and which in the south-west reaches across the Karst to the sea. The geophysical character of the country, which in folklore science has not been sufficiently taken into account, is one of the decisive biogenetic factors, which resulted in Slovenia in the creation of three decidedly different regional types: those of the highlanders, the hill-people, and the lowlanders. This difference of type is expressed in the people's walk, their productive activity and their dances as well as in the dialects of Slovene speech, song and music. Dancing. The highland dances are vehement and characterised by short, tense leaps, in which the partner is lifted high into the air, by turns and by tapping of the heel on the floor. The movement is strongly dynamic. The most important and the oldest living form of highland dances is the rej. The dancing couples form a circle and dance in combinations of ternary and binary rhythms in figures comprising tours and balancies. The rej is mostly polyrhythmic and irregular. Because of the general rationalisation, * The Editor regrets that owing to lack of space the report of the discussions on the papers has had to be omitted.</page><page sequence="2">SLOVENE FOLK DANCE AND FOLK MUSIC 5 the archaic relics of the rej are disintegrating into their component parts, which take on the rational forms of a two-step valse in ternary, or a polka in binary, rhythm. In the hill-dances the dancers form an open circle, standing one behind the other holding hands; thus they wind snake-like-in a "serpent"-across the turf, up hill and down dale, regardless of obstacles. The majority of still living archaic Slovene "serpents" have no definite choreographic figures. The winding into spirals-so- called "snails"-is not strictly rhythmical, neither are the choreographic movements of the "serpent" regular. In the lowland regions there is a definite tendency towards dances in a closed or open circle-the kolo, in which men and women all hold hands or dance in couples The upper parts of the body remain comparatively motionless, all the movement is concentrated in the legs. These dances have a short-time binary rhythm. A typical form of lowland dance is the rojna vrsta-a line, in which men and women hold hands and wind into "snails" and out again, alternating with a closed circle, and finally the serpent line runs through the "door" or the "bridge." In the "door" the whole line of dancers runs under the linked and lifted hands of the end-couple. In the "bridge" the couples form two groups, one of which stands with linked and lifted hands, forming the "bridge." The other group asks for permission to cross the bridge. Permission is granted, on condition that a "black-eyed maiden" is sacrificed. Thus a little girl is sent first under the bridge, then the rest of the dancers follow. After they have crossed the "bridge" three times, the couples disperse. These relics of former folk rites though they are growing weaker still reflect the original regional movements, the primeval motifs and the expressional contrast of ancient collective emotions. They are documents of the wonderfully tenacious creative force of the Slovene people and their productive activity. In the harvest rite of the Zilja Valley Stehvanje-Visoki rej, which is a rare example of the ancient tree cult preserved on the Continent, the dynamics of the dance gradually grow from a solemn, serious pace to vehement, impetuous leaps, in which the partner is lifted high in the air; the couples disperse in wild jumps. In the Metli?ko kolo which introduces the ritual relics of the funeral trizna-strave the "dance- serpent" walks solemnly and resignedly up-hill, then winds up in a snail, rushes into leaps and suddenly changes to the wild "grey horses" who run through the "door." In the rite of spring-sowing in Bela krajina, called Zeleni Jurij, the Jurij-devojka- formerly a girl, now usually a man, all decked out in greenery-stands in the centre of a circle; around him move the jurija?i (men); a kolo of women dances round in the opposite direction; the dance is at first solemn and slow, but gradually gathers speed, till the dancers disperse in ecstatic leaps. In a wild rush the jurijali drive the Jurij to the nearest running water to be "christened." Besides these relics of ritual dances, in some regions of Slovenia a few of the older dancers have preserved archaic dances which are really memorials of historic person- ages and events or symbolical representations of judicial customs or of the productive activity of the people. In the Zilja dance, up to the end of last century, the dancers knelt at sundown under the lime-tree and sang a song of gratitude to the sun-the high power of fertility-whose anthropomorphic representation with primitive Indo-europeans was a living tree. In the Metlika rite the vojarinka leads the kolo towards the sun; in the same rite, in the dance Most (bridge), the line of couples always stands in an east-west direction. The ritual dances are always performed at set times and places. Thus, for example, the visoki rej of the Zilja Valley is always danced under the village lime-tree</page><page sequence="3">6 INTERNATIONAL FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL after high mass on the Festival of the village saint; the Koranti dance during Carnival; the kolo "bridge" of Crnomelj in front of the town-castle on Easter Monday; the kolo of Metlika after vesper service. The majority of old Slovene dances are accompanied by singing, e.g. the Visoki rej and the megtrski ples (guild dance) of Prekmurje. The Predgrajsko kolo is silent in its middle movement. The dance of the Koranti is accompanied by the tinkling of the little bells at the dancers' belts and the stamping of their feet. It was above all the regional isolation which preserved many folk-dances in spite of the close communications with alien neighbours and the pressure of foreign political regimes (German, Italian and Hungarian). Yet the influence of alien dances may also be noticed. Through musician-dancers the well-known sedmorka (sette passi, Siebenschritt) has found its way also to Slovenia. During the last fifty years art dances from the bourgeois milieu have begun to penetrate into the old genuine folk dances. After the last world war, sport and dance societies introduced jazz and ball-room dances, whilst ballet-groups have brought to the villages sophisticated versions of the old dances. All this is disintegrating the genuine expressions of the people and spoiling their characteristic motions. Music. Besides three different types of dancing and a great variety of speech dialects, the Slovene people, in its fourteen centuries of development, has created as many as five typical musical dialects, each in its own peculiar territory: the Central, Carin- thian, Pannonian and Littoral dialects and that of Bela krajina. i. The territory of the Central musical dialect is Upper and Lower Carniola, the dialect group of Rovte, south-western Styria and Inner Carniola. The intonation is in natural major, the melodic compass rarely exceeds an octave--never in the older tunes. The intervals of the older tunes keep to diatonic fourths and fifths, in newer ones they often reach the sixth, the minor seventh and the octave. Popular melodic intervals are the tritone and the dominant seventh. The cadences close with an upper anticipation. The older ballad form, sung in the neumatic rhythm of the long epic line in litany form, has died out. Its modern successors are love-songs, songs for special occasions and songs connected with the productive activity of the people, dating from the nineteenth century, and the merry songs and toasts of a later date. 2. The Carinthian musical dialect is peculiar to the Carinthian Slovenes. The oldest tunes, which were sung in unison, are intoned in the D and G modes, whose relics, together with pentatonic remains, may be found in later heptatonically en- larged melodies. Newer tunes are sung polyphonically in five parts, the melodic compass regularly exceeds the octave, the intervals are wide, and cadences close with an upper anticipation. Melodic motifs have retained many archaic forms and usually show a choral-neumatic rhythm. A typical example of the older kind is the legendary ballad "Mary and the Miller" (see Example i), an example of the newer kind is the tune of the Visoki rej. The clarity, distinctness and softness of the Carinthian speech and special musical talent of our Carinthians have created a typical musical dialect, which distinguishes the folk-songs of Carinthia from those of the central parts of Slovenia. 3. The Pannonian musical dialect may be found in eastern Prlekija and Prek- murje. The small melodic repertoire approaches the diatonic heptatonic scale and is full of pentatonic remains. The melodic compass rarely reaches the octave, the intervals are narrow. Singing is mainly the domain of the women; the songs are</page><page sequence="4">SLOVENE FOLK DANCE AND FOLK MUSIC 7 sung diaphonically in two parts, later tunes also polyphonically in three parts (see Example 2). In the melodic repertoire we find old Pannonian cliches, relics of Lutheran hymns and, in the slight 'syncopations, the influence of the Hungarian neighbourhood. 4. In the Littoral musical dialect, i.e. in Slovene Istria and partly in the Venetian province, we find obvious traces and relics of the nearby Croatian Littoral. The intonation is in natural minor, with pentatonic remains, sung diaphonically. The compass is extraordinarily small (within fifths and sixths only). The intervals are diatonic. 5. In the musical dialect of Bela krajina the melodies are usually in an even, binary syllabic rhythm. In the refrain the choir proceeds in binary rhythm, singing diaphonically in octaves or even in fugato manner. The intonation keeps to the natural heptatonic scale, the melodic compass is extremely narrow (usually a fifth only, the intervals are mostly seconds) (see Example 3). Polyphonic folk singing is the peculiar domain of all Slovene regions and is most developed in Carinthia. Many-voiced singing by mixed choirs is heard everywhere in Slovenia, whenever people meet for public rejoicing. The middle female voices begin the melody, which is accompanied by the upper voices, so that the latter parallel the former at intervals of thirds, seconds, and fourths, while the lower ones sustain the foundation to the upper diaphony on oscillating tonics and dominants. After the leading voices have begun, the others take up the melody, first the upper, then the lower ones. At last the male voices come in, singing in parallel octaves to the female voices. Rather different is the traditional singing of the young men, meeting of an evening for a sing-song: one leading voice begins, a high baritone, who "sings first" (cantus firmus) (see Example 4). Some higher tenor voices join him, accom- panying the melody in the upper part in thirds, seconds, fourths and fifths, not in falsetto, but in high ordinary voice. This singing pays no attention to the rules of artificial harmony and does not keep regular time; it is a peculiar improvisation according to oral tradition. The drawing-out of the melodic line on the long vowels and in the closes shows pleasure in harmonic effects. Instruments. The folk-dances, danced by our peasant population on special occasions, were mostly accompanied by singing, and usually also by instrumental music. Wood- instruments were the most popular, especially flutes. The bark-pipes of the shep- herds are usually not tuned, but the finger-holes are cut casually. In Carinthia and Styria the flutes are sometimes cut either singly or in pairs for every given tune separately. The number of finger-holes depends on the melody. For more tuneful piping, the shepherds make a third instrument, which they call co?timanje. It is in essence a pan-pipe, composed of six canes, and supports the two flutes. From sharp grasses the shepherds make so-called piski; from hollow stalks they make trobe; from the fresh bark of poplar, aspen and birch trees they make trobila, a kind of funnel-shaped trumpet. Piping on leaves (of the pear or walnut tree or bracken leaves) is also popular. The widely used home-music "for fun" consists of a mouth- organ, a leaf and a broomstick stuck into the floor. A peculiar primitive instrument is the gudalo-dudalo, used particularly in Bela krajina, but known also in Lower Carniola and in the Drava Valley. It is akin to the Dutch rommelpot. This instrument is generally used with the mouth-organ, but it may be used by itself to accompany the kolo dance; it gives a wonderfully exact</page><page sequence="5">8 INTERNATIONAL FOLK MUSIC JOURNAL rhythm. Slovenska krajina has a similar instrument called dude or muga. The bag-pipes and reed-pipes of Istria, the so-called sopele, have been in use within living memory. Art instruments have been introduced by natural development and by the influence of town-players in the sixteenth century. These new instruments are the violin, the double bass, the cymbals, clarinets and the tamburica. In Bela krajina, up to the world war, the bag-piper accompanied the "silent" kolo at the midsummer dances, at weddings and church festivals. Later on they were replaced by tamburica- players. As early as the beginning of this century the town brass-bands were begin- ning to supplant the village musicians. The violin, demanding much skill, gave place to the louder clarinet, the unwieldy oprekelj to the simpler accordion, which even in far-off Bela krajina has supplanted the bag-pipe and the gudalo.
