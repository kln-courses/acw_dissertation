<plain_text><page sequence="1">Slochower 165 Applied Psychoanalysis As a Science and As An Art Prior to the advent of psychoanalysis, psychology was generally regarded as a science. But it held this position because it treated the mind as a physiological organ (the brain) which could be directly observed and measured. When psychoanalysis introduced the notion of psychic reality— especially the unconscious—which was not reducible to anatomical, physical and chemical elements, its scientific nature began to be questioned. Modern criticism of psychoanalysis is focused on its methodology. This is the emphasis in a recent Symposium On Psychoanalysis, Scientific Method and Philosophy.1 Thus, Ernest Nagel finds psychoanalysis wanting if judged by the criteria of a pure science, chiefly on the ground that he sus pects it can be so manipulated as to escape refutation no matter what facts are adduced. To begin with, it should be noted that Freud was clearly aware of and accepted this criterion. Writing about religious doctrines, he stated: "Of the reality value of most of them, we cannot judge; just as they cannot be proved, neither can they be refuted."2 The points raised in the Symposium are met in Robert Waelder's review in which he calls attention that the same objection could be made against scientific the ories, such as the theory of immunity.3 1 Edited by Sidney Hook.

The Scientific Character of Psychoanalysis Freud was a trained scientist and had a first hand understanding of the experimental method. The "deepest and strongest motive in his nature," writes Ernest Jones, was "to get at the truth with the maximum of certainty."4 Within the framework of an applied science, psychoanalysis meets basic scientific standards. 1. Freud labored to make his work "an empirical science" which "keeps close to the facts," and he viewed it as "always incomplete and always ready to correct or modify its theories."5 2. Psychoanalysis is a causal doctrine. It holds to a determinism in the psychic life which enables it to predict. Now, prediction is a crucial test of scientific method, and psychoanalysis can, within certain limits, "predict the past" (Hartmann and Kris) in recognizing that the neurotic repeats important phases of his life.6 And, by focusing on the character traits and personality profile of the individual, it can give a child did not have an Oedipus complex. John Hosper's essay in the Symposium effectively disposes of this logic which fails to recognize the dialectic method of psychoanalytic theory. He indicates that psychoanaly sis does not establish principles on the basis of single, individual items, but deals with recurrent examples which point to patterns of behavior, and that no one item alone validates or invalidates the theory: "The formulation is not 'If p then q,' but 'If p then q or r or s . . .' And since the disjunction is finite, it is emphatically not true that the Oedipus complex would be believed in no matter what the empirical facts are: if none of the items q, r, s . . . occurred, it would have to be concluded . . . that the individual in question had no Oedipus complex" (p. 343).— Robert Waelder grants that it is "thinkable" that an individual did not go through the Oedipus stage and yet developed normally, but this is not likely. 4 Ernest Jones: The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, vol. 2, New York 1955, p. 433. 5 Collected Papers, Vol. V, London 1950, pp. 129-30. « A dramatic example is Freud's revealing to Marie Bonapart a cradle scene from her infancy.</page><page sequence="3">Applied Psychoanalysis . 167 fair approximation of his future behavior. In this way, psy choanalysis can help the patient recognize the nature and limits of his creative potentialities. Here, the psychoanalytic notion of freedom as affective knowledge of one's nature is at one with Spinoza's idea of freedom. 3. Psychoanalysis is subject to a measure of public verification. To be sure, thus far, only fractional data have been made available. Still, we have public verification of pre verbal development through the study of child psychology. And as case histories and supervisions continue to be recorded, this scientific criterion can be met more and more. 4. As is the case in science, psychoanalysis rests on certain hypotheses which are revised or abandoned when not in consonance with empirical data. The modifications of Freud's own thinking bear striking testimony to his sensi tivity and readiness to reconstruct his theories. Yet, withal, psychoanalysis is a system which aims at establishing universal laws of human motivation—the topog raphy of the psyche. These are based, in part, on what Freud called the universality of speech symbolism.7 Freud attempted to find a "universal attribute of the instincts and perhaps of organic life in general."8 As Abraham Kaplan notes, this universality is not a fixed formula, not a literal recurrence of the elements, but a regularity and variability within certain limits.9 Now, the universality which psychoanalysis aims at is by way and through the individual, in his concreteness and sensuousness.10 In contrast, science attains its greatest effi 7 Moses and Monotheism, New York 1939, p. 155. 8 Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Bantam Books, New York 1959, p. 67. ® The New World of Philosophy, New York 1961. 10 For this reason, Freud was suspicious of "systems," that tend to impose facts on the frame of logic. (Cf. Autobiographical Study, N.Y. 1935, p. 110). His insistence that psychoanalysis has no unique "Welt anschauung," that its approach could be only that of a science in general, was in the interests of emphasizing its scientific neutrality and empirical nature. Even so, his formulation of its purpose indicates that it possesses more of a systematic structure than Freud was ready to acknowledge. Not only does it aim at a general psychology which would encompass</page><page sequence="4">168 Slochower ciency by eliminating the personal and individual element. Erwin Schrödinger, who won international renown for his work on wave mechanics in the field of quantum theory writes that science "Could go on just the same as it does, without there being consciousness, will, endeavor, pain and delight and responsibility ... Of the feelings of delight and sorrow . . . science is . . . reticent."11 Bertrand Russell once defined mathematics as "a science in which we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we say is true."12 Pure science uses an abstractive method to get at the similar properties in a number of objects. It is not concerned with the content of sensation, aiming at conceptual depth for which visible, audible and tactile sensa tions are not relevant. Indeed, the renowned mathematician Alfred Whitehead concludes that this approach reduces nature to "a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colourless."13 II. Psychoanalysis—A Dialectic Science Psychoanalysis does not and should not meet such scien tific standards for the obvious reason that it deals with a qualitatively different subject matter. The point Aristotle makes is here relevant : "It is the mark of an educated man to look for precision normal as well as pathological behavior, but its categories (id-ego-super ego etc.) form a structure in which one depends on and implies the other. In his General Introduction to Psychoanalysis (N.Y. 1935, pp. 60, 90), Freud writes: "Our purpose is not merely to describe and classify the phenomena, but to conceive them as brought about by the play of forces in the mind, as expression of tendencies striving towards a goal, which work together or against one another. We are endeavoring to attain a dynamic conception of mental phenomena . . . Our object is that of all scientific endeavor—namely to achieve an understanding of the phenomena, to establish a connection between them, and, in the last resort, wherever it is possible, to increase our power over them." 11 Nature and the Greeks, Cambridge University Press, London 1954, pp. 94-95. 12 Quoted by L. Felix in Modern Aspects of Mathematics, New York 1960, p. 52. 13 Science and the Modern World, New York 1928, p. 69.</page><page sequence="5">Applied Psychoanalysis . 169 in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits."14 In psychoanalysis, as in history, sociology, ethics and other investigations of human conduct and motivation, an experiment cannot be exactly reproduced, nor can an event or situation be reduplicated. That is, a "crucial experiment" is not possible here. Its objects of investigation have a history. They do not appear as a static, final product, but must be grasped in statu nascendi, and studied in their process. Furthermore, psychoanalysis confronts many more variables than do the natural sciences. Heinz Hartmann calls attention to the fact that every "case" is actually hundreds of "cases." He also makes the point that the specific character of the scientific method in psychoanalysis is shaped by a. the thera peutic context involving a therapist and a patient or a group of patients, b. the interchange between theory and practice.15 It is not enough for the analyst to know the general laws of psychopathology : he needs to note the individual manner in which a particular patient enacts them, must be open towards finding modifications or even exceptions to these laws.16 14 Nichomachean Ethics, Book I, Section 3. 15 In Symposium, op. cit. 16 In the view of eminent philosophers of science, natural science also shows "departures from the law." Charles S. Peirce whom Morris Raphael Cohen calls "one of the great founders of modern scientific logic," finds that scientific observation does not reveal exactitude. In Chance, Love and Logic (N.Y. 1923, p. 190), he writes: "Try to verify any law of nature, and you will find that the more precise your observations, the more certain they will be to show irregular departures from the law." An analogous point is made by Albert Einstein who notes that limited certainty also applies to those sciences which deal with physical existence : "As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and in so far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality." (A. Einstein and Leopold Infeld: Evolution of Physics, N.Y. 1938). In modern scientific thinking, exactitude is largely replaced by proba bility. Thus, Ernest Nagel, discussing "Principles of the Theory of Probability" (International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, Vol. I, No. 6, Univ. of Chicago Press, Chicago 1939) states: " 'Probable knowledge' is the only kind of knowledge we can find or exhibit . . . The doctrine that knowledge of matters of fact is only probable is one of the central theses of contemporary analysis of scientific method . . . perhaps the final coup-de-grace to the claim that physical principles are indubitable and necessary was supplied when the familiar physics of continuous action was found to be</page><page sequence="6">170 Slochower Furthermore, he cannot rest with explaining (as a natural scientist can) ; he must "understand" what the patient is saying and doing, noting his defenses and forms of resistance, and know how to communicate this understanding to the patient. That is, the characteristic feature of the psycho analytic setting is the union of abstract, general principles and a practical, individual relationship between two or more human beings.17 While Freud was a rationalist and believed that, in the end, "the voice of the intellect . . . after countless repulses," gets a hearing, he added that, as a psychoanalyst, he must "be more interested in affective than in intellectual phe nomena" (Autobiographical Sketch). The presupposition of applied psychoanalysis is that the mind is not a tabula rasa which can be studied by the method of Baconian induction.18 It is at odds with what Henry A. Murray calls "the doctrine of immaculate scientism."19Its implication is that there is no "pure" knowledge of human motives, that such knowledge is conditioned and shaped by the human mind and its affective expression.20 Moreover, the unique feature of applied psycho analysis is its focus on the individual, an element that has been called "ineffable."21 inadequate for vast ranges of phenomena, and made way for the contemporary physics of quanta." (pp. 4-5, 16). Possibly, Heisenberg's principle of indeterminancy may be another case in point. According to it, it is not possible to measure exactly both the position and velocity of individual electrons. 17 This living "encounter," as Jan Ehrenwald puts it, distinguishes human behavior. His essay "Doctrinal Compliance in Psychotherapy and Problems of Scientific Methodology" (Progress in Psychotherapy, vol. Ill, pp. 44-54) makes the suggestive point that precisely because of this personal factor, psychoanalysis can be more creative than natural science which works with impersonal instruments. He also indicates some paral lels between the method of psychoanalysis and that of modern physics. 18 In this sense, Freud might be considered the Protagoras and per haps the Kant of psychology. 19 See his stimulating essay in the Journal of Social Issues (Oct. 1962, XVIII, No. 4) on "The Personality and Career of Satan." 20 In this sense, Freud might be considered the Pythagoras ("Man is the measure of things"), and perhaps the Kant of psychology. 21 That an 'arbitrary element" is a formative part of science, making for its "scientific revolutions" and progress, is argued by Thomas S. Kuhn in his recent monograph "The Structure of Scientific Révolu</page><page sequence="7">Applied Psychoanalysis . 171 III. Applied Psychoanalysis as an Art As indicated, the ideal of science is neutrality, the neu trality of the objective observer. In this approach, science may be said to be indifferent to "the welfare" of its object. But, the psychoanalyst cannot be indifferent or neutral as to whether a man dies or survives. Furthermore, the patient presents a drama of conflicting powers, powers which are friendly or hostile or a mixture of both elements. This drama does not have a single, fixed meaning. A dream, for example, means different things to different people, or even to the same person in different contexts and life-stages. Beyond that, the analyst needs to focus simultaneously on the present and on the past which the patient reenacts "memonically." The role of the analyst, as the observer, interacting with the observed, introduces a complicating factor. Recently, in creasing attention has been given to the problem of "counter transference," and the notion of the analyst as a neutral, objective "mirror," is being greatly modified. It is now recog nized more and more that the personality of the analyst is relevant to the nature of the patient's "transference," and that the analyst's "countertransference" (provided it is of a non-pathological nature), contributes to the therapeutic cure. It may be noted that a similar "subjective" element operates in science. The Theory of Relativity, for example, is partly based on the consideration that the subject conducting the experiment makes a difference in the result of the experi ment. Still the Theory of Relativity obtains a formula of invariants and absolutes (the velocity of light and Space Time). It can do this by defining the observer. tions" (International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, vol. II, No. 2, University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1963, pp. 3 ff.). He discusses the new image of science which emerges from "a historiographie revolution in the study of science." This approach first discloses the historical legi timacy of a science or its "integrity ... in its own time." Furthermore, it shows that observation and experience "cannot alone determine a particular body of (scientific) belief," and that an "apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient in the beliefs espoused by a given scientific com munity at a given time." He also notes that his own analysis of science necessarily involves him in generalizations "about the sociology and social psychology of scientists."</page><page sequence="8">172 Slochower Similarly, the "intervention" of the analyst's personality does not invalidate his findings, provided he too "defines" it, that is, provided he becomes aware of his "countertrans ference," and analyzes the elements of projection it may contain. Ernest Jones speculated that "the deepest and strongest force" in Freud's life was the imaginative, artistic element.22 And the point I would make is that, as a practice, psycho analysis is more than a science, and primarily an art. Like art, it uses "emotive" language (I.A. Richard's term), various forms of symbolism, such as metaphor, simile, imagery, that is, processes of the imagination. Here, communication is not only through the grammar and syntax of language. The patient also communicates by the language of gesture, facial expression, changes in tone of voice. Here, the analyst needs to listen to and with "the third ear" (Theodor Reik) to discern the patient's leaps and aperçus, the ambivalences, ambiguities, oppositions and contraries, even as he needs to pay close attention to the logic of the manifest content. Applied psycho analysis deals with the poetry and tropism of the mind. Here, there is no fixed truth or error, no true or false doctrine, but an intricate mixture in which the "truth" is often embodied in "the error." Applied psychoanalysis seeks to discover the rationale of the irrational, the legitimacy of the illegitimate. "Truth" also is to be found in the patient's anti-intellectual, even psychotic communication, in the "thinking" of his body. Cure is not effected merely by intellectual comprehension (intellectualization is, indeed, often a "defense"), but pri marily through emotional perception and affective living through of earlier traumatic experiences. The nucleus of such matter cannot be reached merely by division and classification, that is, by the method of intellectual reduction, or by a succes sion of abstractions. Here, formal Aristotelian logic does not suffice, and we must have recourse to the dynamic logic of a concrete dialectic. Psychoanalysis, like art, replaces an ab stract-conceptual dialectic by a material-contentual dialectic which aims to uncover the dynamics of emotion without pre 22 op. cit. p. 432.—See my essay "Psychoanalysis and Literature" in Progress in Clinical Psychology, vol.

Riess, N.Y. 1960.</page><page sequence="9">Applied Psychoanalysis . 173 tending to offer final formulas.23 Now, the phantasy element which plays a central role in art and in applied psychoanalysis, also enters into scientific thinking, especially in the genesis of hypotheses. In Science and Hypothesis, Henri Poincare notes how he got to his theory by an apparently irrelevant incident, during a bus ride. There is also the saying attributed to the mathematician Christian Gauss that he knows the answer to a problem, but does not yet know how he is going to get to it. Yet, the imagination has a different function here. Science aims at increasing intellectual understanding by reducing, if not by eliminating the phantasy element.24 In summary : Psychoanalysis is both a scientific metodology and a curative process.25 It rests on basic principles contained in its metapsychology which give it a structural unity. It is a causal 23 For Hegel, too, formal dialectics is substantiated in its application to existence. Hegel wrote both a Logic and The Phenomenology of Mind, and his Philosophy of History has its dialectical counterpart in the his tory of philosophy.— Nagel's point in The Symposium that psychoanalysis is not scientific because it cannot be refuted appears to be an argument against the logic of a pure dialectics. In his Logic Without Metaphysics (Glencoe, 111., 1956), Nagel sees no value in dialectics because no observation can disprove it.—Nagel's point reminds of Kant's argument that in the realm of "pure reason," one confronts "antinomies," such as proofs that God exists and that he does not exist. Kant goes on to show that in the realm of "practical" reason, moral and immoral behavior can be distinguished. Similarly, in its practical activity, psychoanalytic theory is refutable. Indeed, therapeutic practice has led to important modifications of its theory, for example, the prominence given to the factor of countertrans ference. We also have the development of Ego psychology (represented most prominently by Hartmann, Kris, Lowenstein, Anna Freud). This psychology notes "conflict-free" spheres of the ego in perception, thinking, memory and action in which the social-cultural aspects of human be havior are considered along with the biological. Here, a distinction is drawn between genesis and function.—In its application to cultural areas, psychoanalysis is essentially ego psychology.— Nearly everything which Freud wrote is permeated by his dialectical mode of thinking, and appears in his basic classifications : Eros-Thanatos, Sadism-Masochism, the Pleasure-Reality principle etc. 24 Robert Waelder (op. cit.) points out that psychoanalysis has one advantage over the method used in the natural sciences. We have "one source of knowledge about psychic events that is completely lacking in the physical world, viz. introspection and its equivalent in the observa tion of other human beings . . 25 In this dual aim, psychoanalysis exemplifies what Ferenczi and Rank call "utraquistic" research. They trace the term to the Utraquists, a religious sect which believed in partaking of both the bread and wine</page><page sequence="10">174 Slochower doctrine which, within the limits imposed by the enormous complexity and fluidity of its human material, has the scien tific character of prediction. Yet, applied psychoanalysis has an anthropomorphic character, that is, it is not neutral or indifferent towards its subject. The specific nature of its material calls for a different type of logic than that employed in the pure sciences. Whereas the logic of the latter is largely based on classes, that of the former is based on the continuity of individual parts, forming a series bound by underlying categories. The therapeutic sub ject can be understood only in terms of a series of analogous forms or patterns, that is, by a concatenation of various "levels."26 Borrowing Ernst Cassirer's formulation in his monumental The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, applied psy choanalysis aims at "objective anthropomorphism." Here, as in art, the emphasis is on denotation—on the individual and the sensuous, rather than on connotation—the general and ab stract, combining the nomothetic and the idiographic. Because its subject matter is human life, applied psychoanalysis, like art, cannot and should not be a pure science. Attempts to turn it into such can only mean an impoverishment, if not a nullifi cation, of its effectiveness. The decisive act in its approach is an act of the imagination. Its function is rather to serve as a link between science and art.27 Harry Slochower, Ph.D., New York City of communion.—See the chapter "The Development of Psychoanalysis" in S. Ferenczi's Sex in Psychoanalysis, Dover Publications, N.Y. 1956, p. 47. 26 The term "levels" is suggested by Hans Freistadt in an article on "Dialectical Materialism" in Philosophy of Science (April 1956 and Jan. 1957, vols. 23, 24). In his formulation, "levels" are "chunks of the universe . . . characterized by a unique combination of qualitatively dis tinct concepts" (April 1956, p. 104).— K.M. Colby's Energy and Structure in Psychoanalysis (N.Y. 1955) indi cates the relation between Freudian metapsychology to the mathematical and physical sciences. His Introduction to Psychoanalytic Research (N.Y. 1960) suggests methods of using scientific techniques in psychoanalytic research.—See also E. Pumpian-Mindlin : Psychoanalysis as Science, Stanford University Press 1952. 2? The bifurcation between science and art is primarily a modern phenomenon. No such separation was felt up to and including the Renais sance. Leonardo is an outstanding example of the linkage between science and art.
