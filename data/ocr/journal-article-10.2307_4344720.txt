<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 81 ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS TO BE READ AT APA MEETING, DECEMBER 1961 ED. NOTE: By the courteous action of the Directors of the American Philological Association at their meeting in New York, October 28, 1961, we are privileged to present below abstracts of the twenty- six papers accepted for oral presentation at the Ninety-Third Annual Meeting of the Association, Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan, December 28-30, 1961. It is hoped that this prior publication of ab- stracts will serve "to facilitate and to encourage" discussion from the floor and to call attention, especially among readers of CW who may not at present be members of APA, to the range and interest of the papers to be read. To insure publication in the present issue, it was necessary to print the abstracts essentially in the form in which they were submitted to APA in Sep- tember; considerations of time likewise prevented us from submitting proof to authors, so that, while all reasonable care has been exercised, final res- ponsibility for the form in which the abstracts appear must rest with the CW editorial office.* It is understood, of course, that speakers will enjoy their usual liberty to cast their oral presentations in the form they desire. The abstracts are here listed alphabetically by name of speakers; for de- tails of date and time of presentation, length, etc., not available when copy was sent to our printers, please consult the official program. now available from the Secretary-Treasurer of the Association, Dean Harry L. Levy, Hunter College in the Bronx, New York 68. N. Y. 1. The Role of Fcaunus in Horace, C. 1.4, by Charles L. Babcock, University of Pennsylvania. Horace's C. 1.4 on the inevitability of death has been cited for the sudden and unexpected en- trance of death in line 13. By careful composition and choice of words and subjects, Horace prepares the listener for the statement of his theme. Lines 13 and 14 are to be taken as the oracular response of Faunus, who appears in the poem both as pro- tector of herds and as oracle, and to whom the sacrificant of lines 11-12 has addressed a question about the significance of the change then being witnessed as winter yields to spring. The two lines reflect the dark side of Faunus' character and his use of Saturnian verse, which Horace suggests by special poetic devices. The second part of the poem begins with o beate Sesti, which breaks the ruistic scene of 1-14. 2. Aristotle's "Forms of Democracy," by Mor- timer Chambers, University of California, Los Angeles. In Book 3 of the Politics Aristotle refers to democracy as one possible constitutional form among six. But in Books 4 and 6 democracy is further analyzed into several forms, according to the degree of popular control of affairs in each form. The number of these forms is once said to be five, but in two other passages it is four; and this is the number finally settled on. The doctrine was presumably meant to be ap- plicable to real states; to see whether Aristotle ever applied it, one would naturally consult the Ath6nai6n Politeia, where Athenian constitutional history is surveyed in detail. In chapter 41 Aristotle registers some eleven metabolai through which the state had allegedly passed. Among these stages, four are forms of democracy, viz. Solon's constitu- tion; Cleisthenes' constitution; the domination by the Areopagus from 479 to 462; and radical demo- cracy, installed by Ephialtes (this form was tem- porarily overturned twice but was twice restored without essential change). The correspondence be- tween four forms of democracy in both the Politics and the Ath. Pol. suggests that the latter work tried to find an example, in Athenian history, of the more general theories of the Politics (which had already been written). Aristotle's sources for the Ath. Pol. did not provide him with a ready-made doctrine of four "forms"; and historical examination shows tnat the Solonian state and the alleged Areopagite primacy are each distorted to make them into forms of democracy and to fulfill the scheme. We must conclude that Aristotle did not keep historical re- search free of influence from philosophical doctrine, a fact that has obvious implications for historians who wish to use the Ath. Pol. as a source. 3. A Problem in Euripides' Hippolytus, by D. J. Conacher, University of Toronto. At Hippolytus 507-15, Phaedra's Nurse seeks again to persuade her mistress to abandon her suicidal intent and to accept a mysterious remedy for her guilty love. Earlier in the episode, Phaedra has resisted similar arguments from the Nurse, since they have hinted clearly at the procuring of Hippolytus for her mistress. What, then, causes Phaedra to yield at least a grudging compliance with the Nurse's plans at the end of the present passage? Previous interpretations of lines 507-8 have fail- ed to provide a satisfactory sense in the context; deutera gar hd charis (508) has, in particular, been the subject of much disagreement. A new interpre- tation of these lines may help solve the problem stated above. Answering Phaedra's high-minded re- pudiation of her suggestion, the Nurse declares: If that is what you think, then it was not right for you to go astray (i.e., by falling in love. ; still, if that is r eally your view of the matter, then listen to what I now have to suggest; for the actual gratification of your love is a second- ary consideration. (507-8) An examination of various usages of ei d' oun and of charis (508) validates the meanings attri- buted to them here and arguments are advanced to establish the relevance of the Nurse's statement in the larger context of the passage. Previously (in her rejected plea) the Nurse had admitted that eune and hedone (495-6) played an essential though deprecated part in her plan. Now she implies (how- ever deceitfully) that she has hit upon a new way of saving Phaedra, without including this base element in the "cure". It is this assurance which persuades the tortured Queen. 4. Accidents in Aristotle, Ath. Pol. 26.1, by James Day, Vassar College. In Ath. Pol. 26.1 are mentioned three accidents that "befell" the state (Aristotle's words here are :.We have, for example, transliterated all Greek words and, in certain cases, omitted diacritical marks unavailable in our regular type faces.</page><page sequence="2">82 THE CLASSICAL WORLD symbainein and sympiptein). There is an argument in three parts: (1) the meaning of the text is not self-insuring, i.e. mere inspection will not decide just what Aristotle is doing with the words; (2) symbainein in Ath. Pol. looks like a historian's word but comparison with instances in Herodotue and Thucydides fails to account for it; (3) sym- bainein is a philosopher's word in a historicai con- text; and there are consequences: so explaining the word in the Ath. Pol. that it is at all congruent with Aristotle's other uses for it carries an entail- ment, viz. the Ath. Pol. is thrust en face with the Politics. The historical narrative cannot be under- stood apart from the theory in the Politics. 5. Thucydides and the Number of Akharnian Hoplitai, by Sterling Dow, Harvard Universitv. Thucydides, in a famous but baffling parenthesis (2.20.4), gives the number of hoplitai furnished by Akharnai as 3000. Scholars are agreed that the number is grossly excessive, but there is no agree- ment as to the facts involved. The paper is in three parts: (1) the MSS all have '3000' and no emendation or explanation thus far proposed is even plausible; (2) new data on representation in the Boule, combined with old data (never used) on Akharnai-all these fit together -show that Akharnai can have furnished only 1200-1600 hoplitai; (3) it is shown for the first time that the context, not hitherto considered, of Thucy- dides 2.20.4 demands some such large number as 3000. That explains why Thucydides wrote it: in his enthusiasm to create an impressive narrative, and in particular here, to make the first Pelopon- nesian invasion interesting, Thucydides exaggerated grossly. This is the largest proved numerical error in Thucydides. It is suggested that the failure to read Thucydides critically (also, in this particular case, the baseless rejection of all the MSS) has led to a mistaken understanding of him. He was not in- humanly perfect, but he was far more interesting than he has been made to seem. 6. Turnus and Duryodhana, by George E. Duck- worth, Princeton University. The traits and actions of Turnus have been fre- quently related to those of Achilles and/or Hector (cf. W. S. Anderson, TAPA 88 [1957] 17-30), but many features in Vergil's portrayal of Aeneas' great opponent seem non-Homeric, e.g. desire for death and attempted suicide, unwillingness to make peace or abide by the truce, reluctance to face Aeneas and resultant feeling of guilt. These characteristics of Turnus, usually consid- ered Vergil's own creation, may result from the poet's use of another epic source. Mlle. Josette Lallemant in Latomus 18 (1959) 262-87 discusses Vergil's indebtedness to the great Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata, and a re-examination of the rele- vant material supports and strengthens her conclu- sions. Both the characters and the structure of the Great War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas provide numerous and amazing parallels to the second half of the Aeneid. Aeneas resembles Yudhisthira, the righteous and pious leader of the Pandavas; Latinus is as helpless as King Dhrtarastra, father of Duryodhana and the other Kauravas; Drances has much in common with Karna, who is wealthy, an able orator, and accused of cowardice; Pallas resembles Abhimanyu, the brave young man whose death is lamented by his general and his father and blamed on Duryodhana; the parallels between Turnus and Duryodhana are especially numerous. The events of Aeneid VII-XII (omitting VIII, Aeneas at Rome) resemble to a surprising degree those in Mahabharata V-IX. These similarities are too numerous to be ascribed to chance. Aeneid XII, considered the most Homeric book of the Aeneid, has more from the Mahabharata than any other book. According to Dio Chrysostom, the Homeric epics were translated into Sanskrit; was the Mahabharata translated into Greek? The verbal parallels imply that Vergil had a translation rather than that he gained the information by oral trans- mission. Parthenius may have brought the Sanskrit epic to Vergil's attention. 7. Intensification of Meaning int Propertius an(l Oth,ers, by Mark W. Edwards, Brown University. The paper identifies some of the ways which Latin poets used to increase the significance and impact of the words they used, dividing them as follows: Effects of use of more than one meaning of a word or phrase, comprising syntactical ambiguities (in which two meanings may be co-existing or alter- native, or one may be transient) and lexical ambi- guities (where again there may be two co-existing or alternative meanings, or the effect may arise from the word's other associations); Effects of the juxtaposition of words which are not syntactically connected, including the use of hypallage; Effects of exceptional stress on single words. In each case earlier work on the technique is briefly reviewed, a few examples which have been noticed in Latin poets are given, and the instances of the occurrence in Propertius are listed, with com- ment on the effects where appropriate. An excursus is appended on the use of the i-longa to distinguish the accusative plural from the genitive singular of 3rd declension i-stems in Augustan MSS. 8. "Zeus, Whoever He Is . . . ," by Leon Golden, College of William and Mary. Two major theories have been advanced as ex- planations of the character of Aeschylus' Zeus. The first interprets Zeus as a god of an advanced morality who is similar to the Judaic-Christian concept of God. This view has been rejected by recent scholars because of the lack of textual evid- ence for it and its inadequacy in explaining a number of important actions of Zeus. The alterna- tive theory states that Aeschylus' Zeus is simply a primitive, anthropomorphic deity who behaves in an arbitrary manner. Important evidence used to support this view is taken from the Agamemnon. The present paper reviews the evidence bearing on Zeus in the Agamemnon and shows that it contra- dicts rather than supports an anthropomorphic in- terpretation of the god in this play. The twenty-two references to Zeus in the play are analyzed and it is shown that twenty of them describe him as some natural or spiritual force in the universe and are completely devoid of any an- thropomorphic content. The two references which have possible anthropomorphic connotations are</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 83 analyzed and it is shown that they may easily be understood in a metaphorical sense. For these reasons it is argued that we have no justification for interpreting the Zeus of the Agamemnon as an anthropomorphic deity. On the basis of this analysis of the evidence from the Agamemnon the thesis is presented that the Zeus of this play is actually a symbol of all of the forces that exist in the world. It is shown that all human and natural events are traced back to Zeus as their ultimate cause and that his theolo- gical function is clearly defined by the chorus which addresses him as the "Cause of All" and the "Doer of All." It is then argued that this interpretation of Aeschylus' Zeus as a symbol of all of the forces in the universe removes many of the absurdities and contradictions in his behavior which have troubled interpreters of Aeschylus' work. 9. A Greek Professorial Circle at Rome, by G. P. Goold. University College, University of Toronto. This paper revives, with much new argument, the theory (CQ 32 [1938] 133f.) that On the Sublime was written by Gnaeus Pompeius Geminus, a correspondent of Dionysius of Halicarnassus; its date is established as A.D. 12, the argument being largely based on four passages in Manilius inspired by 'Longinus.' Eduard Norden's elaborate paper in Abh. d. Berl. Ak. (1959) is discussed and refuted, and the conclusion drawn that 'Longinus' was Jewish. Demetrius's On Style is, by means of a critical examination of G. M. A. Grube's recent edition (Toronto 1961), determined as having been written C. A.D. 1 by the Demetrius to whom was dedicated the De Imitatione of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. The paper appraises anew some aspects of the literary theories of Dionysius, 'Longinus,' and Demetrius, who are held to have been members of a Greek professorial circle at Rome; and concludes with observations on bilingualism in the Augustan age. 10. Body and SouZ in Vergil, by E. Adelaide Hahn, Hunter College. Vergil acquires evocative overtones by misusing the axiom "things equal to the same thing are equal to each other." I have studied his "confusion" of man with name, god with function or province or statue, ethnographical with geographical terms. Now I study "body" and "soul"; either may equal ego ("poor old body", "poor old soul"), so they become confused with ego or each other. Corpus and anima may be: appositive of word for person (vos imperdita corpora, nos animae viles); coordinate with it (viri defunctaque corpora vita heroum, Tarquinios reges animamque Bruti); balanced with it (ante omnia corpora Nisus emicat, pro cunctis unam obiectare animam); equivalent to se or me (corpora saltu ad terram misere, hanc animam serves). Their use enriches picture. When death separates corpus and anima, com- plications arise (both philosophical and linguistic). Anima departs; corputs 'corpse' remains. Ego is neither. Nisus alive, Palinurus in Hades, call their corpora me; Aeneas calls corpora of Lausus (dead on earth) and of Deiphobus (shade in Hades) te. But in exsolvit se corpore, se=soul. Some passages mix the two views. The immortal part dwells in tomb or in Hades; returns to earth as fury, ghost, or dream. Anima, vita, umbra, manes, imago, simulacrum are mixed with one another and with corpus. Corpus illogically placed in Hades: defunceta corpore vita, subvectat corpora cumba. Corpora viva (of Aeneas crossing Styx) should be just corpora, for in Hades there are animae, not corpora mortuta. Anima illogically placed in tomb (animam sepulero condimus); mantes are with ashes; anima receives flowers. (This in- volves linguistic confusion, not merely Roman religion as opposed to Greek.) Very odd: omnia Deiphobo solvisti et funeris umbris. Funus ('corpse') does not possess umbrae, but Deiphobus does, and funeris = eiuis (corpus confused with ego) Oral presentation will include innumerable ad- ditional examples. 11. Two Manuscripts in the Lilly Library. Bloomingtont, Indianta (illustrated), by James W. Halporn, Indiana University. Among the manuscripts now at the Lilly Library, Indiana University, are a Psalter written in Italy in the Beneventan script and a manuscript in Carol- ingian script containing a portion of a homily of the Venerable Bede. This paper gives a palaeogra- phical description of these manuscripts, together with a study of the form and contents. The Beneventan Psalter can be dated to the second half of the twelfth century. Evidence from the liturgical contents indicates that the manuscript came from the monastery of San Domenico at Sora (Latium), and is one of three extant manu- scripts from that center. The Bede Homily is a section of a manuscript of which another part is now at the Detroit Public Library. The manuscript, written in North Italy at the end of the ninth century, is an early copy of the collection of homilies compiled and edited by Paul the Deacon at the end of the eighth century. 12. The Ritual Origini of Pastoral, by Richmond Y. Hathorn, Louisiana State University. The common rejection of the ancient accounts of the origin of pastoral poetry in certain Dorian, especially Sicilian, fertility-festivals stands in need of re-examination. This rejection fails to consider that literary origins may be of various kinds, that they may focus on the genesis of form and content as well as concern themselves with psychological and sociological factors. The refutation in the 1890's of the ritual-origin theory of R. Reitzenstein merely confused the issue. Actually the ancient accounts explain better than anything else certain peculiar features of pastoral. 13. Aeschylus, Prometheuts Unbound, Fr. 193 (Titanum suboles . .. ), by C. J. Herington, Smith College. This paper aims to remove the persistent doubts (still recorded, for instance, in the latest Oxford text of Aeschylus) about the authenticity of the fragment. Is it merely a quotation from a play by Accius? Or is it a direct translation by Cicero from Aeschylus-in which case it constitutes by far the longest, and not the least significant, fragment of the Prometheus Unbound? The text of the fragment is first presented, with apparatus criticus and a brief commentary which lists the apparent parallels in the surviving plays</page><page sequence="4">84 THE CLASSICAL WORLD of Aeschylus. Next are discussed the early chapters of the Second Tusculan Disputation, in which it is preserved. It appears that on all grounds-Cicero's practice in quotation here and elsewhere, the impor- tance of Aeschylus, both as poet and as philosopher, for the argument which is being developed in these chapters, and finally Cicero's own admissions in Section 26-the passage must be considered a direct translation. This result is corroborated by the evidence of the lines themselves: (a) the wording of the frag- ment, even in its Latin form, is closely related to that of the Prometheus Bound; (b) of its three most striking images, two are shown to be charac- teristically Aeschylean, and the third is shown to be linked by its vocabulary (though not by its sense, which is unparallelled) to a passage in one of Cicero's original poems. Finally, the vindicated lines are replaced in the context of the Prometheia, and their significance briefly discussed. It is suggested that, while they tell little about the plot, they do add to our under- standing of Prometheus' character, and of a remark- able feature of Aeschylus' technique in the first two plays: systematic repetition. 14.- The Authorship of the Strasboury Epodes, by G. M. Kirkwood, Cornell University. Controversy as to the authorship of the three fragmentary epodes printed as Fragments 79a, 79b, and 80 of Archilochus in Diehl's Anthologia Lyrica Graeca has gone on since the two fragments of papyrus (one containing 79a and b, the other 80) were published in 1899. Fr. 80, in the third line of which the name Hipponax apparently occurs, is almost certainly by Hipponax. In the past decade nearly all editors and critics have assigned 79a to Hipponax also, even though general considerations of style strongly indicate Archilochus. (79b is too slight a fragment to provide evidence or to be worth debate.) Ascription of 79a to Hipponax has been based on two considerations, the presence of an instance of Attic correption in the poem and the alleged improbability of the two fragments being from an anthology. The one recent editor, Max Treu, who has not assigned both to Hipponax felt driven to regard Archilochus as author of both, in order to avoid the supposition of an anthology. The present paper undertakes to renew a oro- posal first advanced by Jurenka in 1900 and main- tained by Cantarella in 1944, that the two fragments are from an anthology, and that Archilochus wrote 79a, Hipponax 80. The matter of Attic correption is dealt with briefly, by a demonstration of the fact that early lyric, like Homer, occasionally allows this metrical abnormality; strenuous and unwar- ranted conjecture has been the recourse of those who are unwilling to accept this fact. The main point of the paper is a proof, by examples, that at least four other papyrus anthologies exist that differ more than the Strasbourg Epodes from the normal form of an anthology, and that the now dominant conviction that the Strasbourg Epodes are unlikely to be from an anthology is therefore unjustified. The paper ends with a brief consideration of two points of style and imitation, and argues that (a) tr6g6n . . . doulion chorton (Hipponax 36) is not written by the poet who wrote doulion arton ed6n in 79a; (b) the curse in Alcaeus G 1 (L.-P.) is modelled on 79a, and this imitation is a much more reliable proof of Archilochean authorship than it has been recognized as being. The suggestion that 79a, with Hipponax as author, may imitate Alcaeus is shown to be at variance with the practice of Hipponax, who was a parodist, not an imitator. Alcaeus, on the other hand, imitated frequently and skillfully. 15. The Vocabulary of Fear inl Latin Epic Poetry, by L. A. MacKay, University of California, Berkeley. This study investigates what light may be thrown on the technique and emotional processes of Virgil, Lucan, and Statius by an examination of the frequency, concentration, and diversity of their references to fear, and their choice of words. Ovid is added for comparison, as an example of extended non-epic narrative verse. Fear was chosen as one of the dominant and characteristic emotions of tragedy, to which in theme epic is closely akin. Pity was omitted, partly in the interests of concen- tration, partly because fear is more adequately re- flected in the vocabulary of the Latin hexameter, which cannot call a man misericors, or refer to his misericordia. The vocabulary of fear, on the con- trary, is reasonably rich. Twelve words, or groups of related words, were examined. In the Aeneid, the Pharsalia, the Thebaid, and the Metamorphoses, 59 words were recognize(d as evoking the idea of fear, to a total of 1734 occurrences. Borderline cases (in such words as horreo, tremo, etc.) make it impossible to regard the totals as absolutely precise; but the margin of error is not great enough to be significant. Analysis of the figures shows how markedly Lucan, and still more Statius, exceed Virgil in re- ferences to fear, and demonstrates in their work a more monotonous regularity in the distribution of the references. Individual preferences and avoidan- ces in vocabulary also become evident, and the most marked of these are briefly discussed. 16. Oral Bards at Delphi, by Wallace E. McLeod, University of Western Ontario. Delphic oracles in hexameter verse are sprinkled so liberally with epic phraseology as to indicate that some of them were composed in the oral tradi- tion. We conclude that an oral bard served the shrine of Apollo from soon after 750 (when the sanctuary was established) until after 400. This conclusion accords with what little we know of the operation of the oracle and the history of the oral technique; it explains moreover how oracles could be improvised. Probably the office of bard was filled by the prophStai; at any rate the bards were of local (Delphic) provenience. Consequently we pos- tulate a "Phocian School" of oral poets; preliminary analysis of the formulas shows that this school was related to the Boeotian and Ionic Schools, but yet apparently with distinctive characteristics of its own. 17. Vergilian Glosses inl the Stonyhurst Medulla, by Robert T. Meyer, Catholic University of America. The Medulla is a Latin-English glossary of the fourteenth century. The Stonyhurst MS has been chosen as it is a better preserved copy than those mentioned by Way in his edition of the Promp- torium Parvulorum (London 1843). Such antiqua-</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 85 rians as Tanner and H. Spelman were acquainted with copies of a variety of the Medulla and quote from them in their works. To call the work a Latin-English dictionary is a misnomer, since many of the lemmata are them- selves defined in Latin, and are as much unchanged as similar ones in the Liber Glossarum. Some of them go back ultimately to those early glossaries as Abavus and Abstrusa which were originally col- lections of glossae collectae on the text of Virgil. These lemmata with their definitions quite, often come down to us in the same form, but have oc- casionally been translated into Middle English, the translation itself being a slavish rendering of the Latin original. Thanks to the preservation of some of the early glossaries in Goetz-Loes, Corpus Glos- sariorum Latinorum we can trace many Medulla items to their original source. The source of the interpretation of the Hebrew names as: Melchesedec (sic) .i. rex iustus, 40b as well as the Greek-Latin items as: affros, graece: spuma, latine, 2b are from Isidore ultimately and do not concen l.ls here. 18. Fortwwite's Wheel: The Symbolism of Sopho- cles' Women of Trachis, by Herbert Miusurillo, S.J.. Fordham University. An inmage-analysis of the Trmchtinie further un- derlines the play's profound theme, the power of love, set against the theological background of Zeus's providence and the wheel of Fortune. rhe eight dominant images of the play are the sea of trouble, the wrestling contest, the tender blossom, the disease of Heracles, the blood of Nessus, the poisoned tunic, and Deianeira the lonesome heifer and forlorn bird. Further, the diptych character of the play has been perhaps overstressed in the past: for throughout the early part of the play Heracles is constantly present through the image of him that is projected by Deianeira. the chorus, and Lichas. 19. "Ille Parum Cauti PectorLs Egit Opus," by William Robert Nethercut, Columbia University. In the opening poem of book 3, Propertius in- vokes the Muses as Pegasides (3.1.19). By thus alluding to the story of Pegasus. Hippocrene, and the jealous rivalry of Pierus' daughters, he estab- lishes water and strife as important motifs in this book. This paper considers the political signif- icance of Propertius' treatment of these themes in poems 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Numbers 1 and 3 contrast epic poetry and the g,ushing water whence Ennius drew inspiration to sing of strife with elegiac verse and the tranquiil lacwls from which poets such as Philitas of Cos moistened their lips. One of the types of flowing water mentioned in 3 is the sea, which, in 4 and 5, continues to be associated with strife in that it is equated with extension of empire and the fulfillment of a national destiny that is to be realized through alrma. In 7 the sea is the path over which men may strive after wealth, and in 9 seafaring imagery accom- panies a description of circumstances affording unlimited exercise of power. Conquest, wealth. and power are all items of which man can never have his fill; Instead of using restraint, he will continue, ever thirsting, in his pursuit after more and more. For Prometheus, when he formed the shapes of men, placed in their breasts an untamed, violent spirit, which, once unleashed, acknowledges no limits: Ille parum cauti pectoris egit opus. Corpora disponens mentem non vidit in arte: recta animi primum debuit esse via. (3.5.8-10) Did Propertius intend this message for Augustus? The essay concluides with an examination of evidence xwhich renders suich a thesis not only plausible, but convincing. 20. Livy and Augwstuts. 'by Hans Petersen, Uni- versity of Texas. It has been recognized previously that Livy not only refers explicitly to certain contemporary events, but also alludes implicitly to others. These allusions have been taken to show Livy's partisan- ship for Augustus. In order to broaden the basis for the discussion of this problem, the present paper assembles a -number of additional passages from Book I where Livy seems to allude to his own times: 7.8 (the nature of Augustus' power); 16.4 (senators murder the monarch); 16.5-8 (poor tes- timony for ruler's deification); 46.4-9 and 48.5-7 (monarch's consort has offended against pieta)W; 49.6-7 (Senate and fewer senators not consulted); 54.10 (general acquiescence in monarchy). Livy's allusions are subtle and polite; the contrast with Ovid is pointed out. From Livy's allusions it is concluded: (1) that Livy in Book I took cognisance of the political developments in his own days; (2) that Livy was by no means a blindly devoted fol- lower of Auguistus; (3) that the date generallv assigned to the composition of Book I (27-25 B.C.) is largely correct. 21. Mimesis in the Sophistes of Plato, by J. A. Philip, Trinity College, University of Toronto. It is generally recognized that in the Republic Plato uses the term mim6sis in two principal senses only loosely related to one another. These two uses, which we may call the restricted or dramatic use of Book III and the extended use of Book X, reap- pear in the final division of the Sophistes and are there related as species to genus. In the scheme or the division, divine as well as human mim&amp;8is finds a place and we see the reasons for some of the distinctions Plato makes. This division of the Sophistes enables us better to understand the ontological status Plato assigns to the products of mimesis and the meta- physical role of mimesis itself, especially in the Sophistes and the Timaetus. It also throws light on Plato's uise of mnimesis words in his Theory of Ideas. His two principal uses of the ternm ?nim6sis do not exhaust its uses and meanings in Plato, but they serve to clarify the role of the notion in his thought. 22. Cicero on Extra-Romant Speech. by Edwin S. Raniage, Indiana University. By Cicero's time the carefully fostered city re- finement, now labeled urbanitas, had led to the conviction on the part of the Roman gentleman that what originated in and emanated from his city was easily superior to anything outside. This attitude is reflected in Cicero's observations on the Latin speech of non-Romans. In Nis eyes there are</page><page sequence="6">86 THE CLASSICAL WORLD three extra-urban groups each of which has speech peculiarities: the rustics, Italians, and foreigners. Cicero criticizes the rustics for their broad, harsh, and heavy country accent. Certain urban orators such as L. Aurelius Cotta have dared to cultivate this rusticity in attempts to recreate the Roman speech of former times. In passing judg- ment, Cicero has Crassus tell us: "Our friend Cotta, as far as I am concerned, is not imitating the orators of olden time, but farm hands." The Italian orators whom we come upon in the Brutus are treated with greater respect, partly because they have been successful in their home towns and partly because Cicero has a fellow feeling with them. But even these speakers lack that certain tone of voice and pronunciation which flavors city speech. Cicero is more outspoken against the non-Italian foreigner. Just as the harsh rustic accent is to be avoided, so a peregrina insolentia must be shunned by the intelligent Roman. Thus the thick, heavy, slow way of speaking which is typical of the poets of Corduba and the coining of new Latin words on the analogy of foreign vocabulary come in for blunt criticism. To avoid such shortcomings, one muist learn his Latin not at some outlying center in Sicily, but in Rome. Cicero, then, is openly hostile to the rustic and foreigner alike. Why? In the first place, it is a natural and inherited hostility; secondly, Cicero felt that influences from these quarters were undermin- ing the time-honored urbanitas. 23. Aphrodite in the Theogony, by William Sale, Washington University. Theogony 154-206 can be divided into three sec- tions. The material in lines 154-87, the story of the castration of Uranus, has been traced by scholars to a Hurrian-Hittite myth, the tale of Kumarbis; I consider this a possible though not certain theory. Lines 201-6 are based upon the Dios Apate of Iliad 14. In them Hesiod defines Aphrodite as the god- dess of the act of love, but stresses her association with Himeros (sexual desire) and Eros, who, by virtue of his position as one of the primordial deities (lines 120-2), must be cbnsidered a god not only of desire but also of procreation. Lines 188-200 I trace first to a terracotta figur- ine found at Perachora, depicting the bearded Aphrodite rising from someone's severed genitals-- we do not know whose. Hesiod's myth must be Cyprian; the Perachora terracotta depicts a form of the goddess known to be Cyprian; hence I argue that the myth in the Theogoity goes back to a Cyprian cult, referred to by Philochorus, in which the bearded Aphrodite was worshiped by men wear- ing women's clothes. I hold that this transvestite ritual was a symbolic form of, or even a substitute for, castration, and that from this arose the notion that the goddess was born of severed genitals. When Hesiod composed 154-206, he had before him a tradition that Aphrodite was Uranus' daugh- ter (probably by a normal, or else unspecified means of begetting); he may have known a story of Uranus' castration; he did know that the bearded Aphrodite was thought to be born of severed geni- tals. And he had the radically different tradition of Homer, in which Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and was most emphatically not bearded. He wove this material together so as to preserve the Homeric concept and use the Cyprian myth. By this myth he was able to enrich his own association of Aphrodite with procreation, with fertility. 24. Two Problems int Roman Love Elegy: Ovid's Corinna and Romantic Love, by J. P. SuLllivan, University of Texas. Problems of literary method abound in the dis- cussion of Roman elegy. About Ovid's Corinna two theses may be distinguished: (a) that she was a real person like Catullus' Lesbia, (b) that she is a fictitious character compounded from literary themes and/or Ovid's minor liaisons. There is no internal or external evidence which can resolve this factual question and supporters of the theses must use subjective evidence based on the 'sincerity' or 'insincerity' of the Amores. The disagreement seems irresolvable: such evidence can- not settle such a problem. The debate is miscon- ceived, but those critics who have objected have not substituted adequate criteria for judging Ovid's po- etry, but merely urged that he writes a different sort of poetry from earlier elegists. The disagree- ment about Corinna and the evidence used is really a disguised critical reaction to Ovid, valuable as evidence for the common reader's reaction. Some critics of ancient love poetry assert that the ancients had no conception of romantic love: love was sensual gratification or deplorable mad- ness. The Courtly Love of the troubadours intro- duced true romantic love, which contrasts sharply with the classical attitude to love. But the elegists run counter to philosophical and social theory that deplored all passion of this sort: the evidence shows they deplore love when unhappy and delight in it when happy (as moderns do). There is no one classical attitude to love. To have preconceptions about the sensibility we must find in elegy is to abandon the critic's task of reacting freely to what he finds without preconceptions. It is tentatively suggested that Catullus and Propertius may be des- cribed as romantic: Ovid is a return to more stan- dard attitudes to love-arte regendus amor. 25: Repetition and Irony: Horace, Odes 2.188, by Hilburn Womble, Duke University. In a recent study, Prof. Helmbold has shown that there are many instances of word repetition both between and within the Odes, aside from incidence of anaphora. He questions whether the fact of iteration should constitute cause for sus- picion or emendation of the text. This study exam- ines the artistic performance of repetition in a single poem to investigate its esthetic function, which is seen to be one of insistent recall. As such, repetition is an integral component of the poem's structure. The second occurrence effects an inevit- able re-evaluation of the preceding occurrence. which enlarges the reference and adds a dimension to the first. This furnishes a basis for irony through inversion by compelling a comparison with the word's own history in the microcosm of the poem. 26. Hesiod's Fable, by Lloyd W. Daly, University of Pennsylvania. The fable imbedded in Hesiod's Works and Days has not received a satisfactory interpretation. It is here argued that analysis of the fable, careful</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 87 attention to its context, and comparison with Homeric use of the simile show that its sole point is as an illustration of hybris. Hesiod attempted to make this point clear in line 271. The details of the fable and its moral have no more special signifi- cance for Hesiod than comparable details in some of the Homeric similes have for the purposes of the comparison which evokes the simile.</page></plain_text>
