<plain_text><page sequence="1">A POSITION ON PREDATOR MANAGEMENT ROBERT A. McCABER Department of Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin, Madison EDWARD L. KOZICKY, Conservation Department, Winchester-Western Division Olin, East Alton, Illinois Abstract: This paper recognizes the need to control predators in some cases and sets forth ways in which control can be exercised without gready disrupting other organisms in the ecosystem concerned. Not all the suggestions of the Leopold Committee (Leopold 1964) have been put into practice. A limited assessment is made and a recommendation put forth that any committee (namely the Leopold commit- tee) be held active for an extended penod after its report is submitted to evaluate the results of its pro- posals to the unit of government that charged the committee. Two predator control cases are ex- amined: the sea lamprey (Petromyzon ma7inus) problem and the coyote (Canis latrans)-sheep problem. The basic responsibility of the federal government to engage in the killirlg of predators is dhallenged on the basis of a conflict of interest in resource management. NVe recommend that the U.S. government di- vest itself of the field operation in predator control and instead act as the agency that legally regu- lates and enforces all aspects of predator control methodology. 382 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 CLARK, F.

We have hope, but little optimism, iat mankind will discard irrational and emo- tional hostility toward predators and sub- stitute a scientific position on their manage- ment. But to people other than biologists or ecologists, the word predator has long meant something malicious the wicked preying upon the good. We were engaged for 5 years as two members of a three-man editorial team for a subcommittee of the Agricultural Board for the National Academy of Science, in preparing a bulletin Vertebrate Pests: Prob- lems arBd Control (McCabe 1970). The dif- ficulties of the effort were many and varied and did not allow for the development of a position statement on predator control, and predator control comprises a major com- ponent of vertebrate control. What follows is an assessment and position statement on predator control that was, in the main, rejected by the Academy as being beyond the charge of the (sub) committee. How- ever, five of the nine members of the sub- committee felt that an assessment and posi- tion statement on predator control was within the committee purview and neces- sary for perspective and an understanding of basic issues. A position statement on any aspect of human endeavor must, among other quali- ficationsn be objective and free from bias. In no oier effort in the field of wildlife management are these criteria of greater importance than in the program of predator control. The history of predator control in the United States, up to and including the present, has not always been either objec- tive or free from bias. A predator is an animal that kills another and more often than not eats its prey. If the prey species is abundant and of no economic or recreational value, the public does not become excited except perhaps to regard the predator as a repugnant killer. Repugnant or not, a predator must kill in order to survive, a detail often overlooked by the layman who feels revulsion at the sight of blood and body parts. To manage any animal group implies efforts to increase, decrease, or to hold stable the group in question. In the ease of predators, the greatest emphasis is usually placed on reduction of numbers and only rarely on increasing or maintaining pred- ator populations. The role of this paper is to develop a position statement on predator management by assessing and bringing into perspective the data, events, agencies and organizations, and occasionally individuals involved in or concerned with the control of predators. Many persons contributed directly and indirectly to the ideas presented here on the general subject of predator control. From each we learned something. In par- ticular, the National Academy of Science Subcommittee on Vertebrates as Pests helped shape our thinking. J. J. Hickey, Marie S. McCabe, and John Madson helped with manuscript suggestions. We are grate- ful to all who offered opinions and advice regardless of whether they agreed or dis- agreed with our positions as presented. PREDATION Predation as a natural biological phe- nomenon is usually regarded by scientists and the informed public in two ways: the first reaetion is philosophical and the second is practical. Philosophical The philosophical position is one in which there is no anthropomorphic issue of moral- ity when one animal kills another, however gory the proeess. Indeed, the skills of the hunter in searehing, finding, stalking, strug-</page><page sequence="3">384 JournaC of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 gling, dispatching, and consuming are often biologically interesting and aesthetically awe-inspiring. This would hold for the stooping of the peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus), the pack hunting of wolves (Canis lupus), or the race for survival be- tween a Thomson's gazelle ( Gazella thom- sonii) and a cheetah ( Acinenyx jubatus). There are those who see beauty in these relationships imposed by evolution on the animals and the environments of which they are a part, even when such relationships place one animal in the role of predator and the other the prey. Education has, and hopefully it will continue to have, great impact in developing an inner satisfaction in seeing or just in knowing that there exist in our culture places where native animals can remain wild and free, and where, on occasion, they should rate a higher priority than the socioeconomic schemes of men. The philosophical approach appeals to man's ethical and aesthetic values. The values are no less real than bread and butter. Practical The practical or pragmatic reaction is essentially a "what will it do for me" atti- tude toward predator management and can be divided into three categories. Economics. Most emphasis must be placed on the economics-oriented concern since it is most widespread (essentially in the western U. S.), publicized, costly, and politically conscious. There are numerous small-scale predator problems east of the Mississippi, the majority of which can be solved by individual effort and that require, for example, no broad-gauge program of trapping or poisoning. In the West, how- ever, particularly in the areas where sheep are grazed, coyotes become the major pred- ator. Although there are predator problems in agriculture and cattle raising, and animal depredatiorl in horticulture and forestry, the confrontation of sheep and coyotes dwarfs all others. Recreation. Man, the consummate pred- ator, is covetous of all other creatures that impinge on his predatory prerogative. Thus, even though his predatory instincts are often recreational, as in fishing and hunting, he protects his potential prey by efforts to eliminate competition from other predators. The extensive kill of predators, raptors, and fish-eating birds in particular ( at game farms and fish hatcheries, for example ), has on occasion been shameful in both method and magnitude. Deer, waterfowln and up- land game birds have also been protected at times by programs designed to eliminate predation by nonhuman predatory competi- tors. The benefits from such protection are limited, if not doulbtful. Welfare. Vertebrate predation with re- gard to human health and safety (welfare ) is indirect but obviously real. Two prime examples concern animals that are potential vectors during rabies epidemics and birds that endanger aircraft. Efforts to control the former are of questionable value, and control of the latter is under investigation in both the United States and Ganada. ENDANGERED SPECIES There are a number of endangered spe- cies of predators, some of which are recog- nized as endangered by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife ( BSFW ) . When predator-control operations fail to be selec- tive, the endarlgered species are in even greater jeopardy. The Director of the BSFW, in assessing such a situation, replied before a Congressional hearing (U. S. House of Representatives 1966:48 ) that '&lt;our pro- gram therefore is designed so that it will recognize our responsibility to help out the rancher who needs the help, but also to guarantee the American public that these</page><page sequence="4">POSITION ON PREDATOR MANAGEMENT * McCabe atl d Kozicky 385 forms [large predators] of wildlife will con- tinue to exist." However, he also stated in the same report (p. 48) that "with respect to predator animals, we would only have them [population estimates] really for an animal like the black bear or the grizzly. \Ale do not have at this time a good popula- tion estimate for coyotes, for example. For the other predators, the mountain lion [Felis concolor], I think this would be subject to a great deal of guesswork, also." Wolves, and the red wolf (Canis niger) in particular, doubtlessly also fall into this class. One wonders, since there are no population censuses or usable estimates, and in the presence of a predator-control pro- gram, whether even the BSFW can or should be responsible for "guaranteeing that large predators will continue to exist." CONTROL DECISION The initial decision to invoke control is a legal matter, and even here, responsibility for such decisions is not clear. Nonmigratory predators are under the jurisdiction of the individual states. Migratory predators (for example, eagles) are the responsibility of the federal government, as are all predators on lands 11eld by the government. The efforts of the federal government do not stop here. The eadre of specialists-mem- bers of the former Branch of Predator and Rodent Control and now the Division of Wildlife Services ( within the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife )- who trap and poison are available to private land- owners who may request assistance. De- mands on the Bureau range from eontrol of rodents, birds, skunks, foxes, mountain lions, bobeats (Lynx rufus), and coyotes to usolves, often overlapping the authority and respon- sibility of other federal and state agencies. The result has been that existing organiza- tions and programs for controlling verte- brate anirnals were complicated almost beyond belief. The aggregate control, spearheaded by the Division of Wildlife Services ( DWS ), has been unwarranted overcontrol of predators ( Leopold 1964 ) and of the large carnivores in particular. THE LEOPOLD REPORT Because of the overcontrol and other shortcomings, the government found itself in the eye of the storm. In 1963, Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall asked his Ad- visory Board on Wildlife Management to address itself to "predator and rodent con- trol in the United States." The end result of the efforts of the Advisory Board was the Leopold Report (Leopold 1964). Two Tenets Two basic tenets were adopted by the Leopold Committee (Leopold 1964:29) as the basis for its recommendations: C'1) All native animals are resources of inherent interest and value to the people of the United States. Basic government policy therefore should be one of husbandry of all forms of wildlife. "2) At the same time, local population control is an essential part of a management policy7 where a species is causing significant damage to other resources or crops, or where it endangers human health or safety. Control should be limited strictly to the troublesome species, preferably to the troublesome individuals, and in any event to the localities where substantial damage or danger exists." The Leopold Committee (Leopold 1964: 29 ) was unanimous in the opinion that (predator and rodent) "control as actually practiced today is considerably in excess of the amount that can be justified in terms of the total public interest." This is one of the most significant statements in the entire report, because it focuses attention on the</page><page sequence="5">386 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 reasons for the excess, the meffiodology resulting in excess, the biosocial meaning of excessive control, and the responsibility for guiding a program of excessive control. Demonstroted Need As a prime antidote to this untenable situation, the Leopold Gommittee ( Leopold 1964:44 ) recommended, and the DWS accepted (Berryman 1966), the provision that there be a "clearly demonstrated need" for control before the DWS would partic- ipate. Ideally, this is an excellent criterion for goveinmental participation when any pri- vate enterprise is in trouble and deserves help. In this case, we feel that such a criterion is virtually impossible to achieve because of the sheer subjective nature of the judgments required. Demonstrated need also assumes that judgments can be made rapidly, as they often must be if remedial or prophylactic measures are to be effective. On February 2, 1966, the Director of the BtSFW said ( U. S. House of Representatives 1966:47), in answer to a query as to what demonstrated need for control would be, "But, to come now to these considerations which we face most commonly, and which involve the relationship of predators to agri- culture, here the demonstrated need is basically related to the characteristics of a coyote or a group of coyotes which have shown a predilection for preying upon a particular rancher's sheep flock or calf crop. C'If he is being bothered regularly, and with obvious losses to the extent ffiat, in the judgment of our man on the ground, our supervisor, it requires some assistance, then we would consider ffiis a demonstrated need. "Now, we have not as of yet, and remem- ber that we are still in the growing pain period of this whole program, come up with any quantified estimates of a demonstrated need. It is a very difficult, involved ques- tion, but it is one that we recognize has to be solved ultimately, if we are to put iis whole program on the plane of respon- sibility whieh we believe it deserves.'&gt; We agree eompletely that the question is involved and difficult, and we agree also that quantified estimates of a denzonstrated need are required to put the control pro- gram on a plane of responsibility that it deserves. However, in 1988 ( and 1969 ), 5 years after the Leopold Report was sub- mitted, we looked in vain for any objeetive eriteria that would produee the sought-after quantification. In lieu, therefore, of any objective stan- dards, the predator control &lt;'man on the ground" was and, as far as we know, still is rendering judgment on demonstrated need. These supervisors, many of whom were old PARC men and whose earlier aetivities of overcontrol prompted the Leo- pold intrestigation, are now asked to be abjective in assessing the bother that coy- otes create. Major Recommendotions The Report went on to condeinn and also approve parts of ie government's activities in eontrol. Also discussed were the damage caused by predators; the use of tlle very lethal poison 1080 ( sodium monofluoroace- tate ), particularly secondary poisoning; rabies outbreaks; rodent and bird depreda- tion and eontrol, particularly the role of the golden eagle (Aqui1s chrysaetos) on sheep; and research on control meiods. From deliberations on these and asso- ciated aspects of l:he problem came four pertinent recommendations: 1. The appointment lof a predator and rodent eonWol board advisory to the Secre- tary of the Interior. 2. Improvements in predator- and rodent- eontrol operations: (a) explicit criteria to</page><page sequence="6">POSITION ON PREDATOR MANAGEMENT * McCabe and Kozicky 387 was both criticism (Etter 1966) and progress ( Gottschalk 1967 ) . An advisory board ( the Leopold Committee) can set the stage for efficient operation, but unless there is built into the program a system of feedback to test the implementation of the recommenda- tions and to make improving alterations, private watchdog organizations serve as the only evaluators. There is both merit and discord in such an arrangement: when government abrogates responsibility for program-evaluation to outside sources, it leaves itself vulnerable to public criticism. HOlDING AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE A far better use of an advisory committee, particularly to an agency responsible for animal control, would be to hold the mem- bers ready to evaluate and adjust committee recommendations, once field results are ob- tained in response to the recommendations. In some cases, advisory committees move from one problem to another without having an opportunity to check the functioning of recommended action on any problem. If there is no vehicle for feedback, the public throughmilitantgroups willreact strongly, sometimes with bias, and virtually always with emotion. This is not to say that such reactions are without merit. A case in point is the use of poison bait (1080) stations in the western United States. The Leopold Report ( Leopold 1964:35 ) recommended one such station per town- ship as reasonable and adequate for coyote control. Etter ( 1968 and personal com- munication) presents a situation in north- western Colorado that flaunts the recom- mendation by using from 1 to 15 stations per township. In a circumstance such as this, the major field problems should be returned to the Advisory Committee itself for reassessment and alternative action. In this manner, the chief administrator could obtain maximum guide control deeisions, (b) continued co- operative programs to be maintained with other agencies, (c) proof of control need (documentation), (d) extension trapper programs replacing bounty schemes, and (e) flying squads of control agents to be nzaintained to cope with rabies outbreaks ( in the eastern United States) . 3. Greatly amplified researeh program for specific controls and nonlethal control devices. 4. Legal controls to regulate the use of poisons in control operations and to prevent shipment of such poisons to foreign coun- tries lacking adequate controls. The Report (Leopold 1964:47) concluded with the notation that control programs should be guided by real need and scientific management. It is not our purpose to analyze the Report, but an obvious obstacle to work- ability will be how to prove real need by those seeking federal assistance in the field. There are as yet no published guidelines to eliminate or minimize subjective judgment and its attendant biases-another omission in the scientific approach to predator man- agement. The Secretary of the Interior himself tended to limit the impact of the recommendations by referring to the Leo- pold Report as a "general guidepost for Department policy." The Report might well have been a policy mandate! It would be foolhardy for the public, or even for militant conservationists, to expect guidepost suggestions to alter promptly the programs of an entrenched agency with personnel many of whom have limited scientific training. A central administration can make abrupt shifts, but, at the field level, the current of public tradition and operational habit allow for no such rapid response ( Hall 1966: 105 ) . After almost 7 years of the neu) look in federal predator and rodent control, there</page><page sequence="7">388 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 benefit from the board of specialists best able to appraise the entire problem. Com- mittees that recommend and then are dis- solved find it difficult to determine whether or not their guidance is adequate. Again, we find a lack of follow-through on the first recommendation of the Leopold Gommittee. This recommendation is one of the steps within the scientific approach to predator management the appointment of an Advisory Committee (to the Secretary of the Interior) on Predator Control. Such a committee could establish protocol for control measures and program responsi- bility, and provide for a feedback to the committee so that the control program could be modified or otherwise implemented. PREPARING FOR THE FIELD PROGRAM The nature of control programs makes the determination of proper field action difficult. In some cases, for example, when a favorable report on demonstrated need is received, the control required may be drastic and immediate in order to be effec- tive. To what extent will alleged urgency play in decision making? Some pro;blems can be averted, minimized, or eliminated by a carefully worked out long-range pro- gram in predator management. Will such protracted programs be accepted by those who press for immediate removal? Control methodology will undoubtedly differ from situation to situation; thus, not only will skill be required to say if a predatory situa- tion deserves action, but also to say how, and what kind of action is needed. There are specific requirements that we feel should be part of any predator manage- ment project: 1. Define the predator problem and dem- onstrate the need for control, objectively and fully. Although an obvious and logical first step, the problems and needs are seldom well defined. 2. Identify the predator and prey species conclusively. Too often a predator is only suspected. 3. Identify other species and conditions contributing to the predator problem. 4. Know the salient aspects of the pred- ator's life history and evaluate its strengths and weaknesses. 5. Investigate, where control is necessary, all possible direct and indirect controls as well as any practical alternatives to control. 6. Employ only thlose controls that are specific for, or can be applied selectively to, the target predator. All possible precau- tiOIlS must be considered to avoid or mini- mize hazards to other fauna and flora and contamination or alteration of waters and soils. 7. Submit to the proper auiority, for review and decisions, a full report on Inajor predator problems, including a protocol for prograna responsibility and control mea- sures. For example, the U. S. Government llOW has a Federal Committee oll Pest Con- trol whose charter provides that the Com- mittee will review control programs for invertebrate, vertebrate, and plant pests from the standpoint of effectivenessr eco- nomic impact, and of hazards to human health, to livestock and crops, to fish and wildlife, and other elements of the environ- ment. Based on its review, the Comrnittee recommends to the heads of departments or agencies any necessary naodifications that best serve the pllblic interest. 8. Explore fully the question of funding for the entire program to make certain that the action taken is equitable) effective, and in keeping with sound conservation, if a decision for control is made by a review group. 9. Organize and exercise a system of feed- back through reports and through confer- ences among the control group, the respon- sible agency, and the review committee so</page><page sequence="8">POSITION ON PREDATOR NIANAGEMENT * McCabe and Kozicky 389 that the control program can be modified or otherwise implemented to accomplish its purpose promptly, safely, and economically. Few of the predator control programs have included most of the steps listed above. Many predator-control operations in the past, for example, have seriously violated the basic steps: the problems were not objectively defined; the predators were not positively identified with the problem; non- specific or inappropriate toxicants were applied, some resulting in contamination of the environment; operational plans were not referred to competent authority for review and decisions; or inadequate funding com- promised success. TWO PREDATOR-CONTROL PROGRAMS Two classic problems in vertebrate pest control illustrate some of the credit and debit aspects of the national effort. The Sea Lamprey Problem The sea lamprey in the Great Lakes is a fine example of a recent, large-scale pred- ator problem, and the evolution of a control program for lampreys in accordance with a basic scientific approach deserves some discussion here. The collapse of the lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) populations in Lakes Huron and Michigan in the late 1940's and early 1950's was viewed with alarm by biologists, fishermen, legislatorsn and the public. There was no unanimity within or among the groups on the cause of the lake trout's dis- appearance. Investigations by state and federal con- servation agencies from 1948 on positively identified the predator. Concurrent and basic studies on the sea lamprey proved that it was capable of and indeed was prey- ing heavily on lake trout (Applegate 1950, Lennon 1954, Parker and Lennon 1956 ) . The lake trout at first bore the brunt of the lamprey predation because of their favor- able size, and their preferzed habitat within the lakes coincided with that of the lam- preys. Also, as later studies showed, the odor of lake trout is especially attractive to sea lampreys ( Kleerekoper 1969:140 ) . Once the highly vulnerable lake trout had disappeared, lamprey predation was ex- tended to the larger species of food and game fishes in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, causing severe economic losses. After identifying the predator species and unraveling its life history, how does one cope with the predation problem in a situa- tion encompassing thousands of square miles of international waters, thousands of miles of coastline, hundreds of spawning streams, one province and eight states, and two federal governments? The Great Lakes Fishery Commission was formed, staffed, and funded as the ultimate biopolitical instrument for assessing and correcting the predator problem. This Commission was established by the United States and Canada in 1955 after about 7 years of deliberation among pro- vincial, state, and federal governments. Funded through the Departments of State of the two nations on a pro rata basis, the Commission has two major responsibilities: to develop coordinated programs of research in the Great Lakes to support maxinaum sustained productivity of fish stocks, and to formulate and implement a program to eradicate or minimize sea lamprey popula- tions in the Great Lakes. The Commission has been capable, ag- gressive, and prestigious. It immediately concerned itself with lamprey control and awarded contracts for research, in the United States and Canada, which con- tributed to the development of a selective lampricide ( TF1M = 3-trifluormethyl-4- nitrophenol). The toxicant is effective in</page><page sequence="9">390 Journal of Wildlife Managenlent, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 killing lamprey larvae of all year-classes, O through 7+ years, residing in the bottom materials of spawning streams ( Baldwin 1968 ) . The Commission also supported the application of AC-DC electrified weirs at the mouths of streams for capture of lam- preys moving upstream to spawn. The initial large-scale applications of chemical and electrical controls were de- voted to Lake Superior, with excellent results and in keeping with a scientifically based timetable. Control programs began several years later on Lake Michigan and more recently on Lake Huron. As lampreys were reduced in Lakes Superior and Mich- igan, long-term efforts to restore lake trout, brown trout (Salmo trutta), and rainbow trout (S. gatrdnerii) (steelheads) and to establish coho salmon ( Oncorhynchos tschawytscha ) and chinook salmon ( O. ktsutch) were started. The response of the stocked salmonids has been spectacular- up to a point. The sport fisheries are thriv- ing and are worth millions of dollars to the States. However, the objective of restoring naturally propagating populations of lake trout is not being achieved) because residual populations of lampreys are preying heavily on the fish before they become sexually mature at 6 or 7 years of age. And the Commission now has inadequate funds to locate and control these residual popula- tions. Thus, the predator problem persists, at a lower but still dangerous level, threaten- ing fish restoration and the valuable sport fisheries, and postponing resumption of commercial fisheries. There are lessons in predator control to be learned from the sea lamprey program. Predator-prey relationships and control measures were investigated by state, pro- vincial, and federal conservation agencies with an exemplary degree of cooperation and coordination. An international commis- sion was established by two nations to further the research and manage the control of the predator. However, despite a scien- tific approach by ie competent biopolitical commission, the all-important funds conae from legislative bodies- and legislators today are subject to frequent pleas for research monies for many other longterm and expensive biological problems. 7e must recognize that competition for legis- lative attention and support is keen and that the best of scientific timetables rnay relate poorly with annual funding processes. Hence, as outlined earlier, the problem of an inadequate budget for a sufficient number of years could prevent ie lamprey control program from being a success. Let us hope that this outstanding predator- control program will not be thwarted by a lack of funds at the 11th hour. The CoyotSheep Problem No predator-control problem has attracted more attention, chuined up more human emotions, aroused more political furor, and demanded more unwarranted expenditures than the one involving the predators that prey on livestock ( cattle, horses, sheep, swine, and poultry). When all the polite considerations are stripped from the controversy of livestock depredation, iere remains the classic con- frontation of the coyote as the predator and the sheep as the prey. All socioeconomic conflicts of other species scale down from this end of the predator-prey spectrum. The biology, sociology, economics, and legislation of predator control are at once magnified and exemplified in an unresolved impasse. To assess this chronic difficulty, the fol- lowing facts and positions ( McCabe 1970 ) must be understood and placed in proper perspective: 1. In some cases, the cost of predator control for sheep exceeds the on-the-hoof</page><page sequence="10">POSITION ON PREDATOR MANAGEMENT * l\I cCaDe and Kozicky 391 10. In 196S, it cost the government and cooperative agencies $5,614&gt;806 for the predator-control program alone. In the same year, 90,236 coyotes were killed) along with other predators taken accidentally or purposefully in the process. How many of the coyotes taken were nonsheep predators is unknown. From this potpourri of difficult-to-obtain facts, gro-ws a battery of charges and coun- tercharges, one group seeking financial aid to kill flesh-eaters in the nanle of local economy and the oier seeking protection for the predators under the banner of national conservation. There has been limited scientific ap- proach to predator management within ie sheep-coyote controversy7 and certainly the approach has not been commensurate rvith the magnitude of the problem. All possible direct and indirect controls have not been considered. And although control efforts have been substantial, they have not always been specific forn or applied selectively to, target predators. A basic scientific premise for the control of predators (or any animal) on the broad front where they conflict with human endeavor is not easy to formulate, and even the best premise will meet with objections and have obvious omissions. Nonetheless, any control measure physical, chemical, or biological must be specific for the aniina] or animals involved, not be detrirnental to other organisms in the biota including man, and be morally and socially acceptable to the scientists who must plan or guide the control effort. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS Our experiences in attempting to develop a scientific approach to predator control can be summarized as follows: value of the livestock killed by predators (Leopold 1964). It could be argued that had no control been exertedn the losses would have been great. Until data on this aspect are available, no assessment can be made. 2. The federal govemment subsidizes the sheep industry by predator control; by allowing sheep and goats to graze on public lands; through tariffs on wool, woolens, and on lamb and mutton; and by incentive pay- ments to wool producers. 3. Sheep raising is of two kinds: as an animal crop in diversified farming (usually in the eastern half of the country) or as free-ranging sheep as single-crop ranching (in the western United States). It is the rancher who requests predator control. 4. Claims of losses caused by predators (including losses from eagles) cannot be accurately determined, in most cases. Those that have been verified are usually far fewer than claimed by stockmen (U.S. Senate 1962) . 5. Not all coyotes (or eagles) take sheep. Coyotes scavenge on carcasses of sheep dead or dying from numerous natural causes. 6. The use of herders and lambing sheds is apparently too expensive for most sheep raisers, but losses could be cut considerably by this change in husbandry. 7. Methods of predator control are at times excessive and nonspecific, and iey are leveled against species that are part of a national natural resource complex. 8. Most lethal poisons are available to the nonprofessional to use as he may in predator control. 9. The National Wool Growers Associa- tion is the most active agency promoting the use of federal funds for predator killing; the Defenders of Wildlife and ie National Audubon Society are the mainstays in pro- tecting target and nontarget species from excessive predator control.</page><page sequence="11">392 Journal of Wildlife Management7 Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 The Leopold Committee assessed the predator control program on a broad front and ultimately concentrated its investiga- tions on the endeavors of the federal gov- ernment, in particular the Predator and Rodent Control section of the BSFW. The Committee Report (Leopold 1964:29) stated that all animals have inherent in- terest and values to U. S. citizenry, and be- cause local control may be required? "The issue is how to sharpen the tools of control so that they hew only where cuts are fully justified." Within the limits of such a pur- view, the excellent Leopold Report resulted. A far more fundamental question was avoided, namely: Should the BSFW be responsible for t1ie actual control of precla- tory animals ( other than on federal lands ) ? In our considered judgment, it should not. This charge is outdated and s!hould be removed. A phasing-out program would eliminate the need for a service staff in the field, whose activities were the cause of some public indignation and considerable administrative concern that promoted the need for professional investigation ( namely, the Leopold Report). In short, the federal government should divest itself of predator-control activity and put a professional staff and budget into naonitoring and enforcing control programs undertaken by private business interests. Governmental concern would be exercised in stringent supervision over methods and nlaterials. The need to develop both pro- gram and field operatilon under federal law must then fall to the private sector. Irl such a situation, the government would have control but would not itself participate in the day-to-day work program. To be sure, this kind of a shift in organization, attitude, and legal responsibility may be difficult to achieve, but not so difficult that natural resources should suffer byla defaulting. Nematodes and rootworms attack plant field crops, but no one expects the govern- ment to employ, at the expense of all, men and equipment to help the farmer in this battle; yet his monetary losses are just as real as those of sheepmen and others claim- ing losses from predation. Regardless of what is ultimately done in assigning predator-control responsibility, federal programs must be divorced from private interests and financial participation. When overall costs of predator control are about 60 percent contributed by nonfederal sources, it is unrealistic to assume that private interests would not have precedence over national interests. This is the very impression one gets from reading the Hear- ings on Predatory Mammals ( U. S. House of Representatives 1966). Instead of putting federal funds and personnel on tlle progranls of wild animal destruction, such monies might be used to help subsidize programs of domestic animal husbandry ( for examplen proper lambing conditions to reduce or eliminate predation ) that would lessen or even abolish the need to remove predators by poisoning or trap- ping. When the cost of government protection exceeds the losses of privately owned live- stock ( Leopold 1964:33 ) &gt; it seems to us that an insurance program of some kind to protect the livestock rancher is in order even if the government itself must act in lieu of private enterprise. Of particular concern are bona fide depredations hy rare or endangered species. Here governmell t payment of loss protects the private owners of the prey and the public as owners of an endangered resource. In Department of Interior programs, where committees or advisory boards made up of professional personnel make policy or administrative recommendations, a built- in feedback system should be used. The advisory body would be held intact and</page><page sequence="12">POSITION ON PREDATOR SIANAGEMENT N McCabe and Kozicky 393 functional during the initial period of imple- mentation of its recommendations. Such a system would allow for a testing period in the field so that at least one readjustment could be made in those recommendations that prove to be untenable, not feasible, or inadequate. Had such a feedback system been employed, the resurgence of the pred- ator controversy might have lDeen elimi- nated, and the call for a congressional hearing, only 2 years after the Leopold Report, in all probability would have been unnecessary. Any control measure, however and by whomever administered, must be justified and the methods or materials, or both, made .specific to the offending animal (or ani- mals ). The control must in no way be harmful to nontarget species and the en- virollment, including man, and it should be in keeping with the basic principles of conservation. In addition, control must be guided by ethical and aesthetic considera- tions as well as by economic values; and at all times by a rationale supported by scien- tific data. Delay is the enemy of any report, and our contribution for the Academy bulletin and this paper have suffered from delay. C:hanges of program, attitude, or policy affecting the various aspects of predator control may have occurred since the writing of this paper for the Midwest Wildlife Predator Control Symposium in 1969. The passive erosion occasioned by delay does not, however, affect the basic tenets of this report. All published reports are history. We apologize for any gross omissions. I N RETROSPECT Premeditated control of animals is a pre- rogative that only man can exercise. He must do so for his health, economy, comfort, and recreation. In a period when the tech- nology of the Atomic Age has overrun its ability to provide adequate safeguards against its own too much, we must reconcile the conflict between man and other verte- brates. Here, too, technology has provided control methods without adequate safe- guards for nonpest species, and in sonae cases for man himself. In such situations, we are required to make value judgments on the confrontations with other vertebrate coinhabitors of world environments. Judgments of this kind are not rendered swift and easy by obvious cause-and-effect relationships. Many man-animal interac- tions are multifaceted in cause, effect, and ultimate solution. Problems are often ill- defined ecologically, legally, and socially. To understand the difficulty of effecting ecologically sound relief from pest situa- tions, one needs only to be aware of the roles that habit and tradition play in mod- erating and altering the effectiveness of scientific developments. Extrapolation from one geographic, cultural, or political area to another in control methodology is a value judgment in itself. It would be naive in the extreme to assume that western stockmen have no predator problems. Our position debates current programs and questions the role of the involvement of the federal government. And our concern is for the predators as a natural resource that should be managed, adjusted for, protected when threatened with extinction, as well as controlled, when the case is justified. We in the United States are well endowed with diverse talents to appraise our pest problems from the viewpoint of many dis- ciplines. In addition, our technological society can make available the sophisticated methodology needed to cope with most predator situations. Our basic requirement for compatible control of animals is to give order and system to what we know and have, so that</page><page sequence="13">394 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 safety and efficiency can be achieved in the process. Long-range benefits and safe- guards must take precedence over the im- mediate and expedient treatment of animals in pest situations. Modern civilized man assumes that his hypersensitivity to pest situations will al- ways be resolved in his favor through tech- nology, laws, or force. It is a false assump- tion. More and more, as the usable space for livelihood decreases through population growth, we will be required to live with our self-imposed pest situations. To do otherwise may be impossible, for there will be few acceptable alternatives. Man is also the only animal with the capacity to exercise restraint through judg- ment, but this capacity will avail him noth- ing unless he understands and believes that all things wild and free have a place in the natural order. Control is a respon- sibility that denies this integrity for some animals at some times and places. If man takes this responsibility lightly, he may alter the natural order and indirectly threaten his own place in the unnatural order thus created. LITERATURE CITED APPLEGATE, V. C. 1950.
