<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEHAVIOUR OF NYMPHS OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA (FORSKAL) (ORTHOPTERA, ACRIDIDAE) IN A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO TEMPERATURE PREFERENCE by R. F. CHAPMAN 1) (Birkbeck College, London, U.K.) (With io Figures) (Rec. 20-VI-i964) INTRODUCTION Previous work on nymphs of Locusta migratoria L. (CHAPMAN, I955) suggested that their temperature preference might be altered by varying the conditions to which they had been subjected immediately before the experi- ment. Subsequently field work on the red locust, Nomadacris septemfasciata (Serville), pointed to the importance of preconditioning and change as factors governing more general aspects of behaviour (CHAPMAN, I959; I959a) and the need for a full laboratory investigation became apparent. As a result the series of experiments to be described was started in the hopes that temperature preference might be used as a measure of a preconditioning effect. This hope was not fulfilled, but a fairly thorough study of tempe- rature preference and the possible mechanisms responsible for the pheno- menon has been made. METHODS The apparatus used was designed by GUNN (I934) and is probably the most satisfactory of its kind with minimal variations in temperature across i) I am indebted to my friends at the Anti-Locust Research Centre for a great deal of help and in particular to Mr. A.

The whole apparatus was enclosed by screens painted white inside and was illuminated by a strip light running the full length of the apparatus about 2 ft above it. A flow of air of about 2 1./min. was maintained through the gradient from the hot end where the dew point was also measured. Except where the water content of the air was deliberately raised the dew point was about 6° C. Temperature measurements within the apparatus were made with copper! constantan thermocouples used in pairs: one to measure the floor tempera- ture, the other to measure the air temperature 5 mm above the floor. These rarely differed by as much as I° C and air and floor temperatures may in general be regarded as being the same. The apparatus took about 3 hr to stabilise with a gradient from about Io to 50° C. Increase in temperature along the gradient was almost linear except at temperatures above 40° C. The insects used in the experiments were second instar nymphs of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal). These were received as hatch- lings from the Anti-Locust Research Centre and subsequently reared in crowds in 12-1. cylindrical cages under constant conditions at 30° C with a relative humidity in the room of 35-45%. On the day before an experiment the locusts were given fresh food at Io.oohr. At I3.oohr individuals were transferred to 3 X I in. specimen tubes each containing a few blades of grass and with a perforated zinc top. These were then put into a humidity oven at 30° C and at a saturation deficit of about 20 mm Hg, conditions similar to those in the constant temperature room. By this treatment it was hoped that all the insects were in a fairly standard condition when the experiment started. Having them in 3 X I in. specimen tubes also facilitated their transfer to the gradient without handling. The humidity oven was programmed so that 3 hr before experiments were due to start it switched to the temperature and humidity at which it was desired to precondition the insects. Thus the first insects tested had been preconditioned under particular conditions for 3 hr, those tested at the end of the day had been in these conditions for about Io hr. Insects were put into the gradient through a hole in the roof at the centre (about 30° C) and each one was left in for 30 min. Its position in the gradient was noted at one-minute intervals and the results are expressed in terms of the percentage of time for which the insect was stationary at each temper- ature. Single individuals were used in most of the experiments because locusts are known to group and it is possible that this behaviour might in- fluence the results. However, some experiments were carried out with groups of ten locusts in the gradient. In this case each experiment lasted 5 hr and 284</page><page sequence="3">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA the distribution of the hoppers was recorded at 30 min. intervals. The results are expressed as a frequency distribution relative to temperature. KENNEDY (I939) in a discussion of the activity of Schistocerca in the field presents this in terms of an interaction between a positive and a nega- tive thermokinesis. With slowly changing temperature, such as was employed by HUSSEIN (I937) in his experiments, there is a continual increase in activity with temperature; with a rapidly changing temperature, such as KENNEDY used and as occurs in an experimental temperature gradient with marked spatial temperature differences, a negative thermokinesis becomes dominant in a certain range of temperature. KENNEDY concludes that the negative response could only be dominant between 20° and 40° C with the positive response becoming dominant below and above these tempera- tures. The negative response is not dominant below 20° C because the insects do not move sufficiently to encounter big temperature differences, and because changes have less effect at the lower end of the temperature scale. In the experiments in a temperature gradient insects were put into the gradient at about 30° C and were free to move rapidly to lower temperatures. Nevertheless they rarely came to rest below 30° C so that KENNEDY'S first suggestion does not hold. It appears that below about 30° C (rather than 20° C as KENNEDY found) the effect of rapid temperature change is less marked so that only above this and below the temperature at which the positive thermokinesis increases steeply (40-50°) is a negative response to temperature likely to be observed. The range in which this negative response to temperature occurs is usually referred to as the preferred temperature range. 'Preferred' is often objected to because of its anthropomorphic implications and also because it perhaps suggests a directed movement into this zone. CHAPMAN (I955) has shown that the movement is not a directed one and there is, of course, no question of any conscious preference. Other terms have been suggested. FRAENKEL &amp; GUNN (I940) give 'indifference zone' and 'eccritic temperature'. The former is misleading because this is not a zone of indifference to temperature, and eccritic temperature (meaning 'picked out temperature') is little improvement on 'preferred temperature'. Aziz (1958) has used 'zone of minimum activity' largely in connection with humidity responses, but this is not really suitable here because the lowest levels of activity are usually related to low temper- ature. Rather than. invent a new term it seems best to retain 'preferred tem- perature' since this is widely used. It is understood that this does not imply any conscious selection on the part of the insect, nor does it have any impli- cations with regard to movement into the zone. The preferred temperature 285</page><page sequence="4">R. F. CHAPMAN zone is the range of temperature, normally in the upper part of the active temperature range of the insect, in which a negative thermokinesis may, under some circumstances, become dominant. In discussing temperature preference a difficulty arises in interpreting and comparing different results. In the tests on individual insects nymphs which had been reared together from the time of hatching were used in each experiment. Thus their past history was as much the same as it was practi- cable to make it, but in spite of this the individual preferences of Io nymphs tested on the same day, taking the modal values as the preferences, were only rarely within a 5° C range; usually the range was much greater than this. Further, in the course of a single experiment a nymph might change its position so that its apparent preference was altered by several degrees. Consequently the preferred temperature must be regarded as a range of temperature rather than a particular temperature, a point made by FRAENKEL &amp; GUNN (I940) and many other authors. It is clear from the figures (Figs 8 &amp; 9) that this range in Schistocerca extends over about Io° C, but in most experiments there was a well-defined peak which is known as the peak preferred temperature. The major difficulty arises in attempting to compare results. NIELSEN &amp; NIELSEN (I959) make the point that normal statistical methods, such as are used by HERTER (I953), are not suitable for the analysis of these results. The arithmetic mean, for instance, gives the mean distribution of the insects in the gradient and while this in itself may be useful it does not bear any constant relationship to the preference as determined by inspection. NIELSEN &amp; NIELSEN used an integrated percentage and assumed the preference to be at the 50 % level, but this again is related to general distribution and a situation could arise in which this bore no relation to the preference as indicated by a histogram. Thus for the moment it appears that inspection of the results plotted in the form of histograms is the only suitable method of determining the preference and it is clear from this that differences of one or two degrees cannot be regarded as significant. BEHAVIOUR IN THE GRADIENT As soon as the hoppers were put into the gradient they normally tended to move rapidly away from the point of entry. Apart from their position in the gradient other aspects of their behaviour were recorded and Fig. I shows the percentage frequency with which the more important of these activities were seen at different temperatures. In compiling this figure ob- servations on some extremely hungry hoppers which were active along the 286</page><page sequence="5">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA 287 whole length of the gradient have been neglected because these tended to obscure the pattern. 40 El Hopping 3 Depressed antennae 30 Abdomen raised 020, Under20-1 24-5 28-9 32 - 3 36-7 40-1 44 - 5 48- 9 52-3 56- 7 20 TMnpcI-at1rc 1e Fig. i. The temperatures at which the various aspects of behaviour were seen in the temperature gradient. Most movement in the gradient took the form of walking or running, but occasionally nymphs were seen to hop. Some hopping was seen at tempera- tures below 300 C, but the apparent sharp increase below 200 C results from the grouping of results and not from a real increase in activity at these lower temperatures. In 2I out of 23 cases in which hopping was seen at tempera- tures below 300 C the insects had moved down from a higher temperature, supporting the suggestion that a rapid fall in temperature promotes activity (CHAPMAN, I959). No hopping was seen at temperatures between 32 and 430 C except in very active hoppers which were effectively marching (ELLIS, I951). In this range the hoppers tended to become inactive and sit still for long periods; this is the preferred range of temperature. Within this range the hoppers often sat with the body close to the floor and with the antennae depressed, pointing downwards. This stance resembled the basking attitude sometimes adopted by hoppers in the field. This behaviour was most com- monly seen at 38-390 C (Fig. I), which was the peak preferred temperature.</page><page sequence="6">R. F. CHAPMAN ELLIS (I95I) noted that nymphs of Locusta adopted this attitude in her experiments at temperatures of 38-40° C. If hoppers moved up to temperatures between 42 and 45° C they generally held the body high off the ground with the legs extended, at the same time making vigorous ventilatory movements. This clearly corresponds to the 'fully stilted' position referred to by WALOFF (1963, her Fig. 9A) in adult Schistocerca in the field, and she only saw this behaviour in locusts with body temperatures over 4I° C. The hoppers in experiments often remained still in this position, but were clearly above the preferred zone and showed signs of some discomfort. Above 44° C the hoppers became very excited and hopped vigorously, making a marked, although undirected, avoidance reaction to these high temperatures. Only once was a hopper observed in a state of heat paralysis, trembling and quite unable to move; the temperature was 49° C. These temperatures agree with those given by HUSSEIN (1937) in his observations on Schistocerca nymphs. He recorded a great deal of hopping from 43 to 46° C and heat paralysis from 46 to 53° C. THE EFFECTS OF INTERNAL FACTORS ON TEMPERATURE PREFERENCE Starvat i o n. It is well known that the activity of locusts increases with starvation (ELLIS, I95I) and this would be expected to affect behaviour in the gradient. Experiments were carried out in which the insects were preconditioned at 35° C and were either starved overnight until they were tested, a period of 21-26hr starvation, or were given fresh food at the beginning of the pre- conditioning period. Following starvation there was no tendency to become inactive at high temperatures, the insects simply became trapped at the cold end of the gradient (Table I). After recent feeding activity was greatly reduced and a normal preference was apparent.

During this period there was no change in preference, well over 50% of the observations being within the range 36-4I° C at all times (Table 2).

CHAPMAN a progressive change in behaviour which is best illustrated by taking a partic- ular example. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of hoppers in the gradient at 30 min. intervals. At the end of the first half hour the hoppers were grouped within the range 33-400 C. They were extremely inactive, but slowly the group became more compact and from 1 2 to 2/5 hr from the start of the experiment the limits of distribution were never beyond 35-38o C. Then the hoppers started to get more active, presumably as they became hungry, and although in general they remained grouped the range of temperatures over which they spread increased. The spread occurred both above and below the peak preferred temperatures, but because of the sharp avoidance of high temperatures the upward spread was less marked than the downward one. This trend can also be seen, although less clearly, in the grouped results (Table 2). In the latter part of the experiments the grouping was much less than earlier on because of the activity of the hoppers. In other experiments locusts in groups were starved in dry conditions for up to 39 hr before being tested (Table 3) and the trend noticed in the TABLE 3 Distribution in the gradient of hoppers tested in groups following different periods of starvation in dry conditions Time % loss starved in Number of % of observations within temperature range hr. weight observations &lt; 22 22-25 26-29 30-33 34-37 38-41 42-45 45&lt; 0 0 400 i6 3 3 5 17 46 7 I 4 ? 97 4 3 I 7 13 43 28 0 8 9 50 8 o o 4 26 22 40 0 I5 2I 90 8 4 7 8 22 40 8 I I8 I3 90 29 7 7 7 I3 21 I7 0 39 26 46 24 7 2 15 15 I3 20 4 previous experiments was much more apparent. Up to i8 hr there was still a clear peak in the preferred zone, but because the hoppers were moving about more there were more frequent observations in the range 22-330 C than in fully fed insects. After 39 hr the preferred zone was broad and without any real peak, but it was not materially altered in position. There was clearly no downward shift since the highest number of observations was made at the upper limit of the preferred range. Following the longer periods of starvation there was an increased ten- dency for the insects to become trapped at the cold end of the gradient, but even after 39 hr this was not as marked as in isolated hoppers after 25 hr.

Water content. In practice it is impossible to separate starvation from desiccation and in view of the importance attached to water content by JAKOVLEV &amp; KRUGER (I954) some experiments were carried out with groups of insects in which an attempt was made to separate the two phenomena. In these experiments the insects were starved for different periods in a near saturated atmosphere so that they were starved without being desiccated. Some measure of the degree of desiccation was obtained by weighing the insects before and after the period of starvation. The results (Table 4) may be compared with those of the experiments in which the insects were starved for comparable periods under dry con- TABLE 4 Distribution in the gradient of hoppers tested in groups following different periods of starvation in almost saturated conditions Time % loss starved in Number of % of observations within temperature range hr. weight observations &lt;22 22-25 26-29 30-33 34-37 38-4I 42-45 45&lt; 20 I 63 I7 6 5 3 14 29 25 0 43 14 37 14 3 5 19 I9 I6 I9 5 46 9 28 7 4 I 25 25 I4 7 7 68 32 72 30 15 17 17 II 10 o o 72 17 78 21 Io 14 Io 13 22 I0 0 ditions (Table 3). After 20 hr starvation the preference was normal, com- parable with that after 8 hr under dry conditions. After 43 hr (compare 39 hr in dry) the preference was poorly defined and spread over a broad range, but was not materially altered. Following longer periods of starvation the distribution of insects in the gradient was very variable and there was never any well-defined peak. Thus after 68 hr there was no indication of preference at all, but after 72 hr, with a rather smaller loss in weight, there was a slight peak at 38-4I° C. After 46 hr, although the loss in weight was slight, the peak distribution was in the range 30-37° C, rather lower than normal. Comparison of Tables 3 and 4 suggests that these changes in activity and distribution were rather more closely connected with the period of starvation 29I</page><page sequence="10">R. F. CHAPMAN than with the percentage loss in weight. For instance, the distribution after 39 and 43 hr starvation was similar although the loss in weight was 26% and I4% respectively. To test this more objectively mean values of the distribution of insects above 25° C have been calculated. These do not bear any consistent relationship to the preferred temperature peak, but are the only objective measure readily obtainable from these data. The correlations of these means with the period of starvation and the percentage loss in weight were both significant (starvation: r = -0.8, t = 4.3, o.ooI &gt; p; weight loss r = -0.7, t = 3.3, o.oI &gt; p &gt; o.ooI.) so that from these data it is impossible to differentiate between the two phenomena, which in any case are themselves closely linked.

These changes in distribution seemed to be related to changes in the activity of the hoppers and a measure of this activity has been obtained by calculating a coefficient of change of position of insects in the range 35-44° C. This was calculated by summing the displacements into and out from this zone between successive observations and then taking a mean. Activity increased with starvation up to about 20 hr and then began to decline slowly. After 40 hr starvation activity declined much more rapidly (Fig. 3). As a result of the initial increase in activity the groups which were 292</page><page sequence="11">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA normally formed at the peak preferred temperature were much less stable, continually breaking up and reforming. This resulted in a tendency to mill round the peak temperature so that it became less well-defined and the area occupied by the hoppers was extended, both upwards and downwards, so as to give a fairly uniform coverage of the preferred range from 30 to 45° C. However, because of the tendency to avoid the higher temperatures the extension tended to be greater on the lower side. This continued up to about 40 hr starvation, but further starvation caused a considerable reduction in activity which sometimes fell below the original level in well fed insects. At this stage there was little tendency to become active at lower temperatures so that there was a fairly even distribution along the length of the gradient. Insects at this stage were sometimes trapped at the cold end of the gradient or, if they came into the preferred zone at all, they became quiescent giving a poorly defined peak of preference. A point of difference between insects tested singly and in groups is that the former tended to get trapped at the cold end of the gradient after only some 20 hr starvation. In groups trapping at low temperatures was much less marked even after 40 hr starvation. JAKOVLEV &amp; KRUGER (I954) obtained essentially similar results with European grasshoppers although in their experiments the effects of starvation became apparent much more quickly, within the course of a 5 hr experiment. In all cases their results show a tendency for the preferred range to become less well-defined as the experiment proceeded and in some cases there was a tendency for the insects to become trapped at the cold end, although they interpreted this as a change in preference. In Chorthippus parallelus and C. dorsatus they obtained an apparent progressive lowering of the preference as time progressed, but this was not consistent. In C. parallelus, for instance, in which the change was most marked, a modal value after 5 hr is only I° C lower than that after 2 hr although most insects were at lower temperatures after the longer period. It is suggested that this reflects an increase in the activity of the insects similar to that observed in Schistocerca and that there was no real change in preference. I n s t a r. Nymphs from three egg pods which hatched at the same time were reared in a crowd at 30° C and each day throughout hopper life a sample of Io was removed and tested in a group in the temperature gradient. The overall results (Fig. 4) suggest a slight increase in the peak preferred temperature from 34-35° C in the first instar to 40-4I° C in the fourth and fifth instars. On the other hand, the variability of the peak preference from day to day 293</page><page sequence="12">294 R. F. CHAPMAN was considerable (Fig. 5) and from the third to fifth instars there is no suggestion of a real change. BODENHEIMER (I929) found an increase in preference with each instar of Schistocerca and VOLKONSKY (I939) confirmed his results. The increase which he obtained was rather more marked than in the present experiments with peak preferences (from BODENHEIMER'S table i6) ranging from 27-28' C in the first instar to 37-38o C in the fifth instar. The variation which BODENHEIMER obtained in old and young adults VOLKONSKY (1939) attributes to a change in behaviour, not a change in preference. 30 20 . 1 st Instar 10 40. 30. 2 nd Instar 20 10L- 10 30- 20 * 3 rd Instar 10 30 20 4rth I nstsar 10 GO .I 20- 5th Instar 10 Under 22-3 26-7 30-1 34-5 38-9 42-3 46-7 20 Trmperature OC Fig. 4.

CHAPMAN (1953) obtained the same preference (3-35° C) for first, second and fifth instar Locusta preconditioned at 20° C. After preconditioning at 30° C third, fourth and fifth instar hoppers all had preferences of 35-40° C so that if there were any differences between instars they were slight.

The later instars inevitably occupied a wider range than the earlier ones since, because of their larger size, 10 hop- pers could not pack into so small an area. It is also worth noting that the figure for second instar hoppers is unusually low. For the whole series of experiments on second instar nymphs a modal value of 40-4I° C with a range of 34-45° C was indicated (Figs 8 &amp; 9). This may suggest that the increase in preferred temperature in successive instars was more apparent than real. Such a difference could result from differences in the mobility of the dif- ferent instars, the slower moving first instar nymphs responding as they 295</page><page sequence="14">R. F. CHAPMAN moved into the lower end of the preferred range whereas the older nymphs were carried through this zone before they responded. In addition there was a slight vertical air temperature gradient above the floor at the hot end of the gradient. At 40° C the temperature 5 mm above the floor was rarely as much as I° C lower than the floor temperature, but with increasing height the difference was almost certainly greater than this. If, as is suggested, insects in the temperature gradient respond to the sum of stimulation from all parts of the body it follows that differently sized insects at the same point in the gradient will be stimulated by different sets of conditions. For first instar nymphs standing only about 3 mm off the floor the temperature at 5 mm may be a little low compared to the general temperature to which the insect is responding. For second and third instar nymphs 5 mm is at about head height and so may give a fair measure of the temperature to which the insect is responding. On the other hand fourth and fifth instar nymphs stand much higher than 5 mm and although they will perceive the temperatures at the lower levels they will also perceive the rather lower ones nearer the roof of the gradient. Thus the temperature at 5 mm may be rather higher than the overall temperature to which these insects are responding. If this is true the preference of first instar nymphs would be slightly higher than that indicated by the experiments while that for fourth and fifth instars would be lower, so tending to cancel out the differences. This explanation would also account for the bigger differences which BODEN- HEIMER (I929) found, since the difference between air and floor tempera- tures in his apparatus was certainly greater than in the apparatus used in these experiments. The accumulated evidence shows that, if there is any change in preference at all, the change is a small one without any marked alteration in the overall range. But for the results of VOLKONSKY (I939), which are based on body temperatures, one could conclude that there was no change at all in the preferred temperatures of successive instars. Age within an instar. The experiments on age involved repeated testing throughout each instar and so gave some information about possible changes of preference within an instar. There was no consistent picture (Fig. 5), but there was a sug- gestion that peak preferences were lower towards the end of an instar. VOLKONSKY (I939) found the preference of fifth instar nymphs of Locusta and Schistocerca to be lower towards the end of the instar. If this reduction is real it was not closely related to moulting since it occurred as much as two days before an insect moulted. BODENHEIMER 296</page><page sequence="15">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA 297 (1929) found the preference of newly hatched Schistocerca nymphs to be 20 C higher than in older first instar nymphs, but this was not observed in the present experiments or the previous ones on L ocusta (CHAPMAN, 1953). Immediately before a moult there was a change in the behaviour of the nymphs in the gradient. They became active moving up and down the gradient trying to climb on the roof and often they became trapped at the cold end. The temperatures at which moulting was observed in the gradient are given in Table 5.

The absence of any records in the range 35-440 C is not surprising since this was the region occupied by other locusts which were not moulting, but were exhibiting a normal temperature preference. Locusts about to moult avoided the immediate neigh- bourhood of other locusts as far as possible. After moulting locusts sometimes remained quiescent for a time, but usually moved about and often came into the preferred zone where they became quiescent. From the data from the few insects which moulted in the course of experiments there was no evidence of the preferred temperature being any different in the first 5 hr of an instar from any other time (Table 6).

The lower levels of activity after being at lower temperatures were probably due to a combination of factors: the food in the tubes remained fresher and more edible for longer periods at the lower saturation deficits; the rate at which food was digested and passed through the gut was lower (CHAPMAN, 1957) SO that they became hungry less quickly; the insects took some time to warm up after they were put into the gradient. Comparable experiments using groups of hoppers preconditioned at 30° C showed a peak preference of 38-41° C (see Table 3) so that grouping does not obviously modify the results, except to make the preference better defined. When the locusts were preconditioned at 45° C the peak distribution was below 22° C (Table 7) because the insects tended to become trapped at the cold end of the gradient. Apart from this slightly more time was spent in the range 34-37° C. These insects were extremely active, remaining still for only IO min. out of every 30 compared with 20 min. after preconditioning at 25° C (Table 7). This probably resulted from much more rapid drying of the food (saturation deficit 54mm) so that the hoppers were extremely hungry. Their behaviour in the gradient suggested that they were continually searching for food and only when activity was strongly depressed by low temperatures did they remain still. In subsequent experiments insects preconditioned at 45° C were given fresh food at the start of the preconditioning period. In this case a well- defined preference was obtained, but the peak preference was lower than normal. This reflects the very low level of activity of these insects with a tendency to sit still as soon as they came within the preferred range. It was 298</page><page sequence="17">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA not a real difference in preference as was shown by other experiments in which the locusts were put into the gradient at about 430 C instead of 30° C. In these experiments the range of inactivity of insects preconditioned at I5, 35 or 45° C was displaced upwards as compared with insects similarly preconditioned, but put into the gradient at 300 C (Table 8).

It is clear from this that the point of entry into the gradient can affect the subsequent distribution of insects and must be taken into account in interpreting the results. The distribution of insects in the gradient varied slightly with the time that they were in it even in the individual experiments lasting only 30 min.

F. CHAPMAN second 5 min. (Table 9). After preconditioning at I5° C, however, they were very inactive for the first few minutes and as a result there was a peak in their distribution in the range 26-29° C where they were dropped in. Then as they warmed up they became more active and moved about until they came into the preferred zone so that by the second 15 min. of the experiment they were showing a well-defined preference. After preconditioning at 25 or 35° C preferences were the same throughout the experiment, but in the second 15 min. rather more time was spent in the higher parts of the range. This change resulted from the manner in which the experiments were carried out and is not regarded as a change in preference. The insects were put into the gradient just below 30° C. From here they moved about until they came into the preferred zone and then they became quiescent. Since they inevitably came into this zone from lower temperatures they tended to sit rather low down in the preferred range. Later they tended to creep along in the direction in which they were facing so that they gradually moved to higher temperatures. If the insects were put into the gradient at the hot end they became quiescent towards the upper part of the preferred range (Table 8) and in 7 out of Io experiments after preconditioning at 35° C the locusts had moved to slightly lower temperatures in the second half of the experiment. These changes suggest that the preferred range of temper- atures is wide (from about 30 to 45° C), but with a peak of preference at or just below 40° C. Insects tend to become quiescent anywhere within the range, but are most quiescent at the peak temperatures so that there is a tendency to move slowly into this more limited range from within the broader one. After preconditioning at 45° C the distribution was similar in both halves of the experiment with a peak in the range 30-33° C.

In these experiments the preconditioning period varied from 3 to Iohr, but, except at 45° C, the different times did not affect the subsequent pref- erence (Table Io). After preconditioning at 45° C for periods of less than 5 hr the distribution of insects in the gradient was normal with most time being spent in the range 34-4I° C. Periods of more than 5 hr at this temper- ature greatly reduced the activity of the insects so that they tended to sit still as soon as they came into the preferred range. Since insects with the shorter preconditioning periods had fresher food than those preconditioned for more than 5 hr this result indicates that the low level of activity of the latter did not result from recent feeding, but was related to the high temper- atures to which they had been subjected. Longer periods of preconditioning at high temperatures were tested by rearing nymphs at 42° C from the time of hatching until they were tested in the second instar. As a result of this treatment they were pale in colour and very inactive, spending nearly twice as much time sitting still in the gradient as hoppers reared at 30° C and preconditioned for short periods at 35° C (Table 11). Because of their low level of activity they tended to become stationary as soon as they moved into the preferred temperature range, but a few put into the gradient at 43° C showed that there was no real change in preference (Table II).

The preconditioning temperature used in the earlier ex- periments was 20° C and this might be expected to reduce activity in the same way, although to a lesser extent, as the experiments described here with a preconditioning temperature of I5° C. This might result in a tendency 30I</page><page sequence="20">R. F. CHAPMAN for the insects to sit in the lower part of the preferred range and so to lower the peak preference. The completely normal distribution of the results (see CHAPMAN, I955, Fig. 3) suggests that this was not a real change in pref- erence. Typically there is a sharp fall off in the distribution above the peak temperature because of the avoidance of higher temperatures (see distri- bution after preconditioning at 30° C in CHAPMAN, I955), but this is not true of the 20° C distribution. Clearly there was no avoidance of temperatures immediately above the peak in this case which suggests that if the hoppers had come into the higher range they would have stayed there. The experi- mental method was such that the majority of hoppers came into the pre- ferred range from below so that the peak distribution was lower than normal. It does not necessarily follow from this that phenomena other than pre- ferred temperature are uninfluenced by the preconditioning temperature. Field work strongly suggests that levels and perhaps ranges of activity are influenced in this way. Humi d it y. A series of experiments was carried out in which hoppers were precon- ditioned at 35° C, but at different saturation deficits.

In all cases the preference was much the same, falling within the range 34-4I° C, but at high saturation deficit (30-40mm Hg) the preference was slightly lower after a longer period of preconditioning and so after a longer period of desiccation. The difference was not marked, but it occurred consistently in three separate series of experiments and the trend is also apparent if the peak preferences of individual hoppers are plotted against time (Fig. 6).

A similar result was obtained when insects were preconditioned at a high saturation deficit without any food if they were simply dropped into the gradient and then left alone. If, however, they were immediately 'chased' up the gradient to about 40° C, so that this was their effective starting point, there was no drop in preference after longer periods of preconditioning (Fig. 7). This again suggests that there was no real change in preference in these experiments, but that the insects became quiescent as soon as they moved into the preferred range, which they normally did from the lower end so that their apparent preference was lower. 45.

In the temperature gradient this would imply sitting at a lower temperature and a suggestion of this was obtained. On the other hand in these experiments the dew point was only 6° C so that at 30° C and above the relative humidity was well below 30% and an alteration in the peak preference by I or 2° C would not materially affect the humidity. It is clear that in these experiments the humidity during the preconditioning period cannot have affected the results. ~~~~~~~~~~42 ^ ~~~~~X Nodisturbance X 0 0 Startat 40 C 40' X 0 0 X 0 0 .u 38 O O y 38- 0 0 34- 0 X 32' 30 . . . 3 7 9 Time starved at high saturation deficit (Hours) Fig. 7.

HERTER (1953) quotes several examples in which a particular species from a wet habitat had a slightly lower temperature preference than members of the same species from a dry habitat. Unfortunately he gives only mean values, which may bear little relation to the preferences, but in any case the differences which he quotes never exceeded 3° C and were generally less. In addition he cites several instances in which the preferences of insects from two such localities were similar and since he used such small numbers it cannot justifiably be concluded that there was any difference between the insects from the two habitats. 304</page><page sequence="23">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA THE TEMPERATURE PREFERENCE From all these experiments it appears that the peak of temperature pref- erence is not affected by preconditioning, except for extremes of temper- ature and possibly high saturation deficit. Therefore, in order to obtain a reliable picture of temperature preference in isolated second instar nymphs of Schistocerca all the data derived from nymphs preconditioned at 35° C, except for those at high saturation deficits, have been pooled (Fig. 8).

The amount of time spent stationary at different temperatures by all the hoppers preconditioned at 35° C. indicates a preferred range extending from 34 to 45° C with a peak at 40-4I° C. There was a sharp avoidance of high temperatures so that the fall off above 41° C is sharp compared with the rise from 34 to 40° C. Above 45° C the insects were only rarely inactive and from 20-33° C they were normally active. Below 20° C activity was reduced by the low temper- atures as HUSSEIN (I937) also found. An alternative method of using the data is to determine the temperature at which each hopper sat still for most time and then to plot the frequency of these individual preferences. Treated in this way the result is similar (Fig. 9); the preferred range extends from 34 to 45° C with a peak at 40-4I° C. The sharp fall off above 4I° C is even more marked than in Fig. 8. In the group experiments the range extended from 32-36 to 43° C with a peak at 38-39° C. 305</page><page sequence="24">306 R. F.

The preference was the same with a peak at 38-4I° C (Table 13), although under these conditions the preference was slightly less well-defined than usual (cf. Table 13, line 3 with table 5, line I). This apparently resulted from a high degree of activity and Aziz (I957) recorded the highest levels of activity at very high humi- dities. JAKOVLEV &amp; KRUGER (1954) also found the preferred zone to be less well-defined in insects tested in a saturated gradient and with Oedipoda caerulescens and Mecostethus grossus, but not with other species, they ob- tained a slight (2° C) lowering of the peak preferred temperature. In the case of Mecostethus at least the normal form of the distribution curve in the saturated gradient (JAKOVLEV &amp; KROGER, 1954, Fig. I) indicates that there was no sharp avoidance of the higher temperatures. This suggests that there was no real reduction in temperature preference, but because of their higher level of activity the insects tended to spend more time in the lower parts of the range as they do when they start to become active after a short period of starvation. JAKOVLEV &amp; KRUtGER (1954) consider that a true preference is only obtained in saturated air since otherwise there is an interaction between temperature and humidity because of the water lost by the insect in trans- piration. In dry air the insects alter their position so as to regulate the water loss. GUNN (I934) has shown that this does occur in Blatta, although only in desiccated animals, and HERTER (1953) also agrees that there is an interaction. Since Aziz (I957) has shown that Schistocerca nymphs have distinct zones of minimum activity with respect to humidity one would expect the response of the insects in the gradient to result from an interaction between humidity and temperature. On the other hand small differences in temper- ature will make very little difference to humidity or to water loss through transpiration. Water loss through the cuticle will only alter markedly with a small change in temperature around the critical temperature at which the wax in the cuticle becomes disorientated and this is above the preferred temperature (BEAMENT, I959). MILLER (I960) apparently found no in- crease in ventilation rates with temperature up to 30° C and marked venti- latory movements were only seen in the gradient when the insects were above the preferred temperature and were stilting. In view of this and the similarity of the preference in saturated and dry conditions it must be concluded that in these experiments the responses of the locusts were very little altered by the humidity in the gradient or by differences in their rate of water loss. 3o7</page><page sequence="26">R. F. CHAPMAN MECHANISM OF TEMPERATURE PREFERENCE Temperature may act on the insect in one of two ways; either by peri- pheral sense organs in the same way as other extrinsic phenomena or directly on the nervous system as a result of changes in the body temperature. Very little is known of temperature receptors in Orthoptera. GEIST (1928) believed the general body surface to be sensitive, the most sensitive parts being the proximal half of the antennae and the tarsi of the fore and hind legs. IBRAHIM (I959) found that after amputation of the antennae and the maxillary and labial palps grasshoppers still responded to temperature, although more slowly than before, suggesting that these organs did play some part in temperature reception. KERKUT &amp; TAYLOR (I957) working on Periplaneta have recorded changes in the output of the tarsal nerve fol- lowing changes in the temperature of the tarsus. They suggest the presence of a receptor towards the tip of the tarsus, but did not locate any structure. In addition, KERKUT &amp; TAYLOR (1958) showed that the output of an isolated ganglion from the central nervous system varied with temperature. There was a decrease in output at temperatures corresponding with the preferred temperature and an increase above and below this level. If this is also true in grasshoppers it follows that the body temperature must have some effect on the output of the central nervous system although this may be modulated by the sensory input. It seems likely that sensory input does play some part because it is known that changes in body temperature lag behind changes in air temperature (CLARKE, 1960) whereas the response to the preferred temperature in the temperature gradient was rapid. Several experiments were carried out in which the antennae or tarsi or both were amputated and the insects tested after a day in which to recover. A few fifth instar nymphs were also tested after removal of the tarsi, but in all these cases the peak preference was 38-4I° C (Table I4). The insects TABLE 14 Distribution in the gradient of hoppers tested in groups following amputation of antennae, tarsi or both Number of % of observations within temperature range Condition observations &lt;22 22-25 26-29 30-33 34-37 38-4I 42-45 45&lt; Second instar hoppers No antennae 80 I9 14 9 7 21 24 19 o No tarsi 58 i6 3 2 3 i6 39 21 o No antennae or tarsi 94 32 3 4 5 9 31 13 3 Fifth instar hoppers No tarsi 85 41 I i 5 i8 I8 5 o 308</page><page sequence="27">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA 309 were sluggish so that a rather high percentage became trapped below 220 C, and this possibly suggests that receptors are present on these organs, but it is clear that if there are thermal receptors on the antennae or tarsi they are not of overriding importance in temperature preference. Finally an attempt was made to determine whether the insects responded to the air temperature or the floor temperature in these experiments, since 30 Distribution with air and 20 floor temperatures equal 10 0 . 20 Distribution relative to air rtemperaturc with floor temperature greater than air temper-ature 10ai meere 20 Tuprratt Distribution rclativ n to eoor n temperature wereeq ntempedaturc with floor tensperaturc gr ister than 10t- e ir temperature 20I t Temperature OC f 4 Fig. io. The distribution of hoppers in groups in tresl t o he n f loor and air temperatures were equal and when the floor temperature was higher than the air temperature. In the latter instance the distribution is plotted separately against floor temperature and air temperature. it was believed that this might throw some light on the receptors involved. In this experiment the double plate glass roofing of the trough was replaced by a domed strip of perf orated zinc. As a result of this the air 5 mm above the floor at the hot end of the gradient was more than 5' C cooler than the floor at the same point. There was some variation in this temperature, but it was not great. Insects were put into the gradient and tested in the usual way, but their distribution was plotted against both air and floor tempera- tures (Fig. io). There was a very good correspondance between the distri- bution relative to air temperature and the distribution in experiments with</page><page sequence="28">3IO R. F. CHAPMAN air and floor temperature the same. The distribution relative to floor tem- perature on the other hand was quite different and suggested that the insects would remain at much higher temperature than those normally observed. This is taken to indicate that air temperature is much more important than floor temperature in the determination of temperature preference. It appears that there must be thermal receptors widely distributed over the body as GEIST (1928) suggested and these are of primary importance in temperature pref- erence. Subsequently, when body temperatures equilibrate with air tempera- tures, the direct effect of body temperature on the nervous system may also become important. DISCUSSION These experiments on Schistocerca nymphs show that the preferred range of temperature is wide, from about 34 to 450 C, but with a peak usually between 38 and 41 C. The data obtained suggest that temperature preference is constant irrespective of the treatment before and during the experiments, although there is possibly a slight change in the course of an instar. The overall activity of the insect may be modified by preconditioning and this may result in its sitting low down in the preferred range, but this arises from the experimental method and is not a change of preference. In some cases, as with starvation, the preference may be eliminated. HERTER (1953) also considered the preference to be constant within a species, adults of Tetrix spp. having similar preferences in spring and autumn. On the other hand he did claim to have obtained differences in the preferences of Chorthippus spp. from different localities and supposed that the preference might be fixed by the conditions of the environment at some sensitive stage in the course of development. The differences were very small, only about I0 C between arithmetic means, and cannot be regarded as significant. BODENHEIMER (I929) found differences between young and old adult Schistocerca and attributed their differences to differing physiology, but subsequently VOLKONSKY (I939) showed that the apparent low preference obtained by BODENHEIMER in old adults resulted from their different be- haviour. At this time the drive inducing searching for a mate or suitable oviposition site was stronger than the normal temperature response so that no preference was obtained. This is comparable with the lack of preference observed in insects immediately before they moulted. Thus it appears that within a species the preferred temperature range is virtually constant. The small amount of variation which occurs within an instar does not affect the range. Examination of the literature further sug-</page><page sequence="29">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA gests that within the Acridoidea the majority of species have the same or very similar preferences. PARKER (1924) found the preference of Camnula pelltcida from North America to be 37-380 C. BODENHEIMER (I935) obtained data on temperature preference of 20 species of grasshoppers from Palestine. The mean figures for their distribution all fell between 32 and 370 C and BODENHEIMER considered that there was no difference between them irrespective of their ecological or seasonal distribution. Because of the sharp avoidance of high temperatures the distribution curve of grasshoppers in a temperature gradient is almost invariably skewed with a long tail towards the cold end. As a result the arithmetic mean will generally be lower than the mode, which I regard as the peak preferred temperature. This suggests that the peak preferred temperatures of the grasshoppers which BODEN- HEIMER tested were higher than the mean temperatures which he gives, thus bringing them even more into line with the present data on Schistocerca. This can be confirmed in the case of Acrotylus insubricus. BODENHEIMER figures his results for this species (his fig. 6b) and this shows a distinct mode at 39° C. The mean value given in his table 7 is 37° C. In the field BODENHEIMER found that the grasshoppers tended to group in the sun when their body temperatures were 36-4I° C. RUBTZOV (1935) carried out temperature preference experiments on various Siberian grasshoppers, using mainly second and third instar nymphs. He did not obtain any well-defined preferences, but it is possible that this resulted from the inactivity of the insects. In experiments using second instar nymphs of African grasshoppers CHAPMAN (in prep.) also sometimes found no clear preference, or could produce a false peak in distribution by the experimental method. This resulted from the extreme inactivity of the insects which sometimes remained stationary throughout the 5 hr of the experiment. If they were activated, as by starvation, a normal preference was obtained. RUBTZOV concluded that temperature preference was greatly modified by other factors. He thought the preference was probably at 22-26° C, since this was the zone of maximum activity, but this surely suggests that the preferred zone, which is a zone of inactivity, was at a higher temperature than this. He observed grouping at the cold end below 18° C, which suggests that the lower limit for activity was little, if any different from that in tropical grasshoppers. KROGERUS (I937), working on Chorthippus brunneus and Mecostethus grossus in Finland, obtained preferred temperature ranges of 24-32 and I4-I8° C respectively. The results are based on the distribution of the insects after 5 hr in the gradient and in the case of Mecostethus it is clear that the insects had moved down to the cold end and become trapped there, probably 3II</page><page sequence="30">R. F. CHAPMAN as a result of starvation, in exactly the same way as was found by JAKOVLEV &amp; KRTUGER (I954). It is clear from their Fig. 4 for Chorthippus dorsatus and C. parallelus that if the distribution at the end of 5 hr had been con- sidered in isolation the preference for both species might be taken to be below 20° C whereas earlier in the experiment a normal preference between 35 and 40° C was obtained. It is impossible to assess the significance of the results obtained by KROGERUS with C. brunneus, but they seem of doubtful value. The experiments of VOLKONSKY (I939) are not quite comparable with all the others dicussed because he measured the body temperatures at which various stages turned from a perpendicular to a parallel orientation to a source of heat. It is probable that this temperature corresponds to the peak preferred temperature. It ranged from 34-42° C in Schistocerca, Locusta and Anacridium melanorhodon, increasing with the stage of development. The preferences of solitary locusts were about 2° C lower than those of gregarious insects, but fell within the same range. HERTER (I94I, 1943, I953) has determined the preferred temperatures of 21 species of European grasshoppers from Germany. He claims to have obtained differences in the preferences of grasshoppers from different habitats, but even taking the extreme values from his hot, dry Steppe and the cool, wet grassland there is only a difference of about 4° C in his mean values. If there is any real difference it is not very marked and since he used such small numbers of insects it is impossible to assess the validity of the differences which he obtained. All the values obtained by HERTER fall within the range 40-460 C., but as previously stated these are arithmetic means and their relationship to the mode cannot be determined. In the species which HERTER figures however (HERTER, I953, figs. 37, 42 and 43) the means and modes do not differ by more than I° C and, in the absence of any alternative, the mean values must be accepted as the peak preferred temperatures. This suggests that the preferred temperatures of the insects he tested were higher than those tested by other authors, but it is probable that this difference can be accounted for in the methods used by HERTER. In his apparatus (figured in HERTER, I953, fig. 23) he measured the temperature of the floor of the gradient rather than the air above the floor and because of the design of his apparatus it is likely that there were marked vertical gradients in the air temperature. It has been shown that air temperature is more important to the insect than floor temperature in the preference reaction and that when the air tempera- ture is less than the floor temperature, as it would be in HERTER'S apparatus, an abnormally high preference is obtained if distribution is plotted against 312</page><page sequence="31">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA floor temperature. Secondly, in at least some of the experiments HERTER only measured the temperature at one point at either end of the gradient and the temperature at intermediate points was calculated by interpolating in a straight line between the two extremes. It is most unlikely that the increase in temperature along the gradient was linear and from this, together with the measurement of floor rather than air temperatures, it probably follows that the figures which HERTER gives are high by several degrees. It is con- cluded that HERTER'S results are largely in agreement with those obtained by other authors. CHAPMAN (I953) found a preference of 35-40° C for all the later instars of Locusta and recently (in prep.) has obtained similar figures for several species of African and European grasshoppers and the South American Schistocerca paranensis. JAKOVLEV &amp; KRUGER (1954) also obtained peak preferences within this range for all the European grasshoppers they studied. The range for the smaller species was wider than for the larger ones, but this could well be a function of activity. In some experiments on African grasshoppers, in which small, second instar nymphs were used, the preferred zones were poorly defined because the insects were extremely inactive and moved very little throughout the experiment (CHAPMAN, in prep.) and the relative mobility of small insects is less than that of big ones. Finally, there is the work of IBRAHIM (I959) who determined the pre- ferences of Aiolopus thalassinus and Sphingonotus carinatus in Egypt using an alternative chamber in which the two sides of the apparatus were at dif- ferent temperatures. He found a preferred range of 37-42° C for Aiolopus and 42-48° C for Sphingonotus. This last appears to be the only instance so far found amongst the grasshoppers of a species having a preferred range completely outside the range 35-40° C. It is significant that S. carinatus is a desert living species found in extremely hot and arid habitats. From this survey it is concluded that the preferred temperature range is virtually the same in all the Acridoidea so far examined with the single exception of S. carinatus. Thus, it seems clear that temperature preference cannot be an important factor in determining the distribution of grasshoppers as UVAROV (1931) suggested, although it may be for other insects. JAKOVLEV &amp; KRTUGER (1954) believed that the high and constant temperature prefer- ence of the European grasshoppers indicated the importance of considering microclimate rather than macroclimate in discussing distribution and essen- tially similar points are made by BODENHEIMER (1935) and RICHARDS &amp; WALOFF (I954). HERTER (I953) concluded that the preferred temperature range of grass- hoppers was towards the upper end of the range in which they were active 313</page><page sequence="32">R. F. CHAPMAN and that it coincided with the optimal range of temperature. HAMILTON (I936, I950) working on the optimal conditions for development of various species of locusts concluded that there was no one temperature which could be regarded as optimal for all the stages of life. He makes the point (I950) that quantitative activities, such as the number of egg pods per female, have lower optima than speed activities like the rate of nymphal development. Of these two aspects the latter seems to be more closely related to basic metabolism. In this category are the rate of nymphal development, the rate of sexual maturation and the period of incubation of the eggs. The optima for these phenomena are high in all cases and although there is some varia- tion between species the figures generally fall within a comparable range. For Schistocerca the optima are 380 C, 37° C and 37° C respectively; for Locusta 420 C, 39° C and 43° C (HAMILTON, I950); and for Nomadacris 380 C, 380 C and 32-380 C (HAMILTON, I936). Other factors are less directly related to basic metabolism or involve a balance between it and some other phenomenon. Thus the number of eggs produced per female involves a balance between the utilisation of food for basic metabolism and for yolk production. If basic metabolism is too high little food will be available for yolk production so that fewer eggs are pro- duced. Consequently the optimum temperature for egg production is lower; most egg pods are produced by both Schistocerca and Locusta at 34° C while maximum numbers of eggs per pod are obtained at still lower temperatures. Similarly it seems reasonable to suppose that adult life will be prolonged if metabolism is slowed down although MAYNARD SMITH (1963) has recently questioned this 'rate of living' theory. On the other hand temperature must be sufficiently high for the insects to feed and assimilate their food and correlated with this HAMILTON (I950) found the optimal temperatures for adult life to be between 24 and 27° C for both locust species. Thus the optimal temperatures for the phenomena more directly related to basic metabolism generally fall between 37 and 43° C. Bearing in mind the obvious experimental differences, these values correspond well with the preferred temperature range of the grasshoppers. It is suggested that temperature preference is a behavioural mechanism tending to keep the insect within a range of temperature which is optimal for most basic metabolic processes. HUSSEIN's (I937) results are at variance with this suggestion. He used an apparatus in which the temperature at any one time was uniform, but which was varied throughout the course of the ex- periment. He did not obtain any reduction in activity corresponding to tem- perature preference, and the preferred range as indicated by the present experiments corresponds with his stage of "nervousness" which he con- 3I4</page><page sequence="33">BEHAVIOUR OF SCHISTOCERCA GREGARIA sidered outside the normal range for activity. The main difference between the two sets of experiments is that in the temperature gradient there is a spatial or, as KENNEDY (I939) said, a very rapid variation in temperature as opposed to a purely temporal and much slower change and it may be this which is important in eliciting the temperature preference response. SUMMARY Observations were made on the behaviour of second instar nymphs of Schistocerca gregaria in a temperature gradient. Hopping was seen at low and high temperatures, but not within the range 32-43° C. At higher temperatures active ventilatory movements and marked avoidance reactions were observed. The preferred temperature range in which the hoppers became quiescent was about 34-45° C with a peak at 40-4I° C. Following prolonged starvation the response dis- appeared. It was impossible to separate starvation from desiccation with certainty, but the former seemed to be more important with respect to its effects on temperature preference. There was an apparent increase in preference in later instar nymphs, but this may not have been a real change and did not materially affect the range. The same is true of a possible slight fall in the peak preference in the latter part of each instar. Preference did not vary following preconditioning at different temperatures and humidities, but the peak preference was affected by the activity of the nymphs and their point of entry into the gradient. It is suggested that the reaction results from a reduced output from the central nervous system in the preferred temperature range. This arises as a result of the direct effect of temperature on the nervous system modulated by the sensory input from widely distributed peripheral thermal receptors. Experiments showed that the antennae and tarsi were not particularly important as sites for thermal receptors and the overall response was to air temperature rather than surface temperature. The preferred range of temperature is wide, but constant and it also appears to be much the same, with a peak at about 40° C, in all but one of the grasshoppers so far studied. It is suggested that temperature preference is a behavioural mechanism tending to keep the insect within a range of temperatures which is optimal for most basic metabolic processes.

Sie sprangen in tief en und hohen Temperaturen, aber nicht zwischen 32 bis 430 C. Bei h6heren Tempe- raturen machten sie starke Ventilationsbewegungen und zeigten ausgepragte Vermeide- reaktionen. Die Vorzugstemperatur, bei der das Hiipfen aufh6rte, reichte von 34 bis 45 mit dem Gipfel bei 40 bis 41 C. Nach lIngerem Hungern ging diese Reaktion verloren. Die Wirkungen von Hunger und Austrocknung sicher zu unterscheiden war nicht m6glich, aber der Hunger schien die Temperaturbevorzugung starker zu beeinflussen. Bei Nym- phen spaterer Stadien war die Bevorzugung offensichtlich starker, aber das diirfte kein wirklicher Unterschied sein und die Vorzugsgrenzen nicht wesentlich verschieben. Das- selbe gilt fuir einen anscheinend leichten Abfall der Spitzenbevorzugung kurz vor jeder Hautung. Die Bevorzugung blieb unverandert durch vorhergegangene Haltung der Tiere in verschiedenen Temperaturen und Feuchtigkeiten, doch hing die Spitzenbevor- zugung ab von der Aktivitait der Nymphen und der Temperatur, die am Eintrittspunkt in die Orgel herrschte. Als Deutung wird vorgeschlagen, dass die Reaktion auf verringerter Erregung des Zentralnervensystems in der Vorzugstemperatur beruht; und dafiir verantwortlich ist wiederum die unmittelbare Wirkung der Temperatur auf das Nervensystem, der durch die Sinneserregung der weit uiber die ganze Korperoberflache verteilten Thermorecep- toren moduliert wird. Ausschaltversuchen zufolge scheinen die Antennen und Tarsen auch Warmesinnesorgane zu tragen; insgesamt schienen die Tiere eher auf die Luft- als auf die Oberflachentemperatur zu reagieren. Der bevorzugte Temperaturbereich ist breit, aber konstant und scheint bei allen bisher untersuchten Arten gleicherweise seinen Gipfel bei 400 C zu haben; nur eine wich ab. Die Temperaturbevorzugung diirfte ein Verhaltensmechanismus sein, der das Tier inner- halb der fur die wichtigsten Stoffwechselvorgange giinstigsten Temperaturgrenzen halt.</page></plain_text>
