<plain_text><page sequence="1">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN: CHAPTER 16 OF THE THEOLOGICO-POUTICAL TREATISE STEVEN B. SMITH xVmong students of spinoza it is generally acknowledged that chap ter 16 represents a new beginning in the Theologico-Political Treatise. There is, however, considerably less agreement as to what this new beginning signifies. For some it marks a radical new teaching about the state of nature and natural law, while for others it is regarded as derivative of the more fundamental and pathbreaking work initiated by Hobbes.1 Less often, though, is chapter 16 regarded as the birth place of modern democratic theory. Yet a century before Rousseau, Spinoza embraced democracy as the form of government most consis tent with the natural law and in agreement with human liberty.2 Correspondence to: Department of Political Science, P.O.

Leo Strauss goes to the opposite extreme suggesting that "Spinoza's political theory, and in particular his theory of natural right ... is toto coelo different from the theory of Hobbes, with whom his name is often coupled"; Leo Strauss, Spinoza's Critique of Religion, trans. E. M. Sinclair (New York: Schocken, 1965) 229. Noel Malcolm tries to split the difference between Hobbes and Spinoza, suggesting that Spinoza arrived at a "liberal, pluralistic theory of the state" out of Hobbes' "reductive style of power analysis," while at the same time maintaining that Spinoza's metaphysics was "radically differ ent" from Hobbes' as was his theory of reason and human liberty; Noel Malcolm "Hobbes and Spinoza," in The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 1450-1700, ed.

Copyright ? 1994 by the Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">360 STEVEN B. SMITH There are several reasons that have contributed to the neglect of the Treatise as a classic of modern democratic theory. In the first place, Spinoza's political theory is buried three quarters of the way through the Treatise and comes to light only after the reader has slogged through a long and painstaking discussion of biblical philology and criticism. Second, Spinoza's defense of democracy is undergirded by a naturalistic metaphysics that is more immoralist than Hobbes and scarcely to the taste of most modern readers.3 And third, Spinoza remained wedded to certain premodern notions about the difference between the intellectuals and the vulgar which, it is believed, undercut his democratic commitments.4 Here I want to propose a reconsideration of the Treatise as a neglected source of democratic theory. My contention is that Spino za's support of democracy is twofold: first as the regime most consis tent with the modern "scientific" interpretation of natural law and justice and second as the regime most likely to foster the intellectual and rational capacities of its citizens. At the same time that Spinoza advocated democracy as the most rational regime, I want to show that he was keenly aware of the limitations of democratic rule. While he regarded democracy as the best regime (optima Rep?blica), he did not regard it as the highest good (ens perfectissimum) for the individual. In the end there will always be a disproportion between the democratic citizen and the intensely personal, even solitary, char acter of the philosophical life. Before examining the arguments of chapter 16, it is necessary to say something about its place in the architecture of the Treatise as a whole. Beginning with a treatment of prophets and prophecy in the 101-7; Franck Tindal, "Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau et la formation de l'id?e de d?mocratie comme mesure de la l?gitimit? du pouvoir politique," Revue philosophique de la France et de l'?tranger 110 (1985): 195-222. 3 Upon reading the Treatise Hobbes is reported to have exclaimed that the work had "thrown him a bar's length" for "he durst not write so boldly"; John Aubrey, Brief Lives, ed. Andrew Clark (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1898), 357.

He proceeds, then, to a lengthy discus sion of the order and composition of the books of the Torah (8-11), the status of the Gospels (11-13), and the proper relation of faith and philosophy (14-15). This section of the Treatise culminates in Spinoza's announcement of a new "catholic" or universal religion (fi dei universalis) that is said to be nothing more than a distillation of the moral teachings of the prophets and apostles culled from both Testaments. The essence of the Treatise's new moral theology is an unprecedented doctrine of charity and justice interpreted to mean toleration and non-interference with the beliefs of others. Basing this religion on precepts allegedly common to both Judaism and Christian ity, this religion is intended to serve as a civil theology for the new democratic state with Spinoza himself as its secular messiah.5 Chapter 16 begins with the following announcement. "Hitherto [Hue]" Spinoza remarks, "our care has been to separate philosophy from theology, and to show the freedom of thought which such separa tion insures to both" but "it is now time [quare tempus est] to deter mine the limits to which freedom of thought and discussion may extend itself in the ideal state [optima Rep?blica: best regime]."6 Having spent fifteen chapters defending the necessity of freedom of opinion and belief, Spinoza proposes spending the next five showing what, if any, are the limits of that freedom. The question of the limits of liberty is more properly a political than a theological issue. The last five chapters of the Treatise do more than merely an nounce a new subject matter. They mark the beginning of a new approach, a new method to replace the method of scriptural interpre tation and exegesis followed hitherto. Up until now, Spinoza had followed (more or less faithfully) the principle of sola Scriptura, 5 For Spinoza's secular messianism see Steven B.

SMITH reading Scripture by itself alone.7 The purpose of this method of reading, we can now see, has been not to restore or fulfill the biblical prophecies, but to undermine and replace them. Spinoza's reading of Scripture has the purpose of replacing Scripture with reason as the ultimate ground of both theological and political authority. The "turn" announced at the beginning of chapter 16 seeks to replace the "hiero glyphic" morality of the prophets and the apostles with a new rational or "intelligible" ethics of the scientist-philosopher.8 Once Spinoza has completed his reconstruction of biblical theol ogy, he can turn to the construction of the best regime in the last quarter of the work. This regime would be neither the virtuous repub lic of classical antiquity nor the holy city of the Bible but the commer cial metropolis of modernity. The optima Rep?blica of the Treatise is, above all, a democracy. Spinoza's defense of democracy needs to be distinguished from two widely held views in the history of political theory. Contrary to the first view, ironically, the first avowed defender of democracy did not place any great confidence in the wisdom, either actual or potential, of the people as a whole. The multitude is and will remain prone to superstition and credulity so the purpose of politics is to find a means, both institutional and psychological, of restraining the passions. Because rulers and ruled alike are subject to the same passions, democracy is the regime most likely to subordi nate the interests of both subjects and rulers to the interests of the whole. Contrary to the second view, upheld by Hobbes, Bodin, and the politiques, Spinoza did not regard the achievement of peace and the avoidance of conflict as the chief goals of political Ufe.9 As important 7 For Spinoza's hermen?utica! method see Leo Strauss, "How to Study Spinoza's 'Theologico-Political Treatise,' "Persecution and the Art of Writing (Chicago: Free Press, 1952), 142-201; see also Berl Lang, "The Politics of Interpretation: Spinoza's Modernist Turn," Review of Metaphysics 43 (1989): 327-56; Christopher Norris, Spinoza and the Origins of Modern Critical Theory (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1991), 177-215. 8 "Everyone can see the truth of Euclid's propositions before they are proved.

Spinoza endorses the democratic republic because it is the regime most consistent with the autonomous individual or liberated self. Democracy is desirable because it fosters the conditions for reason and the expression of our individual faculties. This democracy bears an uncanny resemblance to seventeenth-century Amsterdam. One can say, with perhaps only slight exaggeration that Amsterdam is for Spinoza the new Jerusalem, a commercial republic based upon freedom of trade, freedom of reli gion, and freedom of opinion.10 Anticipating the title of Gershom Scholem's autobiography, he could almost have subtitled the Treatise "From Jerusalem to Amsterdam." I The new foundation announced in chapter 16 of the Treatise takes its point of departure not from Scripture or revelation but from a new set of allegedly scientific categories like the state of nature, natural right, and the social contract. Needless to say, there is no basis whatsoever in either the Jewish or Christian theological traditions for any of these. To the extent that Spinoza has a predecessor in this effort to establish politics on a new rational foundation, it is his most illustrious (and notorious) contemporary Thomas Hobbes who not long before the publication of the Treatise had declared with his For peace is not the mere absence of war, but a virtue based on strength of mind [ex animi fortitudine]. . . . Besides, a commonwealth whose peace depends on the apathy of its subjects, who are led like sheep so that they learn nothing but servility, may more properly be called a desert than a commonwealth. ...

SMITH characteristic bravado that "civil philosophy" was born with his book De Cive of 1642.n Because Spinoza and Hobbes are often considered together and Spinoza is almost as often regarded as derivative from Hobbes, it is important to emphasize the real differences be tween them. Hobbes and Spinoza both attempt to establish a foundation for the state on a new doctrine of natural right. Where they differ, at least initially, is in their derivation of this right. Hobbes derives natural right from an analysis of individuals in the state of nature by which he means a condition of putative equality prior to or outside the constraints of civil society.12 Equality is derived by Hobbes not from the presence of any positive features or attributes of human beings but from the fact that anyone has the power "either by secret machina tion or by confederacy with others" to kill anyone else. It is because "the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest" that the natural condition emerges as one of maximum distrust and enmity.13 Hobbes hopes to verify this hypothesis by reference not to nature but to human opinion. In the preface to De Cive he remarks that it is "by experience known to all men and denied by none" that "every man will distrust and dread each other" and so by natural right "will be forced to make use of the strength he hath, toward the preservation of himself."14 From his account of the state of nature, Hobbes establishes his idea of the right of nature which is nothing more than the liberty each person has to use his own power for the preservation of life and limb.15 In the state of nature the right of nature is not restricted by any reciprocal duties or obligations. The right of nature gives a grant 11 Thomas Hobbes, De Corpore, in The English Works, ed. Sir William Molesworth (London: Bohn, 1839), l:ix. 12 "Nature hath made men so equal, in the faculties of the body, and mind; as that though there be found one man sometimes manifestly stronger in body, or of quicker mind than another; yet when all is reckoned together, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable, as that one man can thereupon claim to himself any benefit, to which another may not pretend, as well as he"; Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, ed.

Because nature gives us a right to "all things," it follows that the state of nature is "a war of all against all" where a combination of competition for scarce resources, diffidence or desire for security, and glory or love of distinction become the three most important causes of conflict.16 It is because the state of nature is an ultimately absurd situation torn between the conflicting desires to harm others and to escape violent death that men are led to seek peace and form civil society. The laws of nature are those rules derived from the more fundamental right of nature that leads men to compromise their liberty for the sake of a peaceful and secure cohabitation. By contrast to Hobbes, Spinoza presents a very different derivation of natural right. Anticipating by roughly a century Rousseau's later criticism that Hobbes had merely projected the qualities of civil man (diffidence, vanity, competition) back into the state of nature, Spinoza attempts to derive natural right not from a meditation upon human nature but from the power and articulation of nature as a whole: By the right and ordinance of nature, I merely mean those natural laws where with we conceive every individual to be conditioned by nature, so as to live and act in a given way. For instance, fishes are naturally conditioned for swimming, and the greater for devouring the less; there fore fishes enjoy the water, and the greater devour the less by sovereign natural right. For it is certain that nature, taken in the abstract, has sovereign right to do anything she can; in other words, her right is co extensive with her power.17 Spinoza explains himself here in a related passage from the Politi cal Treatise. By "the right and ordinance of nature," Spinoza explains that he means nothing more than "the eternal power of God."18 By the power of God, however, it should be clear by now that he certainly does not mean the intending or providential deity of Scripture. God 16 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 13, p. 81; see also De Cive, chap. 1, pars. 3-6, pp. 113-16. 17 TPT, chap. 16, p. 200; G, 3:189 (12-20). is u^jie p0wer 0f things in nature to exist and act is really the power of God. . . . For since God has the right to do everything, and God's right is simply God's power conceived as completely free, it follows that each thing in nature has as much right from nature as it has power to exist and act; since the power by which it exists and acts is nothing but the completely free power of God"; (emphasis added) PT, chap. 2, par. 3, p. 267; G, 3:276 (27)-277 (2).</page><page sequence="8">366 STEVEN B. SMITH as Spinoza understands Him (or It) is simply a word for the power of nature as a whole. When we speak about God or nature we are in fact speaking of a perfectly homogenous system which can nevertheless be articulated into two parts, extension (res extensa) or matter and cogitation (res cogitans) or thought. Thought and matter are not two different substances as Descartes had believed but rather two "modes" or "attributes" of the same substance that Spinoza calls God or nature (Deus sive natura)}9 From this initial identification of natural right, Spinoza goes on to declare that the right of nature is equivalent to the power of nature. Might equals right. It is by the right of nature that "each individual should endeavour to preserve itself as it is without any regard to anything but itself."20 Note that when Spinoza says each individual he does not mean each human subject, but rather something like each natural kind or species. This is because he does not wish to grant any special priority or privilege to the human order within the natural order. Hobbes attempts to derive natural right from reflection on human nature. "Read thyself" is the motto by which Leviathan ex horts its readers to see whether "the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man" are not identical to "the thoughts and passions of another."21 For Spinoza, human nature is made co-extensive with the comprehensive order of nature. When seen from the perspective of nature, there is simply nothing very special about the human van tage point. Each individual species, whether it be dogs, mules, or human beings, has its own inner drive or urge (conatus) which impels it to seek its own preservation and do whatever is necessary to main tain itself.22 The natural right of human beings rather than a mark of distinction is no loftier or more dignified than that of fish. 19 "That eternal and infinite being we call God, or Nature, acts from the same necessity from which he exists"; Benedict de Spinoza, Ethics in The Collected Works of Spinoza, trans, and ed.

Reason was generally accorded a special place in determing the rules circumscribing the character of the good life. Thus Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics establishes that the good life is the life according to the natural order of the human soul in which reason controls and directs the passions towards virtue. The virtues are in turn determined by right reason (orthos logos) or the habit of choosing our actions wisely.23 Natural right is thus intrinsically bound up with the virtuous life as practiced by the citizen of a well-ordered city. Aristotle's famous statement near the beginning of the Politics to the effect that man is "by nature" (kata physein) a political animal (z?on politikon) and that the polis is also among the things that exists by nature merely completes the virtuous circle.24 Nature favors reason which favors human sociability because it in turn creates conditions favorable to reason. The thesis that the life according to nature is the life of virtue was expounded as well by Cicero and the Stoics and even became an expressed belief of Christian Aristotelianism. Thomas Aquinas argued that the precepts of natural law are embedded in our practical rational ity and as such can be promulgated and understood by all whose reason has not become corrupted.25 Not even Hobbes, for all of his anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical ire, managed to distinguish fully be tween nature and reason. By the laws of nature Hobbes means those rules of prudence that lead men to prefer peace to war. These laws are described variously as "convenient articles," "precepts," or 23 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1.1095al0; 2.1103b31-3; 3.1114b29, 1119a20; 5.1138al0; 6.1138b25, 1144b26-8, 1147b3. 24 Aristotle, Politics, 1.1253a7-38.

SMITH "conclusions" which reason "suggesteth" in order to obtain peace.26 Hobbesian natural right, like Aristotle's, has an ineluctably teleological component to it. It presupposes and thus helps rational beings see the necessity and therewith the goodness of society. Spinoza's derivation of natural right from the more general opera tions of nature presupposes no special dispensation for human reason within the whole.27 This is not because Spinoza is oblivious to the real differences between virtue and vice, the lives of "fools, madmen, and sane men." It is only that from the standpoint of nature, these distinctions have no meaning at all. These are human judgments intended and created for human convenience and do not reflect the natural order and articulation of things. The statement that the state of nature is a state of war (Hobbes) or a condition of peace (Rousseau) is at best a fa?on de parler and at worst a misleading projection of human ends and purposes onto nature as a whole. Such statements may have metaphorical value, but have absolutely no rational or scien tific value. Just as Maimonides had divested the biblical God of all anthropomorphic qualities and attributes, so does Spinoza divest na ture of all claims to favor reason, peace, and virtue to unreason, war, and vice.28 All of these are equally ways of being human and thus equally legitimate when seen from the perspective of God or nature. The practical moral consequence of Spinoza's thoroughgoing natural ism is far from being a counsel of pessimism or despair. Spinoza takes a kind of naturalist's delight and celebration at the sheer variety of distinctive types and their diverse means of preserving themselves.29 26 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 13, p. 84; chap. 15, pp. 104-5. 27 TPT, chap. 16, p. 201; G, 3:189 (30)-190 (10). 28 For the view that Spinoza was a Maimonidean, even if a renegade, see Shlomo Pines, "Spinoza's 'Tractatus Theologico-Politicus,' Maimonides, and Kant," Scripta Hierosolymitana 20 (1968): 3-54; Warren Zev Harvey, "A Portrait of Spinoza as a Maimonidean," Journal of the History of Philoso phy 19 (1981): 151-72. 29 Colerus relates the following revealing story about Spinoza: "He also took pleasure in smoking a pipe of tobacco; or, when he had a mind to divert himself somewhat longer, he look'd for some spiders, and made them fight together, or he threw some flies into the cobweb, and was so well pleased with that battle, that he would sometimes break into laughter. He observed also, with a microscope, the different parts of the smallest insects, from whence he drew such consequences as seemed to him to agree best with his discoveries"; Colerus, "Life of B. De Spinoza," in Frederick Pollock, Spinoza: His Life and Philosophy (London: Duckworth, 1899), 395.</page><page sequence="11">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 369 The teaching of natural right leads Spinoza to the conclusion that from the standpoint of nature all things are permitted. If anything in nature appears to be evil or absurd, Spinoza assures us that this is because we see only the part, not the whole. We should not expect nature to conform to reason because reason is itself a part of nature in comparison to which "man is but a speck."30 The necessity of everything takes away the need for judgments of praise and blame. This is, again, because judgments of good and bad are merely human distinctions relative to us and are of no consequence to the eternal order of nature. Nature may be the ultimate source of our moral distinctions insofar as everything for Spinoza refers back to nature, but nature in and of itself is morally neutral. Nature is neither good nor evil, but in Nietzsche's phrase "beyond good and evil."31 II The question that Spinoza has yet to raise is how, in such a naturalistically determined world, is politics and hence political phi losophy possible. If the human order is as perfectly integrated into the determined order of nature as are fish and birds, how is it that we alone among the species think in terms of good and evil, just and unjust? Why did Spinoza write the Ethics rather than the Origin of the Species? Here Spinoza's answer is roughly that human nature, unlike the natures of lions or dogs, requires human beings to live under the hegemony of laws and government. Human nature, to be sure, exists within the overall order of nature as a whole. He denies that the human can escape or evade the comprehensive order of na ture. Yet within the whole there is a certain heterogeneity of the parts that makes the good for a human being different from that of all other species or creatures. What, then, is that good? The good for human beings is to live in society because only society makes self-preservation and hence liberation from fear a 30 TPT, chap. 16, p. 202; G, 3:190 (30)-191 (10). 31 See Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals, trans.

Reason enjoins men to seek peace and peace cannot be maintained except in the context of a commonwealth (respub lica).32 In one of his rare direct references to Hobbes, Spinoza says the following: Whatever be the social state a man finds himself in, he may be free. For certainly a man is free, in so far as he is led by reason. Now reason (though Hobbes thinks otherwise) is always on the side of peace, which cannot be attained unless the general laws of the state [civitatis] be respected. Therefore the more a man is led by reason?in other words, the more he is free, the more constantly will he respect the laws of his country, and obey the commands of the sovereign power to which he is subject.33 Hobbes' view, to which Spinoza alludes here, seems to have changed over time. In Leviathan he makes it nothing short of "the first and fundamental law of nature" that men ought to endeavour peace whenever they have a hope of attaining it.34 "Make peace not war" is the foremost "suggestion" of reason. Spinoza is here probably thinking of that passage in De Cive where Hobbes identifies reason with the desire for honors and glory for "man scarce esteems anything good, which hath not somewhat of eminence in the enjoyment more than that which others do possess."35 Rather than a cause of civic harmony, the De Cive sees reason as the unique source of our disor ders. Unlike the beasts who use their voice "to signify their affections to each other," humans use their reason to signal "a contestation for honor and preferment." While the other species are able to live in peace without envy and hatred, "the tongue of man is a trumpet of war and sedition."36 The difficulty immediately recognized by Spinoza is that while reason is a part of human nature, even the best part, it is still only a part. Indeed, Spinoza goes further than Hobbes in emphasizing the 32 "The whole teaching of reason is that men should seek peace. But peace cannot be achieved unless the general laws of the state are kept inviolate; and so the more a man is guided by reason . . . the more free he is, the more steadfastly will he observe the laws of the state and carry out his sovereign's commands"; PT, chap. 3, par. 6, p. 289; G, 3:286 (20-5). 33 TPT, chap. 16, p. 276 note; G, 3:263 (20-6). 34 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 14, pp. 84-5. 35 Hobbes, De Cive, chap. 5, par. 5, p. 168. 36 Hobbes, De Cive, chap. 5, par. 5, pp. 168-9.</page><page sequence="13">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 371 rarity of reason. Hobbes had maintained that while human beings may be vain, competitive, and superstitious, there was still a common propensity toward rationality that experience bestows on all. "Rea son," Hobbes wrote in the Elements, "is no less of the nature of man than passion, and is the same in all men."37 Reason is considered here not a faculty of intuiting the essences of things but simply a capacity for calculation. "Reason," he states, "is nothing but Reckon ing," that is, discovering which means are the most appropriate to attain desired ends.38 For Spinoza, however, reason remains a more difficult attainment. Unlike Hobbes, Spinoza seeks to recapture some of the classical dignity of reason as our ens perfectissimum. Reason is not just the ability of making sound calculations, but is connected to the highest good which is contemplation. There is no room for the contemplative ideal in Hobbes' understanding while for Spinoza the highest virtue is connected to the rational intellect.39 The problem remains, then, for Spinoza to explain how political life is possible for human beings who are not only far from perfectly rational but whose capacity for reason may be deeply impaired. The issue is posed as follows. Everyone wishes to live securely, as far as possible from the reach of fear, and this would be impossible if every one merely followed their own desires or if reason were lowered to the level of passions like hatred and envy. As evidence, Spinoza refers the reader back to a passage which he says was "proved" in chapter 5 of the Treatise: Now if men were so constituted by nature that they desired nothing but what is designated by true reason, society would obviously have no need of laws; it would be sufficient to inculcate true moral doctrines; and men would freely, without hesitation, act in accordance with their true interests. But human nature is framed in a different fashion: every one, indeed, seeks his own interest, but does not do so in accordance with the dictates of sound reason, for most men's ideas of desirability and usefulness are guided by their fleshly instincts and emotions, which take no thought beyond the present and the immediate object. There fore, no society can exist without government, and force, and laws to restrain and repress men's desires and immoderate impulses.40 37 Hobbes, Elements, 1, 15. 38 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 5, p. 25. 39 "Knowledge of God is the Mind's greatest good; its greatest virtue is to know God"; E, 4, P28, p. 559; G, 2:228 (7-8). 40 TPT, chap. 5, pp. 73-4; G, 3:73 (27)-74 (3).</page><page sequence="14">372 STEVEN B. SMITH Spinoza adds, as a possible rejoinder to the Hobbesian sovereign, that he does not favor giving the government arbitrary power over the lives of its subjects. "Human nature," he assures the reader, "will not submit to absolute repression" and with reference to Seneca observes that the violent governments perish while "the moderate governments endure [moderata durant]."41 This passage brings to mind another from book 4 of the Ethics where Spinoza gives a succinct but powerful statement of the problem. In the second scholium to proposition 37, Spinoza briefly reviews his doctrine of natural right. Every person, he affirms, exists by sovereign natural right and by that right judges what is good or bad according to his own advantage.42 If everyone exercised their natural right in accord with their reason, there would be no need for government since reason mandates peace and peace mandates mutual respect.43 However, since it is a central thesis of Spinoza's psychology that human beings are prone to superstition and emotion, it follows that the exercise of our natural right puts us directly at variance with one another. Thus if we are to live together in peace it is necessary to forego the exercise of our natural right to all things for a more limited share of right to some things. The condition of mutual forebearance, whereby we agree to limit our natural right, is the legitimate origin of society. Only within the context of society is the exercise of natural right transformed into a moral right. There is nothing in the state of nature either good or bad for the reason, we recall, that nature can be neither good nor bad. Terms of moral distinction have meaning only within society because it is only for the sake of social convenience that they are created at all.44 "There 41 TPT, chap. 5, p. 74; G, 3:74 (3-5). 42 E, 4, P37, pp. 566-7; G, 2:237 (20-6) 43 "Only insofar as men live according to the guidance of reason, must they always agree in nature"; E, 4, P35, p. 563; G, 2:232 (30-1).

This, he believes, is no problem, for reason dictates peace and society. The problem is how to get the irrational to submit, since such persons are perforce deaf to the ministrations of reason. It is no longer an option to construct a regime governed by an omnicompetent philosopher-king. Even if such a person were available, who would listen?46 For Spinoza, this is at best an ersatz solution to a real problem. The trick is to create a lasting and stable society even in the absence of reason or wisdom. Absent, then, the efficacy of reason, what is it that can motivate men to submit to political authority?47 Spinoza's solution to this problem was to become a standard strategem of liberal political theory.48 If reason is powerless to con strain the passions, then what must be found is another emotion suffi ciently powerful to do so. If no one can be compelled to listen to reason, one might at least be persuaded by the promptings of the desire for preservation. Thus if men cannot be induced to seek peace because of their reason, they might still be called to do so because of their fear, especially fear of mistreatment and abuse at the hands of others. By playing off one passion against another, Spinoza enjoins a solution to the problem of political authority even in the absence of a controlling rational intellect.49 45 E, 4, P37, pp. 567-8; G, 2:238 (18-19), 238 (35)-239 (2). 46 "Truly this would be a new form of ecclesiastical authority, and a new sort of priests or pontiffs, more likely to excite men's ridicule than their veneration"; TPT, chap. 7, p. 116; G, 3:114 (30-1). 47 "It is vain to say, that enlightened statesmen will be able to acUust these clashing interests, and render them all subservient to the public good.

Hirshman, The Passions and the Interests (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1977), 20-31. 49 "An affect cannot be restrained or taken away except by an affect opposite to, and stronger than, the affect to be restrained"; E, 4, P7, p. 550; G, 2:214 (22-3).</page><page sequence="16">374 STEVEN B. SMITH The desire for self-preservation is a passion powerful enough to offset the other passions for gain, honor, or simple power over others. It is a "universal law of human nature," Spinoza tells us, that everyone acts either to achieve some good or avoid some evil.50 So long as we remain unprotected by the collective power of law, we are subject to arbitrary treatment and possibly "very great injury" at the hands of others. Outside the bounds of society these injuries are not impermis sable. In the state of nature every person retains full power over his natural right to seek his own preservation co-extensive with his natu ral power to do so.51 No one may legitimately complain of harm any more than the zebra has the right to complain against the lion. The mechanism by which this new authority is established is not that of a prophetic founder bearing divine rewards and punishments, but a social contract maintained through the fear of evil consequences of failing to attend to our promises.52 This proposed solution to the problem of civil authority seems, once again, to come straight out of Hobbes. Here too, however, the differences seem almost as powerful as the similarities. According to Hobbes, on at least one important interpretation, the social contract is made possible by virtue of a prior moral obligation that promises should be kept.53 Even in the state of nature there is a moral law that ought to be respected and which provides the foundation for all civil law. The contract comes into being, then, only because in the state of nature the moral law is ineffective. In Hobbes' terms it is binding in foro interno but not in foro externo.M Civil power exists to make it possible to fulfill peace fully and securely our obligations to the natural law. For Spinoza, the contract derives from no pre-existing moral obli gation, but only out of the convenience of the parties seeking security from conditions of uncertainty. "A compact," he writes, "is only made binding by its utility [pactum nullam vim habere posse, nisi ratione 50 TPT, chap. 16, p. 203; G, 3:191 (34)-192 (2) 51 "There is no sin in the state of nature. ...

A person who hands over his wallet to a robber does so because he believes the loss of his money is a lesser evil than the loss of life. Similarly one hands over the exercise of one's natural right to society because one expects more good than harm to come through the transfer. The contract is not a moral relationship but simply a relation of power. As soon as it becomes advantegeous for anyone to break the terms of the agreement, there is no reason to believe that they will not do so unless, that is, they are restrained by fear of some greater evil.56 The state grows out of a necessity of human nature and should not, therefore, be endowed with a sacred status. This secularization of the state is ultimately Spinoza's answer to the Mosaic theocracy. Ill Chapter 16 of the Treatise is the locus classicus of modern demo cratic theory.57 Unlike the Hobbesian contract which begins from egalitarian premises only to arrive at radically inegalitarian conclu sions, and unlike the Lockean compact intended to limit the power of the sovereign and to preserve the individual's prepolitical rights, Spinoza is not only the first modern thinker to defend democracy as such but to do so on the principle that might makes right. Spinoza was by no means the first person to adopt the view that right equals the interest of the stronger. Here one only needs to recall the speeches of Thrasymachus, Callicles, and several unnamed speakers in Thucy dides.58 Spinoza is, however, the first to draw avowedly democratic policies from the grim fact that big fish eat little fish. 55 TPT, chap. 16, p. 204; G, 3:192 (25-6). 56 TPT, chap. 16, p. 204; G, 3:192 (30)-193 (9). 57 Feuer, Spinoza and the Rise of Liberalism, 101; Stanley Rosen, "Bene dict Spinoza," in History of Political Philosophy, ed.

SMITH Spinoza introduces the idea of democracy not from any idealiza tion of the people, but as a conclusion drawn from the doctrine of sovereignty strictly understood. In this manner a society can be formed without any violation of natural right, and the covenant can always be strictly kept?that is, if each individual hands over the whole of his power to the body politic, the latter will then possess sovereign natural right over all things; that is, it will have sole and unquestioned dominion, and everyone will be bound to obey, under pain of the severest punishment. A body politic of this kind is called a Democracy, which may be defined as a society which wields all its power as a whole.59 The doctrine of sovereignty was Hobbes' answer to the question of how to reduce the state of war and conflict which we find in the absence of civil authority to a condition of peace. The Hobbesian sovereign is the creation of a compact or "covenant" between individu als who, being equal to one another, agree to transfer their natural right to an "artificial person" who can act on behalf of the contracting parties.60 This artificial person, like the biblical sea monster for whom he is named, is entrusted with a grant of absolute power for the sake of establishing and maintaining peace.61 By virtue of the Hobbesian "covenant of union," the sovereign becomes "the absolute representa tive of all the subjects" in everything that he does.62 While Hobbes expressed a certain relative indifference to the form of the regime established by this union, his reference to the sovereign as "one per son" would seem to indicate an unmistakable preference for monar chy.63 Once established the sovereign has the absolute authority to determine the laws of property, to declare war, to establish forms of religion, and to decide which doctrines are fit to be taught.64 Democracy is Spinoza's answer to what he regarded as an unre solved problem in the Hobbesian theory of sovereignty. This is the problem of arbitrary rule following from the investiture of absolute 59 TPT, chap. 16, p. 205; G, 3:193 (19-27). 60 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 16, pp. 105-6. 61 Ibid., chap. 28, p. 209; Hobbes refers here to Job 41:25: "Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear." 62 Ibid., chap. 22, p. 146. 63 Ibid., chap. 17, p. 112; chap. 19, p. 121; De Cive, preface, p. 104; chapter 10, par. 3, pp. 223-4. ^Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 18, pp. 116-17; chap. 30, pp. 224-5.</page><page sequence="19">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 377 power in the hands of one person or body of persons. To be sure, Hobbes was not oblivious to the issue of the abuse of power but thought it a danger more incident to democracies than monarchies. He denies, for instance, that the crimes of Nero or Caligula belong properly to monarchies. Instead he asserts that "in a popular domin ion, there may be as many Neros as there are orators who soothe the people."65 Taking a page from Machiavelli, Hobbes suggests that under a Nero only the ambitious who are "offensive and contumelious" live in danger and in what is almost certainly an autobiographical refer ence he remarks that in a monarchy whoever would lead a "retired life" has nothing to fear "let him be what he will that reigns."66 Spinoza's reply is, surprisingly, not that the Hobbesian sovereign is too strong, but that it is not strong enough. He suggests as much in his only other published reference to Hobbes: With regard to politics, the difference between Hobbes and me . . . consists in this that I ever preserve the natural right intact so that the Supreme Power in a State has no more power over a subject than is proportionate to the power by which it is superior to the subject. This is what always takes place in the state of nature.67 In this admittedly cryptic formulation Spinoza seems to be strug gling to formulate the following thought. The Hobbesian sovereign is not a party to but a creation of the original covenant. No matter how complete the transfer of right may be, the sovereign remains to some degree limited by, and thus dependent upon, the terms of the original agreement. Hobbes' own language shows an ambiguity in prescribing precisely how far the sovereign is able to compel obedi ence. In some places he suggests that the sovereign's power is virtu ally absolute, while elsewhere he acknowledges certain fundamental liberties that not even the sovereign may abridge.68 The problem to which Spinoza is alluding is the difference be tween the sovereign's right and his power to command. This problem is solved in a democracy where in transferring our right to all things 65 Hobbes, De Cive, chap. 10, par. 7, p. 227. 66 Ibid., chap. 10, par. 7, p. 227. 67 The Correspondence of Spinoza, ed. and trans.

SMITH we do so not to a third party but to nothing other than the collective power of a united people. For reasons that Rousseau would develop at length in the Social Contract, Spinoza argues here that everyone may give over all their rights unstintingly to the sovereign. The terms of the contract being the same for everyone, no one need fear putting himself under the arbitrary control of another. There is no unequal division between the power of the people and that of the sovereign. This is what Spinoza means when he says that, unlike Hobbes, he preserves the natural right of the individual "intact." Spinoza is not unaware of the classical objection that even Hobbes echoes regarding the capriciousness of democratic msgorities. Democratic rule was traditionally thought to be inimical both to the rights of minorities and the freedom of the individual.70 Furthermore, democracies were thought to be peculiarly prone to the power of demagogues who could use populist rhetoric to cloak their own pri vate agendas. Spinoza thus has to assure the reader that democracies are not susceptible to this kind of abuse of power. One may, therefore, submit oneself to the sovereign unstintingly and with a "light heart" for in a democracy it is "almost impossible" that the majority would consent to an "irrational design."71 The dangers traditionally associated with democratic rule, then, are considerably abated according to the Treatise because in obeying the laws of the sovereign we do no more than obey ourselves.72 Be cause the sovereign is the power of the people in their collective capacity, there is little likelihood that a people would knowingly harm itself. Spinoza does not consider the force of the Socratic objection 69 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, On the Social Contract, trans, and ed. Roger D. and Judith R. Masters (New York: Saint Martin's, 1978), bk 1, chap. 6, p. 53. 70 "It is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece and Italy, without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the rapid succession of revolutions, by which they were kept in a state of perpetual vibration, be tween the extremes of tyranny and anarchy"; Federalist Papers, no. 9, p. 50; "Hence it is, that such Democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives, as they have been violent in their deaths"; ibid., no. 10, p. 61.

Rather he confidently pro poses that, especially if the majority of a people be large, there is no reason to fear from an "irrational design."73 At one point he comes dangerously close to maintaining that the will of the majority is infalli ble. Since questions of right and wrong only come to light in society, the sovereign alone has the authority to establish the rules of justice. Justice is no more but also no less than what the sovereign says it is.74 The Treatise's ultimate justification of democracy is its enhance ment of human freedom. To a degree developed later by Rousseau and then the German idealists, freedom becomes the true end and purpose of political life. Freedom, however, is understood by Spinoza not as negative but as positive liberty.75 Negative liberty, as the term has come to be used, means essentially the absence of constraints or impediments to action. This kind of liberty, as Hobbes defined it in Leviathan, is the freedom to act or forbear from acting when the laws are silent (silentium legis).76 Law and liberty are regarded from this perspective as mutual antitheses. The purpose of the law is not to enhance liberty but to restrain it and to protect persons from its destructive effects. This is not to say that even Hobbes believed that it was the business of the sovereign to abolish liberty. The sovereign has the right to do only what he has the power to do and no power on earth is sufficient to eradicate the human desire for freedom. "The liberty of man," Hobbes writes, "consisteth in this, that he finds no stop in doing what he has the will, desire, and inclination to do."77 So long as we breathe, we cannot stop willing and desiring. Human 73 TPT, chap. 16, p. 206; G, 3:194 (16-23). 74 TPT, chap. 16, p. 207; G, 3:195 (26-34). 75 For the use of this term see Isaiah Berlin, "Two Concepts of Liberty," in Four Essays on Liberty (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), 118-72.

SMITH life is a progress from one desire to another which ceases only with life itself.78 The Treatise offers a very different idea of liberty, not simply as the absence of impediments to action, but as obedience to one's own reason. The fact of obedience alone does not distinguish the free individual from the slave. Rather he alone is free who lives "whole heartedly" (integro animi) under the guidance of self-imposed law.79 If reason, as we have seen, mandates peace and peace requires society, then freedom consists in obedience to the laws of society. Spinoza is clearly aware of the paradox of this formula that seems to identify freedom with obedience. Merely by the fact that we obey the govern ment, we become free since the alternative would be chaos and hence a complete loss of freedom. But it is one thing to say, as he suggests at one point, that obedience to law, even "absurd" laws, is the lesser of two evils.80 It is quite something else to say that obedience to the law makes one free.81 Where Spinoza most clearly differs from Hobbes and the negative libertarian tradition is in his understanding of the relation between freedom and rationality. Rationality is not simply a means to the satisfaction of our desires and inclinations. It is not and ought not to be a slave to the passions as David Hume said it was. Reason is rather essential for and internally related to the full development of individual liberty. Among other things, reason is not simply an aid to the satisfaction of desire but a form of understanding why we have the kinds of desires that we have. When we understand the causes of our desires, we become in a sense liberated from them. This is not to say that our desires disappear. As embodied creatures, we can never be free of our desires nor does Spinoza believe, as did the Stoics, that the ruthless minimization of our desires contributes to our happiness. His point is that when we undertand the causes of our desires, these desires no longer unconsciously determine our be havior. Our increase in self-understanding is crucial to an enhance ment of our freedom. 78 Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 6, p. 39; chap. 11, p. 63. 79 TPT, chap. 16, p. 206; G, 3:194 (25)-195 (5). 80 TPT, chap. 16, p. 205; G, 3:193 (34)-194 (5). 81 Rousseau, Social Contract, bk 1, chap. 7, pp. 54-5.</page><page sequence="23">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 381 Reason, then, could be said to apply a certain therapy to our desires. It is only by understanding the causes of our desires that we gain power over them. This power in turn enhances our sense of freedom. Spinoza did not go as far as Rousseau and his German followers in the belief that reason could somehow alter the fundamen tal structure of our desires. For Spinoza, as for Hobbes, the fundamen tal desire, the desire of all desires, remains the desire for self-preserva tion.82 But even the bare desire for "persistence" comes to have a new meaning for Spinoza. Persistence means not the sustinence of mere life, nor even of comfortable or "commodious" life, but of the rational life, the life of free self-understanding. Only the life devoted to reason can be fully or completely free. IV It has sometimes been suggested that Spinoza's ethic of positive liberty contains dangerous authoritarian, if not totalitarian, implica tions.83 Liberal politics has generally rested uneasily with the sugges tion that there is a summum bonum, a single best way of life. The idea that there is one supreme end for human life has often gone 82 "The striving by which each thing strives to persevere in its being is nothing but the actual essence of the thing"; E, 3, P7, p. 499; G, 2:146 (20-1). Berlin classifies Spinoza, along with Hegel and Marx, as a partisan of positive freedom and therefore as among the enemies of true liberty; see Berlin, "Two Concepts of Liberty," 142, 146, 147. For an attempt to rescue Spinoza from this association see David West, "Spinoza on Positive Free dom," Political Studies 39 (1993): 284-96. In his rejoinder to this essay Berlin suggests that it is not Spinoza but merely a "distortion" of Spinoza's views which can be "easily twisted" in the direction of paternalism and social control. To this one can only ask whose views are so impervious to misuse that they cannot be maliciously twisted in support of some corrupt purpose? Employing a strategy of guilt by association, Berlin notes that Bismarck "greatly admired" Spinoza and borrowed his tactics in carrying out his Kul turkampf against the clerics of Germany. Berlin fails to note that Spinoza was also "greatly admired" by many more people including Ben Gurion and the founders of the state of Israel; see Berlin, "A Reply to David West," Political Studies 39 (1993): 297. For a more successful effort to rescue Spinoza from the charges of political illiberalism, see Gerald M. Mara, "Liberal Politics and Moral Excellence in Spinoza's Political Philosophy," Journal of the History of Philosophy 22 (1982): 129-50.</page><page sequence="24">382 STEVEN B. SMITH together with the idea that politics should work to force or compel that end. Liberalism has generally been thought to work better with an idea of a summum malum, a highest evil, so that the work of politics should be the more modest business of avoiding harm than maximizing good.84 This issue is obliquely but significantly raised at the end of chapter 16. Spinoza frames the question in terms of a quarrel between the right of the sovereign and divine right. The right of the sovereign, we recall, is itself derivative from natural right. The natural right of any class or species is simply its endeavor (conatus) to preserve itself. The natural right of an organism originates in its power to persist in its own being. Spinoza's definition of natural right is so far intended to be neutral to the differences between human and non-human species. Operating within a severely naturalistic metaphysics, he attempts to articulate the laws of human nature within the comprehensive order of nature as a whole. By nature human beings have the same right as do the members of every other species, that is, the right to preserve themselves by whatever means are at their disposal. Natural right is perfectly coextensive with our natural powers. From the equal right of all persons to exercise their power, Spi noza advocates the doctrine of democratic sovereignty as the form of regime "most natural and consonant with individual liberty (maxime naturale videabtur, et maxime ad libertatem)."85 Democracy is the most natural regime for the crude but compelling reason that the majority in any community contains a greater share of power, and therefore right, than does the minority. Democracy is, therefore, the most natural form of sovereignty from which all other forms are deriv ative. It is also the freest regime because Spinoza believes that the majority would never impose any law that would oppress itself. In a democratic republic where everyone freely agrees to tranfer their rights to the sovereign, no one gains any unfair advantage over anyone else. Democracy is, then, the optima Rep?blica because everyone retains an equal share of the right that they possess by nature. 84 "For there is no such finis ultimus, utmost aim, nor summum bonum, greatest good, as is spoken of in the books of the old moral philoso phers. . . . Felicity is a continual progress of the desire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being still but the way to the latter"; Hobbes, Leviathan, chap. 11, p. 63. 85 TPT, chap. 16, p. 207; G, 3:195 (16).</page><page sequence="25">SPINOZA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 383 The Treatise does not answer the question how people who are described as naturally credulous and prone to superstition can be made rational. By what leap of faith could Spinoza maintain that men who are driven by nothing other than "desire and power" could conclude an agreement to curb their passions and "live with full con sent under the entire guidance of reason?"86 Unlike Plato or Maimon ides, Spinoza does not advocate the rule of a philosopher-king or a prophet who might educate their subjects to a lofty vision of human perfection. Spinoza's politics are, by contrast, starkly anti-perfectibil ian. This is not because he is bereft of an idea of human perfection, but because he doubts that politics or law is the appropriate means by which to achieve it. The distinction between the philosophic few and the unphilosophic many runs like a thread throughout the Trea tise. It is precisely Spinoza's awareness of this difference that pre vents him from straining to overcome it. The task of politics consists not in raising the many to the level of the few, but in creating laws and institutions that would prevent the multitude from giving free vent to their passions. It follows from what has just been said that no one should confuse Spinoza's democratic politics with his conception of the highest good. The highest good for an individual is not merely life nor even the life of the democratic citizen, but the rational life. But he now maintains that no regime, however constituted, can make a people become ratio nal. While the rational life cannot flourish outside of society, no society can actually compel its members to become rational. Rational ity remains an intensely personal commitment transcending, even as it grows out of, regime politics. Not for nothing have readers often found it difficult to square Spinoza's defense of democracy with his passionate commitment to the radical autonomy of the rational life. Spinoza recognizes that the relationship between the rational individ ual and the ordinary run of mankind is a deeply problematic one. He therefore wants to assure his readers that society has nothing to fear from this type of individual while at the same time retaining his empha sis on the utterly solitary character of the philosophic life.87 86 TPT, chap. 16, p. 206; G, 3:195 (2-5). 87 "From this it follows that men who are governed by reason . . . want nothing for themselves that they do not desire for other men. Hence, they are just, honest, and honorable"; E, 4, P18, p. 556; G, 2:223 (15-18).</page><page sequence="26">384 STEVEN B. SMITH In the Treatise the rules circumscribing the rational or philo sophic life are described by the term "natural divine law." The natural divine law is called natural because it is "universal or common to all men [universalem, sive omnibus homnibut communem]."88 That is to say, the natural divine law does not rely upon any specific historical revelation, nor the truth of any particular historical narrative, nor the fulfillment of any ceremonial functions. This law is called divine because it teaches our highest end which is intellectual perfection.89 By intellectual perfection Spinoza explains that he means the knowl edge of God. But the God that emerges in these pages of the Treatise is not the God of mercy and forgiveness, but rather the God of the Ethics, an infinitely extended Substance accessible not through prayer and supplication but through the study of the general mechanistic processes of nature. "The greater our knowledge of natural phenom ena," Spinoza writes, "the more perfect is our knowledge of the es sence of God."90 The implication of this statement is this: since we ourselves are a part or mode of this Substance, it follows that knowl edge of God will necessarily entail a degree of self-knowledge. One could almost say that the injunction to know God is Spinoza's equiva lent to the Socratic dictum to "know thyself." The statement that the highest good of an individual is knowledge of God is intended to effect not just an intellectual but a moral and psychological emancipation on the part of the knower. The knowledge of God is expressed in the closing propositions of the Ethics by the phrase amor Dei intellectualis, the intellectual love of God.91 "The sum and chief precept of the Divine Law is to love God as the highest good . . . not from fear of any pains and penalties, or from the love 88 TPT, chap. 4, p. 61; G, 3:61 (21-2). 89 TPT, chap. 4, p. 59; G, 3:59 (25-6). 90 TPT1, chap. 4, p. 59; G, 3:60 (9-11). 91E, 5, P33, p. 611; G, 2:300 (29-30). For the sources of this doctrine see Harry A. Wolfson, The Philosophy of Spinoza (Cambridge: Harvard Uni versity Press, 1934), 2:302-11; Harvey, "A Portrait of Spinoza as a Maimoni dean," 167, claims a distinctively Maimonidean lineage for this notion; see Moses Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed, trans.

In understanding the causes of our actions and desires, we cease to submit passively to them but submit them to the control of our own intellect. This knowledge is said to bring in turn a kind of secular redemption attainable only through the development of one's own reason. Such knowledge is redemptive because it liberates the knower from dependence on and submission to unrefined passions and desires; it is secular because the love of God means essentially the love of ourselves.94 The intellectual love of God is identical to what Spinoza else where in the Ethics calls "knowledge of the third kind."95 This is not some kind of mystical intuitionism uncommunicable by ordinary discourse, although this may have been what led to the rehabilitation of Spinoza by the German romantics.96 Instead, as we have seen before, Spinoza is notorious for using traditional religious language 92 TPT, chap. 4, p. 60; G, 3:60 (34)-61 (5). 93 "Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue itself"; E, 5, P42, p. 616; G, 2:307 (27-9). 94 Contemporary philosophers have had little patience with Spinoza's idea that philosophy issues into a kind of love; for one of the more bad tempered responses Jonathan Bennett says that "the time has come to admit that this part of the Ethics has nothing to teach us and is pretty certainly worthless." Shortly thereafter he remarks that this material from the Ethics is "rubbish which causes others to write rubbish." He ends by pronouncing that "those of us who love and admire Spinoza's philosophical work should in sad silence avert our eyes from the second half of Part 5." See Bennett, A Study of Spinoza's Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), 372, 374, 375. Would that the author had followed his own advise and passed over this part in "silence." The relationship between philosophy and erotics is a theme utterly incomprehensible to Bennett's point of view; this relation ship is, however, as old as philosophy itself, the classic of which is Plato's Symposium. 95 E, 2, P40 note 2, p. 478; G, 2:122 (15-30). 96 The conception of Spinoza as a "God intoxicated man" (Gott trunkener Mensch) was popularized by Novalis. For Spinoza's role in the Pantheismusstreit during the 1780s see F. H. Jacobi, "?ber die Lehre des Spinoza" in The Spinoza Conversations Between Lessing and Jacobi, trans. G. Vall?e, J. B. Lawson, and C. G.

SMITH and imagery to mask or conceal his new, fundamentally irreligious teachings. Even while he says that this third kind of knowledge entails "an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God," it is clear from the immediate context and elsewhere that he means nothing more (but nothing less) than a rational knowledge of the natural processes in which we are embedded.97 The intellectual love of God is not intended to effect the mystical obliteration of the knowing self in some kind of unio sacra with the divine. Rather it lends itself to an ever more intense awareness of one's own individual ity. The intellectual love of God is only complete when knowledge of nature contains the intensely held feeling of personal satisfaction, even joy, that comes from the exercise of our own reason.98 Knowledge of the third kind does not derive, then, from some type of mystical insight different from and inaccessible to the ordinary forms of knowledge acquired through reason and the senses. Toward the end of the Ethics Spinoza makes a point of reinforcing the claim that knowledge of the third kind is "intellectual," not emotional or imaginative: From the third kind of knowledge, there necessarily arises an intellec tual love of God. For from this kind of knowledge there arises joy, accompanied by the idea of God as its cause, i.e. love of God not insofar as we imagine him as present, but insofar as we understand God to be eternal. And this is what I call intellectual love of God.99 Knowledge of the third kind grows out of a form of intellectual synthesis where the confused and inadequate ideas we already possess are made more coherent by being placed within a single comprehen sive system of knowledge. This system is the metaphysics of Sub stance of which everyone and everything is a part. Only when we begin to see ourselves as part of the comprehensive order of nature can the psychology of fear be transformed into the psychology of love. Not only is metaphysics, then, Spinoza's own preferred form of mental 97 E, 2, P40, note 2, p. 478; G, 2:122 (17-19). 98 ?Thg Ethics is necessarily an ethics of joy: only joy is worthwhile, joy remains, bringing us near to action, and to the bliss of action. . . .

His ruthlessly naturalistic psychology, which identifies might with right, has found few adherents. His belief that the rule of the stronger, that is, popular sovereignty, is most likely to ensure freedom of opinion and a "liberal spirit" (liberum ingenium) has been met with more skeptical views of the power of democratic majorities.101 These anomolies notwithstanding, the Treatise gave an important impulse to later developments of modern democratic thought. Its conception of a democratic republic centered on freedom and supported by a civil religion was an important source for Rous seau.102 Spinoza's belief that reason contributes to an increase in our sense of freedom understood as power and agency inspired German idealism from Kant to Hegel. At the same time his conception of the divine law points to a model of individual perfection that concerns at most a few rare human types.103 Spinoza makes clear that this difference between the few and the many is not merely a contingent fact of society or history to be overcome at some future end point. It is a necessity of nature 100 peuer suggests without the slightest trace of irony that there is a significant degree of "gallows humor" and a "strain of masochism" in Spino za's injunction to love God; he entirely misses the degree to which love of God is for Spinoza inseparable from self-love.

SMITH expressing the psychological difference between the wise who live according to ratio and the vulgar who live according to appetitus.104 The idea that the ultimate terms of perfection are the province of a few scientist-philosophers has inevitably brought with it the charge that Spinoza's model of excellence is aristocratic and elitist, at odds with the premises of democratic theory.105 To this one can only respond that Spinoza's model of perfection is elitist but also deeply apolitical. For this reason it need not contra dict his commitment to democracy as the optima Rep?blica. The natural divine law does not issue in the command that philosophers should rule. The intellectual love of God is not something that can be imposed on others, but must be exercised by each individual ac cording to his or her own abilities. Spinoza's is a radically private or personal idea of freedom for which the instrument of politics is simply inappropriate. As the prophet of the newly liberated self, Spinoza exhorts his readers to rely on their own powers of reason and judg ment for the attainment of this ideal. Such a self is likely to seek not domination of, but freedom from, the community to pursue this all consuming passion. In the end the Treatise shows how it is possible to remain a democrat while awarding life's highest prize to the plea sures of the solitary.
