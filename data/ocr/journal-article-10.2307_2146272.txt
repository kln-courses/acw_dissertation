<plain_text><page sequence="1">Volume LXXIV September 1959 Nunmber 3 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY CONTINGENCY IN HISTORY* T NHERE are two different ways of tlhinking about historical development for which consideration is asked here. It would be found, I believe, that miost of the historians who have concernecl themselves wvith the philosophy of history have followed the way of determinism, anid that the same is true of most of the philosophers who have concerned themselves writh his- tory. They have tended to look upon the couLrse of events in the lhuman past-at least in its broad outlines-as predetermined. Some of them, however, have been impressed by what seemed to them like chance occurrences and their momentous consequences. In metaphysics determinism has been questioned, and even de- nied, especially in the realm of the human will. But libertari- anism lhas not exerted an influence comparable to that of deter- ininism on historical interpretation. A determinist interpretation of history accords as well with dialectical materialism as with theological idealism, with Karl Marx as with St. Augustine. Historical interpretation has always been influenced, of course, by prevailing intellectual climates. In what have been called the great ages of religious faith, wvlhen theology was the acknowledged "Queen of Sciences" and history was written by churchmen, past events were viewed as having taken place under an over- ruling, supernatural and anthropomorphic Providence. The course of history was seen as an unfolding of the changeless Will of God, by which it was purposefully directed toward its pre- (lestined end. A vast deal of history, from first to last, has been written in the shadow of St. Augustine and the theological doctrine of predestination. The Augustinian school of historical interpretation held sway for well over a thousand years. We do not generally think of the seventeenth century as falling 321 l An address delivered at the Annual Meeting of the Pacific Coast Branchl of the American Historical Association held at Whittier College, California, December 29, 1958.</page><page sequence="2">322 L POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV within the great ages of faith, but St. Augustine was very much alive in that century, when Bishop Bossuet wrote his famous Discourse on Universal History, in which he upheld Divine Providence against those followers of Descartes who were arguing for a mechanical theory of the universe and the invariability of laws of nature, another variety of determinism. Bossuet was profoundly iinpressed by the long continuity of Jewvish-Christian religious ideas, from the beginning of history (that is, from the Creation as recounted in Genesis) to his own day, while a suc- cession of ephemerally great empires had risen and fallen, and he believed that this spiritual stability in such an unstable secu- lar world could be explained only by reference to Providence. All history, according to Bossuet, was permeated with Divine purpose and controlled by Divine will, a conspicuous illustration of which was to be found in the establishment of the Roman Empire, which united under a single rule many different peoples formerly alien to one another, as a means employed by Provi- dence for the spread of the Christian Gospel. (It is unnecessary to ask here whether these ideas were original with Bossuet.) He admitted that miracles were no longer common in his day, and he believed it to be the will of God that there should be lower and particular causes, and that, except in a few extraordinary instances in which God had willed that his hand should appear alone, no great changes in human affairs had occurred wvithout causes in preceding ages. But above all such lower causes wvas a hligher and ultimate cause. He said: Let tis talk no m-iore of chance [hazard], or of fortune, or let us talk of them only as of a name with which to cover our ignorance. What is chance from the point of view of our uncertain counsels is a design determined upon in a higher counsel, that is, in that etemal counsel which includes all causes and all effects in one and the same end of things. Thus everything concurs to the same end, and it is for want of understanding the whole that we find chance, or irregu- larity, in particular instances. Various ideas have been propounded since Bossuet which take the place of the older theological determinism in historical interpretation, and in which contingency is equally ruled out, or regarded as causally insignificant. Such, for instance, is the Zeitgeist, which started somewhere east of the Rhine and has run such a prosperous course, serving at the beck and call of many an hiistorical manipulator. Such, perhaps, is always the</page><page sequence="3">No. 3] CONTINGENCY IN HISTORY 323 "fundamental cause", the causa causans, singled out by historians who cannot rest content with multiple causation. The idea of a determining cause in history is to be regarded, it seems to me, as an a priori assumption rather than as anything analogous to a scientific hypothesis. For a scientific hlypothesis must be such that it is capable of being confirmed or confuted by empirical evidence, and no historical evidence would necessi- tate the acceptance or the abandonment of a belief in Provi- dence, or the Zeitgeist, or any "fundamental cause", as the ultimate, determining cause in historical development. If such a belief is held, or if it ceases to be held, this is not because it has been shownZ to be true, or untrue, but rather because of the intellectual climate. But why talk, it may be asked, about Providence or any sub- stitute conception of ultimate causation? Serious historians, it may be said, are not influenced by such notions any more. This is the age of science. Yes, this is an age in which natural science, pure and applied, occupies a position and enjoys an intellectual prestige comparable to that of theology in the ages of religious faith, and the blessed word science has broad coattails. We have all kinds of sciences known to our prestige-seekers, to our adver- tisers as wvell as to our universities. Historians, surely, could not escape the influence of science, especially of the biological sci- ences, from which it was easy to transfer concepts to social evolution-the concept of organism, struggle for existence, sur- vival of the fittest, for examples. Augustine and Bossuet are not patron saints of our present-day historical associations, and history is no longer written-at least not much of it-from the premise of theological predestination. But it would be rash to assert that habits of thought formed when theology was the queen of sciences have contributed nothing to the attitude of modern historians who think of their point of view as scientific. These habits of thought, indeed, probably go far to explain, historically, the acceptance by scientists themselves of a principle which has underlain all thinking in the physical sciences, a principle more general than any particular scientific law, the principle of causality. According to this, everything that has happened in nature has been preceded by a continuous chain of cause and effect. What led to the triumph of this principle were regularities observed in nature, notably in the motions of heavenly boclies.</page><page sequence="4">324 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV Nature was presumed to be strictly law-abiding, and the founders of modern physical science-Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and the rest-agreed with the theologians at least in this, that they attributed the semblance of chance in nature to human igno- rance. They had faitlh to believe that if knowleclge could be extended sufficiently, all events in nature would be seen to be causally determined. It was, however, in minds conditioned by the idea of theological determinism that the scientific conception of causation arose. Those who first used the expression "laws of nature" in the scientific sense-and it seems not to have been used in this sense before the seventeenth century-thought of those laws as commands given by God to matter. "Laws im- pressed on matter by the Creator" is a phrase used by Darwin in The Origin of Species. When Newton called his laws of motion leges he was using a word that connoted legislative enactment. The conception of law as command was taken over by science from theology and jurisprudence, and scientific law, the divine law of the theologians, and what the jurists called "the law of nature" were all thought of as emnanating fromn a supernatural lawgiver and as concomitant parts of a single world schemne. Even nowadays scientists, including those who have actually discarded the principle of causal determinism, continue to speak of phenomena obeying laws, but this, I take it, is nothing more than a survival of anthropomorphic metaphor. Scientific law and jural law have traveled far apart. The former has come to inean a generalized statement regarding natural phenomena, that may be in the form of a mathematical equation but need not be so, which is entitled to be considered a law only because it has been tested by observation and always found to be confirmed by empirical evidence. Law in the other sense is a rule of human behavior, which may be, and sometimes is, violated without ceasing to be law. If what has been regarded as scientific law is violated by the phenomena, you cannot punish the lawbreakers. You have to modify the law, as has been done again and again in the history of science. About a generation ago, in 1923 to be precise, Professor Edward P. Cheyney of the University of Pennsylvania was presi- (lent of the American Historical Association. He was a distin- guishecl historian who engaged in research in a number of fields in European history; he is probably best remembered for his</page><page sequence="5">No. 3] CONTINGENCY IN HISTORY 325 work in the history of Tudor England. He chose as the title of his presidential address "Law in History", from which the following sentences are quoted: Examined closely, weighed and measured carefully, set in true perspective, the personal, the casual, the individual influences in history sink in significance, and great cyclical forces loom up. Events come of themselves, so to speak; that is, they come so consistently and unavoidably as to rule out as causes not only physical phe- nomena, but voluntary human action. . . . Providence, fate, destiny, law, has controlled the affairs of man . . . as it controls all things. Human history, like the stars, has been controlled by immutable, self-existent law, by what Mr. Gladstone in his sonorous eloquence once described in Parliament as "those great social forces which move on in their might and majesty, and which the tumult of our debates does not for a moment impede or disturb." Professor Cheyney proceeded, with all due modesty (for he was the most modest of men) and without any pretense to finality, to formulate certain tendencies which he believed to be dis- coverable in history, and which he thought of as laws of history. They were six in number, and I enumerate them merely to shoNv the kind of thing he had in mind: (1) a law of continuity, (2) a law of impermanence, illustrated, for example, by the fall of historic empires, (3) a law of interdependence-of individu- als, of classes, of nations-(4) a law of democracy, (5) a law of necessity for free consent, and (6) a law of moral progress. Being an optimist, Professor Cheyney looked forward to some future meeting of the American Historical Association "when the search for the laws of history and their application will have become the principal part of its procedure", when "the most conspicuous place on the program will be assigned to some gifted young historical thinker who . . . will propound and demonstrate to the satisfaction of all his colleagues some newv and far-reaching law or laws of history." Now if human history has been controlled by "immutable, self-existent law", no fault can be found with Professor Cheyney's opinion that "the personal, the casual, the individual influences in history sink in significance". Even if the Armada of 1588 had carried out its assignment and successfully convoyed a Spanish army from the Netherlands to England, it would not have mat- tered in the long run. Professor Cheyney was specific as to this: "Whether a Spanish or an English wind blew on a certain day</page><page sequence="6">326 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV really made little difference. England was bound to remain independent of Spain." I come now to the other historical point of view. When I first read Seeley's Expansion of England, fifty years and more ago, these sentences made a lasting impression on me: Ilistorians are sometimes ridiculed for in-dulging in conjectures about what wvould have followed in history if some one event had fallen out differently. . . . I think historians should deal in them much more than they do. It is an illusion to suppose that great public cvents, because they are on a grander scale, have something more fatally necessary about them than ordinary private ones, and this illusion enslaves the judgment. The same thought seems to have been in the mind of a professional philosopher who took a deep interest in history and gave much reflection to it, the late Morris R. Cohen, when he remarked in his book, Reason and Nature, that we can no more appreciate the historical significance of Napoleon without asking what might have happened if he had been killed in his first battle than we can realize the climatic significance of the inclination of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit without asking what would have happened had there been no such in- clination. The kind of imagination that Seeley and Cohen had in mind is quite different from daydreaming, from the idle and unrestrained fancy that builds castles in the air. It comes into play only in historically informed minds, just as scientific imagi- nation comes into play only in scientifically trained minds. The historian must, of course, or at least he ought to, strive by thor- ough and critical use of sources available to him to ascertain what actually happened. But if he is concerned with its signifi- cance, he should also ask himself what might have happened-for example, if the Armada had been successful. Imagination is an indispensable prerequisite for appraising historical significance, and I submit that it ought to be recognized as such in the train- ing of historical scholars. If I have any message to give you today, this is it. Those to whom it is congenial to assume that the course of human events has been predetermined, who find such a belief intellectually satisfying and spiritually comforting, will no doubt retain it. But it is not a helpful assumption for the student who aspires to recapture the spirit of a past age and estimate the</page><page sequence="7">No. 3] CONTIANGENCY IN HISTORY 327 significance of its achievements, who seeks to understand the joys and sorrows, the hopes and fears, the anxieties and tensions, which its men and women experienced. In our daily doings our outlook is not deterministic. We habitually think, and act on the tacit assumption, that choice, within certain ranges, is open to us, and that our future will be affected, to some extent at least, by our choices. In the language of theology we are Arminians rather than Calvinists, or, if you prefer to go farther back, Pelagians rather than Augustinians. This familiar point of view is more likely, I believe, to give us historical under- standing than the great booming destiny-concepts of an Oswald Spengler. In a penetrating study that Maitland made of a medieval English parliament, which proved to be a landmark in parliamentary studies, he said, in speaking of the distorting effects of after-mindedness in historical thinking: "It is hard to think away out of our heads a history which has long lain in a remote past but which once lay in the future." Granted that this is hard, it is what the student of history who seeks to enter into communion with a past age, to comprehend its interests and its sense of values, must try to do. A number of historians, and near-historians, have tried their hands at imaginary history, some with serious purpose, some (it may be suspected) in a spirit of literary virtuosity. George MIacaulay Trevelyan once w.on a prize for the best essay on the subject "If Napoleon Had Won the Battle of Waterloo". The most serious work of this nature that I know of was written by the nineteenth-century French philosopher Charles Bernard Renouvier. In opposition to the dogma of necessity in history, and especially against the belief in necessary progress independ- ent of human volition, held by followers of Hegel and followers of Comte and by many French socialists, Renouvier upheld the principle of libertarianism and the belief in contingency in history, and he developed them at length in his philosophical uritings. He made an experiment in imaginary history, which bears the title Uchr-onie, meaning Nowhen, as Utopia means Nowhere. It was published in 1876, with this descriptive sub- title: Esqzi,sse hlistoriquie apocryphe du developpemnent de la cizilisation eutropeene tel quc'il n'a pa,s ete, tel quc'il alurait pu etre. It begins toward the close of the second century after Christ, at the end of the age of the Antonines, and in it the familiar landmarks and historical periods are missing. There is</page><page sequence="8">328 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV no Fall of Rome, no Barbarian Invasions, no Middle Ages. Whatever else may be thought of Uchronie, it ought not to be thought of as just a stunt of imagination. It was intended to be a serious contribution to the philosophy of history, and it emphasizes the conclusion that follows if one accepts libertarian- ism and contingency in history, namely, that it is not only the details, the "non-essentials", that might have been different, but also the framework of history in its generalized outline. Looking at the idea of necessary progress from an ethical point of view, Renouvier believed not only that it had an enervating effect on the individual but that it demoralized history by its implication that what has actually taken place was not only necessary but that it was also good. Morris Cohen, who may, or may not, have been acquainted with Renouvier's writings, attributed what he called "the glorification of the historically actual" to "a lack of sympathy or imagination which prevents us from seeing all the finer possibilities, hopes, and aspirations, at the expense of which the triumph of the actual is frequently purchased." # * * Before going further let me say (though it may be superfluous) that I have not enjoyed the advantages of scientific or philo- sophical training, to say nothing of theological training. But it is my understanding, from having dipped into some of the writ- ings of physicists intended for popular consumption, that in their domain of natural science eminent masters are to be found on both sides of the question of Determinism versus Indeter- minism. The old historical determinism had a theological basis. The support which modern historical determinism has had has come mainly from the scientific doctrine of causation. A well- informed popularizer of scientific developmnent, J. W. N. Sulli- van, remarked in an article published twenty years or so ago that we had assented to the possibility of determinism in human behavior "because we thought that science had proved that determinism was triumphant in the external world, and we thought that what applied to matter might . . . apply to man." It turns out, however, that the so-called law of causality, as it was held in classical physics, has been distinctly weakened during, the last generation. Charles Beard expressed the opinion, and he did so in all seriousness, that the word "cause" ought never to be used in historical writing. This may seem to us prettyt drastic. But the</page><page sequence="9">No. 3] CONTINGENCY IN HISTORY 329 search for "fundamental" or "paramount" causes in history is, so at least it seems to me, necessarily futile. For, prior to every historical event there was an indefinite number of other events, and since historians cannot employ the experimental methods of the laboratory, they have no means of ascertaining which among these antecedent events were necessary conditions of the event in question, and which (if any) among the latter were determining, or fundamental, causes. In a high-school textbook of American history by David S. Muzzey, which was widely used, there appears this sentence: "The defeat of Blaine was attributed to various causes-the Mugwump revolt, the Burchard incident, . . . the last flicker of Stalwart revenge in Conkling's refusal to support his old rival, the commercial depression and 'panic' of 1884, and the bad weather on election day." Let us assume for present purposes that this is an exhaustive list of the causes of the defeat of Blaine, though of course it is not and Muzzey did not present it as such. How can we measure their relative influ- ence and compare the effects, say, of commercial depression with those of the partisan indiscretion of an overzealous clergyman? We cannot reset the stage, call back the actors, and repeat the election of 1884, eliminating one antecedent and then another, and recording the differences in the result. We have no right to say that the Mugwump revolt was more fundamental or more decisive or even more important as a cause of the defeat of Blaine than the rain on election day was. The only advantage it seems to have over the bad weather is that it is a better talking point. You can say more about it. But the effectiveness of an antecedent is not to be measured by the number of words that can be used in discussing it. Causation in history is always multiple, and to single out any one antecedent as a fundamental cause is a highly subjective operation. On this point some words of John Stuart Mill mav be worthy of attention. In a chapter on "Universal Causation" in his System of Logic, Mill pointed out that causal sequence is seldom, if ever, between a consequent and a single antecedent. It is usually [he said, and this is always the case wvith historical c.ausation] between a consequent and the sum of several antecedenlts, the concurrence of all of them being requisite to produce . . . the consequent. In such cases it is very common to single ouit one only of the antecedents uinder the denomination of Cause, calling the others merely Conditions. . . . The real Cause, however, is the wAhole of these antecedents; and wve have, philosophically speaking, no right</page><page sequence="10">330 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV to give the name of cause to one of tlem, exclusively of the others. . . .in practice, that particular condition is usually styled the cause, whose share in the matter is superficially the mnost conspicuous, or whose requisiteness to the production of tlle effect, we happen to be insisting on at the moment. The historian ought, I submit, to banish "fundamental" causes from his thought and from his vocabulary. In a lecture delivered at Cambridge University in 1929 and published with the title The Causal and the Casual in HistorY, John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir and Governor General of Canada) made some remarks which strike me as sensible: In the kaleidoscope of the past we cainnot, as a rule, sort out effects and causes with any precision, nor can we N-eigh events in the meticulous scales w7hich science demands. Even when causes are reasonably plain, their classificationi eludes us. Wre cannot tell whliiclh is the causa causans, w.!hich are proxinmate, or efficient, or final. WVe must be content with generalizations Nvhich are only generalizations and not laws, with broad effects and massed colors. Buchan, it may be added, was a novelist and, more to our point, a biographer and a military historian. For, of all the branches of history, the military and the biographical are per- haps the least hopeful for historical interpretations in terms of Mr. Gladstone's "great social forces." The most Zeitgeist-riddenl historian would find it difficult to persuade his readers, even if not to persuade himself, that General Desaix hlad to arrive on the battlefield of Marengo just in time to turn into a victory for Napoleon what had had every appearance of imminent irre- trievable disaster. It would be easier to leave Marengo out, even though there is excellent reason for regarding it as critical in Napoleon's career. It would be much easier to leave General Desaix out, which is wvhat Napoleon actually did in his report of the battle. The factor of contingency in history has been touclhed upon in some articles published during the last few years in the sump- tuous historical magazine which has been so successful in ap- pealingz to a wide range of readers, American Heritage. In one of these Professor Richard B. Morris dealt with the Albany Plan of Union of 1754, of which Benjamin Franklin was the architect. It provided for an intercolonial union within the British Empire, with a federal government empowered to impose taxes and pmvide for a continental army. Had it been adopted, the revolt of the colonies twenty years later might well have been averted.</page><page sequence="11">No. 3] CONTINGENCY IN HISTORY' 331 This opinion can claim in its support something more historical than the conjecture of a modern historian. In an article pub- lished in a magazine in 1789, thirty-five years after the failure of his Plan, Franklin wrote that if it had succeeded and an intercolonial army had been established for colonial defense, a British army quartered in the colonies for that purpose would have been unnecessary. "The pretenses for framing the Stamp Act", he continued (and we recall that the Stamp Act was passed by Parliament in order to raise revenue to provide for the sup- port of such an army), "would then not have existed, nor the other projects for drawing a revenue from America to Britaiin by acts of parliament, which were the cause of the breach, and attended with such terrible expense of blood and treasure; so that the different parts of the empire might still have remained in peace and union." Franklin, it may be thought, was not a disinterested judge of the importance of his own Plan, but this opinion of his does not seem to lack cogency. And it is a good example of historical imagination-in this case imagination on Franklin's part. And now for a very brief excursion in the boundless field of imaginary history. Let us go back quite a way-four hundrecl years and a little more. And first a word of authentic histoiv by way of introduction. A Spanish queen was seated on the throne of England, the first reigning queen, incidentally, in English history, at least since the Norman Conquest. I call her Spanish not so mutich because Mary Tudor happened to be the daughter of Catharine of Aragon and granddaughter of Ferdinand and Isabella as because her filial devotion, for reasons easily understandable and generally well known, was to her revered and injured mother, and not to her father, fromn whose matrimonial insta- bility she had suffered so grievously; and because her Spanishrv was strengthened by her marriage, early in her short reign, to her Habsburg cousin, who was given the title of King of England and was very soon to become King of Spain as Philip II. It wvas lher fondest wish and her ardent prayer that she might bear him a child, preferably a son, and she believed that it Nvas her mnission to do so. Now suppose that Mary's prayer had been grantecl. At helr death the Tudor dynasty would have come to an end, to be</page><page sequence="12">332 POLITICAL SCIEN'CE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXXIV followed by a Habsburg dynasty. Even if the English and Spanish crowns had not been united on the same head, it seems extremely probable, to say the least, that there would have been a close dynastic alliance between the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Habsburg rulers of England, something like the Family Compact which actually came into existence in the eighteenth century between the Bourbon rulers of France and the Bourbon rulers of Spain. And we do not forget that Spain was a greater Power than England in the sixteenth century, as France was a greater Power than Spain in the eighteenth. Can we seriously suppose, is it really thinkable, that the course of English history after the middle of the sixteenth century would have been in all essentials the same as it actually was-if Mary's prayer had been granted? What about English oversea expansion? Its beginnings, as things actually were, date from the reign of Mary's half-sister, Queen Elizabeth, and her war with Spain. But if Mary's prayer had been granted, there would have been no Queen Elizabeth to encourage English sea dogs in their buccaneering raids on Spanish trade and Spanish treasure, in their bold defiance of Philip's claim to the whole of the New World. A principal argumnent during Elizabeth's reign in favor of English coloniza- tion was that English settlements in America would be useful as bases for naval attacks on Philip's treasure fleets transporting the silver of Mexican and Peruvian mines to Spain. But there would have been no war between England and Spain-if Mary's prayer hadi been granted. If we take our stand at the death of Queen Mary, in 1558, it would be difficult to find contemporary evi- dence pointing to a great future for England as a colonizing nation. She did not need outlets for an expanding population; the population of England and Wales was probably not over three millions. And in maritinme activity and geographical ex- ploration England was distinctly backward. Would a Habsburg dynasty in England have been likely to encourage English coloni- zation in Spain's preserves, and would English colonization have been possible without government sanction and backing? And what about the English parliament? Was its future, as that is known to us, assured? Might it not, indeed, have come to an end like the States-General in France, which, as the text- books remind us, met in 1614 and never met again till 1789? We know what the policy of the Spanish Habsburgs was with</page><page sequence="13">No. 3] CONTINGENCY' IN 1HISTORl' 333 regard to assemblies of estates in their dominions more or less similar to the English parliament. It was to get rid of them. In Castile and Aragon, for example, the old mnedieval cortes ceased to exist. Henry VIII had found parliament useful in his quarrel with the papacy; Mary found it useful in restoring papal supremacy. If Habsburg rulers in England had not found it useful, they would probably have followed the example of their Spanish cousins and refrained from summoning it. An England without a parliament may seem to us an anomaly, but is not that because "it is hard to think away out of our heads a history which has long lain in a remote past but which once lay in the future"? And what of religion in England? The essentials of Catholic worship and the supremacy of the papacy over the English Church, both restored during Mary's reign, would presumably have been continued under a Habsburg and therefore, needless to say, a Catholic dynasty. Is it inconceivable that a Spanish Inquisition would have been imported into England and Protes- tantism overwhelmed in a persecution which would have made the fires of Smithfield pale into insignificance? What has been said should not be taken to imply an opinion on my part that historians ought to so concentrate on what look like accidents as to neglect the effects on historical development of such factors as geography, climate, race, economic conditions, social habits, religious beliefs, philosophical systems. It is in- tended, rather, as a plea for finding a place in historical interpre- tation for the influence of the contingent, for the vagaries of that unpredictable goddess Fortuna, who is ever intervening in historical causation. For, as Sir Llewellyn Woodward has sug- gested, even tlhough what is called "chance" may be something which, in its own field, is strictly detelrnined, the determination is outside the knowledge of the historian. We need not believe that "the vind bloweth where it listeth." But grante(d that the (lirection and velocity of the wind which was blowing over the battlefield of Marengo at a certain time of a certain day in the year 1800, and which carried the sound of the cannonading to the ears of General Desaix, who was several miles away, were determined by physical causes, that deternination is ouitside the knowledge of the historian.
