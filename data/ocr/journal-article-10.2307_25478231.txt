<plain_text><page sequence="1">TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA Prudence M. Rice Time is an abstract concept that has been examined relatively less by Americanist archaeologists as compared to Euro peanists. The lack of consideration of time is particularly curious among Mayanists, because the Classic Maya assiduously recorded events in the lives of rulers and their kingdoms according to time's passage in multiple, precisely calibrated cal endars. This essay examines some of the ways in which time has been conceptualized, and its political and economic roles explored, by anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and others. I apply these findings to the evolution of calendars in Mesoamerica and their function in underwriting early leadership positions, such as that of shamans or "daykeepers." I explore the role of time in structuring late (Postclassic) Maya geopolitical organization and the possibility that such prin ciples also guided that of the Classic Maya. Time, calendars, and particularly the movements of the sun came to be viewed as being "controlled" by Maya sacred kings, aided by their retinue of daykeepers/calendar priests. This awesome cosmo political power led to the identification of the king with the sun and his legitimization through control of the means of social and cosmic reproduction. El concepto abstracto del tiempo ha sido estudiado relativamente poco por los arqueologos americanistas en comparacion con los europeanistas. La carencia de consideracion del tiempo es particularmente curioso entre los mayanistas, porque los may as cldsicos proporcionaron mucha atencion al recordar eventos en las vidas de los soberanos y sus senorios segun elpasaje del tiempo en varios calendarios precisamente calibrados. Este ensayo tiene por su tema algunas de las maneras en que el tiempo fue conceptualizado y sus rots politicos y economicos, por los antropologos, sociologos, historiadores y otros. Aplico algunos de estos observaciones a la evolucion de los calendarios en Mesoamerica y su papel en suscribir los posiciones de liderazgo, como el de los shamanes o de los guardianes del tiempo ( "daykeepers "). Investigo el rot del tiempo en estructurar la organizacion geopolitica postcldsica y la posibilidad que tales principios tambien determinaron la organizacion de los mayas cldsicos. El tiempo, los calendarios y sobre todo los movimientos del sol vinieron ser vistos como "controlados " por los reyes sagrados mayas, respaldados por su equipo de sacerdotes calendaricos. Este espantoso poder cosmo-politico con tribuyo a la identificacion del rey con el sol y su legitimacion por el control de los medios de reproduccion social y cosmico. What was the power base of Classic period (ca. A.D. 200-900) lowland Maya "divine" kings? Some assert that it was economic (agricultural production, trade, water resource management); others declare that it resided in skills in warfare, relations with ances tors, impersonation of deities, or various other phe nomena. I argue that the foundation of Maya kings' power and divinity was esoteric knowledge about time or, better said, Time. This is not a new idea. Maya kings have been called "rulers of time" (Miller 1986) and "embodiments of time and its passage" (Stuart 1996:165), whose "dynasties owed their mandates to the control of time" (Edmonson 1988:196). But because these metaphors have not been fully scrutinized or deployed analytically, they are little more than tit illating tropes. Until very recently, time was not problematized or theorized by Americanist archaeologists, who continued to view time primarily in the context of periodization and chronology (cf. Leone 1978). This contrasted with the theorizing of time by Euro peanists and especially British archaeologists (e.g., Bailey 1983; Bourdieu 1977:8-9; Bradley 1991; Giddens 1981; Gosden and Lock 1998; Hodder 1993; Lucas 2005; Shanks andTilley 1987; van der LeeuwandMcGlade 1997; Williams 1998).

In other disciplines?including anthropol ogy (e.g., Gingrich et al. 2002), sociology, history, psychology, philosophy, etc.?time has been inves tigated in terms of its cognition (time conscious ness), politicization (including relations to capitalism), measurement (development of clocks), social memory, and so on (for historical overviews, see Aveni 2002; Bailey 1983; Chazan 1995; Waugh 1999; Whitrow 1988). Scholars in these fields, par ticularly the "sociology of time," enjoy the advan tage of consulting historical writings or living informants about time's meaning in a given society. For ancient societies like the Classic Maya, such direct inquiry is not possible. With few exceptions (e.g., Cohodas 1985:66; Houston et al. 2006:81-89; Miller 1986), scholars have evinced scant theoret ical interest in time and its manipulation by the ancient Maya. This is striking, because archaeolo gists increasingly have depended on the Mayas' own historical writings, dated by their complex cal endars, to reconstruct their histories. Mayanist archaeologists today address time primarily as it is revealed in dynastic and architectural succession, having long ago distanced themselves from the effusive excesses of early studies of "that sym phony of time which is the Maya calendar" by J. Eric S. Thompson (1960:1), Sylvanus G. Morley, Herbert J. Spinden, and others. Consequently, we rarely comprehend more about the meaning of time in Classic lowland Maya culture beyond the anchor ing of key events in rulers' lives and their domains through time's passage in multiple calendars. What was it about time that inspired the Maya to labori ously carve limestone monuments with 15 or more glyphs in order to temporally situate royal events? My answer is that, for the Maya, time not only represented cosmic order (Farriss 1987:574), it pro vided cosmic sanction for social order and politi cal power. Here I move beyond generalized assertions about time and Maya rulership based on iconography and epigraphy to support this position by, first, establishing cross-cultural and cross disciplinary contexts for the relations between time and power, and then by reviewing aspects of Clas sic Maya rulership and political organization in relation to later Postclassic, Colonial, and ethno graphically known descendants. I argue that a care fully crafted illusion of "control" of time constituted the armature of an ideology of the sacred king as an embodiment of the sun, and that powerful and precise calendars and time itself were politico ritually deployed and manipulated as instruments of power by the ruling dynasties. Time and Its Analysis "Most people relate to time much as a fish relates to water?uncritically swimming through it," com ments Michael Kearney (1984:98). Time is diffi cult to define succinctly; on www.dictionary.com, time as a noun has 20 listings. These, of course, are its English definitions; other languages may lack terms equivalent to our word "time." Scholars have construed time in various binary oppositions: nat ural versus social, linear versus cyclical, sacred/pro fane (Eliade 1987), ecological/structural (Evans-Pritchard 1940), abstract/substantial (Shanks and Tilley 1987:128), ideational/sensate (Sorokin 1962), subjective/objective (Hall 1980), reversible/irreversible, durational/non-durational, and soon.1 Time's conceptualization as a subject of acad emic study is typically attributed (e.g., Bloch 1977; Gell 1996:3-14; Munn 1992) to Emile Durkheim's The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915:10-11), in which he asserts that "We cannot conceive of time except by distinguishing its dif ferent moments" which "are taken from social life. The divisions into days, weeks, months, years, etc. correspond to the periodical recurrence of feasts and public ceremonies." Two salient elements for Durkheim and his many intellectual descendants, sociologists as well as anthropologists (e.g., Evans Pritchard 1940; Gell 1996; Leach 1961; Levi Strauss 1966; Zerubavel 1982a), are that time is a social construct?an artifact?and that time becomes socially "real" in relation to recurrent rit ual activities. Time Duration and Time-Reckoning: Cross Cultural and Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives "Duration" is closely related to time, although they are not synonymous (Howe 1981:223). Dictionar ies define duration in terms of something's exis tence, continuance, or persistence through time, often with some sense of boundedness (e.g., the duration of a game or a performance). Perhaps first introduced into scholarly studies of time by</page><page sequence="3">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 277 Durkheim (1915:441), duration can be conceptu alized as the subjective consciousness of the flow of time, thereby opposed to social or objective (and formally partitioned) time (cf. Sorokin and Merton 1937:619). Duration also lies at the core of what is sometimes dubbed "linear" time: the perception of continuity or "on-goingness" gives time its direc tional flow (Bloch 1977:282). Thus, extended dura tions are often measured in nonliterate societies by generations ("generational time"; Dietler and Her bich 1993:252-253), age-grades or life-cycle stages (Evans-Pritchard 1940), kingly reigns, or other "processes whose cycles are roughly coterminous with the human lifespan, or with stages in the devel opmental cycle of the domestic unit" (Gell 1996:17-18). As Leopold E. A. Howe (1981:231; emphasis added) explains, "[D]uration, the succession of events, is something the members of all societies experience although they represent it differently!' In other words, although we cannot study time consciousness and duration directly among ancient individuals or societies, we can examine how time is represented: how time's passage is reckoned, "how the intervals are obtained, the systems by which such units are counted,... how the units are conceptualised and what images and metaphors are employed" (Howe 1981:222; also Durkheim 1915:10). This operationalist perspective provides a convenient avenue for exploring concepts of time and their relation to power among the ancient Maya. "Time-reckoning" is a critical component. It refers to various ways of "telling" time by coordi nating an event with particular reference points (Munn 1992:102-103), which may be based on astronomical, meteorological, or cultural phenom ena (Malinowski 1927:204). Early time-reckoning was probably grounded in various natural processes?"the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies, i.e. the sun, the moon, and the most impor tant of the fixed stars,... the phases of the climate and the life of animals and plants" (Nilsson 1920:3)?but these are always culturally inter preted. Time-reckoning may be discontinuous, based on "time indications," or continuous, based on a calendar. Time indications were likely the earliest and simplest references to time in deep antiquity (see Nilsson 1920:9; Pocock 1967:305-307). These ref erences are typically imprecise: whether pre dictable or unpredictable, they refer to an event(s) "of fluctuating and unequal duration" but person ally or culturally significant. Time indications con tinue in common use today, for example: when Dad gets (or got) home from work, when Susan gradu ates (or graduated) from college, the time to pick peaches or harvest soybeans, or high or low tide. Millennia ago, time-indications might have refer enced a feud or war, great blizzard, comet or eclipse, position of the Pleiades, pestilence or epidemic, vol canic eruption, catastrophic flood, and so on: events that persist in social memory. Continuous time-reckoning depends on clocks and calendars, which calibrate time into equal inter vals. A calendar is a cognitive tool,2 a device or sys tem for reckoning time, consisting of a hierarchy of standard and equal sequential units (in Western systems: days, weeks, months; or seconds, minutes, and hours, in the case of clocks) that are tallied and accumulated into the next larger unit. Calendars are particularly associated with calibrating the year: its beginning and ending, its divisions, and its accu mulation into larger units (decades, centuries, and millennia, in Western calendars). They are based on or correlated with easily observable and recur rent natural?especially astronomical?events (e.g., cycles of the sun or moon). Calendars provide a fundamental element of social life: a "standard temporal reference frame work" shared throughout society (Zerubavel 1977:868), which integrates a society's concepts of time indication, duration, and reckoning into for mal calendrical systems. These systems, by exten sion, can "be regarded as products of the interaction between mathematical divisions of time and sym bolic frameworks of meaning" unique to the soci ety (Zerubavel 1977:872). Calendars therefore reinforce the notion that time is fundamentally a cultural construct and continuous time-reckoning is explicitly social: "it is only through interaction with others that I am subject to time. ... activities are not meaningful in terms of time except insofar as other people are concerned" (Pocock 1967:306). It follows, then, given the rich and deep-seated sociocultural basis of time concepts, that the tem poral framework(s) manifest in a group's calendar constitutes a basic component of their worldview (Kearney 1984:94-106) and identity, and can be manipulated politically to buttress a sense of "us" versus "them." Examples of such manipulation in</page><page sequence="4">278 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 the Western world can be seen in the temporal and ideological separation of early Christian Easter from related Jewish Passover holidays (Zerubavel 1982b) and the establishment of the short-lived French Revolutionary calendar to replace its pre decessor (Zerubavel 1977). Time, Social Organization, and Politico-economic Power In analyzing the relations between time and power among the Maya, I consider time to be part of their politico-religious ideology. Ideology may be defined as "a set of interrelated ideas that provides the members of a group with a rationale for their existence" (Conrad and Demarest 1984:4), in the sense of legitimizing an existing social order by explaining its power relations (see Godelier 1978:766; Knapp 1988:137; Santos Granero 1986:660). It can also be considered, in a more strictly Marxist sense, to represent the imagined relationships or assumptions about those relation ships between individuals and the realities of exis tence, and the "real" relations of production (Leone 1978:26-27). An ideology based on time and its reckoning is, I argue, an important means of accu mulating and exercising power and would have played a critical role in early (pre-Formative) soci eties. For example, it is widely agreed that a society's temporal reference network is closely related to its mode of production (Bourdillon 1978:595; Evans Pritchard 1940; Gell 1996:85, 89; Maxwell 1971:51; Smith 1996) and its level of complexity. Small hunter-gatherer bands have comparatively few social structural features (e.g., leadership or sta tus roles) and little requirement for precise obser vations of time to organize their activities. For them, time "has little economic value" (Movahedi 1985:388). Time indications are basically local and discontinuous, with little durational or widespread geographical impact. Systems of continuous time-reckoning, on the other hand, can be seen to arise out of socioeco nomic needs. They are associated generally with more complex economic endeavors such as horti culture: "any somewhat complicated work which has to be distributed over a prolonged period of time, and in which a number of people have to cooperate" (Malinowski 1927:203; also Sorokin and Merton 1937). In sedentary, horticulturally based, rank societies, time tends to be conceived in terms of the weather and activities associated with the economic round of the agricultural cycle (e.g., Malinowski 1927:209), and temporal con cepts are commonly task-oriented within the sub sistence round. Calendrical feasts "represent the agrarian year in ideal form as regular, repetitive and presided over by more or less reliable and benefi cent gods, who must be thanked and propitiated" (Gell 1996:91). For example, the Muria Gonds in southern India (Gell 1996:88-92) are largely illit erate but possess an elaborate ritual calendar ori ented around first-fruits ceremonies, "life-crisis" ceremonies (naming, marriage, etc.), feasts, pro cessions of deities, and so on. Thus the Muria "rit ualize time in cyclical form" (Gell 1996:90). How do "socioeconomic needs" and power relations intersect in such societies? Time, power,3 author ity, and agricultural scheduling are all linked within "the nature of the established regime of peasant pro duction. ... Exercising 'power' in the peasant milieu is equivalent to having control over time, being able ... to organize (i.e., schedule) the activities of a productive household" (Gell 1996:89). Extending the Marxist concern with control of the means of production, Maurice Godelier pro poses specialization in services as one factor con tributing to the development of internal social differentiation. In such cases, "the services ren dered by the dominant individuals or group must have involved... invisible realities and forces con trolling (in the thought of these societies) the repro duction of the universe and of life" (Godelier 1978:767; emphasis added).4They involved an ide ology, in other words. As an example, certain shamans among the Piaroa in Venezuela's Orinoco basin accrue political power from the belief that they possess "'mystical means of reproduction'? the mystical knowledge and ritual operations which are thought, symbolically and literally, to ensure the well-being and reproduction of both the social group and the natural environment" as well as the cosmos (Santos Granero 1986:658,659). It is easy to envision time-keeping?the "service" rendered to a larger group of predicting the coming of the rains or the rise of the new moon?as falling into this category. Continuous time-reckoning within a formal cal endrical system is a matter of political economy in relatively complex societies: production under con</page><page sequence="5">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 279 ditions of asymmetrical power between the pro ducers and those for whom they labor. Large, com plex agricultural societies have multiple social structural segments, roles, ranks or statuses, and relationships, all of which need to be coordinated to ensure efficient functioning and productivity. Typically such coordination is effectuated through a hierarchy of roles and functions manifest simul taneously in social, economic, and political spheres. Hierarchically oriented, stratified societies thus construct more complex representations and ide ologies of time (Bloch 1977; Gell 1996:80-81), many manifest in its actual or illusory "control" through various material representations, including clocks and calendars. Nancy Munn (1992:109) observes that "[C]ontrol over time is not just a strat egy of interaction; it is also a medium of hierarchic power and governance." That is, those who hold authority over the calendar of daily and seasonal economic and ritual activities of the society also hold authority over individuals' daily lives. This control extends farther, merging the daily and indi vidual with the annual and social, leading ulti mately "to a more comprehensive universe that entails critical values and potencies in which gov ernance is grounded. Controlling these temporal media variously implies control over this more comprehensive order and its definition, as well as over the capacity to mediate this wider order into the fundamental social being" (Munn 1992:109). More explicitly, for those at the top of the socio politico-economic hierarchy, time is power. As Ross Hassig (2001:71; emphasis added) com mented in his study of Aztec calendars, a formal calendar is a means of imposing social control, whether religious or political.... Its maintainers are reli gious or statal, and it is they who are its pri mary beneficiaries.... In short, the calendar does not generate a temporal structure that pat terns events, nor is it simply a temporal back drop against which political events can be set; rather, political concerns create the calendar, manipulate it, and use it for practical pur poses. The calendar has been one of the most effective instruments for exercising power in human society. In complex, hierarchical societies,5 the past (or pasts) may be accorded considerable salience in determining courses of action by providing social charters: "collectively held, publicly expressed and ideologically charged versions of the past, which are likely to vary within the groups that form a society" (Appadurai 1981:202). In many societies the ancestors confer supreme authority on the past. In others, the landscape, particularly the built envi ronment, animates time, social memory, and iden tity (Bender 2002; Gosden and Lock 1998; Umberger 1987; Williams 1998). Within this land scape, ancient temples or monuments?themselves displaying celestial orientations or hierophanies? may be the focus of ceremonial processions or pil grimages.6 In such public settings, it is typically the role of rituals, regularly scheduled according to the rhythms of a calendar, to recall the past and cele brate the continuities between past and present. Linear and Cyclical Time Some authors (e.g., Bloch 1977:282) assert that there are only two notions of time: linear and cycli cal. Others (e.g., Howe 1981:231) disagree, sug gesting that time is not either cyclical or linear; rather, a society may possess both types but each operates in different domains. Maya historian Nancy Farriss (1987:572) argues that one of the two must be subordinated to or incorporated into the other. Linear time is generally considered "durational time," but also sometimes historical, irreversible, secular, or profane time. It is envisioned as a con tinuous, unidirectional, chronological line or flow from past to present to future. It is time as widely experienced from day-to-day and year-to-year, and in the modern world it is registered by clocks and calendars. Cyclical time, for those who do not formally observe it, can be difficult to conceptualize. How ever, most phenomena of the natural world used for time indications and the passage of so-called lin ear time are recurring or cyclical, such as the sea sons and the phases of the moon. Agriculture is also cyclical in its rhythms of planting, weeding, har vesting, and planting anew. Cycles may be defined as intervals in which events repeat in roughly the same order or as periodically recurring sequences of events. This has led to the conceptualization of cyclical time as "oscillating" (Kearney 1984:98-99) or "zig-zagging" time, a "repetition of repeated reversal" between polar opposites in</page><page sequence="6">280 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 which "all past is equally past; it is simply the oppo site of now" (Leach 1961:126). These notions are misleading and a better image of cyclical time is an extensile coil rather than a closed circle: a spi ral (Hassig 2001:3) or a Slinky toy (Farriss 1987:572). Within a cycle, time proceeds linearly and successive cycles do not begin at the same tem poral points; instead, they begin at the same logi cal point (Howe 1981:231). Cyclical time is usually contrasted with linear time?as non-durational and ahistorical?but it is also agreed to be particularly associated with rit ual expression and the sacred. According to Mircea Eliade (1987:68; emphasis in original), sacred time structures rituals and festivals and is "reversible" because it is "a primordial mythical time made pre sent." That is, rituals always take the participants back to the same point in the mythical past, which may be the beginning of time or "beyond time" in a strictly chronological sense (Eliade 1987:69-72). They summon sacred history, a time of the gods and the ancestors and an era of mythic heroes, and they re-enact the creation and re-creation of the cosmos. Cyclical time is a "'succession of eterni ties,' periodically recoverable during the festivals that made up the sacred calendar" (Eliade 1987:104). Time-Reckoning in Early Mesoamerican Prehistory "For the Maya and the rest of Mesoamerica, time is cosmic order, its cyclical patterning the coun terforce to the randomness of evil," writes Nancy Farriss (1987:574). How and when did such a pow erful ideology develop and endure for several thou sand years? I contend that it developed early in the prehistory of the area?Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize?that was later to become Mesoamerica (Rice 2007). The "Archaic" stage (ca. 7000-1500 B.C.) in Mesoamerica was a protracted interval in which complex processes transformed mobile, acephalous, hunting-gathering-fishing societies into sedentary villages and chiefdoms. Archaeolo gists have reconstructed this transition in arid high land environments in temporal terms?the "seasonality" and "scheduling" of subsistence activities?accompanied by settlement shifts between small microbands and larger macrobands (Flannery 1966; MacNeish 1972). During the dry "winter" season, small groups moved into various niches to forage for scarce foodstuffs; with the com ing of the rains these microbands gathered in areas of plentiful food. Similar settlement shifts based on seasonal subsistence activities are known ethno graphically (Maxwell 1971:65-67) as well as archaeologically in other types of environments, revealing that such patterns are not unique to high land Mexico. The periods of settlement aggrega tion (macrobands) in late summer and fall apparently were gradually extended as tended plant foods came to be domesticated, yielding storable surpluses. Eventually these large encampments became permanent, year-round-occupied hamlets and villages. Analogies with hunter-gatherer groups such as the Shoshone in the Southwestern United States suggest that seasonal settlement aggregations were occasions for rituals, dances, feasting, "marriage," commemorations of ancestors, gaming, and so on. When such festivals are planned, preparations must be accommodated within regular activities and summoning people from distant locale requires that a future date must be clearly specified (Malinowski 1927:203). Thus, scheduling festivities would necessitate attention to environmental time indications, perhaps the ripening of certain plants like maize or the length of a person's shadow, or solar events such as the late summer zenith (sun directly overhead) or later fall equinox. Whatever the mechanism, "festivals and time-reckoning are from the beginning inseparably bound" (Nilsson 1920:336). The increasing size and permanence of settle ments resulted in larger, denser horticulturally based communities with more roles and relation ships, including divisions of labor. Insights into the role of time among Early and Middle Formative/ Preclassic-period (ca. 2000- 400 B.C.) tribal and chiefdom-level societies in Mesoamerica are sug gested by ethnographic accounts. For example, hor ticultural societies tend to reckon time meteorologically, on the basis of seasons and the cycle of planting, weeding, and harvesting. Ritu als are scheduled in accordance with this cycle and typically consist of propitiatory activities toward the supernaturals associated with the rains and the crops. Of particular interest in the relations between</page><page sequence="7">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 281 time and power is the process by which individu als or groups came to be identified with time and its manipulation and "control." It is not difficult to envision that such individuals emerged in the way Godelier (1978:767; also Sahlins 1968:12) described, having accumulated sufficient special ized knowledge to "monopolize the means ... of reproduction of the universe." An individual or group came to serve as a "specialist"?perhaps a shaman or priest?as the scheduling of camp move ments or crop duties came to have ever greater salience in socioeconomic life. An example (albeit one not concerned with time), concerns Piaroa spe cialized shamans, who own the "mystical means of reproduction": special ritual knowledge that con fers political power (Santos Granero 1986). A time related example comes from the Kenyan of Borneo, where a man in every village has the sole respon sibility to determine the time for sowing. He accom plishes this by observing the length of the sun's shadow every midday using a special tool: a notched pole as a gnomon. One notch marks the shadow's maximum length, the next its length three days after it has begun to shorten, and so on. His specialized time-reckoning service is recompensed, as he "need not cultivate rice himself, for he will receive his supplies from the other inhabitants of the village" (Nilsson 1920:318). Farmers, of course, do not literally need calen dar priests to inform them when to plant and when to harvest. This they capably ascertain from their own observations of seasonal cycles, weather, and accumulated experience. What farmers do need, however, is supernatural blessing on their enter prise, translated through human agency?that is, priestly authority?as to the most favorable day or days to carry out such activities and related rituals. In sum, major decisions about social and eco nomic affairs can be based on observations of nat ural phenomena, such as the sun's position in the sky or on the horizon, and the responsibility for making these observations can be held by a single individual or a group of individuals socially assigned such duties. These individuals may have special titles (sun priest; daykeeper) and may be full-time specialists who do not produce their own sustenance. Also, they may utilize specialized devices, not available to others, for precise astro nomical measurements (see Smith 1996). Shamans of various sorts, whether or not daykeepers, con trol power objects used in curing rituals or other ceremonies: the Piaroa specialist, for example, wears "beads of knowledge" on his chest, legs, and wrists (Santos Granero 1986:663). Tools for time reckoning (or similarly specialized activities) are instruments of power, manipulable by their own ers for political, economic, social, or ideological ends. It is not clear, however, if prehistoric Mesoamer icans charged with observing the sky employed specialized instruments. Sticks, poles, or other tools of perishable materials?such as the wooden "cal endar board" in twentieth-century Chamula, Mex ico (Gossen 1974a) or a crossed-trapezes device (Digby 1974; associated with Teotihuacan head dresses but also worn by Xiuhtecuhtli, the central Mexican god of fire and time; Solfs 2004:28; Rice 2007:50-51)?are unlikely to have survived the millennia until archaeological recovery. Concave, ground, iron-ore mirrors in early Isthmian Mesoamerica, depicted as head or pectoral orna ments (Carlson 1981; Heizer and Gullberg 1981), might have been somehow used in capturing the sun's rays or as equivalents to "beads of knowl edge." As exotic prestige goods symbolizing wealth and power, these mirrors can be considered "not mere representations but actual encapsulations or embodiments of cosmological power... [which can either] enhance social order within or energize the expansion of social-political order outward" (Helms 1993:215). Time and the Maya The foregoing cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary perspectives on time drawn from sociology, anthro pology, and history can be applied to the lowland Maya civilization to show how they illuminate rela tions of power during the Classic period. This dis cussion focuses on "state views" of time, in which time and calendars were tools of Maya elites in the creation of "heroic histories," because what was recorded on surviving public monuments concerns events in the lives of rulers and their kingdoms. In the absence of time representations in domestic, non-elite contexts, it is difficult to know how ordi nary Maya might have viewed time. Commoners were probably illiterate in terms of hieroglyphic texts (see Brown 1991; Houston and Stuart 1992), relying, in the case of calendrics and divinatory</page><page sequence="8">282 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 knowledge, on local priests or daykeepers for guid ance about such esoterica. Farmers likely were pri marily concerned with deities of nature and the agricultural cycle (Cohodas 1985:66), maintaining the kinds of time orientations associated with non hierarchically organized horticultural societies the world over. Time was expressed primarily from a male point of view, as Maya sculptors and callig raphers and most (but not all) rulers were male (see Houston et al. 2006:52), and, despite great interest in gender roles among the Maya, there has been lit tle attention to time and gender (cf. Tedlock 1992a, 2005). Classic Maya Calendars The Maya promulgated elite histories in hiero glyphic texts inscribed on freestanding stelae and architectural slabs, and on carved or painted portable objects such as jade ornaments and pot tery. A salient element of these records was the dat ing of the occurrences portrayed and/or described textually, typically key events in the lives of rulers of individual sites. These affairs were dated by their positions in two concurrently running calendars,7 one of 365 days and one of 260 days, frequently (though not always) augmented by reference to their occurrence in lunar cycles. The 260-day calendar, which archaeolo gists call the tzolk 'in ('count of days') and assumed to be the older of the two, consists of a sequence of 20 day names preceded by the numerals 1 through 13. The 365-day calendar (ja'ab') com prises 18 "months" of 20 days numbered from 0 through 19 for a total of 360, plus an additional five "unlucky" days to more closely approximate the solar year (actually 365.2422 days). Each day was identified by both number and name in the 260-day calendar and number and "month" name in the 365-day calendar, as, for example, 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk'u. Only four days of the tzolk'in could begin the annual cycle and these are anthropomorphized as "yearbearers": deities bearing the burden of time on their backs for a year-long journey. Any partic ular day named and numbered in both calendars (such as a day 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk'u) recurred every 18,980 days (365 x 260), an interval of 52 years known as the Calendar Round. Both calendars were widespread throughout Mesoamerica (see Edmonson 1988) from ancient times through the twentieth century. They are typ ically modeled by scholars as two cogged wheels of different circumferences (i.e., numbers of days, 260 vs. 365), turning together (Figure 1; but note that the Maya did not possess pivoted wheel tech nology). These calendars represent observation and measurement of so-called cyclical time, and the names of the months and days?known from Clas sic inscriptions and ethnographic investigation? are largely drawn from natural phenomena, including plants, animals, and weather. Each day had favorable or unfavorable auguries, deter minable only by trained specialists, for various activities depending on the confluence of cosmic forces governing their destinies. Because of these portents, the Calendar Round emphasized qualita tive aspects of time (Miller 1986:24). Besides recognizing cyclical and qualitative time, the Classic Maya also recorded linear, dura tional, and quantitative time through the Initial Series or Long Count (Figure 2), which dated events by tallying the number of elapsed days since an arbitrary starting point of August 11,3114 B .C.8 In this system, days were counted in bundles, pri marily multiples of 20 days, arranged in vertical order in inscriptions: B'ak'tun = 144,000 days (20 k'atuns; -400 Gre gorian years) K'atun = 7,200 days (20 tuns; -20 years) Tun = 360 days (18 winals; ~ 1 year) Winal = 20 k'ins K'in = 1 day Thus an event was dated by the number of b'ak' tuns completed since this starting date, then the number of completed k'atuns, completed tuns or "years," completed winals or "months," and finally "leftover" days (k'ins). These units were followed by glyphs representing patrons of the Lords of the Night and information about lunations. All told, an Initial series date might include 15 or more glyphs marshaled to record the synchronization of the memorialized event in the many flows of Maya time.9 Texts often identify sequences of events, which may require specification of temporal intervals between, for example, the inauguration of a ruler and another event such as a war. These intervals are indicated in inscriptions by so-called distance numbers: the number of days to be counted back ward or forward from another given date. Distance numbers can be considered "the most purely dura</page><page sequence="9">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 283 *^ \ SK0 ? ? ? ? ? /V*. / Figure 1.

Other time-related glyphic collocations are known as anterior event indicators and posterior event indicators. The origins of the two main Mesoamerican cal endars are unknown, although they are commonly thought to have been created sometime in the first millennium B .C. Elsewhere I (Rice 2007) argue that these calendars originated a millennium or more earlier, given the importance of time-reckoning among peoples with a horticultural subsistence base, and the context of a seasonally alternating set tlement strategy.10 Although the 260-day and 365-day calendars</page><page sequence="10">284 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 A B 8 Sf^C s!3h Figure 2.

Their concern was clearly "about" something significantly above and beyond collective needs to determine times to plant and har vest, schedule a festival, or record a king's birth for posterity. Maya elites were acutely and reveren tially conscious of their own history and dedicated to situating it within cosmic eternity. Maya Creation Myths The centrality of calendars and temporal cycling among the Maya is evident in their creation sto ries.11 One well-known Maya myth of cosmogen esis is the Popol Vuh (Christenson 2003; Tedlock 1996), the creation myth of the K'iche' Maya in highland Guatemala, which was committed to writ ing in the Maya language, using the Latin alpha bet, in the mid sixteenth century (Tedlock 1996:56). It is likely, however, that this myth was brought to the K' iche' through contacts with the lowland Maya during the Postclassic period (Tedlock 1996:16, 46, 51, 21 ln30). The Popol Vuh, like origin myths in general, is a sacred history manifest as "part of the ceremonial calendar that mapped social rela tions in space and time" (Gillespie 1989:209). I believe that the Popol Vuh was structured by time and constitutes an allegory encoding the major developments of the Mesoamerican and Maya cal endars (Rice 2007). A key element is that the gods fashioned multiple creatures who were expected to praise them and give them offerings "according to the rhythms of a calendar" (Tedlock 1996:32). The earliest of these?pre-humans made of mud and wood, who could not speak intelligibly or keep the days of a calendar?were destroyed. The current era, dominated by humans who keep calendars and praise the gods, was born with the rising of the sun over the primordial darkness. In Godelier's (1978:767) terms, keeping the days according to a calendar exemplifies the importance of specializa tion in services relating to "forces controlling . .. the reproduction of the universe and of life." Early foundational stories in this myth's antecedents were probably public performances, eventually staged alongside narrative scenes carved on stelae in the plazas of major ceremonial centers such as Izapa in the Late Preclassic period (Guernsey Kappelman 2001; Laughton 1997; Rice</page><page sequence="11">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 285 2007). Such performances reinforced social and cosmic order through the telling and retelling of the history of the world and its creatures, and of the origins of time itself. Thus the Popol Vuh was a sacred charter underwriting cosmic order. Unlike Preclassic Izapa and its monuments, the Classic Maya made few public references to the creatures and events in the Popol Vuh, including the adventures of the Hero Twins. Instead, such refer ences are largely confined to scenes on painted pot tery, most unprovenienced but thought to originate in tombs (Coe 1978). Other creation stories, which appear only rarely in public contexts, such as on carved monuments, mention the setting of stones and could reference calendrical creation. These stones, whether real or metaphorical, originally might have been gnomons used to aid observation. A hint comes from Yukatekan near-homophones tun and tuun, which mean "year" (of 360 days) and "stone," respectively. These related senses may stretch back to the middle Late Preclassic period (Justeson and Mathews 1983:587), reinforcing a connection between stones and calendrical com memorations12 that dates well before the beginning of the Common Era. Classic Representations of Time Because societies experience and represent time and duration differently, time's role can begin to be understood through an examination of the ways in which it is subdivided and what constructs, images, and metaphors are used to represent time, its units, and their duration (Howe 1981:231; Leach 1961:135). Such representations convey a good deal about a society's attitudes toward time and its value. For example, time can be an arrow or a river or sand; in North America, the new year is anthro pomorphized as an infant who ages into decrepit Father Time 365 days later. Time has been corn modified and can be spent, wasted, or killed; "time is money," to quote Ben Franklin. Here I examine Maya representations of a time-based ideology: their concepts, beliefs, and values as materialized in physical form in art, artifacts, monuments, archi tecture, ritual, and performance (see DeMarrais et al.; Santos Granero 1986:660). The most distinctive characteristic of Classic Maya representations of time is that temporal units were animate. Moreover, all units?days, bundles of days, and even the numbers by which they were counted?were presented in three ways: symbolic (geometric), head variant ("personified"), and full figure. Numbers, in simplest, symbolic form, are depicted in a bar-dot system, in which a dot (a fin gerprint?) stands for 1 and a bar (thumb? hand held flat?) stands for 5; a shell-like symbol stands for 0. Positional notation was used to denote ever larger counts (e.g., tuns, k'atuns, b'ak'tuns). Numbers also could be represented by head variants: the heads of the gods of those numbers, either anthro pomorphic or zoomorphic. Temporal units or bundles may be shown as symbolic, head-variant (Figure 3), and full-figure (Figure 4) signs. Sometimes these seem related? for example, the symbolic form might appear as an infix in a personified head glyph?but in other cases the relationship is difficult to discern. Head-variant glyphs typically are animal heads, while the rarely seen full-figure glyphs depict anthropomorphic deities of the numbers plus a zoomorphic creature for the temporal unit. In these full-figure glyphs, almost exclusively from the southeastern sites of Copan (Honduras) and Quirigua (Guatemala), the anthropomorphic deities of the numbers are shown interacting with full-figure zoomorphic represen tations of the temporal units, sometimes bearing them on their backs by a tumpline and other times seeming to wrestle with them. K'in. The word k 'in means day, sun, or time. The symbolic form is a quadripartite glyph represent ing a four-petaled flower (Figure 3e, left; Macri and Looper 2003:36, 197), but is usually taken as one of several Maya symbols meaning "completion" or "whole" in the sense of the four cardinal directions (Coggins 1980). The most common head variant of the k 'in glyph is the head of the sun god, char acterized by a squarish eye, a looped cruller-like ornament above a Roman nose, and tow-shaped incisors (Figure 3e, right; see Thompson 1960:142, Figure 27.58-66). Other head variants are monkey like creatures and the full-figure glyph for the k'in is either a human (sun god?) or a monkey (Thomp son 1960:43, Figure 29.5-10). Winal. The winal of 20 days appears to be related to the moon, but the symbolic glyph representing this period is difficult to read (Figure 3d, left; see Thompson 1960:143, Figure 26.41-48). Head variant and full-figure representations of the winal are signified by the head and full body, respec</page><page sequence="12">286 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 Figure 3.

Some rep resentations suggest a Bufo marinus toad, indicated by apparent parotoid glands on the shoulders (Fig ure 3d, right). Tun. The Maya tun refers to a period of 360 days (a "year") as well as a slit drum, held horizontally in play. Its symbolic glyphic referent is a drum (Macri and Looper 2003:190): a cartouche with two vertical black bands in the upper half and a circle in the lower half (Figure 3c, left). The same glyphic sign may refer to the 360-day year as well as to the 365-day one (ja'ab'). Zoomorphic versions show a composite creature?a supernatural bird?with an elongated beak or snout, bony mandible, and sometimes a tun grapheme in the headdress (Fig ures 3c, right, 4c; Macri and Looper 2003:36, 153-154). Thompson (1960:145) believes the head tufts signify the ear tufts of a screech owl, and thus the avian is the Muwan Bird of Classic iconogra phy, sometimes identified with rain. Full-figure glyphs may depict a peculiar creature that Thomp son identifies as a crab and at least one shows an avian; as in the head variant, the tun sign may appear as a headdress (Figure 4c; Thompson 1960:145, Figure 28.12-17). K'atun. The word k'atun is often thought to derive from k'al tun, meaning 20 tuns or years (Thompson 1960:145-146), but more recent read ings suggest that it was k'altuun 'closing stone, stone-binding' (Houston et al. 2006:81-82). The glyphic form is a tun sign with a superfix consist ing of a day-sign, Kawak, flanked by comb-like ele ments meaning "count" (Figure 3b, right; Thompson 1960:146, Figure 26.24-32). The head variant depicts the head of a bird (Figure 3b, left) (Macri and Looper 2003:153), sometimes with the kawak-comb superfix as a headdress and a human</page><page sequence="14">288 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 like hand at the jaw,13 while the full-figure variant is a raptor (Figure 4b; Thompson 1960:146, Fig ures 27.15-27, 28.6-11). B 'ak'tun. The period of 400 tuns (or 20 k'atuns), which archaeologists refer to as a b'ak'tun, might have been known as pij or pik by the Maya. The glyphic sign consists of a pair of kawak glyphs as in the k'atun sign (Figure 3a, right; Macri and Looper 2003:36; Thompson 1960:Figure 26.15-23), while the head variant resembles that of the k 'atun: a raptor head with, almost invariably, a hand at or in place of the mandible (Figure 3a, left; Macri and Looper 2003:152; Thompson 1960:Figure 27.3-14). The full-figure glyph also shows this avian (Figure 4a; Thompson 1960:Fig ure 28.1-5). Representations of time, and the locations of such representations, changed over the course of the Maya civilization. In the Late Preclassic, the sun (god) and other supernaturals were depicted via giant, painted stucco masks on the facades of tem ple superstructures. At the site of Cerros, in north ern Belize, for example, the masks on the lower terrace feature the rising sun god (identified by k 'in glyphs) on the east and the setting sun on the west. Those on the terrace just above feature Venus as morning star on the east heralding the rising sun and Venus as evening star on the west (Scheie and Freidel 1990:105-116). The ruler, ascending the stairs to the summit between these sets of masks, appears to observers to be surrounded by and at the pivot of the forces of the cosmos. Similar masks were constructed in the Early Classic at Tikal (Miller 1986:37-^5) and elsewhere. By the Late Classic period, however, such bold architectonic statements about the ruler and solar cycling had dis appeared, accompanied by a "shift of emphasis to time's lineal (quantitative) characteristic" (Miller 1986:29). Moreover, during the Late Classic the Maya began to cease carving the Long Count on public monuments and adopted abbreviated systems of recording time. First came the practice of carving only the day coordinates of the two calendars, as, for example, 13 Ajaw 18 Kumk'u. By the Post classic period, this was further reduced to the "Short Count" or count of the k 'atuns (u k 'ahlay k 'atunob), in which events were dated solely by the ending day (in the 260-day calendar) of the k 'atun in which they occurred, as K'atun 17 Ajaw. Apparently, the need to register dynastic accomplishments by spe cific days in linear time diminished and general cycles?k'atuns?were accorded greater impor tance in recording long-term histories. This, of course, has caused scholars considerable difficul ties in dating events, because the same k'atun name recurs every -256 years. In addition to the abundant Classic images, a few representations of time from the Postclassic and later periods also suggest that the "shape of time" changed from linear to circular and cyclical. At Late Postclassic (A.D. 1200-1450) Mayapan in northern Yucatan, a carved stone turtle displayed 13 partitions around the edge of the carapace, each with an ajaw glyph (Taube 1988) indicating the 13 ajaw-based k'atuns of another cycle known as the may (see below). Various Colonial-period illustra tions of this cycle (Edmonson 1986:114; Taube 1988:185; Tozzer 1966:167) also show it as a cir cle with anthropomorphic faces (ajaw glyph, 'lord') in the 13 partitions. One variant, the "coat of arms" of the Xiw lineage in northern Yucatan, shows 13 human heads arranged as in a k'atun wheel, under scoring "the importance of temporal control as a definitive marker of function for ancestral elites" (Cortez 2002:212). Linguistic and Later Ethnographic and Ethnohistoric Perspectives Grammar, particularly verbal constructions, reveals Maya views of time. Maya verbs focus on aspect rather than on tense as in English and Spanish. Tense is linear and oriented to the present?the past tense means "before now"?while aspect "is focused on other ways of conceiving events, such as their completion, duration, repetition, or sud denness. The most basic distinction is completive vs. durative (progressive, continuous)" (C. A. Hofling, personal communication 2006; see also Wald 2004). This linguistic emphasis on aspect, then, structures the Maya emphasis on cyclical time. Additional information on how the Classic Maya conceptualized the structure of time can be drawn from the broader context of the social, eco nomic, and political world of the Postclassic-period (ca. A.D. 900-1525) and later Maya. In many cases, however, these concepts have been elicited from daykeeper/priest/shamans who were neither sculpt ing the heroic histories of yore nor employing the</page><page sequence="15">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 289 protean anthropo- and zoomorphic imagery of the Classic period. Although concepts of time and the calendar might have been altered by 500 years of Christianity and more than a millennium of "post Classic" history, most scholars concede great con tinuity (e.g., Earle 1986; Leon-Portilla 1988; Villa Rojas 1988). In Postclassic- and Colonial-period northern Yucatan, all political and religious officials were required to be trained as sun priests, aj k'in, which required noble birth (Edmonson 1982:25-26n426). The term k'in in the priestly title denotes their cal endrical responsibilities, perhaps analogous to those of modern highland daykeepers or time keepers. Ethnographically, the concept of k'in as "sun-day-time?was not an abstract entity but a reality enmeshed in the world of myths, a divine being, origin of the cycles which govern all exist ing things" (Leon-Portilla 1988:33). The sun's daily sweep of the sky and its nightly traverse of the Underworld back to the east are metaphors for time, space, and cosmic order in Mesoamerica (Earle 1986:156; Gossen 1974b; Graulich 1981; Leon Portilla 1988; Watanabe 1983). The extremes of the sun's annual track along the horizon between its solstitial rising and setting points not only prescribe spatial order (the cardinal and intercardinal direc tions), they also establish temporal order by bear ing the transitions of the seasons. These solar journeys, daily and annual, constitute the under pinnings of the cyclical concept of time in Mesoamerica, a concept that?with its spatial translations?endured through the twentieth cen tury in many areas, particularly in remote parts of the Maya highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, as fundamental components of worldview, ritual, and administrative life (Gossen and Leven thal 1993; B. Tedlock 1992a). Similarly, Maya calendars, particularly that of 260-days, continued to be maintained and used by trained practitioners (daykeepers) into the twenty first century, and calendars and time-related rituals have captured the interest of Mayanist historians and ethnohistorians (Bricker 1984, 1989; Edmon son 1988; Farriss 1987) as well as cultural anthro pologists (Gossen 1974b; B. Tedlock 1992a, 1992b). These studies provide direct historical analogies which, although plagued with pitfalls and criticisms (see Rice 2004:9-19), can be?when carefully used?a source of models or hypotheses to evaluate in the context of the Classic Maya. For example, traditional ritual specialists or diviners known as daykeepers in Momostenango, in west ern highland Guatemala, make observations of sun rise and sunset positions on the horizon every 20 days, in order to anticipate the solar zenith and lead the celebrations of the new year (B. Tedlock 1992a:33). They also interpret the positive and neg ative portents of the days in the 260-day calendar for any affairs carried out, and personalities and careers of children born, on any particular day.14 The indigenous books of the chilam b 'alams, which record prophecies of the spokesman (chilam) of the jaguar (b 'alam) priest in the northern Yucatan peninsula, constitute annales-type "prophetic his tories" summarizing events by k'atun periods. They may go back as far as the tenth century A.D., but were committed to writing in the Yukateko Mayan language using the Latin alphabet after the sixteenth-century conquest. Munro Edmonson (1982, 1986; see also Farriss 1987:577-578), in translating two of these books, elucidated a calen drically based geopolitical organizational model of the Late Postclassic Maya in northern Yucatan. According to this model, political organization was based on intervals of approximately 256 Gregorian years known as the may ('cycle'). This interval was actually 260 tuns (the 360-day "years") in duration, and the total of 260 tuns comprised 13 k'atuns (of 20 tuns each). For each period of 260 tuns (-256 Gregorian years), the Maya enshrined or "seated" the may or cycle in a particular city, and lesser cities and towns within its realm rotated in seating its 13 constituent k'atuns. The well-known archaeologi cal site of Mayapan, in northern Yucatan, was an important may seat in the Late Postclassic period. The seat of the may, a quintessential regal-ritual city (Fox 1977), was a sacred capital "Born of Heaven") that held "dynastic and religious primacy over the whole country" for 256 years, after which it was symbolically destroyed and abandoned (Edmonson 1982:xvi, 1986:4-5). Subsidiary k'atun seats exercised political authority for -20-year periods, receiving tribute and controlling land titles and political appoint ments (Edmonson 1982:xvi, 1986:4-5). Signifi cantly, the Yukateko word "k'atun" not only meant a period of 20 tuns, but also "war" and "soldier," supporting references to considerable levels of political competition to seat k'atuns.15</page><page sequence="16">290 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 Both cyclical and linear time were registered in indigenous and Spanish Colonial-period sources. Cyclical time is evident in post-conquest records of k'atun seats after ca. A.D. 1524. The ending of these temporal cycles and the simultaneous begin nings of the next, including the ending of the b 'ak' tun in 1618 (Edmonson 1985),16 were celebrated with grand public rituals, feasts, processions, and speeches, including activities traceable into the Classic period. Linear time-reckoning can be seen in indigenous claims of land ownership made to Colonial authorities, based on length of occupancy, and in autochthonous histories emphasizing genealogical succession. These latter "encode information about political power: who wields it, when, where, and, most especially, by what author ity" (Farriss 1987:576-577). Time and Classic Maya Rulership Social scientists who study the role of time in soci ety emphasize that time and its manipulation (i.e., the illusion of "control" over it) is a way of impos ing social order. Maintenance of social and cosmic order is the responsibility of ruling elites, whose legitimacy depends on the efficacious exercise of that duty as reflected in societal stability, prosper ity, and wealth. That is, time is the key foundation of elite authority and what Munn (1992:109) calls "cosmo-political power." In the case of the Maya, however, there is no agreement among archaeologists and epigraphers about the nature of Classic lowland Maya political organization, and a salient question concerns how such organization can be determined archaeologi cally. Proposals about Late Classic (A.D. 600-830) geopolitical organization have ranged from extremely centralized (two major "superstates;" Martin and Grube 1995) to extremely decentral ized: a myriad of petty kingdoms (for reviews, see Lucero 1999; Rice 2004:22-55). Increasing sup port for a hierarchy of not only cities but offices within cities has come from decipherment of var ious titles applied to rulers and other nobles, and these indicate that some are clearly secondary to higher office. Classic Maya kings are typically considered to have been divine or sacred. Their title or the title of their office, ajaw ('lord, king'; the same as the day name), is often prefaced by k'ul or k'ujul (in Yukatekan; Ch'olan ch'ul, ch'ujul), indicating 'holy/divine/sacred lord'. Sovereigns sometimes adopted the attire and symbols that would identify them as the mythological Hero Twin known as Hunahpu, who represents the new sun of the pre sent creation, and they were often given the epithet k'inich 'sun-faced'. Stuart (1996:167) refers to a "conceptual equation of the ruler and the sun." It has been argued that the institution of divine kingship began around 100 B.C. (Freidel and Scheie 1988). I propose, however, that the identi fication of rulers with the sun began centuries ear lier, perhaps by 500 B.C., as evidenced by site layouts emphasizing an east-west orientation, in contrast to the earlier north-south plans (Rice 2007; see also Clark and Hansen 2001). This is best exem plified by the plethora of constructions of so-called "E-Group" assemblages, paired structures com memorating sight lines to solstitial and equinoctial sunrises beginning in the Middle Preclassic period (Aimers and Rice 2006). Ethnohistoric and ethnographic analogies sug gest that the cycling of cosmic time provided a charter for Postclassic and post-conquest Maya political organization (Edmonson 1982,1986; Far riss 1987:577). This Malinowskian-Appaduraian charter was in existence far earlier in Mesoamer ica and time was even more significant to Classic lowland Maya rulers. Edmonson's (1982:xvi-xvii, 1986:4-5) may model, or a prototype geopolitical model of rotating capitals, can be retrodicted from the Late Postclassic period into the Classic and the Preclassic or Formative periods (Rice 2007). The most persuasive evidence for the may in the Late Classic period comes from carved, dated ste lae, often with round altars in front of them. Stelae were erected in various locations in Maya cities, typically in open plazas and often in front of the eastern structure in E-Groups commemorating solar cycling (Aimers and Rice 2006). Although some stelae lack carving, many were inscribed with now-decipherable texts. Some of these include Emblem Glyphs, which typically incorporate the prefix read as k'ul or k'ujul and may proclaim that not only the king but the city was regarded as holy (as in "heaven-born"). Stelae also were inscribed with dates, a substantial proportion of which record the celebration of completion of a major time period, or a subdivision of a period, in the Maya Long Count; these are particularly tun and k'atun</page><page sequence="17">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 291 endings, along with the latter's five-year subdivi sions (jotuns; Morley 1917). The Classic Maya noted time's passage by period-endings, presided over by a day Ajaw (Lord), rather than by their next day beginnings. The most important of these period-ending mon uments for the may model are the k'atun-mding stelae at Tikal, in northern Guatemala (Peten). There, as many as nine distinctive architectural assemblages known as twin-pyramid groups were created to celebrate k'atun endings, particularly between A.D. 692 and 790. These complexes fea ture four structures oriented to the cardinal direc tions, the eponymous eastern and western pyramids being isomorphic and the structure in the north, home of the ancestors, was an open enclosure for a stela-altar pair. Five groups have stelae dated to k'atun endings, and these depict a ruler in extrav agant garb performing a "scattering" ritual, inter preted as sprinkling drops of blood, kernels of corn, or divination crystals. Ambiguous figures, gener ally interpreted as ancestors, frequently are entwined in clouds or incense smoke wafting above the ruler's head. Only a few other sites in the vicin ity, probable k'atun seats within Tikal's may realm, constructed twin-pyramid complexes and shared these stelae's iconographic elements, suggesting that shared architectural programs may have been part of the affiliation between may and k 'atun seats (Rice 2004:121-126). The erection of k'atun-^nding stelae with ances tor figures is significant for the time-based may or related model of geopolitical organization in the Classic period, because one component of period ending ceremonies in Colonial times was the erec tion of a cross to commemorate the ancestors (Edmonson 1986:23). In addition, Bishop Landa reported that informants living around Mayapan erected large stones at that site every 20 years; coin cidentally, 13 carved stelae (one for every k'atun in a may!) have been found there (Tozzer 1966:38-39). In an idealized may model, a may seat would have 13 k'atun seats in its realm. Epigraphic evi dence for this possibility at Tikal comes from a hieroglyphic stairway at Dos Pilas, which men tions the site's victory in a conflict with Tikal, iden tifying the Tikal ruler as "he of thirteen provinces" (Boot 2002). Other hints of maj-based geopoliti cal organization include Altar 3 from Altar de Los Reyes, Campeche, displaying 13 Emblem Glyphs around its edge (Grube 2002), as in the Colonial Xiw coat of arms. Obviously, Classic kings sought to link "their models of political reality with the order of time itself (Houston et al. 2006:95). The parallels in geopolitical organization between the Classic Maya and the Late Postclas sic Maya of Mayapan are significant in several respects, but raise important questions. First, although the may might have operated in both con texts, in the Classic period the ruler was a divine king whereas Mayapan is thought to have been governed by multepal, an assembly of powerful lineages. Second, at Mayapan the Late Classic rit ual of erecting k'atun-ending monuments seems to have been reinstated, with stones raised every 20 years. However, there is little to no indication that similar period-ending or -beginning events were commemorated during the Early Postclassic period (ca. A.D. 800-1100), dominated by Chich'en Itza and the powerful Itza lineages and their allies in northern Yucatan.17 The reasons for the return of time-based, Classic Long Count-associated ritual and political organization at Mayapan are unknown. It might be related to known ethno political conflicts raging in the Postclassic Maya world, and recourse to tradition?the Long Count and its cosmo-political rituals?might have further bolstered the strongest of the ethno-political lin eages making up the multepal. Conclusion: Time, Power, and the Maya Classic Maya representations reveal that time was fundamentally animate: the days and the numbers that precede and differentiate them are anthropo morphic deities who carry units of time on a cos mic journey. These numbers had particular qualities of strength or weakness which, when combined with the day names, conferred similar?and a host of other?qualities to the day under consideration and the events transpiring during it. The 20 day names in the 260-day calendars throughout Mesoamerica are drawn from the phenomena of nature and include senses of rain/storm, grass/reeds, earth, crocodile, snake, wind, death, moon, and so on. Indeed, these names are not only identical but they often occur in the same order from calendar to calendar (Edmonson 1988:169), supporting the likelihood that this 260-day continuous time</page><page sequence="18">292 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 __b_?^5_^^* ? % "^'^V ^CvSBB^Il^*,,^&gt;5?_35H______,'*, ^^^&gt;%? - Y"*^9bSHH*'?^**^v_^pi?b Figure 5. Stone turtle effigy from Mayapan with 13 ajaw divisions of the may around the edge of the carapace (redrawn from Houston et al. 2006:Fig. 2.43). reckoning device developed very early in Mesoamerican prehistory, before the invention of script traditions. The creation of names for periods of time animated and personified them, making it easier to maintain temporal records orally. Control of time might be partially manifest in the use of animals for some day names: in the Popol Vuh the animals were created in the first creation, but because they could not pray to the gods "their flesh was brought low: they served, they were eaten, they were killed" by the superior humans (Tedlock 1996:68). Animals were inferior to?hence vic tims of?humans. Analogously, the modern high land Tzeltal Maya name a sequence of 13 20-day intervals that correspond to 13 stages of growing maize (Stross 1994), a sequence that correlates with 13 Yukatekan day names in the 260-day calendar corresponding to the head variants for numerals 1 through 13. The Maya, like all Mesoamericans, "controlled" maize in the sense of having long ago domesticated it. Its continued growth was mechan ically a consequence of Maya farmers placing grains in the earth, but in supernatural terms the suc cess of maize was owed to the successful propiti ation of the Maize God(s), who was often impersonated by rulers. Units of time?accumulations of quantities of days?in the Classic Maya Long Count are often represented by zoomorphs. Rare full-figure glyphs include a monkey standing for the day or k'in, a frog or toad for the 20-day winal, and a raptor for the longer k'atun and b'ak'tun. In the Postclassic period, the series of 13 k'atuns of the may was rep resented by a turtle (Figure 5). It is unclear why these animals were selected, but the choices might relate to creation myths. I have proposed that the Popol Vuh origin myth of the K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands is, in part, an allegory reca pitulating the development of the Maya calendars (Rice 2007). In the extant version of this myth a frog/toad plays only a small part, but there are numerous avians, including owls, a falcon, and the false sun, Seven Macaw. It might be significant that avians and amphibians/herpetofauna are liminal transformation creatures. Birds' homes may be on earth, in water, or in the sky; they therefore tran scend the three realms of the natural world, and early depictions of humans in bird costume are thought to represent shamans in transformation (Guernsey Kappelman 2001). At least partially because of this, birds represent messengers, par ticularly between cosmic realms, the word</page><page sequence="19">Rice] TIME, POWER, AND THE MAYA 293 mut/muut meaning both "word, tidings" and "bird" (Houston et al. 2006:229-251). Toads, particularly Bufo marinus, shed their skin while simultaneously consuming it, making them striking symbols of cyclical renewal: as it periodically sheds its skin, the toad "reenacts the cosmic drama of transfor mation and renewal" (Kennedy 1982:281; also Furst 1981:158). The choice of the turtle for the k 'atun round of the may, as indicated by carved tur tles at Mayapan, is based on the 13 divisions or scutes of the carapace of the green sea turtle (Che Ionia my das) and the terrestrial box turtle (Ter rapene mexicana) (Taube 1988:186). These time representations define the Maya's standard temporal reference framework. The Maya observed a complex system of intersecting standard units of time, all regarded as living creatures, usu ally apotheosized, and as burdens carried on cos mic journeys with a beginning, resting areas, and a destination. Time was both cyclical and linear in its movement, with the cyclical model (cosmic time) linguistically and mechanically subsuming the linear or secular (see Farriss 1987:573-574). Years always began on one of four days (in the 260-day calendar) known as "yearbearers." Major variations among Mesoamerican and Maya calen dars were based in part on the days chosen as year bearers. The Classic or Tikal calendar of the Maya used one set of four, but a different calendar with different yearbearers and other features was intro duced into the western lowlands in the Late Clas sic period. These changes, which have been described as "Mexican" (as opposed to Maya) and were incorporated into the Postclassic calendar, meant a slight though meaningful transformation in the temporal reference framework of the Maya and were a source of conflict in Yucatan for cen turies. In the Colonial period, still other changes in Maya calendars were attempted, with a major com promise calendar agreed upon in 1539; other revi sionist efforts included extending the k'atun from 20 to 24 years as a basis for yet another calendar in 1752 (Edmonson 1988:262-264). Such alter ations and conflicts illustrate Joyce Marcus's (1992:118) point about calendrical proliferation throughout Mesoamerica: revised calendars were developed and promulgated by different ethno linguistic groups and thus acquired "political and ethnic significance." Calendars, then, mapped the fundamental contours of Mesoamerican societies' identities and worldviews. The relations between time/calendars and power among the Maya were noted fairly early by Syl vanus G. Morley (Morley and Brainerd 1946:230): "The priests' awesome knowledge of the move ments of the heavenly bodies must have been a source of tremendous power to them. It proved to the ignorant masses that the priesthood held close and intimate communion with their greatest deities and so must be obeyed." This observation was not elaborated, however. In the terms of modern social and educational anthropology, these priests pos sessed the cognitive tools or specialized knowl edge, the "mystical means of reproduction" of the social group, of nature, and of the cosmos (Gode lier 1978; Santos Granero 1986). The Maya's ani mation of units of time and of entities in nature and the cosmos calls to mind Santos Granero's (1986:661) comments about the relations between personification of the environment and power: "once the natural environment is personified (once nature becomes a subject in the actors' minds) peo ple think of themselves as engaged in a power rela tion with it." And it is a human shaman or daykeeper or calendar priest who is commonly the point of engagement in these power relations (perhaps the full-figure images of anthropomorphs struggling with raptor/time representations illustrate such power contests). An important responsibility of early calendar priests/daykeepers in Mesoamerica would have been to manipulate the auguries of the 260-day calendar to ascertain the gods' views of propitious times or probable outcomes for elite/group activities, a role that continues today in some highland communities (B. Tedlock 1992a). Cyclical calendars recorded the cycles of natural phenomena?the skies, the seasons?but the goal of the generations of daykeepers who guarded this knowledge was not simply to understand these cycles empirically; rather, the goal was to influence the future they presaged through manipulation of social and cosmic order (Miller 1986:19, 21). Although early Mayanists like Morley and Thompson believed the ancient Maya were ruled by a priesthood (calendar priests or otherwise), scholarship over the last half century has revealed this to be incorrect. Nonetheless, the view that the Classic civilization was in some senses a theocracy still can be defended (Rice 2004:284-286). It may be questioned whether Classic Maya rulers were</page><page sequence="20">294 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 19, No. 3, 2008 themselves high priests or calendar priests (aj k'in),ls or minimally, educated in such traditions, as were public figures in Postclassic Yucatan. It is probably more likely that they were aided by specialists?perhaps royal astronomer mathematician scribes known as aj kuju'un (Coe and Van Stone 2001:13)?who maintained the cal endar and its prognostications for warfare, trade, public and private ritual, and so on. Classic Maya rulers were divine or sacred as indicated by their titles (k 'ul or k 'ujul 'holy, sacred') and by the paraphernalia they wore, carried, or oth erwise displayed in their portraits on stelae and elsewhere. These include masks, headdresses, pec torals, belts, and ceremonial bars and staffs, all elaborated with celestial symbols. In particular, Maya dynasts were earthly embodiments of the sun, both in life and in death. Their "control" of the movements of the sun, which was their patron, had roots in the Preclassic development of the calen dars and the Long Count dating scheme, and blos somed to full expression during the Classic period. The Long Count itself represents sacred time. When carved on stelae to anchor kingly ritual to the coor dinates of that sempiternal realm, a Long Count date took the participants?the sovereign as divine actor, and the observers of the monument forever after?back to the same point in the mythical past: the time of the gods, ancestors, and mythic heroes, and the beginning of the cosmos. Control of time conferred on the ruler, his hege mony, and his realm the legitimation of the cosmos, and this was manifest in time-based geopolitical organization. Dynastic legitimation was regularly proclaimed via dated stelae: a strong historical con sciousness that situated all royal events and rituals within a cosmic framework dating from the cur rent creation in 3114 B.C. Such historical con sciousness was widely shared throughout Mesoamerica. The Maya, like the Postclassic Mex ica (Aztecs) of central Mexico, viewed history as "the result of a dialectic between the past and the present.... Current happenings were interpreted to fit patterns established by the past, and the past was reconceived to accommodate present circum stances" (Umberger 1987:63). Farriss (1987) refers to this as "remembering the future and anticipat ing the past." Classic Maya dynasts wielded an impressive toolkit as part of their earthly roles and responsi bilities of kingship. Chief among these was indi vidual agency in overseeing "the collective enter prise of survival phrased in calendrical terms" (Miller 1986:23) as well as in terms of cosmic cycling. Leadership in warfare, success in the ball game, abundance in agricultural production, and trade in exotic goods appear to have been major responsibilities of sovereigns, along with related ceremonial obligations. But the foundation of kingly power did not lie in any of these secular realms. Instead, that power was cosmo-political, based on esoteric knowledge strategically deployed to create illusions of control of time and the cos mos. Ultimately, "time itself was the sacred ruler; humans were merely its mortal and temporal cus todians" (Rice 2007:202). Acknowledgments. This article presents the theoretical and comparative perspectives underlying my interest in time, cal endrics, and the Maya, which constitute the foundation for my two monographs on their interrelations (Rice 2004, 2007). I am grateful to my graduate students in a seminar on "Time and the Maya," who provided me with the opportunity (and necessity!) to think more broadly about these issues. Colleagues Don Rice and Andy Hofling read earlier versions of this manuscript and I appreciate their encouragement. Editor Mark Aldenderfer, Tony Aveni, David Freidel, and two anonymous reviewers for Latin American Antiquity pro vided valuable clarifications and citations that I gratefully incorporated into the final version of this text, and also many suggestions for interesting amplifications that were pre cluded by concerns about length.

Another categorization of time identifies physical (or natural), mundane (ages), and typological (chronology building) time (Fabian 1983), the latter two having been used in anthropological and archaeological discourses in distanc ing, objectifying, and exoticizing "the Other" (Stahl 1993:237; also Chazan 1995). 2. Cognitive tools, like all tools, are culturally mediated devices that permit humans to process something in the nat ural world more efficiently physically or, in the cognitive case, mentally. Calendars may be considered cognitive tools that organize complex knowledge of time and its passage so as to facilitate its strategic manipulation toward human ends. 3. Two of three English words that entered the Muria vocabulary are "time" and "power." 4. See also Sahlins' (1968:12) ceremonial division of labor among kin groups. 5. At the extreme end of the socio-economic complexity model is modern Western society, especially the United States, with a capitalist system, punctuality as a supreme virtue, and time commodified as money (Movahedi 1985:387-388; Smith 1996). 6. Two reviewers urged me to give attention to the rela tions among time, pilgrimages, and market fairs, particularly citing Freidel's (1981) work. I concur on their salience and address them elsewhere (Rice 2008a, 2008b). 7. For more information on Maya calendars, consult The Ancient Maya (Sharer and Traxler 2006), Chapter 3. 8. The August 11 starting date is arbitrary, depending on which of several schemes is used to correlate the Maya cal endar to modern ones, Gregorian or Julian (see Sharer and Traxler 2006:114). In the Gregorian calendar, the most com mon correlations are with August 11 or 13; in the Julian, the dates fall in September. 9. One might think of this, by analogy to "multivariate space," as "multi-temporal" space. 10.1 propose that early observations of the cyclical regu larities of various celestial and seasonal phenomena were for malized into calendars roughly as follows (Rice 2007): The invention of the 260-day calendar probably occurred by or around 2000 B.C., at the time of increasing adoption of agri culture and sedentary lifeways. The names/senses of the 20 days in 260-day calendars throughout Mesoamerica are nearly identical and occur in the same order (Edmonson 1988:169), suggesting that this calendar developed very early, perhaps around 2000 B.C. The 365-day solar calendar devel oped quickly out of the 260-day calendar, likely by 1500 B.C. and the two were coordinated into the Calendar Round. The next step was innovation of a sign system (ultimately becom ing a formal script) to represent the units of each calendar. The Long Count, used only by the Epi-Olmec (Late Preclassic Gulf coastal region) and the Maya, might have been conceived toward the end of the second millennium B.C. as a count of k'atuns, but not committed to representa tion in permanent media (stone) until considerably later. The start of the Long Count in August, 3114 B.C., represents a strong historical memory of seasonally scheduled settlement aggregations and associated rituals related to solar cycling, preserved in oral traditions among the earliest daykeepers. Aveni (2002:187) proposed that the Long Count was orig inated by "a person or class of persons," presumably power ful priests or ruler-priests, who desired to expand records of durational time, thereby stabilizing the present by retrodict ing it into nearly incomprehensibly ancient times. This would have been a useful tool for dynasts anchor their hereditary power, genealogies, and control of time back in the epoch of creation and Time's beginnings. 11. Maya creation stories share similarities with widespread myths throughout Mesoamerica, which may have had a com mon origin, probably in the lowlands, and may have begun in the Archaic period (Flannery 1976:344-345; Scheie 1992:2). 12. Taube (1988:201nl0) notes that "prehispanic calen dar wheels are only known in stone sculpture, not in painted manuscripts." 13. The bird head with a hand in place of the mandible in the k'atun and b'ak'tun glyphs recalls the story in the Popol Vuh of the arrogant Seven Macaw, who proclaimed himself the sun and the moon. The Hero Twin Hunahpu shot Seven Macaw with his blowgun and broke his jaw, causing his teeth to fall out, whereupon Seven Macaw returned home, "holding his jaw very carefully" (Tedlock 1996:78-79). 14. In Mesoamerica, individuals were given birth names reflecting their natal date in the 260-day calendar, and the day's auguries were believed to foretell something about the person's fates. In Africa, the Luo of Kenya often bear time based names that reflect "a time of day, a season of the year, a stage in a temporal sequence, or an historical event" (Dietler and Herbich 1993:249). 15. The length of the k'atun, -20 years, also approximates what demographers consider a generation in ancient times, and this might have been a factor in the origins of the k'atun as a significant period of time to celebrate (Rice 2007:215n4; see also "generational time," Dietler and Herbich 1993:252-253; Evans-Pritchard 1940; Gell 1996:17-18). 16. According to Edmonson (1985:265), the b'ak'tun (Long Count) calendar was ended by the new Valladolid cal endar in 1752, and "abbreviated" may and k'atun ceremonies were celebrated as late as 1824. 17. This period and area of the lowlands saw the intro duction of new calendrical practices in the Late Classic period, which might provide a partial explanation. 18. The earliest glyphic reference to this title is in the eighth century at Xcalumkin (D. Freidel, personal communi cation, 2/13/07), suggesting that it was likely used orally for some time before it appeared in sculpture.
