<plain_text><page sequence="1">To Hunt the Black Shaman: Memory of the Great Purge in East Siberia.* Heonik Kwon, University of Edinburgh The inalienable quality of every Bolshevik under present conditions should be the ability to recognise an enemy of the Party no matter how well he may be masked. Joseph Stalin, 1936 I repeat - our most merciless enemy is our past. Maxim Gorky, 1917 In Darkness at Noon, published when Stalin's political violence was at its pinnacle in the Soviet Union, Arthur Koestler speaks through Rubashov's monologue that Stalin's Russia is a 'black magic' for historians. In order to understand the origin of the totalitarian terror, according to Koestler (1941:12), historians must consider not only all the objective historical factors which they believe conditioned the genocide, but also the subjective reflection of these factors in Stalin's mind. Until the historians are able to penetrate 'a grey foggy landscape between the second and third lobes of No.l's brain', he concludes, history would be 'more of an oracle than a science'. Partly thanks to the release of some of the secret archive sources, many more facts are available now about the reality of the Great Terror (1924-1953) than in Koestler's time. These excavated facts, as Hobsbawm (1998:321) predicts, may force all the past historical writings on the subject soon to be dropped out of sight. Armed with archival sources and eyewitness reports from the survivors, the historical explanation of Stalin's Terror should now be able to turn into more of a science than an oracle. The situation, however, somewhat betrays this anticipation. In fact, the more the details of the systematic state terror are disclosed, the more mysterious its origin tends to become. Instead of the mysterious mind of a single individual, the historian now has a whole set of minds to penetrate into. In his recent bestseller on the social memory of Stalinism, Adam Hochschild (1993) pushes historical analogy to its limit. He claims, in line with the revisionist view (Fitzpatrick 1986; Getty and Manning 1993), that the origin of the totalitarian terror cannot be reduced to a ETNOFOOR, XTH(l) 2000, pp. 33-50 33</page><page sequence="2">single pathological mind or to a secret circle of power-mongers as an extension of this mind. Instead of demonising Stalin and his Politburo, Hochschild proposes that the 'psychosis' of Stalin's Purge should be seen through the prism of the 'mass hysteria' of European Inquisition (1993:172-175). Stalin's Purge was like an epidemic that, once released to the air, obliterates the distinction between the victim and the carrier of the disease. In support of this epidemic metaphor, Hochschild presents a number of interviews with ordinary Russians, whose memories of the inter-war period often invoke contradictory emotional reactions of anger and guilt.1 It is in the memoirs of Evgenia Semyonovna Ginzburg - a survivor of Siberian exile and prominent writer of the Stalinist era - that we witness a kind of sublimation, if I am permitted to use this word in this context, of self-contradictory reactions to the memory of the Great Purge. In her Journey into the Whirlwind (1967), Ginzburg employs the idea of 'previous life' to speak of the curious narrative phenomenon that the author is unable to tell her prepurge life history except as if it was someone else's story. She states that she who narrates is not the same person as she who was a Bolshevik intellectual in Kazan and mother of two children before her arrest. For Ginzburg, the life of this other woman in her ended in 1937, and it has no continuity to her 'this life' of exile and rehabilitation. Ginzburg indicates that Stalin split her past into two lives, and she pleads to the reader that she is unable to integrate the story of her previous life with that of her 'this life' in the given form of autobiography. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the commemoration of the victims of Stalinist atrocities has attracted public attention both inside and outside the former Soviet Union. Lists of victims were printed weekly in Russian local press, and a number of new memoirs came to light. The controversial Pamiatnik monument in honour of Gulag victims, made from stone from the notorious Solovietsky corrective labour camp, was opened in 1990 (Schwarcz 1994: 54) . In response to this rising memorial movement in Russia and East-Central Europe, Todorov (1995:11-12) writes that for those who choose to take the burden of telling the experience of totalitarian terror, their narrative acts are a revolt and already 'an act of opposition to power', since what a totalitarian regime fears most are discourses about itself. Milan Kundera has a similar view: 'The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting' (Kundera 1981:3; Esbenshade 1995:74; Schwarcz 1994: 55) . This quest for memory-as-resistance and its derivative, 'the return of the repressed', are becoming an increasingly familiar topic in the scholarship of postcommunist societies (Esbenshade 1995; Denish 1994; Humphrey 1994:26; Verdery 1999; Watson 1994:14 17; Zizek 1999:45). There is one question, however, in this rendering of the politics of narrative acts. If narration of state terror is already a political rebellion, what happens to the voice the very narrative practice has to put to silence in its political engagement? What happens to Ginzburg's silent 'other woman in me'? Does this woman have any political agency? This, the voice of the other self in political action, is the question I wish to think about. Ginzburg is not alone in experiencing this radical rupture in one's storied self-identity. Similar phenomena are reported among other survivors of systematic political terror (Block 34</page><page sequence="3">1965; Das 1992; Mendelstam 1976; Vidali 1996). In East Siberia, biographical stories are also constrained by a form of radical discontinuity. The Orochon, a native people of Sakhalin Island, are generally silent about the time of 'Repression' (repressiya), which for them primarily refers to the notorious Stalin-Yezhoz years of 1937-8.2 Their silence incorporates not only an individual's tragic past but also aspects of the group's prepurge life. The Orochon tell stories about a man who was the first native official in the Soviet administration and a mystical hero who fought a secret war against the Japanese. While these stories describe in graphic detail the heroes' success in hunting, their love affairs and other adventures, they never touch upon the circumstances of their arrest and death during the early days of the Repression. Moreover, accounts of their traditional religious life are extremely difficult to obtain, for the informants consciously and systematically avoid the topic. In Siberia, as elsewhere in Soviet Russia, the Purge rhetorically waged a total warfare against the 'dark' and 'backward' past (Slezkine 1994:226), and the enemies of this militant movement were subjective memories as well as objective emblems of the past (Koestler 1941:80). Just as Ginzburg is unable to integrate her prepurge life to her memoir of purge years, so do Orochon hero tales fail, inversely, to extend to the purge years of some of their favourite characters. Recent ethnographic studies of political violence discuss this split representation in historical narratives with an emphasis on ritual. In his analysis of Cuna social history in Columbia, Taussig (1987) describes how memories of colonial violence, unexplored in ordinary conversations, develop to powerful political statements in their shamanic incantations. The Karo of Indonesia are silent about violent deaths of the past as a rule, according to Steedley (1993), whereas the circumstances of these deaths are abruptly recalled during their healing rites where the order of everyday life is temporarily suspended. The Cheju shaman of Korea, in Kim's (1989) description, may regress to the government's brutal handling of the local communist guerrilla forces in order to find the backgrounds of her client's illness and thus functions as a subversive historian who fills the blank pages of the official history. Connerton (1989) also considers ritual performance as a privileged instrument of social memory, albeit from a different angle. Rather than the scheme that ritual reality inverts the order of everyday social reality and thus facilitates what is inexpressible in ordinary language to take an alternative communicative form, he assigns the mnemonic function of ritual actions to the inner structure of ritual performance. He argues that ritual actions are marked by their 'formalism' - the idea that actions are encoded in prescribed orders and manners - and 'invariance' through time (1989:53-61). Connerton pursues this point with comparison to myths, which he believes are susceptible to creative variance. Actions are encoded in the performance of a ritual and their statuses unquestioned, according to him, whereas elements of a myth are open and vulnerable to the inventive reinterpretation of individual narrators. This currently popular idea of ritual memory poses problem to the historical studies of a society such as the Orochon, much of whose collective ritual tradition has been coerced to discontinue by systematic political repression. If rituals are an embodiment of cultural 35</page><page sequence="4">memory, it is understandable, although with great hesitance, why political elite in certain situations of radical social transformation wish not to see them continue. This article deals with this problem, methodical as well as epistemological, of the concept of ritual memory in coercively secularised societies, and will argue through a case analysis that the mnemonic function of a ritual may extend far beyond the rite's actual performance. My argument is basically that ritual is much more than a performance and that the unperformed rituals of a society, because of the very fact that they are discontinued and absent from the material reality, can tell us much about the society. Absence is not always the opposite of presence. The presence of absence is also empirical. Sometimes, it can even be a social fact. The case concerns a traditional Orochon healing rite, which, discontinued in the turmoil of Stalin's terror, is told today by Orochon mythical tales. I will describe the radical symbolic transformations the rite undergoes in its movement to myth, and will explore how these transformations demonstrate the paradox of expressing the violent loss of traditional cultural forms through the mediation of the very vanished form. Dialogue of stories Olya, a disabled woman in her thirties, is an exception to the general absence of the Great Terror in the Orochon discourse. Olay was nearly killed in a road accident a few years previously and suffered a head injury which now hampers her speech and mobility. In the evenings she is often seen in her neighbour's sitting room. Sitting insecurely on the sofa bed with her walking stick tightly gripped in her hand, she suddenly initiates a high-pitched chant. When she sings, Olya does not stutter. Her song is always about her late grandfather, a purge victim, and it has the refrain, 'Nobody speaks for me. Everyone is silent. Nobody speaks for me.' Everyone in the room ignores her wailing, apart from the children who look at her with curiosity, tending the animal hide or watching the television as if nothing unusual is happening. There are other exceptional occasions in which memories of the Purge make their way through the spell of silence. Purge victims constitute an important element in Orochon funeral songs. Their mortuary songs typically develop to a biography of the deceased, and, in doing so, introduce various other characters to the key events of the dead person's life. These narrative characters may be the singer herself, or other participants of the commemorative gathering, or the people of the past who died in similar circumstances. For a woman who died of tuberculosis in a town hospital, the songs speak of other tuberculosis victims and the victims of other epidemic diseases in the more distant past. These are followed by some nameless figures, which were taken, like the dead person, to the same town (during the purge years) and never seen since. Other than particular commemorative situations such as this, Stalin's Great Purge remains in a suspended space of history whose truth is neither denied nor confirmed by the Orochon. And their silence continues even today when to curse the name of Joseph Stalin is no longer a crime but has become part of everyday language among neighbouring Russians. 36</page><page sequence="5">For the Orochon it requires particular commemorative contexts to speak of a purge victim, and apart from these more formalised contexts, the stories they tell to one another show no indication of the victim's tragic death. Accounts of a past hero's thrilling bear hunt, for instance, and his gifted eyes that measure the depth of the frozen surface of the lagoon are kept strictly separate from the telling of this man's confusion in face of his irnminent doom at a session of political confession. This phenomenon of selective representation or split representation entails that the story of the bear hunt and the song of the self-accusation, while they are told separately with seemingly no connection to each other, can be considered as constituent parts of one longer story. This is not, however, simply because the two tales belong to one identical historical figure. The hunter in the bear hunt story is full of courage and confidence, and this is in sharp contrast to the confusion and powerlessness the commemorative song describes of him to the extent that it is hard to believe that they are about the same physical person. Once aware that the story and the song are parts of one man's biography, however, the bear hunt story appears loaded with meanings that were not available from within the story alone. The bear hunter sets off to the forest in silent disapproval of a neighbour who refused to share his gain with a starving relative. He kills a bear with his axe and gives the gain away to all his neighbours. This is thus a moral hunt, aimed to restore the principle of nimgakan ('sharing', originally an Evenk term), and the hunter is an unchallenged culture hero. This background, however, is not available in the actual story of the bear hunt told among the Orochon hunters. The men's story focuses on the hero's narrow escape from the prey's deadly paw attack and his artful jump to the axe he had mistakenly dropped in his effort to reload his gun. The background of the moral hunt is given instead in a story circulated amongst women. In the women's version, the hero appears to have killed three bears instead of one and he left for the forest with only his axe in the first place. While I personally consider that the men's version is more faithful to the concrete details of a bear hunt, it is nevertheless only in the women's version that one has access to the identity of the antihero, who violated the nimgakan principle in the first place. And this man, according to a long-time Russian neighbour of the Orochon, was particularly critical of the bear hunter during the public meeting that decided his fate. If we situate the bear hunt story in a complex dialogue with other tales and songs about the hunter, it appears that the men's story speaks of the hero's ill fate tacitly, but no less powerfully than the funeral chant that evokes his doomed political confession. The story describes the hero as a gifted hunter of unusual courage, and this description, supplemented by the background of the hunt in the women's story, develops to a celebration of the man's righteousness. The hero appears as a man of virtues who risks mortal dangers to achieve justice; hence, the story testifies against the cruel judgement of 1937, which probably condemned this man according to the logic of the mask I quoted in the epigraph. The telling and retelling of this brave bearhunter's story can then be considered as a critical response to the opposite scene of purge, partly depicted in the funeral song, when this hunter stood as prey in helpless confusion to be cornered and finally hunted down. Hence, the story of the bearhunt already implicates the story of the manhunt in it and 37</page><page sequence="6">is in no way less politically powerful than the latter. This entails that attention on ritual memory may be handicapped by its very efficacy; speaking of purge victims as culture hero in daily storytelling, with no indication of their tragic fate, can be as critical as invoking their negative identity in a formal ritual context. The absence of terror in men's stories, in other words, should be considered as 'absence of presence' in dialectical relationship to its presence in women's songs. If the reverse of this statement is also true, we can conclude that the location of commemoration is in the relationship between different (e.g. gender specific) representational practices rather than an isolated representational product. Furious Object Bearing in mind this dialogical relationship among the stories the Orochon tell of their past heroes, let me turn to a particular class of stories they call ningma. I will discuss two ningma stories. The first one does not have a title, so I will name it as 'Furious Object'. I had heard this ningma story from an elderly Orochon woman just before she passed away. The other story to be introduced later was recited by a young Orochon hunter. This one has its original title, 'Believe It or Not' (Veri Hi ne veri). Ningma is the Orochon term that has the double meaning of 'storytelling' or 'singing' on the one hand and 'to invite spirits' or 'to shamanise' on the other (Vasilevich 1936; 1963:192). I translated this term to 'myth' in my previous work (Kwon 1999:382). Furious Object begins with two Russian visitors, a man and a young woman, who are seated next to an Orochon woman. The husband of this woman is not at home. The woman thinks that she does not like entertaining strangers while her husband is hunting, but she does not say this to the guests. The visitors ask about the amulets the hostess kept in her sewing toolbox. The hostess refuses three times. The first time, she says she has no amulets. The second time, she says her amulets are too old to be anything near a gift. The third time, she tells the visitors that they should ask a carver to make them new amulets. Then, the fourth time, she finds that she cannot think of any other excuse and feels uneasy to have to be impolite once again. So, alone at midnight, she whispers farewell songs to the amulets, worried that she might awake the children. She sang to the amulets if they agreed to go with the visitors. The amulets danced to her songs in agreement. The following morning she hands over the amulets to the visitors who are then happily preparing to return home. Back home, the visitors do not keep the amulets for themselves. They hand over the objects to their boss - the museum's curator. In the museum, when lights are gone and people are asleep, the amulets suddenly become furious. Then one calamity follows another in the woman's family. The woman buries her husband and her son. Heart-broken and starving, her daughter-in-law runs away with a man. The amulets are once again furious. The following spring, two frozen bodies - of a young woman and a young man clutching each other - are found under the melting snow. 38</page><page sequence="7">The amulets that appear in this story are Orochon soso sewe ('e' pronounced as in perch). The term sewe refers to the native figurative art of East Siberia in general, and for the Orochon, it is a generic name for their carved objects in anthropomorphic forms. Among other ethnic groups in the region, images of animals and imaginary beings, made of bone or metal, are also included in the category. Sewe carvings were widely produced until the beginning of the twentieth century, and were reportedly used for curative, commemorative, and divination purposes (Shirokogoroff 1935). As with the Orochi and the Nanai people of the region, the Orochon remember sewe carvings with reference to the object's efficacy in healing ceremonies in particular. These originally shamanic objects are depicted as 'guardian spirits' (Harva 1959:254-267) of human individuals (or animal herds) in ethnographic literature, but the natives themselves typically describe them as 'god' (bog, in Russian) when they are obliged to. The production of sewe carvings was traditionally an esoteric domain of clan shamans (sama, in Orochon). Some shamans are known to have practised carving themselves, while others performed only yayoni or ningmaxani, an initiation rite to 'place spirits' to the objects prepared by other specialists bakche. It is an established view (Hamayon 1995:265-267) that warfare or battle is the dominant metaphor of Siberian healing rites. To perform a warrior's violent anger was also a principal component of the traditional Orochon healing practices. Implements for the Orochon domestic healing rites typically consisted of fire, axe, milk, and sewe carvings. The patient was laid next to the hearth, and the axe was placed above the fire and the patient. The particular sewe that corresponded to the symptom of the patient was then suspended above the patient and the axe. When the blade of the axe turned red with the heat from the fire, milk was spitted onto it and this opened a series of chanting. The chant moved progressively from gentle persuasions, that the disease spirit should leave the patient at peace, towards more aggressive threats. The axe was used also to threaten the disease spirit, pointed to the part of the patient's body where the disease spirit was believed to dwell. Sewe carvings were associated with their proneness to tagjini; to fall into a state of fury. Being furious in this context is a 'positive' state, as Hamayon describes (1990:522-527) in contrast to 'negative rage', for it is intended to restore bodily and social order. In order to remain 'positive', however, the emotion must be contained and directed by ritual organisations, for tagjini can be also a 'negative' agent of sickness and misfortunes in the traditional beliefs of the Orochon. A good example of this double connotation of tagjini is the work of the carved object, huniku sewe. The term huniku refers to food objects offered to nature spirits or parts of game distributed to neighbours and kinsmen. Suppose a hunter killed a bear and failed to share the game with his hungry neighbour; the neighbour's desire (geleni) for the animal fat grows and transforms to tagjini. The same process takes place if the hunter ignored sharing the fruit of his hunting with nature spirits. The spirit of river, for instance, may become angry with the hunter because its desire for the flesh of the land animal is ignored. The anger of the neighbour or the river spirit will then take the body of the hunter as a substitute for game and seek satisfaction there in the form of 39</page><page sequence="8">an illness. In this system, between a symptom (intestinal disorder or high fever) and its cause (to fail to share food) lies a 'double symbolic movement' (Obeyesekere 1990:17) of passion: the transformation of desire (for game) to anger, and the opposite development of anger to desire (for human body). The remedy for a symptom was to reverse the symbolic movement of symptom formation. In the ritual chanting, the sewe spirit persuades the disease spirit to revert from the patient's body to a non-human substitute as the object of its wish fulfilment. An offering of animal blood and fat is supplied for this purpose. In case this peaceful persuasion proved to be unsuccessful, the sewe spirit would get impatient and angry in the ensuing chant. By this time, the carving was attached to the part of the patient's body in pain, and an attendant would simulate stroking this part with an axe. A chosen domestic reindeer was fastened to the back of the tent where this battle of spirits was taking place. The disease spirit, intimidated by the sewe spirit and chased away from the patient's body, was to take refugee in the animal's body. The ambiguity or double meaning of fury both as destructive and restorative emotional condition, which Hamayon meticulously elaborates as a key element of Siberian shaman ism, is observable in various other aspects of Orochon life. While the Orochon explicitly disapprove of people who fail to contain their anger, violent confrontations - verbal or physical - are easily accepted and even considered necessary in particular circumstances such as funerals or commemorative gatherings. Their nomadic pattern itself consists in an oscillation between controlled peace and controlled crisis in the way that hard feelings between the hunters, rarely expressed during the duration of a stay, are let loose vigorously while they are breaking the tents to prepare for migration. Outside these socially accepted contexts, falling into an emotional state of tagjini is strongly discouraged, and repeated failures can jeopardise interpersonal relations. To go back to the story of Furious Object, we notice in this story that the carving, once moved to the museum, flies into fury in the opposite sense to the way this passion was defined in the traditional healing rite. Rather than a weapon of the warrior against disease spirits, the carving's fury commands illness and misfortune, causing a series of deaths to the family it was previously attached to. The ancient guardian spirit transforms to a furious conqueror of human life to repeatedly terrorise the defenceless woman. In Furious Object, the museum objects become furious but there is no indication as to why these amulets become furious and what exactly they are furious about. The objects' relocation from the private toolbox to the public space of the museum may aid explanation, for it was improper in the Orochon tradition to have sewe carvings exposed to outsiders. The reason is that contacts with outsiders, which include members of other clans, may facilitate the development of their ill wishes to concrete manifestations. The donor of the amulets in the story violates this rule against exposure, and the subsequent deaths in her family may then be understood as being related to an act of sorcery by the outsiders whom the objects were exposed to. I feel very reluctant to subscribe to this interpretation. Being an ethnographer and a museum lover myself, it is not pleasant to think of the possibility that I may be acting as 40</page><page sequence="9">an agent of sorcery even in the imaginary world of myth. Fortunately, this interpretation is cancelled out by an element of dialogue within the story. Informed of the parting, the objects concede to the woman's proposition of exposure during her midnight divination. They dance the gesture of agreement to their imminent move to the museum. Hence, it happens that the story of Furious Object has already armed itself against the above explanation of sorcery - one that is most plausible within the story's cultural background - and calls for a different expository strategy. There was one actual historical episode when sewe carvings were apparently associated with mortal terror. It happened when the first snow fell in the year of 1937. The Orochon elders in Val were terrified to hear the rumour that authorities were arresting people who were in possession of suspicious objects or the goods of foreign origin. The rumour was already a reality among the Nivkh natives in the neighbouring town of Nogliki. They consulted with a then young Orochon man who had worked for the Bolshevik Revolutionary Cornmittee as a secret agent, and followed his advice to eliminate the amulets and the dowry goods made of imported Manchurian silk. The empty can of American corn beef, which a man used to store bullet heads, also had to be buried. This man acquired the can from a long-distance trader, who travelled throughout the Soviet Far East during the civil war. Young men mounted their rider reindeer to warn relatives in Chaivo, Pil'tun, and other distant places. Some burned the dangerous objects in the forest and others buried them in the lineage burial grounds. A few hid their carvings underneath specially marked trees, as it turned out, in the hope of recovering them later. Most sewe carvings were practically eliminated in that cruel year of 1937, and despite this and other protective measures, a number of Orochon dai nari (big men), sagdi nari (old men) and jangye (learned men) were taken to the Okha and the Alexandrovsk prisons during 1937-9. A local historian recounts that one in every three adult male Orochon was repressed during the Yezhov years and thereafter. Some of these men are known to have perished in building the underwater tunnel across the Tatar Strait. Stephan (1992) reports that the Soviet Far East and Sakhalin was particularly vulnerable to the mass purges because of the previous American and Japanese commercial and political interventions in the territory. Grant (1995:100) describes further how the Sakhalin natives were disproportionately exposed to arbitrary arrests and summary executions. He finds the reason partly in the racial attitudes of the party officials, who increasingly turned to the native population in fulfilling their production quota of 'enemies' and competing with the productivity in other regions. Orochon families traditionally raised a small herd of domestic reindeer, which they used mainly for transportation, and this 'property' also became one of the main threats during the purge. All Orochon were then categorically kulaks in the official view, and this ungrounded accusation was pursued in contrast to the Evenk and Negidal nomadic hunters, who in the early 1920s lost the bulk of their domestic herd to the so-called Reindeer King of Sakhalin, notorious Yakut trader Vinokurov (Kantorovich 1965:12-68). These dispossessed and Christianised Evenk were proletariat, in the official classification, whereas the Orochon, who had been relatively more isolated from the outside world, 41</page><page sequence="10">were property owners. Tensions that arise today between the Orochon and their Evenk neighbours are not entirely unrelated to this dark history of misguided class struggle. It remains extremely difficult for an outsider to imagine, however, how people would have actually responded to this situation of what Hannah Arendt (1948:464) calls 'total terror', and I have no intention of trying to reconstruct it here. The point I wish to make here is simply that it will be equally difficult, at least for me, not to imagine a certain association between the museum object's fantastic terror in the story of Furious Object and the actual political terror of 1937.1 speculate that the dramatic narrative episode of the furious object is not entirely independent from the catastrophic historical event of mass burial, which forced the Orochon to decisively distance themselves from the objects as a class. Just as Ginzburg's biographical episodes keep returning to her 'social death' of 1937, so it seems that contemporary tales about the shamanic object must have a hidden relationship with the threshold of their cultural death in 1937. If we assume that the history is implicated in the myth, the following task is to establish a symbolic connection between the apparent 'death' of the objects and the imaginary deaths caused by the objects. Among existing approaches to symbolic transformation, critical or hermeneutical, it is Paul Ricoeur's reading of Freudian symbolism of death and violence that I believe offers a first possibility to relate the two forms of terror. In his essay on death instinct, Ricoeur deciphers that the role of culture - in Freud's philosophy - is to fight for life against death (Ricoeur 1970:302-309). In this global war, he continues that culture's 'supreme weapon is to employ internalised violence against externalised violence; its supreme ruse is to make death work against death' (1970:309). This 'supreme weapon' of culture consists of symbolic forms, according to Obeyesekere (1990:12) whose case study of South Asian religious ascetics draws extensively on Ricoeur's reading of Freud. Obeyesekere (1990: 57-68) considers substitution and inversion of meaning as two principal elements in the analysis of collective fantasies. Following him, symbolic transformation in the present case firstly refers to the inversion of meaning of the amulet from traditionally a device for healing to the very catalyst of death and misfortune. Secondly, it refers to a process of substitution (or a process of replacement by the opposite) that the victim of the terror - the destroyed amulets - substitutes for the very political terror as the object of the fear of death. However, there is one major problem in this rendering of symbolic transformation. Within the confines of the story Furious Object, there is no evidence or trace of Stalinist terror. Instead of the mass destruction of religious objects by terrified people, the background for the amulet's fury is rendered as the object's collection to a museum by peaceful means, which is far from the fear of death associated with the period of Repression. Again, what is at stake here is whether a relationship can be established between the narrative episode of three consecutive deaths and the historical event of the objects' mass death during the Purge. Given the absence of any indication of the mass burial in Furious Object, the symbolic regression - to bring a phenomenon to a hidden, deeper background - may be an alternative way to expand the story's background beyond its manifest content. This method, however, is loaded with problems especially when it 42</page><page sequence="11">is applied to the analysis of collective symbols. Unlike private symbols and fantasies, collective symbolic formations, including myth, are not easily collapsible to an 'analysis' of classical psychoanalytical type in which the authority of a given master scenario is unquestioned. In the absence of a certainty or 'the canon' (Crapanzano 1992:295) in the analytic project as in psychoanalysis, the analysis of cultural symbols should resist claims for a unified deeper background or a master plot, no matter how plausible the claim might sound (Obeyesekere 1990:xxiii-xxv, 274-284). Lambek suggests that the relational model in contemporary psychoanalysis (Lambek 1996:240) or communication model (Lambek 1980) can be an alternative to the classical drive model. I agree with him and propose that we can look for the background of a seemingly unintelligible symbol, if it is a collective symbol, in its dialogue with other shared representations rather than in the commanding voice of deep motivations. Believe It or Not In order to demonstrate the above point - dialogical relationship between collective symbols -1 will introduce an additional ningma story. My argument is this: the absence of Purge in Furious Object means more that this story is incomplete or 'not self-enclosed' (Dunne 1996:150) than that the background of Purge is concealed from the story's manifest content. Consider the following story, Believe It or Not. The hunter who narrated this story and his younger brother are known as master carvers in the Orochon community. Today, their carving activity concentrates on engraving realist images of nature and animals on practical devices such as knife-holders and saddles. The story Believe It or Not begins when a man called Black Shaman appears along the trail of a hunter. Black Shaman demands the hunter, who has been always sceptical of his power, to try to shoot him. The hunter pulls out an arrow from his quiver and points it to the shaman's leg. At night, this hunter goes back to his camp and finds that there is no trace of bleeding on Black Shaman's leg. The shaman grins at the hunter and asks, 'Do you believe me?' The hunter shakes his head to say no. This process of 'Believe It or Not' repeats three times. The hunter shoots two more arrows to the stomach and then the chest of Black Shaman and each time he fails to harm the shaman. When the hunter and the shaman meet for the third time in the camp, the shaman becomes furious, his eyes turn red and he cries, 'Do you believe me now?' And the hunter shakes his head violently from right to left three times, not uttering a word. The idea of 'black shaman' was one of the Soviet state's favourite metaphors during the anti-religion campaign and the Purge (Suslov 1931). During this period, all indigenous shamans appeared black, black being a colour code for all negative moral values in contrast to the image of electric bulbs and lighthouses that symbolised socialist enlightenment and 43</page><page sequence="12">the role of Party.3 This black shaman was the trickster and the masked exploiter of his people (Balzer 1983,1996:xiv-xv), and the act of winning him was deemed as a heroic deed and a necessary step for social progress.4 In contrast to this dark period of the thirties and early forties, the brief period after Stalin's death was an age of rehabilitation for the purge victims. During this period of liberalisation or 'thaw', young Soviet anthropologists made subtle efforts to challenge the Stalinist dogma and to rehabilitate previously suppressed indigenous religions in Siberia. Taksami (1967) indicates that the idea of culture was in its infancy during Stalin's time, and that many indigenous elements previously labelled as religious should have been considered as cultural practices or ethnic artefacts. In addition to this need for a redefinition of religion, critical concerns were expressed as to the disappearing indigenous traditions, and appeals were made for systematic measures for the recording and conservation of indigenous cultures (Gurvich 1960; Bromlei and Basilov 1976). In this atmosphere, skilled field researchers were dispatched to remote areas to collect linguistic data and material objects. It was due to an actual event that Orochon carvings were collected by a museum. This was in the late 1950s, after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 and Khrushchev's secret speech at the Twentieth Congress in January 1956 that denounced the former dictator's crimes. This period of 1957-9 is crucial also in Orochon economic history, for it was when their previous network of co-operatives, which had internally some autonomy and resemblance to their traditional territorial network, was transformed to a unified state enterprise under the drive of consolidation (ukrupnenie). The three consecutive deaths in Furious Object resemble the actual events that took place in an Orochon family in 1958-61, and this family, with two others, happened to have made contribution to the collection.5 It then seems clear that the story of Furious Object has, as its historical background, the end of terror and the rehabilitation of the victims rather than an experience of political terror. The story communicates with this historical background of cultural rehabilitation by sharing a living image of the shamanic amulet. However, the story goes much beyond the historical background of cultural restoration by inverting the meaning of the rehabilitated object from the authentic, namely a traditional device for healing, to its very opposite, the very source of disease and death. The vengeful fury of the carving is no longer the 'positive' anger performed in the ancient healing rites. Instead of being rehabilitated to its ancient position as a fearless guardian of the people, the carving takes on its historical identity, imposed by the state terror, as a fearsome enemy of the people. Contexture of myths In Furious Object, the amulets become furious once they are in the museum, but there is no indication in this story as to why these objects become furious and what they are furious at. The story of Believe It or Not, on the other hand, only describes why the shaman becomes furious - he is shot three times - and is also incomplete in the sense that it does not explain what the furious man will do with his anger. The incompleteness of 44</page><page sequence="13">each individual story can change to an attribute of complementarity, however, if the two stories are considered as constituent parts of a work told separately rather than separate works. Several factors support a unity of these two stories. First of all, it is noticed that the background in one story becomes the foreground in the other. The event of museum collection takes place while the woman's husband is absent, hunting in the forest, whereas the other event of shaman-hunting takes place in the forest while the hunter is alone on his hunting trail. This establishes the possibility of considering these two events as concomitant acts that are represented separately following the sexual division of labour. This aspect of concomitance becomes more evident if we consider that the shamanic object of soso sewe, among other sewe amulets, attended to Orochon women's private hunting divination.6 This divination typically took a form of dialogue in which the carving, suspended from the woman's hand, was to 'dance' vertically or to swing horizontally in response to particular questions she posed in her songs. The Orochon believed that this dialogue between women's 'song' and amulet's 'dance' was to free hunting trails from dangers. This synchronicity, or 'the play of [myths'] secret affinities' in Ricoeur's words (1969: 174), explains other structural similarities between the two stories. The hunter refuses to believe the power of the shaman three times; the woman refuses to hand over the shamanic amulets three times. Thus the failure of elimination evolves to the failure of retention. The shaman is shot three times; the family of the woman is revenged three times by the spirit of the amulet.7 Thus violence is reciprocated. What then are the implications of this comparative perspective to view these apparently separate stories as a single work? Firstly, I will argue that the narrative contexture not only represents a violent event of the past but also interprets the meaning of this event. I mentioned earlier that interpretation of symbolic transformation, as it is formulated in classical psychoanalysis, requires the intervention of a master scenario and 'a rationalised theoretical language' (Obeyesekere 1990:22), for the patient on his own is unable to uncover the symbolic background of a symptom he suffers from. It is only the analyst, not the patient, who knows the language and the scenario. Only this literate analyst can navigate critically the regression to the primal scene, be it a fear of death or a fear of castration, and the progression back to the symbol in order to uncover the dynamics of symbolic remove between the symptom and its hidden origin. In the Orochon case, an individual ningma narrative, much like a patient who suffers the effects of a trauma, is unable to explain the symbols it employs. What an individual story is incapable of doing, however, is successfully achieved in its relationship to the other story. The fury of the shamanic object, incomprehensible on its own, gains a powerful meaning in communication with the frustration of the hunted shaman. If the two stories constitute a single interwoven work in which one story anticipates the other, the plot of the work is anchored in a principle of reciprocity. The passion of tagjinU the violent anger, of the vengeful carving becomes an extension of the anger of the desperate black shaman. And the three deaths caused by the carving's fury become retributive acts of the three threats of death the black shaman was subject to. The carving's anger relapses into the hunter's repeated violence against its maker and advances towards 45</page><page sequence="14">a rectification of this injustice by reciprocating the violence in the form of sickness and accidents. In this way, the memory of the Great Purge, the ruthless manhunting, extends to the end of the Purge to be crystallised in the image of the rehabilitated object. This theme of retaliation from the prey is not a stranger to the Orochon; it is in fact one of the leitmotiv in Orochon narrative art. In my previous analysis of Orochon hunting narratives (Kwon 1998), I focused on what is hidden in their daily accounts of hunting. I described how Orochon hunters systematically and skilfully eliminate the events of violent predatory killing from their daily hunting stories, and explained this phenomenon in relation to the idea of reciprocal violence: the idea that to represent the predatory violence is a dangerous act as it may provoke a retaliation from the prey in the form of sickness or misfortune. The dialogical relationship I proposed between ningma stories draws upon this idea of reciprocal violence between prey and predator and employs it as an interpretative strategy for the memory of the Purge. This relationship then appears to be functionally equivalent to the patient-analyst relationship in psychoanalysis. Within the relationship, each ningma story conveys mysterious things, but in doing so, explains the mystery conveyed by the other story. There are two fantastic elements in the above ningma stories. Furious Object is Active not necessarily in the sense that the idea of an angry wood carving is rationally inconceivable, but because this idea goes against the cultural 'truth': the fact that the carving's anger was an actively controlled passion to serve for the benefit of society in the Orochon ritual convention. Likewise, the immortality of the black shaman in Believe It or Not is fiction, for most Orochon shamans were successfully eliminated in actuality. The hunter hunts down the black shaman, being faithful to Stalin's call, but fails repeatedly to eliminate this man. The shamanic object is restored in response to the demands of Stalin's critics, but again, it is restored in a manner unknown to the ancient ritual. The amulets become furious not to protect their keepers but to destroy them. In the hands of the ningma myths, the meaning of the ancient curing ritual is distorted to its very opposite. Yet, through this inversion of meaning between ritual and myth (Novik 1984:223-224) and the myth's appropriation of historical facts, the history of Purge loses its foreign origin and is thoroughly assimilated as a domestic affair. In the relational world of ningma, the Purge is no longer an uncontrollable whirlwind of history that determined the fate of many peoples and a countless number of individuals. It is only a drama of indigenous hunting, a very tragic one it may be, that takes place in the separate coactivity of men's predation and women's divination. The elementary structure of Orochon hunting - the conjugal relationship - domesticates the history of Purge and offers no place in it for either No. 1 's brain or a generalised mass hysteria. The Great Purge, the violent war against the past, hastened to obliterate its enemies; yet, in doing so, it also let itself mercilessly assimilated to the secret drama staged by its dead enemies. True, the Orochon ningma lie about the history. The black shaman couldn't have survived the three accurate shots of arrow. To harm the woman's family in such a brutal way is simply not true to the sewe's traditional roles. To be Active in this context still means to be historically untrue, but no longer according to the history dictated by the outside world. 46</page><page sequence="15">The narrative analysis presented so far has been pursued in the general spirit of 'the memory work' (Lambek 1996:xv): the idea that remembering is a necessarily culturally mediated act. That historical representations require cultural mediation is crystallised in the idea of ritual memory. This important lesson, however, should not obscure the fact that certain violent and catastrophic events of the past may impose formidable obstacles upon culture's memory work. This essay is written in a particular spirit of asserting that these obstacles are not impossible to cross as well as showing that crossing the obstacles against mediation is also a culturally mediated act. Historians debate whether the true reality of historical events such as the Purge is knowable; yet, it is a different question whether historical reconstruction can transparently lead us to an understanding of the impact and the meaning of the historical event in a society. If the Orochon are generally silent about the history, it is my belief that their silence should be taken into consideration as an active understanding of the historical background. The ethnographic relevance of Stalin's Great Purge in today's Siberia goes beyond the question of what exactly happened or what it did to its peoples and their societies. The relevance equally comes from what people do with it, and these people may not only remember it but also may have to dismember the memory in their specific ways. To keep these specific ways of remembering, rather than the act of remembering itself, may be a more effective struggle against the legacies of totalitarian violence. Notes * Fieldwork among the Orochon was conducted primarily in 1989-91.1 thank among others Mattijs van de Port, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Keith Hart, Michael Lambek, Steve Tilley, Seth Kunin, and the anonymous referees for their comments. 1. According to Esbenshade, this type of narrative belongs to what he calls the 'Konrad paradigm', named after a popular Hungarian writer whose works are 'a veritable exercise in self accusation and shared responsibility' (Esbenshade 1995:76-77). Esbenshade contrasts this 'Konrad paradigm' to the 'Kundera paradigm' ; the dominant discourse of memory-as-resistance in East-Central Europe. 2. The period of ezhovshchina when Nikolai Ezhov was in charge of the NKVD, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, before he himself fell victim to the purge (Conquest 1968; 1993:208-209). 3. 'Iz t'ymy k svetu', Sovetskii Sakhalin (November 21, 1957); Tarn, gde tsaril shaman', Sovetskii Sakhalin (December 5, 1959); see also Val'diu (1984). 4. The idea of 'black shaman' is not entirely an invention of the Purge. The symbolism of 'black' and 'white' is integral to Siberian shamanism and constitutive of a wider dualist or bipartitioned indigenous worldview. Eliade argues that this colour contrast has (traditionally) no clear moral implications of evil and good (Eliade 1964:186-188). In a dualist system, in any case, you cannot choose only one side without abandoning the whole system. The dual identity of 'black' and 'white', for the Orochon, is manifested in the shaman's costume, made of a mosaic of dark and white colour animal skins, and his seweki, a white and dark pair of spirit reindeer. 5. If Furious Object is based on this historical fact, the narrator and the absent hunter in the story will have the pundadu-nadakta (brother-sister) relationship. This relationship between a married woman and her agnatic brothers played a pivotal role in many Orochon mythic narratives and 47</page><page sequence="16">ritual activities. Several critics raised the point that the narrative analysis in this essay does not consider the actual contexts of storytelling and the identities of the narrators. In retrospect, the absence of contextual description in the analysis was unintentional. I am very curious to know how my intention to contextualise - meaning 'put together' in Latin - separate oral data resulted in quoting them 'out of context'. The uneasy relationship between the contexture and the contexts of narrative acts is indeed an intriguing topic. 6. Stalin's early childhood name was Soso, whose reality he later chose to purge by suppressing it from his biography and also by eliminating people who knew and remembered it (Radzinsky 1996:29^14). It is of course a pure coincidence that soso in Orochon refers to nameless spirits including spirits of dead children. One retired Orochon hunter, however, refused to believe that this was a mere coincidence when we spoke about it in 1997. 7. Michael Lambek (personal communication) raised the important point that the set of three repeated acts is very typical of tales worldwide and questioned whether this can be taken as an element of structural similarity. Three repeated acts are also well demonstrated in the Orochon ritual tradition such as the bear festival. One thing I can add is that in this ritual hunting of the captive bears, traditionally the most prominent collective ritual of the Orochon, it was taboo to fail to kill the prey after three successive attempts. This failure was believed to signify collective calamities. The ritual bear and the shaman mirror each other in Siberian religious symbolism (Ingold 1986: 265), and the Orochon apparently held their last bear festival in 1958, the year when the sewe were collected to the museum.
