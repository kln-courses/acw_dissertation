The superficially obvious candidates have now been eliminated as either present (if in rudimentary form) in other species or less than universal among humans. Lan- guage remains a strong candidate but is better construed as itself an expression of the more fundamentally unique factor which, among its other consequences, facilitated linguistic evolution. Most authorities would, however, agree that there is something unique about us as self- evident as it is difficult to specify. Current explanations of human uniqueness fall into two broad categories: those that deny that it is anything but quantitative (see, e.g., the arguments of many sociobiologists) and those that invoke a qualitative jump to a capacity for symbol- ism (see, e.g., White 1949, Fluehr-Lobban 1986, Kita- hara-Frisch 1980) or the adoption of a life-style based on labour (see, e.g., Engels 1972 [1876]). The problem with accounts of the second type is that they generally do not explain how or why the transition was achieved. In more recent accounts (e.g., Tobias 1983, Blumenberg 1983), this gap is somewhat obscured by the ubiquitous invoca- tion of "feedback loops" of some kind--a strategy which may prevent us from exploring alternative modes of the- oretical analysis. In this paper a model (at this stage rather formal) of hominisation is outlined which accepts that modern humans are unique but has no substantial gaps. An additional feature of this account is that it pro- vides an alternative basis for conceptualising the origin I. ~) 1989 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

HUMAN UNIQUENESS Human uniqueness, it is hypothesized, lies not in any specific item in our behavioural repertoire but in the sheer range of this repertoire, which is open-ended at both species and individual levels. To the psychologist, then, the question is how such a repertoire is possible. Oversimplifying somewhat, all other species possess relatively restricted species-specific behavioural rep- ertoires, and the individual life is structured as a suc- cession of life routines or programmes. (One could epigrammatically summarise this by saying that while non-human animals have life-cycles, humans have biographies.) Of course the animal may, and in higher organisms typically will, learn variations on the imple- mentation of these as required or facilitated by its environment, and, as with the potato washing of Japa- nese macaques (Kawai I965), occasionally new items may enter the repertoire (particularly if environmental factors change radically, as they have for domestically reared chimpanzees in California). A major constraint on non-humans is their mor- phology; their species-specific behavioural repertoires represent the fullest exploitation of the behavioural po- tential of a particular morphotype in a particular en- vironment. In the psychological laboratory we can artificially amplify or alter the expressed repertoire by manipulating environmental variables (usually relating to feeding or threat avoidance), but this does not affect the validity of the basic picture. Novel behaviour in non- humans arises in one of three ways:2 (i) In simple as- sociative stimulus-response learning, a behaviour may happen to be reinforced which, though part of the exist- ing repertoire, has hitherto been embedded as a compo- nent in an extended life routine. This interrupts the routine, and the behaviour, having been conditioned to it, now, as it were, acquires a new significance for the animal in relation to the different life routine which provides the context for its being reinforced. (2) The animal may, like the cats in Thorndike's famous puzzle boxes (I898), simply panic, being in a problem situation for which no solution exists in its repertoire. Panic is randomisation (within fairly tight constraints) of be- haviour. If lucky the animal will, by chance, hit on a satisfactory response, which thereafter enters its reper- toire. (3) In higher mammals at least, the animal may arrive at a novel behaviour by cognitive analysis of the problem situation. Commonly termed "insight" learn- ing, this process involves some level of dynamic an- alogic modelling, that is, identification of cause-effect relationships between components of the situation and possible behaviours. This final category includes, for present purposes, normal social learning during matura- tion in primates, in which the behaviour of adults is systematically emulated (Lancaster I975). This categori- sation is not entirely satisfactory, ignoring as it does the subtleties of contemporary learning theory, but for pres- ent purposes it is adequate. I argue that hominisation involved the evolution, from this third type of learning, of a further strategy for behavioural innovation which, borrowing Levi-Strauss's (I966) term, I call "physio- morphic." PHYSIOMORPHIC LEARNING The basis of insight learning is a capacity for imitation (in a fairly broad sense), and higher primates are very good at it; in English, indeed, we use the verb "to ape" as a synonym for it. What follows is an attempt to show how, formally, a highly imitative species can evolve into one with the open-ended behavioural repertoire which characterises modern humans. We can begin by thinking of non-human animal lives as consisting of a sequence of what I have termed life routines: obtaining food, groom- ing, finding or creating shelter, avoiding predators, mating, etc. These life routines themselves comprise sequences or "programmes" of behaviours on the completion of each of which the animal is in a particular state from which it can proceed to the next. This se- quence may be highly genetically programmed, permit- ting little variation, but in higher animals there is con- siderable flexibility, and if the "basic" programme is somehow blocked alternatives are available. (Environ- mental events can always trigger shifts into alternative life routines, the interrupted life routine typically, if not always, being held in abeyance for subsequent comple- tion.) At each point we envisage the animal as trying to reach a particular "completion state," or outcome. In imitation, an animal unable to reach completion-state y using the genetically determined operation x identifies within its environment an instance of another x's result- ing in y and copies this x, adding to its repertoire the behaviours involved in copying this x, which we may term xl. The upshot is that within each life routine a number of alternative xv's becomes accessible at various stages in the routine's behavioural implementation where blockage of the basic programme has occurred and been overcome. At this stage, however, such xn's be- come available only when the animal is at that specific point in that specific life routine. Operations are tagged to, conditioned on, associated with the motivational state characteristic of that highly specific situation. Envisage, then, a hominid species sharing the primate propensity for imitation but also possessing the extraor- dinarily versatile morphology which arises from bipedal- ism (facilitating all kinds of postural modelling) and in- 2. Many learning theorists would claim that there is really only one, occurring at different levels of complexity. Thorpe (i963) identified six types of learning: habituation, classical conditioning, operant conditioning, latent leaming, insight leaming, and im- printing. Of these, only the conditioning and insight categories directly generate novel behaviour. In this framework "panic" oc- curs in an instrumental-conditioning context, while what I have termed associative stimulus-response leaming covers both classi- cal and most instrumental leaming.</page><page sequence="3">246 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY creasingly dextrous hands, legacies from evolutionary processes the precise nature of which is still under de- bate. This morphology has a greatly enhanced be- havioural potential, a potential explored (though as yet only incidentally) by increasing the number of imita- tively derived alternatives for enacting life routines. Dean Falk has suggested (personal communication) an analogy with the situation which occurs in macroevolu- tion when access to an entirely new niche (e.g., land dwelling) is achieved, this often being followed by a rapid adaptive radiation of life-forms within that niche. The peculiarly versatile novel hominid morphology may similarly have led not to adaptive radiation of life-forms but to adaptive proliferation of behaviours. One aspect of this of course is the focussing of increased neuro-cortical resources on elaboration of manual behaviour, facil- itated, as I have argued elsewhere [Richards I986], by the enslavement of the feet; another may be hairless- ness, eventually allowing the modification of the appear- ance by pigmentation, ornamentation, and clothing. The bipedal upright posture itself may be construed as being at one end of a continuum of postures and locomotive modes-snaking on one's stomach along the ground be- ing at the other end and some swimming facility also probably being present, as in a number of extant shore- dwelling primate species (Ellis i987). The central mech- anism by which such new behaviours enter the reper- toire is imitative modelling, in the broadest sense, of environmental phenomena, which includes, for ex- ample, co-option of the cutting properties of broken stone by incorporating the broken stone into one's own physiology by holding it. The proportion of behaviour originating in this source increases by contrast with that which is "wired in," species-specific in character. The structure of life none- theless remains a chaining of life routines under genet- ically programmed control. As the imitatively derived behaviours (represented by schemata of the form "x causes y") proliferate, however, the way in which they are stored becomes less and less satisfactory; where large numbers of discrete items are embedded in discrete life routines, multiple storage of those used in more than one life routine will place unprecedented representa- tional demands on the behavioural memory store. It will relieve the pressure on energetically expensive neuro- cortical resources to reorganise the system. Instead of tagging imitatively derived schemata to life routines, it is simpler to reverse the process and tag life routines to schemata. This manoeuvre marks a profound change in the nature of the hominid's relationship to its environ- ment not readily apparent from the very abstract terms of the discussion up to this point; imitatively derived schemata are located in the environment, whereas life routines are internal. For example, whereas a "find big leaves" procedure is part of a shelter-construction routine, an optional "gather for shelter" routine may now be triggered by seeing some big leaves; whereas "break cobble for bone-cracking" is part of the food- processing routine, "save for food processing" occurs on finding a suitable cobble (consider Potts's [I984] model of early hominid scavenging using stone-tool caches); whereas "find empty gourd for water carrying" occurs when water is needed, "keep for carrying water" is enacted on encountering an appropriately shaped gourd. That is, fundamentally, instead of the environmental phenomena's being given meanings in terms of the or- ganism's motivational states, the organism's motiva- tional states are given meanings in terms of environ- mental phenomena. "Shelter means leaves" reverses to "leaves mean shelter," "water carrying means gourds" to "gourds mean water carrying," and so on. Once the number of schemata in the repertoire exceeds the num- ber of life routines, such a reversal becomes the more efficient way of storage. The importance of this cannot be overstressed; it represents a radical reversal of the way in which all animals have hitherto related to their worlds but one which has arisen purely in the course of simplifying information storage and, neurologically speaking, may be relatively simply achieved in the course of optimising cortical energy resources. We have now arrived at the third stage in what I see as a five-stage process: following the "normal" imitative primate stage of ad hoc imitatively derived behavioural units embedded in life routines and the stage of a much greater range of such behaviours still embedded in life routines and generating progressive strain on neurolog- ical resources, Stage 3 is a reorganisation in which life routines are tagged to behaviours, storage of which is ultimately environmental. This situation is extremely difficult to picture, since it has no obvious current counterpart. We are perhaps trying to capture here the moment of a "catastrophe" in the mathematical sense, a flip from one state to another as a result of what at first sight appears to be no more than a relatively straightfor- ward step in cognitive evolution. A hominid living in this mode will be experiencing the environment as a (still by our standards restricted) catalogue of instruc- tions-big leaves are read as "gather for shelter if you haven't already." There is no need to wait for the "leaf- gathering" moment in the routine or to represent the leaves in detail internally. The satisfactory enactment of life routines is ensured by embedding them, so to speak, in the environment itself so that they all remain con- tinually accessible instead of chaining consecutively. Another way of envisaging this situation might be. to compare it to the invention of writing. Writing al- leviated the pressure on verbal memory by allowing ver- bal information to be stored externally, to be accessed as required. The process I am proposing here constitutes an analogous move with regard to the behavioural reper- toire itself; the external world (including, of course, other hominids) becomes a "library" of behavioural modes and existential properties. Just as writing even- tually rendered extended verbal rote memory redundant, so this reversal of the previous relationship between be- haviours and life routines renders redundant elaborated behavioural memory for all variations of enacting every stage of every life routine. The old life routines do still provide the basic life structure for the species and its individual members. Although the behavioural reper-</page><page sequence="4">Volume 3o, Number 2, April I989 I 247 toire can expand more than before, the life routines, if not morphology, continue to constrain it. One is bound, though, at this point to face the difficult question, "During which life routine is all this supposed to be going on?" Three possibilities suggest themselves: i. One of the few aspects of the behaviour of early hominids on which there is something resembling con- sensus is scavenging-gathering. Perhaps, then, we can infer that the already relatively flexible scavenging- gathering routine of environmental exploration provided the context in which a reorganisation of life routines from sequential chaining into nesting within a single (diurnal?) life routine of environmental ranging was pos- sible. 2. During the juvenile phase of primate life, fairly unstructured responsiveness to and exploration of the environment (both individual and collective) already oc- cur in the form of play; juveniles are more likely be- havioural innovators than adults. An extension of this phase, widely ascribed to early hominids, could thus am- plify this tendency. While this could account for Stage 2 amplifications of the behavioural repertoire, its relation- ship to the organisational restructuring of Stage 3 is more obscure. 3. Ecological studies of many species show them spending a lot of time apparently doing nothing. Bekoff and Wells (I986) report coyotes as spending 54.7% of their time "resting" in winter, and Schaller (i964) de- scribes the mid-morning-to-mid-afternoon phase of the gorilla day as "siesta time," at least for adults, infants playing during this period. It is possible that this could have become "filled in" more actively, particularly in the light of the theoretical work now being under- taken by Wheeler (I984, i985, i987) on the context in which bipedalism, hairlessness, and brain enlargement emerged. A central consequence of hairless bipedalism is a reduction of ambient heat exposure in hominids dur- ing the midday period when other mammals are least active, opening up a new scavenging/predation niche. Alternatively, the aquaticist scenario (Morgan i982) is of an insular primate population suffering severe re- source depletion and having to alter its life-style in order to survive, offering selective advantage to individuals able to override genetically governed behavioural pro- grammes. As far as Stage 3 changes are concerned, the first of these possibilities seems the most directly promising as providing a context for reversing the direction in which life routines and imitatively derived schemata are coupled. Even so, there is no possibility yet of doing something other than furthering a basic life routine. What has happened is that the enactment of basic life routines can become more fragmented and more inter- twined. One crucial innovation here, as Linton (I97I) has ar- gued, may be carrying technology. A technique for carry- ing is significant for the present argument because it does not relate specifically to a particular life routine but can be involved in implementing several, for example, feeding (transporting food), tool use (carrying tools or the raw materials for their manufacture), and caretaking of infants (carrying them, perhaps in suckling position). In short, "carrying" is a generalised behaviour of precisely the kind required to break down the sequentially chained character of life-routine enactment. The objects in the environment which "mean carrying" (large leaves, gourds, vines, etc.) act as a synchronous focus for several life routines, and carrying itself facilitates, in- deed entails, the temporal extension of life-routine enactment. If humans are "time-binders," carrying tech- nology constitutes a prototypical example of time- binding activity. "Consciousness of time" is a long- established item on the list of candidates for what makes humans unique. Ingold (i986:48) points out how this was central to Darwin's account of the evolutionary emergence of human moral awareness and cites a reiter- ation of this by Whitrow (I975:35); man "is distin- guished from all other animals by his sense of past and future." From the present perspective, consciousness of time would, then, appear to be a consequence of the emergence of a Stage 3 life-style. The fourth stage takes things a decisive step farther, one which follows inevitably insofar as behavioural amplification and intensity of relationship with the en- vironment must again create strains for the behaviour- life-routine connection. As behavioural diversity and complexity increase, the "detours" involved in enacting life routines become lengthier and more convoluted and their enactments increasingly intertwined. In this fourth stage the situation can again be dramatically simplified by abandoning direct life-routine tagging altogether. We now have a mode of learning, of behavioural ampli- fication, based on the simple rule "For any outcome identify an operation that yields it and copy." Life-rou- tine tagging as an essential aspect of acquiring new be- haviour becomes obsolete once this radically generalised solution has been recognised. But there is no way in which a transition from Stage 2 to Stage 4 can take place directly; Stage 3 is a logically necessary intermediate phase. It achieves a preliminary breakdown of the se- quential life-routine structure-erodes the dominance of genetically determined behavioural sequences and re- places these with an increasingly intense, wide-ranging, and active direct involvement with the environment. Only when this latter life mode has become dominant can the final move of abandoning life-routine tagging be safely made. Stage 3 acts, as it were, as a safety net. All that may now remain of a previous life routine is its end state. The programmed sequences of component behaviours become redundant. The individual is re- quired only to know what he or she wants; getting it is simply a matter of knowing what, in the present circum- stances, can bring it about. "What he or she wants" can range from a high-level imperative such as "get food" to a low-level one such as "get grease off hands." Thus even more extended sequences of behaviour are possible, or- ganised directly around environmental phenomena; this move facilitates such extension because behaviour is no longer stored internally. The enactment, that is, of a general imperative such as "get water" can involve a</page><page sequence="5">248 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY whole hierarchy of subordinate behaviours determined by the specific features of the particular situation in which the imperative has arisen (e.g., tying a container to a piece of creeper to lower it into a water hole or over a cliff). Of course, successful innovations will become routinised, and it is in no way being suggested that in everyday life the basic activities of food acquisition, food preparation, shelter provision, and tool making will be met in anything other than a very conservative fashion. Our concern here is with behavioural innovation. Be- havioural innovation is elicited primarily in problem situations. What is being proposed here is that Stage 4 marks the advent of a general problem-solving strategy independent of any particular life routine. What is espe- cially important about this is that the onus is now on the maximisation of the behavioural repertoire as such and the possibility at least of doing something other than enacting a basic life routine, namely, what we would call acquiring knowledge, is thus on the cards. The accumu- lation of imitatively derived schemata by identifying "x causes y" sequences in the environment becomes a gen- eral imperative as it becomes evident that all outcomes are potentially valuable. This situation generates a new kind of strain, that of discriminatively encoding both the more rapidly ex- panding range of environmental phenomena being as- similated into the behavioural repertoire and the be- haviours themselves. It is this which provides the context in which, as a fifth and final stage, fully evolved lexical encoding emerges. For reasons which would take us too far afield to enter into here, it is likely that this must be accompanied by the emergence of syntax (basi- cally in order to enable the differentiation of speaker properties from world properties in a situation in which the former are, as I am arguing, derived from the latter [Richards n.d.]). It would be folly to suppose that one had fully solved the origin-of-language riddle, but in my view the social functions of language could be met by an elab- orate non-lexical, intonational form of sound communi- cation that is now totally integrated into our speech as the intonational "carrier wave" by which we communi- cate the speaker-listener relationship independently of lexical content. Lexical, grammatically structured en- coding overlies this and arose as a response to the situa- tion just described (see Lieberman I984, Richards I987 for recent discussions of the various positions being taken on the origin-of-language issue). The important outcome of Stage 5, in addition to syn- tax, is that knowledge storage again shifts location, from the natural environment to the cultural one-though I must stress that throughout the process I have been de- scribing earlier stages are never entirely abandoned or lost. Just as we can still be classically conditioned or panic, so Stage 3 modes of behaving may covertly per- sist-an example could be gathering driftwood for fire making on a seaside stroll "wood means fuel for fire"). Conversely, anticipations of cultural storage may be- gin to occur on a small scale during Stage 4. It is the shift from Stage 2 to Stage 3 which is the crucial qualita- tive turning point; the other boundaries are far more blurred. Shifts in the location of knowledge storage will, furthermore, be accompanied by changes in the tempo- ral rate of change (Plotkin i987), and the two shifts pos- tulated-from cortical to environmental and from envi- ronmental to cultural/linguistic-may, in Plotkin's scheme, be considered to provide for accelerations in this (accelerations subsequently carried even farther by liter- acy and then modem electronic information technology). IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODEL The kind of learning I am referring to includes all be- haviour in which the organism utilises properties it has identified in the external world (including the behaviour of other members of its social group) for bringing about the outcomes which it has seen to characterise them- the use of broken stones for cutting or sponges for soak- ing up liquid, rinsing to remove dirt, etc. This "phys- iomorphic learning" is the opposite of "anthropomor- phism," and an immediate implication of this model is that it challenges the almost universal assumption of primitive anthropomorphism. Rather than get side- tracked into discussing this issue here, I will merely note in passing that the Danish psychologist Hoffding (i89i) noted the difficulty raised for the doctrine of primitive anthropomorphism by the fact that all our psychological terms are derived from physical-world terms rather than the reverse. (Part of the problem here has been a failure to spot that anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism are in some senses opposites, not synonyms, and both are routinely ascribed to our ancestors quite indiscrimi- nately.) What is being suggested is that the primary epis- temological tactic can be summed up in the instruction "To understand something, be like it." Physiomorphism can take many forms-an obvious one, and the most literal, being eating. The "meaning" of the plant is what happens to you when you eat it. One can surely presume that an omnivorous hominid would have become aware of the intoxicant properties of dagga (Cannabis sativa), native to East Africa, and fermented fruits. Another is wearing. We all know the dramatic changes in our self- image which can be engendered by fancy dress, even wearing a culturally symbolic hat (e.g., a policeman's helmet). How much greater the effect, then, of donning the entire skin of a familiar animal! Behavioural em- ulation is, however, perhaps the most obvious. The cru- cial feature is that the organism augments its behav- ioural repertoire by assuming properties identified in the world around it, ranging from simple physical proper- ties like hardness, sharpness, and wetness to being like a snake, a lion, or even thunder. The model just outlined is an attempt at explaining how physiomorphic learning evolves from being an occasional occurrence into being a dominant hominid learning mode, actively engaged in. This evolutionary process has an air of inevitability about it, the reversal of the organism-environment rela- tionship characteristic of Stage 3 acting like the prover- bial pebble which eventually triggers an avalanche. Whether this is a "progressive" event in any objective sense depends on one's view of the present. It is certainly</page><page sequence="6">Volume 30, Number 2, April I989 1249 not to be understood as mysteriously teleological; each move is determined by such factors as the need to opti- mise neuro-cortical resources or to enhance immediate adaptive efficiency. Positive feedback loops too may well have a place in further analysis of how the almighty acceleration of affairs in the last 2o millennia or so came about, but they need not be invoked to account for the structure of the main story.3 So far little has been said about social organisation. It is in this connection that the physiomorphic model raises some intriguing possibilities. As a species's be- havioural repertoire begins to expand in the way being proposed, behavioural homogeneity begins to break down, and eventually the distinctive species character threatens to evaporate. Nowadays we would find it im- possible to say what behaviour was distinctively human; some of us are peaceful, some violent, some travel, some stay put, some eat meat, some are vegetarian, some live in skyscrapers, some in lake dwellings, and so forth. The behavioural diveristy engendered by physiomorphic learning is thus double-edged. On the one hand, it pro- vides the social group with a far greater behavioural rep- ertoire than ever before; the preferred behavioural modes of group members will vary, and in a problem situation the chances are greatly enhanced that someone will know of a solution. This diversity, however, endangers group coherence, and some kind of group evaluation of behaviours becomes necessary to offset its disruptive consequences. One point at which behavioural heterogeneity may early on begin to affect the structure of social dynamics is the dominance hierarchy. Shafton (I976) notes how successful predation results in "a temporary elevation of rank" among chimpanzees, and Jonker (1987: I6 5) infers from this that "possession of weapons and increased ag- gression would have had a confusing, and even a disrup- tive, influence on the rank order." This argument does, however, imply that early levels of predation were high (and individualistic) and that aggression-enhancing tools were among the earliest in the hominid armoury. On the other hand, any diversification of behaviour could be envisaged as having some disruptive effects on a simple age/sex-based hierarchical structure, since actual be- havioural competences will become increasingly mul- tidimensional, no longer correlating straightforwardly with age and physique. "Temporary elevation of rank" will occur increasingly as the idiosyncratic problem- solving skills of particular group members replace species-specific behaviours. It is tentatively proposed that the advent of culture lies in this need to maintain group coherence in the face of an expanding behavioural repertoire. Species identity alone no longer suffices. An obvious step here will be some prototypic differentiation between nature and culture of the kind familiar to an- thropologists. The individual's identity lies not in his or her idiosyncratic behavioural repertoire or species- specific morphology but in group membership, and it is to the group interest that his or her particular skills, etc., must be subordinated. We may well need to differentiate two levels of "culture" here, the first simply distin- guishing the human group from nature (corresponding perhaps to the original Tylorian notion [see Ingold i986]) and the second distinguishing human groups from one another. This latter would come into play only with sufficient population density for such groups to become aware of each other. These distinctions need not have arisen at the same time, and in fact the likelihood is surely that the former preceded the latter by a consider- able margin. With the advent of language, as already in- dicated, knowledge storage clearly becomes cultural (al- though some rudimentary cultural "enveloping" in Stage 4 is conceded), and once a natural phenomenon has served as the source for behavioural innovation it ac- quires a cultural as well as individual meaning. At a deeper level than this, the very locus of natural selection changes. Hitherto survival has depended on mastery of a species-specific behavioural repertoire- plus such variations as have been hit upon. Now sur- vival depends on acquiring a socially valued set of be- havioural skills. The lame horse, the blind dog, the tiger allergic to meat has no chance; with hominids it is possi- ble for some at least of the morphologically and physio- logically deviant or even handicapped to survive provid- ing they can exploit this feature in a way which has recognised social value. This perspective is curiously the reverse of that adopted by Rindos (i986:326): "As hu- man survival became increasingly tied to survival in the group, the capacity to perform in ways demanded by the group would have become essential to survival and re- production (consider, for example, the likely fitness of a mute hominid during the period when language began to mediate interpersonal relationships)." Leaving aside whether human survival has become increasingly tied to survival in the group (this seems on the face of it doubt- ful; are solitary chimpanzees commoner than solitary humans?), I would emphasise not "the capacity to per- form in ways demanded by the group" but the capacity of the group to accommodate the behavioural diversi- fication of its members. And as far as "mute hominids" are concerned, my argument is that, however low, the likely fitness of such an individual will now be appre- ciably above zero for the first time-interpersonal rela- tionships have never been exclusively mediated lin- guistically, and a mute may now be able to acquire behavioural skills which possess recognised value for the group. This, however, is not so much a question of "capacity to perform in ways demanded by the group" (implying the existence of preset group norms) as one of capacity to convince the group of the value to it of one's performances. More generally, talk of a "capacity for cul- ture" is misleading, since it leaves the concept of "cul- ture" unexamined and implies that it is some qualita- tively novel form of behaviour that has suddenly become within the evolving hominid's range (and from there one is pitched into speculation about its individual adaptive value). From the present perspective it is far less myste- 3. In a sense, the account given above is itself the description of a postulated positive feedback loop between behavioural repertoire size and efficiency of information storage and access.</page><page sequence="7">250 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY rious; it is rooted in the need for social dynamics to respond to increased behavioural diversity among group members. As physiomorphic learning capacities in- crease at the individual level, so will the capacity to complicate social relationships. This may become clearer if we consider animal identifications, which surely played a large part in the amplification of the behavioural repertoire in that ani- mals constitute behavioural models of a highly complex kind. To catch a particular animal, copy the behaviour of that which preys upon it; to resist a predator, copy the behaviour of that which most successfully resists it. The way is thus open for the small and the slow as well as the big and the speedy to carve out social niches for them- selves. (Even the blind and the lame may survive if they are resourceful enough; the blind person's hearing and navigation skills in the dark become valued, the lame person's fire-keeping equally so.) But furthermore, animal behaviour is itself frequently social, and its emu- lation will involve not one but two or more individuals. Behaviourally the fundamental form in which this oc- curs is what we now term "dancing," and, as Lonsdale (I98 i) amply illustrates, the connections between ani- mal behaviour, dance, and the collective structuring of social life absolutely central in all known "cultures."4 Thus, from my point of view, the physiomorphic as- similation of animal behaviour and the elaboration of more complex forms of social structure go hand in hand. Perhaps significant in this general context is the sheer variety of human locomotion and its essentially learned character. Whilst it might be said that humans are oblig- atory bipedal walkers, our gait is highly variable across cultures, and our bipedality itself has to be learned (feral children do not acquire normal bipedality). (This whole topic is reviewed by Devine [i985].) A final point: Although humans are apparently genet- ically fairly homogeneous, we are morphologically among the most polytypic of species, and it is surely possible that this is because behavioural diversity pro- motes morphological diversity. This opens up the possi- bility of our beginning to take some first steps towards understanding the evolutionary origins of personality- an issue which has only rarely even been raised and on which next to no headway has so far been made (but see Brues i962)-though Sheldon's bizarre Atlas of Men (I954) ought not to be entirely ignored. PHYSIOMORPHISM AND EARLY HOMINID BEHAVIOUR To illustrate the potential value of the physiomorphic model, we can consider its relevance to the evidence of Homo habilis behaviour and make some less com- prehensive observations regarding the H. erectus and H. sapiens neanderthalensis evidence. The assumption that H. habilis constitutes a crucial "advance" towards hominisation is deeply engrained in current palaeoanthropological thought; this is, after all, the earliest hominid to be granted membership of the genus Homo. The circumstances of its discovery played a considerable role in this, since it was assumed to have been the maker of the Oldowan stone artefacts by contrast to Zinjanthropus (Australopithecus robustus boisei), whose discovery had immediately preceded it. The identification of a supposed stone circle of the same age at Olduvai site FLK encouraged this view. Tobias in particular has often placed H. habilis in a pivotal role (e.g., Tobias i980) and, along with the often reproduced paintings of Matternes, his interpretations and those of the Leakeys have created a fairly well-articulated picture of the life and times of H. habilis. On closer examination this picture proves to be less secure than the eminence of its advocates would lead one to suppose. Even the identification of the species itself is not settled; there is considerable controversy surrounding the allocation of fossils to the taxon (Stringer i986), and the recent find by Johansen et al. (i987) of a supposed partial skeleton, OH 62, has further muddied the waters in that it appears to have relatively longer arms than A. afarensis. It is not entirely easy to reconcile the morphological and biolog- ical data with the behavioural picture generally painted; on the one hand, a small (ca. I.35i m), perhaps long- armed, relatively short-lived creature with a brain size of 659 cm3, on the other a protolanguage-using, wall- building, tool-making, probably monogamous, home- base-using mini-human (Falk I980, Isaac I983, Lovejoy I98I, Tobias I980). It is important, though, that we get the level of hominid behavioural sophistication at around 2,000,000 years correct, because our picture of this "base-line" will affect our perception of all subsequent events. Leaving aside the credibility of the taxon H. habilis as such and accepting that whatever non-fossil evidence of hominid behaviour there is was produced by a species something like that represented by the fossils so classified, what is the minimum level of hominisation required to account for the data? The data on H. habilis behaviour are of three kinds: (i) morphological, in particular, the presence of incipient brain asymmetry of the "modern" kind, notably the en- larged left frontal region; (2) artefactual, in which I in- clude not only stone tools and the "stone wall" at FLK but the extensive studies (by Kelley and Toth, Shipman, Potts, Bunn, and others) of cut marks on bone and tool- wear polishes; and (3) theoretical work on topics such as early hominid bioenergetics, primarily by Wheeler (i984, i985, I987), tool-cache distribution (Potts i984), and ecology (Hill i982; Blumenschine I98 6a, b). I would argue that there is nothing here requiring us to postulate capacities beyond those characteristic of Stage 3. The relatively greater brain size of habilines compared with australopithecines is consistent with the notion that an enlarged behavioural repertoire is requiring greater infor- mation storage, but to argue from the presence of rudimentary H. sapiens-like asymmetry and "speech"- 4. Williams (i980) denies that imitation of animal behaviour is involved in the origins of dancing, emphasizing what he considers the uniquely human sense of rhythm, but if we view rhythm as providing form and animal behaviour content there is surely no necessary contradiction here.</page><page sequence="8">Volume 3o, Number 2, April I989 1 25I area enlargement to possession of language in any mod- em sense is surely going beyond the evidence. At most we can postulate a greater use of the sound channel and perhaps vocal mimicry (by analogy, indeed, with appar- ently similar forms of asymmetry in mimicking birds [Nottebohm I9771) and some measure of handedness. From Chase and Dibble's recent review (i987) it is appar- ent that there are really no grounds at all for ascribing to hominids this early anything remotely resembling cul- ture in either of the senses mentioned above-a view Binford has also recently reendorsed (Renfrew i987). The stone tools, according to Wynn (I98I), imply no higher intellectual level than that possessed by the orang-utan, although Chase and Dibble consider that he has somewhat exaggerated this point by being overselec- tive in the material examined. Gowlett (i984) also ar- gues, against Wynn, that even with regard to Oldowan tools "we can be certain . .. that the task required very considerable abilities: of manipulation, concentration, planning and of 'visual imaging"' (p. I77), as well as pro- viding us with a flow diagram of the "procedural tem- plate" of their manufacture. What he fails to perceive is that once an artefact of desirable design has been in- vented, its subsequent reproduction is purely a matter of copying. The innovation, once in existence, provides a physical, visible external "template" for subsequent manufacturers. Given the vast number of artefacts often reported for both Oldowan and Acheulian sites, "inter- nal templates" and "visualizing" seem redundant postu- lates; there would generally have been a real one around to copy. The manipulation, concentration, and planning involved in making an Oldowan tool appear, prima facie, far less than those involved in making many bird nests. Wynn argues that the typology adopted for classifying Oldowan tools is largely illusory, having been imposed by archaeologists on assemblages rather than correspond- ing to anything in the minds of their makers. If, how- ever, we do find standardisation of form, as in Acheulian handaxes, what does this prove? High standardisation might be taken as much as evidence for a high level of genetic control (as, indeed, with bird nests) as for a ca- pacity for visual abstraction, and after all it is high varia- tion in form that we take to be one of the hallmarks of "culture," since it seems to imply the operation of highly labile, autonomous traditions. One cannot have it both ways; on balance, standardisation indicates auto- matisation of manufacture, and that might even imply genetic control. At any rate, surrounded by stone tools and witnessing their manufacture from its earliest years, the individual H. habilis or H. erectus tool maker would have been utilising a totally routinised behavioural se- quence involving no more planning, concentration, or visualising capacity and probably less digital dexterity than tying one's shoelaces. Sussman's (I988) recent rein- terpretation of the tool-making abilities of Paranthropus must lend support to this view. The cut-mark evidence has established that scaveng- ing was taking place, and clearly some degree of curation was occurring in relation to stone tools. Potts's (I984) model of this is, I think, ingenious and, if correct, sug- gests that behaviour was being planned over extended time periods. His scepticism about the identification of FLK as a living floor seems sound. Blumenschine (i986a) has argued on energetic grounds that the most likely scavenging mode for Plio/Pleistocene hominids is "routed foraging," in which the group daily travels be- tween sleeping sites foraging as it goes, as opposed to the more socially complex "central-place foraging" from a home base favoured by Isaac. This routed foraging would occur in riparian woodlands (see also Shipman i986), predominantly during the dry season, rather than the open savannah. Open-savannah foraging, if it occurred, would, however, more resemble central-place foraging, involving the whole group (not just males) during food bonanzas. Potts's tool-cache model might be more con- gruent with Blumenschine's scenario than with Isaac's if the foraging route became a well-established one. On the other hand, a scenario in which Plio/Pleistocene homi- nids were predominantly riparian forest-dwellers is rather at odds with the received wisdom that their bipedalism was in some way a response to life in the open savannah. Wheeler's hypothesis suggests that a midday scaveng- ing niche was also opened up by bipedalism, which would facilitate open-savannah scavenging at a time when most savannah fauna were resting; this would clearly heighten the pressure on the hyaenids, whose decline coincides with the advent of tool-using Plio/ Pleistocene hominids (seven large species having be- come extinct since this time, as Blumenschine [I986a] points out). It is, however, extremely difficult to get the daily life of H. habilis in perspective on the basis of such data, since it was subject to diachronic change both sea- sonally (Blumenschine I986a, Shipman i986) and pre- sumably over the lifetime of the species as a whole. As far as the latter is concerned, the scantiness of the ar- chaeological data and the range of uncertainties in dat- ing are such that we cannot assume that all our data necessarily sample the same form of social organisation. Recent literature does nevertheless appear to be in the general direction of demoting rather than promoting tool-using Plio/Pleistocene hominids as far as resem- blance to modern humans is concerned. Habilines, then, are most likely to have been forager- scavengers, without a home base, capable of transporting both food and crude stone tools (and possibly curating the latter), not particularly dimorphic in food acquisi- tion and tool use but having a sound-signalling system somewhat more advanced than that of any extant pri- mate. The habilines' geographical range is not clear, as some South African specimens are sometimes assigned to the taxon (though Stringer [I986] excludes them on balance), but appears to be restricted at most to East Africa and possibly only to Tanzania/Kenya. This sug- gests that they were operating in a fairly specific envi- ronment to which they had evolved a particular adaptive behavioural relationship. They are also present for a rather short period of time before being replaced by H. erectus. My view is that we should consider them ad- vanced exponents of a Stage 2 species-specific life-style,</page><page sequence="9">2521 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY as small, relatively hairless bipeds capable of handling the midday temperatures and exploiting this temporal scavenging niche by simple butchery sufficient to dis- member cadavers for curation and for marrow and head- content extraction (Blumenschine i986b) and occasion- ally transporting food from open savannah back to woodland. That they also had a flair for waving sticks about need not be disputed. By the time at which FLK and our other restricted evidence were generated, they may well have begun the transition to Stage 3, which would have provided the dynamic for a more rapid diversification and expansion of their behavioural reper- toire culminating in the emergence of H. erectus as the Stage 3 hominid. The new midday niche would have been a genuinely novel "life-space" for which no life routines existed. It would have provided an ideal situa- tion for the expansion of the imitatively derived be- havioural repertoire characteristic of Stage 2 and the es- tablishment of rudimentary "time-binding" in the form of carrying, tool-cache accumulation, and expansion of foraging to incorporate "useful" objects as well as food. The increased complexity of life-routine completion that this entailed was precisely the kind of pressure which would have led to Stage 3. On balance I would argue that this transition occurred during the late H. habilis phase. In that sense Tobias, Leakey (I979), and others are correct in assigning the species a pivotal role. On the other hand, the level of "humanity" at which habilines were operating when this happened would have been far lower than is generally thought: spe- cifically, I would argue (particularly in view of the ba- sicranium reconstructions of Laitman and Heimbuch [i982] that they did not have language in any modern sense, that they did not forage from home bases in a socially structured, sexually dimorphic fashion, and that they were devoid of "culture" of any kind. The enigmatic features of H. erectus behaviour-the very slow rate of technological change coupled with the high level of environmental adaptability facilitating a radiation out of Africa across the Eurasian landmass, the homogeneity of lithic technology and virtual absence of any evidence of culture (see Chase and Dibble i987) coupled with brain and general morphology verging on the modern-will perhaps now fall more clearly into place if viewed as products of a Stage 3 hominid. If the physiomorphic model is correct, this situation is in many respects precisely what we would expect; be- haviour continues to be embedded within species- specific life routines even although the actual enact- ment of these can be tailored very finely to specific environmental settings. There is as yet no "cultural" mediation of the natural environment or demarcation of the human; thus the whole mode of relating to the envi- ronment will, in one sense, be a passive and conservative one, behavioural innovation occurring only when specific needs arise. The H. erectus radiation was, in terms of movement per generation, likely to have been slow; transitions between environments would have been gradual, enabling a gradual modification of com- plex behaviour routines. Whether in their later days they mastered fire is uncertain, but I am sympathic with Bin- ford's usual scepticism about the overinterpretation of H. erectus sites, especially Zhoukoudian (Binford and Ho i985 ).5 A Stage 3 classification would account for the majority of the currently available data on H. erectus behaviour. Did they have modem-type language? No, but a probably versatile vocal signalling system used primarily in social relationships and warning. Did they have "culture"? Not in any significant sense. Were they "self-conscious"? In the sense that other primates are, yes (Suarez and Gallup i98i), but not "reflexive." We cannot, I think, attribute to them anything resembling a modern human "psychology"; they still had life-cycles rather than biographies (though the passage to China must, on occasion, have given the brightest of them cause to stop and wonder!). Whatever the merits of his controversial theoretical position, Jaynes (1976) has made a persuasive case for the relative unimportance of reflexive self-consciousness for many behaviours rou- tinely considered to implicate it. Oakley (i98i) must now be considered to have been speculating well beyond the evidence in his interpreta- tion of the data on early ochre use and incorporation of fossil "blazons" into Acheulian handaxes. Given the many thousands of Acheulian handaxes now known, the likelihood that two or three would incorporate a fossil purely by chance must be fairly high, while there is no positive evidence of ochre use at the Gadeb site, as a passage he cites from the Clark and Kurashina (1979:36) report explicitly says ("None of the pieces show unques- tionable evidence of rubbing, but the possibility should not be ignored"). There is a lot of difference between "not ignoring" the possibility of ochre rubbing and using it as grounds for writing, "Unendowed with natural or- namentation apart from the glories of head hair, man may well have turned to artificial colouring of his skin and apparel as soon as tribes, moieties and family groups were formed and required to be distinguished at a dis- tance" (p. 207). It is only at the end of the H. erectus phase, around 5oo,ooo-25o,ooo years, that the symptoms of a transi- tion to Stage 4 begin to appear. The Neanderthals possi- bly represent the highest form of Stage 4; certainly cul- ture in the sense of demarcation of the human from the "natural," if not in the sense of demarcation betwee-n human groups, seems to be present, along with a far more complex technology, evidence (if scanty) of "non- functional" activity in the form of ornamentation and pigmentation, and evidence of awareness of and re- sponse to death (although Chase and Dibble I987 sug- gest that this is not so strong as is often supposed). Ar- chaic H. sapiens is also known to have built shelters, used fire, and made spears (de Lumley I969; Oakley et al. 1977), and Neanderthals did likewise. In general the 5. The methodological problems involved in evaluating potential fire sites are formidable, and judgment should surely still be re- served, especially on pre-million-year dates, of which Chesowanja at I.4S million years is, according to Barbetti (I987), the most promising.</page><page sequence="10">Volume 30, Number 2, April I989 1 253 period preceding the widespread appearance of H. sa- piens sapiens about 40,000 years ago is marked by in- creasing artefact variation in terms of both tool-kit size and composition and "cultural" or stylistic differences between geographical regions (although the precise in- terpretation of this is notoriously controversial). This heightened tempo of change coupled with behavioural diversification of a new order suggesting some "pro- tocultural" level of social life strongly suggests that Stage 3 has been surpassed and the more active explora- tion of behavioural potential via conscious physiomor- phic learning, typifying Stage 4, has emerged. It perhaps needs stressing here that psychological and physical evo- lution (at least as knowable from the fossil record) are not necessarily coupled and that the revised Qafzeh dat- ing of ca. go,ooo years strengthens considerably the dat- ing of anatomically modern H. sapiens to ca. IOO,OOO years (Valladas et al. i988) while the advent of psycho- logically modern H. sapiens has not yet been pushed back farther than ca. 40,000 years. It is clearly possible that the crucial biological changes were at the soft-tissue level, leaving no fossil trace. Stage 5, as stated earlier, does not, however, finally make its appearance until the achievement of lexical, syntactically structured lan- guage by psychologically (as opposed to anatomically) modern H. sapiens sapiens, which I would follow Lieber- man in placing at around 40,000 years. Although only a rough outline has been provided here of the way in which the five-stage model of the evolu- tion of physiomorphic learning correlates with the major phases of hominid evolution, it may be enough to indi- cate how it can provide a framework in which to inter- pret the often enigmatic evidence for early hominid be- haviour. It might also provide a basis from which to generate more narrow-range hypotheses about the na- ture of that behaviour which do not rely on analogies to extant primate or tribal-society evidence. Of course, it would be necessary to integrate this with theories about social organisation in relation to sexual behaviour such as those of Turke (i 984) and Manson (i 986), which focus on the sexual politics of menstruation, concealed ovula- tion, and male meat provisioning. Finally, if this se- quence is correct, it will allow us to defend ourselves more systematically against anachronism in the paint- ing of prehistoric scenarios. A talking H. habilis will perhaps become as obviously out of place as Robin Hood's lighting a cigarette. CONCLUSION Finally, I perhaps ought also to say briefly how this ap- proach relates to that of writers such as Parker and Gib- son (I979) and Wynn (I98I, i982), who have been tack- ling the evolution of intelligence in a broadly Piagetian framework. The physiomorphic model may be seen as complementary to theirs; they are concerned with the increasing formal logical complexity of the behavioural operations in our repertoire; I am attempting a more general account of the kind of orientation of organism to environment which facilitates this increase. The evolu- tion of "intelligence" is not simply a matter of increas- ing complexity in cognitive operations, since these have to be understood in the context of a process which has as its final outcome a species with an open-ended be- havioural repertoire and no behaviourally definable "species identity." So viewed, we can see growing cogni- tive sophistication as enhancing the identification and analysis of the environmental phenomena which, it has been argued here, serve as the source for behavioural innovation. But these novel cognitive operations them- selves are initially (and insofar as they leave any perma- nent record) concrete in form, being behavioural repli- cations of environmental phenomena. Only when an environmentally identifiable embodiment of a "cognitive schema" is available can it be said to have reality, and prior to any such identification it cannot be said to exist at all. The basic virtue claimed for the model is that it pro- vides plausible accounts of the underlying nature of hu- man uniqueness and the emergence of culture which require neither the sudden appearance of a new faculty, an impenetrable tangle of feedback loops, nor a prioristic exercises in genetic theory which leave problematical central concepts unexamined. It also-and this is an in- evitable dimension of human evolutionary theorising, as Pilbeam (i980) and others have long recognized- provides a sort of creation myth consistent with our present predicament. We have no specific human na- ture; we are internalised nature. We have outflanked all ecological checks on us by our ability to set nature's properties against one another. The only phenomenon which may yet master us is fire-for surely, from the time when our ancestors began gazing half-hypnotised into the campfire, feeding it twigs, to the latest weapons negotiations, we have never been entirely sure whether we control the fire or the fire controls us.
