<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 29, Number 4, October 1992 TAKING EVOLUTION SERIOUSLY Maxine Sheets-Johnstone JC/XCEPT insofar as theory is concerned, philosophers tend to place evolution at an exclusively scientific address. In practice this means they divorce historical significances of evolution from their particular theoretical concerns?from axiomatic formulations de? rived from population genetics or molecular biology, for example?and subsequently ig? nore them. The overall effect of standard practice is not only to overlook the vast tem? poral span and diversity of life preceding the immediate human present, but to disregard the more intimately related science of pale oanthropology. Where, for example, do we read of primordial language, ancestral homi nid tool-making, burial practices, or cave paintings in the context of philosophical in? vestigations of human language, cognition, or art? Even in the philosophy of science, philosophers uniformly bypass pale oanthropology, most often in favor of either a neurophysiology whose centerfold fea? tures the brain and its circuitry, or an an? orexic biology whose living flesh is so emaciated as to be virtually absent. The stan? dard philosophic practice is well exemplified by Michael Ruse in his The Philosophy of Biology, a book devoted to showing that the theory of evolution is not dissimilar from theories in the physical sciences, and that the single discipline of population genetics (re? ducible ultimately to molecular biology) stands at the explanatory center of evolu? tionary theory. Ruse mentions the historical side of evolution but only to argue away its centrality to evolutionary theory. Linking paleontology to what is dead and long gone?to bare fossils and little more?he in fact calls evolution with its historical aspect intact an "old concept," and refers to "the supposedly historical nature of organic phe? nomena."1 For Ruse, as for many philoso? phers,2 molecular genetics alone offers a bona fide philosophical basis for examining and understanding evolutionary theory. Standard philosophic practice is equally well exemplified by the ongoing, complex "unit of selection" controversy.3 The ques? tion of the level(s) at which selection acts and of whether there is a "true unit of selec? tion"4 is not without interest?either to biol? ogists or to philosophers. Neither was the question of fitness which occupied center stage several years back.5 However, when such questions are taken as paradigmatic of the type of question of proper concern to philosophers of biology, then not only are concerns about concrete historical processes of evolution, including human evolution, no? where in evidence, but the total absence of these historical concerns from philosophical discussion strongly suggests that they are not properly the province of philosophers at all but only of biologists. In other words, with respect to actual evolutionary processes that have taken place, the attitude of the philoso? pher of biology is, "there is no philosophy of biology to be done there." Even in philo? sophical contexts in which concerns with his? torical significances of evolution appear to be central, there is not uncommonly a notice? able gap. The Philosophy of Biology in His? torical and Cultural Contexts course that was offered through the National Endow? ment for the Humanities to philosophers in the summer of 1989 is a case in point. Al? though ample attention was called to Dar? win, the "Darwinian tradition," and "Darwinism" in the two hundred and twenty-five word course description, the his 343</page><page sequence="2">344 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY torical side of evolution?the side that Darwin was at pains to explain?was nowhere al? luded to. The irony was compounded by the fact that, though the intent was in part to develop "a new and humanistically richer philosophy of science," paleoanthropology was nowhere mentioned. A further exemplification of standard philosophic practice centers on philosophers' interest in nonhuman animals, particularly but not exclusively in the context of philoso? phy of mind.6 The intent in these philosophi? cal enterprises is generally to shed light on the relationship between human and nonhu? man intelligence. For example, the intent has recently been "to help cognitive ethologists to interpret their findings,"7 or to aid cogni tively-oriented scientists by supplying them "a descriptive language and method that are neither anachronistically bound by behav iorist scruples nor prematurely committed to particular "information-processing models."8 Standard philosophic practice is apparent in such enterprises when, in the drawing of comparisons or implications, philosophers fail to take evolution, particularly our own human evolution, into account. The result is a failure to realize that short of divine inter? vention, human rationality, for instance, and human language, are themselves products of evolution, and not in the sense of novel neu? ral brain circuitry gradually (much less sud? denly) appearing?such that communally understood words one day began sprouting from the mouths of a few no doubt sur prised-because-heretofore-verbally-mute hominids?but in the sense of actual living creatures inventing new modes of behavior. Jonathan Bennett, in his 1987 Presidential Address to the Eastern Division American Philosophical Association, noticeably ig? nores human evolution in just this way. To begin with, he states that his aim is to specify "[the] main differences there are between Homo sapiens and other known terrestrial species, or (for short) between man and beast." He elaborates this aim by saying that he thinks we humans all intuit the same dif? ference?"I think we have the same picture of the difference, the same sense of what it is"9?and that his purpose is to try to "par? lay" that picture or intuition into "an agreed description."10 By way of further elabora? tion, he says that the difference he is inter? ested in descriptively pinpointing is a difference in kind and not in degree, and this on the basis of what we already think is there, that is, on the basis of "what we al? ready know about us and about them." The problem of course is what "we" do not know about us and about them. As is clear from what has been said thus far of standard philosophic practice, Bennett ignores what philosophers generally tend to ignore, that is, he tends to discount as relevant knowledge the actual historical process of evolution and with it, our own hominid history, the study of our own human evolutionary past.11 The im? port of this neglect is sizable. One aspect of it will become readily apparent in what fol? lows. Suffice to say here that without this historical dimension, those philosophical studies that aim at discovering relationships between human and nonhuman intelligence can never be anything more than a compari? son between present-day humans and pres? ent-day chimpanzees (or baboons, or lemurs, or langurs, or vervet monkeys, and so on?or pigeons and crows,12 for that matter). They will never tell us anything in an evolutionary, i.e., substantively biological?including ethological?sense about "what makes us special."13 They reduce simply to philosoph? ical justifications for cherishing ourselves. Standard philosophic practice is not un? commonly queer in an etymological sense, in the sense that what evolves are precisely or? ganic wholes, and in the sense that under? standing humanness was at least in the beginning what constituted the pursuit of philosophy. The counters identified in a mo? lecular biology and/or formulated in an axi? omatic system, for example, are not the stuff of evolution?the actual living process in vir? tue of which we are here today. That process is defined by all those sensing, moving crea? tures who found and made their niche in the world in myriad ways over eons of time? some of them successfully, many quite un? successfully?and it includes those creatures who constitute the subject matter of pale oanthropology and who, as relatives, should be dear to our human hearts. A concern with molecular regularities and with explana</page><page sequence="3">TAKING EVOLUTION SERIOUSLY / 345 tion?with evolutionary theory qua theory? need not devalue a concern with that histori? cal process or the creatures who define it?with evolutionary theory qua evolution? ary theory. More than this, the concern need not saw off the branches that support it. In default of an historical dimension, there could be other theories in biology?theories of spontaneous generation, of animal spirits, of a sentiment int?rieur, and other formulations in the conceptual style of a pre-Darwinian bi? ology, but there would be no theory of evolu? tion.14 Furthermore, as emphasized, to ignore the historical aspects of evolution is to omit understandings of our ancestral kin folk, thus to disregard significant dimensions of our own human evolution. Especially in light of their considerable accomplishments, our kinfolk matter. As with our own families, our biological Family tells us something about ourselves. When we examine our an? cestral past, we learn something about who we are. Such an examination is what in a truly philosophical sense Darwinian evolu? tionary theory was originally all about. Darwin wrote three major books on evolu? tion: The Origin of Species, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.15 In the first of these consecutive formulations, Darwin considers physical characters and behavior; in the second he considers mental powers and moral qualities, and then proceeds to a study of sexual be? havior; in the third he turns his attention to emotions. It is clear from these successive writings that Darwin is both an organic and evolutionary wholist. His initial concern with distinct aspects of animate form notwith? standing, he clearly regards animals not as piecemeal assemblages nor as reflex ma? chines on the order of "protoplasmic record changers,"16 but as, in eminent British biolo? gist J. S. Haldane's phrase, "persistent wholes;"17 and he furthermore regards the attributes and capacities of all creatures to have evolved. In consequence, evolutionary continuities pertain not simply to atomistic parts or to physical bodies but to animals as living wholes. By the same measure, they pertain not to some creatures but to all crea? tures: evolutionary continuities are evident throughout the animal kingdom, including humans, and they are describable in physical, mental, moral, sexual, and emotional terms. Darwin's three books attest incontrovertibly to this conception. Darwin's wholistic conception of evolu? tionary continuities is never mentioned in 20th century Western scientific or philo? sophic circles. It has never been openly chal? lenged. It has never been methodically rebutted. It has simply been ignored. By 20th century Western standards, only The Origin of Species and the second half of The De? scent?Selection in Relation to Sex?count as evolutionary theory. The rest is silence, but not necessarily because one knows not of what one might speak. On the contrary, an affirmation of evolutionary continuities be? yond the merely physical is an obvious di? mension of, for example, NASA programs utilizing nonhuman animals; medical and psychological studies of behavior in which nonhuman animals figure as subjects; lan? guage-learning programs featuring espe? cially chimpanzees, but also including gorillas and parrots; and more. The pressing question then is, why is there a selective reading of Darwin? Since never explicitly dis? credited, why is his organic and evolutionary wholism not taken seriously? Behaviorism and logical positivism might go a long way in answering the question, but they are far from providing the whole an? swer. With resoect to the neglect of "the de? scent of man," the whole answer would likely take in cultural relativism and the not unre? lated structuralist emphasis on synchrony over diachrony since both doctrines, in es? chewing in one way and another the notion of "getting back," would see no philosophi? cal significance in the descent itself and/or no cultural relevance of the descent to modern humans. Each of these avenues of response would be interesting to consider. The focus here, however, will be on a quite different answer, namely, reverse anthropocentrisme8 Because it has not been previously exposed and because it sheds a basic and particularly penetrating light on the selective reading of Darwin and the decline of his organic and evolutionary wholism, the practice of re</page><page sequence="4">346 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY verse anthropocentrism is of considerable interest and import. The charge of anthropocentrism is nor? mally a pejorative judgment rendered upon a person who interprets the behavior of non human creatures in ways which humanize the behavior and in turn credit the creature with far more in the way of intelligence than the creature actually deserves. Morgan's canon is rigorously adhered to by biologists as a bulwark against anthropocentrism. Morgan's canon dictates that no nonhuman animal behavior may be interpreted at a higher level if it can be explained at a lower level.19 The canon is often equated to parsi? mony, though Occam's notion of parsimony was tied to maintaining a spartan explana? tory ontology, not to the formulation of what must be regarded self-serving explanatory protocols. What the charge of reverse an? thropocentrism pinpoints and calls into question is precisely the customary practice in virtue of which the charge of an? thropocentrism is purportedly avoided in the first place. Most simply stated, it is the charge that reading humanness out is itself an anthropomorphic act. By such an act, nonhuman creaturely life is interpreted in a way which exalts the measure of humanness: humans become special creations. Man is in? deed the measure of all things in a reverse anthropocentrism?man understood here not as independently-perceiving individuals but as self-privileging %beings apportioning sub-mental credit to the whole of creation from on high.20 Indeed, reading out is an ag? grandizing gesture by which the whole human species is plucked out?saved as it were?from its place in the evolutionary mainstream of life. It is thus clear why to depreciate nonhuman animal behavior is a denial of evolutionary wholism. The same strict interpretive rule that applies to nonhu? man animals?Morgan's canon?does not apply to humans. In consequence, humans can be as generous and self-flattering as they please toward themselves. The charge of re? verse anthropocentrism calls into question the practice of protecting and privileging hu? mankind in this way. It affirms the fact that it is as anthropocentric to deal humans all the cards as it is to deal nonhuman animals too many aces. Organic wholism, like evolutionary who? lism, falls by the wayside with a reverse an? thropocentrism. Intelligence, cognitive acumen?what is customarily associated with mind?all such capacities are divorced from the body and regarded special cre? ations along with their unique human pos? sessors.21 Thus implicit in a reverse anthropocentrism is the belief that unlike the human body, the human mind never evolved. Presumably it arose sui generis, deus ex machina, or by interplanetary inter? vention?perhaps we are the artificial intelli? gence of creatures on Alpha Centauri. An apparently ill-recognized fact and curious practice is connected with the belief. Philos? ophers who bring nonhuman animals into the human picture typically use them in a way quite unlike evolutionary scientists.22 Comparisons of humans to extant nonhu mans, particularly primates, are made by pri matologists, paleoanthropologists, and other evolutionary scientists not on behalf of spec? ifying immediate relationships but far dis? tant ones: the behavior of extant nonhuman primates serves as an analogical measuring stick for reckoning ancestral hominid behav? ior. This way of using data gathered on non human animals, or this use of "the comparative method" (as evolutionary sci? entists term it), is quite different from the way in which philosophers are prone to using it, namely, either to substantiate or to deny a resemblance between "us and them," "here and now." In short, unlike evolutionary sci? entists, philosophers do not consider primate or other nonhuman animal evidence in evo? lutionary perspective.23 It is because of this that the much-prized treasure, human uniqueness, can be so effortlessly secured: so long as the method is misunderstood, the ev? olutionary significance of nonhuman animal behavioral studies is missed; so long as the evolutionary significance of these studies is missed, our own evolution is ignored; so long as our own evolution is ignored, our kinfolk are ignored, and so long as our kinfolk are ignored, a reverse anthropocentrism is easily installed and practiced with the result that an</page><page sequence="5">TAKING EVOLUTION SERIOUSLY / 347 organic and evolutionary wholism continu? ally gives ground to special creation. It is with great interest one reads in Hume a lengthy footnote explaining both why hu? mans differ among themselves with respect to reasoning powers, and why humans differ from nonhumans with respect to the same capacities. Hume's explanation is in princi? ple strikingly similar to Darwin's explana? tion of differing capacities among individual creatures with respect to a differential mor? tality and reproduction, so much so that Hume's explanation appears to be not sim? ply prescient but perhaps even a direct influ? ence on Darwin. That Darwin read Hume has been noted by historians of science.24 But historians have not observed the remarkable correspondence between Darwin's and Hume's accounts of differing capacities. For both Darwin and Hume, the latter were a matter of individual, native dispositions, whether human or nonhuman. Hume writes of individual humans differing "in attention and memory and observation," for example, in the ability "to carry on a chain of conse? quences," and in "the forming of general maxims from particular observation."25 The same native differential abilities that explain "the great difference" among humans in their various capacities to reason, Hume states, explain the great difference in various reasoning capacities between humans and nonhumans. For his part, Darwin first of all affirms that "If no organic being excepting man had possessed any mental power, or if his powers had been of a wholly different nature from those of the lower animals, then we should never have been able to convince ourselves that our high faculties had been gradually developed. But it can be clearly shewn that there is no fundamental differ? ence of this kind."26 He then proceeds to give evidence showing that "man and the higher animals, especially the Primates, have the same senses, intuitions and sensations?sim? ilar passions, affections, and emotions . . . they feel wonder and curiosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation, attention, memory, imagination, and reason, though in very different degrees."27 In sum, for Darwin as for Hume, just as there is a difference in degree and not in kind in capacities among animals of the same species, so there is a dif? ference in degree and not in kind between different species, i.e., between humans and nonhumans. In consequence, for neither Hume nor Darwin are there Rubicons to be crossed in accounting for human "minds." Put in evolutionary perspective, this means not only that "mental powers" (to use Darwin's phrase) evolved, but that they evolved as a dimension of animate life. Careful readings of Darwin's three classic works on evolution reveal many times over an organic and evolutionary wholism in op? position to the idea of special creation. Spe? cial creation and the practice of reverse anthropocentrism that in part upholds it are clearly inconsistent with evolutionary the? ory. Present-day philosophy of biology thus has another and quite different task from the one it presently addresses: to expose the in? consistency in all its guises and in conse? quence show how evolution is to be taken seriously, and can be taken seriously in the very doing of philosophy. The task in fact has possible far-reaching consequences for phi? losophy, beginning with a Cartesian meta? physics and ending perhaps with ethical investigations insofar as wholistic themes support evolutionary continuities and evolu? tionary continuities raise certain ethical questions?about the human treatment of nonhuman animals, for example. The task in this longer view might more rightly be desig? nated an mira-disciplinary one in that it ne? cessitates a broad philosophical perspective. It can be exemplified with respect to a Carte? sian metaphysics, specifically the classic mind/body dichotomy, by two seminal ques? tion: Can bodies evolve in the absence of mental powers?; and correlatively, can men? tal powers evolve in the absence of bodies? Suggestions follow as to the kind of evidence to be considered if just and sound answers are to be had. Of prime importance with respect to the first question are situations in which a crea? ture is engaged in some constructional activ? ity, constructional in the sense of the creature's devising from moment to moment in the light of a particular and immediate play of events. Thus, beavers building dams or lionesses hunting zebras?in fact hunting</page><page sequence="6">348 / AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY and hunted animals generally?must take into account the particular moment by mo? ment situation as it develops. There are no tapes on which all the right moves are re? corded such that no matter what the exi? gency, a neurological program exists. Constructional activity clearly calls into seri? ous question the idea that bodies have evolved or can evolve in the absence of men? tal powers.28 What must furthermore be considered is the fact that animals are from time to time initiating agents. They begin practicing new strategies, for example, or they implement new behaviors such that an entire group of creatures begins behaving in new ways. Not only is there now classic evidence of initiat? ing agents in primate groups studied by Jap? anese primatologists,29 but many of our own kinfolk were highly original initiating agents. Consistent bipedality was a new practice; tool-making was a new practice; burying the dead was a new practice; speaking was a new practice; counting was a new practice; cave painting was a new practice. Present-day hu? mans can look back as far as three and a half million years and find new practices. All of the practices attest to new concepts, as my research has shown.30 All of the practices were initiated by hominids. All humans are hominids but not all hominids are human. As represented by the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, humans arose only some 40,000 years ago.31 On the basis of paleoanthroplogical evidence to date, we can thus conclude that with one exception, the above-mentioned practices were initiated by nonhuman pri? mates. Recognition of the evidence thus mandates a recognition of mental powers outside an elitist human circle and provides powerful grounds for affirming that nonhu? man living bodies, simply on the basis of their nonhumanness, cannot reasonably be regarded as lacking mental powers. Evidence of animals as initiating agents is equally significant to a just and credible an? swer to the corollary question, can mental powers evolve in the absence of bodies? Short of a body, one can only wonder where the felt motivations, curiosities, and active explorations might be that sustain any thoughtful endeavor such as burying an indi vidual, chipping away at one stone with an? other, or hammering away at something to see what is inside.32 It is not a question of brains?not only because it is "persistent wholes," not brains, that evolve?but be? cause it is not brains that are motivated, curi? ous, or explorative; it is creatures who are. The nonsensical, even comic, consequences of thinking otherwise are well exemplified by the biologist who affirmed that "Nonhu? man primates have brains capable of cooper? ative hunting,"33 as if when summoned by hunger, it is brains that roll forth in concert to do battle on the savannah. From a Dar? winian perspective, it is difficult to deny that the evolution of mental powers is tied to liv? ing bodies engaged in the real world of pro? curing food, escaping danger, finding new resources, exploring a new terrain, making choices in the pursuit of a mate, deterring rivals?in short, engaged in the demanding, challenging, complex, practical business of making a living. A just assessment of whether bodies can evolve in the absence of mental powers would also have to take into account nonhu? man animal behaviors that fall outside for? mally devised protocols. Two primate psychologists interested in tactically decep? tive behavior, for instance, have collected "anecdotal" data from a wide range of pri? matologists whose formal writings omit ref? erence to any such data. By way of example, one of the contributing primatologists tells of an old female mangabey who "would often use distracting tactics to get at food when the male was sitting over it. She would pace around him, keeping her eye on the food and in coming closer would 'accidentally' walk over a piece of food which would, of course, remain in her hand as she strolled off."34 The utilization of anec? dotal data within animal behavioral studies is of course sanctioned only by cognitively oriented scientists and philosophers?Dan? iel Dennett, for example;35 it is not sanctioned by behaviorists even though to omit anecdotal data is to leave gaps in the record, thus to be less than objective by giv? ing only a partial report?indeed, to give a "subjectively-biased" account of animal be? havior. By comparison, no physicist or as</page><page sequence="7">TAKING EVOLUTION SERIOUSLY / 349 tronomer who found an anomaly would ig? nore it on the basis of its being "anecdotal." Neither, of course, would students of human behavior overlook such a ploy as that of the female mangabey in their investigations of human actions. Moreover, in the human in? stance, the ploy would undoubtedly be clas? sified as "ingenious." One need look no further than Oliver North's cover-up to find what constituted for many Americans just such an "ingenious" example of tactical deception. However brief the above suggestions, they show that evolutionary biology has much to contribute to the discussion and resolution of certain metaphysical questions and of re? lated epistemological questions as well. In broader terms, they show that Darwin's twin themes of organic and evolutionary wholism clearly challenge us, both to expose inconsis? tencies in the evolutionary records we keep and to keep those cleared-up records in sight as we ourselves do philosophy. To be so chal? lenged is of course to acknowledge being part of a historical process infinitely larger than ourselves. The acknowledgment of that history, like the acknowledgment of the earth's revolution around the sun or the ac? knowledgment of our own death?the ac? knowledgment of any natural spatio temporal system of change?is in fact not only rational, but perhaps the necessary first step in understanding what it means to be rational, not to say in living up to the star billing we give ourselves as rational animals. In her interpretive essay on Aristotle's con? cept of pneuma and his concept of soul and body in De Motu Animalium, Martha Nussbaum was led to remark on the fact that "an essential part of [Aristotle's] search for the best account of animal physiology was an examination of the goal-directed motions of the heavenly spheres." In other words, for Aristotle, animal motion and heavenly mo? tion were essentially related and were to be studied and understood together. Nussbaum's conclusion is that Aristotle's view affirmed that "no being can be exhaus? tively studied without an account of his place? ment in the whole of nature"?a 2,300 year-old view that coincides significantly with Darwin's organic and evolutionary wholism.36 Eugene, OR Received November 21,1991 NOTES 1.

Daniel Dennett ignores the actual historical process of evolution to the extent that he takes present-day human adult intellectual abilities for granted?that is, he gives no indication of thinking of those abilities as having evolved?and that he aligns preverbal human children's intellectual abilities with those of nonhuman (presumably adult) animals. For example, although he points out that humans function at a lower intentional level than they might think, that like "vervet monkeys (and chimps and dolphins, and all other higher nonhuman animals) [humans] exhibit mixed and confusing symptoms of higher-order intentionality"?"[they are not] unproblematic exemplars of third- or fourth- or fifth-order intentional systems" ("Intentional Systems," p. 349)?he does not put the point in evolutionary perspec? tives (or even intimate that it might have such a perspective). Rather, he puts the comparison in the perspective of another comparison: that between small children and monkeys. He states, "I expect the results of the effort at intentional interpretations of monkeys, like the results of intentional interpreta? tions of small children, to be riddled with the sorts of gaps and foggy places that are inevitable in the interpretation of systems that are, after all, only imperfectly rational" {Ibid.) A later commentary fleshes out the reason for an "imperfect rationality." In the context of discussing how we are to interpret "animal messages," Dennett states his disagreement with Wittgentstein?that "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him." But he also goes on to say that "I do think we'd find the lion has much less to say about its life than we could already say about it from our own observation. Compare the question: What is it like to be a human infant? My killjoy answer would be that it isn't like very much. How do I know? I don't "know," of course, but my even more killjoy answer is that on my view of consciousness, it arises when there is work for it to do, and the preeminent work of consciousness is dependent on sophisticated language-using activities" (Ibid., p. 384). Clearly, an imperfect rationality is tied to a lesser consciousness, and a lesser consciousness to the lack of "sophisticated language-using activities." Forms of "imperfect rationality," however, were capable of fashioning stone tools and conceiving of death. There is no way of knowing exclusively of course just when verbal language evolved in the course of hominid evolution. On the other hand, there is a way of knowing when such practices as stone tool-making and burying the dead began, and these activities, as has been shown elsewhere (see Note 30), are not dependent on sophisticated language-using activities; they are rooted in the body. The very concept of a tool, like the complex concept of death, is a matter of corporeal matters of fact, thus of corporeal concepts. Taking evolution seriously holds the possibility of enlightening us about things we do not know. 12. For an incisive and at the same time thoroughly engaging commentary on the axiology implicit in academic nonhuman animal research studies, see (former primatalogist) Nicholas S.

I use the word "anthropocentrism" rather than "anthropomorphism" because it is not simply a question of the attribution or nonattribution of human characteristics to nonhuman animals, but a question of assuming humans as the center of the animate world such that, for example, any assessment of nonhuman mental powers must take as its standard of measurement a human mind. Anthropomor? phism may be a form of anthropocentrism, but not the reverse. Anthropocentrism has a much larger compass. Consider, for example, that humans are merely one among ten million species and they readily pronounce judgments on all remaining 9,999,999 even though, philosophically speaking, they have not shown conclusively that they are not dreaming or a part of someone else's dream (But see Albert A. Johnstone, Rationalized Epistemology [Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991], for consid? erable progress toward the resolution of such obdurate epistemological chestnuts.)</page><page sequence="9">TAKING EVOLUTION SERIOUSLY / 351 19. Lloyd Morgan, a comparative psychologist of the late 1800s and early 1900s, has actually been misinterpreted. His "canon," as Michael T. Ghiselin points out, "could in fact be invoked on the other side_A higher faculty could explain more behavioral facts than a lower one." The immediate point, however, is that what Morgan was enunciating was an evolutionary principle, not a principle of simplicity or parsimony. His canon was anchored in the evolutionary fact that lower forms of intelligence developed before higher ones, and are thus represented to a greater degree in the evolutionary world than the latter. It is not then a question of "logical simplicity, but of theoretical probability" (Ghiselin). See Lloyd Morgan, The Animal Mind (New York: Longmans, Green and Co., 1930); Michael T. Ghiselin, "Lloyd Morgan's Canon in Evolutionary Context," a response to Daniel G Dennett's "Intentional Systems in Cognitive Ethology: The Tanglossian Paradigm' Defended," Behavioral Brain Sciences vol. 6 (1983), pp. 362-63, quotes from p. 363. 20. It might be pointed out that, however unenlightened Protagoras's (reinterpreted) gender-biased claim might appear today, his sexist generalization cannot be criticized: males unequivocally command worldviews and practices in present-day Western society, including the present-day worldview and practice of reverse anthropocentrism. 21. Wilfrid Sellars's "Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man" is a prime if extreme example. In this article, Sellars presents an unabashed argument for "Special Creation" (his phrase, his capitalizations). See his Science, Perception and Reality (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963), pp. 1-40. 22. See, for example, Joseph Margolis, Persons and Minds (Boston: D. Reidel, 1978); Mary Midgley, Beast and Man (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1978); Peter Carruthers, "Brute Experience," Journal of Philosophy vol. 86 (1989), pp. 258-69. 23. Jonathan Bennett's assessment of rationality in honeybees is an excellent instance of this lack of an evolutionary perspective. See his Rationality (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964). 24. See, for example, Robert J. Richards, Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987). 25.

A reviewer of this article believed that there was a logical problem created by my using hunting as an example of how bodies cannot evolve in the absence of mental powers since hunting is an example of how bodies do require mental powers. Whether there is a logical problem or not turns to my mind on whether our concern is with evolutionary forms of life as we know them or whether our concern is with other possible forms of life. My concern is with actual evolutionary processes. Hence whether bodies do or can evolve in the absence of mental powers concerns actual living forms, i.e., cases in point. My claim is that given the nature of constructional activity as described in the text, that is, given the necessity of a discriminating, moment-by-moment, finely-attuned perceptual system to predator and prey alike, it is implausible to think that the particular bodies concerned could carry out pr?dation or escape in the absence of mental powers. The question of bodies evolving in the absence of mental powers, then, is akin to a thought experiment on the basis of empirical matters of fact, to wit, is the life of a particular predator (such as a lioness) or prey (such as a zebra) such that it could do without mental powers? My answer here, as with the constructional activities of beavers, is "no." 29. See M.

The time-span, 40,000 years, might be debated depending on how current questioning of the relationship between Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthal hominids is ultimately resolved, i.e., are modern-day humans descendants of Neanderthals or did modern humans interbreed with and then replace Neanderthals? See B. Bower, "Neanderthals Get an Evolutionary Face-Lift," Science News 135/15 (April 15,1989), p. 229 for a discussion of the recent controversy. See C. L. Brace and M. F. Ashley Montagu, Man's Evolution (New York: Macmillian, 1965) for a detailed and lucid discussion of the original and developing controversy over Neanderthals. 32. Lest it be thought that such activities are reserved to primates alone, it should be noted that English tits began an entirely new practice?pecking open the waxboard lids of delivered milk bottles. The first-recorded instance of this activity was in 1921. Since then, the thirst-quenching practice spread both across species and geographically, from its original sighting in Southampton to Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland. See James Fisher and R.A. Hinde, "The Opening of Milk Bottles by Birds," and "Further Observations on the Opening of Milk Bottles by Birds," both in The Function and Evolution of Behavior, ed. P. H. Klopfer and J. P. Hailman (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1972), pp. 366-73 and 373-78, respectively. 33. Robert S.O.

A fa?on de parler, it should be emphasized, is not dismissable as merely a way of speaking. Fa?ons de parler ate fa?ons d?penser, which means they have sturdily-positioned conceptual bases.

It might be noted that what is frequently overlooked in the skirmish between behaviorist and cognitivist is the fact that in the course of making a living, creatures behave in clever, off-beat ways that promote their well-being. And not only primates. One highly esteemed field study documented the fact that a female lioness, after a kill, pretended as if nothing had happened so that she would not have to share her bounty with anyone else. See George Schaller, The Serengeti Lion (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972), p. 268. 36. Martha Craven Nussbaum, Aristotle's DE MOTU ANIMALIUM (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 163 and 164, respectively. It might be noted that were Aristotle suddenly alive today, he would undoubtedly be busy revising his original biological treatises, studying animate life with as much zeal and thoroughness as originally, but enlightened now by the concept of phylogeny and its evidential foundations. Perhaps his contemporary interest in animate life would be philosophically infectious, as his ancient interest has not been.</page></plain_text>
