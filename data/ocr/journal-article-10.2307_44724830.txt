Viano ProBiomechanics LLC formerly Saab Automobile, AB and General Motors Corporation Copyright © 2004 SAE International ABSTRACT In this study, U.S. crash data was analyzed to better understand bounce-over rollovers. Crash data was reviewed to evaluate the distribution of bounce-over crashes and injuries, initiation objects and impact locations. In passenger cars, bounce-over crashes account for 8.4% of rollovers but involve 36.2% of the seriously injured belted drivers. Most bounce-overs are initiated by contact with narrow objects such as a pole, tree or barrier, or large objects such as a ditch or embankment. Contact often occurs in the front of the vehicle. After contact, the vehicle yaws and rolls, and serious injuries are often sustained to the head. Based on field data, a laboratory test was developed to simulate a narrow object bounce-over. The test consists of towing a vehicle laterally on a fixture towards a stationary, angled barrier resting in gravel. The moving fixture is decelerated and the vehicle is released. The vehicle front impacts the edge of the barrier, simulating a narrow object impact. The vehicle then yaws as its wheels dig into the gravel inducing a rollover. INTRODUCTION Rollover crashes have become an important safety issue. NHTSA (2000) reported that each year, there was an average of about 227,000 rollover crashes that occur on U.S. roads. These rollovers result in a yearly average of 9,063 fatalities and over 200,000 non-fatal injuries. When looking at the number of fatalities per registered vehicle, rollovers have the second highest rate after frontal crashes. As countermeasures are developed and vehicle structural crashworthiness, seat belt use and airbags improve frontal and side impact protection, the number of fatalities and serious injuries in these crashes will reduce. Rollovers will become even more significant because of these shifts and with the increasing number of SUVs, vans and trucks in the fleet. Various tests have been developed to evaluate the kinematics of occupants in simulated rollovers and to determine vehicle rollover dynamics. These tests include the FMVSS 208 dolly test (Orłowski et al, 1985), the ADAC corkscrew (http://www.adac.de), curb and soil tripped tests (Thomas et al, 1989; Cooperider et al, 1998), and fall-overs (Deley, 1987; Bardini et al, 1999). For passenger cars, Parenteau et al. (2003) found the tests represent more than 80% of the field relevant rollovers and 70% of seriously injured belted drivers. Of the field conditions not represented with laboratory tests, 13% of the seriously injured drivers were involved in a bounce-over. The objective of this study was to first review crash cases to identify the occurrence of bounce-overs and then to propose and conduct a bounce-over laboratory test. This information provides a better understanding of vehicle kinematics and occupant injury responses. It also provides input for the development and assessment of mathematical models of occupant kinematics and safety systems in bounce-over rollovers. METHODS Field Data Analysis Data: The data was obtained from the National Automotive Sampling System-Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS). NASS-CDS consists of police reported tow-away traffic crashes in the U.S. The database is a representative sample of about 5,000 crashes per year. Statistical sampling weights are provided, so that results can be extrapolated to represent the U.S. crash experience. The data includes detailed information from the NASS investigation teams. For this study, the data consists of rollover crashes that occurred in the years 1992 through 1998. 57</page><page sequence="2">Bounce-Over Definition: Bounce-over rollovers occur when a vehicle rebounds off a fixed object and overturns as a consequence. The rollover must occur in proximity to the object from which it is deflected (Figure 1). Figure 1 : Schematic of a bounce-over. Vehicle: For the field data analysis, passenger cars were used. Passenger cars included mini, small, midsize, and large cars. Drivers: In NASS-CDS, drivers were defined as occupants that were driving the vehicle (role = 01 ). Injuries: Serious injuries included injuries with AIS &gt; 3. In this study, an Injury Severity Score (ISS) was calculated for each injured and belted driver. ISS was chosen since it was shown to correlate well with mortality. Serious injury was classified as an ISS &gt;12. For bounce-overs, NASS-CDS does not differentiate whether serious occupant injury occurs in the initial impact with the fixed object or the rollover phase. Normalizing: The data was normalized to compare results between different rollover categories. Rate is defined as the number of rollover crashes or occupants in a particular category divided by the total number of rollovers or occupants. Laboratory Bounce-Over Test In the laboratory tests, anthropomorphic test devices (50th percentile male Hybrid III) were used to evaluate driver and right-front passenger kinematics and dynamics. All tests were conducted with lap-shoulder belted dummies, but pyrotechnic systems were deactivated during the testing, including belt pretensioners and airbags. The bounce-over test was limited to a 5-door sedan. RESULTS Crash Data: In the NASS-CDS database, trip-over crashes were most common at a rate of 56.2% (Figure 2). Bounce-over crashes accounted for 8.5% of passenger car rollovers. However, 32.4% of belted drivers were seriously injured in bounce-overs (Figure 3). This is probably due to the fact that most bounce- overs are part of multiple events since they require contact with a fixed object in order to rebound. The weighted and unweighted data is given in the Appendix.

However, embankment and barrier contacts were also common. Figure 4: Distribution of bounce-over crashes by initiation objects. During a bounce-over event, damage to the front of the vehicles occurred in 78.8% of the cases. Side damage took place in 19.8% of the cases (Figure 5). Rear and undercarriage impacts were infrequent. Figure 5: Distribution of bounce-over crashes by contact area on the vehicle. During bounce-over crashes, belted drivers most commonly sustained serious injuries to the head with a much lower incidence of serious thoracic injury. Head injuries occurred at a rate of 90% and thoracic injuries at 5% (Figure 6). Of the known injury sources coded in the database, head injuries resulted from contact with the roof. The extent of roof or vehicle damage was not studied. Figure 6: Distribution of serious injuries by body region. In addition to statistical analysis, individual NASS cases were reviewed. Figure 7 shows an example of a crash scene diagram for a bounce-over crash. The crash was described in the police report as: "the vehicle was traveling northbound on a 4 lane, median divided interstate. The driver lost control, going off the right side of the roadway and contacting a guardrail with its front. The vehicle then rolled right approximately 6 quarter turns, ejecting the occupant and coming to rest on its top". The unbelted driver sustained multiple factures in his back (MAIS 3) due to potential contact with the roof side rail.

This graph is similar to one in Parenteau et al. (2003), but has been updated using NASS-CDS 1992-98. Figure 8b: Laboratory tests representation of field relevant rollover distribution injured belted drivers in passenger cars. This graph is similar to one in Parenteau et al. (2003), but has been updated using NASS-CDS 1992-98. The field relevance of various laboratory tests has been assessed. Figures 8a &amp; 8b show the relevance of various laboratory tests on the left to real-world rollovers of passenger vehicles in the middle (see Parenteau et al. 2003 for more details). It also shows the relevance of the rollover tests to seriously injured and belted drivers. In both cases, bounce-over rollovers represent an important part of the field situation. These data also provide insight into the significance of other rollover types and tests. The field data was used to develop relevant laboratory rollover tests. The laboratory tests included the former FMVSS 208 dolly test, the fall-over ditch test, the ADAC corkscrew test, a soil trip test, a curb trip test and a new narrow object bounce-over test. This suite of tests was found to represent more than 85% of the crash rollovers and 85% of the seriously injured belted drivers involved in rollovers (Figure 8). The bounce-over test is particularly challenging from a sensing point of view because of the impact followed by the rollover. Figure 9: Photos of the 42 km/h lateral slide into a concrete block then rollover in gravel. Laboratory Bounce-Over Test Procedure: Based on the understanding of bounce-over crashes, a laboratory test was developed. In the test, a vehicle is carried sideways on a towed fixture at 42 km/h towards a stationary barrier and area filled with gravel (Figure 9). The moving fixture is decelerated at a known rate, releasing the vehicle. The barrier is angled such that the front of the vehicle impacts the edge of the barrier simulating a narrow object impact. As the front-right corner of the vehicle contacts the barrier, the vehicle yaws and rolls. The wheels dig into the gravel representing loose ground and a rollover is induced. Figure 10 shows the vehicle and occupant responses in the bounce-over test. As the vehicle slides into the gravel, there is an increase in roll angle to about 10° as the front strikes the concrete barrier. The barrier impact occurs at about 200 ms and decelerates the vehicle causing a lateral and vertical acceleration and a spike in the vehicle roll rate. The lateral acceleration is the greatest at about 3.5 g. The roll angle of the vehicle continues to increase to over 100° at rest. The head and chest accelerations of the dummy show the effects of the barrier impact and rollover, but the magnitudes are far below injury tolerance levels. This is also true of the neck moment. The dummy responses show mostly the effects of the initial barrier impact and only minor responses through the subsequent rollover phase in this test. However, the cause of real-world injury probably varies between occupant contacts due to the initial impact and subsequent rollover depending on the type of bounce-over. 60</page><page sequence="5">Figure 10: Time histories of vehicle (top four graphs), and driver (left) and right front passenger (right) responses (bottom six graphs) in the bounce-over test. DISCUSSION Based on the analysis of Parenteau et al. (2003), the field relevance of a suite of laboratory tests was determined (Figure 8). The laboratory tests include soil trips, curb trips, ADAC corkscrew, fall-over ditch, the former FMVSS 208 and a new narrow object bounce- over described in this paper. For the analysis, it was assumed that curb-trip tests represent both the curb contact initiated trip-overs and all the ditch/embankment and 20% barrier contact initiated bounce-overs, while the bounce-over test represented field bounce-overs initiated by a narrow object contact. These narrow objects included trees, poles, fire hydrants and 80% of barriers. As a result, the laboratory tests were found to represent less 85% of field rollover conditions for passenger cars and 85% of seriously injured belted drivers (ISS &gt; 12). Field crash data was analyzed to identify the propensity of bounce-over crashes in passenger cars. The distribution of rollover crashes and seriously injured drivers was first determined by roll type. Bounce-overs accounted for 8.5% of all rollovers, but involved 32.4% of the seriously injured belted drivers. Most bounce- overs result from a frontal impact prior to the roll. The assessment of safety countermeasures should include a test representing a bounce-over, because of the relatively high injury potential. However, the NASS-CDS does not differentiate whether serious occupant injury occurs in the initial impact with the fixed object or the rollover phase. It seems likely that the combination of loading environments is a factor in these crashes. The bounce-over test involved a low movable barrier for the frontal impact object. While it may not be completely representative of a tree or pole, it provided a reasonable object that could be conveniently placed in the crash path in the test laboratory. Other object sizes, shapes and weight were considered to vary the significance of the initial impact. The final test parameters were selected after considering the various aspects of the rollover sequence and emphasis of the project on rollover crash sensing. Obviously, more extensive analysis may be undertaken to select parameters for SUVs, vans and trucks. This would include the speed of impact, height and weight of the vehicle with respect to the barrier and positioning of the barrier adjacent to the gravel pit. When the bounce-over test was first discussed, the expertise of staff at Millbrook and Delphi were helpful in selecting a procedure with a reasonable degree of repeatability. Also, mathematical modeling was used to simulate the test and helped in the selection of parameters used, including the impact speed and mass of the block. This also aided in defining a test with a reasonable degree of repeatability. The discussions and research led to the use of the sliding floor to have a repeatable impact speed and orientation of impact into 61</page><page sequence="6">the block, a movable block of know size and mass so a momentum exchange determination could be made and analyzed using mathematical models, and the use of gravel rollover pit, which would give reliable vehicle kinematics. The impact speed was determined from modeling the momentum exchange in the impact with the block. These factors were setup so the test would be reasonably repeatable. In addition, the bounce-over test selected does not have the severity to ensure a substantial head impact, particularly with belted dummies. This was understood in the selection of the test parameters. The aim of the research was to determine minimum crash sensing requirements not to simulate the life-threatening conditions of vehicle rollovers. It was felt that more severe rollovers in the bounce-over mode would be sensed if the threshold condition tested could be sensed. Head impact rollovers would require another degree of impact severity than used in this test. With a high frontal crash component of the barrier impact, the activation of belt pretensioners and frontal airbags may occur early in the real-world rollover sequence. Since the rollover phase happens later and takes time to develop, the phasing of side curtain activation is a factor in the overall evaluation of occupant protection. These factors would be important to potential interior occupant impacts. In addition, the front and often offset nature of the initial barrier impact will cause the occupant to move forward and lateral in the vehicle. This may place them out-of- position when side curtains or airbags are deployed. The timing of the vehicle and occupant kinematics will vary from crash to crash and the kind of bounce-over test developed, however the test shown here sheds some light on the timing of various events. The use of computer simulation may help in understanding the sensitivity of responses to changes in the impact parameters and test conditions. In some cases, the offset deceleration may be sufficient to activate both the frontal and side airbags. In this case, the duration of inflation will be a factor in the status of the airbag during the rollover phase as well as the varying position of the occupant during the crash. Obviously, belt use is fundamentally important to the overall protection of the occupants and prevention of ejection.
