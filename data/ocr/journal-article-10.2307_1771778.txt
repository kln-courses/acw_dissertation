<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Languages and Cultures 5, 2 (1992): 133-156 SONGS FROM THE AKWA IBOM AND CROSS RIVER STATES OF NIGERIA Robert Kwami 1. Background Between January 1981 and October 1983, when I carried out investigations into aspects of Nigerian traditional life, the four ethnic groups which I studied were all in the Cross River State. Since then, the State has been divided into the Akwa Ibom and (new) Cross River States. I carried out the investigations while living and working at Uyo, capital of the Akwa Ibom State, and I focused on the Annang, Efik, Ibibio and Oron groups. I made attempts to learn Ibibio (both Annang and Efik are Ibibio dialects). I also investigated other aspects of traditional Annang and Ibibio life such as religion, customs, lineage and music. In the latter, I was especially interested in children's songs, particularly with regard to how they could be used in school curricula. My research assistants, students at the College of Education at Uyo, and I made visits to villages in the Abak, Ika, Ikot Ekpene, Itu and Oron local government areas where we collected over two hundred songs. In this paper, I shall discuss some of the songs which I collected from the Oron, Ikot Ekpene and Itam areas. The Itam songs come from the village of Mbribit where I conducted day trips while my assistants, under my direction, collected songs from Oron and the village of Atai Esien in Ikpot Ekpene. Recent literature dealing with African vocal music includes Jones' (1973) musical study of Swahili epic poetry, Ekweme's (1980) 'theory of melodic scales', Fiagbedzi's (1977) work on Anlo music and a later (1979) work on religious traditions in African music. Other works include Agawu's (1988a, 1988b and 1990) studies on northern Ewe songs, and Nayo's (undated) article on Akpalu's songs. Earlier relevant texts include those of Jones (1959), Nketia (1962, 1963 and 1975) and Blacking's (1967) ethnomusicological study of Venda children's songs; while the work of Lomax (1968) relates song structure to social structure. Some researchers such as Mensah (1971), Nketia (1973) and Nzewi (1980) have focused on African folk songs, while other writers like Bebey (1975: 119-24), Nketia (1963 and 1975: 177-205) and Braimah (undated), have highlighted the links between African music and literature. During the early stages of my field work, I consulted works by Akpabot (1975), Amadi (1982), Bascom and Herskovits (1959: 49-86; 279-299), Blacking (1976), Merriam (1964) and Nketia (1975). The investigation, a small-scale and eclectic enquiry, initially started as an analysis and compilation of children's songs but it broadened out to include other songs. I have</page><page sequence="2">134 Robert Kwami reported on other aspects of the investigation elsewhere (see Kwami, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1991a, 1991b, and 1991c). In the present context, I shall focus on a musicological and textual analysis of fourteen of the songs. 2. An age-gender classification After analysis, I grouped the songs according to age and gender, using the categories adults/adolescents/children/all community members and mixed/ female/male (see Kwami, 1989: 56-64, 1990 and 1991c). Age and gender are important concepts in traditional life among the Annang, Efik, Ibibio and Oron peoples; they play a major role in everyday life and govern the organisation of traditional institutions such as initiation schools and age grades. The performance of traditional songs is often organised according to sex: there are some for males, some for females, and others for mixed groups. In addition, age is sometimes used to distinguish between song types. As I have stated elsewhere (see Kwami, 1989: 57 and 1991c: 129), the classification warrants some qualifications. First, children's and adolescents' groups are not usually divided as has been shown. Age groups or grades have a range of four or five years. Vertically, as confirmed by writers such as Kaye (1962), Herskovits (1967) and Akpan (1983) on West African cultures, non- adults are often organised according to uni-sexual age groups; and horizontally, as stated by Isighe (1982) primarily with respect to the Annang, but from personal observation with equal applicability to other groups, this is a common habitat or a group of homesteads, a village or section thereof. Secondly, it is significant that children play and imitate adult music. Not only does this show the inadequacy of the chosen categories in real life; it also leads to the conclusion, partly as a result of Isighe's (1982) suggestion, that children's songs may not necessarily be simpler than adults' songs. Children are often attracted to adults' music, especially that forbidden to them. Perhaps ekpo-ntok eyen ('ekpo for children') formally allows boys to imitate ekpo which is performed by adult males! Godwin Agbeli, an Ewe master drummer, illustrates the attraction of children to adult music as follows: 'When a goat visits your farm ... and you continually drive it away, it will always come back to eat your corn because it knows that there is something of worth on your farm. Therefore, all the drums [i.e., music and dances] associated with traditional religions are fancied by children in my village' (field work interview in Ghana, 1986; see also Kwami 1989: 45-6 and 1991c: 129). But, as stated by Jones (1959) about the Ewe, it is adults who often compose and perform children's songs; this also seems to apply to the Annang, Efik, Ibibio and Oron as demonstrated by an analysis of their children's song texts and music. Thirdly, it may be possible to extend the application of the classification to other cultures. In a previous paper (Kwami, 1990), I applied the classification</page><page sequence="3">Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria to the Ibibio culture after a cross-cultural application (Kwami, 1989) to the four cultural groups.

In the case of the first two, this is because they are accessible to communal members in all four cultural groups, while the masquerade examples used qualify to be put into boxes for children and adolescents. 3. The songs: text and music The discussion of the song types mentioned in Fig. 1 starts with a work song and continues with songs from the life cycle. Two masquerade examples then precede a combination of children's and adolescents' songs. Finally, there are examples of adults' songs. 135</page><page sequence="4">136 Robert Kwami In the musical analyses, I have used descriptive notations; these are sometimes problematic in cases of free rhythm and/or where the main emphasis is on the text (i.e., on the tonal inflections and delivery of the words) rather than on the music. An intention to minimise the use of accidentals, following broadly the style used by Nketia (1973: 3 after Lachmann [1940]), means that the pitches do not represent the pitches in which the songs were performed; in other words, I have transposed the songs in all cases. 3.1. A work song Among the Annang and Ibibio, work may be done according to gender or in mixed groups. A work song or recitation such as the following usually has a 'call' which is answered by a 'response'. (1) An Annang work song/recitation Utom ete nnyin ikut - The work of our father tortoise (approximate pitches) CALL RESPONSE / I U- tor e- te nnyin i - kut Kpl- fin U- to- - ku- re- ke RESPONSE 9 Y4 R4,5,6 1,2,3,4,5,6 A Kpa_m- fin I- na- na --m_k- so Kpa_m - fin U- Kpa_m - fin CALL: Utom ete nnyin ikut The work of our father tortoise RESPONSE: Kpa mfin Certainly today CALL: Utom me ikureke If the work is not finished RESPONSE: Kpa mfin Certainly today CALL: Inam ika iso We will continue it RESPONSE: Kpa mfin Certainly today In this song from the village of Atai Essien, I have included the word 'certainly' in the translation to indicate the emphatic role of the word 'kpa'. An anthropomorphism is shown in the role of 'father tortoise' - the person for whom the work is being done. Although the song is appropriate for a male subject, it is possible that the song could also be performed for a female subject. The song was sung seven times without a break. In a work situation, one would expect it to be performed for as long as the leader felt necessary. The song can be seen as a recitation in Sprechstimme (speech-song) which closely follows the tonal inflections of the words. The three pitches used,</page><page sequence="5">Songs from the Akwa hIom and Cross River States of Nigeria 137 representing different levels of tone (HT = high tone; MT = medium tone and LT = low tone) in the (Annang) language, constitute a trichord: It is noteworthy that although there are three vocal parts, there is no attempt at harmonisation in the responses. For their part, the responses are repetitive; and they always echo the last two or three notes of the call. The melodic structure, incorporating both calls and responses - there is no (rhythmic) overlapping of parts - consists of three, four-pulse or two-bar, phrases. The second phrase is musically but not textually similar to the first, and both are answered by the final phrase; hence, the following structure emerges: a + a + b. Although there is a slight rhythmic laxity in the temporal alignment between the calls and responses, there is a strong feeling of a rhythmic hemiola of the type identified by Nketia (1975: 127): . J J. J J J ] thus, in bars 1, 3 and 5, a duple effect is followed in bars 2, 4 and 6 by a triple effect. I have identified four cases of assimilation involving the conflation of syllables/vocables and have numbered these on the score. [Number 1 shows a conflation of a and m in the response part; number 2 is an assimilation in which an e is substituted with the following i; while the final two examples (numbers 3 and 4) involve the word ika: in the first case, the i is conflated with the preceeding m; while, in the second, the i following the word is conflated with it to produce a diphthong.] 3.2. Songs from the life cycle Annang, Efik and Ibibio life cycle songs include toilet training, crawling and walking songs. A toilet training song may instruct a child about proper and improper toilet behaviour: (2) An Ibibio toilet training song Eyen tietie ke asana - Child, sit on the chamber pot E- yen tie- tie ke_a-sa- na E- yen ka_i- kot ke_a - sa - na K'u r5- 1 j 11 j_ L Jd d I 7</page><page sequence="6">138 Robert Kwami su_u-ka_i-kot ke_i - son . E- yen o o o o 0- mo- kop o a i 2 Z j ji1TT o o 0- mo - kop oo o o a Eyen tietie ke asana Child, sit on the chamber pot Eyen ka ikot ke asana Child, stool in the chamber pot K'usu uka ikot ke ison Never stool on the ground Eyen -oo- -o-o Child-o-o-o-o Omokop - o - o - o ? Have you heard - o - o - o ? Omokop - o - o - o ? Have you heard - o - o - o ? This song, collected from Mbrivit, was sung twice without a break. The phrase ka ikot, literally meaning 'go to the bush,' is a polite way of saying 'defecate.' The song uses a heptatonic scale. Although it is homophonic, suggesting a hymn by its four-part arrangement, the bass closely mirrors the alto part, thereby creating parallel octaves between both parts. The use of consecutive (perfect) fourths and fifths is also heard in the alto, tenor and bass parts at some points. A unique feature of the tenor part is its use of a (dominant) pedal in much of the music. There is a clear feeling of duple metre, but a strong hemiola (triple) effect is felt in every other bar (in bars 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11). The phrases are anacrusic, each is two bars long. The melodic and harmonic structure of the piece is encapsulated in the first four bars; the rest of the piece is simply a repetition of those bars with textual changes. The first two bars can be seen as a question (chords I - II) which is answered by the next two bars (chords V(7)- I). It may seem unnecessary to give so much musical interest to a toilet training song, particularly to its harmonisation. It is obvious that the top part has the melody and that its harmonisation demonstrates the instantaneous improvisation which is an inherent aspect of music-making in many parts of Africa. It is conceivable that if only two people were performing this song the accompaniment would mainly use thirds and/or sixths. Crawling songs are intended to encourage a child to crawl. In the text of the following song, a child is enticed to crawl using fish as an incentive.</page><page sequence="7">139 Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria (3) An Ibibio crawling song/recitation Eyen - o - Child - o a j r- $ p - 0- j jI I E - yen o E - yen o Di_m- bo i- yak o De i--- - I ?

It appears that the pulse in the responses is intended to help a child to learn how to crawl. The responses also show a doubling of the melody at the octave. Since there is only one instance in which a call overlaps a response (bar 9), it is conceivable that one person could perform the song for a child. However, the melody of the response (consisting of tonic - supertonic - tonic) easily lends itself to harmonisation (using chords I - V - I). This suggests that the song may be intended to be performed by a group of people rather than by an individual. Although the song is based on a tetrachord, the overall impression given is that of a heptatonic (major) scale. CALL RESPONSE</page><page sequence="8">140 Robert Kwami Like a crawling song, a walking song may involve a reward as is shown in the example below: (4) An Ibibio walking song/recitation Isan - o - Walk - o A L .I G D rV I I i7 ?

Like the previous example, it has a repetitive response; but it is performed in unison. Now, since the music is more of a recitation than a song, the pitches used in the transcription merely approximate the speech tones. A distinctive, complicatory, feature at the end of each response is a falling glissando or scoop on the word nta. Life cycle songs include birth, naming or outdooring songs. A birth song may be about the giving of gifts to newly-bom babies: CALL RESPONSE CALL: RESPONSE: CALL:</page><page sequence="9">Songs from the Akwa Ihom and Cross River States of Nigeria 141 (5) An Efik birth song Mkopiofiok ebiet eyen amanade - If I know where a child has been bom L 2- I - e 7, M - kpo- fio-fiok_(e)-bie (t)_(e)- ye- n_a- ma- na- de M- kpo-no_e- ka m- kpo e- :g 7lFi- 51a~i ye- n_u- to- m_M- kpo- fio- fiok_(e)-bie(t)_(e)- ye- n_a- ma- na- de M- kpo-no e- ka m - kpo e - ye- n_u- to- m_M- etc. -? r' [_[X \ F| LLO FF Mkopiofiok ebiet eyen amanade If I know where a child has been born Mkpokono eka mkpo eyen utom I will go and give the child's mother a gift [Four times] This song, which was also collected from Mbribit, consists of two lines of text which are repeated four times. In much of the music, a descant is heard above the melody. The two lower parts vary their harmonisations according to the improvisational skills and preferences of the performers. A heptatonic scale is used with a flattened seventh. This seventh appears exclusively in the tenor part and is lower than the flattened leading note in a major scale (cf. Nketia 1962: 34 and Ekweme 1980: 103). Consequently, it would be wrong to suggestt that the song is in a major key although the style is reminiscent of Christian hymnody.</page><page sequence="10">142 Robert Kwami A naming song, like the following, may extol the gift of children: (6) An Efik naming song Eyen edi ubon ke ererimbot - A child is a symbol of honour on earth E- yen e- di_u-bon ke' re- rim bot, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke_n- sin- si, E- ^iiH [f Lf--= id yen e- di_u- bon ke' re- rim bot, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke_n- sin- si, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke' re- rim bot, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke_n- sin- si, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke' re- rim bot, E- yen e- di_u- bon ke_n- sin- si Eyen edi ubon ke ererimbot A child is a symbol of honour on earth Eyen edi ubon ke nsinsi A child is a symbol of honour for ever [Four times] This song, from Mbribit, has an anacrusis at the beginning of its phrases. The tonal structure of the song is similar to that of the previous one: the tenor is the only part to use the flattened seventh, the musical unit of four bars constitutes a phrase, and this is repeated four times. However, there are a number of differences: the melody is heard in the topmost part, the second part harmonises the melody a third lower throughout, and the bass uses only four notes (C, E, F and G). Nevertheless, the previous and present songs are structurally, tonally, contextually and textually related.</page><page sequence="11">Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria Lullabies, like the work song genre, are accessible for all communal members, and are a legitimate example from the life cycle. This Annang example conjures a scene where a mother sings to her child. In the text, we see that the integrity of the child's nurse, its surrogate mother, is questioned. (7) An Annang Lullaby Eyen daiya dop uyo - o! - Child, sleep don't cry! E-yen daa do-u-yo U- kaa-kae-kpe-nei- ko- A- kae-ke-buo-koi- kpo-noA- E-yen da_i-ya do-p_u-yo o U- ka_a-ka_e-kpe-nei- ko-t_o A- ka_e-ke-buo-koi- kpo-n_oA- -L Jmi4 .$j ;l J nhzm}LI4 a' .2i da_o-so-k_e-de-p_e- yen o E- de-p_e- ye-n_i- nua i- nua o o o o o o Eyen daiya dop uyo - o! Child, sleep don't cry! Uka aka ekpene ikot - o! Mother will go to the farm - o! Aka ekebuoko ikpon - o! She will go and uproot cocoyam - o! Ada osok edep eyen - o! And bring cocoyam for the child-nurse - o! Edep eyen inua inua - o! The child-nurse is mouth-mouth - o! O-o!o-o! O-o!o-o! The lullaby was collected from Atai Essien. I have been told by an Annang indigene (Charles Isighe, during field work, 1983) that the double use of the word inua may have something to do with the Ibibio phrase 'only the mouth will acknowledge you as a child-nurse'. But this does not have as much significance for me as 'child-nurse is mouth-mouth'. In West African pidgin English, this means that the child-nurse is someone who says things which she cannot or does not do, someone who boasts. The piece, a solo sung twice, may be described as a musical recitation. There is a pronounced use of assimilation of the kind noted earlier in the discussion on another Annang song (see (1)). An example of this is the softening of the consonants p and t (bars 1, 4, 7 and 9). Structurally, there are two melodic segments in the music. The first, a one-phrase strophe, is repeated five times without a break; the second, also a phrase, is based entirely on the o vowel. The latter, heard only once, at the end of the piece, contains all four notes of the tetrachord on which the piece is based, unlike the former which has three of the notes. The following figure illustrates the order in which the notes are introduced in the piece: The penultimate note (A), heard only once, seems to be a structural variation, substitute or subordinate to the final note (D). 143</page><page sequence="12">144 Robert Kwami  _ -_ -- i - -- _m Substitute or subordinate to D ^ "^ I - ' I Hypo-dorian/dominant relationship'? In a modal structure, the former note could be described as 'hypo-dorian' and the latter as 'dorian'. In functional tonality the former would be the 'dominant' and the latter the 'tonic'. However, since we are dealing with a tetrachordic scale, these decriptors may not be applicable. Perhaps comparisons with other non-Western musics, such as with the raga of Indian music (see, for example, Farrell 1990: 22-26, 112) may be more appropriate. Structurally, the most important note in the strophic phrase is the final (D): The phrase starts with the note (C) which is a tone lower and then goes up by two tones (E) before the note (D) is heard for the first time; the opening note is heard once more, on a nodal or stress point, before the phrase ends: In reductionist terms, this can be analysed in the following stages: (i) C - E - D; C - D; (ii) C (E)- D; C - D; (iii) C - D; C - D; (iv) C ; D; (v) D! This line of argument suggests a tetratonic scale or a tetrachordic structure based on a dorian mode: 3.3 Masquerades Masquerades are performances incorporating music and dance in which masks are used. Some masquerades are believed to be manifestations of ancestral and other spirits on periodic visits to the physical world. Those who inhabit the masks are supposed to take on some of the attributes, characteristics and powers of the spirits that they represent. According to Akpan (1983) the term ntok-odiodio, literally meaning 'children of the mother ghost', is believed by the Ibibio to be a representation of the god of children. It is a masquerade which is accessible for all members of a community. It is performed at social functions such as birth rites, festivals, the installation of chiefs and funerals. Its main aim is to entertain. Whereas ntok-odiodio is a benign masquerade, ekpo which is exclusive to male adults has been known to maim uninitiated people (see, for example, Akpan 1983: 55-56; Udom 1983: 20-24). Akpan (1983: ii) has identified two main classes of masquerades among the Ibibio: entertainment and cult</page><page sequence="13">Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria masquerades, and these are also found among the other three groups. This section will deal with two entertainment masquerade songs. Etienam (1983: 39) says that uko 'is a popular dance of the Oron people. Both children and grown ups perform the dance on important occasion[s]. It is sung mainly to celebrate any great achievement or successful event'. Below is an example of an uko masquerade song: (8) An uko Song from Oron Eku yak ebei fi oto - Don't allow them to push you down E- ku ya-k_e-bei fi_o-to_i- ma- la_u- ti- tu- k E- 1 2 2 i i r:I t n: ,, ku ya- k_e- bei fi_o-to_i- ma- la_u- ti- t_u- ko E- kiong m- kpe- fe.

After the cadence, the piece is repeated four times. The main part of the second phrase, excluding the cadence, is a direct rhythmic sequence of the first; melodically, this is mainly a tone lower. The piece is based on this hemitonic pentatonic scale: nodal note In modal terms, the final note C, on which the piece is based, can be interpreted as a 'dominant' provided a tonal shift on the final cadence is recognised. The transposition of the phrase down a tone in the second phrase suggests a tonal shift, and this is partly confirmed musically but not textually in the final cadence; taking the starting notes of the two phrases and the cadence, this falling line C-Bb-A emerges. 145</page><page sequence="14">146 Robert Kwami The other masquerade song is from Abang which, according to Etienam (1983), is a dance for children especially girls aged between six and eleven. She also says that Ukpafim, initiator of the dance, is an allegorical name: (9) An introductory song for the Abang masquerade Ukpafim koku Abang - Ukpafim is calling Abang U- kpa- fim ko- ku_A- bang U- kpa- fim ko- ku_A- bang U- kpa- fim ko- ku_A- bang E e U- kpa- fim ko- ku_A- bang Ukpafim koku Abang Ukpafim is calling Abang E - e Yes, yes Ukpafim koku Abang Ukpafim is calling Abang Nene Etienam collected this song from Oron and I transcribed it (see Etienam 1983: 27b). Whereas the textual and musical phrases are largely based on an anacrusis, there is another musical sequence which overlaps this structure. It is a rhythmic sequence based on this cell: IJ mJn which is heard three times. Starting on E, it rises up a step and then returs to its first statement with a modification that leads into an extension. The sequence uses intervals of this tetratonic scale on which the piece is fashioned: After a repeat of the two main phrases, the music ends with the extension which is a slight variation of the main motif. 3.4. Children's and adolescents' songs For the next set of categories, it is practicable to conflate children's and adolescents' groups. Those included here are pre-adults aged between five and eighteen. I have stated elsewhere (Kwami 1984) that mme mbre (plural for mbre) is an Ibibio concept that embraces recreational and leisure activities. The term literally means 'play' and it has been put in all mixed gender boxes (Figure 1) which admit children.

It tells the story of an innocent orphan who is accused of murdering Ndo. For clarity, the phrase Akpema esin mien, esin Ndo - o can be translated as 'In which to put me and Ndo - o'. The song utilises responsorial form in which there is some variation in the call parts. In the accommodation of syllables within the time span between the responses, there is melodic variation based on tonal inflections of the words. In the responses, the only significant, but nevertheless, limited variation is heard in the lowest part. In several responses, the bass doubles the second part; however, there are places where other notes are substituted. I have endeavoured to show this by adding these extra notes in the bass part in the transcription. An interesting feature in the piece is that the caller also sings the leading part of the responses; hence, we can conclude that the song can be performed as a solo. A significant amount of assimilation occurs in the performance and this is obvious in the use of slurs and, in a few cases, apostrophes. The former can be described as assimilation by absorption and/or conflation while the latter is effected by omission. Mbopo is an initiation into womanhood and marriage. Akpan (1983) says mbopo maidens have their own singing groups as well as their own Ekong- Mbopo masquerade. He also goes on to state that the initiation involves circumcision, fattening and education. (11) A Mbopo Song Ikpa ukot ebe mi ayere mbat - My husband's shoes are dirty appioximate rhythms and pitches A i CA RESPON LL_ _ A _ ) II- kpa u- ko- t_e- be mi a- ye- re_m- bat 0 o t ___ ____._E e JSE - - O- fo- n_i- de- m_e- be mi a- ye- re_m- bat I- yo o o o o o o o,'o o ` ----- -:-; --:-^-t :</page><page sequence="18">150 Robert Kwami CALL: Ikpa ukot ebe mi ayere mbat My husband's shoes are dirty RESPONSE: 0 - o - o/E - e - e CALL: Ofon idem ebe mi ayere mbat My husband's shirt is dirty RESPONSE: Iyo - o - o - o - o - o - o This is another song from Mbribit. A 'father's girl' says that her husband's shoes and shirt are dirty. This means that she has not been properly trained to look after, and keep, a husband. A more accurate translation of the line: Ikpa ukot ebe mi ayere mbat is 'My husband's leather shoe is dirty'. The song was sung twice. It is in a fast declamatory style and it employs a speech-rhythm. Again, this is another example where the transcription is skeletal, a rough approximation of the performance. For example, the use of slurring of the words and the pitches and scooping are features which have not been accommodated. Three clear parts are discernible although the music was performed by four people. The leader who sings the calls also holds the top part in the responses; the two males sing the lowest part while the other female singer holds the inner part. Ignoring some of the complications highlighted in the transcription, the piece has a pentatonic melodic structure. Although sixths and thirds are employed in the harmonisation in the responses, the emphasis is clearly on fourths and fifths. The inner part is limited to three notes, the top part sings four notes, while the bottom part also sings three notes. No part sings all the five notes of the scale; from a melodic perspective, hocketting can be said to be a feature of the piece although this is rhythmically limited. Comparing the two responses, it is clear that the first two main notes of the second are the same as those used in the first; in this sense, the second response seems to expand on the first. 3.5. Adults' songs Traditional social, religious and cult groups for adults in the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States tend to be unisexually constituted. However, as Akpabot (1975) has stated, elderly women are sometimes given honorary status in some men's groups (such as Ekpo and Ekpe). Women sometimes form social clubs for social purposes in which music- making is important. Ebre and Iban Isong are examples of such powerful traditional women's societies. Although Ebre is a gentle women's dance its songs provide a rich source of social comment as this one: (12) An Ebre song Ino okop uyo nkpo - The thief has heard the shout I- noo- ko- p_u- yo_n- kpo_o- du- k_i- ko- to- so- ro 'kpe o- bo- p__e- yi- no- bo- p_u- ton</page><page sequence="19">Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria Ino okop uyo nkpo Oduk ikot osoro Akpe obop eyin iobop uton The thief has heard the shout And entered the bush to squat So he closed his eyes, closed his ears We see from the text of this song collected from Atai Essien that when the shout is raised to catch a thief, he runs to the bush and pretends that he was defecating at the time of the theft. Presumably the thief was not caught; but the finger pointed at a particular man whose alibi probably rested solely on his assertion that he was defecating when the crime was committed. So the illustrious Ebre group probably made up this song to broadcast their suspicions; this falls within the scope of allowable artistic licence in Annang culture. Like the call section of the previous example, this solo piece is entirely in free, irregular, metre. It is heard four times without a break, and in a declamatory style. The first note which is flattened appears only twice in the whole piece as do the lowest (dorian) and highest (mixolydian) notes. The scale used is heptatonic and, unlike some other scales that we have encountered in earlier examples, it contains all the steps between the dorian and mixolydian within a modal structure. Like Ebre, Iban Isong is another sharp vocal women's group to comment on topical and moral issues as is illustrated in the following song text: (13) An Iban Isong Song Ami mboufen ntie mbok eyen - I suffered and reared a child A L L I I L I L_ o.

Instead of typing she became pregnant She wants typing - o! 151 A</page><page sequence="20">152 Robert Kwami The song, also collected from Atai Essien, talks about the immoral behaviour of a schoolgirl. The girl refuses to get married because she is learning 'typing'. But instead of typing, she gets pregnant. The word 'typing' occurs in the Ibibio/Annang version and is obviously an example of language assimilation. The whole phrase Ika typing - o! reads better when translated as: 'She wants to learn typing - o!' A somewhat declamatory style is used by the lead cantor who takes on the role of the girl's mother while the chorus comments on the action. Unlike other examples in responsorial form, each section is comparatively long. The lead singer is joined by one other voice in parts in the calls. In the accompaniment, these three notes can be heard: t oj ? In the chorus, other singers join in to create a three-part harmonisation. There is a suggestion of polymodality through the choice of harmony notes in each vocal line. Combining the notes sung by all the parts, we get the following heptatonic scale: The piece is accompanied with drumming and dancing. The drumming commences after a few repetitions of the piece. At least two drums are used, one of which performs a master drum function. Most cult groups are exclusively for men. Of these, Ekpo societies, which have many varieties (see Akpan 1983), predominate. Literally, ekpo means 'ghost' and it is the manifestation of spirit beings in the physical world. Udom (1983) says one traditional function of Ekpo masquerades is the enforcement of law and order in traditional communities. Some of the song texts used by secret societies/cults, such as the following one, are not esoteric; but their uses and functions are governed by social conventions and this must not be ignored in performances of such music. (14) An Ekpo song Ekpo nyoho Obon obobom- Ekpo nyoho Chief of masquerades [No transcription attempted - see below] Ekpo nyoho Obon obobom Ekpo nyoho Chief of masquerades Utun iniehe enyin amono okpo usun The worm has no eye yet it sees the path isan Iso nte eka mkpa eyin Idem His face is like that of those going to the funeral of Idem's child Iso nte eka usoro ndo His face is like that of those going for a wedding Ekpo time edem ke ufok akananwan Ekpo stay back from an old woman's house</page><page sequence="21">Songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria Akananwan iniehe eyin uduadekpo The old woman has no child to bar Ekpo's way Ukite nana ado okpuho ama akem Look! the money was enough for the dowry ndo eyin owo Mben nno ekpo Ikot Abia But I gave it to the Ekpo of Ikot Abia Utun iniehe enyin amono okpo usun The worm has no eye yet it sees the path isan Ekpo nyoho Obon obobom Ekpo nyoho Chief of masquerades Ekpo mi - o [three times] My Ekpo - o [three times] Although this is an Ekpo song, it was given to me as an example of a minstrel's song; it was translated by Boniface Akpan. Ekpo Nyoho is a type of masquerade. An old woman accuses Ekpo of being responsible for her not marrying and having children, something which is generally socially undesirable - the Ekpo of Ikto Abia took her dowry money. This solo was performed prestissimo, in a highly declamatory and free style. It is in a through-composed form in which the dramatic connotations of the text are paramount, subsuming musical interests. The nature of the performance is such that a representation of the piece in conventional notation may create unwanted distortion. An interesting feature is the trill or tremolo on the final 'o'. 4. Conclusion A selection of songs from the Akwa Ibom and Cross River States of Nigeria have hereby been presented. These have included songs for babies, children, adolescents and adults; some of these songs have been performed by females or males. The content and subject matter of some songs relate, directly or indirectly, to the African story-telling tradition (1, 9 &amp; 10). Some of the children's songs (2, 3, 4) have an educational function while others have a philosophical-cum- moralistic import (6, 11, 12 &amp; 13). In the latter category are songs by women's groups which provide an outlet for social comment (11, 12 and 13). Two songs (10 &amp; 14) stand out in terms of their emotional content. In each case, the subject has experienced a misfortune: the orphan accused of murdering Ndo and the old woman who blames Ekpo for depriving her of progeny. Songs from the early part of the life cycle are based on aspects of enculturation (or the growing up process) (see, for example, Sloboda 1986). Whether dealing with masquerades or purely with entertainment, an element of moral or other educational concerns is evident in a number of examples. Although some of the songs were performed as solos (2, 7, 12 &amp; 14), other examples involve a group of people who, on occasion, engage in improvisation. Responsorial form is used arid, sometimes, this is combined with a variation and/or strophic structure. Formally, responsorial singing predominates (1, 3, 4, 10, 11 and 13), while the Western influences apparent 153</page><page sequence="22">154 Robert Kwami in the homophonic examples (2, 5, 6 &amp; 10) may relate to the heptatonic scales used. Most songs have a range of less than an octave. The smallest number of notes used in a song or vocal part is normally three (e.g. 1) while the widest range is a sixth. The harmonisations, between two and four part harmony, use different types of procedures - at the octave, in thirds and sixths; fourths and fifths; seconds and sevenths are also present. A variety of modal scales are used. These range from a trichordic song (1) to the heptatonic examples mentioned in the previous paragraph: there are also tetratonic (2, 3, 7, 9) [and the tune of (13)], pentatonic (8, 11), and hexatonic examples (12, 13). In addition, there are a number of songs which are so closely tied to the tonal inflections of the languages that it may be problematic and/or inadequate to represent them in conventional music notation (see for example 1, 5, 14). An added complication in the analyses concerns the attempt to separate the language and musical aspects of the songs. These two aspects are so inextricably linked that it may be helpful to study their interrelationship in cultures with tonal languages. In the present context, the orthography of the Annang, Efik, Ibibio and Oron languages has proved problematic because, in musical performance as well as in everyday speech, there is a marked degree of assimilation. Perhaps there is an advantage here for phonetic analyses; but more important perhaps, this highlights an advantage of cross-disciplinary studies and collaboration in African studies of this kind. One striking point is the reminder that we are dealing here with an oral- aural culture in which Western tools of analysis may not always be appropriate. More important, perhaps, is the fact that the collection represents a description of particular performances. The evidence of acculturation, particularly Western influences, may actually be more than has been suggested. Nevertheless, the overall message is that the songs demonstrate aspects of traditional African life. They constitute an avenue for music education and, at the same time, a vehicle for cultural continuity. REFERENCES Agawu, V.K. 1988a. Music in the funeral traditions of the Akpafu.
