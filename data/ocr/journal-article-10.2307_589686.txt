<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent theorizations of corporatism: reflections on a growth industry' Until this decade, corporatism was a term either largely restricted to the study of the history of ideologies and/or fascist regimes, or a popular (especially in the labour movement) term of denigration of trade union co-optation in state incomes policy or economic planning structures. As a social scientific term applied to certain developments or arrangements . , , . . . . . ln contemporary advanced caplta lSt socletles, corporatlsm was employed by a notably limited number of scholars. Only in the 1970S did we witness a veritable explosion of social scientific production which employs the term corporatism in the latter sense. This has occurred to such an extent that it is hardly incorrect to speak of corporatism as a major 'field of study' itself, with a spillover of usage of the term in the media and among political actors. Yet, the first thing that strikes one as one reads through the recent literature on modern corporatism is the profound lack of agreement on what the concept actually refers to. It is obvious that considerable confusion must attend a field in which the central concept is variously understood to connote a distinct economic system or mode of production (feudalism. capitalism, socialism . . . corporatism), a state form (parliamentarism, fascism . . . corporatism), and a system of interest intermediation (pluralism, syndicalism, monism . . . corporatism). This confusion must be compounded when, for instance, within the interest intermediation approach alone, one finds a range of theoretical and research practices which are at odds with one another, 'with respect to conceptual usage, substantive funding, causal reference or normative preference'.2 The view that the recent appear- ance of corporatism on the terminological stage of political science makes it 'somewhat premature to take its meaning for granted',3 may in this light be seen as both understatement and false optimism. For as the quantity of work on corporatism has expanded, it has been difficult to discern whether definitional convergence has really tended to outpace definitional refraction. Given this situation, there appears to be little basis for the belief that positive foundations have in fact been established for considering British .Journal of Sociology Volume3s Number 2 June I 980 (¢) R.K.P. 1980 ooo7 1315/80/3102-0159 $1.50/1 159 Lec) Panitch</page><page sequence="2">160 Leo Panitch corporatism as an alternative 'problematique' to pluralism4 or indeed anything else. This is not necessarily to be lamented. As Meier has written, '. . . there is no need of pressing different approaches into one common framework. However, it appears reasonable to me to try to be as explicit as possible concerning the basic underlying problem definitions and assumptions; only then can we hope to become aware of conceptual research progress, material implications of different investigations, and remaining points of theoretical and factual controversy worthwhile debating.'5 It is in this spirit that this paper is written. It seeks to cast a critical eye on this new field, to point out inconsistent definitions and usages, and, in particular, to focus on certain tendencies among the various recent theorizations which may impede fruitful study and foster illusions about corporatism. It is not intended to be a catalogue or a summary of the recent literature, but rather a reflection on central theoretical problems which appear to be at the core of the confusion that presently marks the field.6 The modern etymological origins of the term corporatism are found in those variants of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century social thought which rejected the theoretical and programmatic premises of both liberalism and Marxian socialism. Decrying on the one hand the individualism and competition of capitalism, and on the other the class conflict and socialist movements to which it gave rise, corporatist theorists contended that class harmony and organic unity were essential to society. Looking backwards to the mutual rights and obligations that presumably united the medieval estates, they proposed a social and political order based on functional socioeconomic organizations in civil society, operating largely autonomously in their respective fields, but united with each other and the state in sectoral and national decision- making bodies and committed to maintaining the functional hierarchy of an organic society. 7 Certainly from an analytic rather than a normative point of view, corporatist social thought, with its unwieldy assumptions of organic unity and class harmony, was never of much use. Moreover, its incorporation into fascist ideology and practice tended to indicate that the social harmony promulgated in corporatist theory could only be crudely approximated in practice by the use of state repression and force, primarily against the indigenous organizations of the working class. In capitalist societies that remained liberal democratic, however, it has been possible to discern not only continuing nuances of corporatist ideology, but also the development of certain political structures which in their operative premises and institutional form bear corporatist elements. In particular, the national economic planning and incomes policy bodies which have proliferated in Western Europe since the Second World War involve the institutionalized inte,,ration of trade unions and business associations with the state in terms of functional representation. These structures developed on a 'pragrnatic' basis and</page><page sequence="3">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refections on a growth industry 161 were by no means self-avowedly corporatist; they grew up alongside and in conjunction with the dominant representative system ot parliamentarism and interest group lobbying; and state coercion played a secondary, or at least 'background' role in their emergence. But the similarities between these bodies and those proposed by corporatist social thought were such that it was perhaps only a matter of time, once the pejorative association between fascism and corporatism wore off, before social scientists began to describe these bodies are quasi or neo- a corporatlst. , In so far as students of corporatism concentrated on examining the origins, dynamics, limitations and contradictions of these particular structures within advanced capitalist liberal democratic societies, there was much to be learned from their work. There has been an increasingly common tendency, however, to see these particular corporatist struc- tures, not as representing new partial elements within the existing econo- mic and political system, but, as corporatist ideology once claimed they would be, new political and/or economic systems in their own right. It shall be the central argument of this paper that at the root of much of the confusion which presently marks the study of modern corporatism, lies in the tendency to offer paradigmatic definitions of corporatism in ideal-typical terms, and at the level of total systems. These systems have never existed as described, but are logical constructs created to stand as alternatives to capitalism or pluralism or parliamentarism. This is a very different form of abstraction than that of abstracting the basic proper- ties of a given existing structure, removing the historical and extraneous to get at the basic relationship which may be said to define the structure. Instead, we have seen with regard to corporatism a form of'abstraction' which proceeds by expansion rather than contraction, i.e. that on the basis of particular structures, creates a definition for a whole system, whether of interest, inter-mediation or state form or mode of produc- tion. Although it is usually immediately admitted that a full corporatist system nowhere exists, and that one is dealing with questions more or less, of mixtures or articulations with other systems, there is nevertheless the presumption- rooted in the definition itself- that corporatism has it within its nature to become a full system. In order to demonstrate this one would need a dynamic historical theory which would establish the conditions for the spread of corporatist structures throughout the whole system. Such a theory has not been offered. The result of this 'Macro- Gestalt' of corporatism,9 however, is that research is oriented away from the questions of why corporatism has developed in particular sectors and amongst particular groups, or classes, the role it plays and the contradictions it introduces as such in maintaining the existing system of interest mediation, state form, or mode of production.</page><page sequence="4">162 II Leo Panitch The grandest, and the weakest, of approaches to corporatism as a total system is that which understands by the term an alternative economic system to capitalism and socialism. Currently, this approach is most conspicuously espoused in the corporatism field byJack Winkler, who defines corporatism 'as an economic system in which the state directs and controls predominately privately-owned business according to four principles; unity, order, nationalism and success . . . stripped to its essentials, corporatism is principally defined by one particularly important qualitative change, the shift from a supportive to a directive role for the state in the economy'.'° The key factor underlying a transition from capitalism to corporatism is industrial concentration which 'makes the notion of a "market" and of "competition" within that market unreal'. Given this development, since deconcentration is 'unlikely' and corporate self-regulation 'untenable', state control of profit becomes inevitable. 'For the state to tolerate (and in some cases to sponsor) concentration to this level and still allow profit maximization would be to license corporate plunder, to issue a permit to hold the nation to ransom. This is an intolerable situation, not just in political terms, but economically to the other consumer and supplies firms of the dominants. . . . The choice is state control of profit." ' It will be seen immediately that there are certain problems here. First of all, it is clear that the conception of capitalism involved is one derived from neo-classical economics, entailing not only an image of the laissez- faire state (amended to speak of a supportive role for the state rather than a non-existent one), but also of perfect inter-firm competition with unrestricted access within each particular market. As Clifton has shown, the theory of imperfect competition is based on using perfect competition as a benchmark, 'a standard of competition against which all other varieties of capitalist economy that arise in the course of history are measured. . . . As a result the development and continued growth of large firms in the economy are necessarily interpreted as a progressive deviation away from competitive conditions. a 12 Apart from the untenable assumption that capitalism exists in the purest form at its earliest stage, rather than like any mode of production unfolding over time (as is appreciated by the theories of organized capitalism and state monopoly capitalism), this conception of capitalism also involves a restricted definition of competition which organized capitalism and state monopoly theories also share. If the idea of competition as being restricted to price competition amongst a multitude of firms within an industry is abandoned, we can see that modern capitalism on the basis of large corporations remains competitive in the sense of competition among corporate giants over rates of profit in an era of finance capital when capital mobility, internationally and inter-industry, is greater than ever before.</page><page sequence="5">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refections on a growth industry 163 The structural condition of free capital mobility renders competition among firms in the dominant corporate sector more abstract, since it is more general or economy-wide in nature. The abstract character is evident in the fact that it is now direct competition among cohesive sums of self-expanding finance that dominates the economic process, rather than competition among producers of soap on the one hand and producers of books on the other. Because production for each firm is general, firms are directly competing with a much larger number of firms than those in any one of its operating divisions. Further, the tremendous number of commodities produced by each firm and the dominant strategy of growth through product innovation add enormous complexity and changeability to the competitive interrelationships among firms. 13 But if Winkler's theory of the operative dynamics of modern capitalism is faulty, we find as regards the corporatist economic system that is allegedly replacing it, we have not a faulty theory but none at all. It is not the economic rules of operation of the corporatist system that provide the basis for Winkler's definition, but rather state intervention into a capitalist economy according to certain policy goals established by the state itself. It is this autonomous role for the state that makes this corporatism 'fascism with a human face'. Apart from the fact that this revives the erroneous notion of fascism as an economic system, rather than a particular kind of capitalist state form, it also entails a view of the state as a neutral and independent subject, 'an anthropomorphic superperson' 14 ultimately free of class determination or even determination by the mode of production in which it operates. In any case, Winkler fails completely to establish that the state intervention that is constitutive of his corporatist model takes place on the basis of economic criteria that are distinctive from those of capitalism. AsJohn Westergaard has already pointed out in an outstanding critique: 'The four guiding "principles" of corporatist policy set no prescriptions for allocation of resources. They are empty vessels into which this, that or another formula for investment and production may be poured. The formula could well be that characteristic of capitalism, under which resources are allocated in general to achieve long-run profit maximization: corporatist concerns for "unity" and "order", "nation" and "success" need in no significant way clash with the general use of profit yardsticks.' As for the principles of distribution in Winkler's model, they too 'merely echo those at work in the capitalist system which corporatism is supposed to be replacing'.'5 The most significant passage in Winkler's work, the one in which his definition of corporatism would ultimately have to rest or fall, is to be found in a footnote'6 where he tells us that 'surplus-value, exchange value and accumulation would not be significantly altered by a move towards corporatism. The law of value, commodity production, appropriation, entrepreneurship and freedom</page><page sequence="6">164 Leo Panztch of contact would'. Unfortunately, we are not offered definitions of these terms and on the basis of currentlyaccepted ones, it is difficult, to say the least, to see how one can have surplus value without the law of value, exchange value without commodity production, accumulation without . . approprlatlon. Winkler does not claim that his ideal-typical model is a description of any concrete society, but is rather 'a mechanism for generating predictions about future developments'. 1 7 But in so far as the ideal type is generated in large part on the basis of his reading of developments in the real world, its validity as a predictive model, must depend on historical and contemporary evidence of accumulating trends. And when we come to examine the empirical evidence for corporatism that Winkler offers, we can see the particular weakness of his argument. This evidence is drawn exclusively from the British context, and the two main illustrations of directive state control over privately-owned business adduced are profit and price controls associated with incomes policy and the system of planning agreement instituted by the Labour Government of 1 9 7 4. Yet as Winkler himself demonstrates, the Planning Agreements System was 'severely emasculated' shortly after Labour took power. (The one Agreement in the private sector merely legitimated subsidization of a firm unable to compete- Chrysler. ) As for the selective profit and price controls associated with incomes policy, the vast weight of evidence on the largely symbolic attributes of these controls as 'quid pro quo' for effective wage restraint 18 makes their characterization, without detailed evidence, as directive controls which change the nature of the economic system clearly untenable. And even if these controls were effective, to generalize from the relatively few dominant corporations they touch to the entire economic system is 'definition by expansion' carried to the extreme. In so far as one can find effective directive state control in Winkler's own evidence, it is the context of his footnoted evidence that while the 'planning agreement system has been considerably weakened, wage controls have been rather promptly and easily reinstituted' under the Labour Government. '9 As a basis for prediction then, Winkler's own evidence would seem to suggest above all the distinct limits to state control on profits even under an avowedly interventionist government. Winkler seems, at least implicitly, to be aware of the quantitative aspect of these limits, that is, that the expansion of state ownership of the economy, however necessary a large public sector may be for modern capitalism, cannot go so far as to displace private ownership without a substantial political fissure induced by the active resistance of the bourgeoisie. But Winkler fails to recognize that there are also qualitative limits to state intervention. State economic planning in capitalist societies, with or without planning agreements, is primarily a forecasting exercise. Selective interventions of a more positive kind, which actually affect the structure of capital in particular sectors (although mainly through</page><page sequence="7">Recent theorizations of corporatism: ref ections on a growth industry 165 financial inducements rather than directive controls) are as Poulantzas put it, 'constituted as ad-hoc tinkering with conditions already laid down by the process of valorization of capital', while the 'hard core of capitalist relations of production' remain subject either to the process of 'non-decision making' or to active intervention in maintaining them as far as the state is concerned.20 The distinction that Winkler makes between qualitative and quantitative intervention as marking the transition from capitalism to corporatism, appears untenable as a basis for prediction. The definition of corporatism as state intervention and control is of course far removed from the term's historical origins in corporatist ideology where corporatism was primarily conceived as a system of functional representation designed to foster class harmony. To be sure, Winkler does point to the development of new political structures which have a good deal in common with corporatism in this sense, although these play a secondary, derivative part in his approach. Winkler argues that the corporatist state is subject to 'a twin administrative dilemma: how to deal with conflict of interest in a system where there is supposed to be one over-riding interest and how to avoid manifestations of coercion where people are supposed to cooperate spontaneously'.2' This is indeed the old problem of corporatist ideology. For Winkler these dilemmas are basically resolved: (a) by the state moving away from open parliamentary rule-making towards delegated and enabling legislation so that state actions are not recorded publicly except in the vaguest form; and (b) by the state operating, in terms of administrative enforcement, through personnel and organizations which are not nominally part of the state apparatus. Winkler's treatment of recent political developments in this respect is not without its insights. Yet a number of points must be made in respect of them. First of all, Winkler identifies as corporatist a very broad range of semi-public institutions, which, while reflective of administrative decentralization, in no sense all involve representatives of functional interest associations or the interaction of these associations in decision- making.22 Moreover, his argument that this form of corporatism entails 'administration without bureaucracy' cannot be sustained. Delegated and enabling legislation is hardly a new development in parliamentary regimes, nor has it historically entailed a decline in the size and role of bureaucracy, but rather its expansion. Moreover, in so far as the state is seen as imposing its policy directives on private associations, especially business, it is inconceivable that this could be done without an autonomous bureaucratic arm with independent access to information and capable of supervising the operations of capital. Most important, the semi-public bodies that regulate private industry have generally been created with the purpose of obviating business fears of state control.23 Winkler clearly believes that these bodies conceal from business contentious state activities, but he offers little evidence to show how the</page><page sequence="8">166 Leo Panitch bourgeoisie is so easily duped, or to counter the 'captive agency' argument.24 And since Winkler's definition of corporatism rests not on the existence of such mediatory institutions between the state and civil society but on state directive control over private capital through them, this is no small point. Finally, although Winkler distinguishes this 'corporatism without bureaucracy' from fascist corporatism as 'the ultimate bureaucracy', he seems to believe that liberal democracy is inevitably abrogated in both forms. This is not the resul t of the need to repress openly the subordinate classes, however, but rather because extensive state control of the economy is inconsistent with the procedures of legal enactment. Flexibility is all and, via discretionary formulae, enabling acts and state financial control over private groups, the rule of law is destroyed under a patina of legality and formal participation. 'The corporatist purpose is to have simultaneously the substance of state control and the appearance of democracy.'25 In this way, Winkler takes a position, which is in fact extremely common in the corporatist literature (and is shared extensively by the Marxist state monopoly capitalism theorists), that involves assuming that capital concentration and state intervention are incompatible with a liberal democratic polity of any substance. Ignored here is the fact that the extension of bourgeois democracy to the subordinate classes in the form of free association and mass suffrage coincided historically with the concentration of capital and the growing role of an active capitalist state. Capitalism was liberal long before it was democratic, and its democratic elements were introduced far more as a result of working class struggles than of the free market economy. Lurking in the corporatism literature, is the old saw (mostly commonly associated with the work of Hayek) that a polity of democratic liberty is only consistent with 'pure capitalism' as defined by the theory of perfect competition. There are indeed real dangers in corporatism but I am hardly convinced that the best way to approach them is through this form of economic reductionism. III An approach to corporatism which is much stronger than Winkler's, and has had much more influence, at least outside of Britain, is that of Philippe Schmitter.26 Defining corporatism as a 'system of interest intermediation' (alongside pluralism, syndicalism and monism), this approach confines corporatism to a political subsystem and thereby avoids the pitfalls of extrapolating corporatist developments tO fundamental changes in the mode of production. Yet it also exhibits, even at this level, unwarranted expansive tendencies precisely because it includes all group-state relations under an ideal-typical definitional rubric.</page><page sequence="9">Recent theorizations of corporatism: retections on a growth industry 167 Schmitter's ideal-typical definition of corporatism is constructed explicitly as a paradigmatic alternative to pluralism. Pluralism can be defined as a system of interest intermediation in which the constituent units are organized into an unspecified number of multiple, voluntary, competitive, nonhierarchically ordered and self-determined (as to type or scope of interest) categories which are not specially licensed, recognized, subsidized, created or otherwise controlled in leadership selection or interest articulation by the state and which do not exercise a monopoly of representational activity . . Wlt ln t elr respectlve categorles. In contrast: Corporatism can be defined as a system of interest intermediation in which the constituent units are organized into a limited number of singular, compulsory, noncompetitive, hierarchically ordered and functionally differentiated categories, recognized or licensed (if not created) by the state and granted a deliberate representational monopoly within their respective categories in exchange for observing certain controls on their selection of leaders and articula- tion of demands and supports.27 In terms of its descriptive adequacy in relation to interest grourstate relations in advanced capitalist societies, Schmitter's definition of corporatism has much to recommend it as against pluralism. However, the very fact that the concept of corporatism is constructed by Schmitter as a polar opposite to pluralism leads it to replicate many of the theoretical inadequacies of the latter. This point has already been made by Nedelman and Meier: '. . . The very fixation of the concept of corporatism with the previously "dominant" model of pluralism contains a number of pitfalls. By taking over the dimensions of the latter - such as "numbers of organizations", "intra-sectional monopoly of interest representations", "degree of competition between the organizations" and so on- and just changing or inverting the empirical values of these dimensions or variables, one risks the same conceptual and theoretical difficulties already connected with the previous utilization.'28 At a minimum, by leaving out of the definition the economic system in which corporatism (and pluralism) are located, there is not only an ahistorical quality to the definition, but little theoretical invitation to challenge pluralism's assumption of state neutrality between the groups or to address the differential power position of the groups themselves in the society. A further example of the kind of problems that definitions based on formal parallelism between ideal-typical constructs may lead to, can be seen when we examine the various sub-types of the systems of interest intermediation Schmitter introduces. He argues that there are two such sub- types of corporatism: 'societal' and 'state' . The former is</page><page sequence="10">Leo Panitch 168 characterized by spontaneous gradual development and consensual and voluntarist arrangements (as in the 'advanced capitalist, organized democratic welfare state'); the latter entails state creation or imposition over the groups and control over them.29 His subsequent assignation ot state and societal sub-types not only to corporatism, but also pluralism (and syndicalism) produces severe conceptual problems, however. His argument is that the origins of pluralism or syndicalism may lie in state creation or inducement.30 But apart from the fact that if the state sets the system in motion, it is most likely to maintain continued effective influence over the groups, if not actual control, the distinction could not pertain to the actual operation of these sub-types, for if we had state pluralism (or state syndicalism) in practice, this would not be consistent with Schmitter's own definition of these types. State pluralism actually 'embedded in a political system' would be a contradiction in terms. This warns against formal and abstract definitions which are constructed not out of concrete analyses of actual historical examples, but out of ideal- typical combinations. Anything can be cooked out of such recipes, but how much of it is edible is another question. These problems mainly pertain to what Schmitter himselfadmits 31 iS the 'static' and 'disembodied' nature of his definitional approach, however, and may be overcome in historical and empirical analysis. Indeed it must be said immediately that in Schmitter's own hands these problems have been attenuated or avoided in his actual analysis of the development of corporatist structures, where he introduces 'certain basic imperatives or needs of capitalism to reproduce the conditions for its existence and continually to accumulate further resources', in a way quite uncharacteristic of pluralist theory. He argues that 'the decay of pluralism and its gradual displacement by societal corporatism can be traced primarily to the imperative necessity for a stable, bourgeois- dominant regime, due to processes of concentration of ownership, competition between national economies, expansion of the role of public policy and rationalization of decision-making within the state to associate or incorporate subordinate classes and status groups more closely with the political process'.32 Not surprisingly, therefore, he has outlined his search for an alternative 'problematique' to pluralism not only in his constructed model of corporatism pewr se, but by relating it to broader theories of society such as structural functionalism, political economy and historical materialism. He clearly favours the latter, although:he narrowly conceives it in terms of the Austro- German school of Marxist revisionism to the exclusion of most contemporary theorists in the Marxist tradition.33 A much more serious product of Schmitter's definitional approach to corporatism, which has not been resolved in his own substantive analysis, is the fact that it is founded entirely in terms of relations between singular groups and the state. This leaves out the critical dimension of cooperative mutual interaction among the groups</page><page sequence="11">Recent theorizations oJcorporatism: reJ£ections on agrowth industry 169 themselves in corporatist arrangements. As Lehmbruch has put it: '. . . Iiberal corporatism should not be confounded with simply more consultation and cooperation with organized interest groups which is, of course, common in all constitutional democracies with a highly developed capitalist economy. The distinguishing trait of liberal corporatism is a high degree of collaboration among the groups themselves in the shaping of economic policy.'34 By leaving this dimension out, Schmitter's approach takes on a similaritywith the kind of counter-pluralist argument put forward by Theordore Lowi with respect to the United States, whereby interest group-state relations are characterized by segments of the state being captured or colonized by particular groups. This stands in sharp contrast to the kind of interactive policy making at the summit among socioeconomic producer groups characteristic of corporatist structures in Western Europe. Schmitter himself distinguishes Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands from the United States (as well as France, Great Britain and Ireland) in terms of the former having adopted 'internal "social peace" treaties between peak associations of employers and workers in the 1 930S and then move[d] rapidly towards generalized societal corporatism in the 1940S and 1950S', while the latter 'have proved consistently more resistant to the blandishments of corporatism'.35 But in terms of 'generalized societal corporatism', the interactive dimensions among groups at the level of the state characteristic of the social peace treaty between labour and capital associations is not shown to be matched in other group-state relations. This leads directly to the cental criticism to be made of Schmitter's approach - his adoption of a 'group-theoretical' rather than a 'class- theoretical' approach in his definition, along much the same lines as pluralism. This allows him to cast his corporatist net much more widely (i.e. include more groups) than he would otherwise, but it has, by that very fact, serious disadvantages. One ofthe great putative advantages of the corporatist over pluralist approach is that by using it one need not reduce all group interests, group conflicts and group-state relations to the same salience and the same plane. As an ideology corporatism has focused not on all groups and cleavages, but rather as Schmitter has himself affirmed, quoting Madison, on that 'most common and durable source of faction . . . the various and unequal distribution of property'. Schmitter's representative examples of corporatism in practice are mainly those in which capital and labour groups are centrally involved and his own explanatory hypotheses regarding the development of corporatism indicate a 'class- theoretical' approach . That is, he specifically relates the origins of corporatism to the 'basic institutions of capitalism and the class structure of property and power engendered by it', and distinguishes between the origins of state and societal sub-types in terms of 'the institutional development and international context of capitalism, especially as they affect the pattern of conflicting class</page><page sequence="12">Leo Panitch 170 interests'. His 'core' distinction between the origins of the two rests on 'structural conduciveness' given by 'delayed, dependent capitalist development and non-hegemonic class relations in the case of state corporatism and advanced, monopoly or concentrated capitalist development and collaborative class relations in the case of societal corporatism'.36 All of this is not reflected, however, in the 'group- theoretical' orientation his ideal typical definition of corporatism shares with pluralism. Or is it ? Schmitter's definition, like most others, stresses the functional basis of representation in corporatism. This would appear to refer to the constituent units of corporatism as those interest groups arising directly out of the social division of labour, and out of which classes are in large part formed. As Morris and Rapp have suggested in applying Schmitter's definition: We assume here that Schmitter is referring to the various economic functional sectors such as subsistence agriculture, industrial- manufacturing, commercial, agribusiness, empleados (private and public), and professional groupings. The corporate definition holds that interests emanating from these sectors are represented via specific organizations, and that the particular organizations face little or no competition within their respective sectors. Moreover, the organizations operate only within their own spheres of functional specialization and maintain/recruit their rank and file through rules and regulations that require membership in order to hold a job or participate in benefits. Under these conditions, the number of organizations should closely parallel the number of viable economic/functional sectors in the society.37 Yet, it would appear that Schmitter's actual understanding of the constituent units of corporatism is in fact broader than Morris and Rapp assume. For in his subsequent article, Schmitter indicates that the constituent units involved in systems of interest intermediation are the 'highly organized and specialized representatives of class, sectoral, regional, sexual and generational interests . . . complexes of specialized associations often bypassing if not boycotting, more traditional and more general partisan and legislative structures of articulation and aggregation'.38 The various modes, it should be noted, are not distinguished on the basis of the different constituent units (for instance with class or sector representatives assigned to the corporatist system) but rather in terms of the different ways in which all these constituent units are formed, structured and interact with the state. Although Schmitter readily admits that any given Western society exploits a mixed system of interest intermediation, and that 'different interest sectors may be organized in quite different ways', he does not indicate that the corporatist mode is likely to be more salient or most suitable to any one</page><page sequence="13">Recent theorizati()n.s otcorporatism: ret!ections on agrowth industry 171 of these sectors. Seen in this light, with a tendential possibility that sexual, regional and generational interest groups are as likely to be corporatized as class or sectoral groups based on economic function in the division of labour, it would appear that the meaning of'functional' in Schmitter's corporatist definition has taken on a broader, and less common, meaning. It appears that having been challenged by Nedelman and Meier39 that it be openly acknowledged 'that only occupational and economic organizations are considered' as constituent units of corporatism, Schmitter backed away, in light of their criticisms, from his definition of interest groups in the corporatist paradigm as 'functionally specific', a tempting step since this further established the inverted parallel with pluralism. If this speculation is correct, Schmitter has erred in doing so. At least it would be necessary to offer detailed historical and contemporary evidence on the spread of corporative modes to non- economic/functional groups, which has not been offered. Of course it is hardly necessary to claim, in restricting the constituent units of corporatism to socioeconomic producer groups, that other groups may not affect economic (or other) decisions. This is not excluded in so far as socioeconomic producer groups are not necessarily seen as monopolizing all economic decision making. How can Schmitter's 'group-theoretical' definition be made consistent with his own class-theoretical analytic framework, once the precise meaning of functional groups (i.e. those based on the social division of labour) is abandoned ? It can, but only at considerable cost to the value of his broader analytic framework. First of all, although Schmitter does not define what he means by 'class', he implies at one point that he sees 'the class structure of property and power' simply in terms of 'inequality of distribution'.40 If this is so, then the unique interrelationship that structures class groups, which is a product oftheir contradictory relations inproduction, would be easily overlooked. It becomes easier to put unions and employers, consumers and taxpayers on the same plane, and miss the specific nature of corporatism, both as ideology and as structure, as a response to the inevitable expression of class conflict in capitalist society. Although this conflict is necessarily expressed in the sphere of distribution as well, the distributional struggle is inseparable from relations between the classes in the actual production process. Secondly, it should be noted that the 'class-theoretical' analyses that Schmitter employs, and which I have quoted, pertain to the origins of corporatism. They are not made much use of in his description or analysis of the structure and functioning of generalized societal corporatism. In the case of state corporatism, associated with fascist or authoritarian dependent capitalist regimes, he appears much more interested in corporatism's relation to 'specific class interests'. This is</page><page sequence="14">Leo Panitch 172 perhaps why he finds Schonfield's Modern Capitalism so 'magisterial' a treatment of societal corporatism, despite its own systematic neglect (whatever its other virtues) of the question of bourgeois class domination in relation to the capitalist state. Schmitter, to be sure, is much more aware of this dimension, and seeks to add to Schonfield a more explicit discussion '. . . of prior class consciousness and intensity of class antagonisms.' But this pertains, as Schmitter makes clear, to 'the emergence of societal corporatism' again.4' Hence the use of 'prior'. The reason for this disjuncture between concern with class analysis in examining the origins of societal corporatism and its absence in examining in actual operation, appears to lie in Schmitter's more recently expressed argument against the assumption of structural functionalism, political economy and historical materialism, that changes in the mode of interest representation are primarily the product or reflection of prior and independent changes in economic and social structure.... For the purposes of understanding initial associational responses, this economism-societalism may be appropriate, but once the new collective actors begin to acquire resources and organizational properties of their own and once the state has expanded the scope and volume of its policy interventions, the mode of interest intermediation may be molded 'from within' and 'from above', so to speak, in relative independence from the conditions of civil society, and even in disregard for the preferences and interests of the individuals and firms, sectors, classes and so on whose interests are supposedly being represented.42 This goes as far in dislocating interest groups from their social base as does Winkler in treating the state's 'relative' autonomy as in substance amounting to total autonomy from civil society and the balance of class forces within it. And it is this kind of posited disjuncture between groups and their membership, this kind of reification of the 'organization', which must be the basis for the absence of class analysis in Schmitter's approach to corporatism as a functioning structure. It is also the basis for positing, as Schmitter does, the stability of societal corporatism. For once one abandons the assumption of underlying social harmony which characterizes corporatist ideology, and if one rules out the direct role of state coercion in the 'societal corporatism' of liberal democracies, one can only see corporatist structures as inherently stable if one assumes that interest associations do not in fact represent their members' interests. This is a curious assumption to see developed in the late 1970S, after a decade in which rank-and-file militancy has profoundly affected union organizations throughout Western Europe and shaken severely the stability of corporist structures. It has been the continuing linkage between unions and their members, and the continuing articulation by business associations of capital's interests that, in the context of the considerable</page><page sequence="15">Recent theorizations of corporatism: reJ£ections on a growth industry 173 class conflict in Western Europe in the late 1960S and 1970S, has made the 'affluent society' and 'end of ideology' theses look so jaded and worn. In the absence ofthe fundamental class consensus posited by such theories, and the absence of the kind of severe disarticulation between groups and their members assumed by Schmitter, the stability of corporatist structures will depend on the state forcibly breaking the autonomous and indigenous character of the groups. Thi$ coercive dynamic contained in corporatism, based on its need to suppress the continuing expression of class struggle in capitalist society, is precisely the factor which speaks against those who would see it as the new avenue of stability for liberal democratic advanced capitalism. IV In earlier work I have tried to locate the development of corporatism within liberal democracy in contrast with its association in the context of fascism with the outright abrogation of liberal democracy.43 As a minimal definition I have suggested that corporatism could be seen in this context as a political structure within advanced capitalism which integrates organized socioeconomic producer groups through a system of representation and cooperative mutual interaction at the leadership level and mobilization and social control at the mass level. Seen in this way, corporatism is understood as an actual political structure, not an ideology. Certain ideologies, and not necessarily corporatist ones (e.g. social democracy) may be facilitative to the establishment of corporatist structures, but ideas need to be distinguished from actual forms and processes. In addition, the political structure itself is both specific and partial. It is specific in the sense that it involves: (a) a linkage between the state and functional groups constituted by institutionalized representation in public policy making; (b) interaction among the groups themselves in this process (in contrast with the one-to-one relationship between interest groups and the state normally constitutive of pressure group politics); and (c) an element of state control over the groups whereby their autonomy is limited and they are employed as agencies of mobilization or administration for state policy. The corporatist political structure is partial in the sense that it does not displace parliamentary representation, bureaucratic administration and interest group lobbying, but exists alongside them, and is in many ways interwoven with them. Moreover, corporatist political structures do not appear to extend to all interest group-state relations. Their establishment and functioning mainly pertains to economic policy-making and it is those associations which are based directly on the social division of labour that are drawn into such structures. More specifically, it is the interest associations of business and labour, representing directly the central actors in the balance of class forces in advanced capitalist societies, which are the core</page><page sequence="16">Leo Panitch 174 constituent elements, alongside the state, of corporatist political structures. It should be stressed that this descriptive approach to corporatism in advanced capitalist liberal democracies does not assume equivalence of power or influence between the classes or the vroups based on them, nor the neutrality of the state vis-a-vis them. Nor does it assume that corporatist political structures are inherently stable. On the contrary, by situating corporatism explicitly within the parameters of advanced . . . . . . . . n . caplta lSt soclety, lt lnvltes lnvestlgatlon ot t le manner ln w ]1C. ] corporatist structures reflect, mediate or modify the domination of capital and the way they are themselves subject to the contradictions of capitalist society, not least as they are concretely embodied in continuing class struggle. In terms of its origins, corporatism in advanced liberal democracies appears to be associated with the attempt to contain the political and economic strength of the working class. In particular, the working class political victory on full employment at the end of World War Two had the affect of exacerbating capitalism's economic contradictions by increasing working class industrial strength in terms of wage pressure on profits (since the drag on militancy which the reserve army of labour otherwise maintained was attenuated). Corporatist structures, in the form of economic planning and incomes policy bodies, involved the integration of trade unions in economic policy making in exchange for their incorporation of capitalist growth criteria in union wage policy and their administration of wage restraint to their members. It was not state intervention in general that gave rise to corporatist structures. The associations of business interests with the making of state economic policy is a long-standing and general phenomenon of capitalist societies, from which labour was largely excluded until relatively recently despite their ancient political demands for entry. What is particularly distinctive about certain forms of state intervention, and why they may be called corporatist, is that they involve organized labour in institutionalized representation and administration of state policy, so that the functional interest groups of business and labour interact at the level of the state. The timing and extent of the institutionalization of corporatist structures in different societies appears to be directly associated with the economic strength of the union movement and its degree of centralization, the political influence social democracy has both in the labour movement and the state, and the extent to which national policies of wage restraint are central elements in the state's attempt to cope with the inflationary tendencies and increased international competition that attend the advanced capitalist economy. But the centrality of organized labour in corporatist structures does not itself say anything about their degree of influence in these structures, much less their domination of them. As I have tried to show before in studying the operation of these structures, not only does the advice and</page><page sequence="17">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refections on a growth industry 175 'expertise' of business representation have greater bearing in tllese structures than that of trade unions, but the state's role in tllese structures is independently determined by its need to foster e(onomi( growth within the context of facilitating capital accumulation. Although the extent to which this is the case varies with the balance of class forces in difFerent societies, there is generally a marked imbalance betweerl union representational ineffectiveness in terms of policy output on the one hand and their effective legitimation of state policy not only in general terms, but in the concrete material form of wage restraint, on the other. It is precisely this imbalance, however, that constitutes the contradiction of corporatist structures in liberal democracies. For in so far as unions remain indigenous organizations of the working c lass, they arc open to and themselves embody the continuing class struggle in capitalist society. Eventual outbursts of rnilitarl( y in the forTn ol unofficial strikes or the election of new union leaders leads the unions, at least temporarily, to (lisengage from active cooperation in corporatist structures. Hence the structures' instability. And in this context, we have seen in the late 1960S and early 1970S attempts to reinfor(e corporatist structures by the use of state coercion, vis-a-vis the unions. This involve s not an attempt to break the unions as organizations and repla(e thenl t)y state bodies, as in fascism, but an attempt to require and back by statt sanctions union discipline over the rank and file. This reintro(luc es tht old question of whether the class harmony sought by corpor atist structures is ultimately conditional upon the use of force and the (lire(t interposition of the state itself between the working class and its own organizations. The fact that these efforts have been largely unsuccessful, given working class determination to maintain freedom of association and the reluctance of the state and the capitalist class to abandon it, suggests that corporatism within the context of liberal democracy Tnust remain marked by a continuing element of instability. This limits it.s salience and determines its location as a partial structure within thc broader political system. The argument presented in this section, although reformulated here, is not a new one on my part. I have presented it only to contrast it explicitly with other recent approaches to corporatism which have had considerable influence, and which can be sharply difFerentiated from an approach to corporatism as a partial structure within advanced capitalism precisely by ignoring its specific limitations and . . contrac lctlons. If the argument presented to this point is at all correct, it suggests that corporatism is primarily about state-induced collaboration. Above all else, it is a political structure designed to integrate the organized working class in the capitalist state. Such an approach to modern corporatism can be justified on etymological, descriptive, analytic and explanatory grounds. Etymologically, it reflects the original meaning of</page><page sequence="18">176 Leo Panitch corporatism as it emerged in European social thought, the similarities with which is presumably the reason these new structures are called corporatist at all. (It does this in two senses: it is consistent with the original view of the constituent units of society as functional producer groups ;44 and it is consistent with the original significance of corporatism as an ideology designed to secure class harmony in the face of class conflict). Descriptively, as I have already indicated, this approach to modern corporatism is consistent with the empirical evidence of most students in the field, which is markedly concentrated on the corporatization of trade unions and employers associations, and particularly the former. Analytically, it facilitates comparison between the consultation and cooperation characteristic of state-interest group relations in all liberal democracies, and the interaction among the groups themselves as well as with the state which is distinctive of corporatism, and which follows from the fact that the classes upon which these groups are based are constituted in terms of a contradictory relation to one another. And this approach to corporatism can be justified on explanatory grounds in that it links the definition of the concept to the class-theoretical historical materialist framework, to which a great many, if not most, of the recent theorists of corporatism are self- avowedly partial. It should be stressed that in calling for a 'class-theoretical' rather than a 'group-theoretical' approach to the definition of corporatism, I am not suggesting that all interest groups can in some sense be reduced to classes or class fractions. This would simply be turning pluralism on its head. On the contrary, it is my contention that corporatism is specific to those groups which are class based. Other groups not founded on the social division of labour, or at least related to it only indirectly and through several mediations, such as issue-oriented groups, ideological groups, groups based on regional, sexual or generational bases, or groups based exclusively on the sphere of distribution such as consumers and tax-payers, will not be found to be among the principal constituent units of corporatist structures. The difference between the close relations which singular interest groups have with the state in all liberal democracies on the one hand, and the systematic interaction among the socioeconomic producer groups themselves as well as with the state which is distinctive of corporatism, follows from the fact that the major classes upon which functional groups are based are constituted in terms of a contradictory relation to one another. Wage labour and capital, workers and capitalists, trade unions and employers associations can only be understood in te-rms of the structural and historical relationship that determines their mutual behaviour and existence, in terms of the way they directly condition one another. Although all social groups may be said to be inter-dependent, this is true only at a general and abstract level and is only evinced in their actual behaviour in a highly mediated</page><page sequence="19">Recent theorizations of corporatism: reJ£ections on a growth industry 177 way or in very particular situations. The degree of interaction between groups in relation to the state is reflective of this difference. But what about the distinction so often made in corporatist literature between sectoral and socioeconomic ( i . e. class) functional groups ? Certainly, in corporatist ideology, and in the formal structures of avowedly corporatist states, the constituent units of corporatism are seen as those groups based on functional economic sectors (i.e. branches of industry, commerce, agriculture, the professions, etc.) and which include as members all those engaged in a sector's activity. Yet, at least as applied to liberal democracies, the organizational distinction between class and sector is a false one. A singular group which claims to speak for the interests of a whole industrial or commercial sector is almost invariably an association of firms in that sector, wherein the owner/managers/employers in that sector are represented, but not the non-owners/workers/employees. These are themselves organized into separate organizations of trade unions or employee associations, or not organized into functional groups at all. Thus, industrial or commercial sectors are not themselves 'group-homogeneous', so that they cut across class lines, but are themselves either associationally divided along class lines or only the dominant class in the sector is organized at all. (Of course, both capital and labour may be further divided in any given sector, with separate organizations, for instance, for large and small firms, or separate trade unions, often organized in accordance with occupational differentiation among the workers. ) Sectors which don't fit this pattern are those which are indeed largely class homogeneous, as well as organizationally homogeneous, in terms of the social division of labour. Such sectors are those in which the traditional petite bourgeoisie are dominant, as is often the case with agriculture and the legal profession. To the extent that corporatist structures involve such sectoral associations, this does not provide evidence of sectoral in addition to class representation, but rather of the corporatization of petit bourgeois socioeconomic producer groups. When we speak of socioeconomic producer groups as the functional groups of corporatist structures, we do not mean that these groups express the corporate interests of the whole class on which they are based, much less that they express the 'true' interests of the whole class. A trade union or trade association in a particular industry is a class organization, but not one that necessarily transcends the narrow bounds of its own industry. Indeed, this is the sense in which Marxists often speak of a 'corporativist' consciousness pertaining to the working class, and it may be thought that corporatist political structures serve in part to maintain such a limited, sectoral, subordinate class identity. It should be stressed, however, that the development of corporatist structures at the national level in liberal democracies has entailed the integration of the central organizations of capital and labour and encouraged their further</page><page sequence="20">178 Leo Panitch centralization so as to be able to overcome sectoral divisions within each class in the application of state economic policy. This has particularly been the case with incomes policy which seeks to overcome comparability wage bargaining between sectors in the labour market. Thus, while maintaining a 'corporativist consciousness' in the sense of subordination for the working class, national-level corporatist structures do not necessarily seek to maintain the primacy of sectoral representation or identity (although their instability is in good part related to their inability to effect this). It should be obvious, however, that corporatist structures need not necessarily be confined only to the central organizations of capital and labour or to incomes policy areas, even if their origins are clearly located there. It is entirely possible to conceive of corporatist structures developing in particular industrial sectors (conceived.broadly to include even such sectors as health or education) where the state, the owning or maxlaging authorities and the unions in these sectors interact in policy making. This is entirely consistent with a definition of corporatism in terms of the interaction of functional socioeconomic producer groups based directly on the division of labour. But the central point remains: not all groups are functional, not all group-state relations are corporatist, not all representation/social control takes place via groups at all. All this should be borne in mind before engaging in the troubling practice of classifying total societies as corporatist (a practice which Schmitter, for instance, prudently and properly rejects). But all this also suggests that particular spatial limits to even corporatist political structures should also be borne in mind, indeed 'openly acknowledged', rather than cast aside in a futile search for systemic alternatives to pluralism on its own expansive and non- .. . . . dlscrlmlnatory terraln. v It is one of the ironies of the recent literature on corporatism that even those who concentrate almost exclusively on the relations between the associations of capital and labour and the state, have also offered initial definitions of corporatism which are expansive in their scope. For instance, Gerhard Lehmbruch establishes the constituent units of corporatism merely as 'large interest organizations' which cooperate with each other and with public authorities. But he goes on to identify the organizations of capital and labour as the salient groups included in corporatist structures, with other groups (even organized agriculture) largely confined to the classical pluralist pattern. And he identifies the policy areas of corporatism as economic policy formation, with particular emphasis on incomes policy. This makes 'consensus-building in liberal corporatism largely contingent on the degree to which the labour movement is integrated into the process of policy-formation'. As</page><page sequence="21">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refections on agrowth industry 179 for trends indicating an eventual expansion of corporatist policy- makiIlg, he finds little evidence for their existence, and argues: 'Enlarging the field of corporatist economic decision-making beyond incomes policies (or, more exactly, control of wage policies) would have meant, among others, control of profit and of investments, and hence, a considerable structural transformation. This would have necessitated a shift in power relations which certainly could not be obtained within a corporatist system.'45 Bob Jessop, at least in his early formulations of the concept, also tended to define corporatism broadly as a 'state form', which stands in contrast with parliamentarism as a full political system. But far from identifying the conditions for the emergence of corporatism as a state form sui generis and successive to parliamentarism, his work stresses how corporatism is prone to contradictions and limitations which prevent this. Its expansion is limited by its inability 'to eliminate class conflict over the labour process . . . nor every form of competition among capitals.' Moreover, 'just because corporatism is appropriate to economic intervention (since it is constituted on the basis of function in the division of labour), it tends to be inadequate in other areas' - primarily in relation to 'popular democratic struggles' pertaining to regionalism, immigration, civil rights, etc. Here pluralist pressure politics and elected parliaments continue to play a 'central political function'. He sees corporatism, therefore, as part of a hybrid system of 'tripartism,' within which corporatist and parliamentary structures coexist and where the social democratic party plays a key role in integrating the corporatist and parliamentary elements.46 Yet a further example of the tendency to define the scope of corporatism broadly while substantively stressing its central location in the relations between the state and the associations of capital and labour, is seen in the recent work of Claus Offe.47 Offe begins with a prudent warning against incorporating the defects of pluralism into research on corporatism: 'Since the concept of"group" as used in pluralist political theory is utterly comprehensive and vague, little is to be gained by quantitative indications telling us how many groups become subject to institutionalization or formal status attribution.' Yet he too casts his corporatist net rather broadly, including not only 'organized collectivities representing the supply or demand sides of either labour markets or goods and services markets' (i.e. unions and employers organizations, investors and consumers), but also all those groups directly affected by state policies ('policy-takers'), amongst which he includes urban and regional governments, associations of tax- payers, welfare recipients, students, public hospitals and automobile associations. In order to take account, however, of that 'aspect of repressive discipline imposed by corporatist arrangements specifically upon the unions . . . (and) the fact that corporatist arrarlgements do specifically affect the terms, and institutional channels of class conflict',</page><page sequence="22">180 Leo Panitch he proposes 'a combined explanation that neither relies on the social class or the pluralist paradigm'. This involves seeing the corporatization of working-class organizations primarily in terms of the 'restraint' it is designed to impose, while for ordinary pluralist interest groups it primarily involves 'delegation' - that is, the contracting out of state power to reduce 'administrative overload'. Significantly, however, when he examines the structure and functioning of corporatism, Offe restricts himself to tripartite bodies of capital, labour and the state. Indeed, if his characterization of the functioning of corporatist structures is correct (as I believe it is), it is difficult to see how the other groups he mentions can be assimilated to it. For instance, the stress he places on the pattern of inter-group negotiations would not seem to characterize the relation of consumer groups, tax-payers or welfare-recipient organizations to public policy- making. Moreover, Offe's point that in the absence of majoritarian principles of legitimation corporatist structures tend towards 50 :50 representation between capital and labour to avoid continual procedural wrangling, would be contradicted by the inclusion of other groups. An interesting perspective on the apparent corporatization of other groups is in fact suggested by Offe in regard to various political platforms in West Germany which call for the corporatization of interest groups in general terms. As Offe points out 'the notion of uncontrolled interest group power was clearly aimed at the "irresponsible" inflation- causing behaviour of unions'. This suggests that a better way to approach any apparent trends towards the corporatization of interest groups in general (for which Offe, like others, offers very little empirical evidence, however) might be to distinguish between the 'dignified' facade of general attribution of 'political status' to groups by the state, and an 'efficient' system of corporatism involving the interaction of those groups based directly on the division of labour. In any case, the central thrust of Offe's contribution remains his argument that far more important than searching for general attributes of 'political status' among interest groups is the search for the differential attributes among the groups in corporatist structures, as determined by the effect their class location has on their organizational structure and their relations with the state. He argues, specifically, that the power of trade unions is based on the effectiveness of their collective organization. The power of capital on the other hand is based on control of the means of production. This control is not transferred to the interest associations of business by individual firms. This means that these associations' incorporation via state structure is less significant than is the incorporation of trade unions for labour, precisely because these associations play a less critical role for their class as agencies of struggle, of representation and of social control via corporatist structures than do trade unions for their class. It is scarcely possible to speak of the working class as an historical actor without speaking of the</page><page sequence="23">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refections on a growth industry 181 role of trade unions in class formation. This is much less the case with the interest associations of capital, not least because of the role the capitalist state itself plays in cementing a common interest among capital's competing fractions. Thus, Offe's work strongly supports our argument that corporatism is primarily about state-induced class collaboration: that far from being homogeneous in its composition and effects, corporatism is distinctly 'non-homogeneous' even with respect to the different class groups it incorporates. Research which primarily focuses on the formal aspects of corporatist structures will have little to tell us about corporatism's substantive character as a mechanism of state control over the organized working class in capitalist societies. VI The case that has been made here against ideal-typical expansive approaches to corporatism in advanced capitalist liberal democracies finds its echo in certain recent reactions against the application of similar approaches to Latin America. Linn Hammergren, in a recent attempt to confront the question raised by Schmitter of whether this 'is "still" or even "yet" the "century of corporatism" ', has argued that Latin American experience 'suggests that an emphasis on corporatist politics as a wider analytic framework may be anticipating a transition that has not yet occurred on even a very limited scale'.48 Similarly Alfred Stepan has stressed the invalidity of ideal-typical formal models of corporatism as total systems. He shows that historically no political system in Latin America has approximated exclusive reliance on corporatist interest intermediation mechanisms. 'The theoretical and political implication of this is that there are no fully corporate systems, but rather that there are political systems in some sectors of which (usually the working class) corporatist rather than pluralist patterns of interest representation predominate. The research implications of my argument are that "corporatism as structure" is always a partial sectoral phenomenon in the overall politcal system, and that supplementary analytic frameworks must be used to study other aspects of the system. '49 And Guillermo O'Donnell has specifically argued that corporatism's 'actual functioning and social impacts differ systematically according to changes largely determined by social class', that it is but 'one in the set of structures or modes of linkage with civil society', and that if the concept corporatism is 'stretched' beyond these limits, 'if it is postulated as an "alternative paradigm" to resolve the present crisis in conceptualization of Latin American politics and society, then I fear it will become another contribution to the Tower of Babel we are making of the social sciences'.50 It would certainly appear from the review ofthe literature undertaken in this paper, and no less in Latin America than in Western Europe and North America, that corporatism has all the earmarks of becoming an</page><page sequence="24">182 Leo Panitch 'essentially contested concept' in the social sciences. This occurs when 'disputes about descriptive features are so severe as to rule out any agreement over even the formal specification of the descriptive meaning' of a concept.51 And as with all such contested concepts, their contestibility extends beyond disputes over description to theoretical and evaluative disputes. Moreover, even if consensus were to be reached on a 'class-theoretical' approach to corporatism, fundamental differ- exlces would remain. For although a 'class-theoretical' approach is con- sistent with a historical materialist explanatoty framework, it need not necessarily be located therein, given the contested nature of class itself . . . ,8 as a socla , sclentlnc concept. This may be seetl by examining two recent 'class-theoretical' contributions to the 'growth industly'. We have already seen that in the context of the Latin American disputes, Alfred Stepan emphatically stresses the thrust of corporatism vis-a-vis working-class incorporatioIl; and with reference to advanced capitalist liberal democracy, Colin Crouch has explicitly rejected a definitiotl of corporatism in terms of 'the rise of organized groups, as opposed to individuals, as the main units of civil society to which the state relates' and adopted a definition which sees corporatism as 'the hierarchical non-conflictual integration of the state and organized groups representative of capital and labour', located specifically in a strategy of class domiIlation in the industrial relations system.52 Stepan puts emphasis on corporatism's role iIl 'reducing labour's capacity to strike'; Crouch stresses the involvement of unions 'in the process whereby labour is disciplined'. But why corporatism has this primary focus is either left unexplained (Stepan) or is associated with a general model of class domination in authority terms that owes more to Weber than to Marx (Crouch). A Marxist explanation of corporatism in terms of surplus value and class struggle over the intensification of exploitation might be partially consistent with these approaches, but it would have to point in different directions in terms of the historical causes, consequences and limits of corporatist structures and the possibilities and strategies for overcoming them. The difference between a Marxian and non-Marxian approach to corporatism, even if commonly cast in 'class-theoretical' terms, can be seen in the fact ultimately, and despite their perceptive analyses of 'actually existing corporatism' as unequal, dominating and coercive as far as the working class is concerned, both Crouch and Stepan end up seeing corporatism positively in evaluative terms, as a goal to be strived for. Stepan accepts corporatism as a normative model (organic statism, he calls it) which in terms of the norms of 'social equity, justice and participation' appears to be preferable to him to the Marxian vision of socialism and communism, which he conflates with a crude image of authoritarian party dictatorship. It is hardly surprising that the alternative he poses to the actual Latin American corporatist structures he analyses with such perceptiveness, is a 'true' corporatism, which goes</page><page sequence="25">Recent theorizations of corporatism: refiections on a growth industry 183 beyond 'consultation towards the power to make decisions and the capacity to work out priorities between sectors [which entailsl devolution of power from the strategic state elite to the new organs of participation. This is not a logical impossibility in the model.'53 Perhaps not, but as Stepan's own evidence suggests, it appears to be an historical one. Crouch, for his part, remains trapped in a general model ol alternative strategies of domination, so that all he can look forward to is the least ob jectionable form of domination. He sees trade unions as 'the most genuine element of pluralism in the political structure of modern capitalist societies, since they are almost alone in representing relatively unambiguously the interests of subordinates within the most funda- mental social relationship of the society'. He urges upon the unions, however, a system of'bargained corporatism' in which theyexchange 'the possibility of greater political influence and more and broader power for their members in the workplace . . . Lfor] a more obvious role lor the unions in restraining their members, more state interference and luller acceptance of the industrial order and its priorities'. His beliet that unions in this process could actually 'identify more closely with the concerns of their members' is only separable from original corporatist ideology by virtue of Crouctl's frank admission that even bargained corporatism 'must essentially be a strategy of reinforced domination'.54 To end as Crouch and Stepan do is almost to return full circle to corporatist ideology as it emerged, before its association with facsism, almost a centuiy ago. For despite their own critical treatment of actual historic corporatist structures in authoritarian and non-authoritarian regimes, they foster illusions, as before about some 'ideal' corporatism. How do they end up here? It involves, fundamentally, their taking a position, in evaluative terms, which rejects the possibility and/or desirability of socialism as a working class strategy to transcend capitalism and class domination and establish genuine democracy. And on this terrain, corporatism and socialism have always been contending, as well as contested, concepts. Although the debate is today cast in social scientific terms, it replicates the centuiy-old opposition between corporatism and socialism as two approaches to the state and society which commonly reject liberalism. The 'centuiy of corporatism' is still inconceivable except in terms of its old nemesis - the socialist alternative. As the growth industiy of corporatism in social science continues to expand, further effort will no doubt be directed toward developing a minimal descriptive definition on which there is concensus across the ideological/theoretical spectrum, if for no other reason than to avoid sheer relativism in the handling of the concept. Yet it is doubtful that much advantage will be gained from this. For although it may be possible to achieve concensus on a core descriptive definition, the definition will-have to be so formal as to be of little use in substantive</page><page sequence="26">184 Leo Panitch social and political analysis. The debate over definitions is really a debate between different theoretical frameworks, in which normative and ideological preferences play their part.55 Efforts to conceal these differences in a definitional concensus will only obscure rather than clarify the way corporatism is being used in social analysis. And given the immediate relevance of corporatism in contemporary society, this will not only have a social scientific effect, but a political and strategic one.

For instance, institutions like the IRC and NEB are seen by Winkler as being primary examples of corporatist institutions in Britain. But while these agencies' boards are dominated by businessmen rather than bureaucrats, they are not constituted on the basis of representation from functional interest groups per se. Indeed in both cases, the CBI was opposed to their establishment and consequently they were set up by the state in the face of the opposition of the functional association of business. In contrast, an institution such as the NEDC is constituted on the basis of explicit parity representation of the CBI and TUC and operates in terms of the interaction of these functional interest groups in decision making. To have individual businessmen occupying public and semi-public positions is not itself either new or necessarily corporatist, Although it no doubt serves to legitimate the activities of the state vis-a-vis the economy, it does not necessarily entail the integration of the interest associations of business in state structures. This perspective is also missed by Alan Cawson, for instance, who speaks of the IRC (established 4 years after the NEDC) as the first 'authentically corporatist institution in Britain'. This is the remit of his failure to distinguish clearly between individual firms and the interest associations of business, considering them both as functional groups. ('Pluralism Corporatism and the Role of the State', Government and Opposition, vol. 13, no. 2, Spring 1 9 7 8, esp. pp. 1 79, 1 8 7. ) The following section of this paper takes up the crlterlon ot lnteractlon among tunctlonal groups in policy making in allowing us to distinguish between corporatist political structures and those which are merely dominated by businessmen. 23.

Nedelman and Meier's.example that temperance groups have a major influence on economic questions (i.e. a decision to abolish taxes on a certain kind of beer), is not only spurious as an instance of economic policy-making, but indicates that this group's relations with the state were conducted via parliamentary rather than corporatiste decision-making structures. 40.

'One common denominator of corporations is that they are functional - that they define themselves by their role in society. This role is to produce goods or provide services indispensable to society. That is why . . . corporations are generally associated with the producers in society.' G. Ionescu, Centripetal Politics: Government and the New Centres o/ Power, London, Hart-Davis, McGibbon, 1974, p. 1 7. It should be noted, however, that this contemporary exponent of corporatist ideology himself immediately blurs the distinction between the state and auto- nomous 'corporations' in society by treat- ing territorial-administrative elements of the state below the central level as 'cor- porations'. 45.
