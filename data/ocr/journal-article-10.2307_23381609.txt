<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PLACE OF ISRAEL IN WORLD JEWISH STUDIES Alvin H. Rosenfeld In an important address, "On Jewish Learning," that he gave in Chicago in the fall of 1948, the scholar Simon Rawidowicz talked about the establishment of learning as a national ideal in Israel in the following terms: God has created man in his image, has created Israel in his image, too. A learning God - a learning nation. Until a short while ago God and Israel were united by this common link of learning. God learned, Israel learned. Now, I often think, God alone learns. For, never in the history of Israel's battle of learning have so few fought for so many who do not fight at all. Never have so few learned for so many who do not learn. But we do not want to be so few, to remain so few.1 The "Israel" that Rawidowicz refers to here is Am Yisrael, but given the date of his address - September 1948 - we are inevitably drawn to recall the events that had occurred only a few short months before, which created Medinat Yisrael. With the creation of the Jewish state, Jewish learning was to enter a new and dynamic phase, which would virtually guarantee that those who learned would never again remain "so few" Ö¾ and this not only within the borders of the state itself, but wherever significant communities of Jews were to be found. Indeed, I think it is not an exaggeration to say, in contradistinction to Rawidowicz's gloomy assessment, that there are probably more people engaged in Jewish study today than ever before. Moshe Davis, himself an early collaborator of Rawidowicz and one of his most accomplished successors, has referred to the rapid growth of Jewish studies worldwide as "an academic revolution."2 The phrase may sound like an overstatement, but even a cursory review of developments over the past few decades will show that, in fact, it is not. For example, in 1965 the number of American academic institutions that included Jewish Studies within the college curricula was estimated to be about 40; by 1980, that number had jumped to 400, and today it is significantly larger still. In 1980, the American Association of Jewish Studies listed some 600 scholars on its roster; today, the figure stands at almost 1,800. Fifteen years ago, there were 570 colleges and universities around the world with accredited courses in Jewish Studies; today, there are approximately 1,250 academic institutions where the study of Jewish civilization is pursued in one form or another. And 1. S. Rawidowicz, Studies in Jewish Thought, ed. N.N. Glatzer, Philadelphia 1974, p. 396. 2. M.

Significant work in some areas of Rabbinics and early Jewish mysticism is being carried on at the Free University in Berlin. Potsdam is creating a center for Jewish Studies with an emphasis on history; and Amsterdam already has such a center. Jewish Studies in America are developing ambitiously, so much so that courses on aspects of Jewish civilization are now offered on hundreds of college campuses across the United States. One indication of the size and seriousness of this growth is that American academic as well as mainline commercial presses annually publish more books on Judaism and the Jews than any individual can possibly read. Scholarly journals abound, as do high-level scholarly conferences. A consortium of American and Canadian scholars is teaching Jewish Studies at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow this summer, and other places in eastern Europe are likewise opening up to new forms of cooperative work in the field. In short, Moshe Davis was not exaggerating when he referred to an "academic revolution" underway in Jewish Studies on a global basis. The role of Israel in these developments has been and remains an extraordinarily important one. The Hebrew University alone boasts some seventy tenured professors within its multidisciplinary Institute of Jewish Studies, and has library and archival resources that are simply matchless. Bar-Ilan University lists 530 elective courses in basic Jewish Studies, a curricular concentration that no other institute anywhere can hope to duplicate. And significant teaching and research in the field take place day in and day out in Tel-Aviv, Haifa, and Ben-Gurion universities, as well as at other institutions of higher learning in Israel. When one adds to these impressive facts and figures the unique phenomenon that in Israel one pursues Jewish Studies in closest proximity to Jewish life in its most profound social reality, and within the context of a renascent and still developing Hebrew-language culture, Israel's singular position is self-evident. In reviewing these developments, one can take a good deal of satisfaction in what has been accomplished in the academic study of Judaism and the Jews. At the same time, we face a new set of possibilities and challenges today. I would like to share my reflections on several of these, especially as they relate to faculty resources and students. For many years, scholars from the United States, Europe, and elsewhere have regularly come to Israel to meet with colleagues, carry 22</page><page sequence="3">on research, teach at Israeli universities, and otherwise advance their professional knowledge and skills. That is all to the good. At the same time, Israeli academics cross the ocean in the other direction and engage in similar activities at American and European universities. That is also to the good. We work within very different academic cultures, and it is beneficial for all concerned to enjoy the scholarly contact that results from frequent meetings. Sometimes these encounters have resulted in American-bom scholars taking up permanent faculty positions at Israeli universities and Israeli scholars assuming professional positions abroad. Such developments can be individually desirable and institutionally advantageous. To the extent that they result in new forms of scholarly cross-fertilization, they can be broadly, and not just personally, enriching, for they lend a certain cosmopolitan or "extraterritorial" character to work in Jewish Studies. One hopes, however, that we will not reach a point at which this two-way cultural traffic will tilt too heavily in the westward direction. American colleges and universities, even in a period of relative stringency, now have over one hundred endowed faculty chairs in Jewish Studies, and this number is growing. Moreover, Jewish Studies in America are still young, and have not yet developed to the point where all of these attractive positions can be filled with senior scholars trained in American institutions. Given this fact, it is natural for America to look to Israeli scholars to fill this gap, and not just on the basis of visiting appointments. One hopes that Israel can find ways to cope with this situation institutionally, lest it face the loss of some of its best scholars. Turning now to the matter of our students, I once again take Moshe Davis as my guide. This is what he had to say some fifteen years ago in contemplating the condition of Jewish youth and the challenge this ppses to all of us engaged in higher education: There are vast numbers of our youth who feel they are Jews in the sociological sense even though their Judaism has no content. How can we attract them to a new awareness of the traditions and collective memory of our people? By availing ourselves of the highest denominator of our tradition, namely learning. In Judaism the exemplary Jew is not merely the learned Jew but the learning Jew. The Jewish ideal and the university ideal converge. The test, however, is to reach the academically trained on advanced levels of knowledge and content where the Jewish pattern is secondary. The challenge of our time is to relate Jewish consciousness to advanced national and universal currents of contemporary thought. We dare not run away from the encounter.3 3. Ibid, p. 6. 23</page><page sequence="4">At the time he wrote these words, Professor Davis had Diaspora youth in mind, but any candid assessment of the condition of young people in Israel today will acknowledge that large numbers of them might properly be included in Davis's analysis as well. The challenge that he defined for advanced Jewish Studies is largely a global one and deserves to be given very broad application. Whether this challenge is being met, however, or indeed whether it is even seriously recognized as a challenge by those of us involved in teaching Jewish Studies on the university level, is another matter. For important personal and professional reasons, most faculty members need to devote as much time as they can to research in their respective fields, so that the subject matter of what they teach, rather than the students to whom they teach, often assumes highest priority. To be sure, the two can never be strictly separated, and yet it is true that a scholar's attention is more likely to be focused on developing current research projects than on developing the students who sit before him in the classroom week in and week out. Most of these students are still in a formative stage of their personal development. The best of them are intellectually open and hungry for guidance and attention of a serious sort. Do their professors give it to them? Some do, more or less; others don't - and not because they do not care. It is never easy to resolve the tension between research and teaching commitments, which seems integral to the academic profession itself, but the effort must be constantly made; otherwise, we are likely to lose touch not only with one of our profession's essential reasons for existing, but, more seriously, with our young people themselves. For obvious reasons, that simply must not be permitted to happen. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Foundation that is being launched in Moshe Davis's honor will be devoted to the university teaching of Jewish civilization. One hopes that it will help to find new and effective ways to bring Jewish Studies to our students in forms that will reach them where they need and most want to be reached. Indeed, we can pay Davis no greater honor than to commit ourselves to raising the standards of teaching the subject to which he has devoted his entire professional life: namely, Jewish civilization in all of its ramifications, with Jerusalem as its abiding center. To do as much would be to assure the future of Jewish Studies on a still higher level of accomplishment and, thereby, contribute meaningfully to the Jewish future itself. Before concluding, I feel obliged to acknowledge some rhetorical sleight-of-hand that I have committed in the course of this paper and, in so doing, point to a challenge that is seldom examined by university based scholars. I began by referring to Simon Rawidowicz's "On Jewish Learning" and then went on to refer to the study of Jewish civilization 24</page><page sequence="5">in modern institutions of higher learning. There is a world of difference, however, between traditional Jewish learning - the lernen that was the true focus of Rawidowicz's reflections - and the kinds of study of Judaism and the Jews that we engage in at universities. The settings, presuppositions, disciplines, and motives of the one do not resemble those of the other in almost any respect, and yet at the heart of both are some common texts and, often, students and teachers sprung from a common stock and possessed by unusually strong intellectual and spiritual passions. Is there any way to forge a common language between those of us who have taken up Jewish Studies in the modern secular university and those whose commitment to learning Jewish texts brings them to the yeshiva world? 1 do not know; nor, seemingly, does anyone else. What I do know is that enormous energies are being devoted to both Jewish lernen and Jewish study, with very little, if any, contact between the vast numbers of people who are engaged in both. That situation seems to me in serious need of a healing "attention." I acknowledge that resolution of so radical a cultural bifurcation certainly cannot be achieved quickly and may not be possible at all. But it makes little sense for any people to persist in a condition in which its native brain power is so badly split, and to regard that condition as "normal." It is not. It may be no more than a Jewish fantasy of mine, but I entertain a notion that future scholars of Jewish civilization, perhaps under the guidance of the International Center for University Teaching of Jewish Civilization, may find a way to address this rift in Jewish consciousness in ways that will enable Jewish life to flourish in more harmonious and still more creative ways. This may not be an easily achievable ideal, but why not hold it as an ideal all the same? I began with a quotation from Simon Rawidowicz and want to close with one as well: "As long as Israel will be Israel, it will be, it must be, a learning nation. As long as it will have a God, He will be a learning God." No one of us doubts that the people of Israel will continue to study and to lern, in the land of Israel as well as abroad. As for the God of Israel, I myself am not in the least disturbed by the anthropomorphism that Rawidowicz invokes. Indeed, I find it a noble, inspiring way to think of the work we do, and I am moved to believe that our labors will earn His fullest blessing if we pursue them with the kind of dedication and purpose that Moshe Davis has exemplified throughout his entire professional career. 25</page></plain_text>
