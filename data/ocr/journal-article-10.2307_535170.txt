<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BI,ACK Ox: A STUDY IN THE HISTORY OF A FOLK-TALE, by Archer Taylor. FF Communications No. 70, Helsinki, 1927. The most recent of the penetrating studies in folk-lore by Professor Taylor presents to the American student for the first time the results of the careful technique in the investigation of folk-tales which has been worked out by European scholars under the leadership of the Finns. But the work before us is more than a mere application of this method to one more tale; it is more than an exemplification in English of something that has been long known in Finland. The study represents a real forward step in development of the technique of folk-tale research. The tale chosen for investigation is an extraordinarily simple one, with a very small number of motifs. Moreover, it is confined to purely traditional or popular material. Its distribution is within very narrow limits, hardly extending outside of Finland. But within Finland there are over a hundred versions for comparison. The conditions for a thoroughgoing analytical study are, therefore, unusually favorable. But if the extent is small, both of the tale itself and of the , ria of distribution, th- study is correspondingly heightened in intensivcness. It shows clearly what a stupendous undertaking a thorough study of one of the world-wide tales might be, and it serves as an effective warning against facile conclusions about tales and their origins and distribution. The study begins with a remarkably lucid presentation of the method employed .-- perhaps the best statement yet made of the "Finnish Method".' The author shows that after the first stage in the study, the bringing together of as large a number of versions as possible, an important task is the analysis of the tales into their component traits or motifs. It is by a well-regulated and thorough study of these traits that the goal of the study is to be reached: a determination of the normal form of the tale, of its general area of origin, of its lines of dissemination, of its changes en route, and (perhaps) of some idea as to its age. The relation of particular versions of a tale to that abstraction known as the "normal form" must be understood before it is possible with any intelligence to seek to derive the latter from the many variants. On this point, the author says:2 "In undertaking the reconstruction we shall examine in turn each incident or trait and seek to establish by comparison its primitive form. After esta- blishing each element in this manner, we may by simple addition of the elements arrive at the outlines of the primitive form of the whole. Each trait will of necessity be either preserved or altered in the process of oral trans- mission. In the event of its preservation there will of course be no difficulty IFor other statements see Aarne (A.), Leitfaden der Vergleichenden Mdrchenforschung (PP Communications No. 13), and Krohn (K.), Die Folk- loristische Arbeitsmethode, Oslo, 1926. 2P. 4.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. 1 23 in the selection of the primitive form, for there is but one to choose. When, however, the episode has been modified in tradition, all its variations -in- cluding, of course, its absence, which may represent the original situation - must be collected and examined. These variations will fall into larger and smaller groups and often some will stand quite alone without parallels. Out of these variations it is necessary to select one which exists among them, or to deduce one which is implied by them, as the primitive form. Such a form will not only justify itself as the original, but will also be the basis for explaining the later and varying forms as plausible alterations of the ori- ginal. Its establishment is the first goal of our efforts, and by its establish- ment we shall learn much about the origin and dissemination of the tale." He shows that it is often not possible to fix upon a normal form directly, but that various local normal forms must be worked out first.' How is a trait to be recognized as belonging to the normal or primitive form ? The criteria are well summed up in a sentence where Professor Taylor is anticipating objections :2 "Let it be granted at once that a numerical preponderance of aparticular trait among the variations does not establish its position in an earlier hypo- thetical form. Similarly no single criterion affords a compelling reason for the determination of a trait as primitive. The most determinedly hostile critic must, however, concede that a trait which is widely distributed, which appears frequently in the variants, particularly in the fuller and better ones, which is attested at an early period in the tale's recorded history, which is per se old (involving some ancient religious or superstitious idea), which is useful in the tale's economy, which permits competing forms to be derived from it by some natural and readly explicable alteration or substitution, which yields evidence in agreement with that deducible from other traits, and which shows a development in accord with a known or a probable cul- tural trend, must belong to the earliest ascertainable form of the tale.,o Granted that the trait meets these requirements, one is compelled to accept it as original." That all of the criteria are seldom available the author admits, but he feels from his experience in the study of tales that the number of traits about which a safe conclusion cannot be reached is very small. The way in which the various traits in a tale must be scrutinized in order to determine their relation to the original form is next considered. ",Since we know what changes can occur in the transmission of tales and how these changes can be used to fix the direction of a tale's development (although as a general principle the change may be from B to A as well as from Ato B), we can identify one form as original and another as secondary. "3 The author then quotes freely from Professor Krohn: 1 He thus meets the objections raised by Dr. C. W. von Sydow and his disciples. See Liljeblad (S.), Die Tobiasgeschichte und andere Mdrchen von toten Helfern, Lund, 1927. In this work insistence is made on the fact that a tale may be resolved in to a number of "oikotypes", one for each geographi- cal section, and that such should be the goal of folk-tale research. 2 P. 7.

Among these far from numerous laws may be mentioned: the forgetting of a detail, the acclimati- zation of a strange and the modernizing of an obsolete object (trait), the generalizing of a special term and the specializing of a general one, the rearranging of the order of events, the confusing of persons or acts, the multiplying, particularly by the numbers 3, 5, and 7 (of persons and things), polyzoism, in which many animals replace a single one, anthropomorphism of animals and its opposite, egomorphism, in which the narrator himself appears as hero, and so on." A point insisted on by Professor Taylor, and not sufficiently by earlier workers in the field, is the value of negative evidence. Hence, in his tabulation of traits he is very careful to make note of absences of traits. Non-existence of a trait, he remarks, is a variation always to be taken into account. It is impossible in a short space to give such a detailed discussion of the method as will represent the clear-cut statement of the introduction to The Black Ox. It must not be thought, however, that the author imagines that he will arrive at the actual original of the tale by the method employed; he will be able only to show that the original form possessed this and that trait. This "original form" or "normal form" is very valuable as a point of de- parture in discussing the vicissitudes of the tale. It serves much the same purpose as the "starred" Indo-European forms in the study of language. Only an examination of the main study with its carefully-wrought con- clusions can give an idea of the thorough manner in which the theories dis- cussed in the introduction are put into practice. Folklorists in America owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Taylor for presenting to us so clearly this method of folk-tale study, which is being more and more widely adopted by European scholars. The method may well be employed outside the special field of Europe and Asia, to which it has thus far been confined. It may also be used as a basis for the restudy of the popular ballads. The great collectors and annotators of the past have brought together a large amount of material, and they have made many comparisons, often implying principles involved in the present method. But, as Professor Taylor has pointed out in a recent article', it remained for the Finnish scholars to formulate these well attested principles into a definite scholarly discipline. The study of the tale and the ballad need no longer be the random matter it has too frequently been in the past. With this method applied to a large number of tales, we may at last reach a place where we can again, this time on a reasonably safe basis, theorize as to the history of folk-tales and ballads. And meantime these very studies will undoubtedly bring much to light about lines of transmission, influences, even migrations of peoples, that are now hidden from the eyes of the historian. It is fortunate that this study in English will again call to the attention of the English-speaking reader the notable series of folk-lore studies of which it is a part. Since their inception, a score of years ago, the FF Communications have appeared in more than seventy monographs on folk-lore written in French, German, or English. Perhaps the majority of them have had to do with the tale. Of those, three main kinds of study have appeared. First, 1 Modern Philology, XXV (I928), 48I.</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews. 1 25 a classification of tales (recently revised) served as a basis for surveys of tales in various countries. Then, some ten or twelve such surveys have appeared, making it possible to save days in searching collections. Finally a number of studies of particular tales, some of them models of scholarship, have appeared in the series. It is unfortunate that so many important American libraries have failed to subscribe for this fundamental aid in folk- lore study. As contributor of one of the brilliant studies of folktales in this series, Professor Taylor is to be congratulated on the lucidity and thoroughness of his monograph, which marks a real advance ini the progrees of folk-tale research.
