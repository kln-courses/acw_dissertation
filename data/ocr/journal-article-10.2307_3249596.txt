<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY H. FONG University of California, Davis THE ICONOGRAPHY OF THE POPULAR GODS OF HAPPINESS, EMOLUMENT, AND LONGEVITY (FU LU SHOU) T o satisfy demands for auspicious images of economic fortune and personal well-being in the late Ming, Chinese artists created the triad of Fu Lu Shou, the Gods of Happiness, Emolument, and Longevity, which rapidly grew in popularity, gracing the halls of the imperial palace as well as the homes of peasants., Commonly titled San Xing (Three Stars),2 the triad joined the ranks of such illustrious trios as San Sheng (Three Sages), San Bao (Three Precious Ones), and San Qing (Three Pure Ones).3 Even though a late-comer in Chinese popular art, the "San Xing tu," or representation of the Three Stars, is the best known of the triads. This theme had such widespread appeal that it was portrayed in a variety of media: traditional paintings, woodcut prints, stone reliefs, porcelain decorations, and "Nian hua" (New Year pictures).4 It was this last folk art medium, the color woodcut print produced inexpensively for mass consumption, that promoted the dissemination of the Three Stars throughout China. Despite its obvious popularity, the history of Fu Lu Shou and the evolution of its iconography has never been studied. This paper will focus on the origin of the Fu Lu Shou triad, the factors that nurtured its development through the centuries, and the artistic influences that entered into its iconographic formulation as evidenced by the Nian hua art form. Given the increased interest in Chinese folk SThis paper developed from a study given at a conference on "Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy in Late Imperial China: Cultural Beliefs and Social Divisions" held in Montecito, California, August zo20-2z6, 1981. 2 The term "san xing" in the Shijing (Book of Songs) has been translated the three stars of the Belt of Orion; see A. Waley, The Book of Songs (New York: Grove Press, g196o), p. 87. However, the Jian annotation for the Shijing states that San Xing is another term for the Can or Xin constellation; see Maoshi .hengiian in Sibu beiyao (Taipei: Chung-hua shu-chii 1965-66), 6.3b-4a. Later, when the gods of Fu Lu Shou appeared in popular art, the term was applied to the newly created triad. 3 The Three Sages are Confucius, gkyamuni, and Lao Zi; see, H.Dore, Researches into Chinese Superstititons, VI. Trans. M.Kennelly (Taipei: Chengwen Publishing Company, 1966), pp. 1-3. The Precious Ones may refer to the Three Great Buddhas or the Three Jewels; see, Dore, VI (1966), pp. 15-21. The Three Pure Ones usually signify the Taoist triad that was invented to counteract the Buddhist triad but is known "differently from different sources"; see H. Welch, Taoism: The Parting of the Way. Rev. ed. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1966), p. 137. Summing up the various opinions, the Chung-wen ta tZ'u-tien (Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language) (Taipei: Chung-kuo wen-hua yen-chiu so, I962-68), I.26 (o10. I175) lists Yu Qing as "Yuan Shi Tian Zun" (The Celestial Honored One of the Original Beginning), Shang Qing as "Ling Bao Dao Jun" (The Sacred Jewel of the Honored One), and Tai Qing as "Tai Shang Lao Jun" (The Most Supreme Being of the Honored One, or Lao Zi). See also, Dore, VI (1966), pp. I1-12. 4 This category of colorful woodcut prints, known as "zhi hua" (paper picture) in the Song dynasty, became increasingly popular during the Ming-Qing period among the people, who used them to adorn their homes for the celebration of the Chinese New Year. 159</page><page sequence="2">art, which has sparked a number of articles on the New Year pictures a study of the popular gods of Fu Lu Shou is overdue. What makes Fu Lu Shou unique among the Chinese popular gods is the process of its evolution. Rather than simply becoming anthropomorphized from myths, legends, or religious worship, it emerged in Ming popularized art and literature from the etymological significance of the very words fu, lu, and shou. Of the three gods, Shou Xing, the Star of Longevity, has the longest and most colorful history. The earliest known occurrence of the term as applied to a deity is in the Shiji (Historical Records) by Sima Qian (c. 145 - c.90 B.C.). In the chapter "Feng Shan shu," a treatise on Feng and Shan observances, he mentioned a Shou Xing Ci (Star of Longevity Sanctuary) at Du Bo which was believed to have been established by the First Emperor of Qin (r. 221-2io B.C.).6 The origin of the term "Shou Xing," as expounded in the lexicon Erya (Literary Expositor), is an emanation of two star-groups, the Jiao and Kang, the first two heading the list of Ershiba xiu, the Twenty-eight Constellation.7 Shou Xing's counterpart in Occidental astronomy is Canopus, the largest of the stars in the constellation Carina but the second brightest in the heavens after the nearby northern Sirius, the Dog or Chinese Wolf Star.8 Apparently, the equation of the Star of Longevity with Nan Ji Lao Ren, the Old Man of the South Pole, occurred also in early Han. It was Sima Qian again who pointed out the inter- changeable relationship in his chapter "Tian Guan shu," a treatise on astronomy: The huge (bright) star located lower than the Wolf Star in the southeast is called the Old Man of the South Pole. When it appears, the nation enjoys peace; when it does not appear, military men rise up. It is seen regularly around the time of the autumnal equinox in the south.9 Of primary significance here is that Sima Qian did not simply state that Shou Xing was one of the stars of portent astrology, which was highly important in Han times, but also indicated that it had an anthropomorphic identity which paved the way for its popularity in Chinese art. The strongest identification of Shou Xing as the Old Man of the South Pole, however, was made shortly after the Eastern Han dynasty (25-22I). A reiteration is contained in the fin shu (History of the fin): The Old Man Star located south of the Hu Constellation (in the southeastern horizon), also known as Nan Ji, appears regularly in late autumn and disappears in early spring. When it is seen, peace prevails (in the nation) and the sovereign is blessed with a long life. o s Wang Shu-cun, "Lu Xun yu nianhua di shouji he yanjiu," Meishuyanjiu ,I982, no.

I35. 16o</page><page sequence="3">But the heyday of the Old Man Star was reserved for the Tang dynasty (6 I 8-906). As if its astrological prognostication had actually contributed to the three-century long Golden Age, it was singled out as the most important rui xing (auspicious star) of the dynasty. Several out- standing scholars are known to have written specific memorials to the throne on the occasions of its auspicious appearance., Famous poets such as Li Bai (701I-762) and Du Fu (712-770) incorporated into their poems the appellation of Nan Ji Lao Ren as an analogy of Heaven's blessings.1, In 736, the famous Emperor Ming Huang (r. 713-7 56) even sanctioned the worship of the astral god as an official cult by an edict specifying the erection of a Shou Xing Tan (Star of Longevity Altar).13 Following its imperial recognition, the significance attached to the stellar apparition became an important national event during the Northern Song dynasty (960-- 127). The Wenxian tongkao (an encyclopedia on governmental affairs from the beginning of history to the early thirteenth century) lists literally countless instances of sightings of the Old Man Star that had occurred in each and every reign of the Song emperors; 4 perhaps the precarious diplomacy with the northern invaders, the Khitan Liao and the Xi Xia, had prompted a greater frequency in the watch for auspicious assurances from the Old Man Star. Noted also in the compendium is that a special commemorative observance was held at each apparition from the time of Emperor Tai Zhong (r.976-998) until its abolishment in Io90 by an imperial decree. However, the idea of longevity associated with the Old Man of the South Pole superceded all other connotations of propitiousness. Seen earlier in the quotation from the History of the fin, the benefits of the Old Man Star were extended also to an individual; besides granting peace to a nation, the blessing of long life was given to its sovereign. It was during this period that a mythological tale relating longevity with the Old Man of the South Pole appeared in Chinese literature. Recounted by Gan Bao (fl. 317-322) in his Soushenji (Researches into the Supernatural), the story takes the following picturesque form: Guan Lu (a celebrated physiognomist), while in Ping Yuan, prognosticated that (Zhao) Yan's countenance showed indications that he would die young. His father begged Lu to change his prediction. Lu, therefore, advised him to send his son with a bottle of wine and some dried deer meat to the southern district of Yi Mai where he would find two men playing chess under a huge mulberry tree. He was to serve them wine and meat, and refill their cups when empty so that they could have their fill. And, if he were being questioned, he should reply by bowing politely and remain silent. Lu promised that in doing so, someone would help him. Yan faithfully followed the directions and found indeed two chess players to whom he assiduously served wine and meat. The two men, being deeply engrossed in their game, accepted the repast without looking up. All of a sudden, the one sitting on the north side noticed the lad and angrily demanded to know who he was. At which the one sitting on the south side said, "We have consumed his wine and food; we cannot be rude to him." "But," said the former, "it is already written in the Book." The latter replied, "Let me see the Book." Having found that Yan was destined to die at nineteen, he took up a brush, transposed the two characters and said to him, "You have been rescued to live until the age of xI Schafer, pp.68-69. 12 Respectively see, Quan Tang shi (Taipei: Fu-hsing shu-chii, I967): Li Bo I7.-3 b-4a (99I) and Du Fu 16.9a (1372). 13 Tang hbuiyao (Taipei: Shih-chieh shu-chti, 1963), 22.427.

Guan Lu then explained to him, "You have been helped enormously; you should be happy now for having received so many additional years to your life. The one who sat on north side is Bei Dou and the one on the south is Nan Dou. Nan Dou records the date of birth, Bei Dou the date of death."I's This account, though ascribing the task of dispensing longevity to a different star, Nan Dou (Southern Dipper), a counterpart of Bei Dou (Northern Dipper), has been incorporated into the legend of Shou Xing by both Dore (1859-1934)16 and Werner (1864-1954)17 in their works on Chinese popular cults. While Werner cautiously translated Nan Dou as the Spirit of the South Pole, Maspero (1883-1945) simply referred to it as the God of the South Pole with a footnote saying that the North and South Poles should be viewed in a topographical rather than an astronomical sense.18 His statement is supported by Day (1889- ) who points out in his study on Chinese peasant cults that Nan Dou is one of the popular gods worshipped also for the blessing of longevity.19 More importantly, Gan Bao's legend provides a glimpse of the Old Man Star who dispenses longevity as an anthropomorphic being, and suggests the possibility of his image being painted at this time. Indeed, painters who had rendered star-gods, as recorded in the Northern Song imperial catalogue of painting, Xuanhe huapu (preface, i2zo), consisted of some of the most out- standing artists of the Six Dynasties through Northern Song,zo but only two painters, Zhang Suqing of Tang and Huang Quan of the Five Dynasties, had produced a "Shou Xing xiang," an icon of the Old Man Star.2" A slightly earlier text on painting, the tenth century Yizhou minghua lu, mentions a third painter, Shi Ke of Northern Song, who had also done a picture of the Star of Longevity.zz On the basis of such textual evidence, it is reasonable to assume that the depiction of the God of Longevity was first produced during the Tang-Song period and preceded the formu- lation of the Fu Lu Shou triad. As far as is known, the oldest extant example of Shou Xing is a 1572 color woodcut representation (Fig. I).a As a print after an original by the Ming painter, Jiang Song, alias Sansong (dates unknown),.4 it may have retained as much of the Tang-Song as Soushenfji (Hubei: Zhongwen shuju, I875), 3-3 a-b.

Collection of the author</page><page sequence="23">conception of the Old Man Star as that carried over into the iconography of Fu Lu Shou, for artistic tradition in Chinese art is as persistent as poetic imageries in Chinese literature. Here, Shou Xing, identified by inscription as well as by the stylized shou character in the center of the roundel pattern on the robe, is shown as a venerable old man of short stature, who has a white beard and moustache, and whose head is not only bald but has a rather high forehead with three wrinkles immediately above the eyebrows. All of these facial features as well as his daoyi, the ankle-length Taoist robe (characterized by diagonal lapels, voluminously wide sleeves, wide- band borders, and a cord girdle),2s hitherto unidentified as such, are marks of his identity. So is the handscroll tucked in his breast, which appears to be an incidental detail but, as will be seen, recurs in every formal representation of the deity; it probably signifies the Book of Life de- scribed in Gan Bao's legend. The red color of the Taoist robe, on the other hand, indicates that the work was most likely produced for the imperial house; a chapter on Yu fu (regulations for carriage types and court costumes) in the Ming shi (History of Ming) states that the red dao yi was required of a Taoist when attending court..6 Certainly, the depiction of Shou Xing in the respectful posture of salutation, standing with both hands hidden under the sleeves and bowing slightly, is most appropriate for adorning the hall of an imperial palace. Before considering the question of when the representation of Fu Lu Shou first appeared, the meaning of the characters fu, lu, and shou must be analyzed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the origin of the triad. Fu, when translated as "blessing," expresses perfectly its inherent idea of zuo andyou, divine gifts or assistance;.7 and lu, as "emolument," corresponds precisely to Zheng Xuan's (127-200) annotation for the Shijing (Book of Songs) which says, "Winning an official position is fu and accepting the awarded remuneration is lu."-28 The charactersfu and lu originally signified the same thing; they were used together as a generic term to mean any kind of "bestowed" gifts or favors. For example, in the Book of Songs, "fu lu" referred to the blessings of the ruling class: "Wherever the Lord goes to visit, there fu lu will follow in abundance," or "Long live our Lord! Mayfu lu be his forever!"29 This imagery, like others from the Book of Songs, was continued all through the Six Dynasties, Tang, and Northern Song, but with a new emphasis; it became applicable to anyone deemed worthy of receiving it.30ao Subsequently, it was something desired by every Chinese family. Shou, though in a strict etymological sense it signifies "longevity," had been designated since the Late Zhou (722-221 B.C.) as one of wufu, the five blessings (shou or longevity, fu or wealth, kang ning or health, xiuhao de or moral integrity, and kaozhong ming or natural death),a which 2s See illustration and description in Sancai tuhui.

Another woodcut print from the ink-cake album Chengshi moyuan (i 6o6), published by Cheng Dayue (I54I-c.I616), also an ink producer of Shexian, shows a similar depiction (Fig.3).35 The God of Longevity is now accompanied by an additional creature, a crane, which is standing by him on his left, as a counterpart of the deer on his right. The crane, like the deer, is likewise a Taoist symbol of longevity; the xuan he (black crane) is said to have lived at least two thousand years.36 The paramount role of Shou Xing in the representation cannot possibly be mistaken, as it is reiterated in the images of the deer and the crane. In the etymological sense, apropos the illustration for Fang Yulu's album, this work signifies shou as well asfu and lu. It is interesting to note, too, that this particular woodcut print, which was published some twenty years later than Fang Yulu's, has incorporated features from both traditional and popular expressions of visual art. The depiction of Shou Xing seated under a pine tree recalls immedi- ately the iconography of the Six Dynasties Taoist recluse such as seen in the recently discovered 2 Chung-hua min-su pan-hua (The Graphic Art of Chinese Folklore) (Taipei: National Museum of History, 1977), pl. on p. 69. In popular connotation, the idea of shou is equated with that offu, as expressed in "Shou bi Nanshan; Fu ru Donghai" meaning "Longevity (lasts) like the Southern Mountain; happiness, like the Eastern Sea."

If it were a product of 15 Io (geng wu), as claimed, it would be a prototype of the woodcuts in the Fangshi mopu and Chengshi moyuan, but the artist, Li Fengchun, is unidentifiable and the authenticity of his inscription is dubious, as it is written in the standard rather than the seal script style specified by the title of the representation. Also, the execution of the star-god is crude and wrongly proportioned. 36 Taipingyulan, p.415o; and TianZhongji, p. 1905.

The artist who designed the representation for Cheng Dayue's album has made use of pictorial idioms, both traditional and popular, to satisfy the taste of the literate class for a new theme. There is no question that both ink-cake illustrations portray Shou Xing or Nan Ji Lao Ren, as the inscriptions on their reverse sides begin with the characters "Nan Ji," the standard abbreviation for the God of Longevity (Figs. 2 and 3). The inscription on Fang Yulu's is almost an exact quote of the passage from the History of the fin, "When the Old Man of the South Pole is seen, the sovereign enjoys a long life and peace reigns in the nation." The only difference is the precedence of the idea of longevity over that of peace. What is most striking in the two woodcut illustrations are the identifiable features of the deity, the short stature, the bald head, the high forehead with three wrinkles, the beard and moustache, the dao yi, and the handscroll, all of which are seen in the earlier color woodcut representation. Beyond doubt all three works share a common source of inspiration. A prototype that fits the depiction of the Old Man Star is seen in the painting titled "The Three Doctrines" (Fig.4), attributed to Josetsu, one of the most gifted Japanese ink painters of the fifteenth century.4o The similarities between the images of Confucius and Shou Xing, especially the one from Fang Yulu's album, are astonishing. Not only do they resemble each other in overall attitude and appearance, but they have the same squinting eyes, sharply pro- truding cheeks, heavy eyebrows, and wispy beards. In accordance with the Chinese belief that Confucius was born with a cranium shaped like Ni Qiu (Ni Hill),4 he is given a prominent looking head with a high forehead and, in imitation, Shou Xing is portrayed with a distinctly elongated bald head. Obviously, then, the late Ming image of Shou Xing was derived from a prototype of a venerable figure such as Josetsu's Confucius. 37 A.C.Soper, "A New Chinese Tomb Discovery: The Representation of a Famous Literary Theme," Artibus Asiae, XXIV, 1961, pp. 79-86 and fig.

An earlier iconography, preserved as a decoration on a ceramic pillow (dated I179), depicts the Three Sages seated around a chess game; see, Riddell, pl. 31. Apparently, this version, which is entirely different from that shown in Josetsu's representation, was a prototype of the "Three Sages" by Sesshu now kept in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; see Matsushita Takaaki, Ink Painting. Trans. and adapted by M.Collcutt (New York: Weatherhill, 1974), fig. 71. 4x Shiji, 47.1 b-2a states that Confucius was named Qiu (hill) and given an alias Zhongni because prior to his birth his mother had offered prayers at Niqiu (Ni Hill) and when the Sage was born, he was found to have a head shaped like a qiu. However, traditional images ofConfucius, including the earliest extant version believed to have been based on a painting by the famous Tang painter, Wu Daozi, show him to have a head that is anything but unusual; see Baba Harukichi, Koshi seiseki shi (Tokyo: Dait6 bunka kyakai, 1934), figs. on pp. 162-66. Thus, Josetsu's work, which was based on a Southern Song model, is the earliest known version of Confucius depicted with an extraordinarily high forehead. The use of this distinguishing feature for a venerable personage may have been inspired by portrayals of Buddhist monks, several examples of which surviving to our times are dated to Southern Song; see, H. B.Chapin, "A Long Roll of Buddhist Images, III," revised by A.C.Soper, Artibus Asiae, XXXII, 1970, pl. 15, no.32; and W.Fong, The Lohans and A Bridge to Heaven (Freer Gallery of Art Occasional Papers, III, no. i) (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 195 8), pl. 1. 183</page><page sequence="26">Josetsu's work, like other ink paintings of his time in Japan, was based on an earlier Southern Song (x127-1279) model of the Chan school of painting. Such a prototype must have been available to Ding Yunpeng (c. I 547-c. -62I) who designed the woodcut illustrations for Fang Yulu and Cheng Dayue.42 As a late Ming painter who was interested in the tradition of past figure masters and who executed many paintings of Buddhist themes, Chan Buddhist and otherwise,4s he may even have had access to the very same type of model that inspired Josetsu. This conclusion may also be applied to Jiang Song who painted the original of the 1572 wood- cut (Fig. i), for the resemblance between his Shou Xing and Josetsu's Confucius is likewise remarkably close. The practice of adapting an established iconography and perpetuating the traditional past by later Chinese painters supports my earlier suggestion that the Tang-Song conception of the Old Man Star could not be very different from the representation shown in the oldest extant work. Another color woodcut depiction, showing Shou Xing with the Eight Immortals (Fig. 5), dated 1597, some years later than the black and white one in Cheng Dayue's album, seems to indicate the late Ming version of the Old Man Star in its fully developed configuration. Shou Xing here is characterized by not only all of the identifiable features enumerated so far but also several of the most enduring hallmarks, the overly tall cranium, a youthful countenance, and a long staff--held by one of his attendants.44 As to the inclusion of the Eight Immortals, the group of Taoist deities which came into prominence in the Yuan dynasty (1279-1368),4 the immense popularity of longevity is further emphasized. That Shou Xing is shown seated under a tree, a landscape setting essentially the same as that found in the later of the two woodcuts by Ding Yunpeng, demonstrates that the work was produced for a sophisticated audience. This point is underlined by the elaborate frame, the design of which consisting of a number of the newly invented one-hundred-script version of the shou character,46 is fundamentally literary in feeling and attraction. Unfortunately this elegantly mounted print is unsigned but its original must have been rendered by a competent painter. In theme and execution, the 1597 woodcut apparently was a direct outcome of a super- natural drama that was initially fashionable in the Ming court. The Eight Immortals, China's 42 Having examined and compared the landscape details, the deer image, and the drapery folds in these two works with those prints that are identified by seal imprints as having been executed by Ding Yunpeng, I have no doubt that they were executed by him; see, Chengshi moyuan, III (Yutu).8 b, II b, Izb, and 38 a (for landscape details); and Fangshi mopu, III (Bogu).I6a (landscape details), IV (Bowu).3oa (deer image), and II (Guohua).2b (drapery folds). 43 For a discussion of his linear style, one which lends itself most suitably to adaptation of his paintings for woodcut reproductions; see, Li Chu-tsing, A Thousand Peaks and Myriad Ravines (Switzerland: Artibus Asiae, 1974), PP. 22-25. *4 A Ying (Qian Xingcun), Zhongguo nianhuafaZhan shiliie (Beijing: Chaohua meishu chuban she, 1954), pp. 5-6, and pl. on p.22; and Higuchi Hiroshi, comp., Chbgoku hanga shbisei (Tokyo: Mito sho-oku, 1967), pl.23-36. A Ming porcelain dish made during the Wanli period (1573-1620) depicts the same theme; see, A.Christie, Chinese Mythology (London: Hamlyn, 1968), pl. on p. I io. In the latter, the long staff is likewise held by his attendant. Shou Xing's typical aspects, as pointed out by a Ming scholar of the Zheng Tong period (1436-1450), consist of an elongated head, short height, and a long staff; see, Cao An, Lanyan Zhangyu in Baoyan tong biji (Shanghai: Wenming shuju, 1922), Hui IV.4b. 45 The Eight Immortals in this late Ming representation are still depicted in the Yuan version as an all-male group. The replacement of the male Xu Xianweng with the female He Xiangu took place in the sixteenth century following the publication of the novel, Dongyuji by Wu Yuantai (fl.c. I 522-73); see, Sun Hsien-chao, Kuo-chii ku-shih so-yiian (Taipei: Cheng-chung shu-chii, 1976), P. ioo.

The "Qunxian qingshou Pan Tao Hui" (A Group of Immortals Celebrate Longevity at the Pan Tao Festival), one of the extant dramas written by Zhu Youdun (1379-1439),47 a grandson of the Ming founder, features Shou Xing and the Eight Immortals as prominent guests at Xi Wang Mu's longevity festival.48 Developed from the legend of Xi Wang Mu (Queen Mother of the West) and her pan tao (longevity peaches grown on a tree in her garden that takes 3,000 years to blossom),49 the drama was written specifically for a birthday festival and possibly for that of an emperor; the celebration of longevity, as noted in the Ming Taizu shilu (Annals of Ming Taizu), had been reestablished as a custom ever since it was first held for the Ming founder's birthday in 1380.so In a similar drama, the "Yao Chi Ba Xian qingshou" (The Eight Immortals Celebrate Longevity at Jasper Lake), also by Zhu Youdun, there are lyrics addressed directly to the Ming emperor to wish him the blessings of long life.si At least three others of his plays are focused on the theme of a longevity celebration.52" Since he is recognized as a playwright who contributed substantially to transforming drama into an attractive form of entertainment,sa it is conceivable that they were not only performed outside the imperial palace but that well-known painters of the time became involved in the rendering of some of the favorite scenes for their patrons. Most significantly, one of Zhu Youdun's longevity dramas is titled "Fu Lu Shou Xianguan qinghui" (The Festival of the Immortal Officials Fu Lu Shou) which figures the Three Stars descending to this world to celebrate the New Year Festival.s4 To my knowledge, this is the earliest mention of Fu Lu Shou as a triad of popular gods in a Chinese literary text. As a matter of fact, the trio emerged quite unobtrusively in a natural process, as a result of the use of traditionally known terminology in his lyrics. This can be observed in the scripts of the two dramas that are similar in theme, the "Qunxian qingshou Pan Tao Hui" and the "Yaochi Ba Xian qingshou." In the former, which is evidently the earlier of the two because the title "Pan Tao Hui" is that of a Yuan play,ss Shou Xing appears alone and is hailed as an immortal who bringsfu and lu. When writing the script for this drama, Zhu Youdun apparently referred to the earlier Yuan text and carried forward the traditional idea that shou is fu as well as lu; his ad- herence to tradition is best exemplified in the sentence, "Those who practise virtue will enjoy 47 For a biography of Zhu Youdun, see DMB, II, pp. 380-81.

As the God of Longevity had been known and accepted since antiquity as a star-god, it was, of course, only proper to assign the same status to Fu and Lu. By the Ming dynasty, the idea of a star-god appearing in an anthropomorphic form was no longer a novelty. It was a standard procedure for the novelist to elevate the status of a protagonist. For example, in the Shuibu Thuan (Tale of the Marshes), a famous novel developed from Song-Yuan folk stories and published in one hundred chapters during the sixteenth century, the io8 bandit heroes are presented as incarnations of two groups of astral gods, the thirty-six major figures as incar- nations of the Thirty-six Stars of Tian Gang (Great Bear) and the others, the Seventy-two Stars of Di Sha (Evil Influences).57 That neither Fu Xing nor Lu Xing possesses a mythical history that can remotely be compared with that of Shou Xing tells us that they were created specifically to form the Fu Lu Shou triad. The term "fu xing" is rare in Chinese literature; its earliest occurrence is found in a Tang poem by Li Shangyin (812-8 58),s8 but it was hardly known afterwards. As to "lu xing," there is no mention of it anywhere. There are, however, legends of Fu Shen (God of Blessings) and Lu Shen (God of Dignitaries) which, as noted by Dord, were derived from Ming-Qing sources. In accordance with the story for Fu Shen in the Zhongreng Soushenfji, the twice enlarged edition of Researches into the Supernatural, he was originally Yang Cheng, a criminal judge from Dao Zhou, Hunan, who having successfully counseled Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 5z02- 5o) to abandon his eccentric drafting of the male dwarfs of Daozhou to become his court comedians, was venerated as a god who brought happiness back to the families there.s0 Lu Shen, as described in the Shenxian tongjian (an encyclopedic collection of biographies of sages, saints, Taoist gods, and the like), was originally Shi Fen, a scholar from Honei (the region north of the Yellow River) who became a high court official in the reign of Emperor Jing (r. I~56-14o B.C.) and was given the honorary title, "Wanshi jun" or Lord of Ten Thousand Piculs.60 Thus, Fu Shen and Lu Shen are simply popularized analogies of Fu Xing and Lu Xing respectively. Once the conception of the Three Stars had taken place, its representation must have followed without much delay. Although most of Zhu Youdun's dramas were published in I433, already in the reign of Emperor Xian Zhong (r. 1426-1436), the last emperor whom he served in his life time, at least two known painters had produced a "San Xing tu", Wang Mengduan, whose biography has not been recorded,6 and Dai Jin (1388-1462), the well-known early s6 MWGCJB gujin Zaju, 37: Qunxian 8 b. 57 Shuihu Zhuan (Beijing: Renmin wenxue chuban she, I975), 111-.975-78. ss Chung-wen ta tZ'u-tien, XXIV.I10o319(25319.63) also states that "fu xing" is another name for Jupiter. 59 Dore, XI (1916), pp. 946-47. I have not been able to locate his reference, the ZhongZeng Soushenji, but the 1909 edition of Sanjiaoyuanliu Soushen daquan, a work based on the Ming enlarged edition of the Yuan Huaxiang Soushen guangji, gives the same story with one change-the emperor concerned is Wu Di of Han rather than Wu Di of Liang; see Sanjiao yuanliu Soushen daquan (I909), IV.3 b-4a. 60 Dore, XII (i918), pp. Io90-91.

In the act where the immortals gathered to view the birthday presents brought to the celebration, a painting of the Three Stars was singled out from among others depicting a variety of longevity themes.63 This literary reference identifies also the motive for the representation of Fu Lu Shou, the fact that it was the most appropriate gift to bring to a birthday celebration. The Tianshui bingshan lu, which records the confiscated treasures of the Grand Secretary, Yan Song (1480o- I 565), and his son, Yan Shifan (1513-1565), lists painting titles such as "Ba Xian qingshou" (The Eight Im- mortals Celebrating Longevity), "Nan Ji chengxiang" (The Old Man Star Offering Felici- tations), Ma Lin's "Fu Lu Shou San Xing tu" (A painting of the Three Stars Fu Lu Shou), and Sheng Zizhao's "San Xing gongshou tu" (A painting of the Three Stars Conferring Lon- gevity).64 Their thematic content is strongly reminiscent of Zhu Youdun's longevity plays and confirms that they were gifts brought to the Yan family for their longevity festivals during their properous days. Evidently, the custom of giving paintings on longevity themes as birthday presents had given no small impetus to the development of the "San Xing tu." But, in the desire to give the new theme the sanction of tradition, some painters willingly substituted the names of old masters, as mentioned above, Ma Lin (Southern Song) or Sheng Zizhao (Yuan), for their own. Such a practice has certainly created much confusion among today's art historians and has led to the erroneous belief that the triad of the Three Stars was known as early as Southern Song.6s As far as is known, the earliest entries accrediting Ma Lin and Song-Yuan masters with depic- tions of the Three Stars are found in the late Ming catalogue, Wangshi shanhuwang huaju (preface, 1643), in which the compiler, Wang Luoyu (fl. I624-1644), states that he derived his infor- mation from the 1565 record of the Yan family paintings.66 Furthermore, Chai (Zhai) Hao, a jin shi scholar of the Qian Long period (1736-I796), while commenting on the Yan family collection that consisted of at least over 3,000 scrolls,67 contended that themes of a laudatory nature were unknown in Song-Yuan times and pointed out that paintings such as those by Ma 62 WSSHW huaju, II, 1.2o00; Yu Jianhua, p. 1453 ; and DMB, II, pp. 1233-34. 63 MWGCJB gujin Zaju, 37: Li Dongbin 7a-b. 64 Tianshui bingshan lu, hereafter TSBS lu, in ZhibuZu Zhai congshu, 4.202a, 208b, and 195 a; and WSSHWhuaju, II, I.197-98, respectively.

Lawton, Freer Gallery of Art Fiftieth Anniversary Exhibition II: Chinese Figure Painting (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institute, 1973), P. 163 states: "Judging from the entries found in catalogues of Chinese painting, the theme of the Three Stars was particularly popular during the Sung dynasty, when such well-known artists as Chao Po-chti (active i2th century), Ma Yian (active late I2th-early 13th century), Ma Lin (active early 13th century) depicted it." However, the two earliest reliable texts that recorded the activities of Southern Song painters do not mention the "Three Stars" as one of their works; see Huaji buyi (finished I298) in Zhongguo meishu lunZhu congkan (Beijing: Renmin meishu chuban she, 1963), 1.3-4 and 2.13-14; and Gujin huajian (written, 1329) in Meishu congkan (Taipei: Chung-hua shu-chu-chii, I956), 1.176. To my knowledge, the earliest records giving the aforementioned attributions are in Ming dynasty texts; see, Yuyi bian in Meishu congshu II, 1.280 (Zhao Boju) and WSSHW huaju, II, 1.188 (Zhao Boju), 195 (Ma Yuan), and 195-96 (Ma Lin).

He also stated that the tradition of giving the "San Xing tu" as a birthday present began only in the Ming dynasty. This applies equally to the tradition of portraying the Three Stras. Known Ming representations of Fu Lu Shou are extremely rare today. The handful of late Ming extant works suggests that in the beginning, before the formulation of the traditional iconography as found in the popular Nian hua depictions (Figs. 19-21), the Three Stars appeared without all of their typical identifying features. For example, in a painting believed to be a work by the late Ming artist, Chen Hongshou (0599-1652), they look like Taoist recluses (Fig. 6); all three are shown attired in the daoyi, the costume seen earlier worn by Shou Xing. One of them, obviously Shou Xing, is shortest in height, has only a relatively high forehead, and holds a long staff in his right hand and the ling zhi in his left. This untitled representation kept in the National Palace Museum, Taiwan, is labeled "San Xing tu."69 A painting in the collection of the Freer Gallery of Art which a recent study titled "The Three Stars" and ascribed to the style of the sixteenth century painter, Zheng Dianxian,70 like- wise portrays all three in one type of costume, the outfit of the retired scholar (Fig. 7). Among them, again Shou Xing is shown with his recognizably short stature, high forehead, beard and moustache, and youthful countenance. In contrast to previous works that picture the three figures against a plain background, this one shows them standing under an old pine tree, a clear reference to the popularized symbolism seen earlier in the representation of Shou Xing alone (Figs. 3 and 5). A third painting, which is now lost, is most remarkable in conception (Fig.8).71 The in- scription on the upper portion consists of four paragraphs, each of which is neither a poem nor a literary composition, but a collection of the one-hundred-script form of a single character, respectively from the right to the left, fu, lu, shou, and xi.7, An additional fascinating feature is that the figures, appearing as if they are rendered in even width ink lines, are actually delineated in strings of tiny repetitions of the characters offu, lu, shou, and xi, each befitting the individual represented. This depiction is, therefore, an important document as it identifies the figures of Fu, Lu, and Shou, and introduces at the same time the idea of xi (joy) in the person of the child shown offering fruits to the gods. Fu Xing, who exemplifies Heaven's endowments, is here shown as a retired scholar-official toying with some flowers, reflecting the familiar theme of Tao Yuanming and his chrysanthe- 68 Chai Hao, 8.87-88. 69 Ku-kung shu-hua lu (Taipei: Commercial Press, 1965), 5.477.

Unusual also is the object in the shape of the Shangjue bronze vessel in his hands. This article, still used as a wine cup in today's Chinese opera, and Fu Xing's long waist- band pendant7s serve to suggest that the representation was based on a scene from a Ming longevity play. This source would possibly also explain the presence of the child to symbolize xi. In Zhu Youdun's "Yaochi Ba Xian qingshou," one of the two attendants of Xi Wang Mu is Jin Tong (Golden Boy) who had the task of ushering in each one of the three astral characters to the audience.76 So, the youngster in the depiction could very well have been an adaptation of Jin Tong. But, shown here as a male child holding a tray which contains a peach as well as a pomegranate, it is evident that the image has already been developed into a popularized version, alluding on the one hand, to the Confucian filial piety virtue of having male offsprings to carry on the family lineage, and on the other, to the felicitation customarily addressed to a newly wedded couple to have as many sons as the seeds of the pomegranate.77 This undated documentary painting was most probably produced during the mid sixteenth century when the celebration of longevity gained widespread popularity among the literary class. Chai Hao, the Qing dynasty scholar, mentioned that the intense interest among scholars to devise as many as one hundred versions of certain auspicious scripts such as the sbou character, began only in the Ming dynasty.78 The "Bai Shou tu" (One Hundred Shou picture) is only one example of such literary creations. Known also from the record of the Yan family treasures, there were the "Bai Fu tu" (One Hundred Fu picture) and the "Bai Lu tu" (One Hundred Lu picture).79 Based on the historical fact that the two Yans were executed in 15 65, it is reasonable to surmise that the newly invented one-hundred-script version of auspicious characters must have been sufficiently established by then for incorporation into the extraordinary portrayal of "Fu Lu Shou Xi." An impressive color woodcut print, formerly in Wang Shucun's collection, which shows some common as well as new features, is also a work of late Ming (Fig.9).so0 In comparison with the last mentioned painting, the Three Stars, though still shown in costumes that at first glance 73 The theme is one of Chen Hongshou's favorites: see J.Cahill, Chinese Painting (Cleveland: The World Publishing Com- pany, 196o), pl. on p. 15 7; and National Palace Museum (Staff), Masterpieces of Chinese Figure Painting in the National Palace Museum (Taipei: National Palace Museum, I973), pl.43. 74 Sancai tubui, p. 1535 (Yifu 2.21 a), and p. I 537 (Yifu 2.25 a) respectively. 7s According to the costume listings in a number of Ming dynasty drama scripts, the same type of outfit was prescribed for all three roles of Fu, Lu, and Shou. It consists of a ruyi hat, a robe trimmed with crane feathers, a long beard and mous- tache, dangling jade pendants, a gui sceptre, and an identification plaque. The only required differentiations for the role of Shou Xing were that his hair, beard and moustache must be white in color and his ruyi hat must be of the "lotus blos- som" type.

Fu Xing is wearing a headcloth of a minor official (later he would be wearing the laorenjin, the headcloth of a retired scholar);s, Lu Xing is equipped with a hu, the ceremonial tablet of a court official; and Shou Xing is holding his peach (a symbol of longevity)s8 high up as if for display, or in a position to be handed over to the nearest youngster with upraised hands. The pomegranate, still attached to its branch, is held by a second child; the presence of two small boys indicates that by this time a greater interest in the idea of xi had developed. Strikingly different, of course, are the star-gods' gorgeous silk robes with patterns of intricate embroideries; the cloud- patterned silk here worn by Lu Xing entered the realm of fashion after Emperor Shi Zong (r. 1I22-1567) decreed its use in I5z28 for high ranking officials.83 The Three Stars, now por- trayed in contemporary court costumes, appear as officially appointed deities; they have been given a social status that is fully acceptable to aristocratic audiences. It is likely, therefore, that this representation was produced for the pleasure of a high ranking official. The skilful work- manship which so carefully reproduces every detail of the figures and their costumes un- doubtedly marks it as a work designed for a well-to-do patron. This conclusion is illustrated by a Qing dynasty work, an embroidered representation of Fu Lu Shou Xi made for a longevity celebration of Emperor Qian Long (Fig. Io).s8 The parallels existing between the two are so striking that it is impossible not to accept the earlier Ming work as a prototype of the Qing embroidery. Stylistic features such as the compositional schema of placing the figures against a plain background; the hierarchic arrangement of having the shortest figures, Shou Xing and the youngsters (now increased to three), in the foreground and the tallest, Lu Xing, in the background; and the clothing of the deities in appropriate con- temporary silks are similar in every respect. Especially convincing are the details of the directed attention of Fu Xing and Lu Xing, the position of the hu tablet, the gesture of Lu Xing's left hand, to mention just a few. As to the reversed posture of Shou Xing, it is quite irrelevant to the point in question. It is obvious that the other two star-gods now fully outfitted as Qing court officials represent the established government or its ruler, the emperor, to whom Shou Xing should offer his felicitious wishes of longevity. The change of posture, then, is nothing more than an adjustment done out of deference to Emperor Qian Long. However, neither one of these two depictions for the upper class shows the final version of the popular iconography of the Three Stars wherein Lu Xing is flanked by Fu Xing standing in the foreground, on the right, and Shou Xing, on his left, as seen in the three early twentieth century Nian hua representations (Figs. i9-zi). The evidence for this significant change in iconographic formulation will be drawn from the only surviving examples which include expressions in popularized art (stone-relief rubbing, woodcut illustration, and porcelain deco- ration) as well as traditional painting. Apparently the influence which contributed decisively to the standardized formula came 81 Xu Muyun, Zhongguo xiju shi (Shanghai: Shijie shuju, 1938), 4.250; and Qi Rushan, Guojujianyao tu'an (Beiping: Beiping guoju xuehui, I935), section II, illustrations of headdress. 82 As a popular symbol of longevity, the peach became an emblem of the God of Longevity; see Chung-hua min-su pan-hua, pls. on pp. 66-71. s3 Ming shi, 67.7a-b. s4 National Palace Museum (Staff), Masterpieces of Chinese Silk Tapestry and Embroidery in the National Palace Museum (Taipei: National Palace Museum, I971), pl.43. 19o</page><page sequence="33">from the late Ming traditional painting of the "San Jiao tu" (The Three Doctrines). The telltale feature is the Yin Yang symbol, an emblem of two interlocking light and dark comma shapes, each of which is accented by a dot in its complementary color at the center of its circular section.85 It is found for example in two Ming works, a stone relief representation of the Three Stars preserved today in a rubbing (Fig. II)86 and a painting titled "Scholars Studying the Symbol of the Yin and Yang Principles" (Fig. I2).87 The latter is clearly incorrectly identified, for the figure with the tall pointed head is obviously Shou Xing and, moreover, his characteristic animal symbols, the deer and crane, are included in the composition. These two works, though in different media, portray essentially the same theme, the Three Stars with the Yin-Yang symbol. Ming-Qing popular art assigns this symbol, which is gener- ally placed at the center of a diagram of the Eight Trigrams, to the mythical Fu Xi, the first of the San Huang rulers,88 or Pan Gu, the first offspring of the interaction of Yin and Yang,89 depending on which was upheld as the first ancestor of man. The attribute was also ascribed to Lao Zi, the founder of Taoism.)o Now, it is given to the God of Longevity, as confirmed by a Ming embroidery which shows him displaying a Yin-Yang Scroll while descending from the heavens on a white crane (Fig. I3).91 The association of the Yin-Yang symbol with Shou Xing in a representation of the Three Stars suggests a close relationship, first of all, on an individual basis, between Shou Xing and Lao Zi and, secondly, on a more general basis, between the "San Xing tu" and the "San Jiao tu." For the first instance, it is necessary to consider the significance of the Yin-Yang symbol. Invented as a diagrammatical summation of Chinese thinking on the interactions of the Yin and Yang principles that produced the universe, it is also known as the "Tai Zhi Tu" (Great Ultimate Diagram).9z It had represented a basic tenet in Chinese philosophy ever since Neo- Confucianism was introduced in the Song dynasty. As illuminated by Zhou Dunyi (10o17-1073) in his Zai Zhi diagram and discourses,93 the symbol is synonymous with Tao (Way) or, in the terminology of Taoist metaphysics, "the all-embracing first principle for all things."p- In the Ming dynasty when Tao, originally the focus of the Taoist classic, Daodejing, was adapted to s85 The Yin-Yang symbol is believed to have been first produced in the tenth century (early Song); see, S.Cammann, "The Magic Square of Three in Old Chinese Philosophy and Religion," History of Religions, I, I (196I), p. 77.

Consequently, Lao Zi, who since late Han was proclaimed by religious Taoists as the progenitor of this world, was depicted holding the Yin-Yang symbol.97 Two known examples, perhaps among the earliest, are the woodcut prints of the "San Jiao tu" produced in the late Ming as illustrations to the Taoist texts, Xingming guighi (Fig. 14)98 and Yuyuzi neiwai pian (Fig. I~5).99 Lao Zi, whose depiction in the latter is evidently a refinement of the previous one, is shown here in his philosophical aspect, "the beginning of all things," and is seen as eternal or, in Chinese popular connotation, as an immortal. Now, Shou Xing is likewise an immortal; Zhu Youdun considered him a "Xian guan'" an Immortal- or Celestial-Official in his drama, discussed above. He was also numbered among the residents of the Isle of Peng Lai in the famous novel, Xiyoufji (Journey to the West) by Wu Chengen (c. I500oo-c. I582).oo Since Lao Zi and Shou Xing shared the same status, it certainly was not inappropriate to equate one with the other. Turning to the question of the relationship between the "San Xing tu" and the "San Jiao tu," a clue appears on a famille verte plate (Fig. I6)?Io which, as far as is known, is the only surviving early Qing prototype of the popular Nian hua Fu Lu Shou icons. The exquisite por- celain design indicates that it must have been a rare memento produced for an imperial lon- gevity celebration. The wide border, which consists of alternating vignettes of the deer and the crane, characterizes it as a "birthday plate," a famous type believed to have been made for the sixtieth birthday of Emperor Kang Xi (r. x662-1722).102 There is no evidence that this piece was made for him, but the exceptionally high quality of achievement in the rendering of the Three Stars denotes the hand of an expert artist. The original painting, that is, the model for the porcelain depiction, must have been executed by a well-informed painter; he has not only demonstrated a strong lineage to traditional painting by having the figures placed "under a tree" but has also enlarged upon the significance of shou by several repetitions of the animal symbols of longevity. Like the well-known painter, Ding Yunpeng, who incorporated popular art idioms into his woodcut of "Shou Xing" for a book illustration (Fig. 3), he similarly created a "Fu Lu Shou" for a porcelain decoration. Judging from the addition of a third creature (a bat, pronouncedfu in Chinese, a homonym of the happinessfu),lo03 which enabled the symbolism 95 R.Taylor, "Ming T'ai-tsu and the Gods of Walls and Moats," Ming Studies, III, Spring 1977, PP- 35-37. 96 J.A.

It seems that the "birthday plate" custom originated in late Ming. A Wanli polychrome porcelain dish in the National Palace Museum, Taiwan, is decorated with the images of Fu Lu Shou (all three clothed in the dao-yi robes) in the center and the stylized shou character, repeated eight times amidst a meandering floral pattern, around the wide border; see Porcelain of the National Palace Museum: Enamelled Ware of the Ming, III (Hong Kong: Cafa Co., 1966), XVII, pls. 2zI-21 a. The border design of this ceramic piece is exactly the same as that on the Wanli polychrome porcelain plate which depicts Shou Xing and the Eight Immortals; see n.44. 103 Nozaki, pp. 55-63 (Nos. I3-15). Iqz</page><page sequence="35">of Fu Lu Shou to be so neatly underscored by the presence of the bat, deer, and crane respec- tively, the portrayal of the Three Stars has, by now, reached its peak of development. Such an achievement is borne out by the fact that each one of the Three Stars is depicted in his typical identity, just as they appear in the later Nian hua woodcut prints. Fu Xing, who is clad in the simple outfit of a retired scholar-official (plain headcloth and unadorned wide- sleeved robe) and who is holding a child in his arms, exemplifies the popular notion that hap- piness consists in having a son.o04 In contrast Lu Xing wears the court costume of a high ranking official which features a zhanjiaofotou (a two-stepped square hat with long and narrow wing-like projections on the sides)Ios and a round-collared robe embellished with the square rank insignia over chest and back (the latter is not shown),Io6 thus, symbolizing one who has won a high position in the imperial government. Shou Xing is portrayed with all of his iden- tifying features; the medallion with a crane motif on his outer robe merely indicates that he is an "Immortal-Official." Clearly, this version of the Three Stars shows a highly developed iconography. Yet, the most significant aspect of the entire composition is the placement of the three figures in an arrangement which is prototypical of the Nian hua iconography. The triangular structure of the three star-gods is basically related to that of the three religious founders in the "San Jiao tu" such as in an anonymous painting belonging to the Nelson Gallery of Art, Kansas City (Fig. x 7).I7 This painting, as verified by a woodcut rendition in the ink-cake album, Fangshi mopu (Fig. i8), is no doubt a late Ming work.l0s In comparison with the Southern Song "Three Doctrines" (Fig.4), it is evident that the late Ming depiction has incorporated two important changes in iconography. Sakyamuni, who in the earlier work occupied the apex position in the triangular grouping of the three, has exchanged places with Confucius; and Lao Zi, who previously stood a few steps diagonally behind Confucius, has been moved forward to stand on the same base line as GSakyamuni in the foreground. Although the informality of the triangular group lacks hierarchic clarity, it is apparent that Confucius is standing in a central position and is flanked by Sakyamuni and Lao Zi in the lower foreground. This new iconog- raphy, as one art historian has noted, reflects the current philosophy of Lin Zhao'en's syn- cretic movement which had "Confucianism as its principal doctrine and Buddhism and Taoism as its subsidiary teachings."''o? It also illustrates Ming Taizu's view of the three teachings, "Confucianism is the Way of yang or manifest virtue ... Taoism and Buddhism are yin, or hidden virtue." ,1o It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the many schools of thought in the Ming dynasty but it suffices to say that with syncretism reaching an apogee in the late Ming, the creators of popular art, many of whom belonged to the literary class, such as Dai 104 In New Year pictures, Fu Shen is depicted with a male child at his feet or by his side. 10s Sancai tuhui, p. 1543 (Yifu 2.37a-b). o06 For an excellent study on the square rank insignia of court officials, see S.Cammann, "The Development of the Man- darin Square," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, VIII, 1944-45, PP. 71-130.

The "Three Stars" on thefamille verte plate is but one example that has survived to our time. It is not known exactly when the original sketch for the birthday plate was made, but based on the style of the costumes which is characteristically Ming rather than Qing, and on the evidence that early versions of the "San Xing tu" were still being produced in the latter part of the sixteenth century, one is inclined to believe that it was executed during early seventeenth century Ming. In this light, the close relationship between the two sets of triads become obvious; the triangular structure of Sakyamuni, Confucius and Lao Zi is subsumed in the grouping together of Fu Xing, Lu Xing and Shou Xing. SIkyamuni's enlightment, Confucius' teachings, and Lao Zi's Way have become, as it were, the popularized ideals of happiness, emolument, and longevity respectively. These arguments are substantiated in an early twentieth century (late Qing or Early Repub- lic) Nian hua belonging to the National Museum of History, Taiwan, which shows the "San Xing tu" in its most fully developed stage (Fig. 19). 1 Here, the three deities have been con- solidated into the format of an icon, that is, having Lu Xing shown in a stiff and frontally oriented hierarchic pose in the center and the other two, in complementary but flanking posi- tions in the foreground. Of primary import is that here are no major changes in the com- positional structure of the triad. The use of bright colors and the ornately decorated costumes are characteristic of late Qing Nian hua art.,1 Also typical of the Nian hua pictorial vocabulary are the additional auspicious symbols: the peony flower (which symbolizes abundant bless- ings) 113 attached to the headdress of Fu Xing, the ruyi sceptre (fulfillment of one's most desired wishes)"114 replacing the bu tablet of Lu Xing, and the hu lu gourd (a reservoir of the elixir of immortality) ,s hanging by the side of the handscroll on Shou Xing's staff. All of them are mere conventions of popular art and are unrelated to the significance of Fu Lu Shou. Therefore, it is clear that this triad has, at this point, been entirely subsumed by the vernacular culture. Obviously this work is the product of a popular art workshop. It contains stylistic qualities and expressions associated with one of the most successful centers of Nian hua art, Yangliuqing in Hebei. The decorative effect of the colorful mosaic patterning has not obscured the refine- ment of the deities' faces, which are rendered with carefully modeled fleshy and rosy tones. This method of enlivening the color woodcut print with a final touch by hand was a standard pro- cedure at Yangliuqing."6 The goal during its heyday of production was to elevate Nian hua to a level comparable with traditional painting. Among the outstanding painters who assisted the Yangliuqing workshop, the best known is the expert portraitist, Gao Yinzhang, alias Tongxuan (1835- 906). At the age of thirty-two he was invited by the Qing court to paint a portrait of the Empress Dowager Ci Xi (I835-I908).17 The legacy of the influence from rx Chung-hua min-supan-hua, pl. on p. 68. According to a specialist in the art of Nian hua, Ye Youxin (Assistant Director of the Research Institute of Industrial Arts in Shandong), whom I had the pleasure of meeting during his visit in the United States, it is most likely that this work belongs to the tradition of Yangliuqing. 12 A Ying, pp. 16 and 24-25. 113 Nozaki, pp. 295-305 (Nos.76-78). i4 One of the most common good wishes is "Wanshi ruyi" (May all your wishes come true); see, Nozaki, p. 19 (No.4). 1s National Palace Museum (i97I), pl.28; and Nozaki, p. 174. 1x6 Wang Shucun, p. 2. 17 Wang Shucun, "Minjian huashi Gao Tongxuan he ta di nianhua," IVenwu, 1952, no.2, pp. i9-22.

The persistence of the mature iconography of Fu Lu Shou is also found in a representation of the same type, but probably of a slightly later date, from Taohuawu in Suzhou, Jiangsu (Fig. o20).n9 Its hierarchic composition, placement of the three figures, and ornate costumes are close enough parallels to justify a common source of origin. The slight turn of Lu Xing's head to the left, rather than its standard frontal position, is not an accidental detail. It indicates that the work was designed as one of a pair made to be placed, like Door Gods,,2o on the double- paneled doors of Chinese houses. The pair of "San Xing tu" fromWeixian, Shandong (Fig. 2-),2'- which a workshop in the same county makes available today as reproductions of late Qing (or early Republic) models, is a typical example of the latter type. While the depiction on the right has virtually retained the iconography seen in the example in Taiwan, the one on the left is merely the same image in reverse. There is no question that the iconography of Fu Lu Shou portrayed in the Nian hua art form is the standardized version. Indeed, the Fu Lu Shou triad in its fully developed iconography is found today only in a few examples of early twentieth century Nian hua color woodcut prints. The beginning of this category of popular art, as suggested in a contemporary text,,-zz and confirmed by a recent discovery,123 occurred in the Northern Song. However, it was not until the late Ming, during the Chong Zheng period (1628-1644), when stimulated in no small measure by the great strides achieved in the field of woodcut illustration for novels, dramas, painting manuals, and other literary texts, that a full blossoming took place, first, at Yangliuqing and then, by the major centers of Weixian and Suzhou.x24 The three examples available for this study belong respectively to the traditions of these three famous Nian hua art centers. Their geographic separation does not account for any differences in basic pictorial conception, a fact which proves the wide- 1's See the color plates in Wang Shucun's publication on Yangliuqing cited in n.23.

Recent studies on the art of Nian hua have pointed out that trained personnel from the pres- tigious Yangliuqing center assisted in the establishment of the workshop at Weixian.126 It is obvious, therefore, that the unique iconography of Fu Lu Shou, already formulated and established by the late Ming when Yangliuqing was on the rise as an important center of Nian hua art, was adopted literally for reproduction by other workshops. Conclusion Of all the popular gods in Ming-Qing China, Fu Lu Shou were among the greatest favorites of the people. Although they first appeared as a triad in art and literature produced for the upper echelons of society, they were soon accepted by all social classes, the literary elite as well as the working masses. The inherent auspicious characterizations of the star-gods may have promoted their attrac- tiveness at first, but fundamentally it is their non-sectarian status which contributed to their immense popularity. They have been considered immortals belonging to the supernatural world, even described in the Journey to the West as having made their domicile on the Isle of Peng Lai, but they have never been recognized as true Taoist deities; they are not listed among the gods of the Taoist pantheonsI2 and are not even included in the Shenxian zhuan (Biography of Immortals).I28 As gods who evolved and materialized outside the institutionalized religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and the State, they have never been assigned a miao (temple) or ci (sanctuary) of a specific religious affiliation.129 Yet, they were honored at longevity celebrations, proving that they are ipsofacto gods of a popular cult of the people. It is because of this reason, I believe, that the triad is represented in a wide variety of artistic media, as shown in the examples assembled for this study. Many more would have been preserved if there had not been an imbalance in Chinese art appreciation, an excessive patronage of traditional painting over that of popular art. The non-sectarian character of the triad also accounts for the incorporation of influences from traditional as well as popular art in shaping its pictorial configuration. The evolution of its iconography, as demonstrated in this study, indicates such a combination of diverse elements and, also that the line of demarcation between the scholar-painter and the professional artist- craftsman in the Ming-Qing period was not so adamantly upheld as one might believe. For example, Ding Yunpeng, whose works were admired by Dong Qichang (I5y 5-I-W636), one of the famous initiators of the theories of the Northern and Southern schools of Chinese painting, oo x25s A distinctive difference between the Nian hua art of the two centers is that while the artists at Yangliuqing preferred to add touch-up colors to the human faces by hand, those at Weixian relied totally on the printing process for all of the detailed features; see Xu Zhi, "Weixian nianhua," in Zbongguo kedi nianhuayanjiu (1976), p. 68. 126 Wang Bomin, p. 171; and A Ying, p. 28. 127 See, Li Shu-huan comp.

Neither did he hesitate to adopt the popular art idioms of the deer and crane into his representation of Shou Xing. The remarkable portrayal of Fu Lu Shou on thefamille verte porcelain plate is a perfect illustration of a successful amalgamation of tradition painting and popular art. The most striking area in which the cooperative venture of traditional and popular artists has made history is in color woodcut print-making. While black and white woodcuts designed by leading painters were reproduced by artist-craftsmen for book illustrations, color woodcuts of famous painting were made for the pleasure of the upper class. Typical examples of the latter are the late Ming woodcuts of Shou Xing (Figs. I and 5) and Fu Lu Shou (Fig.9). Soon the themes of such reproductions also attracted the attention of the peasant and merchant classes and the awareness that their demands had to be met stimulated the creation of a new popular art form. Those professional artists, who had the experience of making color woodcut repro- ductions from traditional paintings, applied their expertise to produce comparable prints for the masses. From these efforts, the category of popular art known as Nian hua or New Year picture came into existence. Most significantly, it is this off-shoot of the art of color woodcut print-making that has preserved some of the most vital art themes, including the Three Stars, Fu Lu Shou.
