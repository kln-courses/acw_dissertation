<plain_text><page sequence="1">William A. Jenkins The Future of Children's Books Introduction What is the predictable future of chil- dren's literature? What will children's read- ing habits be ten years from now, and what are the foreseeable changes in publishing trends? Will paperbound books and book clubs play a greater role in the children's field than they do now? In what areas do publishers feel they are most successful and where do they feel they must make the greatest changes to serve better this very important reading market? To whom and to what do publishers credit their successes and their failures in the children's field? The Study In an attempt to answer these and other important questions about the children's field, publishers- that is, children's and ju- venile editors- were polled. As far as they are willing to reveal their feelings and ideas about their publishing habits and plans, and admittedly publishing is a busi- ness that must be cloaked in some degree of secrecy, here is their thinking. The valid- ity of the editors' remarks must also reside in whatever statistical and analytical biases that have been worked into their responses. The study is based on a questionnaire which was sent to 121 publishers listed as working in the children's and juvenile field in the 1962-63 Literary Market Place. Fifty questionnaires were returned to the writer, forty-four of which were completed. Of the forty-four returned, thirty-two of the edi- Dr. Jenkins is a Professor of Education and Asso- ciate Dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.

In general the ques- tionnaire was directed to "What predict- able changes in the children's book field do you feel qualified to comment on?" Because of the limited number of re- turns, the results are open to statistical challenge, but the comments of the various children's editors should be indicative of what the field is thinking and it should provide comments about the field of which librarians and teachers should be aware. Among the respondents, both the very smallest publishing houses and the largest are represented. Table I Number of Children's Books Published Each Year by Bespondents to Questionnaire Number of Books Number of Published Annually Respondents 1-5 5 5-10 5 10 - 25 19 25- 50 9 50 -100 3 101 or more 1 No response 2 The publishers indicate that in recent years the number of books which they have published has increased only slightly. Statistics, however, do not agree with their opinions. The total number of children's books being published each year is increas- ing considerably. The Library Journal (3) reports that "In 1962, the number of new titles of children's books published jumped to over 2,000; in 1963 they passed 2,500; and this year [19641 indicates a matching, if not increasing, output." Most of the respondents indicated that they publish for all age groups but a great many also publish for the middle-grade child. The youngest child and the adoles- 502</page><page sequence="2">The Future of Children's Books 503 cent seem to be two groups for which a relatively small number of books are pub- lished. Table II Reading Levels for Which Publishers Publish Youngest Child 7 Middle-Grade Child 16 Older Child 12 Adolescents 7 All Age Groups 23 Teachers have felt for many years that the best books for children have been writ- ten for the middle-grade child. Analyses of lists of books that have been judged meri- torious, such as the Newbery books, seem to corroborate this feeling. Books in the adolescent group have tended to lack liter- ary quality, while many books for the youngest child can only be called "pretty." The editors indicate that in the next ten years they expect the yearly increase of titles published to remain about the same. Editors View the Future In commenting on future increases, the editors pointed to increased foreign mar- kets, increasing public interest in children's reading, and expanding school and library markets and budgets as bases for future, predictable growth. The great number who indicated that their business would remain constant, generally based maintenance of the status quo on the number of titles which their present staff and sales force could handle adequately, their ability to find good manuscripts, and the difficulty in maintaining an inventory. Several publish- ers indicated that they have decided on the size of their children's lists and would devote their time and energies to maintain- ing them. Significantly, the editors were optimistic about the future. Perhaps this is the way they should feel, for some of the most dramatic publishing stories in recent years have come from the children's field. These include reports of publishing houses that have been kept afloat or blown out of the doldrums by the vigorous activity of their juvenile departments. The influence of the children's trade field is even more impres- sive when one recalls that the first chil- dren's department in a publishing house was established less than half a century ago (10). Publishers are aware that there are more and will be even more children, that they are reading more and using libraries more, and that their parents are aware of the values of owning and reading books. Perhaps these are reasons only one editor predicted decreased activity for his firm in this field. Ruth Hill Viguers (13) beautifully ex- pressed optimism about the future of chil- dren's books at a library conference last summer: This is one thing we can be sure of in the future: the unchanging quality of childhood itself, regardless of place. The child who begins his life in New York City or Nepal, or Johannesburg will need food, love, and security, and will respond to sound and suspense. Knowing this, when we speculate about the future, we need consider only the influence of adults . . . children's librarians will emerge to temper that influence. Table III indicates that in all six cate- gories listed in the questionnaire there have been increased requests by the pur- chasers of children's books. Trade books in general show a dramatic increase, but so does the easy-to-read book for beginning readers. The effect of increased purchases is illustrated in Table IV which indicates publishing increases. The relationship be- tween sales and releases seems to be a direct one.</page><page sequence="3">504 Elementary English Table 1П Recent Changes in Children's Book Purchasès Noted by Publishers Number Number Number Responses Responses Responses Type of Book Increase Decrease No Change Children's Trade Books 25 3 7 Biography 17 4 6 Science 27 1 2 Other Non-Fiction 19 3 6 Picture Books for Young Children 16 5 7 Easy-to-Read Beginning Readers 25 1 5 Table IV Recent Changes in Children's Books Published Number Indicating Number Indicating Area of Greatest Area of Greatest Type of Book Increase Decrease Children's Trade Books 6 2 Biography 2 1 Science 16 1 Other Non-Fiction 3 0 Picture Books for Young Children 4 3 Easy-to-Read Be- ginning Readers 10 0 Why Publish a Book? Attempting to find out what influences publishing firms to publish a given chil- dren's book, I asked the editors to indicate from among ten different sources of in- fluence, those factors which have the greatest bearing on their decision to pub- lish certain types of books. From their re- sponses it is quite clear that librarians' requests for a book or type of book influ- ence decisions more than teachers' requests. Market analyses of children's reading hab- its-the Madison avenue stereotype- and publishing trends in other countries have little bearing on whether a given title is published in this country. Siri Andrews, editor of children's books for Holt (1), has commented this way on librarians' influence: Librarians are the largest book buyers and have the widest influence, through their own buying as well as through their own contacts with a reading and book-buying public. What seemed so obvious to me as the study was undertaken- that children follow their parents' habits, such as favoring the reading of biography- may be only an il- lusion. Reviewers of children's books also seem not too influential. The results are summarized in Table V.

Significantly, in both tables librarians' and teachers' requests are rated as strong influences in the decision making process.

She writes that it began with Eugene Saxton's asking Anne Carroll Moore to review W. H. Hudson's Little Boy Lost for the November, 1918, issue of the Bookman. In 1924 Miss Moore was asked to edit a weekly paper of criticism of children's books for Herald- Tribune Books. According to Eaton, as Miss Moore watched the five owls who sat on the weathervane outside of the Children's Library in Westbury, Long Island, three of them flew away. Thus was born "The Three Owls" of children's literature: the artist, the author, and the critic. 1 ) Anthropomorphic animal tales which are neither fact nor fable. 2) Poor plots which are loosely put to- gether, pointless, or contrived; wooden characters; or lessons of brotherhood pushed too hard. 3) Too adultish, with too few child associa- tions. On the other side, Miss Jones lists these as reasons for accepting a manuscript: 1 ) The story's the thing. 2) A known author whose previous sales record indicates that the book will be accepted. 3) Subject needed for balance. 4) Thematic interest and author promise. Predictable Changes The publishers were asked to indicate significant predictable changes in the chil- dren's book field of which they are aware. A wide variety of changes which are occur- ring now were included. For example, one publisher felt that there is a definite trend toward good science books for children. Another indicated that children's books have more realism. Still another lamented the fact that there is an increasing number of titles available and a decreasing quality in many books. An editor felt that more and more paper- back books will be published. A colleague mentioned the fact that institutional mar- kets are growing faster than trade markets because all ajges are reaching for and de- manding material beyond their standard age group, influenced by better educated parents and by television. Schools are mov- ing away from one-text teaching, toward a basic skills text in a galaxy of supplemen- tary trade books and reading materials. Interesting explanations for this condi- tion have been offered by Vernon Ives (7). He says, (a) publishers prefer to publish authors, not books, for even a bad book by an established author is easier to sell than a new book; (b) when a publisher makes a large advance royalty to an author he is</page><page sequence="5">506 Elementary English under financial obligation to sell a poorly finished product; (c) orders "from above" in a publishing firm to publish "a delightful little fairy tale" by Joe So-and-So's daughter (especially when a novel by Joe may be put under contract) have to be carried out; and (d) publishers, like everyone else, jump on the bandwagon and publish books, often bad, on topics which everyone is dis- cussing at the moment. Ives feels that the only brake on publishers is increasing costs, but these also prevent many good books from being published. Frank Stevens (12) also has offered reasons for inferior books: (a) books published according to formulas; (b) series books which capitalize on earlier successful efforts; (c) vocabulary books, based on word count; and (d) sales pro- motion techniques. One can only hope the prediction, that there will be massive overproduction of junk which will reach a saturation point, soon will come true. The hope was voiced that in the near future there will be more books on the arts, books of fantasy, good fiction, and poetry which children will start reading. Several editors felt that there would be less controlled vocabulary, while an equal number indicated that controlled vocabulary in children's books would re- main for the foreseeable future. Design Changes To this question, "Are there significant predictable changes in the design of chil- dren's books?" those answering affirmative- ly included among the predictable changes "impressionistic" jacket design; improve- ment in illustrations as new illustrators enter the field from other media; better art along with better quality, more colors, and more "sophisticated" layout and design. These editors also mentioned that teen- agers require "adult-looking" books. Con- temporary design in illustrations and ty- pography will increase, one editor noted, while another indicated that abstract art work would be within the covers of more books for children. In various places several editors pointed to the increase in quality of bindings for children's books. They indicated that this would both increase and decrease the pos- sible flexibility in design of the books. The influence would increase or diminish, de- pending upon whether they felt innova- tions were fads or whether they repre- sented genuine changes. The development of new materials will open up greater de- sign possibilities, they felt, but "the avant- garde-for-its-own sake design has about had its day." In general it must be said that the editors felt that the significant de- sign changes would occur through an in- crease in color, better bindings, and better layout. The Future of Paperbacks In answer to whether paperbound books for children will develop to proportions similar to those for adult readers during the past decade, twenty-one editors indi- cated that in their opinion they would not, fifteen indicated they would, and eight did not respond. When asked what in their opinion is the most significant change occurring at the moment in children's literature, the editors surprisingly enough pointed to no sensa- tional technological or economic develop- ments. Rather they listed such things as the great demand for a product which is superior in every way. They pointed to an increase in appreciation of the truly literary book, the upswing to literature and away from the trivial, their awareness of the impoverished vocabulary and content of many books on the market, and the influ- ence of a curriculum which demands re- lated subjects in trade juveniles. The Effect of Reading Controversies The editors and publishers were asked</page><page sequence="6">The Future of Children's Books 507 whether their publishing programs had been affected by reading controversies which occurred in the past ten years. Twenty-eight indicated that they had not. In a large measure they had foreseen some of the weaknesses in reading and provided materials to meet these needs. They do not publish books with limited vocabularies and therefore were apart from the con- troversy. Some felt that people are getting fed up with "graded" readers which are far below the child's level of intellectual maturity and sophistication. Interestingly enough, one editor indicated that his firm started the "I Can Read" books when they found that public libraries were buying primers from textbook houses. On the positive side, an editor indicated that as a result of the reading controversies his house had sold more trade books to schools and libraries and had put more and more of their trade books in sturdy bind- ings to serve as readers. Another editor indicated that the frenzy for easy reading material had led his company to consider vocabulary more carefully, although as a policy they did not believe in word lists. An editor decried the fact that his com- pany had a difficult time selling one of their really fine books to libraries because the purchasing people couldn't decide ex- actly for which grade it should be bought. Children's Book Clubs In the main the editors felt that chil- dren's book clubs will not influence chil- dren's future reading fare. This won't happen because, in the words of one editor, subscriptions to book clubs are less wel- come to children than they were twenty years ago. Another editor indicated that book clubs are waning and that they have never influenced habits. He views them as the refuge of the literarily lazy. He pointed out that adult reading habits are not influ- enced to a large extent by reading clubs. Adults who read extensively are more like- ly to select paperbacks of their choosing than join a reading club, and this will also be true of children. The results are shown in Table VIII. Table VIII Publishers' Predictions on Future Influence of Children's Book Clubs Number indicating that book clubs will influence children's future reading fare 13 Number indicating that book clubs will not influence children's future reading fare 19 No response 12 Number indicating that book clubs will in- fluence to a greater extent children's future reading fare 9 Number indicating that book clubs will in- fluence to a lesser degree children's fu- ture reading fare 8 No response 27 The Role of Illustrations The editors felt that in the future illus- trations will play about the same role in children's books as they do at the present time. Several editors felt that a few years ago more illustrations were demanded for children's books, that the demand is now being met, and that content is presently more important. Great strides have been made in book illustrations, but publishers can afford no more without price increases that the market would resist. The quality and kind of text has been the determining factor in arriving at the kind of illustrations to be used. He felt that this practice would hold true in the future as well. Illustrating children's books is a highly competitive business and the increased complexity of subject matter in areas such as science, re- quires more and better illustrations. All in all, the feelings of the editors about illus- trations may be summed up in the words of one who said, "We cannot afford to do more- and we dare not do less." The Future of Illustrations The editors were asked whether the illus-</page><page sequence="7">508 Elementary English trators under contract to their publishing houses recently had shown a shift in in- terest in the media that they employ in illustrating children's books. While it is difficult to categorize their replies, some comments are noteworthy. A significant number felt that no change in illustrating media is on the horizon. Others indicated, however, that artists whom they work with have long experimented with all media and that they are constantly trying new ap- proaches such as collages, preseparations, and so on. The medium to be used by the artist is determined by cost and subject matter, which factors lead one to believe that many illustrators illustrate books only upon contract and only by a prescription for each book. Several publishers indicated that they contract an artist whose tech- niques are most suitable, according to the publishers interpretation, for illustrating a given manuscript. Possibly the most posi- tive conclusion which can be drawn from this question is that most children's illus- trators are free lance artists rather than house illustrators. Factors Adversely Affecting Reading The editors felt strongly that parents' lack of awareness of what is available and teachers' lack of knowledge about chil- dren's books were the two conditions most adversely affecting their efforts to provide children with good books. They pointed out that bookstores have a lack of aware- ness of what is available and inadequate personnel to sell what is on hand; dancing and music lessons, school activities, and so on, compete with children's reading time; and, parents fail to encourage children to read and stimulate in them the love of reading. Table IX Cultural Conditions Adversely Affecting Publishers' Efforts to Provide Children with Good Books Relative Number Rank Factor Influence Responses 1 Parents' lack of aware- ness of what is available 168 13 2 Teacher's lack of aware- ness of what is available 119 23 3 Rising book costs 112 25 4 The flood of poor qual- ity books in supermar- kets, etc. 96 24 5 Competition from other media 66 31 6 Children's poor reading habits 51 32 7 Librarians' lack of awàre- ness of what is available 44 37 8 Children's lack of read- ing ability 38 33 The strongest view, as we suspected, was voiced about books for adolescents. One editor pointed out that it isn't easy to find writers who can provide really first-rate books for this age group. Another pointed out that adolescents' tastes change fast. Their interest in extra-curricular reading runs a hard second to their social preoc- cupation with learning how to look and act grown up, and they simply will not look twice at anything that smacks of juvenility. The result is that the market for books which would interest them is too small to publish profitably alone. Adolescents read adult books because they find writing spe- cifically published for them inadequate. The "older" child is often in a never-never land insofar as reading ability goes. For this reason he wants books as nearly adult as they can be, while a few of them want nothing more challenging than mystery stories. A further explanation is that young adult books are knotty problems to edit and to market. To a correlative question, "For which age group are publishers providing the best books?" the editors were equally far</page><page sequence="8">The Future of Children's Books 509 from consensus. Fifteen felt that the young- est child was being given the best books, but twenty-two did not respond to this question. Seven felt that the best books were being provided both for the middle- grade and for the older child.0 The Future of Easy-to-Read Books To the question of whether or not there will be an increase in the near future in easy-to-read books, such as The Cat in the Hat , the editors indicated by numbers of twenty-seven to fourteen that there would be such an increase. Three editors did not comment upon this question. One editor indicated that the number of easy-to-read books in the future will prob- ably decrease even though there will be a continuing need. In his opinion, the num- ber presently available in print would con- tinue to be available. A second editor in- dicated that the book industry is a great copier of success. Entertaining, non-formu- la stories in simple words are proving at- tractive to both adults and children. Since children know more complex words and syntax at younger ages than in former years, and because they are exposed to television and more adult reading material, the demand will stay high. Opposing this view was that of an editor who felt that the market currently had reached the satu- ration point. Learning about Books The editors were asked which of the various media are the most effective for informing parents, teachers, and librarians about new children's books. There was an unevenness of response to the question, but they felt clearly that book fairs and reviews *In 1958 De Angelo (5) predicted that editors would give more attention to books for the middle age group of children. The prediction, based on reports from juvenile editors, apparently has not yet fully been realized. in the lay press are the primary means for informing parents. Reviews in professional journals and book fairs are the most im- portant means for informing teachers, while librarians receive notice of new books primarily through reviews in profes- sional journals and advertisements in them. They felt that exhibits of books, such as state travelling exhibits, convention dis- plays, and readily available review copies also inform librarians. They point out that at the ALA meetings and the state meet- ings of library groups, publishers have dis- plays which the librarians do notice. They also ask that schools of education where future teachers ought to be made aware of children's trade books acquire, perhaps for curriculum libraries, holdings for the stu- dents to peruse. They noted that good courses in children's literature also make future teachers well aware of what is avail- able. As far as parents are concerned, they also indicated that television programs which mention children's books are quite influential, as are teachers who strongly urge parents to obtain books for their chil- dren. Their views of the means of inform- ing teachers, librarians, and parents of new books are condensed in Table X.

One editor indicated that his firm had just used a new camera for a full-color process picture book which gives a 90 percent reproduction of the original art work at present costs (the cost is high). This is a distinct advantage, how- ever, because the previous method, almost as costly, provided only a 60 to 75 percent reproduction. The Wish Worker was the first hardbound children's book to use this method, according to this editor. Printing on plastic may open up many new avenues of illustrating children's books and influence the design of books. In this regard, Viguers (13) comments that two major changes in the looks of books are discernible: The first is beneficial: consistent effort has been made to dignify good books with ap- propriately attractive format. The second is harmful: indiscriminate publication of chil- dren's books has sponsored the providing of spectacular, eye-catching format to text quite lacking in essence. This deceit has been a cause for the equating of books with dullness. . . . Manuscript Acceptance Very interesting results were received from the editors in response to the ques- tion, "What are the most important criteria used by your readers and editors in de- termining whether a manuscript will or will not be accepted for publication?" The most frequent question that the editors asked themselves is whether children will like the book. But they also refer to need of the subject; its honesty; the capability of au- thor; strength of plot; or interest of instruc- tion (for non-fiction) as important ques- tions. One editor put it very simply: "A good story and good literary style." An- other editor indicated that he asks him- self whether the story has intrinsic merit, whether it will be commercially profitable, and whether it will add prestige to his company's list. A colleague indicated that readability, accuracy, and the fact that the book is not written down to children are his important considerations. Good style and characterization were mentioned fre- quently, as well as distinguished style char- acterized by competent plotting and or- ganization of material, leading to good readability. These responses provide an interesting contrast to a study published in Elementary English in November, 1963. Editors of forty-six publishing houses responded to a questionnaire sent to them by George I. Brown (2). Brown found that editors use 63 different criteria in judging a manu- script, but two are used most often: 1) per- sonal opinion and reaction, and 2) mar- ketability. Some editors were upset by</page><page sequence="10">The Future of Children's Books 511 Brown's suggestion that manuscript con- sideration is not always a unified, studied, systematic procedure. However, Brown found, as did this study, that the editors were very sincere in their desire to publish the best manuscripts. This subjective con- clusion must be drawn from their constant references to "quality of writing" and "worthy content." According to the editors, most companies have publishing programs and whether they publish a given book depends on whether the book fits into that program. Beyond this, they look at originality and good design. Editors indicated that their houses restrict their publications to a few categories, thus making a great many good manuscripts unacceptable to them. One editor indicated that he asks whether the manuscript is better than anything now or soon likely to be available, as far as non- fiction is concerned. With fiction, he asks whether the material is original, artistic, good enough for children, and will children want to re read it. Surprisingly enough, an- other editor indicated that library stand- ards are one of his prime concerns. He asks himself, "Is this book needed?" In a more philosophical vein, another editor asks him- self whether the title will make a distinc- tive and worthwhile addition to the world of books. A fellow editor indicated that if he had published seventeen dog stories in one season he probably wouldn't publish another one no matter how good. In summary, it would appear that chil- dren's editors, like all other editors, are looking for new, fresh, well-written, salable material. These are general criteria which editors everywhere must use. Their feelings reinforce a thesis implicit in this paper, that children's books are a part of the main- stream of the world of books. Changes in Reading Habits The editors indicated very clearly that there is a discernible trend for adolescents to read adult books at an earlier age than formerly. The reasons advanced for this change include television and other media which are causing a greater awareness in young children and more curiosity about our world. Furthermore, children today re- sent being talked down to and find that in adult books this does not happen. The edi- tors feel that librarians are encouraging them to do so and that it is a wise move. They indicate that children are being en- couraged to read adult books, as they have always done in the past. The history of children's literature is replete with ex- amples of books which have been "appro- priated by children," to use Paul Hazard's phrase. Perhaps another important reason is that teenagers find that books written for them, as a rule, are rather routine. An editor pointed to the general speed-up in high school programs which will have the effect of raising levels in nonfiction as well as in fiction. "Perhaps children are trying to grow up faster and faster these days?" asked one perceptive editor. The opinion was offered that teenage novels are now read by junior high students, but senior high students have moved on to adult works, both fiction and nonfiction. This same editor also pointed to better teaching and the generally more sophisticated world in which we live as effects which make adolescents move out of juvenile literature much earlier than they did, even ten years ago. Children's Books of the Future The concluding question asked of the editors was this: "As a result of this opin- ionnaire, our intent is to discuss children's books of the future. In brief, what do you expect to happen in this field for which librarians, teachers, and parents should be aware of and prepared?" The answers ranged over a wide territory.</page><page sequence="11">512 Elementary English One publisher indicated that more titles would be published in the future, but that more discrimination on the part of the edi- tors will be needed. He felt, happily, that books will become more a part of growing up and readership will improve in quality and quantity. He sees the push on educa- tion spurring this because the country is becoming more mature and all of us will use our leisure time more profitably. Jean Karl, children's book editor for Atheneum, writing in Library Journal (9), feels that publishers must continue to pub- lish for wide needs: Because we do not know tomorrow, but must anticipate it, because we must cope with a divergence of information to be com- municated, and most of all because we can- not give children a narrow look at what interests them or what they have come to need; because we dare not pour children in- to tight molds, because we must encourage diversity, in authors and in minds of chil- dren, the avalanche [of books being pub- lished] must exist. The cost of publishing, as well it might be, was a concern of a great many editors. They felt that they must find a way to educate the buying market in what is best against what is cheap and trivial and then the public should expect to buy the best for their money. Similarly, with the in- creasing number of children's books being published annually, one editor cautioned that in the future purchases will have to be more selective than ever. The great rash of "easy readers" of low quality, not really balanced by a few books of truly excellent quality, makes the task of choosing chil- dren's books a very difficult one. There are vast numbers of mediocre books on the market. Several editors expressed the hope that children's books will become less expensive in the future, fewer in number, and of higher quality. They also indicated that perhaps in the future children's books will be better planned for the age group they are to reach. The great numbers of chil- dren's books which are being published make the job of recognizing new and orig- inal talent even more difficult. Some editors felt that it is imperative that they try not to sift their reactions to the output of crea- tive people through their adult experiences. They must constantly remember that chil- dren are brand new, even if they as adults are not. Again, Viguer's (13) very cogent re- marks must be referred to. Her views of the future are clear, and, most of all, op- timistic: The growing interest in poetry today bodes well for the future . . . much poetry for chil- dren will continue to be drawn from the work of the great poets. . . .
