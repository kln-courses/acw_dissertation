Lincoln Kirstein, 'Photography', unpaginated note, Photography Exhibition, Harvard Society of Contemporary Art, 1930, Walker Evans Archive. In the December 1933 issue of the Museum of Modern Art Bulletin, Lincoln Kirstein announced a small exhibition of thirty-nine photographs of Victorian architecture by Walker Evans that he had assembled in the museum's Architecture room. He provided a pithy analysis of the work and a meditation on the medium itself: Photography is in essence a scientifically accurate process for the reproduction of objective appearances, a stationary magic that fixes a second from time's passage on a single plane. Its greatest service is documentary. Walker Evans's photographs are such perfect documents that their excellence is not assertive. In his series of American Federal and Victorian architecture ... he is providing illustrations for a monumental history of the American art of building in its most imaginative and impermanent state. These wooden houses disintegrate, almost, between snaps of the lens. Many shown in these photographs no longer stand.2 It was as if Evans captured these buildings at the point of collapse, and fixed them forever on the surface of the print. If the vulnerability of these houses predicated their photographic preservation, then Evans's documents contributed to a de facto archive of vernacular architecture. In this regard, the photographs had a blunt evidential function - Evans was literally recording the buildings for posterity. Yet it was precisely this mode of photography that generated the 'stationary magic'. For Kirstein, Evans's stark, unyielding focus presented these scenes exactly, but this deadpan vision paradoxically maximised the 'airless atmosphere', provoking interest in the obscure and ephemeral quality of the buildings as much as their construction. Charged with ineffable and arbitrary meanings, they superseded the task of mute documentation. Kirstein had first noted the conjunction in photography of a 'scientifically accurate process' with this 'stationary magic' to form an expressive document in a note to accompany his 1930 Photography Exhibition at the Harvard Society of Contemporary Arts, which incidentally marked the first public display of Evans's work. He wrote: Photography exists in the contemporary consciousness of time, surprising the passing moment out of its context in flux, and holding it up to be regarded in the magic of its arrest. It has the curious vividness and unreality of street accidents, things seen from a passing train, and personal situations overheard or seen by choice- as one looks from a window of one skyscraper into the lighted room of another forty stories high and only across the street.3 In the 1933 article, Kirstein 's model of an emergent Evans idiom encapsulated these specific qualities of the medium. Moreover, the Victorian architecture photographs exhibition can be seen as a precursor to the more famous Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) American Photographs exhibition and photo-book of 1938, and as the moment when Evans's aesthetic was first © The Author 2010.

Kir stein memorably summarised Evans's idiom with an opaque yet apt characterisation of the 'tender cruelty of Evans's camera', constructing an enduring myth of a roving unseen poet of the camera who sifts through the myriad spectacles of contemporary life to expose glimmering beguiling nuggets of bittersweet reality by scrutinising them in unsentimental close-ups and crops. The core of Evans's idiom had primary symbiotic elements - unexplored in Kir stein 's curt yet acute commentaries - that can be classified as 'the archive' and 'the uncanny' . This small exhibition of 1933 was an important, yet embryonic, moment in the development of an Evans typology that was concretised in American Photographs, and thus lacked the coherent presentation of the latter show. Certainly, some confusion resided in Kirstein's conception of the exhibition - was it an exposition of the architecture or a portfolio of art photographs, and thus was it a celebration of Kirstein's curatorial endeavour or Evans's pictorial innovation? The question of the authorship of the display, and by extension the photographs, is therefore pertinent. Evans was cited as the author at the exhibition and Kirstein as the humble curator, but the photographs were actually commissioned for tentative projects that were conceived by Kirstein and his friend Jack Wheelwright. At this stage, Kirstein was the editor of the modernist forum Hound and Horn and was the lynchpin of the Harvard Society of Contemporary Art - for which he and Wheelwright planned to hold a survey exhibition of Victorian architecture. Wheelwright, a fellow Harvard aesthete, aimed to produce a book on New England and New York State buildings dating from the Civil War to the turn of the century. The book was never completed and the exhibition never transpired. Indeed, the sole legacy of the project was Evans's extensive photographic work, which was pared down to a cogent series for the MoMA show. In the spring of 1931 Evans and Kirstein, accompanied later by Wheelwright, spent several weeks touring New England and New York towns hunting down architectural relics (a majority of the photographs were taken in the suburbs and satellites of Boston). Kirstein and Wheelwright financed and scheduled the project, chose the locations, and Evans then photographed the buildings. This junior status rankled and Kirstein recalled Evans's perpetual grumbling about his status as 'only a paid photographer'. Yet while Kirstein and Wheelwright conceived the project right down to the selection of the buildings, then Evans would typically make the final decision whether or not to photograph them, causing much friction by insisting on working only in brilliant sunlight with limited shadows from trees or other buildings. Jigsaw House at Ocean City, New Jersey exemplifies this technique well. Evans photographed the facade of this ornately gabled villa head on with a razor- sharp focus complemented by the overt brightness of the lighting conditions (Fig. 1). Evans would insist on revisiting the sites if the light was too weak, and Kirstein justifiably noted that 'it is a painfully haphazard method limited by time, money, and insufficient information'. In subsequent published accounts, Kirstein sacrificed the albeit uneasy maverick documentary auteur. As Evans grew older, he was happily complicit in this formulation, as Allan Sekula puts it, distinguishing 'the art photographer from a flunky in a hierarchy of flunkies' - in other words, the difference between being an artist rather than just a hired hand. It was at this and the later MoMA exhibition that the artist-photographer model itself was reconstituted. 192 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 4.

Wheelwright and Kirstein were somewhat influenced by their fellow Harvard alumnus Henry-Russell Hitchcock who was currently collaborating with the photographer Berenice Abbott on a detailed record of pre Civil War American architecture, perhaps seeing their own project as a sequel. Abbott and Hitchcock's studies resulted in the 1934 Yale University exhibition Photographs for Henry-Russell Hitchcock's Urban Vernacular of the Forties, Fifties, and Sixties, and in Hitchcock's The Architecture of H.H.

Yet in his formulations, Kirstein avoided situating the photographs as documents of real places that informed the viewer about the sociality of the depicted scene. If the photographs were neither straightforward documents of a vernacular architectural style nor a revelatory exposé of the social make-up of a locale, then these apparently expressive documents were arguably self-reflexive. Kirstein framed Evans's documentary idiom as a type of Modernist formalism, but then his aesthetic position typified the abnegation of the social contingency of cultural forms in a nascent MoMA ideology, a position shared with Alfred H. Barr Jr, Henry- Russell Hitchcock, Philip Johnson, and eventually Beaumont Newhall in the Photography Department. In this case, formalism functioned by slicing these buildings from their environment and splicing them together into a new context, in which formal relations were fundamental and other associations were neutralised. In this case, formalism functioned by slicing these buildings from their environment and splicing them together into a new context, in which formal relations were fundamental and other associations were neutralized. This editorial configuration bordered on a closed- circuit assemblage - rather than constructing new ideas in the reconfiguration from one reality to another via the dialectical movement of montage, the photographs might only refer to one another in a continuum of reification. However Evans's idiom offered resistance in abstract terms through formal analogies that used an archival mode to generate uncanny disturbances that ruptured the ideological formalism of MoMA. Therefore I argue that Evans's practice, which sought out stresses and fissures in the social, could not be held within this formalist loop - the Victorian houses indicated an architectural mindscape and functioned as both métonymie and synecdochic portraits of a damaged nation. Frederic Jameson has remarked how an individual building can be a site of Utopian values, and describes this OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 193</page><page sequence="4">Barnaby Harán relationship to a total ideal environment in terms of 'that monumental part that cannot be whole and yet attempts to express it' . In this article, however, I am more concerned with an anti-utopian, potentially dystopian, sensibility. First, I will consider the issue of the archive. Recently, Wolfgang Brückle has usefully dubbed Evans's approach in the 1930s as an 'archival practice', similar to Berenice Abbott's decade-long Changing New York project and August Sander's extensive portraits of social typologies in Germany. This observation is derived from Sekula who terms Evans's engagement in the 1930s with archival photography as 'the most complicated and intellectually sophisticated response to the model of the archive'. Unlike the nominally scientific business of making archives, this archival mode of photography belonged, despite the sociological affectations, ultimately to the artistic sphere and was more intuitive than appearances suggest. Brückle imagines how, in collating their photographs for books, 'Sander and Evans both stood like readers of unknown information in front of the material they themselves had collected'. Produced for gallery exhibitions, books, magazine stories, advertisements, and the photography market, this archival practice necessarily differed from processes of making images for actual archives - an exception was arguably the Resettlement Administration /Farm Security Administration archive that was, in any case, outside Evans's jurisdiction and involved the collation of genre photographs. Evans and Sander embraced the manner of archival photographs for their seeming disjuncture from traditions of art photography, and significantly, both drew from the non- scientific documentary mode of Eugène Atget, which was developed outside the auspices of 'art photography'. Atget ignored conventions of artistic authorship by aligning his work with the humble artisanal practice of producing photographs for others' uses (from architectural firms to libraries) to the extent of refusing picture credits - in response to such a request, the Surrealists were told 'don't put my name on it. These are simply documents that I make'. As Molly Nesbit writes, Atget 's project involved the generation of functional photographic documents that fell, according to the nineteenth century 'art versus science' debate on photography, outside of the normative mechanisms of artistic invention and belonged to the great welter of informational images, the piles of 'optical dust' that lay below the lowest genres in visual hierarchies. These blank documents were filled with meaning and value through instrumental application. Yet, while mutable, the documents were hardly mute but were over-abundant with information - the documentary function was stretched to capacity and invited aesthetic consideration, but despite this excess of data the work remained an archival rather than art phenomenon. In his photography, Evans sought out this curious interstitial space occupied by the excessive document, but with a greater investment in the institutional structures of the aesthetic realm - put simply, his photographs were more obviously art objects than documents. In his later years, Evans himself distinguished his work from 'literal documents' when he made this famous pronouncement about the term 'documentary': That's a very sophisticated and misleading word. And not really clear. You have to have a sophisticated ear to receive that word. The term should be "documentary style". An example of a literal document would be a police photograph of a murder scene. You see, a document has use, whereas art is really useless. Therefore art is never a document, though it certainly can adopt that style.14 194 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 9.

One could equally use the term 'archival style'. Robin Kelsey writes that 'because archives have operated under expectations of self-effacement, however, they have had to boost themselves indirectly through the records they amass and organise. This and other circumstantial demands for indirectness have historically fostered the rise of archive styles'.

Notably, Evans eschewed any implications of ameliorative potentiality or instrumental value in the term but located aesthetic interest in the photographic technique. 'Documentary style' photography was effectively a rhetorical gambit, consisting of superficially bland and banal frontal orthogonal portraits of people and objects that drew consciously or not from the language of archival photographs and was largely opposed both to the florid ruminations of Pictorialism and to the vaulting angularity of the so-called Cubist photography. In this discussion, I will favour the 'archival mode' as a descriptive tool over Evans's over-determined 'documentary style', which has the misleading connotation of a humanist polemic that irons out the contradictions in his photography. Evans's archival mode signalled a break with the predominant form and content of 1920s American photography, namely the geometric machine aesthetic abstractions of Paul Strand, Charles Sheeler, Imogen Cunningham, Ralph Steiner, Edward Weston, and his own early forays. This body of work was the American wing of an international fashion for variegated photographic perspectives that stretched from novelty advertising to the revolutionary practices of Soviet radical formalism. If Evans sought to distance himself from the commercial trickery of 1920s American photography, then he was nonetheless impressed by the New Vision, as is evident in his response to the work selected by László Moholy-Nagy for the 1929 Film und Foto exhibition at Stuttgart. In his 1931 review of photo -books for Kir stein's Hound and Horn, Evans applauded Franz Roh's Photo-Auge, the publication that accompanied the exhibition, and revealed his excitement at the myriad uses of photography: Photo-Eye is a nervous and important book. Its editors call the world not only beautiful but exciting, cruel, and weird. In intention social and didactic, this is an anthology of the 'new' photography; yet its editors knew where to look for their material, and print examples of the news photo, aerial photography, microphotography, astronomical photography, photomontage and the photogram, multiple exposure and the negative print.16 Like many American photographers, in his own practice, he largely forsook the great range of experiments of the so-called modernist photography on display at Film und Foto, and at Kirstein's American facsimile of the exhibition, the 1930 Photography Exhibition, preferring to remain within the remit of straight photography. Rather, he sacrificed the multifarious possibilities of the New Vision and abandoned the ubiquitous skyscraper verticality of its American counterpart, but used its expansive reach beyond the traditions of art photography as a means of legitimising his stylistic emulation of archival photography. Unlike the hyperactive explorative camera eye of New Vision photography, archival photographs function most effectively through regularity and consistency. While not totally uniform, Evans's photographs of Victorian architecture were essentially regular in their construction. They featured either rows of houses, individual buildings, or occasionally close-ups of facets of buildings. Rows of buildings in a street were photographed when a single model was repeated, whether in terraces or housing estates (Fig. 2). The scenes were depopulated and largely free of other objects - street scenes were notably devoid of cars. The compositions were almost entirely orthogonal, featuring a single house or a group of houses, from head-on, or from a 45° angle. Often the photographs were taken from directly across the street, and very rarely from inside the grounds (some owners complained to OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 195</page><page sequence="6">Barnaby Harán Flg. 2.

Lighting was typically strong, accompanied by a sharp focus that highlighted architectural details. The thematic unity of these photographs, evident in Evans's insistence on regular viewpoints, depopulated scenes, and brilliant light, suggests a standardised approach that borrowed from archival photography and indicates, rather than constitutes, a potential archive on Victorian architecture. In the 1980s, Sekula and John Tagg investigated the photographs from numerous archives and, drawing from Michel Foucault's theories of the complex negotiations of knowledge and power, noted the primacy of the medium as a tool in processes of classification and the subsequent impact on social relations, especially where photography has been used to create purportedly factual documents that naturalise and legitimise the existing hierarchies and present them as eternally valid. The thousands of images that can be classified as archival photography, produced largely from the 1870s onwards, were coded according to a language of realism that manipulated the rhetorically persuasive 'reality effect' of photographs by diminishing the authorial presence and emphasising unmediated reflection through homogenous lighting, angle, distance from subject, tonal range, and framing. This establishes the interconnections between the photographs, and their mutual existence as units of a totality. As Sekula notes, an 'abstract visual equivalence between pictures' generates this truth effect through standardised techniques. The specific attributes of a 'scientific' style - such as subdued lighting, even tones, and orthogonal composition - state a mode of truthful reflection, which marks deviation from objectivity as a decline into subjectivity and therefore inaccuracy. Conversely, this visual language was a means of stressing aberrations - the elemental unseen photographic eye centred normality on the archival process and its subjects were measured accordingly through degrees of difference. The effect is established through 196 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 17. The photographs were also part of the general practice of contemporary architectural photography, which required decent lighting and treated people as a distraction to architectural designs. Evans himself was occasionally hired to produce such photographs, although in this case the images are rarely considered as part of the canon. Ironically, this is because they are too much documents and insufficiently Evansesque.

Nesbit, p. 17. the regular orthogonal viewpoint that reproduces the normative conventions of post- Renaissance perspectivai spatial ordering and stresses objectivity while simultaneously rendering the archival eye invisible but also omniscient and therefore equivalent to vision. Archival photographs do not present the object as a representation or even a trace but the thing itself, and any juxtapositions of photographs - be it the eyes and ears of the criminal, skull sizes of asylum inmates, or even racial types - are actually presented as assemblages of actual objects. Even benign archives enact the logic of the unseen all -seeing eye of truth, although technical variation, thematic range, and fluctuating degrees of instrumental function obviously occur. Sekula argues that specific archives cohere in their divergent operations according to 'the archive', a sort of 'meta- archive' that governs power relations through knowledge production: 'clearly archives are not neutral; they embody the power inherent in accumulation, collection, and hoarding as well as that power inherent in the command of the lexicon and rules of a language' . This principle is indebted to Foucault who argued that the archive was an analogue of social regulation that far exceeded the scope of actual archives and related to the base of knowledge itself: the archive is the first law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events. But the archive is also that which determines that all these things said do not accumulate endlessly in an amorphous mass, nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity, nor do they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents; but they are grouped together in distinct figures, composed together in accordance with multiple relations, maintained or blurred in accordance with specific regularities.21 The archive was therefore a technique of a truth regime. For Jacques Derrida the archive also equated the basis of knowledge as power: 'there is no political power without the control of the archive, if not of memory. Effective democratization can always be measured by this essential criterion: the participation in and the access to the archive, its constitution, and its interpretation'. Derrida 's etymological analysis of the word located the matrix of knowledge and power in the Greek 'archon' that denoted 'guardians of power' , but pointedly this power related to the position of the citizen in terms of public space: It is thus, in this domiciliation, in this house arrest, that archives take place. The dwelling, this place where they dwell permanently, marks this institutional passage from the private to the public, which does not always mean from the secret to the nonsecret ... the documents, which are not always discursive writings, are only kept and classified under the title of a privileged topology.23 In Foucault and Derrida, therefore, the construct of the archive as the basis of law - the intrinsic logic of social ordering - refers partly to actual archives but chiefly to a sort of meta-archive, a supra-legal, and ideological formation. In Derrida specifically, the archive functioned as a device of social regulation with specific reference to architectural space - in the law's negation of the illusory division of private and public space, both seen and unseen, the home itself became a site of 'archontic power'. Nesbit cautions against a generalised notion of 'the archive' as an explanatory device on the basis that it might negate the variations between specific archives - she writes that 'a general idea of the archive, like the general idea of the document, deflects us from the qualitative differences between specific archives'. Yet, the standardised photographic methods used in producing OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 197</page><page sequence="8">Barnaby Harán the documents of these actual archives can be amalgamated so that the commonalities beneath the specific attributes of each archive combine into an archival mode, a general technique that equates a meta-archive through reference to a generic photographic document, based on a conjunction of archival veracity and photographic accuracy. Evans's photographs of Victorian architecture reproduced this quality of the archival mode but do not as such belong to a specific archive. Rather they suggested an archive, but resided ultimately in the reconstituted genus of art photography, an emergent canonical order that was epitomised by the all encompassing New Vision and the Film und Foto exhibition, and was contingent on an equation of photographic seeing and the logic of objectivity as a corrective to the subjective indeterminacy of earlier art photography. Like the New Vision, Evans's secondary archival mode appropriated the aesthetics of scientific photography for extraneous purposes. Ultimately, archival effects are reproduced, but without the actuality of a specific archive and the contingency of purposeful practice the invoked document is really a facsimile of documents per se in a generic archival mode. Yet, the relocation of this photographic technique to the American scene was a crucial factor. I argue that Evans's photography witnessed a productive equation of the archival mode with the abstract archive in terms of a confrontation with a pervasive version of Americanism. Evans's application of the archival mode held a critical element in which the standardisation of vision was the most potent means of engaging with broader social regulation. In other words, I suggest that the photographs position America itself as equivalent to an archive. In the 1920s, America represented the technological, industrial, and financial vanguard and so was often seen as an analogue of modernity. Yet, while elements of the European and Soviet intelligentsia heralded Fordism and Taylorism, evident in the cults of Amerikanismus and Amerikanizm, as the means of modernising Europe's antiquated societies, or in the latter case constructing socialism from the ashes of Tsarism, war, and revolution, many American intellectuals and artists abhorred the homogenised, standardised nature of American life. Peter Neagoe wrote that American expatriates in Europe (as Evans was from 1926 to 1927) had fled the tyranny of 'standardization' - 'a foe subtler than old age and the middle class, but no less oppressive and insidious'. Evans was party to this romantic anti- capitalism as is evident in an untitled poem from 1929/1930 about a dislocated and alienating but fundamentally standardised metropolis, albeit with an ironic tinge: one part of the city impaled punctured cubes full of stenographers desires banalities not good enough for their shell.27 An appended note underlines the sense of amused fascination bordering on repulsion: 'to hell with the filthy cubes of the city - architecturally speaking. Fourteen thousand two hundred and seventy three tragedies, 67284 mysteries, several obscure dramas with or without poetry there in the night'. Evans's primary personal response to standardisation was a revolt against the gluttonous worship of money that saturated American society. Pertinently, his abandonment of the ubiquitous skyscraper imagery for archaic architecture and street photography began in 1929, just as the Wall Street Crash catalysed 198 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 26.

In the American imagining, the crystalline towers of Coolidge's boom years were replaced by the ramshackle shanty Hoover villes of the enveloping Depression. Skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building were denounced as 'bull market architecture' because 'they soar boldly above a surrounding mesa of roofs . . . they hover over the flat plateau of stability, the ironic witnesses of collapsed hopes'. It was pertinent therefore that skyscrapers were only evident in Evans's occasional commercial or commissioned photography. Evans was by no means alone in enacting this aesthetic turn in photography. Paul Strand's series of photographs of New Mexico and Colorado ghost towns also engaged with the jaded iconography of ruination and the archaic. More importantly, Ralph Steiner, who had been the leading photographer of skyscrapers, had photographed Victorian architecture with ironic bite from 1929 but was also an unofficial mentor to Evans. Steiner lent Evans a large format view camera for the project, which created 18 X 24 cm negatives, providing much greater detail than his customary Leica. Strand and Steiner 's images of Victorian architecture shared a fascination with the arcane and obscure America in the shadows of the Machine Age, but neither invoked the standardisation of American life nor emulated archival modes. Ironically, if Strand and Steiner belonged to an older generation of photographers, then these two were politically radicalised during the depression while Evans enacted a more generic revolt against American values. His increasingly bilious disgust for the glossy surfaces of the Jazz decade was targeted at Edward Steichen's commercial photography, which was a 'reflection of the Chrysler period'.32 Steichen's work represented: 'money, understanding of advertising, special feeling for parvenu elegance, slick technique, over all which is thrown a hardness and superficiality that is the hardness and superficiality of America's latter day, and has nothing to do with any person'.33 If the Chrysler period was helmed by the consummate businessman's president, then Evans delighted in repeatedly hurling an ice pick at a portrait of Coolidge that he had affixed to his kitchen door. In 1971, he recalled his distaste for America, accentuated by working night shifts on Wall Street: 'I was really anti-American at the time. America was big business and I wanted to escape. It nauseated me. My photography was a semi-conscious reaction against right-thinking and optimism; it was an attack on the establishment'.34 Yet he acknowledged that it had been a 'branch of épater le bourgeois', and belonged to an older tradition of somewhat ineffectual, vaguely anarchistic bohemian rebellion against a generalised nexus of government, religion, and morality. As he put it, 'we had barnacles of Victorianism hanging around that wouldn't scrape off. If this all sounds like retrospective romanticism, then at the time Evans wrote brilliantly to his German friend, the socialist painter Hans Skolle: 'America is really changing, though I don't think you'd like it any better. At least, though, none of the cocksure prosperous ones are cocksure now'. If his Victorian architecture photographs registered these disturbances in contemporary America, then Evans's engagement was made equally of fascination and revulsion (a balance absent in his later retrospective 'anti- Americanism', which given the early 1970s context appears opportunistic). Although seemingly anti- capitalist, he appeared sceptical of any radical forces that sought to transform America into a communist society. Despite his general reputation as a compassionate leftist, Evans was only loosely connected to the revolutionary organisations that intended to OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 199</page><page sequence="10">Barnaby Harán harness photography as a social weapon. He avoided the militant outrage of the Workers Film and Photo League (WFPL) photographers such as Leo Seltzer. For Seltzer, documentary photography and film were means of countering official news by demonstrating the activist viewpoint. The WFPL focused on the dispossessed, largely recording strikes, social unrest, and police brutality in the most radical manifestation of social documentary to date. Evans orbited the group but kept a distance, as a letter to WFPL member Jay Ley da reveals: 'I got angry with them because they used my name as sponsor after I had declined the honor with reasons. Very foolish of them to antagonize that way'. Other engagements with organised leftist politics were random and tangential. In 1933, Evans and Ley da together photographed Diego Rivera's Portrait of America mural cycle for the New Workers' School, which was set up by the Communist Party Opposition, the group that was formed by the Trotskyite Jay Lovestone after his expulsion from the CPUSA. If it seems fitting that the perennial refusenik Evans mucked in with the Left opposition, then it should be remembered that his motives were chiefly financial, although he personally admired the work of Rivera, himself an expellee of the Mexican Communist Party. However, it is telling that his most direct photographic encounter with the Communist Party witnessed a distinct lack of glorification. His 1934 photographic series for Fortune of a CPUSA picnic could hardly be termed Proletarianism, being more akin to the accompanying journalist, and actually ardent leftist, D wight Macdonald's private feelings concerning a 'squirming mass . . . [that] . . . came near to making a fascist out of me'. In Evans's photos, the perspiring communists are depicted as overcome by intense heat, an oily throng wallowing under the sweltering sun, yet have a humanity lacking in Macdonald's comments. They are nonetheless rendered different and distant, and their otherness makes them appear like the typological specimens of Sander's studies, and far from the worker idolatry of the Third Period. Evans's politics were therefore diffuse but typically cynical. With mirthful derision, he sounded off in a letter of 1930 on H. G. Wells, whom he termed 'not a poet, not an artist, not an historian. Just a goddam little socialist', before concluding gleefully 'me, I am a Fascisti and I think the human race should be kicked around a great deal more than it is, and that I should do the kicking'. Yet despite the complexity of Evans's angry yet comic malaise with corporate America and his inconsistent yet apparent leftism, his photography was compact and direct in coolly confronting American standardisation with its own logic through the archival mode, as evident in the banality of the photographs of Victorian architecture, the emphasis on seriality, and the taxonomic approach. He actually articulated this position most effectively in a laudatory review of Sander's Antlitz der Zeit - 'a case of the camera looking in the right direction among people. This is one of the futures of photography foretold by Atget. It is a photographic editing of society, a clinical process; even enough of a cultural necessity to make one wonder why other so-called advanced countries of the world have not also been examined and recorded'.43 Sander's typological studies of German social groups effectively archived contemporary Germany, assembling individuals through a largely standardised technique - in terms of lighting, camera distance from sitter etc. - that played on the tension between their uniqueness and their status as types.44 Also writing in 1931, Walter Benjamin described the work as 'a training manual' for dangerous times ahead, as a way of knowing who's who in a society typified by 'sudden shifts of power'. Clearly invoking 200 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 38. The Workers Film and Photo League was formed in late 1930. It was sponsored by the Internationale Arbeiterhilfe (Workers' International Relief), a Communist organisation that was itself part of the Comintern. The WFPL was essentially a combination of the Japanese Workers' Camera Club with a group of film writers and filmmakers. It was founded to instruct unemployed workers in photographic techniques so that photography would be a weapon against injustice. In their photographs, aesthetic niceties were necessarily sacrificed for an emotive and attention-grabbing activist approach. Many of the surviving photographs were taken by Leo Seltzer, who captured mass demonstrations and brutal police responses from the perspective of the worker in the middle of the crowd, unlike the press photographers who generally observed events from behind police lines. The nucleus of the WFPL consisted of Tom Brandon, Sam Brody, Harry Alan Potamkin, Seltzer, Ralph Steiner, Lester Balog, and Robert Del Duca. Their films were inspired by Dziga Vertov's Kino Pravda outfit and included Bonus March of 1932, and the America Today series of 1932-1934. Strand joined the group just as it was splitting apart in 1934 into the Film and Photo League, with Seltzer, Balog, and Del Duca, and the film group Nykino, led by Steiner and Leo Hurwitz. Steiner and Strand participated as filmmakers rather than photographers. 39. Walker Evans to Jay Leyda, 22 November 1933, Jay Leyda Papers, Box 3 Folder 33, Tamiment Library, New York University. 40.

Atget was well known in the USA mostly through the efforts of Berenice Abbott, who lived in Paris from 1922 to 1929 and worked as Man Ray's assistant. She was acquainted with Atget and photographed him at her studio. Following his death in 1927, she persuaded Julien Levy to purchase half of the surviving glass negatives, which were subsequently shipped to New York. Levy commissioned Erhard Weyhe to produce a book, Atget: Photographe de Paris, and to host an exhibition at Weyhe 's bookstore in 1930. Evans met Abbott around 1929 and she showed him her prints of Atget 's negatives at her Horatio Street studio. He later claimed to have been unaware of Atget during his formative years - 'I didn't know [Atget 's work] at all for a while' - and was keen to diminish any influence. Katz, 'An Interview with Walker Evans', p. 362. 49. Evans, The Re-appearance of Photography, p. 126. anthropological and sociological archival modes, Sander's studies disrupted normative conventions of portraiture by presenting subjects as units of multiples, a method that Evans applied in numerous photographs. Evans and Sander's simulations of archival modes purposefully superseded the task of archival documentation. Both photographers aped the archival eye in assuming degrees of invisibility in their work, although Evans typically played on the tension between the seen and unseen photographer. Ian Walker discusses similar qualities in Surrealist photography and quotes André Breton's argument that automatic writing was 'the veritable photography of thought' and his celebration of the camera as a 'blind instrument' .^ Evans's early experiments in covert street photography, sometimes using right-angle lenses, led ultimately to the fabled subway portraits, where the predatorial camera lens protruded from his overcoat, witnessing the phallus of surveillance both reiterated and appropriated. His Victorian architecture photographs were closer, however, to Sander's more consistently deadpan application of the camera as a mechanistic post-human archival eye. The archival mode was further evident in these images through Evans's emphasis on the multiple. He isolated each building, but gave focus to facets in which the repetitive architectural motifs were most emphatic. When the photographs were presented together, the seriality was amplified and the images became fragments of an open pattern, or units in a meta-archive. This aspect of the multiple chimed with the uncanny effect of Evans's use of lighting. The intense illumination provided a superabundance of information that exceeded the brief to record the buildings by flooding them with distorted, curious shadows. In Wooden Gothic Revival House, the camera blandly faces a cottage whose outsized gothic porch has deep and dark hooded eyes, framed by the polite fringe of the ornate eaves. The 'For Sale' sign functions almost as a punch line (Fig. 3). In these photographs, the blunt framing mixed with intense lighting emphasises the absurdity of the homespun architectural mode of these empty homes, signifying divergence from archival photography proper. Also, the depopulated nature of these scenes and the silence of the buildings enhance the uncanniness of the interplay between an empty house and the dark chamber of the camera. The games of blind vision, distortion, and the multiple coalesce in this peculiar self-referentiality. Graig Owens has discussed 'reduplication' in Evans's photographs, where objects arranged with 'radical symmetry', mimic the photographic process, and 'impute to the material world the capacity to independently create its own symmetries, to mirror itself. In a photograph of the interior of a hotel in Saratoga Springs (a rare interior and thus atypical in the series), Evans showed a long corridor with numerous identical windows reflected in a double antique mirror - its long-receding line of recesses gives the effect of looking down the extended bellows of the view camera itself towards an identical set of mirrors. If the uncanny was palpable in Evans's photography, then this was a reflection of his admiration for Atget 's work. For Evans, Atget was the key precursor to both Sander's work and his own practice. Seeing this vast corpus as a template for contemporary photography, Evans celebrated Atget 's 'lyrical understanding of the street, trained observation of it, special feeling for patina, eye for revealing detail' and emulated the unsentimental yet poetic focus on the obscure within the everyday. If Evans equated his own developing idiom with Sander's as a parallel response to Atget, then these photographers shared an interest in the banality of everyday life as a site of intense strangeness, the oft- cited extraordinary within the ordinary.

The eeriness of Atget's photographs of Paris, a city without citizens, was acutely diagnosed by Benjamin, who wrote that 'he photographed them like scenes of crime. The scene of a crime, too, is deserted; it is photographed for the purpose of establishing evidence. With Atget, photographs become standard evidence for historical occurrences, and acquire a hidden political significance'. Crucially, Sekula cites Evans's interest in police photography in detailing his archival mode in specific relation to his aforementioned subway photographs of the late 1930s: one of Evans's notes on the series stated 'this project get police cards'.51 Originally entitled The Passengers but eventually compiled in the 1960s as Many are Called, these covert, candid portraits of nameless citizens, recorded anonymously, strike associations of both mugshots and surveillance photographs. Noting the matrix of photographer, detective, and flâneur, fixed on the collation of spectacular documents, Sekula quotes Benjamin: 'no matter what trail the ßaneur may follow, every one will lead him to a crime'.

In Atget and Evans's photography, the opposite was apparent in as much as the crime scene had no crime and no criminal, just an insinuation that these empty spaces have been actively voided of life. The silence of the photographic image is deliberately doubled in the over- stated absences of the scene. The latent malevolence in Atget 's photographs, manifested in the disquieting sense of a possible but unknowable crime, also intrigued Breton, Louis Aragon, and the coterie of Surrealist photographers. Indeed, Evans noted slyly that 'in some of his work [Atget] even places himself to be pounced upon by the most orthodox of surréalistes'. However, while Evans's view of Atget 's Surrealist admirers was dismissive - he included Surrealism in a 1937 list of dislikes - then he ignored the similarity of his work to Surrealist straight photographs by Eli Lotar, Boiffard, and Brassai, particularly in the mutual evocation of the creeping menace of Atget 's urban vistas, such as his photograph of Rue Laplace and Rue Valette, Paris where in a simple image of a junction of empty streets with puddles there lurks the possibility of a murder past or future (Fig. 4).55 In Atget, Surrealism, and Evans's photography, the surface of reality seems strained by unconscious forces in the contemporary world that have been transposed onto the negative as curious indices, as if beyond the control of the photographer. Walker writes that the uncanny resides in both the invisibility of the photographer and the indexicality of the photograph, as 'indexicality not only underlies our sense of photography's realism; it is also responsible for our sense that we are seeing an uncanny process at work - an image that has "made itself", the transmutation of a thing directly into its image, an image that in some way transcends the thing'. The index also binds the photograph to its material location, and its place of production is more emphatic in straight photography than in manipulated images where it is tampered with or masked by distorted or multiple points of origin. For Walker, Surrealist straight photography provided the most potent index of the mysterious prosaic marvels of the always-vanishing pockets of Parisian streets and alleyways with doorways that hint at catacomb corridors. In Evans's photographs of Victorian architecture, the subject was almost entirely the domestic scene - these were homes, although shorn of signs of habitation, especially in the aforementioned Wooden Gothic Revival House, where the 'For Sale' sign draws attention to its potential vacancy. In Gothic Revival House with Three Gables, Nyack, New York, the slightly oblique perspective and superabundant lighting enhance the strangeness of the building, with its three severe triangles of the roof echoed by large shadows on the walls, adding an element of geometric abstraction to this archaic edifice that is almost a folly (Fig. 5). The absurdity of the gothic aspiration is redolent of a haunted house film set, defined by a comical spookiness underscored with a sense of the ephemeral via the paper-thin materiality of the perforated ornamentation. In this image, there is a tension between the house as a home and its absent occupants based on the conjunction of the vacancy of the building with the open windows - it is both a home and an empty building, simultaneously inhabited and unoccupied. In these photographs, houses can never fully operate as homes because, at least from the evidence presented, the occupants are always missing. These buildings could be abandoned and the inhabitants homeless or even murdered. Through OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 203</page><page sequence="14">Barnaby Harán Flg. 4.

Once again, this uncertain vacancy has the potential to mark a crime scene or a traumatic instance. The uncanny quality of the photographs is concentrated on the home itself, as these are literally 'unheimlich' houses. As Anthony Vidler relays, Freud seized upon the metaphor of home in 'unheimlich' in developing a trope to describe the points where the unconscious ominously seeped into the everyday, drawing immediately from a 1 906 essay by Ernst Jentsch that discussed neurosis in terms of the 'not at home' patient. However, Freud's more developed conception of 'unheimlich' created a functional antithesis to the term 'heimlich', by positioning the home as the foremost site of security and family - 'arousing a sense of agreeable restfulness and security as in one within the four walls of his house' - that operated as a symbol of both the womb and female genitalia, in relation to the interior and exterior. The home itself was thus both the locus and sign of the repression of traumas. In all its many 204 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 57.

In demarcating an 'architectural uncanny', Vidler traces cultural representations of the uncanny homes, in particular abandoned or apparently haunted houses, evident in Edgar Allen Poe's stories and in particular in Victor Hugo's drawings of and ruminations on a boarded up cottage in Jersey. In these sources, houses are anthropomorphic, with facades like menacing faces where windows seem like the empty eye sockets of automata. Vidler writes: as a concept, then, the uncanny has, not unnaturally, found its metaphorical home in architecture: first in the house, haunted or not, that pretends to afford the utmost security while opening itself to the secret intrusion of terror, and then in the city, where what was walled and intimate, the confirmation of community-one thinks of Rousseau's Geneva- has been rendered strange by spatial incursions of modernity.59 Evans's Victorian houses were ciphers of such transience, silent glimpsed reminders of the vanishing world in the wake of the skyscrapers that now towered like anachronistic totems of greed in the unravelling Machine Age. The photographs presented the buildings as strange echoes of the past that in their own creeping decline exposed the diminished power of American progress, rather than reminders of stolid American tenacity eternally resisting strife foursquare. The buildings were delicate relics, and Kirstein pointedly noted that 'many shown in these photographs no longer stand'.60 His comments echo an article in the magazine Fortune on the theme of 'Vanishing Backyards', which, in an otherwise anodyne text, described photographs by Steiner as 'a record of things which are passing'.61 In other words, the focus on the archaic was predicated on the imminence of its disappearance. OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 20S</page><page sequence="16">Barnaby Harán Benjamin observed this quality particularly in Surrealist practice: * [Breton] can boast an extraordinary discovery. He was the first to perceive the revolutionary energies that appear in the "outmoded", in the first iron constructions, the first factory buildings, the earliest photos, the objects that have begun to be extinct, grand pianos, the dresses of five years ago, and fashionable restaurants when the vogue has begun to ebb from them'. In seeking the marvellous in the everyday, Surrealism located disturbances in contemporary society in the residues of the past that were always vanishing from the present, a process of profound temporal disruption. In another sense, Ernst Bloch wrote of the 'non-simultaneity' of modernity as a pressure point: 'various years beat in the one which is just being counted and prevails. Nor do they flourish in obscurity as in the past, but contradict the Now; very strangely, crookedly, from behind'. Bloch 's conception of multiple coeval yet disjunctive forms of temporal consciousness was a tool for understanding the rise of Fascism in Germany, and the persistence of strands of petit-bourgeois anti-Modernism that were entangled in industrial modernity. Both Benjamin and Bloch identified the site of conflict in the wake rather than prow of modernity. In Atget, Surrealism, and Evans, the fascination with the lingering detritus discarded in the processes of historical change was manifested in banal almost invisible obscurities in everyday life. It is useful to consider the Victorian architecture photographs in relation to a nineteenth- century project, which Evans was unaware of, that has been discussed recently by Robin Kelsey - a fascinating sequence of photographs produced by C.C. Jones for the United States Geological Survey in 1879, following a major earthquake which claimed the lives of twenty- seven people. Unlike the sensationalist tabloids, Jones photographed buildings with almost imperceptible damage, and Kelsey writes that: the sublimity of Jones's photographs consists of the difference between tiny fissure and continental force, the gap between collating effects and comprehending causes and the effects of modernity's paradoxical amplification of both predictability and shock. It entails the defamiliarization of time (through compression) and society (by making violence into structure). It also gives the photographs a self-critical dimension. In many of them the inexplicable rift occurs within an orthogonal template that echoes the form of the photograph itself.64 I believe that an analogous process was evident in Evans's work, but of course the earthquake was an abstraction, an event in the economic order that involved a devastating demolition of artificially valued stocks that brought so many Americans into unemployment, starvation, and homelessness - the calamity that was so effectively described by Edmund Wilson as the 'American earthquake' . The Crash operated at a symbolic level - despite the mad clamour of the New York Stock Exchange, die sudden inexplicable snap that precipitated the downturn was silent and invisible, it could not in itself be perceived. Like a shockwave, it was evident only through the impact of its emanating force. The terrible consequences of the Crash and the Depression were available to photography as reportage of destitution, such as news photographs of Hoover villes and breadlines, and the WFPL's instrumental reports on class struggle. As I have argued, Evans's photographs of this time do not address the Depression directly but through their means of manufacture - an archival mode uncanny images of archaic spaces - located America as a damaged nation where mere houses registered the jolts of elemental yet invisible disturbances, as if documenting the aftermath of fiscal crimes by 206 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 62.

The Harvard circle was arguably the dominant force in the museological engagement with Modernism in America. Other members included Jere Abbott, associate director of MoMA until 1932 and then director of Smith College Museum of Art in Northampton, MA until 1946, and Arthur Everett 'Chick' Austin, Jr, who was director of the Wadsworth Athenaeum from 1927 to 1944. In political terms, the Harvard circle members were largely liberals or conservatives, with the exception of Philip Johnson, whose conversion to fascism was catalysed at a 1932 Nazi rally. His laudatory article 'Architecture of the Third Reich' appeared in Hound and Horn in the October- December 1933 issue. He resigned from MoMA following Machine Art in 1934 to found the Grey Shirts, a fascist group that failed dismally to find support. See Kazys Varnelis, '"We Cannot Know History": Philip Johnson's Politics and Cynical Sur vivai ', Journal of Architectural Education, vol. 49, no. 2, November 1995. 69. At MoMA, a key innovation was to examine Modernism across a range of disciplines through the establishment of different departments and a consonant engagement with the applied arts, but typically the radicalism of avant-garde totality, most fully realised in Russian Constructivism, was broken down into discrete areas, with movements identified, logged, and emptied of all revolutionary potential. Crises in modernity were of tangential interest and Modernism was ultimately a succession of fascinating styles, a garden of butterflies to be pinned and framed. Yet the valorisation of styles was nonetheless extensive and exhibitions such as Modern Architecture: International Exhibition (1932), Murals by American Painters and Photographers (1932), Theatre Art (1934), and. Machine Art (1934) did much to present the scope of Modernism. See the critique of functionalism in Henry- Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson, The International Style: Architecture Since 1922 (W. W. Norton and Co: New York, 1932) and Lincoln Kirstein, 'Bauhaus: Introductory Note', Catalogue of an Exhibition from the Bauhaus, Dessau, Germany, 13-28 March 1931 (The Arts Club of Chicago: Chicago, 1931). 70. Alfred H. Barr Jr, quoted in Christoph Grunenberg, 'The Politics of Presentation: Museums, Galleries, and Exhibitions in New York 1929-47' (PhD thesis, Courtauld Institute of marking the symbolic chalklines of an expired Americanism. These are portraits of empty American homes in an age of homelessness, both literal and figurative, where the unheimlich quality is doubled, suggesting further that these houses resist domestication, and casting America itself as semantically homeless. Combined together as multiples, these homeless houses did not form an archive as such but invoked the archive as the corollary of American standardisation. Instead of waging class war, which he was disinclined to do, Evans worked like a deadpan comedian generating subtle comic distortions, where an irrational second note paradoxically disrupted reification by drawing the viewer's attention to the peculiar thingness of things. Rather than shrieking humanist rage at the collective loss after the Crash, or castigating its progenitors, Evans applied a forensic editing of America, as if the future of the nation, about to collapse into ruination, could only be seen in the vanishing point of the present. Yet Evans's photographs deracinate the buildings and negate social difference - whether large house or small, villa, cottage, or shack, there was an equivalence that masked division and established relationships between the buildings as abstract objects. In other words, there was no archival specification but an abstraction into equivalence that oddly corresponded with a potential MoMA ideology. After all, the project witnessed a collision of the social interests of the persons involved. Like Wheelwright, Kirstein was a member of the quasi- aristocratic Harvard circle who well understood his distance from the middle class but permanently impecunious Evans, whose apartment was 'a particularly depressing hole in the wall. [Evans's and roommate Paul Grotz 's] poverty is really so sad, always implied but never mentioned' . Some of the more spectacular houses belonged to wealthy acquaintances of Kirstein and Wheelwright. They occupied a world of privilege that Evans orbited for purposes of patronage. The Harvard circle included Barr, Kirstein, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, and Philip Johnson - the modernist ideologues who were shaping the identity of MoMA. They were variously engaged in classifying contemporary art and culture, but abhorred the most stringently politicised rhetoric of the avant-garde. Classification here functioned to guide an eager, but uninformed patron class through the jungle of Modernism, itemising, evaluating, flattening, and rendering equivalent in a standardising process. In a confidential memo, Barr had candidly noted: basically, the Museum "produces" art knowledge, criticism, scholarship, understanding, taste' and thus 'the preparation of "production" work is the stuff of which the Museum's prestige is made' . Barr advised his colleagues to 'consider the Museum entirely as a business. If the product is good its duplication and distribution can be endless'. Nancy Einreinhofer has amply captured MoMA's essentially corporate identity: 'A Rockefeller . . . participated in the conception of the idea of the museum; a Rockefeller gave the land for the museum; the building resulted from Rockefeller donations, and the collection was built in large part with Rockefeller support. There has always been a Rockefeller on the Museum of Art boards, the Rockefeller philosophy of expansionism has prevailed' . If there was little space in this project for acute class differentiation, then it is equally difficult to ascertain an assertive ideology of the popular or even nostalgic folkish sentiments. While these images were broadly part of the 'American Scene', Americanism was a form of cultural nationalism, at times proselytised as a corrective to the vitiating influence of European culture, then Evans was hardly a eulogist of America. However, an obvious iconographie comparison lies with the numerous architectural paintings of OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 207</page><page sequence="18">Barnaby Harán Edward Hopper, where solitary houses articulate the sullen isolation of the uneventful daily lives of the unseen occupants. But Evans's photography abjures the nostalgia and melancholy of Hopper's 'American silences'. Eric de Chassey has considered these comparative projects extensively and concludes that Hopper's paintings of buildings carry implicit narratives about the absent inhabitants, through devices such as curtains billowing out of windows, whereas Evans's photographs resist narrative, partly because his compositions negate the world outside the frame. Also Hopper's paintings, drawings, and prints of empty buildings do not suggest multiples and were not a series as such, being shown either alone or in concert with other subjects. Hopper's habitual tendency to peer into these houses, with a voyeuristic interest in deshabillé young women, situates the unpopulated paintings as paeans to the hidden within the everyday via a tragic and libidinous gaze (indeed Hopper's portentous scenes suggest sex crimes, as underscored in the famous use of House by the Railroad as a model for the Bates House in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho). While restrained to the extent that the paintings resemble film stills, Hopper's sensate touch invoked the artist as contemplative genius and naturally differed from Evans's photographic remove, where authorial presence is doubly disrupted through the unseen eye of the bluntly impersonal archival mode, albeit paradoxically re-asserted through the exhibition process. Importantly, Hopper's first MoMA exhibition coincided with Evans's Victorian photographs show, and Kirstein noted how in Evans's images 'the focus was sharpened until so precise an image was achieved, that many of the houses seem to exist in an airless atmosphere, much as they exist in the airless nostalgia for the past to which Edward Hopper in his noble canvases pays a more personal tribute'. It should be stressed that beyond the distinction of painterly and camera vision Hopper's obeisance to a parochial and selective discourse on American heredity meant that his 'version of an American Modernism carried connotations of cultural chauvinism sustained by an ethnically exclusive conception of American identity' . The Victorian architecture photographs had a second life in American Photographs, a MoMA project over which Evans had greater control. A photobook in its own right, American Photographs featured an essay by Kirstein that provided a brief history of photography in which Evans was championed as a Modernist master, comparable with Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Cocteau, and Salvador Dalí. Essentially, consolidating the themes of the 1933 essay, Kirstein defined Evans as a maker of expressive documents. The book itself was divided into two parts, essentially portraits of people and buildings, respectively. Kirstein wrote evocatively: the photographs are arranged to be seen in their given sequence. They demand and should receive the slight flattery of your closest attention. They are not entirely easy to look at. They repel at an easy glance. They are so full of facts they have to be inspected with more care than quickness. The physiognomy of a nation is laid on your table.77 If Kirstein referred chiefly to the portraits of people in the last sentence, recalling Evans's description of Sander, then the sentiment just as easily applied to the buildings - the architectural photographs in the book present an uncanny double to these American faces. The sequencing of the photographs was significant, however, as Sekula has noted: Art, University of London: London, 1994), p. 171. 71. Grunenberg, The Politics of Presentation, p. 171. 72. Nancy Einreinhofer, The American Art Museum: Elitism and Democracy (Leicester University Press: Leicester, 1997), p. 163. 73. It is worth remembering the exhibition of Evans's Victorian photographs ensued two important displays of folk art at MoMA. These were Folk Art: The Art of the Common Man in America and American Painting and Sculpture, 1862-1932, which were put on by Holger Canili, whose previous exhibitions of folk art at the Newark Museum had been pioneering surveys of American vernacular culture. Canili was Acting Director of MoMA while Barr Jr took a sabbatical between September 1932 and May 1933.

Evans's book sequences, especially in his 1938 American Photographs, can be read as attempts to counterpose the "poetic" structure of the sequence to the model of the archive. Evans began the book with a prefatory note reclaiming his photographs from the various archival repositories that held copyright to or authority over his pictures.78 In this regard, Sekula cites Evans's 'antiarchival stance' concerning sequencing, where the arrangement of images related to 'conventions of cinematic editing'. Jean-François Chevrier invokes montage, and argues the significance of Leyda as the 'intermediary' who introduced Evans to the work of Eisenstein and Vertov.80 If Chevrier omits to mention either the contemporary discourse on montage in America or Leyda 's membership of the WFPL, then he argues for a less politically strategic type of editing. Evans's arrangement of images in American Photographs was essentially post-production editing - 'he ceaselessly altered the framing of his photos, fragmenting them, extracting details that he would then combine with other images' - and thus the photographs constituted an 'open work', an analogue of the editorial practices of the cinema and the press. He suggests that in the second part of American Photographs the correlation of the editorial process and depicted buildings is especially evident in the sequencing: the order may be very strict, dictated now by the austere regularity of the frame houses or the neo-classical alignments, now by the uniformity of a standardized shot (frontality and shallowness of field, for example)- but this order is always contradicted by the discordance, indeed the incongruity of the details, by the accelerations of the montage.82 If Evans had editorial control of American Photographs, then he had limited influence over sequencing in 1933 - the show was hastily assembled by Kirstein from a selection of photographs that he had personally donated to the museum (after all, as patron he owned the photographs, a fact that perhaps irked Evans as yet another case of sacrificing the rights to his images). However, I would be misreading Sekula 's trope of an 'antiarchival stance' in using it to bolster Evans's later claim of 'anti- Americanism' and thus to suggest a 'counter archive', generated via montage against an Americanism defined by the standardisation of industry in Fordism and Taylorism or the equivalence of value in the classifying practices of MoMA. The work was surely not an emotive plea bargain against house arrest, an outcry against the systemic oppressiveness of the archive, but reflected an incisive and curious photographic mode - Evans later referred to the 'psychology of camera work' whereby the photographer 'collects and edits the world about him'.83 Both Sekula and Chevrier draw attention to Evans's praise for Sander's 'photographic editing of society', yet for all his fascination and disgust Evans never envisaged any reconfiguration of America, as evident in his resistance to propaganda and scepticism towards radical political organisations. If Evans's sequencing of American Photographs was critically 'antiarchival', it was also anti-utopian, and hardly montage in the Party-oriented instrumental mode of John Heartfield or Gustav Klutsis but closer to, if not identical with, Benjamin's generic monteur who could cut through appearances with surgical precision. Coincidentally, Kirstein recalled 'I felt like a surgeon's assistant to Walker. Cleaning up after him, and he a surgeon operating on the fluid body of time'.8 Although this vague poetic rendition fails to match the sharpness of Benjamin's classification, the metaphor successfully captured Evans's clinical analysis of a damaged America, out of kilter and out of time. Evans himself noted that time and space were the keys to the New Vision: 'the element of OXFORD ART JOURNAL 33.2 2010 209</page><page sequence="20">Barnaby Harán time entering into photography provides a departure for as much speculation as an observer cares to make. Actual experiments in time, actual experiments in space suit a post-war state of mind' . His own photographs marked disjuncture in the contemporary American scene, witnessing an emergent Depression state of mind, and collectively formed a haunting portrait of a homeless nation. 85.
