Cormorant fishing is no longer profitable commercially. That at Gifu in Japan is operated as a tourist attraction under the subsidy of the Imperial household. The articles "Birds on Stamps" by W. F. Stanley of the State University College, New York and "Birds on Coins" by V. Clain-Stefanelli of the U. S. National Museum deserve special commendation. They will undoubtedly make bird-watchers out of stamp and coin collectors and vice versa. All in all Birds in Our Lives is a very fine book, well illustrated and one of the best book-buys of the decade.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 47. The Whooping Crane / the bird that defies extinction. Faith McNulty. 1966. E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York. 189 pages, illustrated. $4.95. The only fault I can find with this book is its blatantly anthropomorphic subtitle, probably foisted on it by its sales-minded publishers. A far more suitable one, "The thread remains very thin," was given it by the New Yorker magazine, which published much of the book's contents in slightly different form. This fits the circumstances much more accurately. As the book clearly and unmistakably points out, the Whooping Crane has not "defied" extinction, but is barely man- aging to survive, thanks largely to the efforts of the National Audubon Society, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and a handful of dedicated individuals, chief among them my friend, the late Robert Porter Allen, whom the author calls most fittingly the crane's "most ardent and learned champion." While Mrs. McNulty does not claim to be an ornithologist, and so far as I know this is the only article on birds she has published, the book shows her to be a highly capable researcher, an excellent reporter, and a fine writer. She does not seem to have missed a single potential source of information, published or un- published, and she reports a number of significant behind-the-scenes developments she could have learned only by interviewing those close to the events. Most revealing is her delineation of the activities of George Douglass, recently deceased director of the New Orleans zoo, whose maneuverings continually hampered efforts to propagate the species in captivity. The book adds up to a fine contribution to ornithological literature, a clear and lucid exposition of the current status of the Whooping Crane and the species' recent history. The author's simple, straightforward prose maintains the drama and excitement of the case from start to finish, and thank goodness the end is not yet. The birds still have a chance, and efforts such as Mrs. McNulty's in arousing public opinion with such writing are certain to help. I wish every senator and congressman could be made to read it!-O. L. Austin, Jr. 48. Flight Mechanisms and the Orientation of Birds. (Mekhanizmy poleta i orientatsii ptits). S. E. Kleinenberg, editor. 1966. Published for the A. N. Severtsov Institute of Animal Morphology by "Nauka" Publishing House, Moscow. 224 pp. Price 1 ruble, 10 kopecks (about $2.00 U. S.). This book con- sists of an introduction by the editor and eight substantial and well-documented review articles by various authors each with an English summary. In "Some considerations on bionic investigations in ornithology", by N. V. Kokshaiskii the science of "bionics" is defined as a scientific trend attempting to elucidate and apply principles of structure and function evolved by biological systems to the solution of problems in human technology. The use of aims, methods, and prospects of bionically-oriented studies in ornithology is exempli- fied in the problem of flapping-flight. The author suggests that the significance of this problem (other than ornithological) is not so much in creation of flapping- wing aircraft as in the basic physical concepts of "thrust" and "drag." The author states that birds (and all other animals that fly or swim) have long since developed some "thrust generating mechanism" the essential features of which are still unknown. Several possible factors are discussed. In "Mechanization and automation of the birds' wing" by V. E. Yacobi, structural devices presumably effecting increase of lift (wing-tip slots, features of wing surface and of particular feathers) are discussed. Wing automation is mani- fested in adjustments to aerodynamic conditions as afforded by structure of certain feathers, location of their ligaments. and structure of boundary between calamus and rhachis.</page></plain_text>
