This essay attempts briefly to re-evaluate a few of the existing ideas concern ing the development of sculptural art in Bengal, particularly in its initial phase, as manifested through the medium of terracotta. The 19th century in India was dominated by the study of architecture with three savants on centre stage: James Fergusson, Alexander Cunningham, and James Burgess. Despite their pioneering initia tives and investigating enterprises, they appear to have been unable to cope with sculptural art. If at all, sculpture was an auxiliary subject for them. Also in their scholarship there was hardly any separate existence for Bengal, and obviously, none for the art of Bengal. The study of architecture was considered as primary because it was regarded by the Indians as the most important of the visual arts. Therefore, for the pioneers, it was the earliest of the arts which received careful and analytic treatment. In these studies, Bengal's presence was negligible, for there was very little evidence available till then, of surviving worthwhile architecture. Mahasthangarh, Paharpur, Bangarh, Chandraketugarh, Mainamati, Rajabadidanga and other sites were yet to be excavated by the archaeologists. The transition to the twentieth century saw not much dif ference until about the second decade. Anew spurt of enthusiasm was visible in the collection of ancient relics, mainly sculptures, under the aegis of the newly established museums at Dhaka and Rajshahi. Not that the older Indian Museum at Calcutta was idle, but that had become the grand storehouse of objects from the whole of India and even beyond. The sculptures from Bengal, though not unimpressive in number, were relegated to being considered second rate items as compared to those from Bharhut, Gandhara, Mathura, Sarnath, Amaravati and Bodhgaya.</page><page sequence="3">ENAMUL HAOUE / 189 Within a span of half a dozen years, exactly between 1928 and 1933, there appeared a sudden flurry of publications related to Bengal art, all of which focused on sculpture. These were out standing works and remain so till today, even after the passage of such a long time and even though, naturally, many of their observations and conclusions have been superseded. J.C. French (1928), N.K. Bhattasali (1929), Stella Kramrisch (1930) and R.D. Banerji (1933), together introduced a plethora of publications on sculpture from eastern India, treating the subject from the standpoint of historical development. Among them, N.K. Bhat tasali specifically dealt with iconography, breaking altogether new grounds. The most noticeable and common feature of these publica tions was that, in the absence of an appreciable corpus of art material from the early period, the principal preoccupation of these authors had been the sculptures from Bihar and Bengal. These were the specimens in stone and bronzes found in various public and private collections, belonging to a period of political pre-eminence of the Pala and Sena dynasties from the eighth to twelfth centuries. It was even considered that this was the only period of art activity in Bengal, before the Muslim conquest. The above authors, except N.K. Bhattasali, were committed to pursu ing the dynastic art of the Palas and Senas, disregarding any territorial differences between Bengal and Bihar. Obviously, there was no harm in trying to establish other dynastic art idioms in India beside those of the Maurya, Sunga, Kushan, Gupta and later eras. Dynastic periodisation was their essential preoccupation, taking precedence over geographic affinities. The impact of these works was further enhanced by S.K. Saraswati: first, by his three reports of four tours undertaken in the districts of north Bengal (1932,1936), and subsequently, by his pioneering brochure on pre-Pala sculpture (1938). In this latter publication, Saraswati left out the art of the terracotta "as this branch of art, being particularly the art of Bengal, should justly be reserved for a separate treatment". Years later, in 1962, Saras wati redeemed his promise when he brought out an enlarged second edition of this brochure as a full-fledged book, incorporat ing most of the terracotta materials discovered in Bengal. Here was a definite attempt to identify a distinct place for Bengal</page><page sequence="4">190 / Reflections on the Early Art of Bengal sculpture out of the corpus of the more extensive and numerous "Pala-Sena" sculpture. The importance of Bengal art, both sculpture and architec ture, rose at once to a new level of significance when the piecemeal reports of the excavations at Paharpur were presented in a single volume by its excavator K.N. Dikshit (1938). Besides the architec tural importance of the site, never before had so large a number of stone and terracotta sculptures in situ been unearthed in the whole of the sub-continent. The former dependence on Pala-Sena stone sculpture to evaluate the art of Bengal were now supple mented with voluminous terracotta material adorning the colos sal brick temple at the centre of Paharpur monastery. The continuous bands of terracotta plaques, set in recessed panels around the basement and the walls of the circumambulatory passages in the upper terraces, represented 'a local and in digenous trend, popular in inspiration and imagination, as well as in appeal'.1 Three other works on Bengal sculptures, basically three University dissertations done almost simultaneously, not only augmented knowledge on the subject but demonstrated some new trends in methodology and comprehension. The publica tions by Frederick Asher (1971), Susan L. Huntington (1972) and Enamul Haque (1973) presented together a large number of hitherto unnoticed images. Asher and Huntington, pursuing micro-level investigation, primarily dealt with the development of styles during 300-800 and 800-1200 A.D. respectively. Later their works were published in 1980 and 1984, after substantially adding fresh knowledge based on further field trips to Bihar and Bengal. Whereas the two authors covered the geographical east ern India, the work of the present author, published in 1992, specifically concerned sculptures from Bengal alone. For the first time, a quantitative assessment was presented of the iconography of Hindu sculptures from Bengal up to the mid-thirteenth century, based on the analysis of an unprecedented number of 1860 im ages, located in different private and public collections. In all the works cited so far, the general preoccupation of the authors were to deal with stone and bronze sculptures, mainly from the Gupta period onwards. A handful of pre-Gupta specimens were hardly enough to engage them into a special investigation of the early plastic art of Bengal, particularly in the</page><page sequence="5">ENAMULHAQUE / 191 pre-Christian centuries. However, sporadic explorations and ex cavations in different sites of Bengal between 1930s and 1960s brought about astonishing changes in prevailing opinions. The surface finds, followed by excavations at Mahasthangarh, Ban garh and Chandraketugarh, and a few other places, unearthed a host of early terracotta materials—at once confirming large scale art activities in north, west and south Bengal. Thus S.S. Biswas got a welcome opportunity for presenting in a single volume in 1981 a selection from these terracotta figures. However considering the number and variety of material, it must be said that a full-scale study of the terracotta art from Bengal is yet to be undertaken. All the excavated objects from Chandraketugarh art (CKGR) numbering several thousands ac cording to the brief annual reports published in the pages of Indian Archaeology: A Review, are placed in the Ashutosh Museum of Indian Art at Calcutta University. It is a pity that no initiative has been taken as yet to study or evaluate this indispensable wealth of early Bengal art, since the closure of the excavations in 1967. Not even a consolidated excavation report for the years 1955-67 has been published as yet. Recently, the present author has made an attempt to summarise the excavation results from CKGR, based on the excerpts published earlier in the IAR.2 But this is not, and cannot be, a substitute for a regular excavation report by the actual excavators. The situation has become more acute. During the last decade, the western art markets were literally flooded with materials from CKGR area, collected from surface explorations and from clandestine excavations by treasure hunters. These transactions might have begun during the last two or three decades. One believes that this outward flow of antiquities remains unabated as is evidenced by the demands of the museums and individual collectors. Needless to say, they fetch amounts that were incon ceivable only a few years ago. When I was in the U.S.A. in 1992-93, I spent considerable amount of time, deviating from my set course of research, in gathering information about these objects. I had the privilege of examining the holdings of a few museums, dealers and private collectors. With the permission and encouragement of the owners, I felt tempted to study nearly five hundred of such specimens, almost entirely unknown to the Indian scholars. The result is awaiting publication soon.</page><page sequence="6">Terracotta plaque, from Chandraketugarh, courtesy: Dr Enamul Haque</page><page sequence="7">ENAMULHAQUE / 193 This fresh evidence has brought to life the hitherto unknown early history and culture of Bengal. It has revealed an ancient horizon, particularly of early art, indeed unveiling a panorama of life comparable to any matured civilisation of the ancient world. Among the new discoveries, the terracotta artefact has surpassed the other associated materials. This is a befitting tribute to the geographical traditions of the alluvial plain of Bengal, criss-crossed by innumerable rivers and streams. The early terracottas of Bengal offer an extraordinary variety of themes and subjects. They not only represent manifold affairs of social life that the artists could see around them, but often scenes conceived with imagination. They are conveniently clas sified as individual male and female figures often described as Yakshas, Yakshis, Apsaras, Kinnaras etc., animals, birds, toys of animal figures, some of which were recognised as emblems of cults, narrative plaques representing legends, mythology, erotic motifs, decorated pottery, and seals and sealings. The individual female figures have been identified by many to be representing some form of the ancient cult of the mother goddess like those found in many other countries. In spite of inadequacy in knowledge about these early sculptures, no doubt they will ul timately, illustrate the history and culture of Bengal. Human figures in terracotta from the early period have been found in large number in various other sites of India, but apparently fewer in number than from Bengal. These are yet to be definitely iden tified either as divinities or mortals. At this stage we may take a fresh look at the traditionally accepted views about the well-known dynastic sway over Bengal, or parts of it, by the Mauryas, Sungas and Kushanas. It is known that the Ashokan pillars with their animal capitals were widely dispersed along the well-travelled pilgrimage and trade routes. Whether they attest to the movement of the finished works of art from one single manufacturing centre to various sites, or to the movement of artists themselves along these routes, it is disap pointing to note that not a single Ashokan column has been discovered in Bengal. The Magadhan connection to Tamralipti or to Pundravardhana, for commercial or administrative purposes is, rather well known and not difficult to imagine. Bengal, as is today, must have been then the most populous region of the subcontinent. But still no royal edict appears to have been issued for the people of the region. It is therefore, not totally un</page><page sequence="8">194 / Reflections on the Early Art of Bengal reasonable to doubt, that the northern and the southwestern parts of Bengal were ever within the bounds of the Ashokan empire. This is not to say that the movements of artistic ideas stopped at the Bihar-Bengal border. Whatever may have been the political status, the discovery of the much-noted Brahmi inscription of the 2nd 1st century B.C. at Mahastangarh, and the legend of Ashoka's visit to the port city of Tamralipti, suggest connections. On the contrary, a set of common Gangetic valley patterns and motifs, at least in the cases of terracotta objects, appear over an extensive area along the Ganges, providing insights into the movement of cultural boundaries. Allowance must be made for the fact that since the sites and regions in Bengal in particular and eastern India in general, during the ancient period, were not insular, local traditions alone could not account for the development of stylistic trends in a given locality. Similarly, it is not accurately known as to how much of Bengal was under the actual rule of the Sungas, or the Kushans or for that matter, or whether the region was at all ruled by these dynasties. However obscure the political details of Bengal in the pre-Gupta period, we have not insignificant evidence to link the art of Bengal with the north. Therefore, until we have satisfactori ly developed a separate yardstick of periodisation for the early art of Bengal, we have to continue with the use of the dynastic appellations on an all-Indian scale, such as the Mauryan, Sunga and Kushan? Although excavations have revealed that the earliest phase of occupation at CKGR goes back to the pre-Mauryan age, ex cavators did not mention the find of any terracotta figurines from this level. They identified such material from subsequent phases, covering the Maurya to the Gupta period. Truly speaking, the terracottas from the Mauryan occupational levels were extremely rare from the excavations at CKGR. Notable among them were two female heads with elaborate coiffures, one wearing a bicor nate head-dress and the other with circular medallions and pre cious ornaments, all shown in applique technique. A few more specimens from this epoch are known from the surface finds. The next phase is dominated by the abundance of ar chaeological materials with a set of distinct characteristics. These are terracotta plaques of an idiom bearing the name of the Sunga dynasty. In fact, the style was strong and persistent, substantially remaining effective even after the fall of the dynasty in about 75</page><page sequence="9">ENAMUL HAQUE / 195 B.C. The Sunga decades played a significant role in the formative stages of the development of Bengal art. The most revolutionary achievement of the short-lived Sunga period was the introduction of the mould technique in place of modelling. This helped to speed up the production of the terracotta pieces to meet the demands of an expanding clientele. An increased use of the mould helped the transition from the round figures of the early period to the composition of the flat relief. During the Kushan period, a more intense contact appears to have existed between the Hellenistic world and deltaic Bengal. Sensitive local artists could not have missed the visiting aliens, with their strong and distinctive features and costumes. These immigrants would soon be in the forefront of commercial ac tivities in and through Bengal, even introducing their own im ported Kharosti scripts into the daily transactions. Naturally, they found thqir place on the terracotta plaques in large numbers.3 Regarding the themes and subjects, the repertoire of the Kushan artists was as varied as in the immediate preceding period. The plastic medium, now much influenced by the vigorous physical form, would further be transformed by the emphasis on nudity. The low relief of the Sunga period would develop into plaques with bold and high features, almost conveying a sense of three dimensional effect. With their characteristic roundness of feature in the later Kushan phase, these figurines usually stand in ex tremely flexible positions, demonstrating an unprecedented pliability of the figure, that accentuates beauty of the human form. Thus the terracotta art of early Bengal reached its zenith during the Sunga-Kushan epochs. Bengal appears to have missed a fresh stimulus in technol ogy at this juncture as compared with the neighbouring middle Gangetic valley. There, besides probable foreign technical hands, some of the terracotta artists were engaged in the newly- introduced art of stone carving. The new medium was a challenge to them, and their new productions lack the lustre and refinement of the skilled professionals. It is therefore difficult to sustain the previously held opinion of some scholars that the stone edifices of Bharhut Bodhgaya and Sanchi were earlier in date than 'skilled terracotta modelling of the profusely orna mented female figures.4 The comparatively heavy and static fea tures of human form with hardly any suggestion of volume on</page><page sequence="10">Terracotta plaque from Chandraketugarh, courtesy: Dr Enamul Haque</page><page sequence="11">ENAMUL HAQUE / 197 the stone surface were not necessarily earlier than the vibrant Sunga-Kushan phase of the terracotta art. Rather, they were either contemporary or even later in time—from the hands of the same terracotta artists who had been introduced only recently to the new medium of stone. In early terracotta art the dominant majority represent women. In a recent study of the previously unpublished pieces from CKGR alone, the author found 226 individual female against 110 male figures. As many as 176 plaques, both complete and fragmentary, depict a standing two-armed lady bedecked with rich details of ornamentation all over the body, elaborate head dresses and designed costumes, reminding us of the outstanding Yakshi piece from Tamluk, now preserved at Oxford. Scholars have broadly classified them as Yakshas and Yakshis, due to their similarity with the iconography of sculptured specimens often with identifying labels at Bharhut, Bodhgaya, Sanchi, Patna, Parkham and other places. These Yakshas and Yakshis were at tributed with supernatural powers and "were it not for the names inscribed upon them would be taken for princely donors or rich merchants and their wives..." 5 It is to be noted that while the artists and their patrons in Bengal were satisfied with terracotta plaques of tiny format, and with comparatively fewer three-dimensional figures, also in ter racotta, there were stone figures of various dimensions, even larger than life-size, in contemporary and nearby Bihar. Monumentality and impressiveness are not determined by size alone. The females in these plaques, in spite of their diminutive size, demonstrate no less brightness in conception and monumen tal effect than the renowned larger them life-size Yakshi from Didarganj. The CKGR ladies cannot be denied to have achieved a real effect of majesty. The heavily jewelled lady survives as a record of the physical and psychological experience of the people, as well as their thoughts and aspirations. At CKGR, most terracottas possess an almost complete standardization of costumes. Ornaments, decoration, with the general pose and expression of the body. This leads us to believe that the artists were duty-bound to translate into clay some sort of convention sanctioned by long usage. The discovery of pieces with almost identical features, even though with different styles, at so many distant places along the Gangetic valley, only strengthens this assumption. Yet, we cannot be sure as to whether</page><page sequence="12">198 / Reflections on the Early Art of Bengal the terracotta images were enshrined or worshipped. Most probably not. Their vast numbers suggests that they were popular household items. It is a plain truth that the so-called Yakshi figurines of CKGR represent the natural charm and ethereal grace of feminine beauty The society that patronised such items were amply bestowed with an aesthetics capable of sustaining the creative expressions of its own people. A few scholars have iden tified vyantara devatas in the terracotta plagues from CKGR such as Lakshmi, Surya, Indra, Agni, Kubera etc. in their preliminary stages of iconographic appearances. The number of such pieces are few, and such conclusions are at best tentative. Also, there are some doubtful depiction of the Jatakas. Strikingly, the epics and the emerging puranas had almost no sway over the artists at CKGR. There is a general consensus that religion had been the primary source of art at every age. Terracotta art in early Bengal clearly demonstrates that the case can be, at least partially and substantially, different. With the decline of urban cities and the rise of the new feudal culture under the domination of the landed gentry, the character of Bengal terracotta also changed. This was the time when ter racotta themes started transforming from largely secular to religious themes. Soon elaborate images from the Buddhist, Brah manical and Jain pantheon, or iconography, overtake the entire spectrum of art activities. Terracotta art did not die altogether, but went through a new transformation. It now emerged as a part of surface embellishment on the walls of the brick temples of stupas. Besides being used as mouldings of different shapes and designs, they were now manufactured as panels depicting a variety of themes, both religious and secular. But the religious themes, newly introduced, required inscribed labelling of an elementary nature for the ordinary population, urban or rural. The artists or their patrons were conscious about the unfamiliarity of the mas ses with even the principal characters of epics such as the Ramayana. This happened with the recently discovered terracotta panels from Saralpur and Palashbari, villages on the outskirts of Mahasthangarh, the ancient capital city of Pundravardhana, en joying uninterrupted urban status since at least the Maurya period.5 The labelling of sculptures at Bharhut, Mathura and else where may suggest that the figures depicted were not well known previously, or there was no tradition, perhaps, for</page><page sequence="13">ENAMUL HAQUE / 199 picturisation of well-known religious stories. The particular religion must have been introduced in that locality only recently Significantly, the innumerable plaques from CKGR have not produced a single piece with any label, indicating that the depicted figures must have been fairly popular to the community for a considerable period of time. Numerous seals with cryptic writings have been discovered. It is likely that these labelled art materials from Saralpur and Palashbari, the first of its kind from Bengal, and that also in terracotta, probably were made at a comparatively initial stage of the introduction of this Brahmanical epic in the region. The terracotta artists of the previous centuries were not accustomed to make panels of such religious sig nificance, or perhaps there were no proper patrons. This supposition appears most likely to be a valid one, at least on the basis of available archaeological finds. It is a well-known fact that only two pieces of stone sculptures have so far been found from the pre-Gupta Bengal, with definite Kushan idiom. A solitary fragmentary figure in mottled red sandstone has been found from CKGR, depicting the head and bust of a Buddha-Bod hisattva which has been recognised to have "distinct affinities with Kushana art idiom".6 It has been surmised that this stone n image was "made at a Mathura workshop and exported". The other piece is the headless standing figure in non-local red stone, tentatively identified as Karttikeya, from the outskirts of Mahas thangarh in Bogra district. Even though "The figure is close enough in overall composition to a fine Kusana Karttikeya from Mathura now in the Mathura Museum, and to several other Kusana Mathura images of this deity now in the State Museum, Lucknow, to have been modeled on this type of figure", it has been concluded that the "sculpture is clearly a provincial production".8 This conclusive opinion lacks adequate support or evidence, and the statement quoted itself suggests that the piece was an im ported one. During the Maurya through the Kushan eras, the terracotta artists in Bengal, and for that matter, the artist community in general, were mainly engaged in the production of objects in terracotta and a few other mediums, but excluding stone. The two stone images referred to above, representing the well established Buddhist and Brahmanical faiths, were not manufactured locally and, perhaps, were meant for non-local residents.</page><page sequence="14">Terracotta plaque, from Chandraketugarh, courtesy: Dr Enatnul Haque</page><page sequence="15">ENAMULHAQUE / 201 This gives us ground to suppose that the expansion of Aryanisation in Bengal was rather slow as compared to the mid east Gangetic valley. Progress in the principal religions in those regions required the production of anthropomorphic deities to satisfy their votaries. But the people of the lower Gangetic delta did not appear to have accepted the classic religions to such an extent. Consequently, they were not required to produce such religious deities, although they were prolific, in producing ter racotta figures of various themes, either secular or of their own belief, or an unknown denomination. The early art of Bengal, like every other art, is to be under stood in its own circumstances, and history. The combined perusal of the limited number of excavated materials, and those found through clandestine methods, reveal that the impetus for the manufacturing of art objects in large number grew towards the close of the Maurya era—when contact between the region and the Hellenistic lands gathered momentum. At about the same time, the discovery of the monsoon wind by Hippalus brought a boost to maritime trade between Bengal and the West. The resul tant economic factor cannot be ignored. The Javani woman might have inspired the delicate and sensitive modelling of the Yakshi or the Apsaras. When Graeco-Roman art was enriching the Gandhar countries of northwest India in stone and stucco and the Mathura idioms were consolidating the foundation of the in digenous art on the middle Ganges valley, Bengal was vibrating with a prolific production in terracotta. It was indeed a cultural upheaval of unprecedented dimension. The inspiration and yearnings of the artists remained satisfied with delicate and sen sitive terracottas of small dimension, displaying superb power and dexterity. Indeed, the creativity of the Bengal art found its best expression, at least during the early centuries of its emer gence, in these terracottas. Notes 1. S.K. Saraswati, 1962, p.108 2.
