<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton, Homer, and Hyacinthus: Classical Iconography and Literary Allusion in Paradise Lost 4.300-303 BRUCE THOMAS BOEHRER Milton's initial description of Adam at Paradise Lost 4.288-303 exhibits three separate but concur- rent tendencies: a commitment to depict Adam's physical constitution as distinct from, but repre- sentative of, the divine image in which he has been made; a tendency to model Adam's physical appearance upon Milton's own; and a fondness for mythological references that place Adam's ap- pearance in a tradition of heroic beauty exemplified by his "Hyacinthin locks" (4.301). In concert, these tendencies associate Milton himself with the iconography of classical myth, while endowing the poet's presentation of Adam with homoerotic overtones. when they first appear in Paradise Lost, Adam and Eve offer a tacit gloss on human- kind's creation in Genesis 1.26: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe but in true filial freedom plac't.1 The image of God, as presented here, predictably consists of abstract qualities, nor is it mere coincidence that these are three in number. Seventeenth-century definitions of the image of God, as this was imparted to humanity through the act of creation, often "rail... against" the anthropomorphic idea that the image in question was a physical one;2 like- I am deeply grateful to Wolfgang Haase and to IJCT's three anonymous readers of this paper for their generous help in preparing it for print. 1.

And by figuring God's image through the notions of "Truth, wisdome" and "Sanctitude," as expressed in turn via the exercise of "filial freedom," Milton again conforms to well-established modes of Biblical interpretation that locate the image of God in such qualities as "mind, will, memory, free will.., justice, sanctity, innocence."4 But although God's image in humankind is not a physical one--that is, even though God has not fashioned Adam and Eve on the pattern of a corporeality of his own-there is still something about the human body that advertises the presence of the abstract image within. While the body may not, in this sense, be accounted the image of God, it nonetheless functions as an image of that image, referring to what can't be seen. This sig- nifying process, composed out of difference (the body is not the image) and deferral (the body stands in for and thereby displaces the image, which remains at a referential dis- tance), is what Derrida has called diffirance. For his part, Milton liked to call it 'expression,' as when the Attendant Spirit in A Mask Presented at Ludlow-Castle describes the "human count'nance" as "Th'express resemblance of the gods" (68-69). On this model, the human body's (and face's) composition attests to the exceptional quality of the mind and spirit it houses. Milton adheres to this notion from beginning to end of his career, perhaps because, it, too, is conventional. In Sylvester's translation of Du Bartas, God forms Adam, Yet, not his face downe to the Earthward bending (Like Beasts that but regard their bellie, ending For ever all) but toward th'azure Skies Bright golden Lampes lifting his lovely Eyes; That through their nerves, his better part might looke Still to that Place from whence her birth she tooke.5 Likewise Anthony Nixon, writing in 1612, declared that "God hath given Man an vpright shape, to the intent he might cast off the care of base and earthly matters to contemplate heauenly. No other creature, but Man hath the backe-bone made according to the streightnesse of the legges."6 This is the tradition Milton follows when he describes Adam and Eve as being "of nobler shape" than the lower animals, "erect and tall,/Godlike erect." 3.

Here the pairing of "image" and "similitude" recalls the pre- cise form of God's deliberations at Genesis 1.26 ("Let us make man in our image after our likeness"), and while most exegetes have preferred either to regard "likeness" as denot- ing supernatural (i.e. spiritual) as opposed to natural (i.e. intellectual) gifts,7 or to con- strue it as "a tautological reflex of image," it may also be read to "imply a distinction be- tween the soul and the body."8 Milton's use here of the adjective "express," in turn, has been viewed as an implicit assertion "that Adam and Eve resemble God corporeally as well as intellectually."9 Yet their physical resemblance to the Father-like the "human count'nance" of A Mask-offers a specifically mediated form of access to the divine image, troped as the emergence into view (expressio) of an enclosed, occulted object. So Milton invests Adam and Eve, quite conventionally, with the image of God the Father through their possession of intellectual attributes like "wisdome" and the capacity for attaining "Truth," and through their exercise of the spiritual quality of "Sanctitude," all as displayed via the practice of "filial freedom." As for their bodies, Milton depicts these, too, in highly conventional fashion, as the repositories of a kind of secondary image, a visible marker of the divinity within. In describing the body's function as such, Milton lends special weight to certain physical characteristics, and these, too, were con- ventionally viewed as distinguishing humankind from the lower creation. Adam and Eve's upright posture, as we have seen, is one such "godlike" property, but unsurpris- ingly enough, their facial features receive similar attention, providing evidence of God's image through their relative flatness and broadness, their mobility of expression, their high forehead and clearly-demarcated hairline. Aristotle's declaration that "of all living beings..,. man alone partakes of the divine" finds a natural concomitant in his assertion that "the part [of animals] that lies under the skull is called the 'face': but in the case of man only."'0 These claims, in turn, feed into a broad tradition of early modern "self- congratulation" regarding the uniqueness of humankind and its preeminence over the rest of creation, and this, finally, informs Milton's description of the "human count'- nance" as "th'express resemblance of the gods."" 7. This distinction, which is "most certainly the commonest explanation of the passage in ques- tion" (Claus Westermann, Genesis: A Commentary, vol. 1: Genesis 1-11, trans. John J. Scullion [Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1984], 149; German original: Claus Westermann, Genesis, vol. 1: Genesis 1-11 [Biblischer Kommentar.

This much is well known. I. But as satisfying as all of this may be, it begs at least one obvious question: if God's image of Adam is an abstract one, what is the source of Adam's physical appearance? When he cre- ated humanity, the Father himself may not have been working from a preexistent model, but John Milton was most certainly using such a model when he described the creative act. Where does that model come from, and what does it tell us about Milton's poem? Not all details of this model prove equally unexpected, of course. Few readers will be stunned to discover, for instance, that Milton's Adam and Eve are Caucasian and "fair" (4.477), yet even such predictable associations reveal how the original couple em- bodies concrete aesthetic and ethnographic precedents. And beyond questions of skin- color, the following lines merit-and have received-considerable scrutiny: [Adam's] fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad. (4.300-303) Brief though this passage may be, it offers rich insight into Milton's visual concep- tion of Adam. In part, its detail reinforces the poem's traditionalist reading of the divine image; Adam's "eye sublime," for instance, declares "Absolute rule" through its elevated (sublimis) gaze, which is made possible by his erect posture, which likewise differentiates him from the lower animals. His "fair large Front," on the other hand, has been subject to an equally-unified but nonetheless more questionable range of comment. Most editors seem satisfied that the "Front" in question is Adam's forehead,12 and Roy Flannagan goes on to assert that "A large forehead ('Front') was supposed to indicate intelligence, as in the modern 'egghead'."'3 But if this was the common view of large foreheads in Milton's day (which it may or may not have been), there were certainly writers who disagreed. Thomas Hill's physiognomic treatise The contemplation ofmankinde (1571), for instance, re- marks that The foreheade large, doth indicate such a person to be inclined often to chaunge both minde and purpose: but if the foreheade be very large, then such a person (for the more parte) is noted to be a foole, of small discretion, and dull witted.14 12.

W. Norton, 1975), 86 n. 300, who glosses "large Front" as "broad forehead"; and Flannagan 451 n. 89. 13. Flannagan, 451 n. 89. 14. Thomas Hill, The contemplation of mankinde (London: William Seres, 1571), f. 32.</page><page sequence="5">Boehrer 201 This, in turn, echoes Hill's earlier translation of Bartolommeo della Rocca Codes, who as- serts that "The forehead verye greate, declareth that man to be slowe and a heauy goer on the earth, a dullard and folyshe, compared to the Oxe."'s And this observation, in its turn, hearkens back to the pseudo-Aristotelian Physiognomica, which remarks that "A small forehead means stupidity, as in swine: too large a forehead, lethargy, as in cattle."'16 Not that any of this settles the matter: physiognomy was nothing if not a variable and capricious discipline. For Johannes ab Indagine, for instance, "A large forhed beto- keneth a liberal ma[n]."17 And just after it associates the over-large forehead with lethargy, the Physiognomica observes that "A square and well-proportioned forehead is a sign of a proud soul, as in the lion."'8 So what does all this mean for Paradise Lost? Little or nothing, I suspect. I suspect, rather, that Milton drew the contours of Adam's face from places other than the physiog- nomic manuals. This point is well illustrated by yet another detail from Milton's descrip- tion of Adam: his "parted forelock." In researching visual sources for this particular hairstyle, Roland Mushat Frye sur- veyed the iconographic record and concluded that "The Adam of Paradise Lost is in this regard almost unique, but not quite. We know two men who wore their hair with a parted forelock just like that of Milton's Adam: they were Oliver Cromwell and John Mil- ton."'9 Amidst a variety of more or less conventional visual detail, the parted forelock stands out through its sheer idiosyncracy. As Frye summarizes matters, Adam's forelock "obviously has no connection with..,. the 'lovelock'" of the cavaliers, "nor can it be as- sociated with the short fringe of hair (corta frangetta or frangetta sulla fronte) which was also sometimes encountered in the seventeenth century," nor can it be connected with the scraggly single forelock "ascribed in emblems to Time or Occasion," nor does it cor- respond to the "single and undivided forelocks" that appear in the surviving portraits of such figures as Nicholas Hilliard, Sir Francis Drake, William Camden, Algernon Sidney and Bulstrode Whitelock.20 However, it does correspond to how Milton wears his hair in the most influential surviving portrait of the poet as an adult: the engraved likeness pro- duced by William Faithorne for the 1670 edition of Milton's History of Britain. There the sixty-two-year-old Milton faces the viewer sombrely, his head framed by shoulder- length, flowing locks, parted in the middle, with an eyebrow-length wisp of hair straying down onto his forehead on either side. This hairstyle was sufficiently distinctive to have earned a brief footnote in the his- tory of eighteenth-century Milton reception. In 1780, Francis Blackburne offered an ac- count, based on prior records and hearsay, of a visit made "about the year 1725" to Mil- ton's surviving daughter, Deborah Clark, by the artist and antiquary George Vertue. Vertue displayed to Deborah an alleged image of her father-now usually taken to be the so-called "Princeton," or "Crayon," portrait, which is in turn either a copy or the original 15.

That is the picture of my father: how came you by it?' and stroaking the hair of her forehead, added, 'Just so my father wore his hair.' This daughter resembled Milton greatly."22 Blackbumrne's is only one of three surviving accounts of this meeting, and is in fact the least reliable of the three, as well as being the only one to make mention of Milton's hair; so one shouldn't read too much significance into it. But even so, it reflects the fact that by the late eigh- teenth century, at least, the poet's hairstyle could be seen as distinctive. And in fact one of the distinctive things about the hairstyle in question is the atten- tion it draws to the wearer's forehead. Unlike the cortafrangetta, for instance, or the bangs worn by figures like "William Prynne, John Lilburne, and the Earl of Strafford,"23 Mil- ton's parted forelock is designed to frame the forehead so as to render it more promi- nent-to endow the wearer with a "large Front" after the manner of Adam. As for the fairness of Adam's "Front," we encounter that detail, too, in physical descriptions of the mature Milton. In his own account of the visit to Deborah Clark, George Vertue records 21.

So we are left with a description of Adam that seems to parallel what we know of Milton's own personal appearance as manifest in a variety of details: a distinctive hair- style, a prominent forehead, a fair complexion and light brown hair. As Samuel Johnson remarked long before Roland Frye revisited the fact, Milton's "hair . . . was of a light brown, parted at the fore-top, and hung down upon his shoulders, according to the pic- ture which he has given of Adam."26 Perhaps it is no miracle to discover a writer model- ing his protagonist's physical constitution upon his own, but if the protagonist in ques- tion is the "prime of men" (5.563), himself created in the image and likeness of God the Father, such correspondence creates unexpected semiotic possibilities. II. These possibilities are suggested by one more bit of detail from Milton's introductory portrayal of Adam: the "Hyacinthin locks" that "Down from his parted forelock manly hung,/Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad." On one level, these lines add fur- ther support to the notion that Milton drew Adam in his own physical likeness; at any rate, Adam's shoulder-length hair accords well with the length of the poet's own hair as displayed in the Faithorne engraving and related depictions. But then there is the matter of Adam's manly, clustering, and, most peculiarly, hyacinthine locks. How does one make sense of them? Thomas Corns summarizes the standard gloss on "hyacinthine" when he maintains that "the 'hyacinthine locks' of Adam [are] an echo of Odysseus', likened by Homer to a hyacinth, and a neat marker by which Milton lightly links his epic to a classical model through a community of heroic attributes."27 For its part, the Homeric passage in ques- tion derives from Book 6 of The Odyssey, in which the princess Nausicaa discovers Odysseus, naked and shipwrecked, on the island of Corcyra. Odysseus implores Nausi- caa and her handmaidens for help; they in turn lend him clothing and allow him to bathe before leading him to the palace of Alcinous, Nausicaa's father. Homer describes the re- sulting ablutions as follows: CJuTrp 0 K aTOTQ(Ou XPo0a VIaETO ioS 'O&amp;SucaEUS cXIir)v, "i o vcO3Ta Kal EupE~~ daIJTTEXEV Co1jOUS, 2K KEa(S as 6' EOMlrlXEV O10S Xv6ov aTpUyETOIO. 24.

With water from the river the noble Odysseus washed from his skin the brine which covered his back and broad shoulders, and from his head he wiped the scurf of the barren sea. But when he had washed his whole body and anointed himself with oil, and had put on him the clothes which the unwed maiden had given him, then Athene, the daughter of Zeus, made him taller to look upon and stronger, and from his head she made the locks to flow in curls like the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold, a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athene have taught all kinds of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace upon his head and shoulders.28 Most commentary on this passage has focused upon the adjectives oiAos and vaKivOVOS, which function as mutual intensifiers. The former refers primarily to "thick, fleecy wool," from which it derives the secondary meaning of "crisp, close-curling."29 In keeping with this sense, the latter adjective is generally construed as a marker "of form and texture," alluding to "the curling of the petals" of the hyacinth-flower.3" Such glosses yield an Odysseus whose hair is among his heroic attributes, distinguishing him, it is conjectured, through "highly stylized spiral curls framing the brow and falling below the shoulder" in a manner exemplified by "Archaic kouroi of the seventh century [ec]."3T George Chapman clearly had some such understanding in mind when he rendered the Homeric lines as follows: "His [Odysseus'] locks (clensd) curld the more; and matcht (in power/To please an eye) the Hyacinthian flower."32 Patrick Hume's early Annotations on Milton's Paradise Lost applied this reading of Homer to Milton's description of Adam, de- claring that Adam's "dark brown Hair hung parted from his Forehead, curling round, Manly and Majestick."33 And a century after Chapman, Pope would revisit his transla- tion of the Homeric passage in question, this time with a nod to Milton's use of the ad- 28.

There is a secondary line of interpretation, too, in which 6aKivetvos is taken as a marker of color, but this reading yields no clear critical consensus. While on one hand, "the tcKIv~8o ... was perceived as dark," Odysseus' own hair is described as SavO6s- i.e., golden-at Odyssey 13.399 and 431; to make matters even murkier, his beard is else- where (16.176) described as KUaVEOS, or blue-black.35 Suidas' Lexicon defines UaKlVWlVOV as "uTojEXaAviSov"-i.e., dark brown--or "ropaupiov"-reddish-purple; Henri Esti- enne's Thesaurus Graecae Linguae follows suit with "purpureus ... ad nigrum vergens."36 Moreover, the jc~KlaV0oS also lent its name to a range of blue-colored precious and semi- precious stones, most particularly the sapphire.37 As a result, the color implied by Homer's JaKivOIvoS-if a color is implied at all-remains indeterminate. Like its English derivative, the adjective is rare in ancient Greek; apart from Homer's use of it, it occurs most prominently in Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis and Theocritus' eleventh idyll, in both of which cases it appears in the construction 1cxKivOlvov vi0os-literally "hyacinthine blossom"-referring to the flower itself.38 As far as I am aware, Homer's is the only sur- viving usage of the term to refer to hair. In sum, this is what scholars have said about the Homeric passage from which Mil- ton draws his reference to Adam's "Hyacinthin locks." It is also what scholars have said about Milton's reference. But as valuable as the preceding insights are, one cannot really apply them in unmodified form to Paradise Lost, for at least two reasons. First, Paradise Lost is not a work of ancient Greek literature. Second, to account for Milton's literary al- lusion simply by providing a gloss on its source is to ignore the character of the allusion as such-to ignore, that is, its motivation and consequences as an act of literary reference. The former of these points is well illustrated by the complexity of the Homeric gloss itself, which would be unnecessary if Homer's language were perspicuous. For classical audiences, the adjective caKivOIvoS may have carried unmistakable meaning as a de- scriptor of the human body (although even this is not certain), but by Milton's day it was less a term of pictorial characterization than of literary reference. As a result, Milton's "Hyacinthin" contrasts sharply with the more precise visual details of Adam's descrip- tion: the fair complexion, the shoulder-length hair, the parted forelock. In essence, the information conveyed by the Miltonic "Hyacinthin" has little to do with hairstyles and much more to do with literary connectedness; Milton's word-choice is first and foremost an act of textual juxtaposition. 34.

In fact, it is something rather different: a reference that encompasses a history of reception and a narrative context in excess of any line-by- line Homeric exegesis. Ignoring this fact leads to an impoverished sense of the motives governing Milton's rhetoric; at most, one ends up maintaining, like Corns, that Milton's "Hyacinthin" is "a neat marker by which Milton lightly links his epic to a classical model." In this account, there is no reason why the linkage should occur as it does, where it does, and there is no purpose to the linkage other than the linkage itself; the only noticeable consequence of the linkage might be a footnote in some edition of Paradise Lost. But if we consider the phrase in its broader context, broader interpretive possibilities emerge. First, for instance, we might consider the very literariness of the phrase "Hy- acinthin locks," and the way in which this quality forces a contrast between that phrase and other nearby physical descriptors: "parted forelock," "fair large Front," etc. To im- port the language of linear perspective into the business of literary analysis, we could say that Adam's hyacinthine locks mark the vanishing-point of Milton's descriptive se- quence: the moment at which the project of generating a visual image yields to that of marking a linguistic relation, the point at which sight gives way to understanding. As it happens, the relation between sight and understanding has fascinated Milton- ists for centuries. From Samuel Johnson's charge that Milton "saw nature... through the spectacles of books," through T. S. Eliot's complaint that "Milton may be said never to have seen anything," to Stanley Fish's argument that Paradise Lost teaches readers to "distrust [their] own abilities and perceptions," classic Milton criticism has repeatedly explored the nature of the poet's visual imagination and its relevance to his literary project.39 Given Milton's blindness, such explorations acquire a kind of tragic inevitability, often leading to pronouncements about the "sensuous poverty" of his verse and his own lack of interest in "having us see its particulars."40 But in the case of Adam's hyacinthine locks, one might more accurately maintain that the poet dramatizes the disconnect be- tween visual and linguistic modes of experience, privileging the latter over the former in a fashion made predictable by his choice of medium itself. In his general overview of the "family of images," W. J. T. Mitchell posits a structur- ing opposition between ideas of the image as "a graphic, pictorial representation, a con- crete, material object," and "notions such as mental, verbal, or perceptual imagery."41 When it moves from visual description to literary allusion, Milton's portrayal of Adam abandons the former category of images for the latter; more importantly, perhaps, it also rehearses the opposition between likeness and image with which this essay started, the opposition potentially present in God's own declaration, at Genesis 1.26, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." It is as if "Hyacinthin" were to "Eye sublime" and "parted forelock" as signified were to signifier; one returns to the original expressive re- 39. Johnson 1.105; T. S.

So Adam is made in the invisible image of God, but his physical constitution be- speaks the presence of that image, while also replicating Milton's own features, which in turn dissolve into an allusion to the hyacinthine locks of Homer's Odysseus. That is the chain of association we have pursued to this point, and whatever its irregularities, it has at least adhered to a consistent sense of the body as signifier, a sense in which, as Stephen Orgel has put it, the work itself, spiritual or linguistic, remains "a platonic idea, only im- perfectly represented by its text."42 But what do we do when, as here, the text in question gestures toward two separate and apparently incompatible ideas? How do we reconcile a Christian spirituality with a classical literary ethos? The theory of euhemerism has offered one traditional model for working through this dilemma, and in the present case it might suggest an assimilation of classical myth to the body of scriptural revelation. This logic derives from what Jean Seznec has called the "demonic" variant of euhemerist thought, which assumes on the basis of Psalm 96.5 that "All the gods of the nations are idols" and that scripture provides, among other things, a corrective account of pagan religious practice.43 Developing out of early patristic attacks on classical worship in which the gods and goddesses of antiquity are described as daemonia,44 this line of discourse reappears triumphantly in Paradise Lost, whose fallen angels migrate to earth and install themselves there as "Deities" (1.323), singing, to them- selves and whoever else will listen, a "partial" (2.552) account of "their own Heroic deeds" (2.549). From the standpoint of such belief, editors of Milton have found it irresistible to see, in the references to "Man" with which Paradise Lost begins (1.1-4), a competitive allusion to the "man of many devices" ( iv6pa. ... TrOA TpoTrov; 1.1) of the Odyssey.45 This allusive environment, in turn, supports a similar allusion to Odysseus in the description of Adam's hyacinthine locks: an allusion that juxtaposes Homer's TroAiTpoTros (literally "many- troped," "wily," with a quibble on "much-traveled") hero and Milton's original man. When we recall, in addition, that the adjective acxKiv0vos applies to Odysseus' hair as it is sub- ject to rejuvenation under the beneficent influence of his patroness Athena, goddess of wisdom, and note that the English parallel to tiaKivelvoS occurs in Paradise Lost to mark the first appearance of Adam, adorned with "Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure," the euhemerist potential of Milton's "Hyacinthin" becomes fully apparent. The adjective effects a typical Miltonic reversal of influence such that unfallen Adam emerges as the historical original of Homer's Odysseus: the archetypal wise epic hero of whom Odysseus himself is a demonically-inspired derivative. 42.

The result might be characterized as an elaborate private joke on the part of Milton himself, who emerges from this catenation as the iconographic original not only of his own Adam but of Homer's Odysseus, too. After all, if Adam is made to look like Milton, and Odysseus is made in the image of Adam, Odysseus, too, must be made in the image of Milton, albeit at a greater imitative remove. IIL In the preceding analysis, Adam's physique is to his inward gifts of mind and spirit as Milton's classical sources are to his scriptural source; in each of these pairings, the latter term relates to the former as does image to likeness. But in each of the two cases, as well, the relationship between image and likeness is guaranteed by the presence of a super- vening third term; as the text of Paradise Lost anchors the relation between scriptural orig- inal and classical imitation, so Milton's own physical features ground a chain of bodily resemblance that extends from the divine image to the iconography of classical heroism. But what if the poet's physicality gestures, in turn, toward its own invisible double? This possibility leads to a final term in the analytical sequence rehearsed above. In general, scholars have shied away from the obvious mythic resonances of an ad- jective like "Hyacinthin," preferring instead to focus on the word's pictorial capacities. Of the glosses on "Hyacinthin" offered by Roy Flannagan, Merritt Hughes, Alastair Fowler, John Leonard, and Scott Elledge, only those of Flannagan and Fowler even mention the myth of Hyacinthus, and they do so only in general terms, suggesting some possible ref- erence to "the youth beloved by Apollo" yet nonetheless "doomed to die."46 But if the principal (or even a principal) function of Milton's word-choice here is to convey literary associations, then we would be remiss to overlook this one. At the very least, we must grant that the Hyacinthus-myth elicited Milton's attention in poems other than Paradise Lost, as in "Lycidas'" reference to "that sanguine flower inscrib'd with woe" (106) and the allusion to "young Hyacinth born on Eurotas strand" in "On the Death of a Fair Infant." Moreover, the conjunction of divine love and death in the Hyacinthus tale invites comparisons to the fall of Adam. But surprisingly enough, early mythographers don't make much of this fact. In general, the most one can say is that they acknowledge it im- plicitly. Ovid's account of Apollo and Hyacinthus appears in Book 10 of the Metamor- phoses, immediately following the tale of Jupiter and Ganymede.47 This latter myth, in turn, was often construed as an allegory of spiritual love. Pierre Bersuire (1290-1362), for instance, adduces two possible readings of it, in which, alternatively, "The eagle [that Jupiter transforms himself into in order to ravish Ganymede] signifies purity just as Ganymede signifies John the Evangelist, young and beloved .... Or the eagle is Christ, who loved this boy and lifted him up to heavenly secrets" ("Ista aquila significat limpi- tudinem sicut ganimedes significat iohannem euangelistam iuuenem &amp; gratiosum . . .

As George Sandys (1578-1664) put it in the commentary on his transla- tion of Ovid, "As Iupiter Ganimed, so had Apollo advanced his beloued Hyacinthus, had hee not beene prevented by the death, which he unfortunately gaue him."" Natale Conti (1520- 1582), for one, describes Apollo's accidental killing of Hyacinthus as "imprudens" ("Hy- acinthum imprudens occidit")-a word that conflates the notions of inadvertency and folly.5' And Marco Antonio Tritonio's (1541-1572) Mythologia also adopts this view, listing Hy- acinthus in a series of Ovidian characters--e.g. Midas, Phaethon, Icarus, Actaeon-who exemplify "imprudentia."s2 Vexingly, it is not at all clear whom Conti and Tritonio hold accountable for the "imprudentia" in question, and this uncertainty could hold implications for any Miltonic allusion to the Hyacinthus-myth in Paradise Lost. Conti clearly attributes some (if not necessarily all) of the myth's folly to Apollo; Tritonio, on the other hand, describes Hy- acinthus himself as "disco minus prudenter ludens."53 But in any case, this is a slender reed upon which to rest the argument that Milton gives Adam hyacinthine hair in order to evoke an allegorized version of Ovidian myth in which Hyacinthus' death serves as a type of original sin. The whole sequence of reasoning is too flimsy, and too lacking in mythographic precedent, to seem persuasive. On the other hand, there is a second mythographic tradition that makes far better sense in the context of Paradise Lost 4, in part because it is much simpler: the tradition that Hyacinthus serves as an exemplar of youthful male beauty, a mythic archetype of the pretty boy.4 Tritonio, for instance, includes Hyacinthus in two of his moralized lists of Ovidian exempla: the one in which he appears among the "imprudentes," and then a sec- ond, in which he figures among the "formosi"-Adonis, Ganymede, Hippolytus, etc.-by virtue of his "ingenuam pulchritudinem."55 In like fashion, Sandys describes Hyacinthus as 48.

In my survey of commentary on Paradise Lost 4.301, only Edward Le Comte has noted this pos- sibility, remarking that "hyacinthine" may mean, "perhaps, as beautiful as HYACINTH, whom APOLLO loved" (Le C., A Milton Dictionary [New York: Philosophical Library, 1961], 152). 55. Tritonio, 22.</page><page sequence="14">210 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2006 "repleat with beauty," beloved by Apollo "for his beauty," which "exciteth the mind to a selfe contemplation: whereby at length putting off the affections and fervor of youth, by his owne vigour it produceth the flower of knowledge and wisdome."56 This view of the Hyacinthus-myth de- liberately follows the logic also embodied in moralizing interpretations of the Ganymede- story; as Sandys goes on to say of Hyacinthus, "The Poets, shaddowing under their fables Philosophicall and Theologicall instructions, by the love of the Gods unto boyes expresse the graciousnesse of simplicity and innocency: and like little children, or not at all, must we ascend the celestiall habitations."57 But this particular view of the myth, unlike readings that em- phasize the "imprudentia" of Hyacinthus and Apollo, concentrates on what the young boy gets right: his beauty, which offers a visible marker of spiritual capacities, a likeness, as it were, of the heavenly image within. Insofar as Adam's hyacinthine hair makes reference, deliberate or inadvertent, to the myth of Hyacinthus, it most likely does so in this particular spirit. And this probability is still further enhanced by the fact that, for later readers, the Odyssey's "uaKivOtvov dvoeos" encourages the very same mythic connection. Whatever else he may be, Homer's Odysseus is no archetype of "imprudentia." On the contrary, the whole point of his hy- acinthine curls is obviously that they make him beautiful-a point of considerable mo- ment given his situation in Book 6 of Homer's poem. Here, nearing the end of his home- ward journey, Odysseus finds himself exhausted and alone, utterly without resources, confronting a group of frightened maidens on an alien shore. To obtain the aid he needs, he must perform an act of supplication that nullifies the uncouth and threatening aspects of his appearance, thereby easing his way into a strange society. In the event, his method for doing so "takes on the faintest tincture of the erotic";58 it aims to be civilized without being smarmy, courtly without being lewd. Homer clearly frames the encounter with Nausicaa to this end; before she meets Odysseus, she has already received a visit from Athena, who has prophesied that she "shall not long remain a maiden" (oiTol ETI 61v 1ap0~vos EOoEal [6.33]), and when Odysseus first appears to her it is in a nicely-calcu- lated 'cheesecake pose,' emerging from the undergrowth with a leafy branch in his hand, "that he might hold it about him and thereby hide his genitals" (c&amp;o ~poaIrTo rsp XPOI ila a C4cTo6s [6.129]). In this context, his hyacinthine locks perform the overdetermined function of making him, if possible, even more sexually attractive, comparable-at least from the standpoint of a seventeenth-century readership-to Apollo's own beloved boy.59 In this sense, Homer's Odyssey may return us, through the figure of its hero, to that of Hyacinthus, and in this sense, Milton's reference to Homer can be said to incorporate allusion to the Hyacinthus myth as well. For both Homer and Milton, the reference to hy- acinthine locks signifies masculine erotic appeal within a context involving masculine nudity. Writing of Adam's appearance in Paradise Lost 4, Alastair Fowler remarks that "the elaborateness of the present passage lends some support to the theory that M[ilton] 56.

It is less probable that Homer's c(lKivOIvov &amp;vOos alludes to the Hyacinthus-myth. As Laurence and Franlois Villard have noted, surviving literary references to the myth appear no earlier than Hesiod, and while the cult of Hyacinthus may be "d'origine... prdhellinique" (546), its as- sociation with pederastic love appears to be of much later date (Laurence and Francois Villard, "Hyakinthos," Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae, ed. Hans Christoph Ackermann and Jean-Robert Gisler, 8 vols. in 16 [Zurich: Artemis, 1981-97], 5.1.546-550). What later read- ers may make of Homer's phrase is, of course, a wholly different matter.</page><page sequence="15">Boehrer 211 had a special sexual interest in hair"; one could also propose that the passage's allusive texture lends this theory additional support.60s Moreover, this same pattern of erotic reso- nance holds even further relevance for Milton's subject-matter if we consider Homer's Odysseus, arising from the sea, as an emblem of originary man. Emerging naked from the depths after an ordeal of loss and almost certain death, Odysseus tropes his own re- birth in his erotic self-presentation to Nausicaa. Stella Revard has recently argued that Paradise Lost draws on Homeric precedent not only in its treatment of "battle carnage" and related martial matter, but also in its depiction of "interpersonal relationships"; here, in Milton's recollection of Odysseus' hyacinthine locks, we encounter a case in point.61 But if this compound reference helps to depict "interpersonal relationships," just what kinds of relationships does it help to depict? In Milton, we witness a strange trans- formation of mythic subject-matter whereby a figure that originally embodies the beauty of the ipapavoS in a tale of homoerotic love comes later to embody heteroerotic and, eventually, married heteronormative masculine appeal. The effect is downright bizarre: beneath the external appearance of an idealized bond between husband and wife, one encounters the pattern of a prevenient man-boy liaison, a relationship that stands to the former as does invisible image to visible likeness. Might this invisible image serve as a sexualized counterpart-a kind of ghost- effigy--of the Miltonic self-portrait we can recognize in Adam's parted forelock and fair complexion? John Shawcross has advanced a psychobiographical account of Milton's re- lationship with Charles Diodati in which Diodati figures as "a dominant counterpart to Milton" during the friends' Cambridge years, and in which Diodati's "rough personality outlines" suggest "a rather promiscuous homosexuality" in contrast to Milton's own "religious and ideological repressions..., high-mindedness, and 'female' qualities of ap- pearance, interests, and abilities."62 One needn't accede to all the details of this account, nor must one even assume that Milton and Diodati actually had a sexual affair, in order to conclude that theirs was a passionate relationship whose character admitted of erotic formulation. This much is reflected in the surviving textual record itself, from the friends' correspondence through the "Orgia" that are "celebrated in the manner of Bacchus" ("bacchantur") at the end of the "Epitaphium Damonis" (219). Given this record, it only makes sense that the poet's later figurations of erotic bliss should derive in some measure from his earlier rhetoric of friendship. Indeed, Milton's lines themselves would appear on one level to respond to their own homoerotic resonance. That is arguably the point of the adjective "manly" in the lines "Hyacinthin locks/Down from his parted forelock manly hung": registering the ambiguities-whether of gender or age class-associated with the junior role in a man- boy relationship, this adjective works as reaction-formation, insisting upon the very mas- culinity that the hyacinthine reference destabilizes.63 Small wonder, then, that Patrick 60.

Recent commentators on the history of homosexuality have adopted very different views of the historical association between same-sex love and effeminacy, with Randolph Trumbach, for one, arguing that "whenever homosexual behavior surfaced at the [English] royal courts, from the twelfth to the early seventeenth centuries, it was accompanied by what contempo- raries viewed as markedly effeminate behavior" ("London's Sodomites: Homosexual Behavior and Western Culture in the Eighteenth Century," Journal of Social History 11 [Winter, 1977], 11)</page><page sequence="16">212 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / Fall 2006 Hume's early annotations on Paradise Lost should preserve the original adjective and, if anything, raise its testosterone level further by translating Milton's "manly" into "Manly and Majestick." There is, apparently, a need for such clarification. Yet at the same time, the reference to Hyacinthus proves useful precisely because it pulls against the traditional physical markers of full masculinity. After all, Milton's Adam is given no beard, and while commentators regard this beardlessness as a debt to conventions of sacred iconography which, ironically, derive the image of Adam from classical representations of Apollo, the allusion to Hyacinthus proves without doubt con- venient in a context depicting beardless male beauty.TM Sandys, for one, remarks that the hyacinth flower "flourisheth in the end of March and beginning ofAprill: which not only pre- senteth the season and beauty of youth; but keepes the haire from sprouting on the chin, if an- noynted with the oyle thereof."65 And for those inclined to detect a measure of authorial amour propre in Milton's physical description of Adam, it is worth recalling that Milton himself, the former "Lady of Christ's," never wore a beard. What the Lady in A Mask Pre- sented at Ludlow-Castle says of her brothers, one could say of Milton's Adam and the boy Hyacinthus as well: "As smooth as Hebe's their unrazor'd lips" (290). As for the mature Milton, while his own lips could scarcely have been "unrazor'd," they, too, were equally smooth. IV. So here is the full chain of association this essay has explored: Adam and Eve attest, through their physical constitution, to their status as bearers of the invisible image of God, yet Adam's physicality likewise bears the imprint of his earthly author, Milton him- self, while also (and appropriately for a character created by a classicist of Milton's stature) encompassing a reference to Homer that effects a euhemerist subordination of classical texts and spirituality to the Christian inspiration of Paradise Lost yet nonetheless gestures, through an embedded secondary reference to the myth of Hyacinthus, toward a model of masculine beauty and male-male intimacy with personal resonances for Mil- ton's life and work. This is admittedly an intricate sequence of connections, but then, Par- adise Lost is nothing if not an intricate poem. And while this essay has ended up in the ter- rain of queer studies, it makes no effort to identify Milton as a queer author-whatever that might mean for a poet of his place and time. It simply registers the poet's manifest at- tachment to his closest male friend while considering the implications of a particular mythic reference in Paradise Lost. Indeed, if there is any sexual moral to the story this essay tells, it is not that Milton's erotic imaginary conforms to an anachronistic distinc- tion between heterosexuality and homosexuality, but that the marital heteronormativity of his later work is indebted to his understanding of male-male intimacy. and Alan Bray replying that effeminacy was "associated with luxurious living and sexual vice in general" (Homosexuality in Renaissance England [London: Gay Men's Press, 1982; rpt. New York: Columbia University Press, 1995], 135). In the present instance, however, we are dealing with the more specific case of the child's role in a man-boy relationship-a role whose gender ambiguities are arguably sui generis. 64. For the debt to sacred iconography, see Fowler 213, n. iv.303, who in turn cites Cartari and Panofsky to support the point. 65. Sandys, 359 (italics as in Sandys).</page><page sequence="17">Boehrer 213 Of course, a reader may grant my more immediate claims-that Milton's initial depiction of prelapsarian, heteronormative, married bliss carries within it the ghost- image of a male-male relationship, and that this relationship finds a counterpart in Milton's own literary and emotional development-without therefore accepting that male-male intimacy sets the terms for Milton's understanding of wedded love. But whatever else it may be, the gender-confusion of Milton's hyacinthine reference is not unique. On the contrary, Milton's work is often preoccupied with such matters. Al- most as much as for Shakespeare, transgender dynamics provide a signature motif for Milton. There is, for instance, the Mask Presented at Ludlow-Castle, which sets itself to rewrite the tale of Circe from Book 10 of The Odyssey while reversing the gender of protagonist and antagonist-a masque that, in addition to this broad reconfiguration of its source- text, sports with gender instabilities on any number of more limited occasions ("As smooth as Hebe's their unrazor'd lips"). There are the companion-elegies, "Lycidas" and the "Epitaphium Damonis," both of which conclude with transcendent nuptial-celebra- tions in which their respective male subjects seem to occupy the place of the bride.66 There is Paradise Regained, in which Satan tempts Jesus with, among other things, a vi- sion of "Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew/Then Ganymed or Hylas" (2.352- 53)-youths whose presence instills into the temptation scene "a homoerotic component discordant with typical commentaries."67 And then there is Paradise Lost, a poem riddled with intimations of same-sex dal- liance and gender reversal. The most impressive critical testimony to this aspect of the epic may still come from C. S. Lewis, who fretted famously over "'the amorous propensi- ties' of Milton's angels": The trouble is, I think, that since these exalted creatures are all spoken of by masculine pronouns, we tend, half consciously, to think that Milton is attribut- ing to them a life of homosexual promiscuity...; but the real meaning is cer- tainly not filthy, and certainly not foolish. As angels do not die, they need not breed. They are not therefore sexed in the human sense at all."8 Lewis's concern about the homoerotic component of Paradise Lost is particularly com- pelling, not only because of his acknowledged status as a literary scholar but also because of his genteel homophobia, which renders him uncomfortable with the idea of angelic homosexuality and eager to make it go away. Yet even Lewis recognizes it as an undercurrent of the poem, and more recent scholars, following Gregory Bredbeck, have charted this undercurrent less squeamishly.69 Even critics not properly concerned with the homoeroticism of Paradise Lost end up registering its transgender and queer 66.

Eve takes the place of the beloved com- panion that Achilles loses; she effects the resolution of the epic by assuming the role that Priam had played in the Iliad.70 In the face of such collective testimony, it is hard not to admit the importance of homo- erotic and transgender thematics for a study of Paradise Lost, and it is hard not to suspect that these thematics have some bearing on the poet's broader understanding of love and sex. As Claude Summers has observed, the textual record "suggest[s] both Milton's deep familiarity with the classical literature of homosexuality and his capacity for discovering in it emotions correlative to his own."71 My own reluctance to specify the nature of Milton's debt to homoerotic love in his depiction of prelapsarian marriage may strike readers as coy. In response-while still maintaining that the available psychobiographical evidence makes it impossible to settle the exact character of Milton's relationship to Diodati in particular and to male-male inti- macy in general-I can offer two final observations. First, the Graeco-Roman homoerotic tradition offered Milton a very specific model of emotional closeness that arguably spoke to certain deficiencies of early modern European marriage practice. To take only the most obvious of sources here, it is a long way from Montaigne's remark that la suffisance ordinaire des femmes n'est pas pour respondre i cette conference &amp; com- munication, nourrisse de cette saincte couture; ny leur ame ne semble assezferme pour soustenir l'estreinte d'vn neud si pressa &amp; si durable the ordinary capacity of women is inadequate for that communion and fellow- ship which is the nurse of this sacred bond [of friendship]; nor does their soul seem firm enough to endure the strain of so tight and durable a knot?2 to Adam's insistence that in asking for a mate he seeks "fellowship ... /. .. fit to partici- pate/All rational delight" (Paradise Lost 390-392). Notwithstanding Montaigne's own famous revulsion from "that other, licentious Greek love,"73 models of classical same-sex intimacy arguably offer Milton a paradigm for the affective satisfactions of idealized companionate marriage.74 And in doing so, they also provide a paradigm of union with the divine that bears on the poet's declared marital ideals. 70.

On this view, sexual union in wedlock becomes a mere signifier-a physical likeness, as it were-of a supervening spiritual relation; as Milton himself put it, "the dig- nity &amp; blessing of marriage is plac't rather in the mutual enjoyment of that which the wanting soul needfully seeks, then of that which the plenteous body would joyfully give away" (940). Here, influentially for the seventeenth-century reformed tradition, one en- counters a vision of wedlock as first and foremost a spiritual rather than a carnal union: a relationship whose privileged indicia were emotional fulfillment, personal intimacy, and consummation of the soul's desire for unity with others. As it happens, the early modern interpretative tradition surrounding the Ganymede-myth helped to model just this kind of ecstasy. It invested the myth, in James M. Saslow's words, with the Neoplatonic "sense of rapture, of intense physical delight in the presence of one's beloved, as the closest earthly analogue to the exaltation of experiencing divine love."75 As for the myth of Hy- acinthus, George Sandys was surely not the only seventeenth-century reader to see par- allels between it and the story of Ganymede; in their parallel forms, these tales arguably provide Milton with a pattern of sexuality as union with the divine, and in doing so they arguably offer a bridge from the discourse of classical homoeroticism to that of Miltonic marriage. But beyond this, one may perhaps locate an additional erotic investment in Milton's portrait of Adam. Here I revisit my earlier observation that Adam's appearance is cast in the mold of Homer's Odysseus while simultaneously recalling that of Milton himself. On one level, as I have already suggested (above, pp. 207-208), these associations recast the Homeric hero as a belated imitation of Milton's Adamic original. But at the same time, such resonances suggest that in their idealized sexual attractiveness, both Odysseus and Adam may be read as physical simulacra of the poet himself, who thus emerges as the originary figure of sexually desirable masculinity not only within his own epic, but within the broader western literary tradition whose development Paradise Lost purports to explain. On this logic, the hyacinthine image behind Milton's first man turns out to be that of the poet himself, the Lady of Christ's, and Paradise Lost's archetype of masculine beauty may be understood-perhaps disappointingly, perhaps ironically-as an expres- sion of authorial self-attraction. At the very least, this possibility adds a peculiar valence to Eve's discovery that "beauty is excelld by manly grace" (4.490), while also suggesting that the very process of literary composition and imitation through which Paradise Lost emerges into being may on some level be a function of homoerotic, and indeed auto- erotic, identifications. The notion of literary imitation brings us back to Milton's relationship to Homer, and in doing so, it brings this essay to a good resting-place. For at heart this study has ex- plored Milton's use of Homer in a single, highly localized instance, and my broad claim here-that Milton's vision of prelapsarian companionate marriage is informed by the ideals and language of classical homoerotic companionship-is in fact a special case of the general argument, put forth long ago by Francis Blessington, that "Paradise Lost is... 75.

It should surprise no one that Milton often treats this practice with the same condemnation that he displays toward many other products of classical civilization. The real irony is that, such condemnation notwith- standing, the practice should still remain visible behind Milton's poetic image of ideal sexuality-and of himself-in Paradise Lost.</page></plain_text>
