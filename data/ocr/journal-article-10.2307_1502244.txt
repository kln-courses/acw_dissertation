The Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status entail considerable conceptual demands for many primary trainees. Generating meaningful causal explanations of scientific phenomena lies at the heart of both the scientific endeavour itself, and of effective classroom teaching. To focus on knowledge acquisition per se in teacher education, however, obscures the critical issue of subject-related pedagogical knowledge that ultimately influences classroom practice. This article explores the development of both subject knowledge and subject-related pedagogical knowledge in science education. It is informed by science education literature, as well as by a substantial body of empirical research into trainees' learning of aspects of physical science accumulated over a five-year period. Learners' perspectives of the synthesis of subject and pedagogy raise important questions concerning the nature of teacher education. Introduction In the recent special edition of BERJ (2002) concerning research on subject knowledge and its application, the editorial by Leach, Williams and Andrews identified a range of reasons why British educational researchers should address themselves to research agendas relating to subject knowledge. Not least of these is that the teaching and learning of subject knowledge is a fundamental aim of schooling in the formal sector, and lies at the core of continued national debate on improving standards in education. The articles contained within the issue demon- strated clearly how subject-specific research (in mathematics and science), usually reported in subject-specific domains, can illuminate themes pertinent to didactics and pedagogy that can be applied across disciplines. The editorial questioned the extent to which research on subject matter and its application, currently being conducted within particular subject communities in different subject areas, produc- tively interact with each other. The following discussion is an attempt to explore *Institute of Education, Manchester Metropolitan University, 799 Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 2RR, UK.

Parker how some generic issues arising from recent research in the field of teacher science education may have a wider significance in teacher education. Primary teacher education has formed a focal point for exploring the development of trainees' science subject knowledge. In response to National Curriculum de- mands in terms of subject knowledge, the Department for Education and Employ- ment (DfEE) published Circular 4/98 (DfEE, 1998) stipulating that subject knowledge and understanding to be acquired by primary trainees such that they are confident and competent in using the science specified. In 2002 the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) supplanted Circular 4/98 with the Professional Standards for Qualified Teacher Status for initial teacher training (Department for Education and Skills [DfES], 2002). The science subject knowledge component for primary trainees is no longer stated explicitly. Rather, implicit within the standards for achieving qualified teacher status (QTS) is an in-depth and subtle knowledge of the subject, which it is claimed will result in confident and competent practitioners who are able to promote effectively children's learning in the primary classroom: Central to all teachers' work is the need to help pupils develop their knowledge and understanding of the subjects they study. To do this confidently and effectively teachers need a high level of subject knowledge and understanding relevant to the pupils' curriculum. Secure subject knowledge enables teachers to judge how ideas and con- cepts can be broken down and sequenced logically so they can support pupils' learning. (TTA, 2002; p. 18) This places considerable learning demand upon primary trainees, many of whom lack both breadth and depth in terms of their own science education. Not only are few primary trainees science specialists, but they often have limited science experi- ence and may also possess negative views of science teaching and learning upon entry to courses (Gustafson &amp; Rowell, 1995; Parker &amp; Spink, 1997; Tosun, 2000). The question therefore arises as to how best to support trainees in the development of not only subject knowledge, but also knowledge and understanding of the teaching and learning of science. The translation of professional knowledge into classroom practice requires the synthesis of these two elements, and the following discussion attempts to add to current debate concerning subject knowledge and pedagogy. Background to the empirical studies The aim here is to draw on the findings so as to explore some common themes that may have wider significance for teacher education. The studies referred to are focused on the learning of relatively large numbers of undergraduate and postgradu- ate trainees, including teachers continuing their professional development (sample sizes 50-90 learners). They constitute a significant amount of empirical data, drawing on a substantial body of subject-specific research carried out across a range of physical science domains (Heywood &amp; Parker, 1997, 2001; Parker &amp; Heywood, 1998, 2000). The research sought to gain insight into how learners develop not only science subject knowledge, but also subject-related pedagogical knowledge as they participated in university-based taught sessions within the traditionally difficult</page><page sequence="3">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 821 conceptual areas of electricity, forces and basic astronomy. That these areas are problematic for learners is well known (Driver et al., 1994), possibly because they tend to contain scientific ideas that are at odds with common-sense thinking and everyday observation of the physical world. Internalization of such concepts often requires radical conceptual changes for trainees. For instance, forces and motion is one of the most challenging areas of study in science education; a multitude of research attests to its difficulty (Brown &amp; Clement, 1987; Kruger et al., 1990; Tao &amp; Gunstone, 2000). The problem lies in the fact that a scientific interpretation of force and motion involves development of an abstract conception that contrasts sharply with everyday life experience, such as the intuitive notion that heavy objects fall faster. Primary teachers will need to develop an understanding of balanced and unbal- anced forces in order to support children's learning within the current science curriculum. For example, in order to underpin effective teaching it is necessary to understand that when an object is stationary or moving at a constant speed in a straight line, then the forces acting on it are balanced, whereas unbalanced forces produce change in motion. The intuitive view that force is an 'entity' that belongs 'to' an object causing the object to cease moving when it 'runs out' is perpetuated through such experiences as pushing someone on a swing. That is, the harder one pushes, the longer it takes for the swing to stop because the force applied takes longer to 'run out'. This contrasts sharply with the scientific view of forces acting 'on' objects and requires of the learner a considerable degree of conceptual shift if it is to be fully internalized. Rationale and methodology of the empirical studies The studies sought to track trainees' learning as it evolved in situ during taught sessions. This was intended to: * identify learners' initial perspectives and determine how these were influenced through a range of teaching experiences; * explore learners' perspectives of their own learning and factors that were import- ant in influencing the process. The research approach was predicated on two powerful premises. Firstly, the intention was to engage trainees in critical scrutiny of their own developing subject and pedagogical understanding. Research on effective teaching over the past two decades supports the contention that successful practice is linked to inquiry, reflection and continuous professional growth (Carr, 1995; Elliott, 1987; Loughran, 2002). In general, within teacher education, there has been widespread subscription to Schan's (1983) notion of reflection-in-practice and reflection-on-practice as a means of supporting the professional development of trainees. The empirical studies accord with the process of individuals explicitly recognizing their own learning within the context of subject knowledge and pedagogy combined. Such a metacog- nitive approach, designed to illuminate the explicit relation of learning and teaching, serves to engender empathy with the condition of being a learner.</page><page sequence="4">822 J. Parker In reflecting on how one comes to an understanding of the cognitive demand within particular conceptual domains, the nature of the subject and the epistemolog- ical beliefs of learners are themselves brought into focus. Naive views of learning are often based on memorization (Fox, 2001), and critical reappraisal of this perception is needed if teacher education is to be effective. Lunn (2002) found that views of science expressed by teachers and those inferred from their classroom practice were largely consistent. This extends to a requirement on the teacher/trainee to confront their ideas, both implicit and explicit, about how one learns to teach, since this necessarily impacts on how the individual perceives appropriate participation in being taught or trained (Tomlinson, 1999b). Secondly, the approach was informed by another powerful premise that has constituted a significant influence on primary science education in latter decades: constructivism. Whilst the interpretation of the term constructivism is multifaceted (Philips, 2000) and the extent and usefulness to which constructivism can be considered a theory of learning, teaching or both has been questioned (Solomon, 1994; Fox, 2001), the research has served to raise teachers' awareness of the complex nature of developing conceptual understanding across a range of concep- tual domains in science. It is also likely that most primary science trainees will receive during their education explicit reference to so-called constructivist ap- proaches to learning and teaching science. These are widely promoted in primary science literature and tend to represent constructivism in terms of learners actively constructing their own understanding of the world as a result of their experiences and interactions (e.g. Harlen, 2000; Sharp et al., 2000). This results in a focus on children's ideas, with science teaching seeking ways to challenge thinking through scientific inquiry. Whilst the paradigm requires implicitly that teachers have knowl- edge of how learners' ideas emerge and are influenced, few research studies have focused on the teaching and learning process itself. In order to redress this issue, the empirical studies sought to capture learning as a dynamic as it evolved during sessions, shifting the research focus from pre/post 'snapshots' to 'strobe' pictures of the cognitive construction process (Dykstra, 1992). The studies attempted to explore the subtleties of learning in situ and required learners to engage with a range of teaching strategies and approaches during taught sessions, including: * group discussions/responses to phenomena/questions/investigations; * individual reflection; * written responses/interviews/recorded discussions; * annotated drawings to explain thinking; * providing opportunity for reflection at critical points during teaching; * developing and testing personal hypotheses; * responding to the range of ideas within the peer group, including established scientific explanations; * experiencing a range of investigative approaches from open-ended exploration to highly structured investigation;</page><page sequence="5">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 823 * being introduced to cognitive challenge where evidence directly contradicted expectation; * modelling ideas and observing demonstrations; * responding to challenging questions, including thought investigations. This formed the basis of the data collated. Such an approach is predicated on building an atmosphere of trust such that students feel able to share their thinking openly (in this discussion trainees are regarded as students or learners of both science and pedagogy and no attempt is made to differentiate the terms), and on the explicit recognition of the value of analysis of personal practice to provide motivation for learning. Learners' conceptions Exploration of learners' initial ideas about scientific concepts supported the wealth of research widely reported in science education literature. Although the intention is not to review this at length here, some critical features are worth restating. The empirical studies support the view that so-called alternative or naive views of scientific concepts are not uncommon and, indeed, those of adults are often not too different from those of children (Baxter, 1989; Driver et al., 1994; Kruger et al., 1990; Summers et al., 2000). For example, in the empirical study in basic astron- omy, the research data indicated that only 32% of the undergraduates questioned expressed a scientific view of how day and night occurs based on reasoning involving the Earth's spin on its axis every 24 hours. A surprisingly large number (61.3%) held alternative models such as the Earth maintaining a fixed position in space with the Sun and Moon orbiting the Earth once every 24 hours. Phenomena such as seasonal change and phases of the Moon proved even more problematic, where only 9.7% of undergraduate students displayed a scientific view of seasons. Initial conceptions may prove resistant and difficult to influence through teaching (Brown &amp; Clement, 1987; Steinberg, 1990). For example, the initial view of one student with respect to how day and night occur was: 'The moon blocks out the sun to give night-time'. Despite exploring the phenomenon through practical modelling, contemplating a range of explanations (including the scientific explanation) and observing a class demonstration, the student commented: 'I was really confident on the reasons for day and night so no explanations were needed, although we did do a quick demonstration.' Chi and Roscoe (2002) identify two types of naive knowledge; firstly 'preconcep- tions' that are readily revised through instruction and secondly, 'misconceptions' that persist even when the student learning experience is supported with teaching based on coherent structured explanation. They suggest that students' lack of awareness of their misunderstanding is instrumental in impeding conceptual change. Campanario (2002) contends that preconceptions resemble theories-in-action and are expressed mainly upon use. In misconceptions literature there is an almost implicit assumption that an individual's reasoning is clear to them personally. The empirical studies suggest that the process of becoming aware of underpinning</page><page sequence="6">824 J. Parker personal conceptions often takes a considerable amount of practical experience, discussion, and time to begin to articulate. Indeed, the data collated across the conceptual domains studied indicated that on many occasions students are not fully aware of their own conceptions, as exemplified in the following statement: 'I didn't really know why I thought some things would float, I just did. Thinking about why was really hard.' Thinking often needs to be oriented within the context in order to clarify sources of uncertainty: I now realise that I think the weight is important [after exploring floating and sinking] and I know it's not the only answer, like lots of other things (surface area, material, air etc.) are involved but I don't know how exactly. When asked to consider their reasoning, students often resorted to what they 'should know' or 'did know' from past science education: 'I do know this, I just can't remember it at the moment.' Thus, learners' conceptions and their adherence to them present teachers of physical science with a major challenge in terms of pedagogy. If trainees are to meet the standards required for QTS (DfES, 2002) then it is clear many will have to undergo substantial (if not radical) conceptual change. Not only that, but they will also need to develop pedagogical insight into how to address children's misconcep- tions in the classroom. A central aim of science education is to develop understand- ing of general principles that can be applied in making sense of new objects or events. This process begins with familiar phenomena in the immediate environment about which ideas are formed and then linked together, creating broader concepts with greater explanatory power (Harlen et al., 1995). Knowledge of the development of understanding within the various scientific domains and factors influencing the process of conceptual change therefore constitute a crucial element of teacher education. Conceptual change A critical research question, then, concerns how to facilitate conceptual change in pursuit of more effective instructional strategies. Research has contributed much to our knowledge and understanding of science learning in the past 25 years (Fensham, 2001; Jenkins, 2001). The perception of science learning as an active process of personal construction whereby knowledge, understanding and experience of the world are integrated with new ideas and experiences has predominated. In this paradigm it is the effectiveness of such integration and linking that determines the quality of learning. To such an end, research has focused on the search for a theoretical model of learning in an effort to identify factors influencing conceptual change in the quest for more effective instructional strategies (see, for instance; diSessa &amp; Sherrin, 1998; Tao &amp; Gunstone, 2000; Lim6n &amp; Mason, 2002). The focus on conceptual change, drawing on Piaget's ideas (1975), initiated in the early 1980s and later refined (see Hewson, 1981; Posner &amp; Strike, 1982), identifies two patterns of change: assimilation and accommodation. The former concerns the use of existing concepts to deal with new phenomena, whilst accommodation requires</page><page sequence="7">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 825 their radical reorganization or replacement. Such research tends to concentrate on conceptual change within particular domains of subject knowledge. Lim6n and Mason present four current, theoretical perspectives of conceptual change, com- pared and contrasted by Mayer (2002). In Chi and Roscoe's (2002) view, concep- tual change is a process of cognitive repair of incorrect mental models, where concepts miscategorized result in misconceptions. Addressing misconceptions becomes con- cerned with the recategorization of concepts, a cognitive repair approach taking place within learners' minds. diSessa (2002) regards learners as organisers of complex knowledge systems (conceptual ecology) in which knowledge becomes organized from the fragmented to the structured; the mechanism for conceptual change is not a simple process of deletion or replacement but rather a complex cognitive process of integration and reorganization. Vosnaidou (2002) depicts conceptual change as a process of synthesis, whereby learners seek to build a coherent explanatory frame- work as they attempt to reconcile inconsistent explanatory models by integrating material from new science experiences with existing frameworks. This is a gradual process which can result in a progression of mental models rather than involving sudden replacement of misconceptions. Ivarsson et al. (2002) present a sociocultural perspective where cognition requires the use of appropriate cultural tools. Learners' participation involves intellectual tools (e.g. concepts) and physical tools (e.g. artefacts) within relevant social activities, and challenges the assumption that human mental functions are located within individuals. Whilst a universal theoretical model of conceptual change remains elusive, a central tenet of conceptual change is predicated on the notion that learners need to become dissatisfied with their existing conceptions. A common instructional strategy for promoting such disaffection is that of introducing cognitive conflict. Cognitive conflict is intended to bring into question the usefulness of the learners' thinking, hopefully paving the way for the adoption of the more 'scientific' concept. However, a diversity of factors may influence the status of learners' concepts, including the range of knowledge, analogies, epistemological commitments and beliefs of the learner. These factors constitute a critical element affecting both assimilation and accommodation, and their complexity probably accounts for the limited scope of cognitive conflict as an instructional strategy. Whilst it may produce a positive response in some students, others fail to recognize the conflict or only partially resolve it using alternative conceptions (Dreyfus et al., 1990; Trumper, 1997; Tao &amp; Gunstone, 2000). Responses may also be associated with the degree of commit- ment they have to their existing ideas. For example, the empirical study on electricity found that when learners with firmly established ideas about the workings of an electrical circuit with one bulb were challenged through the construction of more complex circuits (two bulbs in series), there was a general reluctance to engage in scrutiny through the generation of questions. The converse was true of learners who started with less formalised ideas on electricity. The evolution of questions in the latter case was greater in both quantity and depth. Thus, research seems to indicate that conceptual change leading toward the understanding of scientific theories is often a variable and difficult process requiring of the learner considerable mental engagement with the subject matter. Research in</page><page sequence="8">826 J. Parker the latter part of the twentieth century focused more on domain-specific theories of learning, as opposed to the search for all-encompassing, grand theories that formerly dominated psychology and education (Mayer, 2002). Conceptual change research located within subject-specific domains is concerned with the acquisition of science concepts, and whilst this is undoubtedly important for intending primary teachers, it is not the only critical subject-related issue. How this knowledge is translated into effective classroom practice is paramount. The empirical studies provide powerful insight into the dynamic evolution of subject-related pedagogy as trainees engage in learning science. This is exemplified in the following example of learning about force. The context of floating and sinking is commonly employed in the primary sector as a suitable vehicle through which to develop conceptions of force and motion. A central concern that emerged from the empirical studies lay in supporting learners in confronting the commonly held and deeply rooted intuitive notion that weight is the only determining factor, or that weight and 'other factors' (which were varied and rarely expressed in any formal relationship) are the determining factors. In confronting this perception learners were engaged in: * predicting and testing whether objects would float/sink and identifying underlying reasoning; * exploring heavy floating objects and light sinking objects; * devising, exploring and reviewing personal hypotheses; * focused investigation employing systematic addition of water to a screw capped jar. Outcomes revealed significant differences in individual thinking and it proved impossible to predict from starting points the exact progress any individual would make during the session. Learners with apparently the same starting points would often arrive at different conclusions. Some progressed towards linking concepts of weight and size together in a relationship, which proved to be a useful framework for facilitating spontaneous reasoning about the forces acting. The linking of weight and size (weight for size) had wide explanatory power (objects being heavy for their size would sink and objects light for their size would float) and could be related meaningfully to formal teaching on density as well as learners' general knowledge (for example, how submarines work). An important pedagogical insight arising here was the explicit recognition on behalf of trainees that this linking had formed a significant aspect of learning: 'I realized that I hadn't linked these [weight and size] in my mind before and that's why it was confusing.' Although many learners with similar starting points made progress towards such a view of forces, others simply confirmed their original thinking (for example, the determining factor is the air content of the object). It became apparent that individ- uals possessed personal learning agendas. This accords with von Glaserfeld's (1992) view of constructivist learning in that teaching is a social activity, but learning is a private act with understanding being constructed by each individual 'knower'. The challenge for the teacher then becomes one of how best to facilitate learning within the learner's framework of reference. Although individual learning is largely unpre-</page><page sequence="9">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 827 dictable in a detailed sense, the studies were of value in indicating the likely holistic development of a group. For instance, although not all students ultimately linked the concepts of weight and size as cognitive underpinning for interpreting the effect of forces acting on objects, many of them did. This constituted a substantial advance in their thinking. The explicit knowledge that some students will adhere to notions of air content enables the teacher to incorporate exploration of this more effectively into future practice. The point at which teaching activities may serve to confirm learners' misconceptions constitutes important pedagogic knowledge for both in- tending teachers and initial teacher training (ITT) course provision. Context dependent/independent change Research indicates that learning is often bound to context, and learners frequently fail to transfer learned concepts to different contexts (Tao &amp; Gunstone, 2000). For example, a learner might recognize evaporation occurring in situations where there is a direct source of heat, such as the Sun or an electric kettle, and yet fail to recognize evaporation in situations where there is no obvious heat source, such as the evaporation of water from a puddle on a dull day (SPACE Research, 1990). The empirical studies on force identified key points at which learners experienced difficulty in transferring concepts across contexts. Key ideas about balanced/unbal- anced forces developed from the floating and sinking context were transferred to static contexts (such as bridges) and motion, both vertical and horizontal. Significant features of the learning process were then identified. The key ideas retained by learners were as follows: * weight is a downward force; * gravity is a downward force; * water exerts an upthrust/upward force; * forces are in balance in floating objects; * forces are unbalanced in sinking objects; * forces act in pairs; * forces act in opposite directions; * the relationship of weight to size determines floating. Students were then asked to apply their reasoning to a simple arched bridge model that was progressively loaded until it eventually collapsed. Most students identified weight as a downward acting force, especially as the bridge was loaded, but many wrestled with the notion of a counteracting upward force to balance out the downward force. They reasoned that until the bridge collapsed that there would still be an equal and opposite force to counteract the load (weight) but were generally confused about how this might be supplied. They also struggled to explain how the bridge continued to support an increasing load without collapse: 'How does the bridge know how much force to push back with?' (author emphasis). This anthropo- morphic misconception of force as an entity belonging to or residing in an object contrasts with the scientific view of force resulting from interaction between objects.</page><page sequence="10">828 J. Parker The more complex the structures used, the more the learners struggled to apply their reasoning. Although learners appeared to have successfully internalized the concept of weight as a force, inconsistencies emerged in applying it more widely. An interesting scenario that often causes consternation in physics education concerns the phenom- enon of objects of the same size but different masses hitting the ground at the same time when being dropped from the same height. The intuitive response here is that heavy objects would (or should) fall faster. Students may fail to transfer the concept that weight is a force accurately to the new context of vertical motion. Through reflection, however, they were able to pinpoint the central issue that the weight of an object acts constantly to accelerate the object in vertical motion: The key for me is what does it need to move it. You don't think that when something falls it needs to be moved, it just does. But heavier objects will need more force to move them ... I see it now. In exploring the fine detail of individual learning in this way it is possible for tutors and trainees alike to become aware of points in the learning of particular subject matter where there is likely to be difficulty in transferring concepts across contexts. Recognizing why there is difficulty in doing so is a very powerful and motivating learning tool. Developing meaningful explanations A key element of conceptual change is dependent upon learners developing coher- ent, mechanistic, causal explanations for the events they observe. Here the distinc- tion between developing understanding as opposed to knowing becomes paramount. Meaningful explanation lies at the heart of both the scientific endeavour as well as personal learning and, therefore, science education. Various models of learners' explanations have been described (Solomon, 1986; Metz, 1991; Woodruff &amp; Meyer, 1997) showing a progressive trend from pre-causal to causal explanations that provide the learner with a convincing rationale for the phenomenon under scrutiny. Such causal explanations are highly valued by learners and contain considerable explanatory power (Gilbert et al., 1988) and are, therefore, more likely to lead towards context independent conceptual change. Discovering that your causal explanation fails to support observation can be a destabilizing and yet necessary precondition for conceptual change. For example, in the empirical study on electricity the following conflict arose for a student consider- ing how it can be that two bulbs wired in series in a simple electrical circuit can glow with equal, albeit dimmer, brightness. The anthropomorphic implication often made here by learners is that somehow the electrical circuit knows how to share the current between two bulbs. For this learner there was a strong conflict with their view that the battery served to 'push' the electrical current around the circuit and that energy was transferred at the bulb. In such a paradigm the first bulb would receive more of the energy and should, therefore, glow brighter. In order to make progress in such</page><page sequence="11">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 829 thinking it is necessary to adopt a holistic view of the circuit in which any component affects the entire circuit. As electricity is an abstract concept that cannot be seen but is manifest in its effects, such that it makes a bulb light or a motor turn, teaching often incorporates the use of analogy to support learning at the qualitative level. A closed water circuit analogy is commonly used to help learners develop a holistic view of an electrical circuit. It goes like this: water is circulated with a pump into which constrictions can be placed which will impact upon flow in the whole system. The intention here is that the learner takes the characteristic of action in one part of the water circuit having an effect simultaneously on the whole circuit, in what is termed the base domain (the analogy) to the target domain (electrical circuit). However, after practical investigation and consideration of this analogy the student still adhered to their original sequential premise: 'Surely any system with one energizing point must be sequential.' The student had focused on the pumping mechanism of the water pump circuit as being the energizing equivalent of a battery in the electrical circuit and as such had failed to transfer the relevant aspects of the analogy. Analogical reasoning in science has been well documented by research (see, for example, Gentner &amp; Gentner, 1983; Shipstone, 1984; Wong, 1993; Heywood, 2002) and clearly needs to be scrutinized with caution when it comes to teaching/ learning in the classroom, in the sense that learners will only find analogies useful when they resonate strongly with experience within the targeted transfer from base domain to target domain. This is important pedagogical knowledge for intending teachers. In promoting critical scrutiny of ideas in science there can develop a considerable tension when dealing with abstract concepts such as forces and electricity: I don't want an analogy now ... I want the facts. I don't know what the facts are, I want someone to tell me ... every time we get an analogy they come to an end and there's always something you need an answer to. This comment reflects the frustration experienced when existing causal explanations fail and yet science does not seem to provide a satisfactory answer. The problematic nature of some aspects of science is likely to be a source of friction, concern and alienation for learners (Cobern &amp; Loving, 2002). Knowing where this is likely to occur within conceptual domains constitutes valuable pedagogic knowledge for teachers and the empirical studies served to highlight this with students. For instance, there is almost an implicit assumption that there is complete agreement by science educators as to the nature of phenomena such as electricity. Even a cursory conceptual exploration and discussion with fellow colleagues is likely to reveal this not to be the case (see, for instance, Black &amp; Harlen's [1993] account of a physicist's view of electricity). Sharing such knowledge with learners can help to develop their views of the nature of science. When an explanation appears to make sense in one context, its efficacy is then explored in other familiar contexts. This was readily observed when students made a link between weight and size in floating and sinking: Adding water to the jar increases its mass for size [density]. It's like a submarine isn't it?</page><page sequence="12">830 J. Parker It [jar] would float higher in salty water because salty water's denser! Buoyancy aids make you bigger but not much heavier so you float. Such an opportunity afforded by the process for them to make sense of tacit knowledge of how the world seems to work within the paradigm of their emergent ideas was an important part of the construction of conceptions. Application of such knowledge in different contexts and in hypothetical thought experiments often ensued, following newly developed thinking: 'If we put helium in it instead of air it would be lighter and float higher.' A critical element of conceptual change identified by learners was the issue of rationalizing explanation with experience and everyday observation. They were able to recognize this in practice: 'It's a bit like trying it out to see how good it is-if it fits in lots of ways'. Domain-specific learning Each scientific domain presents its own array of specific cognitive challenges and key elements of learning. If trainees are to become expert in synthesizing subject and pedagogy they will need to build up their own personal knowledge of not only the subject area itself but also the difficulties for learners inherent within the relevant conceptual area. The empirical studies have provided insight into what these might look like. For example, some key features of learning with respect to day and night and seasonal change identified by trainees were: * spatial awareness-practical modelling was paramount in visualization and explor- ing hypotheses, both personal and scientific; * two- and three-dimensional reasoning-presented considerable problems in the in- terpretation of written and diagrammatic representations of three-dimensional situations. This is particularly apparent in exploring phases of the Moon and seasonal change; * spin and orbit-must be differentiated in a scientific sense for effective communi- cation and interpretation. General descriptions (e.g. going round, turning, or moving round) obscure scientific meaning with regard to seasonal change and phases of the Moon; * the Earth's tilt-failure to appreciate the significance of this feature resulted in difficulty in understanding seasonal change; * light shining on a sphere-physical experience of this phenomenon enabled learners to recognize how light falls on a sphere and to identify the implications for light/shadow that result. Student perspectives revealed some elements of knowledge and learning in this conceptual area that have received scant attention in science education texts. For example, in seasonal change emphasis is generally placed on the position of the Earth's tilt as it orbits the Sun. Learners' perspectives have augmented this with valuable insights into key elements involved in the construction of understanding, as illustrated above. In this there are particular features of learning that can be identified alongside likely obstacles to understanding. The inherent difficulty within</page><page sequence="13">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 831 the subject matter itself identified by students as they undergo teaching and learning and the building up of a picture within particular cognitive domains from this has been described as a cognitive landscape (Heywood &amp; Parker, 2001). General perspectives on the learning process As well as containing domain-specific elements of learning, a cognitive landscape also contains more generalised features of the learning process. Many of these features are well known; for instance, students placed particular importance on the value of talk and social interaction. As learners developed the confidence to discuss their thinking, they became comfortable with the approach and recognised that it enabled them to focus on the similarities and differences between the ranges of explanation they were confronted with (including currently accepted scientific thinking). Competing concepts proved to be highly effective in generating discussion and fuelled the need to resolve uncertainties. It enabled them to frame productive questions that could be explored further. As Reiner (2001, p. 551) comments: 'Learning through social interaction relies heavily on the tension between views held by interacting individuals'. The tension between individual views acts as an incentive for discussion, clarification, gradual conceptual convergence and generation of conventions (Roschelle, 1992), suggesting that learners negotiate and construct socially acceptable meaning (social affordance) through an ongoing cycle of refinement. In addition, the value of being able to formulate personal hypotheses and test their ideas through practical investigations engendered a more sophisticated perception of investigation as an integral part of inquiry, providing the opportunity to review and reformulate thinking: 'The investigation let us test to see which of our ideas worked, I could see why mine didn't'. This is significant because at the outset of their education, trainees often express relatively naive views of the role of practical scientific investigations in learning, viewing such 'hands-on' involvement as necess- arily leading towards remembering and, albeit implicity, understanding. Through reflection they were progressing towards the notion that investigations enable critical scrutiny of thinking and are instrumental in generating questions, an altogether more subtle view of the role of scientific investigations which enables them to understand more thoroughly the implications of scientific inquiry in the National Curriculum (DfEE, 1999). Of course, many of the general features of the learning process identified by trainees have long been recognised as significant in developing understanding in science education research. For example, the Science Processes and Concept Explo- ration Project (SPACE, 1990-98) centred on the elicitation and development of primary children's ideas. Currently, the Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education initiative (Adey et al., 1995) is a combination of curriculum tasks and teaching methodology designed to challenge children's present concepts of science and to present them with problems that they are unable to solve using their current mental strategies. It is predicated on children constructing ideas while working on tasks with small groups; listening whilst these ideas are shared in whole-class</page><page sequence="14">832 J. Parker discussion; justifying and explaining the ideas, events and concepts met in the task. The synthesis of subject and pedagogy serves to underpin trainee resonance with the principles of such research initiatives. For example, a particularly insightful observa- tion was the recognition that there are instances in learning when pupils are required to hold two conceptions in a relationship. In considering the concept of weight for size (the preliminary to the complex, abstract notion of density) students begin to recognize the cognitive demand imposed through holding two (or more) concepts simultaneously. This is significantly more demanding than holding either concept in isolation and teachers need to be aware of the problem in specific contexts. This constitutes an extremely important issue for intending teachers, that has implica- tions for planning and support for learning in science education. I see ... to understand it [floating] you've got to link them both together [weight and size] ... that's hard. Implications The past decade has witnessed a range of changes in teacher education provision, with the issue of developing teacher subject knowledge forming a central tenet of aspirations to raise standards. Underpinning this is the assumption that a strong knowledge base will automatically result in more effective classroom practice. This supposition has been brought into question in recent years (Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 1999; Poulson, 2001), particularly within the context of primary teaching where trainees and teachers are faced with the task of teaching a wide range of subjects within the National Curriculum. Poulson (2001) examines the development of teacher-knowledge research that has proliferated since the mid 1980s in which researchers have sought a scientific basis for teaching and teacher education. In this field the work of Shulman and his associates (Shulman 1986, 1987; Grossman et al., 1989) has been highly influential. Shulman's notion of Pedagogic Content Knowl- edge (PCK) implies that if teachers are to be effective practitioners they need to possess an in-depth knowledge of how to represent the subject matter for learners. This implies a subtle and detailed knowledge of subject, combined with a complex array of various types of knowledge to promote learning. Such knowledge covers a host of issues concerned with effective representation of subject matter at the teaching/learning interface, and it is here that knowledge of learners' perspectives becomes paramount. In teaching, it is necessary both to interpret ideas and focus on the nature of explanations themselves. In the former case, the teacher could be considered as the principal interpreter of science (Eger, 1992; Heywood, 2002). The latter is perceived ostensibly in terms of pedagogy. However, to consider these elements as mutually exclusive obscures the complex symbiotic relationship that provides insight into the emergence of effective practice in science teaching. As Poulson (2001) points out, Shulman recognized that his work was focused on subject specialist secondary school teachers and as such, its applicability to the primary context, with its non-specialist teachers teaching across a wide range of subject areas requires careful interpretation. Nevertheless, research has focused on</page><page sequence="15">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 833 the extent of primary teachers' subject knowledge, its relationship to classroom practice and its role in teacher education (e.g. Wragg et al., 1989; Harlen et al., 1995; Aubrey, 1997; Maynard, 1997; Edwards &amp; Ogden, 1998). A deficit model of teacher subject knowledge is often portrayed, highlighting what teachers appear not to know and inferring that improving teacher subject knowledge results in better teaching (Bennett &amp; Carre, 1993; Aubrey, 1997). Morrison (1989) suggests that other kinds of knowledge, about children's learning and how to help the develop- ment of abstract ideas in any subject are equally as important as subject knowledge. More recent work on primary teachers' subject knowledge has continued to question this assumption (see, for example, Brown et al., [1998] on numeracy). Poulson considers whether the knowledge required to teach primary children effectively is necessarily the same as knowledge needed to support learning at an advanced level, reflecting that PCK may in fact be more important than detailed knowledge of the subject itself. The relationship between subject knowledge and teacher effectiveness remains unclear. For instance, Goulding et al. (2002) found a link between primary trainees' mathematical subject knowledge and poor planning and teaching, and in music Bennett and Turner-Bisset (1993) found that specialists perform at a higher level of competence in classroom teaching. However, other studies failed to support this premise (see, for example, Medwell et al. [1998] on literacy). Calderhead (1998) found that student teachers were likely to draw upon observed practices of supervising teachers rather than their own knowledge base and gave low priority to their own subject knowledge in planning (Maynard, 1997). As Poulson (2001) comments: Instead of highlighting, and attempting to remedy apparent deficits in primary teachers' subject knowledge, the educational research and policy agenda for the twenty-first century would do well to include investigation of teachers' learning in both formal and informal contexts. One of the main characteristics of primary pupils' learning is the lack of overall structures; pupils do not have ideas that link one phenomenon with another in the way a scientist would see them as related (Harlen et al., 1995). Progression in children's ideas depends on helping them to link related ideas, and to do this a teacher must recognise the links and their formation in practice. Harlen et al., propose a reinterpretation of ITT based on the premise that if teaching science to young children involves securing understanding of progressively more general, abstract and powerful scientific ideas, then ITT might usefully adopt a conceptual change model based on eliciting and negotiating meanings. It may be sufficient that teachers undergo the conceptual change model only once or twice in order to appreciate its applicability in other areas. However, they view the application of the same argument with regard to the development of pedagogical concepts as being more problematic. The empirical studies add to the debate in providing powerful evidence that through critical scrutiny of the learning of subject matter, trainee teachers can, and do, engage in both the development of personal science knowledge and the pedagogic knowledge to underpin effective classroom practice. Learners' perspectives have revealed valuable insights into the characteristics of learning in</page><page sequence="16">834 J. Parker subject-specific domains, including some novel aspects as well as valuable pedagog- ical learning as illustrated. Such PCK perspectives have served to identify difficulties experienced by learners in assimilating or accommodating science concepts, and revealed insights into how difficulties are resolved on a personal basis. As they undergo learning, trainees will inevitably develop their thinking about the teaching and learning process. Thus, what students recognise as being significant with respect to how they learned science can be used as a means of determining a synthesis of subject and pedagogic knowledge. Such knowledge has productively informed course development on both undergraduate and postgraduate ITT courses. In focusing on the learning process, students are provided with the oppor- tunity to identify those elements that they consider critical to developing under- standing. This has the advantage of engendering empathy and resonance with the condition of being a learner in science, and attends to the dual problem of addressing how ideas are generated, and which explanations are useful. If teachers are to develop their understanding of these processes it is necessary to consider each of these elements and a powerful mechanism for doing this is to generate insight through making explicit student perspectives on the learning process in situ. The requirements in science for primary QTS focus concern on knowledge acquisition such that knowing appears to be privileged over understanding. Develop- ing understanding is a worthwhile and valued goal in education because of its enabling properties with regard to satisfying curiosity, promoting feelings of confidence and competence and facilitating further learning (Newton, 2001). The attendant problems inherent within a knowledge transfer view of learning science relate to trainees' conceptualization as to the nature of learning, in terms of what constitutes subject and pedagogic knowledge. Teachers' perceptions of a discipline significantly influences their teaching of the subject. There is evidence to suggest that many university students emerge from higher education courses with only a declarative surface knowledge of their subjects (Dart et al., 1998). In the process of reviewing their epistemological beliefs, teachers are more likely to scrutinise their insight into what is required in science learning and identify both the scope and limitation of scientific explanation. Gamache (2002) points out that university students often have inappropriate conceptions of learning and what it involves. They tend to see knowledge as an external body of facts, and learning as the assimilation and recapitulation of this data. He suggests that development of an alternative epistemological view would enable students to see themselves as creators of 'per- sonal knowledge'. In practical terms this would enable them to question the implicit notion that the pedagogical task is concerned with constructing an agreed consensus of knowing, as if meaning is uniquely comprehensible and merely awaiting linguistic expression. The inherent contradiction in subscribing to such a position is explicitly exemplified in the case of analogies in developing understanding of abstract phe- nomena such as electricity (Heywood, 2002). Lunn (2002) points out that there are good reasons to believe that teachers' views on the nature of science form a significant part of a 'hidden' curriculum in their science teaching. Devlin (2002), in considering routes to enhancing and improving the quality of student learning, states that in order to think reflectively, tertiary students must take</page><page sequence="17">Effective learning and teaching in primary science 835 responsibility for their learning through metacognitive input, which begins with knowing about cognition, particularly one's own cognitive strategies. The empirical studies show how this affords the trainee the opportunity to develop a synthesis of subject and pedagogy for the promotion of effective practice, and engenders teacher empathy with pupil learning because of their own experiences of acquiring under- standing in science. In the drive towards achieving the standards in qualifying to teach, there is an implicit expectation that acknowledges the need for trainee teachers to develop their professional repertoire and range of analogies, explanations and metaphors, that contribute to successfully supporting pupils in understanding science. In response to this, there has emerged a pervasive focus on teacher subject knowledge, that whilst understandable, has paradoxically engendered a perception of trainee teachers' learning as being essentially about technical acquisition. This has resulted in a focus on pedagogy conceptualised as teaching privileged over learning, exemplified in an attendant nomenclature that explicitly promotes apprenticeship modes. In higher education we therefore have initial teacher training rather than initial teacher education, with the concept of student teacher replaced with that of trainee and a focus on training rather than educating. Integral to this perception is the contentious issue of an action-theory divide (Tomlinson, 1999b) which has had particular influence in determining what counts for evidence based research that pragmatically informs practice, with the consequent marginalization of the value of reflection. The additional constraint imposed through changes in practice that include the introduc- tion of flexible routes to qualified teacher status, and the decline in the allocation of course budget time for core science in both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, has the potential to further this perception. The evidence presented here suggests that this interpretation needs radical re- evaluation and that appropriate support for trainees in learning to teach needs to address the synthesis of both subject and pedagogy, an approach that engages students in reflection on their own cognitive development in their engaging with ideas during the learning processes itself. This explicitly locates reflection at the core of professional pragmatics, and is incommensurate with the notion (implicit or explicit) of a theory-practice divide. The implications at policy level in terms of an ITT National Curriculum include a need to review the research-policy-practice relation such that evidence-based research quite literally derives from teachers reflecting on those elements that have significantly contributed to their understand- ing in the learning process and how this subsequently informs their teaching. This necessitates reviewing the claims to which policy decision-making is evidence-based and the effectiveness and accessibility of research to the enterprise of promoting effective practice (Oakley, 2002).
