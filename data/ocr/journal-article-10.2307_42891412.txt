<plain_text><page sequence="1">Belli Looks at Life and Law in Japan. By Melvin M. Belli and Danny R. Jones. Indianapolis-New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1960. Pp. 320. $3.95. This book is intended as the first in a series that is to include studies of the (Iranian?) Code of Hammurabi and of the (Turkish?) Laws of Jus- tinian after Mr. Belli will have visited Iran and Turkey, as well as of that "great Chief- Justice" ( !) Confucius - and Jesus Christ.1 This review is written for the sole purpose of trying to induce the distinguished publisher to withdraw from participation in this new phase of Mr. Belli's advertis- ing campaign. The chapters devoted to Japanese "life" are not bad at all. They could be part of any one of the many (though mostly better) travelogues, and ac- knowledgment is duly made to both the efforts of a gentleman "who trav- eled to Japan to help gather some of the material" and Sir James Frazer's famous Golden Bough.2 To be sure, there are some astounding gaps in these chapters. But if we get nothing of art or theater - except for some lovely photographs including one of "Melvin M. Belli, Shown Examining Bullets on Site of Girard Case" 3 - we are richly compensated by several pages on Japanese toilets.4 The remaining chapters are a haphazard, rambling, ill-written collection of comments on Japanese "law." Much of it is astoundingly illiterate. We learn that "most societies in recorded history have provided some sort of punishment for violators of their social riiles" ; 5 that "the stare decisis, or case law system [ !], is not used as a method of teaching in Japanese law schools" ; 6 that "common-law England, without a constitution, has de rerum natura [!], natural law";7 and that "the Japanese are anthropomorphic."11 Compared with these statements, coinages such as the "serious or dilatory tourist student" 9 or "the now ineffectiveness of the wonderdrugs" 10 seem trifling. More annoying are statements, often tendencious, that are outright wrong. We cannot very well expect the authors to be familiar with Japanese con- ip. 19. 2 P. 295. 3 P. 128. 4 Pp. 242-44. 5 P. 150. « P. 107. 7 P. 20.

It is still harmless when we are told that "the com- parative negligence doctrine" is of English origin.20 Less so when we learn that the prospective defendant in an accident suit must "go around to the victim's home, say he's sorry, that he apologizes, and leave a bowl of fruit, or something more substantial," and that "this is solatium," an institution similar to that known "in Scotland (of all countries) and Continental law." 21 But to attribute the comparatively small size of Japanese damages even in u P. 216. 12 See Albert A.
