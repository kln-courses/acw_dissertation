<plain_text><page sequence="1">Talking Animals: Medieval Latin Beast Poetry, 750-1150. By JAN M. ZIoLKOWSKI. Pp. xii+354 (Middle Ages Series). Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993. ?33-95. Although fables of course figure largely in medieval beast literature, the use of animal characters extends far beyond the exemplary genre. The Owl and the Nightingale, Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale and The Parliament of Fowls, the Roman de Renart and its analogues in other languages, all witness to the range of texts in which animals speak up. The present study focuses on the Latin development. In that tradition, one of the arguable masterpieces of twelfth-century literature, the Ysen- grimus, and one of the same period's most successful and widely read works, Nigel Whiteacre's Speculum stultorum (Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Daun Burnel the Asse), both employ the anthropomorphic mode. The study's centre of gravity lies in the last two chapters, which treat the mid-eleventh-century Ecbasis captivi and the Ysengrimus, respectively. Ziolkowski builds his reading of the Ecbasis around the aesthetics of its extensive web of quotations, its framed structure of a tale within a tale, its Paschal thematics, and a structure of dialogue that possibly suggests semi-dramatic reading in a monastic community. The poem's constant quotation of earlier verse has drawn a variety of critical reactions, including charges of plundering, dismissals of the borrowings as superficial ornamentation, and readings as parody. Ziolkowski differs with all of these, contending that the poet's 'noncritical parody' gives the text depth by appeal to the sources' language and thought. The quotations thus function as a sort of 'internal gloss'. At the same time, Ziolkowski defends the text's eccentric envelope structure, which serves to contrast the Old and New Laws, a contrast intimately bound up with the oppositional structures encoded in the liturgy of the Easter Vigil. He takes issue with earlier interpretations of the poem as either historical allegory (which attends to the poem's details at the expense of its overall structure) or religious allegory (which generalizes about the outer story's structure without examining the whole text in satisfactory detail). Ziolkowski's approach to the Ysengrimus echoes critical gestures already developed in the Ecbasis chapter. He sees the use of the wolf-monk in the later poem as allowing 'extensive noncritical parody of liturgy and of monastic rite'. He contends that his approach, first advanced in his own 1981 dissertation, allows a way around exhausted RES New Series, Vol. XLVII, No. 186 (1996) ( Oxford University Press 1996</page><page sequence="2">230 REVIEWS Quellenforschungen. Ultimately, the wolf-monk's downfall is effected as a sort of 'revenge of the liturgy' upon one who has resolutely exploited its letter at the expense of its spirit. 'Thus the poem combines a trust in the institutions and ceremonies of religion with a disappointment in the ecclesiastics who oversee them' (p. 233). Ziolkowski's first five chapters are in some sense prelude to these last two but are not without their own interest. They draw together in very full detail the intermittent history of Latin beast poetry up to the eleventh century-a history all the more difficult to write for the lack of a satisfactorily demonstrable linear development. Along the way, the author offers thorough readings of the Carolingian poem 'The Sick Lion' from St Gall MS 899, of Sedulius Scottus' 'The Ram', and of Walahfrid Strabo's De quodam somnio. Ziolkowski's interpretation of this last poem is bold and original. His strong enthusiasm for Sedulius' text is infectious. He offers his own English versions among the thirty-two pieces translated as appendices to the volume. This is a book of many strengths and much usefulness. At the same time, it is not without its flaws. Points small and large in the earlier chapters could be made more succinctly, and occasionally I found the style ponderous. The notion of non-critical parody, furthermore, could benefit from more attention to the work on intertextuality of Michael Riffaterre, Peter Dembowski, and other critics. A discussion of such theories might well lead the author to adjust his essentially conservative approach to quotation, and to question more sharply the possibility of citational practices that do not in some sense destabilize the borrowed text itself. Finally, I was disappointed not to find a treatment of the third, and undeniably the most popular, of the longest Latin beast poems, Nigel's Speculum stultorum. The author suggests briefly (p. 13) that the poem represents a departure from the tradition, in that it makes little use of the animal trickster prominent in earlier texts, and so he closes the book with Ysengrimus and a date of 1150, rather than extending his scope another generation to include Nigel. But as the early chapters of the book make clear, shared elements and a number of demonstrable connections among the earlier texts hardly amount to a substantially integrated and organic development. Beast literature is unified neither by genre nor by genealogy, and a full reading of the Speculum would have filled, in fact, an even more conspicuous gap in recent secondary literature than a treatment of the Ysengrimus, which received very copious attention from Jill Mann in the introduction to her translation of 1987. Given Ziolkowski's own impressive and extensive contributions to Nigel scholarship, including editions of two of the other works in the canon, one hopes that he will take up Nigel's most successful (and most enjoyable) work at some not-too-distant time. Despite my reservations on such points, I recommend the present volume as a useful and erudite contribution to its field. University of Toronto DAVID TOWN?SEND</page></plain_text>
