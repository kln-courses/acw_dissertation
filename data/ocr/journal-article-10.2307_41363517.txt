<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dec. 19, 1947 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN 75 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EXHIBITION AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY By Basil Gray, m.a. Keeper of Oriental Antiquities , British Museum India and Burma Section, Thursday, December 4th, 1947 Sir Frank Noyce, k.c.s.i., in the Chair The Chairman: As we' have all heard from our youth up, some people are horn great, some people achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. I am in the extrémely unfortunate position of having had greatness thrust upon me this afternoon. About five minutes agö I was asked- and, indeed, it was a great honour to be asked- to take the Chair this afternoon in the deeply regretted absence of Lord Wavell, who is unfortunately indisposed and has been forbidden by his doctor to leave the house. It is indeed a very great disappointment to us that he is unable to be here, for we all know how wide his literary and artistic tastes are and I am sure he would have had some most interesting and illuminating comments to make on the lecture we are about to hear. Lord Wavell has asked that his deep apologies should be expressed to the meeting and has said how very disappointed he is that he is unable to be here to-day. I think that Mr. Basil Gray needs very little introduction to most of you here. He is the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities at the British Museum and we could have no greater authority to address us on the subject he has chosen for his lecture this afternoon. The following Paper was then read : Your three societies to whom I am addressing my lecture were the bodies which sponsored or instigated the exhibition which opened last week at the Royal Academy. I am, therefore, going to render to you - though, of course, in no sense officially - an account of the charge which you gave to the organising committee of the exhibition. You had, I must suppose, the conviction that the British public was ready to look with favouť and understanding on Indian aft, and that an exhibition was not only due, but overdue. I must suppose too, that your members had considered the difficulties of worthily representing the art of such extensive and varied regions through all their long history in a temporary ч xhibition on the other side of the world. I must confess that I had for years previously viewed with no little apprehension any such attempt being made. For if all that the generations of our men, who had spent their lives in India, had brought back with them and had written about, had failed to win more than a very limited and very grudging recog- nition of the status of Indian art, how could it be hoped to gather an exhibition which, in a winter's season, could change the traditional scepticism, or/to call it by its true name, ignorance of this art ? But your Societies, taking, no doubt, a wider view and informed with a knowledge of what might be done, fortunately persisted, and the task was undertaken. When the exhibition committee was formed, we realised that there was no chance of success unless we could gain the support of the Government of India - this was, of course, in 1946, long before the coming of independence and partition. That support was promised, and I believe I am right in attributing a great share in that decision to Field-Marshal Earl Wavell who so unfortunately is unable to be</page><page sequence="2">76 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Dec. 19, 1947 present to-day. A committee was set up in India under the chairmanship of Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, and it is to her more than to any other one person that the representative character of the exhibition is due. The abundance of her energy is astounding, and she is that rare being, a statesman who is also a poet, always confident of the importance of the things of the mind and spirit. She was the moving spirit behind that highly interesting experiment, the Inter- Asia Conference, which was held at Delhi last March, and which was accompanied by two exhibitions, one of modern art and the other concerning the historical connections between Indian art and that of her neighbours. Her confidence and vision heartened the delegation, who went out from London to make the selection, before the formidable task that faced them of covering so huge a field in the short space of eight weeks. It is not my intention to speak of the intensely interesting, if rather breathless, tour which we made, or of the many who helped us, but I think it should be known that the selection is ours ; not, therefore, what India and Pakistan wish to represent them to the West, but what the delegation judged to be the most representative of their art. The standard that we held before us was to admit only objects of art and not documents of archaeology, history or ethnology ; and to remember always the august line of exhibitions in whose succession this one follows. It did not take me long to realise that the material was there in abundance, the level of technique extraordinarily high, and the richness of the schools of sculpture far more prodigal than I had realised - there was a tradition as wide, as developed, and as varied at least as that of pre- Renaissance Europe. And the difficulties of presentation are as great in both cases, and here it is not simply a question of helping the public to leap the gulf of time, but also to understand, to some extent át least, the civilisation whose expression this art is. I feel quite confident of the judgment of artists, of those to whom works of art speak directly by their formal qualities. They wTill recognise, without possibility of error, the work of a great school. I was lately struck when reading Sir Osbert Sitwell's selections from Walter Sickerťs critical writings to find him coupling, in 19 12, the names of Greeks and Indians as master sculptors, without self consciousness or fear of contradiction - and this was by reference to the sculptures from Amara vati од the main staircase of the British Museum, passed every day by hundreds of people. Sickert in the passage speaks of a sense of "building up" which the spectator has before good sculpture, of its fullness of content. I had myself thought of the formal exuberance, an exuberance not of multiplication of detail but of fullness of form, bursting as it were through the crust of stone. This is achieved not by violent action or by exaggerated naturalism, but on the contrary through simplification, con- ventionalisation of drapery and a mastery of the material which throughout the school is astonishing, even in the hard granites and basalts. In drawing, too, the Indian tradition is very sound. In each section of the exhibition devoted to painting there are examples of fine draughtsmanship which show complete technical competence. The ordinary instrument of the draughtsman was a very fine brush and the line was habitually used to de-limit form. Whether in wall-painting or painting on paper it was usual to work on a prepared ground, and correction was rarely necessary. Once again, the artist is master of his medium. What is he seeking to express with it ? Take the exquisite drawing of the milkmaids</page><page sequence="3">Dec. 19, 1947 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN JJ in an arbour - here is evidently a mood of lyrical freshness; we may perhaps be reminded of Puvis de Chavannes. But I do not think this Indian drawing is to be considered as a modern work of sensibility, though it is probably no earlier than the eighteenth century. This is the authentic work of an age of faith, where tradition meant a way of living, as well as a way of painting. For parallel I shall look to the early Greek with its same felicity of simple vital rhythm, but the natural world is more intimately felt in the Indian drawing. This is an unusual drawing of a rare school; generally the artist is more interested in composing in depth and his drawing is clearly waiting to be completed in colour. Appreciation in the visual arts has been so greatly widened in the West in the last generation that it is no longer difficult to appreciate work done in accordance with quite different conventions. We do not expect to bring the same sensibility to an oriental painting as to a modern European or a Renaissance painting. We do not expect to find all painters interested in the mosaic of surface appearance or in a formal system of mass built up on chiaroscuro. We know of several systems of perspective and have learnt that it is necessary to go some of the way to meet a painter in order to see what it is he is trying to do. It is as well first to realise the historical and economic conditions which produced the kinds of painting which are shown at the Royal Academy. Every educated person knows that India had a classic school of painting, has heard of Ajanta, and is more or less aware of the period, from the first to the sixth century A.D., of the paintings in the cave shrines and monastries. But the partnership of painting with architecture and sculpture did not stop there. There was as continuous a tradition of painting as in Gothic Europe. It was when the big Hindu kingdoms fell before the Muhammadan invaders and patronage was limited, that painters were restricted to pictures on palm leaf manuscripts and on cotton cloth. The medieval schools of both Eastern India (Pala) and the West (Gujrata) show a decline after 1200 in the East and after 1350 in the West; they were becoming more and more stereotyped. But a new movement was about to sweep over the country, the great Hindu revival, popular and making use of the vernacular speech of the people, a religious movement mainly Vaishnavite, which manifested itself above all in poetry and music, but also in dancing and painting. It is the later fruit of this movement which, for the most part, fills the two galleries at the exhibition devoted to Rajput painting. Unless it is realised how familiar were the choice of subjects treated, how the love songs of the Gita govinda were on everyone's lips and the various Raga modes taught to everyone, the essential character of this art and its passionate account cannot be fully appreciated. Only then will it be possible to see how great are the varieties of treating the same themes; how the sophisticated science of the Rajasthani school had developed a colour technique as intellectual as the Sienese for the treatment of Ragmalas (Fig. 1, p. 69) how the simple court painter of the remote Basohli state concentrated all his skill on the evocation of each movement of love in his Mayika or heroine types. He will see the same universal sentiment more romantically and individually treated by the artists of the Kangra school. And what, you will say, of Mughal painting? Is this something wholly different, alien to India and a more exotic growth fostered in the artificial conditions of an</page><page sequence="4">78 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Dec. 19, 1947 alien court? I think not. The Mughal house, in its earlier rulers, and above all in Akbar, had an acute sense of the genius of India. He borrowed and developed her architecture and patronised her great musicians and poets; he studied her epics and her religion; and he adopted her land tenure and respected her military skill. He tried to build a great united Indian culture, and he nearly succeeded. If you can trust me, I assure you that after the third quarter of the sixteenth century the Mughal style of painting was already so formed that I have never seen a drawing about which there could be any reasonable doubt as to its being executed in Persia or India. After all we should know, for the history of painting in our own country shows how immediately an alien artist's work is modified to suit the taste of his new patrons. And in India Akbar tells us that he found a vigorous school, which only needed Imperial patronage to produce great monuments like the Jaipur Räzmänma and the several more on view at Burlington House (Fig. 2, p. 69). To return to the sculpture. I have said that I feel no doubt about the verdict of artists, of the man or woman who is interested in technique or the solution of formal problems. But we all know that most people are interested, broadly speaking, in the subject of a work of art, that is, what the artist was seeking to express, and on this side the general public undoubtedly needs help and guidance. I hope that members of your Societies are anxious to see this enterprise, which you have set on foot, carried through to fulfilment, and that you will help with your varied experiences of eastern life and civilisation to relate the microcosm, which we have tried to present at Burlington House, to your whole art and civilisation. I shall try, in what follows, to give: some clues which I have myself found helpful in gaining a perspective. It is only after a general picture is formed that it is possible for the majority to gain clearer insight and understanding. Leaving aside the small sculpture of the ancient Indus Valley civilisation, as being incomparably more remote than anything else in the exhibition - fascinating in its strangeness, its part in the ancient world, and its mixture of heartlessness with refinement- and passing on many centuries to the Mauryan age, our public will find a school which is probably more easily comprehensible than any which follows. Of all sculpture we are shame- fully ignorant, but the monumental style is that least ignored. Consequently the Bull capital rightly first meets the eye of the visitor as he mounts the stairs; it is a master- piece of monumental sculpture, conveying, as it does, an impression of naturalism, of the ideal Bull type expressed with great economy. We are ignorant of the signi- ficance of this symbol placed by Asoka on the top of a forty-foot column in the open at Rampurva, bearing one of the texts of his famous edict and near another pillar crowned by a lion. None the less it serves us as an admirable symbol of the great enlightened despot. The other outstanding monumental figure is the headless Yaksha of a King in Gallery I (Fig. 3, p. 70). This weighty figure with its heavy, simple drapery has the regal air of the King as judge, impersonal and representative of order and justice. Very different in feeling is the torso, not in the exhibition, of Kanishka, the Kushan King (2nd century a.D.) with its masterful stance and more individual treatment of the robes. We have passed from an art, akin to that of the Hittites or of Egypt, to one nearer to archaic Greece. Not that the monumental is altogether lacking from Kushan sculpture. There are -several figures of Bodhisattvas in the typical Mathura stone, of which one is</page><page sequence="5">Dec. 19, 1947 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN 79 exhibited in the Great Gallery in Burlington House, and which retain something of this monumental quality. And, indeed, it is by no means absent from the Seated Buddha (Fig. 4, p. 71) on the opposing wall, which is almost certainly from the very early fourth century A.D. just before the beginning of the Gupta period. But this figure, which is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of Indian sculpture, is informed with an entirely new spirit. Weight and gravity are here, and still the simplified folds and formalised hair which belong to an early stage in a civilisation like that of sixth century Greece, but behind is the transcendental spirit of a faith which taught of tranquillity above the accidents of the transitory world. But we must retrace our steps to glance at the earlier narrative art of Buddhism, as shown in the great series of sculptures from the major pilgrimage centres of Bharhut, Sanchi and Bodhgaya and the rich southern shrine of Amaravati. With this sort of carving, in which the main incidents in the life of Gautama Buddha were constantly repeated, we are familiar in medieval Christian art. We have the same plain and economical treatment of the salient facts and the same joyful spirit in scenes where the heavenly and the earthly touch. Compare the heavenly beings who bear the relics of the Buddha or the heiratic following of the "Ride forth from Kapilavastu" with the representations of the "Last Judgment" or "Palm Sunday". There are, of course, great differences. This Buddhist art of the two centuries b.c. and A.D. was carved upon the simplest architectural members, upright and cross pieces of a stone fence, imitating exactly a wooden form of construction, or upon the casing of the stupas themselves. Consequently the decoration is concentrated at the crossing or in friezes, and the shapes are either roundels or strips, occasionally in spandrels. On the other hand, the compositions are more dynamic than in the early medieval art of Europe, and at Amaravati reach an astonishing level of inspired composition. It is, nevertheless, the Gupta age (a.D. 320-590) which is regarded as the classic period of Indian sculpture in the sense that it sets the line for the subsequent development. And here we meet the two elements which constitute the main achievement of Indian sculpture : the first the presentation of cosmic themes through anthropomorphic art, and the second the enrichment of architecture with decoration and sculpture unrivalled for freedom and vitality in any other school of the world. This decoration, based on plant forms, and bird, animal and dwarf motives (Fig. 5, p. 72) has the swing and finish of the best Roman decoration, like the Ara Pacis, and is capable of the same big scale, as, for instance, in the great frieze round the stupa at Sarnath ; but it also gives an extraordinary sense of profusion and, consequently, of vitality. And this is one of the marks of mature Indian sculpture. The cycle of birth and decay, of time and infinity, and the impression of form upon matter are the great themes which inspire the sculptors' representation of the Hindu pantheon. And the Buddhist figures also are abstractions representing cosmic forces - of charity, pity, or the wisdom of contemplation. We are used to representations of superhuman figures, the over-life-size prophets and Apostles of Chartres, but they are not so abstract as these Hindu representations, to which nothing so much attributes as the whole tension of body and, above all, the expressive gestures of the hands. We are not, of course, without experience of an art based upon the human body; indeed, all Post-Renaissance sculpture in the West has made it</page><page sequence="6">8o JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Dec. 19, 1947 a central theme. But how academic and mannered all this looks beside the natural grace which seems the native idiom of the Indian sculptor! Partly this is due, no doubt, to his greater familiarity with the bare human body, but even more the difference must lie in the more serious and less artificial aim of his art. No man is so free as when he is working inside well-recognised conventions. The Gupta age saw the foundation of this mature school, but, for me at least, its finest flowering came a little later in the "Medieval" period, from the early seventh to the eleventh century. This period opens with the rock-cut cave-temples at Ellora and closes with the voluptuous carvings of Bhuvaneswar and Khajuraho. With the alphabet of his art firmly established, the sculptor could venture on extremely developed and complex compositions, and delighted especially in the torsion of the human body and the succulence of plant-forms. The greater composi- tions cannot unfortunately be shown in an exhibition; but at Burlington House in Gallery IV are some admirable examples of smaller carvings (Fig. 6, p. 72). These remind one in their virtuosity of the work of Agostino di Duccio, but it must be remembered that they are only fragments from great series covering whole temples. Such a body of work can only be carried out under a system of workshop organisation and institutional support, such as we experienced in our own Middle Ages. And so we return to the point at which we started: the "medieval" character of all post- classical Indian art. Under it the sculptor was a member of the household of a King or an institution. He may have travelled just as his fellow did in Europe, but he had an assured place as a member of a recognised craft. When large-scale temple building ceased, the painter carried on the medieval tradition, working for a patron, a Raja or a landowner, who supported him in the usual way with a grant of land. We know the names of several painters and it is probable that most of the series, which have now unfortunately disappeared, originally had colophons in which names of artists and patrons were both given. There is such a wealth of material in the fifteen galleiies at Burlington House that we are bound to be a little dazed at first, but as we explore more and more we are bound to be conscious of the extraordinary generosity of the institutions and lenders in the two Dominions who have allowed their finest, and their rarest, pieces to travel across the seas and spared them for nearly a year in all in order to give us the chance to enjoy them during these three winter months. At none of the exhibitions preceding this winter's at the Royal Academy has nearly so large a proportion of the exhibits been provided by their country of origin, and we owe them a deep debt of gratitude for this unique opportunity, which we should be foolish not to use to the full, for studying one of the great arts of the world. We may, indeed, claim for our scholars that they have done good work on the archaeological side in revealing and conserving so much of India's past, and I should like to commend to those of you who do not know it the story of the Archaeological Survey of India, in a volume edited by Sir John Cumming for the India Society which was published in 1938. But now the time has come when we need more interpretations of this art and its background, and for this we look with confidence to the writers of the two Dominions. Dr. Coomaraswamy, whom we had hoped to welcome to London this winter, but whose death we have now to mourn, has made a distinguished start, but the field is wide and the need for mutual understanding great. May this exhibition open our eyes to the qualities of a great civilisation.</page><page sequence="7">Dec. 19, 1947 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN 8l DISCUSSION After two questions had been answered very briefly by the lecturer, The Chairman said : I must confess to a feeling of disappointment that this discussion has been so brief. I take it that that is really a great compliment to our lecturer; he has covered the ground so well that there is nothing to add. That, at any rate, is my own feeling. I am quite sure that his lecture will send those of us, who have already seen the Exhibition, back to it to see it again from a new angle of vision, and make those, who have not yet been to see it, hasten to do so. Mr. Gray has dealt almost entirely with sculpture and painting. I could have wished that he had told us a little more about what I think is one of the most attractive features of the Exhibition, the exhibits from Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, as this is the first opportunity the public in this country has had of making acquaintance with the treasures excavated from those two centres of ancient civilisation. Some of us from India knew them fairly well, but there are many to whom they are new, as they are the discoveries of such a recent period. They show - and it is, I think, a matter for great regret - how little taste and workmanship in jewTellery and personal adornments have improved in the course of the last five thousand years. I would like to thank Mr. Gray on my own and your behalf for his most illuminating lecture, and for the very attractive slides he has shown us, and I think we should also thank the three societies, the Royal Society of Arts, the Royal India Society and the Royal Asiatic Society for promoting this joint lecture. It is a very happy example of tripartite co-operation, as, indeed, is the Exhibition itself of the co-operation between the Governments of two Dominions and the Government of this country. Those of us who have known and loved India will hope that that spirit of co-operation will become ever more apparent in other and wider fields. The vote of thanks was carried with acclamation, and the meeting then terminated.</page><page sequence="8">Dec. 19, 1947 THE ART OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN 69 (See page 75) 'S 'S S s ^ с g=§ S s § О I S ^ О S ез О I &lt;§ S I 1 ^ VO -s g S ^ ** О -s Ö g b s ^ ** ЧО О ^ Il g- • Й £ "s • ^ g s С ¿ к * g K S &amp; ^ Q -O ^ •1 ~ S ^ s ^ Ь &lt;з ^ -H I S ¡^ *.*£:§ f Q ^ &lt;^&gt; Ь ч«л J ^ S -a, ^ ^ •a -« с ^ '•3 * "Il al fa ^ Sd ö g §P * Й 1 л о *§ é л 00 о ^ *§ f o' - ^ * Š f Б Ê«- -S 8 ^ Q r*À 3 * S 2 i e § § 5 s « Д g § -S о 'я- s й (У * ь2 й 2 (У * ь2 Š so ь-5 s 1! о £</page><page sequence="9">70 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS Dec. 19, 1947 Fig. 3. - Headless figure of a Yaksha or King , in sandstone , from Patna , Bihar .
