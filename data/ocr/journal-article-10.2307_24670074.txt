Shabbat 33B-34A): The Talmudic Inversion of Plato's Plato's Politics of Philosophy (The story of Rashbi's sojourn in the cave is found in many rabbinic texts; its most complex version is that of b. Shabbat. Later the com position of the Zohar was attributed to him; it was considered a product of his sojourn in the cave. The story has frequently been studied for historiographical purposes, as by L.I. Levine in HUCA 49, 1979. The present study intends to com pare the story with Plato's famous allegory of the cave. We do not know whether Plato's text or at least the allegory of the cave was known in rabbinic Babylonia; but at least some awareness of Plato's political philosophy as reflected through neo-Platonism among the rabbis is plausible. Thus it is possible to read the story of Rashbi's withdrawal in the cave as an echo of Plato's allegory. This is not to deny the obvious differences, the withdrawal from civic life into the cave rather than the reverse, as in Plato's allegory, or the fact that the sage cannot return to the polis to become a philosopher-king. The rabbis were subjected to the Iranian empire and could not dream of taking charge of it; the retreat of the sage from civic life is rather a flight from its imperial governance. But despite such differences there is a meaningful relationship between the two tales. The philosopher leaves the cave, the polis, the darkness of ignorance to reach the light of knowledge which he brings with him when descending again to the cave. Rashbi and his son, on the other side, sit in their cave and study almost disembodied; thus they have to care for the body when re-entering civic life. Both the philosopher and the sage escape from the political world, but one into a space of confinement, the other leaves all spatial boundaries behind. The return of the philosopher/sage to the polis is in both tales a moment of crisis and danger, but whereas in Plato it is the philosopher who is in danger and risks to lose his new insights, Rashbi with his newly gained knowledge endangers the world outside; he has to return to the cave before he is able to use his knowledge of the Torah to the benefit of the world. Thus the whole story can be read as a talmudic inversion of the Platonic narrative); 297-316 Sarra Lev, How the 'Aylonit Got Her Sex (The 'aylonitzs described in t. Yebam. 10:7 does not fit any known ancient or modern condition, although some of the symptoms coincide with those of the Turner syndrome.

L. suggests that the 'aylonit is to be understood as the female counterpart to the congenital eunuch, as described in t.t. Yebam. 10:6. The aggregate signs of both are chosen specifically for their sex/ gender-crossing attributes. The 'aylonit has no ancient corollary in the Greek and Roman literature, but the attributes of the seris hammah match those of the Roman eunuch, who does appear in many contemporaneous Christian and Roman texts as a sex/gender crosser. It seems, therefore, that the aylonit receives her sex/gender from her mirror image, the seris hammah); 329-362 Stuart S. Miller, Review Essay: Roman Roman Imperialism, Jewish Self-Definition, and Rabbinic Society: Belayche's Iudaea Palaestina,Palaestina, Schwartz's Imperialism and Jewish Society, and Boyarin's Border Lines Reconsidered Reconsidered (In this far-ranging review essay, M. sees the three monographs as important part of the revisionist tendency in the historiography of Roman Pales tine and of the emergence of rabbinic Judaism. He greatly appreciates Belayche's nuanced approach to "paganization" and her careful evaluation of what the coin age has to teach about the religious landscape and the religious significance of everyday cult objects and statuettes. Although rather uncritical in the use of Jew ish evidence, she rightly understands Sepphoris and Tiberias as "cosmopolitan" towns in which Jews intermingled with pagans and eventually with Christians without any of them being radically transformed by this situation. As to Schwartz, M. accepts his position that the Jews between 135 and ca. 350 were no longer regarded by the Romans as a discrete category, but he has problems with his con elusion that the Jews participated like everyone else in pagan civic cults and life. By shunting the rabbis to the sidelines, Schwartz goes much too far in the oppo site direction of the rabbinocentric view he intends to counter and does not sufficiently exploit the evidence of the Yerushalmi. Schwartz postulates a recovery of Judaism in the 4th c., as documented above all by the emergence of monumen tal synagogues. But since in his view they are not to be connected with the rabbis, M. asks if we should think of these newly self-conscious Jews as the descendants of the "pagan" Jews of before. M. accepts that the theater and some villas in Sepphoris point to a pagan context, but would not deduce from them any conclu sions about the religious beliefs and practices of the Jews who lived in the city. The absence of pig bones on the western summit of the city, the stone vessels and stepped pools point to some concern with purity. M. also objects that Schwartz neglects the literary evidence of synagogues in 3rd-c. Sepphoris or the evidence of rabbinic interpretation of pagan symbols and rites. In general he is rather critical of Schwartz's thesis that the emergence of monumental synagogues is a reaction to similar developments in Christianity. Both may have been outgrowths of other cultural trends. "There was no implosion of Judaism followed by resuscitation in the wake of Christianization" [347]. Schwartz is unable, so M., "to imagine Jews being Jews within a pagan context" [350]. M. then proceeds to Boyarin whom he sees as dependent on Schwartz's understanding of "religion" as something which developed only with the Christianisation of the empire in the 4th c.

Ber. 28b-29a about the origins of the birkat ha-minim as a 4th- or 5th-c. "Babylonian talmudic story" or consider ing the story about the bat qol that the words of both Beit Shammai and Beit HillelHillel were the living words of God, as a stammaitic "Yavneh legend" in reaction to Christian orthodoxy. Other concepts, too, which Boyarin attributes to Babylo nian redaction, are already inherent in Palestinian tradition. M. is especially criti cal of Boyarin's presentation of a rabbinic logos theology and of his description of the rabbinic notion of minutas reacting to Christianity's challenge to Jewish iden tity.tity. Christianity is not at the basis of rabbinic Judaism, as M. summarizes Boya rin's position who "recreates the rabbis in the image of the church fathers" as theologians [360]).

It is argued that in many cases these can be explained as phonetic spellings that reflect aspects of the Aramaic spoken by the scribes. Support for this contention may be found in the better manuscripts of Babylonian Rabbinic literature, wherein such spellings are more frequently employed. The corrections of these forms in the magic bowls towards the historical spelling indicates the existence of a literary language in which at least some scribes aspired to write, not always successfully. Since these non-standard spellings provide rare evidence for the nature of the Aramaic spoken by these native scribes, and occasionally provide "missing links" of the history of Aramaic, the modern editors of the magic bowls must be wary of unnecessarily emending the texts they publish).

In the course of the polemics the role of Noah as the pioneer of animal sacrificial practice to whom God reveals the commandments about the blood becomes transferred to other characters of the story, including the miraculously born priest Melchizedek. Also the Epistle to the Hebrews might contain implicit polemics against Noah and his role as the originator of such practice. The author of Hebrews is openly engaged in polemics with the cultic prescriptions found in the law of Moses and perpetuated by the descendants of Levi. Yet the origin of animal sacrificial practice and the expiatory understanding of blood can be traced to the figure of Noah, who first performed animal sacrifices on the altar after his disembarkation and who received from God the commandment about the blood. By renouncing the practice of animal sacrifices and invalidating the expiatory significance of the animal blood through the sacrifice of Jesus, who in the Epistle to the Hebrews is associated with the figure of Melchizedek, the authors of the Epistle to the Hebrews appear to be standing in opposition not only to Moses and Levi, but also to Noah.

It is argued that the description comports well with the way the Messiah is portrayed elsewhere in 4 Ezra, that there are strong links between this eschato logical signs' passage and the visions of chapters 11-13, and that there is little evidence that an antichrist figure plays any role in the authors eschatological schema. The results of this study suggest that there is greater coherence between the dialogues and visions of 4 Ezra than has sometimes been recognized and that the Messiah of the book is not only an agent of judgment who brings in the end of the age but is also a king).

Some items typical of tannaitic Hebrew appear only rarely in amoraic texts, as for example מאחר ש; there are also clear differences in the use of תרע between tannaitic and Palestinian amoraic texts and the Bavli. Here most probably a shift took place in the beginning of the amoraic period. Where expressions are rare in tannaitic and common in amoraic Hebrew, as e.g. the expression כעלי חיים, the change may be dated towards the end of the tannaitic period. An example is the position of הרכה before the noun instead of after it as still common in tannaitic Hebrew. In other cases to be found both in tannaitic and amoraic Hebrew, there are differences already within the tannaitic period; normally Mishnah and Sifra stand together against other tannaitic texts, as e.g. מחוסר כיפורים instead of מחוסר כפרה or סכור against כסכור, typical also of the Bavli.

But since the Nazirites offerings were frequently brought long after the conclusion of one's term as a Nazirite, R. Eliezer saw the two components as inde pendent from each other. Later developments of this discussion can be found in Tosefta and Sifre and in the final layer of the Mishnah when the decisive point was found just at the beginning of the Temple ceremony as the point where both lines met); 81-87 Yoel Fixner and Hanan Eshel, Tearing Divorce Documents in Light of the of the Documents from the Judean Desert (There are five marriage contracts in Greek and three Aramaic ketubbot among the documents of the Judaean desert, but only one get.

Allowing the Aggada to Speak for Itself (Mai monides, as Philo or Saadia before him, struggled against traditional anthropo morphic concepts and preferred to portray God as a formless being. Against this approach, traditional talmudic culture always maintained the visual aspects of God. Akkadian texts compared the kings to gods. Genesis presented creation in the Divine image and thus democratized the concept from royal to universal. God banned carved or molded representations of his form, but accepted humanity itself for this function. Some texts as Deut 4:12 or Isa 40:18 are more cautious, but not because of philosophic anti-anthropomorphism. Many rabbinic texts accept an openly anthropomorphic stance. John 1:51-52 applies the biblical motif of the ladder of Jacob to the Son of Man. Possibly Ber. Rab. 68-69 on this scene and the likeness of Jacob on the heavenly throne is a rabbinic reaction to this Christian claim; Jacob represents the divine image; his icon is engraved on the divine throne, a motif found not only in classical midrashim, but also in Hekh. Rab.Rab. 9:2-3 and the Midrash of the Ten Martyrs. Not anthropomorphism, but the possibility to think of two Powers in heaven was problematic for the rabbis when interpreting the verse: "Let us make man"); 153-176 Reuven Kiperwasser, A Com parativeparative Study on the Midrashim on Ecclesiastes—On the Nature of Koheleth Zuta (A detailed comparison of Qoh.

There have been several attempts to explain the name. R. suggests that it refers to emperor Claudius, with full name Tiberius Claudius Drusus, on inscriptions frequently called Drusi Filius. Claudius issued an edict prohibiting the sale of cooked meat in order to prevent public gatherings. In order to circum vent the edict, street-vendors sold meat hastily cooked in the street. This food prepared in haste might have been named after the emperor responsible for the decree behind this custom).

The granting of foreknowledge was seen to imply the possibility that the punishment might be averted by the appropriate action, and Jewish and Christian scholars read intercession and/or the preaching of repentance into the three texts to a greater extent [particularly in the case of Noah] than the texts themselves warranted. T. examines on the Jewish side the interpretations offered in the Targums, Midrash and Talmud, and by mediaeval commentators, and on the Christian side those of the NT, the Fathers, Luther and Calvin. She notes that the interpretations are broadly similar, but that there is a tendency on the Jewish side to emphasize the motif of intercession, and on the Christian that of human repentance).

This hope is expressed since after the Bar Kokhba-revolt. It sees attacks on Israel as attacks on God himself; he will take action, thus denying legitimacy to human action. It is a message of hope, at the same time contributing to an ideology of political passivity); 91-93 Bilhah Nitzan, Are There Two Historical Layers Layers in lQPesher Habakkuk?

Eshel in Zion 71 [2006]: 143-52, that an earlier layer of lQpHab reflects the time of the Teacher of Righteousness, a later one the period after Pompey's conquest of Jerusalem, that the pesher is a literary unity, as may be seen from its systematic interpretation of different prophecies, distinguishing clearly between words of the prophet on internal matters and such which are external threats against Judah. It must have been written either when the Roman threat was already real or after Pompey); 94-96 Hanan Eshel, Response to Bilhah Nitzan (Maintains that Nitzan's distinc tion is not always clear, e.g. on Hab 1:14-17 and on 2:5.

The early rabbis also know both aspects of impurity, but ascribe a biblical basis only to ritual purity whereas their own strict purity rules for daily life are never based on biblical texts, but only on halakhic traditions. In their interpretation of biblical laws they restrict ritual purity whereas in halakhic prac tice they expand the laws of purity to the profane. This duality does not reflect inner-Pharisaic disputes in this matter, as claimed by G. Alon and others. The halakhic midrashim reveal in this field no disputes between the schools of Aqiba and Yishmael; their common approach seems to go back to the beginnings of halakhic midrash and to the early Pharisees); 265-299 Amram Tropper, On the History History of the Father's Obligation to Maintain His Children in Ancient Jewish Law (The Bible contains no legal obligations regarding the maintenance of children nor do we have explicit texts on the topic in Second Temple Judaism, m.

Ketub. 4:8 extends the obligation to sons as well; whether it is a moral or a legal obligation is not clear since m. Ketub.Ketub. 4:6 states that the father is not obliged.
