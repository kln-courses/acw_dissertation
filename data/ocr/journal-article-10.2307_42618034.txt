As an acquisition for a leading public collection it deserves every praise. It is a major masterpiece of his maturity, in fine condition, and one of the best documented of all his works (Fig. 1). The painting is unsigned and undated: but the lower right-hand corner of it is represented hanging high on the left wall in Jan Bruegel's Allegory of Sight, which is dated 1617;2 and it is undoubtedly the picture listed second of twelve items offered by Rubens to Sir Dudley Carleton in his letter of 28th April the following year: "Daniel amongst many lions, taken from life. Original entirely by my hand. 8 x 12 ft."3 Carleton had been resident at The Hague since 1615, as Ambassador of James I of Great Britain to the Confederate States. He had brought with him from Italy, his previous diplomatic post having been Venice, a collection of antique marbles. Rubens coveted these for his domestic Pantheon; and, now that he was established as a painter of European fame, grand style , he was eager to treat for them without even seeing a list of exactly what was offered. After three weeks of negotiations these two collectors struck their bargain. Carleton took from Rubens 2,000 florins in cash for the purchase of Brussels tapestries, and 4,000 florins' worth of the artist's own pictures, 3,000 of which was accounted for by the six unalloyed originals selected Michael Jaffé is Head of the Department of the History of Art at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of King's College. 7 from the list on offer at the end of April - including the Daniel valued by Rubens at 600. So for the agreed sum of 6,000 florins Rubens got the marbles. From his letter to Carleton of May 20 we know that all six masterpieces of his painting were on canvas and ready to be rolled for shipment within a matter of days; and on June 1 the pictures were delivered to Frans Pieterssen who was to effect the exchange.4 Carleton, as an understood part of his duties, acted as a buying agent for the gallery of King James' second son, Charles, Prince of Whales, the young man whom Rubens was to name to Valavez as "le prince le plus amateur de la peinture qui soit au monde." 5 In the early summer of 1618 Rubens was represented in the Prince's Gallery only by a Judith and Holofernes in a style which he himself had long since outmoded.6 Charles would soon have heard of Carleton's success in obtaining such a spectacular group of up-to-date originals. In 1621 Carleton, on his behalf, got Rubens to paint a Lion Hunt, although he omitted to offer the cash price of a pure original, or to reveal to the painter the august destination intended. This British parsimony and reticence led to embarrassment, since Charles refused to accept from Rubens "a peece scarce touched by his own hand."7 However, his appetite to own something worthy of the painter's repu- tation was only whetted sharper. And Carleton, at The Hague until 1625 and later in Paris, remained in Charles' trust, being created Viscount Dorchester in 1628 and soon afterwards Secretary of State. Then, or sometime before his death in 1632, the former ambassador may have pre- sented the Daniel to his royal master. At any rate the picture appears in the catalogue drawn up by Van der Doort for Charles I about 1639.8 By 1643 ownership had been transferred to another of the Whitehall group of painting</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2.

The Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London. enthusiasts, the Marquess of Hamilton.9 For it is named in a Hamilton Palace inventory of pictures which were rolled up in cases at the outset of the Civil War.10 From then it remained one of the famous treasures of that house until the sale of 1882. After one further ownership it was bought back for the 13th Duke of Hamilton. In 1919 it was in the second Hamilton Palace sale at Christie's, after which it disappeared from view until it was sent once again to be auctioned in London on 1 August 196 3. 11 The picture was then the property of the 3rd Viscount Cowdray by inheritance from his grandfather; and it was bought by Mr. Julius Weitzner before the day fixed for viewing the sale, Mr. Weitzner having particular interest in large paintings of Biblical subjects. The National Gallery of Art eventually acquired the picture in 1965. The subject, hitherto a comparatively rare one for painters,12 illustrates Daniel 6: 10-22. Rubens harnessed his creative imagination to the service of the text in a way which owes nothing to any previous depiction of the prophet's predicaments. King Darius, after a sleepless night, had hastened "very early in the morning" to the den of lions. 8 Rubens was at pains to show the pale blue grey light of dawn filtering through the mouth of the den onto Daniel. Daniel, envisaged as a heroically proportioned youth, is seated on a drapery of carefully subdued red, the only strong area of local color in the whole picture. The eyes of three of the ten lions are still closed in sleep. The mouths of four more remain shut ( "My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me," is Daniel's reply to Darius) : whilst another bares his fangs in a fearsome yawn; and the remaining pair are sufficiently roused to snarl at each other as they prowl in opposite directions past the grisly remains of a man whom God did not protect. But none are in a posture to attack. None menace Daniel directly. The cool illumination is subtly treated by Rubens to display the maximum variety of texture and temperament in the tawny presences which surround the human figure and emphasize his solitude; so subtly that one is not at first aware of both the sleepers at the mouth of the inner den at the left. He controls it optically by skillful use of a pale gray priming. In many passages this preparation remains uncovered or scarcely covered by his surface effects. The unmis-</page><page sequence="4">takable mark of his own handling is a masterly economy of paint and unmatched fluency of touch as his brush moves rapidly over the vast stretch of canvas. The turgid opacity of passages in other paintings where he employed trained assistants for setting out forms and laying in color is happily absent. Accents of green and of grayish mauve, as well as rose and orange and red, quicken the interplay of cool and warm, vitalizing the entire picture. His feeling for the temperature of light and for the physical expression of Daniel's renewed crisis of spirit transmogrifies a virtuoso performance into a moving work of religious art. We do not know of any particular patron for whom the Daniel might have been intended. Rubens may have painted it primarily for his own satisfaction, as a subject to challenge the employment of a group of his lion studies. Its availability at his house in the spring of 1618 need not imply that it was painted as a commission for some client who rejected it. Nor do we know how long the notion of it had been in the painter s mind. However there is external evidence, a small painting of Noah and His Family Leading the Animals into the Ark (Fig. 2), signed and dated by Jan Bruegel 1615, to show that studies at any rate for one lioness and one lion were extant by that year.13 The handsome studies drawn specifically for the Daniel of this lioness and of this lion both survive, and may be dated 1614-15; the former long celebrated in the British Museum (Fig. 3);14 and the latter, recently acquired in London for the National Gallery of Art, is published here for the first time (Fig. 4) .15 Of the two, the British Museum Lioness is the more highly finished, a real show piece, certainly not sketched directly from nature as it was once thought to be.16 The life drawings on which it is based, in reverse, belongs to the Rijksprentenkabinet in Amsterdam ( Fig. 5 ) .17 Comparison shows how Rubens, once he had determined the place of this beast at the lower right corner of his composition, modified the angle and the displacement of the rearmost leg, effecting a somewhat unnatural although decidedly impressive shift in the whole pondération. The British Museum Lioness appears perhaps more formidable, but certainly less lithe and dynamic than the Lioness in Amsterdam; and her tail is restyled into a stiff bow of anger, instead of the tenser and suppler tail observed in the beast retreating across her cage in the Archducal menagerie at Brussels. o Figure 3. Rubens, Study of a Lioness. British Museum, London. The confidence and skill to attempt at the necessary speed a coherent record of this dauntingly difficult view of a wild beast in action came to Rubens from intensive study of Paduan bronzes designed all'antica. A sheet of paper on which he penned at least four such studies survives, although the two parts of what remains are separated: the lower part in the Kupferstichkabinett at Berlin (Fig. 6), 18 the upper at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (Fig. 7). 19 On each part of this irregularly divided sheet are studies from two poses of different bronzetti : but on the Berlin fragment he has reversed the post at the left by use of a mirror. Confrontation with two actual bronzes ( Fig. 8 ) of panthers of the type studied on the Berlin fragment indicate his power to invest inanimate sculpture with startling ferocity.20 In gathering thus the visual knowledge which he sought, he may have been guided as a young man in Italy by the example of Agostino Carracci whom he admired. The comparison of his drawing with one penned by Agostino (Fig. 9) from a similar bronze panther emphasizes the life-enhancing</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Rubens, A Lion.

British Museum, London. 13 strength of his own approach.21 How potent was the interfusion of learning and observation which enabled him to bring off the brilliant sketch in Amsterdam! We may also note how he sometimes relished visual knowledge for its own sake by regarding a drawing resplendent in sanguine of a Crouching Lioness (Fig. 10). 22 It was worked up presumably after another vigorous study in pen of a bronze, like those of the same bronze on the fragment in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and perhaps originally a part of that same sheet. This finished study in chalks does not appear to have been used, nor to have been intended for use in any painting. Conceivably the Lion study now in Washington, since the stance could be held for several minutes, might have been started face to face with the beast, and then worked up to the required finish in the studio. At any rate no separate sketch from life for this lion has come to light. The case is surely different with the well-known Lion in the British Museum (Fig. II).23 For this Rubens combined two of his sketches from life. One, belonging to Mr. Paul Wallraf, shows how Rubens first caught the mask frontally, as in the Washington drawing, before he discovered the immensely dignified three- quarters view which displays the mane to best advantage (Fig. 12). 24 The vigorous summary of the mane and beard and other features in the Wallraf drawing makes a striking contrast to the elaborate coiffure and more stylized contours of the finished studies at the British Museum and in Washington. Furthermore at the upper left corner of the Wallraf sheet we can see how Rubens hand and eye were diverted for a fleeting moment to the chance of catching the action of a lioness in retreat. There were doubtless other such attempts before he achieved the dazzling success of the Amsterdam sketch. The other sketch from life used for the British Museum study was, like the Wallraf drawing, formerly in the collection of Victor Koch (Fig. 13) 25 This provided the basis for the tail and quarters. Rubens simply cleared the tail of the hind leg and gave it extra length and elegance of line in his definitive study for the painting. The head and foreparts of the beast, as he sketched them, were easily adapted to the neighboring lion which snoozes undisturbed by the touch of Daniels left toe. Just as in working up the information in the Wallraf sketch for the British Museum study Rubens twisted the lion's head a trifle more towards us, so he made a comparable dis- placement of the head of the sleeping lion in order to resolve its precise set in the composition.</page><page sequence="9">Figure 12.

Rubens, St. Jerome (detail). Julius Weitzner, London. Figure 17. Rubens, St. Jerome (detail). Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden. 16 For the lion which is paired with the lioness at the right of the Daniel no finished study is known: but the set of his head, shoulders, and forepaws is manifestly based on a sketch of a lioness, which was last seen, like the drawing just discussed, in the collection of Victor Koch (Fig. 14). 26 This is as uningratiating an impres- sion of a brute disturbed as one could hope to find; and it is hardly surprising that Rubens only used a part of it in his painting. Moreover the curious uncertainty there as to what may be understood of the action of the hindquarters is explicable in terms of his having not only tampered with the beast's sex but abandoned the observed deport- ment of the belly, paws, and cringing haunches. The appalling hatred which distorts the mask of the lioness which he drew is reflected in the almost audible snarl of the lion which she becomes; and this itself reflects the experience of the right- hand study on the Victoria and Albert Museum fragment of the sheet of pen drawings from bronzetti. That study would have been vivid in his mind when he was preparing the figure for the painting. He could not induce a captive lion or lioness to adopt the pose of the bronze, or anything closer to that than the Koch sketch of the lioness. So he worked of necessity from an incomplete revision, the reward of patience and observation, of knowledge gained ten years earlier in Italy. A much easier task, even though unguided by any sixteenth-century bronze, was to draw a caged lion asleep. The Schaeffer Galleries in New York own his sketch of a lion, of which the head only, resting on the right forepaw in the revised posi- tion (Fig. 15), 27 was introduced in the compo- sition of the Daniel. There it is partially hidden by the mane of the lion which stands in profile at the extreme left. However the head from this same sketch appears to have been used with a fresh position for the paws in the modello (Fig. 16) 28 painted by Rubens for his penitent St. Jerome and with still further modifications in his full-scale execution of that (Fig. 17) 29 Since the penitent St. Jerome has generally been agreed to have been painted c.1615, there is some reinforcement of opinion for dating the whole group of chalk drawings of lions and lionesses 1614-15. That of course would have to go for such sketches from life or more finished studies as Rubens may have used for the three remaining lions and the second lioness in the Daniel. Not only the brute beasts were cavati dal naturale, but the protagonist himself. The major portion of the study drawn by Rubens from the human</page><page sequence="12">Figure 18. Rubens, Daniel. Pierpont Morgan Library, New York. model is preserved in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Fig. 18). 30 The painting follows this superb drawing in all essentials: only the auburn hair is made to grow longer and thicker, and the lips are parted in a more idealized ecstasy. The whole conception of the figure anticipates by decades the triumphs of Bernini. Rubens most likely took the direct suggestion for posing the man from one of the chalk drawings by Girolamo Muziano in his own collection; a life study (Fig. 19) 31 for the Penitent St. Jerome in Bologna, an altarpiece which he would also have known during his Italian years. The ultimate inspiration to draw raised forearms with clasped hands as an expressive feature of a male nude lay also in his remarkable collection: on the sheet drawn by Michelangelo which Sebastiano del Piombo was able to use for his Volterra Lamentation?2 It is no mere chance that Rubens invested his Daniel with the physique and something of the inner tension of a Sistine Chapel ignudo. For on the other side of that same Michelangelo drawing of his is a magnificent study in sanguine for one of these superhuman youths.33 His own composition, 17 Figure 19. Girolamo Muziano, Study for the Penitent St. Jerome. Louvre, Paris. unified by the physical and spiritual tensions within Daniel, is fraught with the drama of miraculous deliverance. At a stage between the sketches from life and the definitive studies for the lions and lionesses, Rubens is very likely to have painted an oil sketch for the whole deployment of the figures, which pivoted on some adumbration of the pose of Daniel.34 That would have accorded with his habit in Flanders to project the coherence of such a complex design. This design in its final form was widely promulgated through copies35 and prints,36 none alas of a quality worthy of the painting. Yet if nobody could match the narrative and dramatic power of Rubens' composition, the decorative possibilities of his pride of lions were seized readily, not only by Jan Bruegel. Taken from the tenebrous enclosure of their den they were re-assorted in fresh adaptations on walls as far apart in time and place as the Oranjesaal of the Huis ten Bosch outside The Hague ( Figs. 20, 21 )37 and the saloon of the Tiepolo villa at Zianigo.38 The lion which accompanies Watteau's</page><page sequence="13">Figure 20. Theodore van Thulden, after Rubens, Lions. Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna. Ceres is a reminiscence.39 Early in the nineteenth century they attracted the attention, and the pungent criticism of Thomas Landseer.40 This monumental aspect was in the mind of Landseer s son, Edwin, when he chiselled away at the huge lions which were to guard the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. The grandeur of conception in Rubens' painting, and the splendor of its execution, remain eloquent for those whose eyes are ready to learn his language. Rubens was fascinated by the ferocious strength of lions. An eager researcher into comparative physiognomy, he found in the head of the Farnese Hercules the paradigm of leonine and taurine qualities combined in the heroic strength of a man. His lions, as they confront us in the Daniel , are cavati dal naturale: but, though idealizations, they are rendered appropriately fabulous, not just zoomorphic; and they seem to have assumed 18 by exchange something human in their appearance. When we sense a dignified frown or a baleful glare as almost anthropomorphic, we acknowledge that affinity of the nobler beasts and man, an aspect of the underlying unity of all creation, which to Rubens was a matter of belief. He had a taste for the ideas of comparative physiognomy which stem from the pseudo- Aristotle, Polemon, Ademantios, and the pseudo- Apuleius, as they were first given the force of illustration in late sixteenth-century Naples by Giovanni Battista della Porta. He was aware that the prodigiously popular De Humana Physiognomia gave a new style of presentation to an ancient tradition in natural philosophy.41 So when he drew from sixteenth-century bronze panthers he was aware of these desk ornaments as recreations of the antique models which survived in small bronzes,42 and of the types which he scrutinized also in jewels 43 and in the marble bas-reliefs of sarcophagi.</page><page sequence="14">Figure 21.

Another manifestation of his passionate addiction to all the relics of antiquity is his painting tradi- tionally called Tiberius and Agrippina (Fig. 2 3), 44 acquired by the National Gallery of Art from the Liechtenstein Collection. These superimposed profiles of an imperial couple present in a magni- fied image the sharp cutting and delicately graded relief of a Roman cameo. At the same time Rubens has imparted by his brush the palpitation and translucency of young flesh and blood to what was glyptic and unyielding. His exceptional gift to do so was developed first in Rome through his admiration for the life-enhancing achievement in this kind of Annibale Carracci.45 Rubens probably had his prime thrill of handling an important cameo at Mantua, during his service to Vincenzo I Gonzaga. On 9 Sep- tember 1627 he wrote to his correspondent in Paris, Pierre Dupuy, who shared his antiquarian enthusiasms: "I received with pleasure the design (although badly done) of the cameo of Mantua. I have seen it several times, and have even held it in my hands, when I was in the service of Duke Vincenzo, father of the present Duke. I believe that among cameos with two heads it is the most beautiful piece in Europe." 46 He wrote this after he had been working for 21 Figure 25. Rubens, Tiberius and Agrippina. William Hayes Ackland Memorial Art Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. some years on the project of a Cameo Book to illustrate the finest pieces of European collections. About 1614, five years before his first contact with Nicolas-Claude-Fabri de Peiresc, the renowned antiquary who was to have written the text of this book, "the cameo of Mantua" surely had no rival in his experience. The Gonzaga Ptolemy Philadelphos and Arsinöe (Fig. 24) 47 would have been clear in his memory when, having first painted on his panel an idealized female head in profile, he decided to enlarge the field of his panel at the left by an upright strip of oak, in order to include a male profile and show both capita jugata. This development of intention involved balancing the man's head by an arabesque of hair, postiché to the woman's original coiffure, and it involved the provision of a secure base line by an even stranger addition of a painted parapet simulating black marble, which masks the lower curve of the woman's bust. Aesthetically no room was left to give the man a myrtle wreath or any other mark of rank. From the point of view of any seventeenth- century painter of such passionate scholarship as Rubens the effect must have been curious, supremely because the woman's profile is super- imposed on the man's. Very soon he must have</page><page sequence="17">Figure 26. Here attributed to Jordaens, Portrait of a Man.

National Gallery of Art, Washington, Gift of Adolph Caspar Miller. determined to try the problem again with his intentions resolved at the outset. The result of this second trial, a splendid revision of the first, was acquired eight years ago by the University of North Carolina (Fig. 25 ) .48 The oval form of the painting now at Chapel Hill is a much happier solution to the setting of the "cameo" presentation of the couple; and generally it has a more considered air. Nothing however can surpass the luminous refinement of the earlier version at Washington, nor its free and liquid handling. Even the solemnity of the feigned parapet is relieved by Rubens' use of the wooden end of his brush in order to "vein" it. II Jacob Jordaens The National Gallery has recently acquired its first two works by Jordaens. The earlier of these, a gift, is a Portrait of a Man (Fig. 26) ,49 painted in oils on paper, which was subsequently enlarged on all sides by mounting on a panel in order to create a supposedly more impressive effect as a portrait. The attribution hitherto to van Dyck cannot be satisfactorily sustained by comparison with any known work of that painter. The frontality of pose, the angularities in the mod- eling, the casting of the eyes, and the vigorous handling of oil paint on paper are all characteristic however of Jordaens c.1620. Jordaens used the 23 same young man as his model for his St. John the Baptist in Youth painted on a panel now at Groningen (Fig. 28) .50 The lips are parted in the more finished painting, and the head tilted: but the features and coloring are a convincing match. Allowing for the slight differences in the application of paint due to the different support used for the Washington head study and the Groningen St. John the Baptist, these two works seem to be very close in date. Rather more idealized interpretations of the same model appear as the angel staying the hand of Abraham from The Sacrifice of Isaac, in the Brera, and as the youthful shepherd in the Mainz Adoration of the Shepherds, both works of the same period of Jordaens activity.51 This year the Gallery bought a painting which was intended by Jordaens as a portrait in full form, of an unidentified young man in a broad-brimmed hat and slashed doublet (Fig. 29). 52 In the Jordaens exhibition mounted at the National Gallery of Canada from November 1968 to January 1969, this three-quarter length hung between two other portraits unmistakably by the same masterly hand: A Young Man Standing beside His Wife, lent by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and Joannes de Marschalk in His Eleventh Year, lent by the Nelson Gallery- Atkins Museum, Kansas City.53 In all three there are remarkable congruencies in the manipulation of light ( including the use of a thin coverage of the panels to give luminosity in the half tones) , in the fullness and firmness of the modeling, and in the loose and luminous treatment of landscape backgrounds. But the closest affinity in tonality, in the bravura of rumpled draperies, and even in the manner of posing a single figure, are between the Washington portrait and the Kansas City portrait, dated 1624. The Washington portrait cannot have been painted far from that year. The attribution of it to Jordaens has been confirmed by the discovery, through infrared photography, of a characteristically abbreviated signature jo.f., more or less concealed in the background at the extreme right, together with the inscription 21 , which is more likely to refer to the sitter s age than the date. The view of sunset landscape reflects the superbly romantic mood of the whole portrayal. It is as vital an element as the noble melancholy in the gaze of the brown eyes; as the swagger in the mauve hangings, and as the aristocratic restraint of the study in lambent blacks and creamy whites of the clothes. There is a suffusion</page><page sequence="19">Figure 28. Jordaens, St. John the Baptist. Groninger Museum voor Stad en Lande, Groningen. 24</page><page sequence="20">Figure 29.

The picture ranks with van Dyck's Frans Sny der s in the Frick Collection54 as one of the half-dozen finest male portraits painted in Antwerp during the first quarter of the seventeenth century, the work of Rubens himself not being regarded as hors de concours ! Ill Anthony van Dyck The National Gallery has not acquired in recent years any painting by van Dyck. But this is a suitable occasion to publish a small painting in the National Collection of Fine Arts which is directly connected with the most superb of the incomparable array of his Genoese portraits owned by the National Gallery: a head study for the portrait of Marchesa Elena Grimaldi-Cattaneo (Fig. 30). 55 Until two years ago, when I -had the opportunity in Washington of inspecting this in its then deplorably overpainted state, it had been assumed to be an old copy after the head and ruff in the magnificent painting of this noblewoman, whom van Dyck portrayed issuing from the portico of her villa at Sampierdarena onto the terrace, her complexion shaded by a parasol in the hands of her Negro page (Fig. 31 ) .56 However, cleaning last year at the National Collection confirmed my impression that it was a somewhat damaged original by van Dyck's own hand, painted from the lady herself at one or two sittings, in preparation for the elaborate full-length whose composition he had determined in the main by the brush and ink sketch in the Home collection (Fig. 32) ;57 and it belongs in character and style to the group of head studies, recently published, which he painted of members of the Genoese patriciate.58 He was evidently pleased that, when the Marchesa Elena sat for him, she wore in her auburn hair, forward of her right ear, a flower of bright vermilion to set off her splendid coloring. Nevertheless, when he chose to paint the tense silk of her parasol close to the same hue, he painted out this hair ornament as superfluous and ineffective from the spectator's eye level far below. A pentimento in the large painting tells the tale of this change, and proves beyond dispute the priority of the head study. It is a happy coincidence that both paintings are so easily available for comparison. Possibly connected with the painting out of the flower in the Marchesa's 26 hair is the decision in the finished portrait to set a flower in her right hand in place of the fan which she holds in the composition trial. The Marchesa Elena Grimaldi-Cattaneo , one of the triumphs of baroque portraiture, shows how van Dyck's youthful imagination was fired in Genoa not only by the splendor of the subject but by the example of what Rubens had painted for the Genoese palaces about fifteen years earlier, notably the portrait of the Marchesa Brigida Spinola Doria standing on her terrace of which the surviving part belongs to the National Gallery (Fig. 33) .59 His working procedure in tackling the problem was inherited from the older master: a small sketch in ink of the composition; a head study painted of the actual sitter, who was too impatient or too grand to stand long hours for her portrait; and finally the full-scale execution. By good fortune all three stages survive of van Dyck's portrayal of at least one of the beautiful ladies of that merchant republic where both he and Rubens as Antwerp gentlemen felt so ideally, so luxuriously at home.</page><page sequence="22">Figure 30.

For the 1882 sale catalogue measurements were given as 7'6" x IO'IO"; in 1885, 7'6 "x 9'10" (a clerical error); in 1919, 77" x IO'IO"; in 1963, 7'5" x IO'IO". 4 Ibid., Letter 30, p. 63, and Letter 34, p. 67. 5 Ibid., Letter 60, p. 101 (quoted here in the original language) . 6 Ibid., Letter 46, pp. 77, 446, note 2. 7 Ibid., p. 446, note 1. 8 The measurements then given were 7 '4" x 10'8". These were repeated in Bathoe's catalogue, published by George Vertue, London, 1757. See note 2 above. 9 Hamilton had already obtained a Lion Hunt from Rubens through Sir John Digby, British Ambassador at Brussels: see Magurn, op.cit., Letter 46, pp. 77, 446, note 3. The Hamilton Inventory for 1624 includes "a chasse of lions". 10 Item 2 in Case 26. The Marquisate of Hamilton was raised to a Dukedom in 1643. The Inventory may be dated close to that year ( so I am kindly informed by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, who allowed me to examine a copy) ; because the van Dyck portrait of Hamilton is referred to as that of "My Lord Marquis"; and another picture is described as the bequest of "My Lord Denbigh", presumably the 1st Earl, who was killed in the wars of that year. 11 "Important Old and Modern Pictures" to be sold by Bonham's, 1 August 1963, lot 25 repr., as by "Jordaens and Snyders". At no previous time had the painting been regarded as by any other master than Rubens. The Bonham's cataloguer, Mr. Lawson, gave his fresh and untenable attribution despite notice in his catalogue entry of the label of the R. A. (London) Exhibition of 1873 on the back of the canvas, and the provenance from Hamilton Palace. 12 A. Pigler, Barockthemen, vol. I, Budapest, 1956, pp. 216-218. 13 M.

A pentimento is visible on the lion's right foreleg. The drawing, to which Mr. Douglas Stewart kindly called my attention, was bought c. 1930 (without specific attribution) in a mixed lot at Sotheby's by his father-in-law to be, Mr. George Fenwick-Owen, of Lether Melton, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, a big game hunter. It was sold by his wife, Mrs. Denise Fenwick-Owen, London (Sotheby's), 27 March 1969 (86), bought Agnew's. The Sotheby catalogue ignores the late eighteenth-century provenance: Marquis de Gouvernet (sale, Paris, 6-10 Nov. 1775); Conseiller Nourri (sale, Paris, 24 Feb. - 14 Mar. 1785); Conseiller de St. Maurice (sale, Paris, 1 Feb. 1786). 18 e.g. G.

Inscribed on the mount, pen, Cabinet de Crozat Augustin Catrache 782, by Count C. G. Tessin. The inclusion by Agostino in his drawing of the base, and of the shoulder harness on the panther, leaves no doubt that he was drawing from a bronzetto. A similar one, without the base, is illustrated by W. von Bode, The Italian Bronze Statuettes of the Renaissance, London, 1908, vol. I, pl. CXIX. I am grateful to Mr. Per Bjurström for permission to publish this drawing. 22 van Hasselt, loc. cit., no. 34.

See also Carlos van Hasselt, T ekeningen uit vier eeuwen 30</page><page sequence="26">uit de V erzamelin g van Sir Bruce en Lady Ingram, Rotterdam, 1961, no. 74, where the drawing is dated pre 1615-18, i.e. before the studies for the Daniel. See also note 19 above. 23 Glück-Haberditzl, op. cit., no. 98, as "Naturstudie eines ruhenden Löwen." According to Held, op. cit., p. 131 (under no. 83), also this drawing "may well be such a study from life". Although it may seem to be more nearly matched to life than, for example, the lion studies penned by Dürer in Venice, and it is indeed based on two sketches from life, it is not itself a life study. An unpublished copy of it is in the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Darmstadt, AE 558, in black grease crayon and white chalk on blue paper, 190 x 268 mm. Inscribed P.S. red chalk ( ? F. Snyders ) . From the Lagoy Collection. A more important copy of it was published as Rubens by M. Rooses, L'Oeuvre de P. P. Rubens, Antwerp, 1886-92, vol. V, no. 1427: Albertina no. 8377, sanguine on white paper, 260 x 355 mm., inscribed in ink Opus manu pro: Petri Pauli Ribenii. Rooses subsequently ( Rubens-Bulletijn , IV, 1896, p. 293 ) recognized this Albertina drawing to be a copy of the original in the British Museum. The Albertina drawing (Fig. 21) is a copy by Jordaens, typical of his figure style in chalks c. 1615-20; cf. M. Jafïé, Jordaens, The National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1968, nos. 134, 135. 24 Mr. Paul Wallraf, London. Black chalk on white paper, 250 x 410 mm.

In his review of this exhibition F. Baudouin, Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Bulletin, Brussels, No. 2, June 1953, p. 53, stated his doubts of the authenticity of this drawing, without giving his reason. L. Burchard and R.-A. d'Hulst, Rubens Drawings, Brussels, 1963, p. 176 (under no. 110), support the attribution to Rubens of the three drawings formerly in the Koch collection and of the fourth formerly in the Oppé collection (see note 26 below). J. Müller Hofstede, Master Drawings, vol. IV, p. 450, reviewing Burchard-d'Hulst, calls the Koch drawings "rather poor works by pupils. One of these drawings, black chalk 250 x 400 mm., now in a private collection in London, is a copy after Glück-Haberditzl, no. 98." This is the Wallraf drawing. It cannot be any sort of a pupil's copy after the British Museum drawing, for which it was used as a basis. ( For two copies, see note 23 above.) 25 Private collection, U. S. A.

Oil on oak panel, 106 x 76 cm. Major T. F. Trollope-Bellew sale, London (Sotheby's), 22 Feb. 1967, lot 7, as Rubens, bought Weitzner. J. Müller Hofstede, Pantheon, vol. XXV, 1967, pp. 440-442, figs. 7, 8, 11, anticipated my publication of this modello, which was successfully cleaned after the London auction by Mr. Herbert Lank. 29 R. Oldenbourg, ed., Rubens, Klassiker der Kunst, Stuttgart, 1921, p. 97 right. It has not been remarked that Rubens based this design, in reverse, on Agostino Carracci's etching of the subject (A. Bartsch, Le peintre- graveur, Vienna, 1821, vol. XVIII, pp. 75, 77, no. 75). 30 Burchard-d'Hulst, op. cit., p. 176, no. 110. These authorities disregard the study by Muziano in Rubens' collection for the Penitent St. Jerome, discussed by Jafïé, loc. cit., 1955, pp. 59-67, fig. 10, preferring to call attention to the Christ Seated in bronze by Adriaen de Vries of 1607, by which Rubens might have been inspired. The resemblance and possible connection of this sculptured figure, however, are distinctly less close (see Tietze-Conrat, Die Bronzen der Fürstlich Liechtensteinsche Kunstkammer, Vienna, 1918, p. 43, pl. 31). Held, op. cit., p. 132, under no. 85, writes, in support of my suggestion. 31 Jafïé, loc. cit., 1955, pp. 59-67, fig. 10; and Master Drawings, vol. II, 1964, p. 384, pl. 10. The fame of Muziano's painting of the Penitent St. Jerome is attested by a careful drawing after it (? by Cornelis Cort) , cf. Jafïé, loc. cit., 1955, p. 66, fig. 9, squared for transfer to a copper plate although apparently not engraved : Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 94.113 (gift of Quincy Adams Shaw), black chalk with brown wash, 365 x 231 mm., as Italian School, "Hermit adoring a Crucifix". I am grateful to Miss Eleanor Sayre for permission to publish this hitherto unidentified drawing. 32 Jafïé, loc. cit., 1964, p. 385, pl. 14a. 33 Ibid., pl. 14b. 34 No such oil sketch for the Daniel is known today. But a painting, 18 x 25VŽ in., classed as "a finished sketch" was in a sale, London (Christie's), 28 June 1890, bought Sir William Farrer. Exhibited New Gallery, London, 1899, by him, as Rubens: see M. Rooses, Rubens-Bulletijn, V, Antwerp, 1910, p. 286. Sold by his grandson C. W. Oxley Parker, London (Sotheby's) , 18 February 1953 (146), bought H. Terry-Engell. It may reflect the missing oil sketch. Unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to study this painting. 35 The best known contemporary copy is in the church at Godshill, Isle of Wight, presented in the early 17th century by the Earl of Yarborough, his Countess being niece and heir to Sir Richard Worsley Bt., of Appeldurcomb (I.o.W.). This Worsley had inherited the picture from his father, Sir Thomas Worsley: see M. Rooses, Rubens-Bulletijn, I, Antwerp, 1882, p. 260, who reports that the auctioneer's suddenly expressed doubt, whether the Godshill or the Hamilton Palace painting was the original, caused the representatives of the National Gallery to change their mind about bidding for the Hamilton picture; and The Times, 1882, June 13, and 19, and letter of July 1 from the Rev. Thos. Radcliffe, Godshill Vicarage, I.o.W. An inferior copy of that remains in the inn at Hovingham, where Sir Thomas Worsley built his Yorkshire seat. Another version, untraced, was amongst the thirty-one paintings attributed to Rubens in the collection of the Marqués de Léganès at Madrid in 1655: "325. Un Daniel en la cueva con los lionês y en el medio orando, de mano de Rubens, de 2 vs* de alto y poco mas de una y sesma de ancho"; see Rooses, loc. cit., V, 1900, p. 170. Mr. J. Woodward signalled a copy of the original on the staircase at Melville Hall, Fife; H. G. Evers, Rubens und sein Werk, Brussels, 1944, p. 375, another in the 31</page><page sequence="27">collection of Eugen Abresch, Neustadt an der Weinstrasse ( Rheinpfalz ) ; another was the property of Mrs. Roper-Lumley-Holland, Lynstead Park, Kent, offered London (Sotheby's) 6 July 1927 (82) and withdrawn (canvas, 84 x 135 in.); and yet another (?) was London (Christie's) 20 July 1934 (66), bought S. Hartveld. Various variants have been claimed as originals by Rubens, e.g. The Star, 20 Jan. 1925, repr., and Toronto Daily Mail and Empire, 6 Jan. 1925; Christian Science Monitor , 6 Jan. 1935, reputedly bought for "a few marks" at an auction in Frankfurt/Main, 1908, by Max A. Kraustel, Philadelphia ( expertise by Prof. Pasquale Farina) , which appears to be a copy of the picture by the "Vienna Daniel painter", as was another sold Brussels (Palais des Beaux-Arts) 26 Apr. 1954 (325), 51 x 69 cm. (photo Netherlands Art Institute, L. no. 17825 ) . I am indebted to the researches of Mr. Frank Simpson for information about these paintings which came to light at sales. For the "Vienna Daniel Painter", see R. Wilenski, Flemish Painters 1430-1800, London, I960, vol. II, pl. 526. 38 The least bad of the prints after the Daniel is the etching by Willem de Leeuw (G. C. Vorhelm Schneevogt, Catalogue des Estampes Gravées d'après P. P. Rubens, Haarlem, 1873, p. 9, 72), almost certainly made after Rubens' death, and without his supervision, probably from a copy of the painting rather than the original: see also F. van den Wijngaert, Inventaris der Rubeniaanche Prentkunst, Antwerp, 1940, no. 390. Vorhelm Schneevogt, loc. cit., nos. 73-77 , lists also the rare etching by R. Strieker (B. 31) ; an anonymous engraving (probably the most influential of these reproductive prints) published by A. Bloteling, with several of the lions missing cf. Wijngaert, op. cit., no. 19; an 11 profeta Daniele nel luogo dei Lioni. Locatelli d'Alvisopoli div. et inc. nel 1834; Daniel in the den of lions, drawn and engraved by Francis Lamb; and Danie in the Lions den, engraved by W. Ward (mezzotint) . William Hay ley, on his tour of Scotland in April 1767, called on the Glasgow printers, the Foulis', and purchased "a respectable print, very nicely impressed on satin" of the Daniel; see M. Bishop, Blake's Hayley, London, 1951, p. 39 (I am indebted to Miss P. Milne-Henderson for this reference to 18th-century taste) . The British Museum, Franks collection no. 88.11-10.30, is a blue and white panel of Delftware c. 1700 after the de Leeuw print. Such instances of the decorative use of the design can surely be multiplied. Rooses, vol. V, p. 148, records a drawing in red and black chalks, washed and lightened, said to be for an engraving of the Daniel which was in the Tersmitten sale, Amsterdam 1754 (444) and the Gérard Hoet sale, The Hague 1760 (457), bought Rottemont. 37 Six lions appear at the left of Theodor van Thulden's Presentation of the Stadhoudership of the Seven Provinces to Prince Frederick Henry, signed and dated 1651, the canvas painted to go over the doorway to the Oranjesaal of the Huis ten Bosch. Five of these lions appear also on a sheet of drawings published by Rooses, vol. V, p. 226, no. 1426, pl. 406, as Rubens' study c. 1618 for the Daniel: Albertina inv. no. 499, pen on white paper, 350 x 220 mm., inscribed lower right P. P. Rubbens fet. All ten lions on this Albertina sheet were copied from Rubens' painting by T. van Thulden. His own study of a seated greyhound, at the left, suggests the connection with the Huis ten Bosch decoration. A profile of a similar dog appears, in reverse, standing at the right. This confusion, made by Rooses in 1892, of a sheet of copies by a Rubens pupil with sketches by the master himself has remained uncorrected. 38 J. Byam Shaw, The Burlington Magazine, vol. CI, 1959, p. 392, figs. 33 and 34, illustrated and discussed drawings by Domenico Tiepolo for these frescoes without reference to prints after the Daniel. A lion corresponding in reverse to the one of which the National Gallery recently bought the drawing appears in the Witt Collection drawing, fig. 33 (see note 15 above) . 39 NGA 1413. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Samuel H. Kress Collection 1961. 40 T. Landseer, An Essay on Carnivorous Quadrupeds, London, 1823, p. 2, "It is possible that as a painter of allegory, Rubens might consider that strong infusion of human form, character and expression, by which his Lions, for example, are distinguished, as necessary, or conducive, to his allegorical purposes; or, it is possible that his knowledge of this animal may not have been thoroughly well-grounded, and that he may have laboured under early prejudice of mind, or of vision, in this part of his education as a Painter, and may not have seen Lions as they really are." Having made this observation about Rubens' position in the history of making and matching images, Landseer continues, p. 3, "In like manner the Lions of Rubens are humanised ... so much in apology for using the license of asserting that the heads of many of the Lions of Rubens rather resemble those of frowning old gentlemen decorated with Ramillies wigs; as if Nature's journeyman had made manes, and had not made them well". Whilst Landseer hammered at the anthropomorphic appearance of the lions in the Daniel, a German contemporary of his took a view more sympathetic to the baroque if less precisely observant. S. H. Spiker, Travels through England, Wales and Scotland 1816 (trans. London 1820) , vol. I, p. 246, wrote of the State room at Hamilton Palace, "Of the other paintings, Rubens's masterpiece of Daniel in the Lion's Den, is particularly distinguished. The figure of the Prophet, his eyes turned up towards heaven, in pious resignation, forms a noble contrast to the lions springing on him from every quarter, but restrained as it were by a higher power." [my italics]. Dr. Spiker visualized the painting as "about 18' broad, by 12' high"! 41 M. Jafïé, Van Dyck' s Antwerp Sketchbook, London, 1966, vol.

Only Waagen of modern authorities has queried the attribution to Rubens (accepted by M. Rooses, A. Rosenberg, R. Oldenbourg, G. Glück), stating "für Rubens etwas zu glatter Behandlung". The handling is however quite characteristic of Rubens c. 1614. The alternative identification recently suggested for the imperial couple represented, as Tiberius and his first wife Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa, is not to be preferred to the traditional one. I am grateful to Mr. Michael Mahoney for supplying me with an infrared photograph as a check on the compositional development of this panel. 45 cf. M. Jaťřé, The Burlington Magazine, vol.

On the strength of seeing a photograph only in London, Mr. Millar replied, "It is obviously very Van Dyckian, but does not seem convincing as Van Dyck himself". The original portion, showing just the head, neck, and the upper part of the body narrower than shoulderwidth, is visible to the naked eye : but appears most readily in the infrared photography kindly arranged for me by Mr. Perry B. Cott ( Fig. 21). Ultraviolet photography confirms that except for a vertical split through the inner corner of the left eye, due to the movement of the panel, the original portion is well preserved.
