ROBINSON, Editor Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore NECROLOGY Paul Alphand6ry, since 1914 director at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes and co-director since 1908 of the Revue de 1' Histoire des Religions, died in May, 1932. He took an active part in the organization of the international congress of the history of religions and was the founder of the Sociate Ernest Renan and of the Societe frangaise de folklore. He was a specialist in the history of the heresies of the Middle Ages and of the great religious and intellectual movements of which they were the expression. Baldwin Brown, professor of the history of art at the University of Edinburgh, died in July, 1932, at the age of 82. He was the author of works on Rembrandt, on Hogarth, and on pre- historic art. His most important book, in six volumes (1903-1930), is entitled The Arts in Early England. 1 The department of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books is conducted by Professor DAVID M.

For an explanation of the abbreviations see Vol. xxxiv, 1, p. 194 and Vol. xxix, 1, pp. 115-116. Paul Couissin, professor at the Faculte des lettres d'Aix-Marseille and keeper of the Chateau Borely, died in March, 1932. He was extremely versatile, showing ability as a musician, draughts- man, and poet. His numerous studies on ancient arms and armor made him an authority in that branch of archaeology. He collaborated in the preparation of the archaeological map of Roman Gaul. Fernand Courby, member of the Faculte des lettres at Lyons and a specialist on Greek architec- ture, died at Lyons in March, 1932. He was a member of the French School in Athens, and his publications especially on Delphi and Delos are of the greatest importance. Joseph Destr6e, the honorary keeper of the Musie du Cinquantenaire at Brussels, died in March, 1932. He published a valuable mono- graph on Hugo van der Goes, and was noted as a connaisseur of tapestries, Flemish miniatures, and sculpture of Brabant. Henri Gaidoz, distinguished in the field of Cel- tic studies and folklore, died in June, 1932, at the age of 90. He founded and for some time di- rected the Revue celtique and Melusine. He con- tributed to the Revue Archeologique and the Encyclopedie des sciences religieuses, and was for a long time director at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes where he taught Celtic language and literature. John Francis Greene, Associate Professor Emeritus of Roman Literature and History at Brown University, died on February 7, 1933, at the age of sixty-five. G. H. Hallam of Harrow died at Tivoli in July, 1932, at the age of 86. He was interested in Roman archaeology and is the author of articles in the Journal of Roman Studies on a tomb of a Vestal discovered at Tivoli and on the cult of Hercules Victor. Gustav Kossina, professor of prehistoric archaeology at the University of Berlin, died in 117</page><page sequence="2">118 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY December, 1931. He had been librarian at Halle, Bonn, and Berlin and editor of the Baede- ker guide-books for Germany. He published many works on pre-Roman antiquities, and founded and edited Mannus and the Mannus- Bibliothek. The Gesellschaft fiir deutsche Vor- geschichte and the Nachrichtenblatt (on the ex- cavations) both owe their existence to Kossina. Jules Martha, honorary professor at the Sor- bonne, died in April, 1932, at the age of 79. He was a member of the French School at Athens and later taught Latin literature at Montpellier, Dijon, Lyons, the Ecole normale and the Sorbonne. He published in 1880 a catalogue of the terra- cottas of the Archaeological Society of Athens. His doctoral dissertation on Les Sacerdoces athkniens appeared in 1882. He collaborated with Rayet on Monuments de l'art antique. In 1884 he published a compendium of Etruscan and Roman Archaeology, followed in 1889 by his important volume, L'Art trusque. Besides a study on the Etruscan language he edited texts and translations for the Hachette and Bude collections. Henry Oppenheimer died in March, 1932, at London. He had formed one of the finest private collections of drawings and objets d'art of the Renaissance. Edward Prior, Professor of the History of Art at the University of Cambridge and founder of a school for the study of architecture at that uni- versity, died in August, 1932. He was the author of a history of Gothic architecture in England (1900) and, in collaboration with Arthur Gardner, of a work on Mediaeval Sculpture in England (1912). Maurice Roy, the economist and referendary counsellor at the Cour des Comptes, died in June, 1930. He had acquired an honorable position among historians of art by his discoveries on French art of the sixteenth century. Archibald Henry Sayce, eminent Biblical scholar, distinguished Assyriologist and Egyptolo- gist, was born September 25, 1845, and died on February 4, 1933, at the age of eighty-seven. He was Deputy Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford from 1876 to 1890. He was Hibbert lecturer in 1887, Gifford lecturer in 1900-1902, and Rhind lecturer in 1906. He was Professor of Assyriology at Oxford from 1891 to 1919. Professor Sayce had many honorary degrees and was the author of many standard books on Oriental languages, religions, and his- tory. Many anecdotes are told of him, such as his escape after being ordered shot as a spy in the Franco-Prussian War, and his burning out from his ankle with a hot iron the poison caused by the bite of an asp. Some of his many archaeological publications were The Monuments of the Hittites, 1881; Fresh Light from the Monuments, 1883; The Ancient Empires of the East, 1884; The Races of the Old Testament, 1891; Patriarchal Palestine, 1895; The Egypt of the Hebrews and Herodotus, 1895; Babylonians and Assyrians, 1900; Egyptian and Babylonian Religion, 1903; Assuan Papyri, 1906; The Archaeology of Cuneiform Inscriptions, 1907; Reminiscences, 1923. PREHISTORIC Rock-Drawings and Paintings in the Fezzan Desert.-In the land of the ancient Garamantes the German African Expedition under Professor Leo Frobenius has discovered some 2500 paint- ings and engravings of great interest, dating, he believes, from the twelfth to the third millennium B.c. They are found on the steep rock-walls bounding ancient lakes. They vary in size, the larger being generally naive and realistic, the smaller superior in artistic value. The elephant, giraffe, zebra, lion, buffalo, rhinoceros, crocodile and other animals are represented, as well as human beings and animal-headed creatures with human bodies. Especially interesting is the representation of cattle with horns curving for- ward, a phenomenon attributed by Herodotus to the cattle of the Garamantes, which, he says, forced them to graze backwards. The subjects and styles are paralleled at other sites where primitive wall-decoration exists, such as Spain, France, and North Africa. (LEo FROBENIUS in the Illustrated London News, Nov. 19, 1932, pp. 798-801; ibid. Nov. 26, 1932, pp. 860--1.) EGYPT The Four Shrines of Tutankhamen.-These shrines which once, fitted one within another, enclosed the sarcophagus in which lay the mummy of Tutankhamen, have now been placed on dis- play side by side in the Cairo Museum. They are made of oak and cedar, perfectly preserved, covered with gesso and overlaid with sheet gold, beautifully decorated. The outermost shrine bore magic symbols in blue faience; it was fas- tened with ebony bolts. The second shrine was incised with designs from the book "Of that which is in the Underworld" and closed by a seal bearing</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1939 119 the name of Tutankhamen and a jackal recum- bent over the nine foes of Egypt. In front of this shrine hung a linen pall torn by the weight of the gilt bronze marguerites on it. The third and fourth shrines bore decorations like those of the second, and inside the fourth was a yellow quartzite sarcophagus containing the mummy of the king. (Illustrated London News, Jan. 7, 1933, pp. 3-5, 7.) Excavations at Meydfim.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXII, No. 1, March, 1931, pp. 9-84 (39 plates), ALAN ROWE presents a thorough report of the Eckley B. Coxe, Jr. Ex- pedition Excavations at Meydfm, 1929-1930. The excavations described in this paper are those of the Pyramid, the passages and chambers of which were thoroughly cleared out and the N. E. and W. sides partly cleared; of the Pyramid temple, silo, and causeway. The work on Masta- bah No. 17, which formed part of the season's dig, is to be reported in a later issue, after further research. A chronological list is given of the workers at Meydiim, from the Arab observer of the twelfth century to the aircraft survey made in 19928, which latter included a photograph taken from an altitude of 11,000 feet! Rowe suggests that Seneferu may have been buried originally at Meydfm (before the Dahshur pyramid was completed), and later moved to Dahshir; that the cult was kept up in both places, for the reason, possibly, that the royal Ka was imagined as returning occasionally to Meydim, its original resting place. After listing the officials in the several dynasties who worked on the pyramid, the author studies the gangs of craftsmen and the evidence from quarry-marks, etc. In the pyramid only the good limestone from the eastern hills is marked; the inferior local stones have at best a few mean- ingless lines upon them. A number of intrusive burials were found, dating after the XXth dy- nasty, in the debris against the pyramid's side. Before this period of complete neglect, the pyra- mid had long been used as a quarry; and this continued for centuries, for, even between the recorded Arab visit of 1117-19 and the visit of Captain Norden in 1737, the number of stages of the pyramid had been reduced from five to three. In modern times Maspero was the first to open the pyramid (1881-82), and it was subsequently examined by Petrie (1891). The pyramid temple had been used at some time, probably about the VIth dynasty as a habitation doubtless of shep- herds, but this was not later than the XVIIIth dynasty, since an intrusive grave of that period is found there. An interesting silo is still at- tached to the building, the work of these shep- herds. The temple itself, built up against but not bonded into the pyramid, is the oldest com- plete stone building of its kind in existence. It has a passage, central chambers, and an offering court. An excellent plan (in the plates) together with a detailed description gives an idea of the appearance of the Temple. There was originally a long causeway leading to the brick enclosure which, at a distance of 95 metres, surrounded the pyramid in the IVth dynasty; the causeway is more than 940 metres long from its beginning to the entrance of the temple at the pyramid's base. A brick furnace, for smelting metals, dat- ing later than the causeway, was found near its lower end. The plates which accompany the article-several of them large folding maps, plans, and elevations-are excellent, thorough, and valuable. A bibliography of 81 works completes the paper. THE ORIENT ASSYRIA AND BABYLONIA Excavations at Ur.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXII, Nos. 3-4 (Sept.-Dec. 1931), pp. 2,47-990, C. LEONARD WOOLEY gives in de- tail, with plates (XXVIII to XLI) consisting of plans, and photographs of sites and finds, a report of the Excavations at Ur, 1930-1931, mentioned earlier in this Journal. Excavations at Fara.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXII, Nos. 3-4, Sept.-Dec. 1931, pp. 192-945 (Map and XXVII page plates each with several photographic figures), DR. ERICH SCHMIDT gives a preliminary report of Excava- tions at Fara, 1931. The mound of Fara lies in Iraq about midway between Baghdad and Ur. Koldewey's Babylon expedition in 1902-1903 had turned over a good deal of the mound, but had not the means to re- move the dirt; thus the original contour of the mound has been changed. The apices of the tell had been disturbed thoroughly, and test sites had to be chosen at medium heights (3 to 8 m. above the plain). The region was divided, in survey, into plots: the site of the main Tell at Fara covers an area of about 10 by 10 metres; the total terri- tory spreads over about 14,000 of them. Seven</page><page sequence="4">120 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY test squares form the basis for the report, in only one of which, inside a circular brick shaft, was there time to penetrate to the mound base. In spite of the need for haste and in spite of the peculiarly trying desert weather, the most careful procedure was followed; a short account given by Dr. Schmidt is almost a classic account of proper archaeological procedure. Three principal strata were noted, of which II is the richest and has been most thoroughly studied. The finds were as follows: in Stratum I, painted jars; plain bowls, pitchers and cups in Stratum II; elaborations of these types in Stratum III. Of considerable interest also are scaraboid seals and archaic seal cylinders and cuneiform tablets of some historical importance. Stratum I so far has given no written records. When opened more thoroughly it may perhaps show relations between the earliest Sumerians and the Jemdet Nasr people (Elamites?), in some primi- tive pictograph. The evidence of the cuneiform material as to the ancient name of the Tell, is for Shuruppak (Sukkurru) mentioned in the my- thology as a "pre-diluvial city" of Mesopotamia and the home of Ut-Napishtim, the Sumerian Noah. Fara now joins Ur and Kish with evi- dence of a great inundation on top of human deposit. Perhaps the Noah story symbolizes the survival of the Sumerian and end of the Elamite Jemdet Nasr culture. There is a co- incidence, at least, in this at Fara. The under- standing of the text is much enhanced by the fine plates. Ancient Wheat and Barley from Kish, Mesopo- tomia.-In Am. Anth., Vol. 34, No. 2, April- June, 1932, pp. 303-309, HENRY FIELD tells about the expert analyses which were made by several specialists on specimens of grain from the excava- tions at Kish. Two varieties, namely wheat and barley, were definitely distinguished. The wheat appears to be of the "triticum turgidum" (Rivet or Cone) or "triticum compactum" (Club) types. The samples of barley were too charred and blackened to allow a positive identification. However, it was possible to recognize in them "some form or type of barley." In addition to these two, certain seeds were found, but these were impossible to identify, except that one group was "very similar to those of certain species of ' Panicum.'" The deposits with which all these specimens were associated are dated at the beginning of the fourth millennium B.c. ARABIA Sanctuary of Allt at Iram.-In R. Bibl. (Oct. 1932), pp. 581-597 (4 plates, 5 figures), LE R. P. SAVIGNAC gives a preliminary report of his ex- amination of the ruins in the region of 'Aqaba discovered by the directors of the Department of Antiquities of Transjordan. At Djebel er-Ram or Ramm or Iram, east of 'Aqaba, traces of a former settlement were found-remains of an irrigation system, two little structures which seem to have been temples, and beside the main spring of the mountain the remains of a sanctuary which, according to the Nabatean inscriptions and graffiti accompanying it, was dedicated to the goddess Alldt. One of the inscriptions bears the name of the Nabatean king, Rabel II (70-106 A.D.). A hill in front of the temples bore some Thamudic graffiti and one Minaean, incidentally the most northerly Minaean inscription yet dis- covered. At el-Ghazaleh, about 7 kilometres south of this spot, other ancient Arab inscriptions and graffiti were found. These will all be dealt with in a future number of the Revue. The peculiarities of a composite Nabatean graffito found nearby are described in detail. The ruins of qasrs at el-Kithara and 'Ain-el-Khaldi, north of 'Aqaba, are also described. These forts seem to have been built by the Nabateans to guard the road from 'Aqaba to Ma' an and were later oc- cupied by the Romans, as the pottery fragments testify. Inscriptions in Arabia.-In the Archiv fiir Orientforschung, viii. 3 (1932), pp. 105-113, H. GRIMME compares the Rees collection of 182 brief inscriptions from the Harrat er-Radjil (published by Rend Dussaud in Syria, X, 1929, pp. 144-163) with the Safaitic inscriptions in respect of script, personal, divine, and tribal names, and offers a number of suggestions as to their reading and interpretation. He disagrees with Dussaud's interpretation that they are merely memorial inscriptions, the work of mem- bers df the Safaite military posts which guarded a road from 'Amman to the Euphrates. The presence of the lam before each personal name at the beginning of each inscription leads him to see in them religious monuments of profound signifi- cance (cf. his treatment of the Safaitic inscriptions in his book Texte und Untersuchungen zur safa- tenish-arabischen Religion, 1999). The possession expressed by the lam signifies the participation in something which originally belonged to the god,</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 1Q1 i.e. the stone. By scratching his name, which was a part of his living self, on a stone, a man not only became part-owner of the stone but united himself thereby with the god inhabiting the stone and so assured his own immortality. Grimme believes that in the second century A.D. the Harrat er-Rddjil, the residence of the god Rudu, was a place of pilgrimage for northern Arabs and that the inscriptions collected by Rees represent their work. The little stone houses which occur in this locality are too small to have been used as dwellings; Grimme would connect them with the practice of incubation. (On the Safaitic inscrip- tions compare Torrey's remarks in The Excava- tions at Dura-Europos, ed. Baur and Rostovtzeff, 1931, pp. 172-177.) The Capitals of El Hasne in Petra.-As a contribution toward eventually determining the purpose and date of this building, for which there is no external evidence, K. RONCZEWSKI has published photographs or drawings of a large number of the capitals of columns and pilasters, together with a few comparable pieces in museums in other countries. Arch. Atnz. 1932, pt. 1/2, cols. 38-89; 39 figs. PERSIA The Age of Susa I and II.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 907-217, A. HERTZ on the basis of archaeological evidence would place the proto- Elamite Susa II period in the fourth millennium, and would date the earliest stratum of El Obeid in Mesopotamia about 5700 B.c. and Susa I about 6000 B.c. Excavations at Tepe Hissar.-The University Museum, Philadelphia, with the coiperation (luring the earlier months of the campaign of the Pennsylvania Museum of Art, and later of the American Institute for Persian Art and Archae- ology, has completed more than a year of practi- cally continuous work at Tepe Hissar, a site near Damghan. In the main mound with its extensive lower terrace, a stratum characterized by gray pottery was found superimposed on a deposit defined by painted pottery. A low mound with a few Islamic surface remains covered a remark- able Sassanian building constructed on prehis- toric deposits. Without attempting any definite dating at this time, the prehistoric strata at the site may be dated from roughly 3000 B.c. to roughly 1500 B.c.; the painted pottery culture (Hissar I) was followed by two phases of the gray pottery culture: Hissar I and II. Hissar I excavations have been only soundings, and hence did not uncover coherent building complexes. The walls found were constructed of straw-tempered mud layers, rather than indi- vidual bricks. No fired brick was found in any of the strata of prehistoric Tepe Hissar. The pottery of Hissar I was the product of an already advanced potter's art, with wheel technique and rather elaborate forms. On a ground of buff, brown, or red are dark gray or brown patterns of varied types--both geometric and conventional- ized naturalistic: especially the ibex, gazelles, and birds. Copper was the only metal found in Stratum I, notably copper pins (found in many cases in one of the vessels of a burial) and daggers with long, slender blades. Many of the numerous seals appeared to have been employed merely as ornaments. Surprising for northeastern Persia of the third millennium was the appearance of frit seals. The extraordinary frequency of animal figurines in all strata indicates their use as magic images. Sheep and rams were the most numerous, and an interesting corollary was the abundance of spindle whorls found in Stratum I. Stone implements were no more frequent here than in later strata, despite the greater proximity of Hissar I to the Stone Age. Bone objects were scarce. A great wealth of gypsum, frit, and other stone beads was found in the burials of Hissar I. The burials of this period showed no traces of grave enclosures, coffins, or the like. They occurred below every building investigated. Massed burials were found only in Stratum III. Hissar I burials had contracted legs, and the face, with but few exceptions, pointed towards the right side. Mortuary equipment consisted of painted bowls, jars, and cups; a copper pin; seals or seal-shaped ornaments; and beads. Appar- ently the people of Hissar I gave way to those of Hissar II who came as invaders, gradually im- planting their culture. However, no trace of any battle was found. The excavation of test squares, only, in Stratum II precluded the finding of complete building complexes. Gray bowls, jars, and goblets with stems and expanding bases were the typical pottery of Hissar II. Most of the pottery showed wheel marks. Mutual absorption of certain ceramic features took place in the transition from I to II; shapes of many of the bowls and jars of II are identical with those of the painted ware of I, but the exaggerated stems are char-</page><page sequence="6">122 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY acteristic of II and not of I. The copper objects of II were superior to those of I. Objects of silver and lead appear for the first time. All silver objects are ornaments. The first copper seals at Hissar appear in Stratum II, but there were no outstanding pottery sculptures or stone objects. There was, however, a wealth of ornaments of various kinds. Stratum II was primarily defined by the mortuary equipment of the early graves in the bottom remains of the gray pottery deposits. About thirty burials gave conclusive evidence as to the main distinctions between Strata II and III, and there was apparently no definite break between the two periods. Stratum III of Tepe Hissar was mainly investi- gated in a section on the main mound, but it extended over most of the site. Rooms were defined at a few spots only. One of the most typical pot forms of Hissar III is the bottle pitcher. Not a single bowl, cup, pitcher, or jar in any stratum was supplied with a handle which would accommodate fingers or the whole hand; holes for suspension, or grips of ladles, alone occur. Use of the potter's wheel seemed to be wholly absent during Hissar II, despite features otherwise far advanced over past culture periods. Hissar II workmanship in metal excelled that of Hissar I, and, in turn, the people of Hissar III far surpassed their predecessors as to metallurgic skill and variety of metal products. Extraordi- nary copper bidents, some of them intentionally "killed," and a large copper disk of unknown use, covered with coats of fibrous matter on either side and with concentric circles stippled in repousse' fashion, were among the more unusual copper objects of this period. Vessels of silver, lead, and copper occurred in Hissar III only in the graves of the wealthiest persons. An attractive, though odd-shaped silver pitcher with a globular body and a long bill spout is worthy of especial note. An interesting combined trident and ladle was probably used for culinary purposes. A valuable hoard of objects from the last phase of Hissar III was found in early refuse of Hissar II: five heads of mountain goats cut out of sheets of gold had gracefully carved horns measuring more than five inches in breadth. Little sculptures of copper and silver, alabaster, serpentine and clay, reflect the artistic sense and skill of the Hissar III people. Many other objects of gold, onyx, chalcedony, and alabaster are of great aesthetic value as well as of archaeological importance. Spontaneous western (i.e. Mesopotamian) in- fluence may be assumed from the fact that during the last prehistoric period at Tepe Hissar stone vessels of highly elaborated forms suddenly ap- pear, while in Mesopotamia stone vessels had been extensively employed for more than a millennium. Two seals also suggest, by their subject matter, that they were imported from Mesopotamia. Unique among the stone objects were two alabaster specimens of problematic use: one a smooth concave cylinder with a shallow diametrical groove across either base ending in rectangular depressions which are cut out of the margins; the other a smooth disk with a grip: standing vertically this "shield" fits into the grooves of the cylindrical object. The mortuary equipment of prominent Hissar III persons always included a curious device: a copper rod usually ending in a bulbous base. Of the 180 skeletons or skulls of the Hissar III period found in the main mound, four graves were of outstanding persons, and of these three are rather isolated, the fourth being partly en- closed by a crescent of crowded burials at a respectful distance, indicating a person of high rank whose survivors desired to bury their dead close to him. Communal pit burials were also found in this cemetery. In none of the pre- historic burial groups was there any rule con- cerning orientation of the bodies. Plain earth burials were the rule; mud cists seldom occur. Definitely Mongoloid features were noticed in several of the skulls, but the bulk of the Hissar III population apparently belonged to the Cau- casian race. The end of the period of greatest achievement coincides with the desertion of the site about three and a half millenniums ago. About two millenniums later the Sassanians built a palace on the peripheral remains of the ancient towns. No traces were found of war or conquest by for- eign people during the period of Hissar III, and it must be assumed provisionally that the com- munity was wiped out by an epidemic. The ground plan of the Sassanian palace was determined, and the wealth of architectural and decorative fragments permit of a fairly accurate conception of the original appearance of the building. It was impressively ornamented with white stucco plaques on which were reliefs of boars' heads, stags, ibexes, human busts, and other designs. Traces of polychrome paintings were found on wall fragments and elsewhere; one</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 19312 1F23 of these pictured a horse with harness decorated with rosettes and flowing ribbons. Arches and friezes were all elaborately decorated also, but most impressive was the colonnade, with its large mud-brick columns covered with a shell of decor- ated stucco; a number of these columns remained standing in fragmentary condition. Other more slender columns apparently formed a garden pavilion beyond the main structure. Finds of small objects around the palace were exceedingly rare; not a single intact pottery vessel was discovered, though a number of glass beads and fragments of iron and bronze were found. A few copper coins may, after treatment, become sufficiently legible to give the accurate (late of the building. A complete report on the Tepe Hissar excava- tions has not yet been published. Short ac- counts have appeared in the University Museum Bulletin, Vol. 3, Nos. 1, 3, 5, in the Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Vol. XXVII, No. 147, and in the Illustrated London News, Jan. 28, 1933, pp. 116-119. SYRIA AND PALESTINE Inscriptions in Syria.-A considerable number of Greek, Latin, and Nabatean inscriptions dis- covered by M. DUNAND in the course of journeys into the Djebel Druze and the Hauran between 1925-29 are being published in the R. Bibl (July, 1932, pp. 397-416; Oct., 1932, pp. 561-580). These will supplement the collections of W. H. Waddington (Inmc. de la Syrie) and of the Prince- ton Expedition (Publications of the Princeton University Archaeological Expeditions to Syria in 1904-5 and 1909, Division III). Texts already published elsewhere will be given only if Dunand's copies authorize new readings. Excavations.-The editors of the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine are meeting a long-felt want in supplying a concise up-to-date bibliography of all the excavations which have been conducted in Palestine. Vol. i, 1932, pp. 163-199, lists all the work which has been done in or near Jerusalem. A map of the city, showing the location of the sites excavated, accompanied by cross-references to the bibliog- raphy, is given; also addenda to the bibliographies of other sites, given in earlier portions of the Quarterly (pp. 86-94, 139-149). A map to ac- company the completed bibliography has been compiled by the Palestine Exploration Fund and is published in its Quarterly Statement, Oct. 193e. A brief survey of the work done in Palestine during the season of 1931 will be found in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities, Vol. i, 1932, pp. 157-162, that of the season of 1931-32 in Vol. ii, pp. 184-194. Phoenician Settlement at 'Atlit.-The Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities, Vol. ii, 1932, pp. 41-104 (24 plates, 94 figures), contains the full report by C. N. JOHNS of the excavations conducted by the Department on the site of 'Atlit during the season of 1930-31. The most surprising discovery was that there had been a Phoenician settlement here from about 900 B.C. down to Hellenistic times. The evidence was found in the burial-ground in the rocky ridge at the south-east corner of the town. Fourteen tombs have so far been cleared. In most the original arrangement has been confused by a succession of burials, first in the chambers and afterwards in the shaft. But a few intact burials could be dated by Phoenician coins and other means to the latter half of the Persian period, the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. The contents of the tombs reflect a mixed culture typically Phoenician. For example, on the scarabs Her- akles is depicted in Gilgamesh fashion as slaying a lion which he holds up by the hind leg. Other examples of this treatment of Herakles have been found at sites which were closely connected with Phoenicia. The majority of the objects dis- covered were women's ornaments, many of Egyptian origin or design. The ordinary decora- tion of a woman of this locality consisted of a heavy bronze anklet (always worn on the right ankle), a pair of silver earrings, an iron finger- ring, and a necklace of blue or green glass or frit beads, which usually included a sacred eye amulet. Many of the beads were of the "strati- fied eye" type common throughout the whole Mediterranean area during the Persian period. Some broken specimens of Greek painted pottery were found, the earliest being Attic black-figured lekythoi of the sixth century B.C. There were also a few samples of a ware which was neither as fine nor as bright a red as Cypriote geometric nor as hard as terra sigillata. JOHNS suggests that this ware may represent an extension of the Attic industry into Asia Minor, perhaps at Pergamum. The commonest type of pot found in the graves was a long jar or amphora pointed at the base and almost hole-mouthed, resembling forms from the Persian period found in the Egyptian Delta and elsewhere. About a third of</page><page sequence="8">124 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the burials contained very few objects of any kind. The absence of amulets and of Egyptian objects was particularly striking. JOHNS suggests that these were the graves of men; the occurrence of a few javelin- and arrow-heads of European types suggests further that they were Greek mercena- ries who had settled here on their discharge. And we know that in the period to which these tombs seem to belong (early fourth century B.c.) Greek mercenaries were being employed on a large scale by both Persians and Egyptians. Excavations at Tell-en-Nasbeh.-Tell-en- Nasbeh, the Biblical Mizpah, seven miles North of Jerusalem, was excavated under the direction of Professor Bade. The temple, which seems to have been dedicated to Astarte, is dated at 900- 700 B.c. Among the important finds is the agate seal of Jaazaniah, a contemporary of Gedaliah. Excavations in Samaria.-Owing probably to the absence of a water supply, Samaria did not become a great city at an early date, though traces of an early Bronze Age settlement have been found. About 880 the hill was bought by Omri, and under him and his son Ahab reservoirs and other buildings were erected. Under fine Hellen- istic walls have been found traces of Israelite walls dating from the time of Omri and his son. On the summit near the northern enclosure wall were discovered some fine ivory plaques of two types; the first are in low relief with gold leaf and enamel inlays, representing Egyptian subjects, Harpok- rates, Isis, Nephthys, Hah, and so on, while the second, often pierced, are of Syrian style and represent cherubim, sphinxes, lions, bulls, palms, and flowers. Probably these ivories decorated furniture, though it is possible that they were let into the walls, thus accounting for the name of Ahab's "House of ivory." Under the Roman Empire a great city arose on the site, but it was later known only to pilgrims to the so-called tomb of John the Baptist. Besides the well- known cathedral built by the Crusaders, a second church was found by the present excavators, com- pletely buried although the walls remain to a height of more than 12 feet. John Phocas of Crete who visited it in 1185 describes the tiny chapel above the pit into which the head of John had been thrown by Herodias, mother of Salome. Above this are to be seen remains of a wall-paint- ing showing the martyrdom of Saint John and the finding of his head. The legend is, however, late. J. W. CROWFOOT in the Illustrated London News, Jan. 21, 1933, pp. 84-85. Pre-Hellenistic Greek Pottery in Palestine.- The gradually increasing number of fragments of early Greek pottery found in Palestine is disprov- ing the old idea that Greek influence in Palestine began with Alexander. Rather, it would seem that his military conquest had been preceded by at least three centuries of "peaceful penetration" on the part of Greek merchants. In the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine, Vol. ii, 1932, pp. 15-26 (5 plates), PROF. J. H. ILIFFE lists and describes most of these early pottery fragments (4 pieces of the seventh century B.c. found at Askalon; 28 of the sixth and fifth cen- turies found mainly at Tell Jemmeh, about 8 miles south of Gaza; and 5 others). Five of the frag- ments belong to the Black-Figure ware, of which the best known class is the Boeotian Kabeiric. Few of this type have been found outside Greece and none so far south. Further finds of pre- Hellenistic pottery have recently been made at Beth-zur (cf. B.A.S.O.R., No. 43, Pre-Hellenistic Greek Pottery in Palestine, Oct. 1931, pp. 2-13), which proves that Greek influence was not con- fined to the coast but had penetrated some distance inland. Greek and Latin Inscriptions.-The Greek and Latin inscriptions in the Palestine Archaeological Museum are to receive fresh treatment wherever necessary in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities. The first instalment by J. H. ILIFFE appears in Vol. ii, 1932, pp. 120-126 (3 plates). Mosaics.-A catalogue of all the mosaic pave- ments found in Palestine has been compiled by M. AVI-YONAH and is being published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities. The first instalment appears in Vol. ii, 1932, pp. 136- 181 (with tables of patterns). Cult of the Dioscuri in Samaria.-On the basis of two haut-reliefs found in Samaria and regarded as older than the third century A.D., it has been conjectured that there was a cult of the Dioscuri in that city. Ancient Street Levels in Jerusalem.-The engineers engaged in the repair of a section of the sewer beneath the Tariq al-Wdd (the Tyropoeon Valley of Josephus) in 1931 discovered traces at more than one point of two ancient street levels. The first was 2.90 m. and more below the present surface, and consisted of large flag-stones of white limestone more than a metre square and about 30 cm. thick. It was apparently constructed at the same time as the sewer beneath it, with which</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1931 125 it is connected at intervals by manholes. R. W. Hamilton would assign it to the early Byzantine period ("not earlier than Constantine or Eudo- cia"). The second street was found 2.10 m. below this one, and is thought to belong to the Herodian period. At one point a wall 14 m. thick was encountered. It is believed to be a part of the foundation of the viaduct which carried the Byzantine street across the Tyropoeon Valley to the Temple area.

ASIA MINOR Early Bronze Age Discoveries in Cyprus.-On the interesting plastic representation of the ritual snake-dance found at Vounous over a year ago further light has been shed by this year's finds. From them it is evident that the snake and bull were associated, for in a tomb in which was the skeleton of a bull were discovered pottery models of bulls' horns, probably part of the ritual dress of the officiating priest, and a bowl with bulls' heads and pendant snakes modelled on the rim. The mother-goddess present in last year's find appears with a child on a curious vase with four cups at the base. A plastic representation of a ploughing scene in which women with babies look on while the oxen draw the ploughs which their husbands guide is one of the earliest known representations of a plough. Very interesting is the inscription incised in linear characters on the handle of a red-polished jug; it shows certain affinities with degenerate hieroglyphic script but contains sev- eral signs peculiar to Cyprus. (P. DIKAIOS in The Illustrated London News, Dec. 10, 1932, pp. 928-9.) Has Hiiyiik.-Excavations were made in the summer of 1931 by L. DELAPORT in the mound of Has HUiytik (S. E. of Boghaz Keui) for the pur- pose of establishing the comparative chronology of a representative Hittite settlement. A trench sunk to a depth of over 15 m. (about the height of the mound) went below any traces of human oc- cupation, and the strata passed through were such as occur elsewhere in western and central Asia Minor, from the earliest time to the end of the Bronze Age. The lowest inhabited level had well-baked, polished, black pottery, but no traces of mud or stone dwellings. In the next higher level was a coarse, heavy, dull-colored ware; still higher and continuing to the top was red ware of various shades, hand polished and latterly show- ing geometric painted ornament. On the sur- face was found pottery with naturalistic deco- ration together with iron objects. Other small finds were some votive horns, one such decorated with a highly stylized face, being found intact, and an inscribed Egyptian seal used as an amulet. The site was abandoned toward 1000 B.c. and remained so until late in the nineteenth century. Arch. Anz. 1932, pt. 1/2, cols. 230-233; 2 figs. Excavations at Alishar Huyuk.-The work carried on since 1926 )by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago on this site (near Yozgat, now Bozok, S.E. of Boghaz Keui) has revealed nine successive stages of its history, many of them having several subdivisions. In the neolithic period, when it was a low eminence surrounded by marsh or lake, it was perhaps used chiefly as a refuge. After an eneolithic stage of habitation, there was in the early Bronze Age a fortified citadel with surrounding villages. The fourth period, that of the Hittite Empire, had some commercial relations with Cappadocia. In the fifth, or late Hittite, the citadel was again strengthened, and in the succeeding Phrygian period, part of the lower town, on a wide terrace, was included in the fortifications. After several comparatively uneventful centuries during Per- sian, Cappadocian and perhaps Galatian domi- nance, there was again a strong development in Roman and Byzantine times and a late, unimpor- tant Turkish and Armenian occupation. This sequence is typical of many habitable positions in central Asia Minor. The various stages are represented here by remains of dwellings, burials, pottery, and implements of different kinds, sometimes by sculpture, inscriptions, or imported objects. H. H. v. d.

Roman Remains in Angora.-In 1931, members of the Constantinople branch of the German Archaeological Institute investigated a piece of Roman street and remains of buildings which were discovered in laying out a new road on the N.W. limits of the city of Angora. The ancient street, running toward the N.W., was bordered on the left by a stoa, of which the stylobate was found in situ and some Corinthian capitals, architrave blocks in one piece with the frieze, and column bases were scattered about. It is all in a blue- veined limestone, and the somewhat clumsy and lifeless work is like all the rest of the Roman architecture found in the city. An architrave</page><page sequence="10">126 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY block is inscribed , n-porbXe]r ]7 r FaXa[rias. The stoa is of the second century but not earlier than Hadrian, and the paving of the street, of the first century. On the same side of the street but at a slight angle with it is the corner of a large building of the third century, a square projec- tion of which encroaches on the area of the stoa and must have destroyed the rear wall. The walls of this building are of opus incertum, but in the projecting tower (if such it was) there is a horizontal stripe of brick work 26 cm. wide, with masonry of small stones above. Something like this exists in the Hippodrome at Constantinople and in the imperial baths at Trier. Inside and parallel to the N.E. and S.E. walls of the build- ing is a double wall forming, apparently, a water conduit in two levels, the lower channel with vaulted top serving not to contain water but to give elasticity to the true water channel above, for varying pressures. A similar arrangement is known at Pergamon. No two of the known Roman remains in Angora have the same orien- tation, and the street in this quarter gives two more. The irregularity may have been taken over from the Galatian city, which was originally a converging point for incoming roads.-In a Christian burying ground east of the railway station were found Greek epitaphs of "servants of God," Theodotos, Maria, Margareta, Kyriakos, not earlier than 400, and the vaulted crypt of a small funeral chapel with apse toward the west, apparently of the early fourth century.-On the northern outskirts of the city was found a frag- ment of a replica of the Sidamara sarcophagus in Constantinople.--A quantity of broken Roman pottery similar to that found in the Rhine coun- try and including sigillata ware and a piece of drain-tile, with some of local manufacture, were found in the city.-Other traces of ancient life are a Roman milestone of the year 213 A.D., a palaeo- lithic flint core, and two settlement mounds S.W. of Angora, both having a terrace for a lower town to the south of the higher portion or citadel.

GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Archaeological Discoveries in Greece and the Islands, 1931-1932.-In G. KARO's annual sur- vey of archaeological work in Greek lands and the Dodecanese for 1931 to 1932, a few of the points brought out are the following: In Eleusis, excava- tion down to native rock under the Telesterion shows that here was the centre of the early pre- historic settlement, with Minyan sherds and Mid- dle Helladic graves, and also of the Mycenean town, which contained a large megaron house of more than one period. In the Telesterion itself are further evidences of changes of plan, both in the time of Ictinus and later, while a trace of what may have been the 1va/KTopoV is seen on the west side of the area. On an old road lead- ing off the Sacred Way west of Daphni are re- mains of houses of an unidentified Attic deme.- In B(eotia, the sanctuaries of Demeter at Lilaia and I)rymaia seem to have contained no temple b)uilding.-The mass of votive offerings at Pera- chora continues to yield bronzes and ivory carv- ings and countless imported objects, among them an Egyptian bronze mirror with the figure of the goddess Mut and a hieroglyph inscription, of 700 B.c., and a carnelian scarab with Heracles the Archer, an Ionian work of the period 550-500 iB.c.-In the Peloponnese, the foundations and part of the sculptured elements of an early Chris- tian basilica near the coast north of Sicyon may mark the site of New Sicyon. In Nauplia, a fine Venetian well-house has been cleared of encum- brances,-one of the all-too-few baroque remains in Greece. Near Sparta, a tomb of the first or second century A.D. is found to contain frescoes in Pompeian style with single figures in panels, of Apollo and the Muses.-In Aetolia, in the pre- historic settlement at Thermon, the apsidal houses and oval temple are found to have had vaulted roofs. In the Greek agora were found blocks from two lofty triangular pedestals for statues, like those of the Messenian Nike at Delphi and Olympia.-In Thessaly, two sites explored near Pharsalus are that of Old Pharsalus, abandoned before 400 B.C., and probably that of Euhydrion. From the latter comes a bronze statuette 30 cm. high, of 600-550. On the hill of Goritza east of Volo are walls, probably of Orminion, with a curious tunnel under the fortifications and in the cemetery, tombs with architectural decoration on the inside and fine gold and silver objects. In the great church at Nea Anchialos (Thessalian Thebes), the religious centre of Christian Thessaly, founda- tion and sculptural remains indicate three periods: Roman of the third century, Justinian of about 500, and a final one of the seventh or eighth cen- tury, with singular flat decoration.-In Mace- donia, the battle field of Pydna (168 B.c.) and the</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 193`2 1"27 neighboring country have been explored, with a number of Hellenistic and earlier sites. At Philippi, the Roman forum and adjoining public buildings, especially a Corinthian temple of about 200 A.D., have yielded mosaics, statues and inscriptions.-In Aegina, on the west slope of the temple hill, were found pits filled with miniature vases of about 550-5500, covered by omphalos- shaped stones with an inscription 4 PA[TPIA*], indicating a hero-cult. The omphalos seems to have similar associations in Hellenistic remains at Mitylene and on Roman gentile coins and wall paintings.-At Thasos, a huge pithos of red clay with flat, incised reliefs resembles the large Melian amphoras. At a site not far from the temenos of Poseidon are remains of prehistoric and polygonal masonry and Roman buildings destroyed in By- zantine times, probably belonging to a religious area.-At Polyochni on the east coast of Lemnos, a neolithic settlement of three periods, the last one merging into the Bronze Age and all probably destroyed by earthquakes, is the best built and best planned town yet found of so early a period. A broad, well-paved main street has a small plaza and a well in the middle, straight side streets, and comparatively large and well-built houses, with their ovens, storage jars, tools, and agricultural implements intact and remains of domestic ani- mals. Nothing Mycenaean.-The prehistoric town at Thermi in Lesbos has five strata, and in the uppermost one, a megaron house of a type developed from the long rectangular houses which occur in all the lower layers. The pottery cor- responds with the various forms from Troy I to VII, and includes a little Mycenaean. In the successive strata at Antissa were found gray Min- yan ware, red ware, Mycenaean, and Lesbian bucchero, the last possibly derived from the Min- yan.-In Ithaca, Homeric investigations continue at various points.-In Crete, in the royal tombs near Knossos, the skull of one of the latest burials, about 1400 B.c., is pronounced a cross between the native Mediterranean race and the Armenoid invaders. A finely cut and lifelike portrait head on a steatite seal represents a foreigner. On the shore north of the grotto of Eilithyia was found the harbor town of Amnisos, with remains from the Minoan periods and especially some fragments of frescoes in a peculiar technique, the floral design being inlaid, like the patterns on Myce- naean daggers. The little known ruins of Lasaia (Acts 27, 8), on the south coast, have been again studied. At Mallia, the palace of about 2000 B.c., with well-preserved stucco floors, is found to have the same general plan as the later palace, but extending farther to the south. A burial ground of MM I period and parts of the town, with large and elegant houses, have been uncov- ered.-In Rhodes, in the sanctuary of Apollo Erethimios, a Doric temple in antis of poros and marble, of about 400 B.c., is of interest because so little is known of East Greek work of that period. Inscriptions give details of the cult. In the neighboring theatre, of like date, plays were given in honor of the god. A great cistern which once supplied water for the hill of Camirus is older than most such works in mainland Greece. On the island of Nisyros, Rhodian ware and local imitations occur in a seventh-sixth century cre- mation cemetery, with some Attic vases which place the Rhodian vases some decades later than they have been dated. New Discoveries in Ithaca.-The third season in Ithaca of the British Expedition promoted by Sir Rennell Rodd has further established the probability that the island is indeed the Homeric Ithaca. At Aetos, in the southern part of the island, cairns were found heaped over ashes on a floor of potsherds, dated in the proto-Geometric and proto-Corinthian periods. Vases in great abundance were found illustrating all phases of development and showing also local forms of shape and decoration. Among these the most interesting are a proto-Corinthian jug bearing the inscription Kalilcleas (e) poiase, an oenochoe with a fish painted on the bottom, and a bird-shaped vase which was filled above the tail and emptied at the beak. The votive offerings comprise bronze, amber and ivory ornaments carved to represent animal and human figures. A wall running at right angles to the shore at the harbor is dated by the pottery in the fourth or third cen- tury B.c. A small cave at the west end could not be explored because the floor lies a metre and a half below the level of the sea, but fifteen late Mycenaean sherds of good style were removed. The similar cave at Polis when pumped dry proved to contain sub-Mycenaean cups, Mycenaean and pre-Mycenaean sherds, and a beautiful bronze tripod over a metre high, with two vertically set engraved handles surmounted by an animal. Parts of six others were also found, all dating in the eighth century. A bronze statuette of a bearded man from the Geometric period and the upper part of a large female figure of the sixth century were also found. (W. A. HEURTLEY in</page><page sequence="12">128 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY the Illustrated London News, Jan. 14, 1933, pp. 45-7.) Excavations at Dodona.-In Praktika, 1930, pp. 52-68, Professor D. EVANGELIDES summarizes the results of his excavations at Dodona. He has completely cleared the early Christian basilica, noteworthy for its three apses, and has uncovered the foundations of several buildings adjacent to this basilica. One of these was a small temple of the fourth century B.c. In the vicinity of this temple was found an archaic bronze statuette of a hoplite, complete except for the crest of the hel- met, and the shield. It measures 13 ~ centi- meters in height and is an admirable work of the early Peloponnesian school. Among the other objects found are lead plates on some of which are inscribed questions addressed to the oracle and the answers thereto, while others are decorated with reliefs. Western Europe and Greece.-In Zeit. fiir Ethnol., 1932, No. 1/3, pp. 127-130, SCHUCH- HARDT presents a paper motivated by his visit to Ireland to "elucidate the Ancient Greece." "What have these two countries, the most north- westward one and the most southeastward one in Europe to do with one another?" The answer to this highly presumptuous question would hardly exceed one word with those who really know something about the archaeology of either of these two countries. However, the enticing title and the learned author do solicit attention, the merit of the presentation notwithstanding. Schuchhardt starts with the following premise: Greek folk and culture developed out of three strata: (1) the Pelasgic-Karyan, (2) the Myce- naean, (3) the Dorian. Upon the Pelasgian- Karyan foundation, characterized by round huts, there superimposed itself around 2000 to 1800 B.C., a Nordic (sic) migration which brought in the megaron (sic) and which blended with the underlying stratum to produce the Mycenaean culture. Around 1200 B.C., there followed a second Nordic (sic) wave, the Dorian migration, with pile structures and the Dipylon culture. While the two infusions are more or less clear, the "Urschicht" presents serious difficulties because it is so completely overlain by precious (irremov- able?) monuments. However, certain soundings (Tiryns, Orchomenos, Olympia) show that it was quite similar to the Neolithic and Early Metal cultures which "lie before our eyes" in the West- ern Mediterranean, Spain, France, Southern England, and Ireland. "... so we can go there for advice on what in Greece remains still undis- closed." The author upholds Hubert Schmidt's aged con- tention that the Iberian peninsula was the centre of origin of the domed structures (megaliths) and all their associated culture traits. From there, tomb building, bell beakers, earliest metal work (sic), radiated in all directions. "A Spanish tholos grave such as the one at Romeral is fully as beau- tiful as the Atreus tomb of Mycenae and yet, some centuries older." The Mycenaeans had often adopted western Mediterranean customs and con- cepts. Witness the find of the Swedish Expedi- tion in 1928 of two rock-cut tombs with two men- hirs, a battle table and an altar nearby. "The road to Greece is marked by stone monuments in the Balearic Islands and in Malta." The Dorian immigration caused a break in western traditions and brought about the sullen underworld picture as portrayed by Homer. However, at the height of Greek philosophy, especially at the time of Pythagoras, old beliefs were revived, only to be discarded soon again. Whether Schuchhardt's visit to Ireland really helped him to "elucidate the Ancient Greece" as the heraldic first sentence would lead one to ex- pect, is left for the reader to guess. The impres- sion one gathers is that the author should have gone to Spain, to get some ideas for Ireland. But it seems that a trip to Greece would have really been more to the point, and that it might have given the author some idea of the difficulties involved in an attempt to "elucidate the Ancient Greece" on the basis of a merely informative excursion. Cremation in Minoan Times.-In 1929 at Tylissos in Crete was found a lebes containing human bones which had unmistakably been ex- posed to a hot fire. The lebes was certainly made for cinerary purposes, since it had no handles, and its sides were too thin for use over a fire. With the bones were fragments of a bronze spear and dagger, two pieces of iron apparently belong- ing to a knife, and fragments of two bronze fibulae. Beside the lebes was found a false-necked am- phora. The fibulae and the iron indicate the end of the Minoan Age, the Sub-Minoan period, but the decoration of the amphora, a scale pattern in an oval field, shows that the burial lies within the limits of Minoan culture. Evidence of crema- tion in Crete during the geometric or protogeo- metric period has been found at Vrokastro and Mouliana, but the lebes from Tylissos gives the first known instance of the practice of cremation</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 129 in Minoan times. (E. MARINATOS, Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 112-118, 4 figs.) Double Protomes and Twin Heads of Animals. -In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 197-906 (13 figs.), A. ROEs deals with the votive double protomes and twin heads of animals in European art. For both an oriental origin seems probable. The double protomes of birds which are characteristic for the Villanovan and Hallstatt civilizations do not seem to be of European origin, for the cult of the solar bird is of oriental origin, and, though common in geometric and Villanovan art, is not found in the following period. The Peleiades.-In R. Arch. xxxvi (1932), pp. 77-93, ALEXANDER KRAPPE discusses the doves of Dodona, which are birds of the thunder and belong to the cult of Zeus or of his predecessor. They are the Fpa-at, ordinarily two in number and believed to be the twin daughters of Porkos. Porkos is an ancient god of the oak tree and of the thunder; his name is the equivalent of the Latin quercus corresponding to the Vedic Par- janya, the Baltic Perkuns, the Slavic Perun, and the Scandinavian Fjorgyn. The priestesses were originally considered his daughters and designated by the names of HEXELle and of FpacaL, as the twin daughters of the god; thus in Syria the priests of the god of the thunder bore the name of the celestial twins who were his sons. The Fundamental Numerical Data of Ancient Geography.-In R. Arch. xxxvi (1932), pp. 1-34, ANDRE BERTHOLET discusses the work of ancient geographers, especially Eratosthenes, Dikae- archos, Hipparchos, Poseidonios, Agrippa, Mari- nos of Tyre, and Ptolemy. The astronomical observations left little to be desired and the esti- mates of distances of routes were exact, but the underestimation of the value of the degree pre- sented an obstacle to the co6rdination of the two sources of calculation of the geographical plan. The inaptitude of the ancients in measuring di- rectly the angles falsified the direction of land and sea routes, so that, in order to make the astronomi- cal and terrestrial measures agree, the countries were deformed on the maps. Ptolemy only par- tially corrected the errors of his predecessors, be- cause he was hampered by the initial mistake on the dimensions of the terrestrial sphere. As a unit of measure he employed the Egyptian stade adopted by Eratosthenes, but unfortunately he chose the unitary value of the degree calculated by Posidonius rather than the almost exact value determined by Eratosthenes. Aristotle's Constitution of Athens.-In the Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 54-64, ST. BEZDECHI considers Aristotle's Constitution of Athens. He treats with sympathy the system of Peisistratos and opposes demagogues like Pericles, although in the Politieia he is much more sympathetic to the democratic leaders. He apparently had a great admiration for Thera- menes with whose theories he here sympathized. Terra Sigillata Plates.-In Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 75-86 (10 pls.; 4 figs.), K. KiTBLER describes a group of terra sigillata plates, represented by many fragments which were found by the Ger- man excavators near the Dipylon. They belong chiefly to the fourth century A.D., but some of the finer specimens, which show Egyptian influence, were made in the latter part of the third century A.D. Christian emblems, except the fish, are ab- sent. The shapes are Egyptian, and the orna- mental patterns indicate Pannonian influence. Genuine and Forged Antique Bronzes.-A bronze "Apollo" statuette in Copenhagen, which was first published by F. POULSEN in 1920, has been considered by some scholars a modern forg- ery, but it has been proved to be genuine by chemi- cal and X-ray tests in comparison with an Etrus- can bronze and a modern bronze head. The alloy of the two ancient pieces contains a larger proportion of copper than the modern one, and this causes them to be more easily penetrated by the X-ray. Both of them contain the core of the casting, while the modern piece is hollow. (F. POULSEN, Arch. Anz. 1932, pt. 1/2, cols. 100-103; 2 figs.) SCULPTURE Athena Promachos.-On lamps of the second century A.D., found near the Dipylon, is repre- sented a bust of Athena with a high-crested Corinthian helmet. This is one of the two lead- ing types of the Athena bust found on Attic coins of the imperial period, on Cyzicene staters of the fifth century B.c., on fourth century silver coins of Velia, and on Alexandrian coins of the third century A.D. The second type, in which Athena wears the Attic helmet, was evidently inspired by the Athena Parthenos. It is, therefore, prob- able that the type with the Corinthian helmet was taken from the other colossal Athena of Pheidias, the Promachos. The series of coins with a representation of the Acropolis seen from the west confirms this view, and adds to our</page><page sequence="14">130 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY knowledge of the pose and attributes of the Promachos. The goddess stood resting her weight on the right leg, with a Nike in her right hand, the shield on her left arm, and the spear on her left shoulder. (B. PICK, Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 59-74, 3 pls., 2 figs.) Satyr with the Foot-clapper.-A fragmentary Roman sculpture reproducing the motif of the "Satyr with the Foot-clapper," found by the Ger- man excavators near the Dipylon, is published by F. MUTHMANN, Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 87-89 (2 pls.; 1 fig.). It was used as the decoration of a fountain. The tree trunk at the side of the Satyr belongs in style to a group of similar sup- ports of statues produced about the middle of the second century A.D. A New Statue of Tyche.-A statue of Tyche, of fine-grained white marble, recently found on the site of ancient Prusias ad Hypium, in eastern Bithynia, has been placed in the Museum of An- tiquities at Istanbul. The goddess wears san- dals, a long chiton with half-long sleeves, an hima- tion draped about the lower part of the figure, and a high diadem and mural crown decorated with acanthus leaves. The left hand and arm support a cornucopia full of fruits and grains, on the lower end of which sits a small child holding other fruits. The extended right forearm and hand which once held a steering-oar, are the only parts missing. This is the work of an artist of the Roman imperial epoch, influenced by fourth- century models. (A.

PEEK publishes a score of Greek epitaphs from the museums of Athens, Mykonos, Smyrna, Thebes, Chaeronea, Constantinople and Angora, and improvements in readings or inter- pretations of half a dozen epitaphs, already pub- lished, in the museums at Smyrna and Constan- tinople. Incidentally, in the epitaph from Eutresis (A.J.A. 1928, p. 179 f.) he regards the reading [Ka]Tad3s, rather than [Kalrdpas, as cer- tain, and differs from Miss Goldman in the inter- pretation of T7&amp; y Xota aLwwcr": this phrase means, he thinks, not that Rhodios will jest no more, but that he now sees the ridiculousness of human life. TOPOGRAPHY The Pompeion.-In Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 1-3t (10 pls.; 13 figs.), A. BRUECKNER gives a preliminary report of the German excavations of 1999 on the site of the Pompeion in the Cerami- cus at Athens. The Greek Pompeion, built in the first half of the fourth century B.c., was in the form of a gymnasium with an interior colonnade of 6 x 13 columns, a few small storage chambers at the rear and a marble propylon in front. Numerous graffiti and evidence of repairs to the stuccoed walls indicate a continuous and inten- sive use of the building until its destruction during the siege of Sulla, 86 B.c. For the next two centuries the site of the Pompeion was occu- pied by artisans, first a maker of purple dyes, then a blacksmith and a potter. The propylon, now roofless, was used for entrance to the shops (the remains of this period are described by W. ZSCHIETZSCHMANN, pp. 90-97, 3 pls., 2 figs.). Under Hadrian a new and slightly smaller Pom- peion was built at a level 1.50 m. higher than the former building, with an open area to the south, over the site of the Greek propylon. The Roman Pompeion was destroyed by the Goths in p67 A.D. About the middle of the following century, long before the building of the Justinian walls, a new city wall was erected south of where the Greek propylon had stood. The procession men- tioned by Himerius must have started inside this wall, since the site of the Pompeion was now occu- pied by two potter's kilns. Epigraphical evidence, hitherto lacking, that the identification of the Pompeion is correct is furnished by the name of the poet Menander, inscribed on a plinth of the outer wall of the Greek Pompeion, near a side entrance, for Pliny says that in the Pompeion were portraits of the comic poets. Other inscriptions mention the cults of Iacchos, Athena, Artemis, and Asklepios and Hygieia. The dedicatory inscription to Nemesis, found by the Greek excavators sixty years ago, has not been rediscovered. The grave inscrip- tions include (1) a pre-Themistoclean iambic dedication by [T]erpo to the memory of Melissa, (F) a retrograde inscription of imperial times be- longing to a tomb in which man and wife were buried together, and (3) inscribed epistyle blocks of the magnificent monument to Aurelius Rufus, the sophist, erected by his mother. A fragment of an adjustable calendar, with holes for the in- sertion of the divisions of the month, dates from the early Hellenistic period. On the base of a herm is an ephebic inscription of 95/94 B.c. The name of the 1raLcLLorpqip, Staseas, occurs on Delian inscriptions. The Parian marble head of</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 193W 131 Hermes shows the archaic treatment of the hair. The beard is less angular than that of the Per- gamene herm of Alkamenes, but seems to go back to an original of about the same date. VASES Lekythos by Amasis.-An early Attic lekythos, certainly the work of Amasis, which has long been unnoticed in the National Museum at Athens, is published by E. KAPOYZOY, Ath. Mitt. 56, 1931, pp. 98-111 (13 pls.). In shape the vase shows the first step in the evolution of the lekythos from the alabastron by the addition of a base and a more independent treatment of mouth and neck. The painted decoration represents a draped fe- male figure standing between two men, of whom the one on the right is naked and carries a spear-- perhaps Helen and the Dioskouroi, as on the Chest of Kypselos (Paus. V, 19, 3). The figures and the composition, the drapery, the beards of the men and anatomical details, leave no doubt that the vase belongs to the later period of Amasis. The author arranges in chronological groups 927 vases that have been recognized as the work of this potter. ITALY Excavations at Bologna.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 4t-50, E. ANDREOLI reports discoveries in the casa Benelli, at the corner of the via Parigi and the via Porta di Castello, where in 1929 Roman remains were found and a stretch of the northern wall of the medieval "cerchia delle quattro Croci." A lead pipe was found bearing the in- scription of two vilici, in charge of the distribu- tion of water, the first example at Bologna of more than one such official; it seems to belong to the end of the first century A.D. Also a com- plex of Roman constructions of importance for the topography of Bologna, since they confirm the existence of a compitum formed by the via Galliera and a decumanus minor, of which traces have been found. In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 51-88, A. Negrioli reports the discovery in the suburb of Bologna called Beverara, outside the porta Lame, of extensive remains of a large Roman villa, with several mosaic pavements, one of which has a polychrome "emblema." Parts of the building date from the last days of the Republic or the early Empire, and the mosaics are assigned to a period from the middle of the first to the middle of the second century of the Empire. The presence of three rooms with hypocausts and two large halls with mosaic pavements suggests that the building may have been a bath, but Negrioli is inclined to con- sider it a sumptuous villa with extensive bathing facilities. Sculptures from Hadrian's Villa.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 120-125, R. PARIBENI gives an ac- count of the discovery of sculptures at Hadrian's Villa in 1928, the publication of which was de- layed in the hope of finding missing parts, a hope which, however, was not realized. About 60 m. of the cryptoporticus between the theatre and the so-called Poikile were cleared; the passageway seemed from its construction to be designed for the use of the slaves. The finds were: two pieces of a statue of more than life-size, one a vigorous male torso, truncated at the thighs and lacking the arms; the other the right leg and a tree-trunk. The two parts fitted perfectly. It was evident that the right arm must have been raised, and the left somewhat separated from the body. From a knot on the tree-trunk hang two halteres, showing that the statue represented an athlete. Paribeni thinks that the athlete was crowning himself, after the manner of the Polycleitan Kyniskos at Olympia (Paus. vi, 4, 12), but that the style suggests an original of an earlier date. Also, a marble head of a young woman, larger than life, lacking nearly all the neck and chin and a good part of the nose. It is clearly a head of an Amazon from a bronze original, and the finder thinks it a replica of one of the famous group in the Artemisium at Ephesus (Pliny, N.H. xxxiv, 53). It most closely resembles the head of the so-called Amazon of the Villa Mattei, now in the Vatican, or the head of the Amazon in the Pal- azzo dei Conservatori. Another head, not quite life-size, of Greek marble, resembles the statue of Hypnos in the Museo del Prado. A fragment of a marble relief shows the left hand and caduceus of Mercury and the upper part of a youthful god- dess with a crown on her head and a mirror in her raised left hand; between them stands the knotted and leafless trunk of a tree. The relief suggests the three goddesses, accompanied by Mercury, presenting themselves to the judgment of Paris, a favorite subject in neo-Attic art. Discoveries near Este.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 99-42, A. CALLEGARI reports various discoveries in this town and its neighborhood: in the district called Albrizzi remains of Roman buildings, with a few coins and brick-stamps; at Podere Schivo va- rious small objects, including a curious terracotta</page><page sequence="16">13"2 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY figurine, 110 mm. high, representing a mourning woman, perhaps a praefica; in the via Pozzeto, 1.30 m. below the present level, a Roman road, running northwest and southeast; in the Scolo di Lozzo portions of an aqueduct, and two paterae with the handle of a third. The paterae are of Etruscan workmanship and evidently were in- tended for sacrificial uses, although there are no remains of buildings in the neighborhood; in the former park of Pellesina remains of a Roman bridge and a mosaic pavement; at Meggiaro vari- ous small objects. At Schiavonia (Monselice) there was acquired from a dealer in antiquities a stele ornamented with what appears to be a mili- tary genius, or perhaps an Attis; also a small bronze statuette of Zeus. At Morlungo sundry small objects were found, including a knife with blade and sheath of iron and a handle of bronze; at Monselice a stone ash-urn of cylindrical form, with a niche containing a rude figure of a seated man in a paludamentum. A fragmentary inscrip- tion on the urn is dated by Callegari in the first century A.D., but the urn was used much later for the ashes of a second person, represented by the seated figure. A Chamber-Tomb at Porano.-In this place, near Orvieto, A. MINTo reports the discovery, in the district called Settecamini of a chamber-tomb. It had been damaged in ancient times, but it was possible to recover, and to some extent restore, the form of the dromos and the sepulchral cham- ber. Among the finds were a bronze mirror, 0.18 m. in diameter, with a tang for attaching the handle. It has no border, but before a temple- front four figures appear, perhaps Helen and Paris between the two Dioscuri. Other finds in bronze were a large patera and a number of oinochoai of various sizes. One of the latter, 0.23 m. in height, has a handle of unusual design, with a mask of Silenus at the upper end, and at the lower end a badly corroded mask which may be Silenus, or perhaps Achelotis. A good many vases in bucchero ware and in light yellow terra- cotta were found; also some painted Etruscan vases, including a large krater and two stamnoi. (Not. Scav. viii, pp. 88-99.)': A Coin Hoard at Caligari.-In the commune of Riola at Is Benas ("The Springs") a hoard of large imperial bronze coins was found by two peasants. The money was scattered about the ground and there was no sign of a container or of ancient walls. The authorities recovered 149 pieces, many of which are in bad condition, with representations of emperors from Trajan to Gal- lienus. The greater number are coins of Alexan- der Severus (17) and his successors. There are no very rare specimens, but several present in- teresting features. (A. TARAMELLI, Not. Scav. viii, pp. 150-155.) A Necropolis at Gela.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 137-149, P. ORSI gives an account of a short cam- paign spent in the exploration of a necropolis in the district called Spinasanta, on a hill six miles from Gela. Some tombs had escaped violators and yielded interesting vases: a large amphora, 0.40 m. high, with a rope-form handle of an unusual kind; a large lekythos, 0.31 m. high, showing a female winged figure in a black chiton reaching to the feet (a funerary Genius), advancing with open arms towards a black hydria, to complete a sacrifice. It is an Attic work of the fifth century B.C. and has the last five letters of a name, prob- ably a 'Lieblingsname'; a large bronze hydria, 0.42 m. high, the vertical handle of which is at- tached by an appliqu6 in the form of a female mask of oriental appearance characteristic of the so-called ars Daedalica. A fine bronze strigil was transfixed by an iron nail, to make it useless, a frequent practice in funerary offerings. The writer also calls attention to a cup of Nearchos from Gela, presented to the Museum at Syracuse in December, 1924. Inscriptions from Castel di Sangro (Aufidena). -In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 198-129, V. BALZANO publishes two inscriptions discovered in 1931. One of these, found near the Ponte delle Grazie in the district Orti del Principe, is Oscan, and is given by Balzano in the following form: Pettiud E. M(eddix) T(uticus) -=omnino approbavit= Numnius (or Nummius) aedificavit. The other inscription, from the district Piano della Zittola, is in Latin and reads: C. Acellius Clemens por- tic(um) et saepta pro ludis Augustalib(us) faciend(um) curavit. These games were cele- brated in commemoration of the return of Au- gustus to Rome in 15 B.C., and of his birthday. Reggio.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 130-136, E. GALLI reports the discovery of an archaic head from Sybaris and a terracotta figurine from Thurii. The former, about 0.16 m. in height, is very badly damaged and shows traces of fire; it is in provincial Greek style and is perhaps to be assigned to the second half of the sixth century B.C. It is of mediocre workmanship, but inter- esting because of its provenance. The figurine, 0.10 m. high, is well preserved and is assigned to</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 133 the fourth century B.C. It is a caricature of a meretrix Sybaritana in the form of an old woman with the face of a comic mask. It was found at La Forgia on the right of the river Cratus, not far from its mouth. Excavations at Susa (Segusio).-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 3-13, P. BAROCELLI reports the results of excavations in an area southwest of the city, near the convent of San Francisco. Here a corridor and a chamber had been discovered in previous explorations. It was found that they formed part of a Roman amphitheatre, with two mae- niana, one of which was supported by the cor- ridor, while the other seems to have been of wood. In the corridor were several large rooms. The age of the building is difficult to determine, but the masonry suggests the end of the second cen- tury of the Empire, or the beginning of the third. On the Collina del Castello, regarded as the site of the pre-Roman town, remains of Roman build- ings came to light, apparently private houses, of an elegance of decoration hardly to be expected in that locality. In the neighborhood of the hill some Roman tombs of the early Empire and a fragmentary inscription were found. Excavations in Liguria.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 14-28, P. BAROCELLI reports various dis- coveries along the via Julia Augusta in Liguria: at Ventimiglia, the site of Roman Albintimilium, another stretch of the Roman road found in 1916, and fragmentary inscriptions, including a brick- stamp of the gens Lucheia, perhaps the same as the Lucceia mentioned in various Cisalpine inscrip- tions; at San Remo, on the western side of the city, remains of a piscina and other Roman constructions; at Bussana the remains of a Roman villa, probably a villa rustica; at Santo Stefano Riva the remains of a Roman bridge over the Rio della Torre. A Table-Support from Ciciliano.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 126-128, R. PARIBENI publishes a table- support found in the district of S. Giovanni in the course of agricultural work. On the sides are two winged female figures, on one face a broad palmette of elegant design, but of rather inferior workmanship, on the other the inscription: P. Plautio M. F. Ani(ensi) Pulchro, patrono benemerenti, Idmo l(ibertus). Plautius was a member of the family to which the well-known tomb near Tivoli belonged, a consul and triumph- ator, quaestor of Tiberius in 31 A.D. Idmo is new as the name of an actual person; it is found in poetry as the name of one of the Argonauts and elsewhere. Since the name implies skill, Paribeni conjectures that the table and the support were the work, as well as the gift, of Idmo. An Inscription from Grottaferrata.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp 117-119, R. PARIBENI publishes an inscription from the right side of the church of Badia di Grottaferrata. The inscription is cut on what was once a slab of marble 0.72 by 0.34 m. In it eight large circular holes were cut and it was used as a window of the church; in one of the holes was a thick disc of greenish glass. The inscription, which of course is in great part destroyed, consisted of a series of moral sententiae, of which a specimen is: Fortunatus modestus, infortunatus fortis esto. A Chamber-Tomb at Tarquinia.-In Not. Scav. viii, pp. 100-116, G. CULTRERA gives an account of the investigation of one of the great mounds of the "Doganaccia" in the extensive necropolis on the right of the road leading to Viterbo. Within it was found a chamber-tomb with a dromos drained by a canal of unusual form. The tomb had been pillaged and little remains of what must have been rich funerary offerings. Very few bronze articles were found, but numerous fragments of pottery. The foot of an oinochoe bore the painted inscription: Rutile Hipucrates. A Copy of a City Gate in Capua.-A diminutive relief of a double arched and two storied city gate, on a single stone built into the wall of a palace in Capua, is published, apparently for the first time, by E. JASTROW in Arch. Anz. 1932, pt. 1/2, (cols. 21-38; 4 figs.). The relief occupies the entire exposed front of a block of travertine 1.25 m. in width and .95 m. high. The architecture represented may be called Italian Hellenistic, and most of its features are found in real buildings of the kind, at Samothrace, Ephesus, Aosta, Nice, Aix, S. Remy, Verona, Cordova, etc. The Work of the "Societ&amp; Magna Grecia" on Classical and Byzantine Terrain.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 185-196, E. STRONG gives a brief report of the activities of the Societa Magna Grecia in the excavation in Southern Italy and Sicily during the past ten years, notably at Elea, Hipponium, Punta d'Alice, Metapontum, Taren- tum, Himera, Leontini, Agrigentum, and the Sicilian necropolis of S. Angelo Muxaro. Besides these excavations on classical sites the Society has furthered excavation on prehistoric sites, espe- cially at Serra d'Alto, Murgia Timone, and on the promontory of Monte Gargano. Attention has</page><page sequence="18">134 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY been devoted to Byzantine studies in southern Italy, and Mrs. Strong, after citing the earlier work of French scholars in the field, calls attention to the rapid deterioration of the paintings and to the publication of a corpus of them which has been undertaken by the Society. The Antiquities of Christina of Sweden at Rome.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 254-267, F. BOYER publishes a manuscript of the Archives Nationales which gives an inventory, apparently prepared while Christina was still alive, of her collection of ancient statues, busts, and heads, 192 items in all. The queen seems to have taken some pieces with her from Sweden to Rome. Others she purchased, acquired as gifts, or ob- tained by her own excavations. After her death these objects were successively in the possession of Cardinal Azzolino, the Marquis Pompeo Azzolino, the dukes of Bracciano, and Philip V of Spain, who purchased the collection in 1724. Boyer gives a concordance between the statues designated in the inventory and Ricard's Marbres Antiques du Musee du Prado a Madrid. Celebrated Faces of Unknown Personages.-- In R. Arch. xxxvi, 1932, pp. 44-76 (025 figs.), FREDERIK POULSEN discusses a group of heads in the Glyptothek Ny Carlsberg which bear the features of Romans who are unknown. The same people, however, are represented elsewhere and evidently were people of considerable consequence. Poulsen demonstrates most convincingly that two heads (Nos. 655 and 599) are those of mem- bers of the family of the Pisos; another head (No. 658) belongs to the time of Hadrian and is prob- ably that of a member of a senatorial family. The head of a woman (No. 694) is apparently that of Domitia Lucilla, the mother of Marcus Aure- lius, and the head of a man (No. 774) is perhaps that of Constantius Chlorus. A Disputed Passage of Claudius' Letter to the Alexandrians.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 268- 281, H. JANNE would see in the letter of Claudius the earliest document alluding to Christianity, thereby sustaining the proposal of S. Reinach. Janne indicates an apparent relationship between lines 96-100 of the letter, Acts XXIV, 5, and Justin, Dial. with Tryphon, 108. It seems that in 40 A.D. the Christians sent emissaries to spread the faith throughout the world, that in 41 the conservative Jews of Jerusalem became alarmed and sent envoys to the Diaspora to combat the Christian propaganda, and that grave disturb- ances ensued. Claudius seems to have tried to prevent further disturbances by forbidding the movement of Jews of Egypt and Syria. The Topography of the Bucolics of Virgil.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 230-953, L. HERRMANN suggests the following settings for the Bucolics of Virgil: I at Tusculum; II and V at Tibur; IV, VIII, and X at the Palatine, the Arcadia of Evander; III and VII near the mouth of the Mincio; IX on the Via Gallica, halfway between Verona and Brescia; VI at a grotto in Naples. He would identify the Bianor whose tomb is mentioned in IX with the epigrammatist of that name. The topography suggested would agree with the identification of the persons in the Bucolics as proposed in Herrmann's Les Masques et les Visages dans les Bucoliques de Virgile (1930). Originality of Latin Poetry.-In Anuarul of Institutul de Studii Clasice al Universitdtii "Regele Ferdinand I" in Cluj (Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj), Vol. I, pp. 3/32, V. BOGREA defends the originality of Latin poetry by pointing out the significance of the early poets before the introduction of Greek influence, the satire and the elegy as works developed chiefly under Latin influence. He points out that the Romans translated and adapted more than they blindly imitated. Identifications of Persons in the Tristes. -Ibid., pp. 33-48, ST. BEZDECHI considers the identification of certain persons mentioned in the Tristes of Ovid. Thus he decides with Lorentz that Brutus was the editor of the collec- tion and he makes several other identifications. Catullus LXIV.-Ibid., pp. 49-53, TEODOR A. NAUM believes that many of the difficulties in Poem LXIV of Catullus can be explained by conceding independent poetic inspiration to the poet and that we do not need to look for models and translations so carefully as many scholars have done. BULGARIA The Attic Grave Stele in Bulgaria.-The grave stele of Anaxandros in the museum at Sofia, the upper part of which from the knees up was found in the harbor of Sozopolis (Apollonia on the Black Sea) in 1895, has been completed by the discovery of the lower part in the spring of 1930. The stele is of the same tall, narrow archaic-Greek type as that of Alxenor in Athens, and represents in profile a mature man leaning on a staff and looking down at his dog, whom he is tempting with the</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 193-2 135 foot of some small animal held in his right hand. The work is lifelike and expressive. The relief surface measures 1.89 m. in height and the whole stone 2.40 m. It lacks the acroterion which was attached by dowels, but includes a roughly finished lower portion about .18 m. deep, which was buried in the ground. (S. VILKOV, Arch. Anz. 1932, pt. 1/2, cols. 97-100; fig.) RUMANIA Prehistoric Graves at Valea lui Mihai.-In the Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 73-80, Dr. M. ROSKA describes some prehistoric graves discovered at Valea lui Mihai. The bodies have been burned and placed in subterranean receptacles in the graves. Among articles found are a mass of obsidian with some chips as if manufacture was going on at this spot, pieces of pottery, usually Stichverzierte Keramik. The most of the remains are probably eneolithic, although some are conservative neolithic finds. Eneolithic Cemetery.-In the Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 89-101, ST. Kovies discusses an eneolithic cemetery at Decia Muresului. Fifteen graves were found, and in several skeletons the skulls had been tre- panned and there were signs of ochre around the bones. There were very few signs of metal in the graves and the pottery were quite ordinary for the locality. Religious Syncretism.-In the Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 81-88, C. DAICOVICIU publishes a collection of inscrip- tions on altars found at Sarmizegetusa in Dacia that illustrate religious syncretism. Thus we have an altar to Invicto Deo Serapidi, another where Sol Invictus (Mithras) is included in a list of Roman deities, OE3 'Tlro-T~ W7Tr)lKbo, Fortunae Daciarum, etc. Inscriptions from Mera.-Ibid., pp. 109-111, MIH. I. MACREA publishes two Latin inscriptions from Mera, County of Cluj. The second contains when restored the rather unusual epithets of Diana Vera et Bona, perhaps as a result of religious syncretism. Dacian Monuments.-In the Annual of the Institute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 112-126, C. DAICOVICIU studies some unpublished monu- ments of Dacia. The first of these is a Dacian funeral monument ending in a pyramid and somewhat similar to the Pfleilergrabmiler of Belgium and Germany. The differences in the Dacian specimens are probably due to direct influence from Asia Minor and the monuments themselves seem to be the work of a collegium of lapidarii. He also studies a long series of Dacian monuments of Liber and Libera. In this case beside Liber is a Silenus and Liber has many of the elements of Dionysos. He also publishes a funeral monument from Apulum in which there is a peacock in the upper part of the design as a symbol of death. This is a result of oriental influence. Coins at Cluj.-Ibid., pp. 127-139, MIH. I. MACREA studies a collection of coins at Cluj and several coins that have been also found at places in Dacia. Bridge of Trajan at Turnu-Severin.-Ibid., pp. 140-177, A. DECEI makes a very serious and complete study of the bridge erected by Trajan over the Danube at Turnu-Severin. He brings together in this article the history of the events that decided Trajan to build the bridge, the career of the architect Apollodorus of Damas- cus, the data that we have on the bridge from the Column of Trajan and various coins. He studies also the questions of the changes made in the camps and the bridge by Constantine the Great and Justinian and summarizes the units that we know were garrisoned in and around the bridge. The bridge seems to have been built along the general lines favored by Vitruvius, but unfor- tunately we have not the detailed account given by Apollodorus. There is no agreement as to the destruction of the bridge, but the author, on the basis of examinations made in 1909, believes that fire had much to do with its disappearance. JUGOSLAVIA A New Statuette of the Athena Parthenos.- A marble statuette of the Athena Parthenos, which was found in November, 1931, a few miles from Monastir (Heraclia Lyncestis) in the ex- treme southern part of Jugoslavia, is published and discussed by H. SCHRADER in Arch. Anz. 1932, pt. 1/12 (cols. 89-97; 3 figs.). The figure, now in private possession but destined for the Belgrade Museum, is between the Varvakion and the Lenormant statuette in size, having a ratio of 1:20 to the original. The head is preserved, but the lower right arm with its attribute is missing. The work is carefully (lone, by a competent hand,</page><page sequence="20">136 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and preserves to a remarkable degree the monu- mental character of the statue, in particular the even balance of parts about a clearly fixed central axis, as well as many details. AUSTRIA The Willendorf Finds.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, Vol. LXII, No. VI, 1932, pp. 349-360 (with 1 text fig. and 5 plates), RICHARD PITTIONI writes about the hitherto unpublished stone in- dustry from the well-known Palaeolithic station in Austria, famous for its "Venus." There are two sites at Willendorf, both located in brick yards. The artifacts were found in both places, but there is no explanation of the circum- stances of their discovery. Their stratigraphic position is not known. Hence, the author re- stricts his article to that material which is now placed in the Prehistoric Institute of the Viennese University. The stone objects are predominantly of the "Klingentechnik" (blade) variety. There are large flakes, cutting blades, gravers, notched points, scrapers, borers and miscellaneous small pieces. Typologically, this material represents the Late Aurignacian period, comparable in time sequence to phases 4 and 5 of the Western European system. Two Bell Beakers from Northwest Pannonia.-- In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, Vol. LXII, No. VI, 1932, pp. 367-370 (with 3 text figs.), FRIEDRICH HAUT- MANN describes two chaliciform vessels from East Austria. Both represent the common Central European type. Although only undocumented chance finds, the author takes them as important marks of the geographic route from the Bohemio- Moravian Bell Beaker area through Austria to the Southeast as far as central Hungary and the Tissa River valley. GERMANY Exhibition of Jewelry at Berlin.-In the exhi- bition of jewelry of many periods recently held at the Old Museum many ancient pieces of great interest were on view, among them earrings of the fourth century, filigree bracelets, silver boxes of Scythian provenience, a headdress of the third century from Abdera, gay with ivy enamelled in colors and set with garnets. Especially inter- esting is the hoard from Pedescia in the Sabine Hills, consisting of jewels owned by a family of the time of Augustus. The Byzantine and Mediaeval display includes lunulae, gold neck- laces, pendants and other pieces of great magnifi- cence. (Illustrated London News, Dec. 3, 193R, pp. 884-5.) SPAIN Plaques of the Cult of Sabazios coming from Ampurias.-In R. Arch. xxxvi, 1932, pp. 35-43, ADRIEN BRUHL gives an interpretation of two bronze plaques found in a grave at Ampurias in Spain. One represents Sabazios with the essential attributes of his cult and accompanied by Dionysos and Hermes. Stars indicate the celestial world. A woman in a grotto before a flame is probably a priestess, and another woman holding a babe is pictured in a second grotto. The second plaque on which one of the Dioscuri appears is probably not unrelated to the first. Bruhl points out that this is the first evidence of the cult of Sabazios in Spain. NORWAY Stone-Age Art of Scandinavia.-At Vingen, north of Bergen, in Western Norway, the Keeper of Antiquities in the Museum at Bergen has discovered and made drawings of some eight hundred engravings in the rock walls along the fjord and the river. They date from about 2000 B.C. Most of them represent red deer, usually singly, but occasionally in groups as large as 135; human figures, crudely rendered, also appear. Some objects not seen elsewhere apparently represent contrivances for catching or killing the animals. (J. B6*E in The Illustrated London News, Dec. 17, 1932, pp. 986-7.) GEORGIA Archaeological Finds in Georgia in 1930.-In Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, Vol. LXII, Nos. I and II, 193R, pp. 109-109 (with 18 figs. in text), SERGE MAKALATHIA describes certain bronzes and ceramics discovered in the provinces of Kharthli, Gori, and Kakh6ti. The material includes axes, daggers, swordS, spear points, buckles, and tripod vessels, all made of bronze, and is assigned to the artistic Koban-Samtavro phase of the Caucasian Bronze Age, dated approximately to the thir- teenth century B.C. Although a reference is made to five pottery pieces (all illustrated in the text), their cultural positions or dates are not given. Still, the article is welcome news of the promising archaeological activities in so important a region as Georgia.</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 193V 137 EUROPE GENERAL On the Use of Ancient "Sieve-Vessels."-JIn Mit. Anth. Ges. Wien, Vol. LXII, No. III, 193N, pp. 217-222 (with 1 text illus.), WILLVONSEDER discusses the function of archaeological "sieve- vessels" in Europe. These are colander-like perforated ceramic or metal utensils which differ from the "true sieve" receptacles in one impor- tant aspect: they are not closed off with a bottom. While the true strainers are generally considered to have a purely kitchen-utilitarian purpose, the use of the "sieve-vessels" (multi-perforated, top- open covers) has been interpreted in widely differing ways. Both types are found in Euro- pean archaeology from the Neolithic period upward through the scale of culture history. Following Gdtze's classification of "sieve- vessels" (Ebert, Reallexikon, XII, p. 82, sec. 7), the author lists and describes a series of specimens from central and southeastern Europe. He then reviews briefly the explanations advanced for these vessels, which range from no recognition of any differences between the true sieve and the cover, to the conceptions of such functions as: cheesemaking receptacles, incense burners, pot- stands, honey-gathering vessels, lamps. The quite prevalent "lamp" idea was subscribed to by Wossinsky (in Lengyel, II, p. 12), who later changed his opinion and declared the "sieve- vessels" to be flame covers (Tolnavdrmegye, pl. XLVI). The author accepts this and explains how the vessel functions in actual application as a protec- tor to the flame which receives air through the perforations and may be fueled through the open top. He admits a possible secondary use of these vessels as incense burners, but rejects any other functions claimed for them. Existing evidence of a direct association of these flame protecting covers with fire hearths is well estab- lished. THE UNITED STATES AND ALASKA The Archaeology of Environment in Eastern North America.-In Am. Anth., Vol. 34, No. 4, October-December, 1932, pp. 610-629 (3 tables), P. B. SEARS discusses the relationship of extinct aboriginal cultures to post-glacial climatic condi- tions. He correlates the discontinuity in archae- ological remains with the known fluctuations in climate and offers a tentative chronology which appears to correspond with that of Northern Europe. An interesting example is given in the diffusion of the Hopewell culture (Mid-western mounds) eastward (where it was both preceded and followed by more primitive developments), which is correlated with the shifting of the corn optimum as the result of a recent warm, dry climate. The author has made good use of the pollen analysis method (qualitative determination of fossil pollen found in peat deposits and its floral reconstruction) and suggests the importance of checking deposits containing pollen which may have important bearing on the dating of the associated cultural remains. Origin and Development of the Burial Mound. -In Am. Anth., Vol. 34, No. 2, April-June, 1932, pp. 286-295, E. F. GREENMAN discusses the inter- esting question regarding the origin of burial mounds in America. Considering three possibil- ities, namely, the objective, the subjective, and the force of interplay of these two, as the major explanations, the writer expands on each one of these and concludes that burying in mounds is to be attributed to the following circumstances: (1) high regard for the sanctity of the grave, ("2) pro- tection from human or animal vandalism (prompted by 1), (3) conscious conception or accidental suggestion of the mound, (4) accept- ance of the mound as a solution to avoid difficult digging through the hardpan (the impervious layer immediately below topsoil). The so-called Adena type of mounds, char- acterized by large tombs located under the floor level of tumuli, exemplify a transitional develop- ment between plain pit graves and mound burials. Once established as a culture trait, the practice of burying in mounds continued through the operation of factors additional to the original adoption of the custom. The Algonkin Sequence in New York.-In Am. Anth., Vol. 34, No. 3, July-September, 1932, pp. 406-414 (9 plates), W. A. RITCHIE describes the material culture and, in so far as possible, also the physical characteristics of the aborigines of the state of New York who fall within the so- called Algonkin Period. Following A. C. Par- ker's accepted triple classification, the author modifies the Second Period as being probably based on derivations from the Southeast, and considers the Third Period to be a local develop- ment from the Second with a strong admixture of Iroquoian traits.</page><page sequence="22">138 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY The First Period (Archaic) is without pottery, polished celts, copper and worked shells. Char- acteristic implements include the faceted adze, celt scraper, cylindrical pestle, shallow mortar and muller, hammerstones, notched sinkers, straight, stemmed and notched arrow, javelin, and spear heads, knife blades, variety of bone and antler implements, beaver tooth knives and certain prob- lematic forms. While skeletal remains are in- sufficient to warrant definite conclusions, the longheaded type has been ascertained. The geo- graphic distribution of this type of culture spreads from lower Ontario through northern Ohio into eastern Pennsylvania and throughout the course of the Susquehanna, as well as lower New Eng- land. The writer suspects that it is to be found even further southward than Pennsylvania. The Second Period material reveals marked influences from the Southeast. It is distinct from the preceding type partially in superimposed stratigraphy and above all, in radical differences in individual traits, both cultural and physical. Characteristic are grooved axes, gorgets, Canner- stones, sinew stones, grooved mauls, choppers, marine shell beads, and pottery. Pointed-bot- tomed vessels, made of poorly washed clays, embellished with twig and textile impressions and punctate design, are typical. Crude ceramic pipes, steatite, hematite, some native copper, notched and barbed arrow-, javelin-, and spear- points, and polished slates are also present. The associated crania are brachycephalic. Many of these elements show affinities with the South Atlantic (Muskogean) and the Mississippi- Ohio (Mound Builders) areas. The writer be- lieves that the region about Chesapeake bay was the center of amalgamation of the Archaic Algon- kin culture type with the southeastern pattern and that a reflux brought it from there north- ward. The historic survival of the Coastal Algonkin tribes indicates that the ethnic stock remained the same. In addition to New York State, the Second Period Algonkin distribution extended to coastal New England and as far north as Nova Scotia. The advance of the Iroquois northward oc- casioned the development recognized as the Third Algonkin Period. Marked changes in ceramics, lithic industry, and in racial aspects document this process. In pottery, the straight line design and the herringbone pattern predominated. The rounded-bottom vessel, an Iroquoian characteris- tic, was adopted. The most distinguishable stone trait, the triangular arrowhead, also originally an Iroquois product, became typical. Although stemmed points are relatively rare, the general run of stone and bone implements is similar to those of the Second Period. The elbow type of clay pipe now reached its highest development and the bone harpoon with a single or double row of barbs became an important artifact. On the other hand, such traits as grooved axes, gouges, plummets, polished slates, ocean shell beads, and copper disappeared. The Algonkin culture was gradually submerged by the dominance of the Iroquois. An Indian Mound in West Virginia.-In Mus. J. (Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXI, Nos. 3-4, Sep- tember-December, 1930, pp. 133-187, page plates I-XXV, CHARLES BACHE and LINTON SATTER- THWAITE, JR. report the excavation of an Indian mound at Beech Bottom, West Virginia. The article, in its first part, consists in greatly detailed description, constantly illuminated by plans in section and elevation telling the story of the excavation which took place from July 3 to Aug- ust 4, 1930. The mound, broadly speaking a cone, averages 22 m. in diameter at the base, and its greatest height from the general surrounding ground level about 4 m. The study seems to indicate that the mound was erected for a single burial in times before the coming of the Euro- peans. The body, ornamented all over with copper and shell beads, and probably covered with bark, lay in an oval hole on its back, hands at sides, legs somewhat bowed, with one ankle above the other. Over this was a layer of yellow sand; and then the grave was filled with dark earth. Hematite celts, broken blades, broken tubes and broken animal bones were thrown on or in this dark earth. A third layer of dark earth was then spread over the grave and the oval ridge of sand around it, with its objects. The outer portions of this dark layer merged beyond the sand with a layer of dark material (from the Ohio River bottom?) laid down before the digging of the grave, forming a kind of dark disk. Then a large ring of yellow surface soil was deposited around the whole, gradually rising until it formed a kind of crater. As it encroached over the disk there was a mixture made of the dark material giv- ing a pebbled effect in the cross section. Finally, instead of completely closing, the "crater" en- closed a mass of dark soil continuous with the dark covering of the sand in a kind of funnel- shaped core. In filling in, the builders deposited</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 139 caches of blades, single blades, celts, slate gorget and pendant, miscellaneous natural stone ob- jects. Much red ochre was scattered about, in lumps or smeared on blades. River mussel shells, and particularly broken straight tubes which the authors believe to have been tobacco pipes, were common. These "pipes" contained in one or two instances a clay pellet which could not fall through the small orifice at one end (like a hole through a node of bamboo). Chemical analysis of the charred residue in these tubes supports the theory that they were used for smoking. This culture seems, by process of elimination, to be Adena or a local variant of it. The periph- eral ring and the evidently ceremonial use of dark earth seem to be unique in the eastern part of the Mississippi area. Its closest affinities are probably to be sought in the little known Kana- wha Valley region of West Virginia. The plates illustrating the finds are indispen- sable to any proper understanding of the work, and they are most excellently produced and reproduced. Excavations in the Guadalupe Mountains.-- In Mus. J. (Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXI, Nos. 3-4, September-December, 1930, pp. 198-202, page plates Nos. XXVI-XXXVII, EDGAR B. HOWARD reports archaeological research in the Guadalupe Mountains (in Eddy County, New Mexico, and Culbertson County, Texas). A number of caves were investigated; three were partially excavated, only one of which had been practically undisturbed before the expe- dition. The material recovered consists of baskets, fragments of baskets, several types of sandals (all these of yucca leaves), pieces of twine-woven bags and matting, a few spear and arrow fore- shafts, bone awls, corn cobs, wooden objects such as wedges, sherds of undecorated gray-black pottery, and a number of animal bones notably of the Pleistocene bison, horse, and a rather rare antelope, tetrameryx shuleri, besides the bones of a large stork-like bird. A few human bones were also recovered. Certain of this material resem- bles very closely specimens of Basket-Maker work from other parts of the S.W.,-notably the twined woven bag and the spear foreshafts; other objects are different. For the present it seems unwise to attempt any definite assignment of this culture to a place in the general picture. The plates are excellent in the clarity of their photography and the exactness with which they present the appearance of the cave localities and the more significant objects unearthed. Work in Caves of the Guadalupe Mountains of New Mexico was continued last spring under the joint auspices of the University Museum and the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, with Mr. Edgar B. Howard, of the Museum in charge. A number of new caves were explored, and these yielded some skeletal material, sandals, grooved sticks, cordage, hair rope, and so forth. The principal work, however, was carried on in a cave that had been the site of investigations in the two preceding seasons. The excavation of this par- ticular cave was completed this year by Mr. Howard with the able help of Mr. R. M. Burnet of Carlsbad. Two more Basket-Maker burials were uncovered, in one of which was a broken atlatl. A number of deep hearths were encoun- tered at depths down to nearly nine feet, and in some of these were buried animal bones. Bones of the musk-ox, bison, horse, and several species of small mammal, as well as bones of the Cali- fornia condor were also found this year. A site, southeast of Clovis, New Mexico, which was ap- parently the bed of an old lake, yielded several broken Folsom points, and by going through local collections previously made at or near this place, a total of twenty-five points were found, some as beautifully chipped as the type specimens. The site offers interesting possibilities and the Museum expects to follow up this opportunity at the ear- liest possible moment. (University Museum Bul- letin, December, 1932.) The Age of Lead Glaze Decorated Pottery in the Southwest.--In Am. Anth., Vol. 34, No. 3, July-September, 1932, pp. 418-425 (1 text fig.), E. W. HAURY discusses the important and in- teresting questions of the time status and the time criteria of lead glaze technique in the South- west. This refers to glaze painting, not to glaz- ing of entire walls of vessels, the distinction being very important in relation to the question of origin. The writer shows conclusively that lead glaze painting in the Southwest is datable to a period anterior to the arrival of the Spaniards. With the aid of the tree ring dating method, its presence may be dated as early as 1290 (over two centuries before Hispanic contacts). The chronological sig- nificance of lead glaze painting lies in its relatively short existence. It defines a fairly definite period in the history of the Pueblo ceramics and when found outside of its original area it indicates definite contacts with regions in which it was so prominent.</page><page sequence="24">140 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Excavations in Alaska.-The third season of archaeological investigations in southwestern Alaska, conducted by Frederica de Laguna, of the University Museum, Philadelphia, was spent chiefly at one site in Kachemak Bay, Cook Inlet. At this place are remains of five occupations, from the modern Athabaskan Indian village, inhabited only fifty years ago, to the lowest of four prehis- toric Eskimo deposits, now all buried under beach gravel. The land has sunk about 15 feet since the first habitation. The archaeological material shows a development of the Kachemak Bay culture through three or four stages. Al- though this culture was basically Eskimo, and is closely related to that of the Pacific Eskimo and Aleuts when first discovered, it contains a rich mixture of Indian elements, especially in the third or final stage. These seem to link the Cook Inlet Eskimo with the prehistoric Indians of British Columbia. This third stage in Kachemak Bay also seems to be analogous to that of the Punuk phase found by Collins on St. Lawrence Island. Apparently the basis of the Kachemak Bay culture was a rather generalized Eskimo culture, in which a number of types known from the Thule culture of Canada played an impor- tant part. This supports Mathiassen's thesis that a Thule, or we should probably say, a Thule- like culture was the basis of all the Alaskan phases. Thus, the harpoon heads of the first period in Kachemak Bay are all of the simplest Thule type, and in none of the stages do the elaborate Old Bering Sea, Punuk, or Birnirk forms appear. A great many of the Kachemak Bay types belong to all the North Pacific region from Neolithic Japan on the one hand to south- ern British Columbia, or even further south, on the other. The chief differences between the three stages of culture are in the stone technique, which shows a transition from chipping to polishing and sawing. Grooved and notched stones also show a develop- ment. To the lower part of the third or last stage of the Kachemak Bay culture belong the stone lamps with a human figure in the bowl, as was proved by the finding of such a lamp in situ. This discovery supports J. Alden Mason's theory of an Eskimo origin for these lamps. The style of the decoration, however, is closely paralleled by that of the stone vessels with human figures from southern British Columbia. It seems likely that the plain knobs found in Thule culture lamps and on archaeological lamps from southwestern Alaska have been elaborated into the human figure under Indian influence from the south. A lamp with whales in the bowl is also known from Kachemak Bay. The most interesting art of these Eskimo was painting on the walls of rock shelters and caves. The pictures in three such caves on lower Cook Inlet were traced. They are apparently made of hematite mixed with animal fat, and are all in silhouette. They depict men in umiaks and kayaks, bears or anthropomorphic figures, whales of several different types, seals or other sea mam- mals, some with bladder-darts in their sides, a swan, etc. Such paintings are also found on Kodiak Island, where the archaeological culture was very similar to that of Kachemak Bay. It is possible, to judge by reports of the natives, that these pictures were connected with hunting magic, and were, perhaps, made by the whale-killers. (See also University Museum Bulletin, December, 1932.) CENTRAL AMERICA Excavations at Piedras Negras, Guatemala.- The Eldridge R. Johnson Expedition of the Uni- versity Museum, Philadelphia, continued its excavations for the second year at the site of the Maya "Old Empire" city of Piedras Negras in Guatemala. The personnel consisted of J. Alden Mason as field director, Linton Satter- thwaite, Jr., as assistant director, Fred P. Parris as architect, Mary Butler, and David W. Amram, Jr. Dr. Mason and Mr. Satterthwaite superin- tended excavating gangs, Mr. Parris surveyed the site and drew up a map, and Miss Butler studied ceramics, stratigraphy, and art development. One phase of the work concerned the exporta- tion of the massive monuments. Stelae 13, 14, and 40, Lintel 12, and one leg of Altar 4, con- signed according to the contract with the Guate- malan Government to Philadelphia, and Stelae 6, 15, 33, and 36, Lintel 4, and three legs of Altar 4, consigned to Guatemala, were transported to the end of the road where they await proper conditions to be brought down the Usumacinta River. Stela 12, taken over the road in 1931, is now erected in the University Museum, as are Lintel 3, brought to Philadelphia in 1931, and Throne 1, brought to the Museum this year. Excavations were conducted in the three prin- cipal groups of the city: the West, East, and South Groups. In the West Group the great modified hill known as the Acropolis was carefully investi-</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 141 gated, though not completely excavated, and af- forded important information on Maya architec- ture and architectural development. In this region a burial vault was found in which were remains of several persons, one of them obviously of high rank. This was surrounded by orna- ments of jade, shell, and bone (some of them with incised glyphs), a large hematite mosaic mirror and other objects of adornment. In a prominent situation on the Acropolis, at the head of a monumental stairway and over- looking a court, were found the fragments of a throne which consists of a table supported by two legs and a rear screen which stood at the back of the table. The front edge of the table and the legs bear glyphs containing the date of erection. The screen seems to be a conventionalized ser- pent-face with the eyes cut through. In each eye is a free-standing human bust. This is the first throne recognized as such in the Maya area and is of the more importance inasmuch as it indicates that the scene shown in Lintel 3, in which a simi- lar throne is portrayed in use, represents an actual ceremony at Piedras Negras. The throne, however, bears a date twenty-five years later than the lintel. Pyramids K-5 and 0-13, formerly termed struc- tures 42 and 27 respectively, the summit temples of which were cleared in 1931, were deeply exca- vated, revealing in both cases earlier structures which had been buried by later accretions. In the former instance, two buried structures were found at successively lower levels, and another may underlie these. The lowest of these struc- tures is of especial interest inasmuch as it consists of one of the widest rooms known in the Early Maya region, five meters in width, and could have been covered only by a roof of timber. In the South Group the ball-court was com- pletely excavated, giving for the first time a de- tailed plan of one of these interesting structures, which until recently were supposed to be missing in the Early Maya region. One large pyramid in the South Group and one smaller mound in this group and one in the East Group were superfi- cially cleared and studied. Another important discovery was that of Lintel 1'2, which bears the earliest date so far discovered at this city: 9.4.0.0.0, A.D. 514, according to the Goodman-Thompson correlation. This lintel had been broken up and re-used in the masonry of temple O-13, the relief decoration completely covered by a coating of stucco. Discoveries in Guatemala.-The continuity of Maya religious ritual is striking: on obsidian flakes dating between 185 and 609 A.D. is engraved the "Long-Nosed God," the supreme deity as lord of earth, rain, and fertility, and in the three codices which date just before the Spanish con- quest appears again the same god in nearly iden- tical dress, a survival of over a thousand years. An interesting piece of sculpture at Santa Lucia shows the snake-god holding two human hearts and about to accept another from a priest who has a sacrificial knife in his right hand. A second priest brings part of a thigh-bone and a small child as offerings, and birds of prey feeding on human heads complete the scene. A burial in a mound in this region, perhaps of one of the priests, contained two large superimposed urns, the upper part of a femur separated from the lower, a horseshoe-shaped stone yoke, a sculptured plaque showing a bird of prey with its beak in the eye-socket of a human skull, an obsidian knife, a string of jade beads, and other objects. Nearby were found fragments of pottery censers which are thought to have been burned at the ceremony and then intentionally broken. Double seated female figurines and other figurines which show some indication of the cause of the subject's death, such as a swollen abdomen or cheek, were also found.

(Univ. of Penna.), Vol. XXII, No. 2, June, 1931, pp. 154-183 (10 page plates), MARY BUTLER dis- cusses Dress and Decoration of the Old Maya Empire. A study is made of the existing Maya Old Empire monuments in an attempt to furnish critical data for evaluating pottery and jades. The irreducible minimum of Maya garb was head- dress, neck ornament, and girdle or loin cloth. The plates illustrate these universal features, as well as the additional capes, skirts, sandals, leg and arm bands, that appear sporadically and which, together with varieties in the type of the universal costume, are characteristic of individual localities. Headdresses are mainly of two types: turban and mask. Neckwear varies from simple jadeite beads to cape-like feather creations. Nearly every sculptured figure carries some ob- ject of practical use or religious significance; in the article these are listed and described at some length. There then follows a series of paragraphs devoted each to a locality and giving a study of the costumes peculiar to each.

EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL The Originality of Byzantine Art.-In R. Arch. xxxv, 1932, pp. 282-288, L. BREiHIER gives a resume of Guyer's Vonz Wesen der Byzantinischer Kunst (1931) and discusses Guyer's theory of two distinct styles of Byzantine art, at Byzantium and regions under its influence, a breaking with ancient tradition, at Antioch a survival of Hellen- istic art. Br6hier would see oriental influence in the art and architecture of Byzantium, and in the style of Antioch the classical survival due to the fact that Antioch was more than Byzantium a Hellenistic capital. Polychromy and Sculpture in the First Roman- esque Style.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 75-99 (32 figs.), J. PuIG I CADAFALCH completes his study, "Decorative Forms of the First Roman- esque Style," begun in Art Studies, iv, 1926, and continued in vi, 1928. Two particular subjects are dealt with here: polychromy, its origin and use and the methods employed in producing it; and sculpture for surface decoration, not for structural function. In discussing the latter the decorative elements are described and their origin accounted for. There are three main sources of the motives: the primitive, indigenous themes proceeding from a pre-Roman tradition; those diffused by manuscripts and stuffs of east- ern origin; and those of patterns which, spread throughout the whole Carolingian Empire, were meant to imitate the sumptuous embroideries of the epoch. Figure sculpture was done in many schools and by various methods. In all of the First Romanesque Style one important fact stands out: sculpture occurred sporadically in primitive Romanesque churches and its develop- ment and geographic distribution did not coincide with those of architecture. At the conclusion of this article there is a summary of the earlier parts of the discussion and a brief consideration of the relation of the First Romanesque Style to the Second. ASIA MINOR Turkish Architecture in Southwestern Anatolia. -In Art Studies, viii, 1, 1930, pp. 89-165, and 2, 1931, pp. 173-2F2F (159 figs.), R. M. RIEFSTAHL presents a preliminary account of an expedition to Smyrna, Manissa, Birgeh, Tireh, Aidin, Antalia, and Alaya. Part I contains descriptions of the monuments and of their decorative details with many illustrations; Part II consists chiefly of Turkish inscriptions from different places repro- duced, described, translated into English and German, and commented upon by the author. ITALY Byzantine Survivals.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 215-221 (15 figs.), G. GEROLA assigns some twenty churches in and near Ravenna to what he calls the deuterobyzantine type-that is, late Byzantine style persisting into the Roman- esque period. These churches have mostly been ascribed either to the earlier Byzantine or to the Neo-Byzantine period; Gerola, however, recog- nizes them as examples of this interesting survival style which is found in architecture only in Ra- venna, though in painting it exists throughout Italy. The principal churches described are S. Michele in Acervoli presso S. Arcangelo, S. Sal- vatore in Calchi, S. Maria in Porto Fuori, S. Pietro Maggiore and S. Vittore, all at Ravenna. The article summarizes the main points discussed in detail in a larger study of the subject by the same author published in Ricordi di Ravenna Medioe- vale, per il sesto centenario della morte di Dante. Ravenna, 1921. Mediaeval Painting at Verona.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 159-167 (25 figs.), E. S. VAVALX describes the artistic position of Verona in the Dugento as dependent upon two considerations: her nearness to the source of incoming Roman- esque influence from the other side of the Alps and her relative nearness to Venice, center of the Byzantinizing movement. The pictures that re- main from this period of mixed influences are fragmentary and mutilated so that it is impos- sible to reconstruct from them artistic person- alities or even consecutive phases or movements. The material presented in this study, however, serves to exemplify the mixed character of the period. The principal monuments described are the frescoed grotto of S. Nazaro, the S. Zeno fres- coes, especially the great picture in the Tower, frescoes from the Churches of S. Fermo and S. Giovanni in Fonte, and several detached frag- ments in the Museo Civico. A New Group of Byzantine-Venetian Trecento Pictures.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 3-31 (929 figs.), V. LASAREFF, using a Crucifixion in the Stoclet Collection as a nucleus, builds up a group</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 143 of pictures with common style characteristics, which presumably come from the same work- shop. Within this general group there seem to be subgroups based on individual peculiarities which suggest six different artists working under the same general tradition in the first half of the fourteenth century-a tradition whose outstand- ing characteristic is its retention of strong By- zantine influence and its freedom from Gothic. None of the pictures is dated, but as they are associated in style with the mosaics of the Baptis- tery of S. Marco, Venice, they may be given the date of the latter, 134Q-1354. To complete the group, the mosaics in the chapel of S. Isidor in S. Marco must be added because of stylistic resem- blances to the Baptistery mosaics. The re- miainder of this study is concerned with an at- tempt to determine the chronological sequence of the pictures on the basis of a careful stylistic analysis and to ascertain whether the artists making up this workshop were Greeks or their Italian pupils. A significant fact bearing on the latter question is the existence in Murano in the first half of the fourteenth century of a workshop of Greeks who had Italians as pupils and who turned out both icons and mosaics; their style was eclectic-a mixture of Byzantine and Italian ele- ments. To this school undoubtedly belongs the above group of paintings and mosaics. Two Crucifixes of the Campania in the Eleventh Century.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, Fasc. XII, 19392, pp. 925-932 (5 figs.), A. O. QUINTAVALLE de- scribes two early Romanesque wooden crucifixes in Naples which represent the very technique described by Theophilus as combining the use of gesso and polychromy with sculpture. The figures in their present condition, therefore, are only the skeletons of the original forms. The earlier one, in S. Maria Maggiore, was probably made for this church and placed there in the eleventh century. In the heavy, slightly-mod- elled figure and the coarse features it shows a striving after massiveness and solidity which is foreign to the Byzantine tradition and which, with its faults and mannerisms, clearly points to a regional style. Other examples of this style exist in the carved wooden doors of S. Maria in Cellis at Carsoli, the four wooden shutters of S. Maria Maggiore at Alatri, and an ivory altar-front in the Duomo at Salerno. The second crucifix, in S. Giorgio Maggiore, is considerably later; the form of Christ is more attenuated and the modelling less rude, but it shows a style and technique simi- lar to the others with the addition, however, of a finer spiritual feeling in the expression of the face. Norman Sculpture in Sicily.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 452-475 (14 figs.), L. BIAGI continues his study of the cloister of Monreale begun in L'Arte, xxxiv, 1931, taking up the sculpture of the earlier Norman period and tracing the influence which determined its character. Of primary importance in this period is the cathedral of Cefalfl the sculptured capitals of which must antedate 1148 when the mosaics were finished, and must, therefore, represent the earliest original sculpture of the Norman period in Sicily. The chief ele- ments of this style are Lombard Romanesque and Byzantine; the motives are Oriental monsters adapted from textiles to sculpture under restrain- ing classical influence. The same style developed with a stronger Hellenistic character is found in the cloister of Monreale where some of the artists at work were probably educated in Greece. Toward the end of the twelfth century more fre- quent contacts with south Italy introduced cer- tain mannerisms of style which mingled with further infiltrations of Lombard Romanesque and of French. At the same time some artists were still carving capitals in the Byzantine style. This mixture of influences gave Sicilian art in the Nor- man period a distinct character of its own. RUMANIA Gothic Weapons.-In the Annual of the In- stitute of Classical Studies at the University of King Ferdinand I at Cluj, Vol. I, pp. 69-72, Dr. M. ROSKA publishes two swords, a spur and some other objects found at Valea lui Mihai in the county of Salaj. These are apparently Gothic in style. The swords are somewhat shorter than the usual type and the tomb can be dated by a gold coin of Theodosius II (408-450). SPAIN A Sixth Century Fresco at Egara.-In Butlleti dels Museus d'Art de Barcelona, ii, 1932, 11, pp. 97-105 (6 figs.), J. P. I CADAFALCH describes a partly ruined fresco in the apse of the cathedral of Egara (Terrassa) in Catalunya. The walls of the building belonged to a Visigothic bishopric prob- ably built between 516 and 546 A.D. The build- ing is interesting because it involves Roman meth- ods of construction, while the fresco, both in ico- nography and decorative motives shows strong Near Eastern, probably Egyptian, influence.

The Osma Beatus.-In Art Studies, viii, 92, 1931, pp. 103-156 (26 figs.), T. RoJo presents a full descriptive and critical study of one of the most interesting of the Beatus manuscripts, namely, that in the Cathedral of Osma, dated 1056. In addition to a description of the exter- nal features of the manuscript and a textual analysis, all the folios containing miniatures are described as well as the Mapa Mundi. Rojo gives as the provenance of the manuscript, the Monastery of Sta. Maria de Carracedo in the diocese of Astorga. The Beatus Manuscripts.-In Art Studies, viii, 1, 1930, pp. 3-55 (6 pls., 18 figs., 6 of which are colored), Miss G. G. KING discusses the minia- tures in the twenty-four important manuscripts of Beatus' Commentaries on the Apocalypse as ex- pressive of the Spanish temper. There are several main groups distinguished of which the Valcavado is the earliest and most important. San Millan style is easily recognizable because of the use of certain definite details; the Burgensis group is headed by the Morgan manuscript. The copy of Beatus now at Gerona shows strong Eastern influence while that of Egas at Lisbon is Cister- cian. Miss King, after a general description of the contents and history of the manuscripts, takes up each group and studies its stylistic characteristics and their probable sources. One interesting ob- servation arising out of the study of the Beatus manuscripts is the evidence they furnish that Persian-Mesopotamian influence came into Spain by means of manuscripts earlier than any now extant, and that it kept recurring there at suc- cessive periods as is shown by the emphasis on color and on conventionalized design. A chrono- logical descriptive list of all the known Beatus manuscripts concludes the article. A Fragmentary Spanish Altarpiece of the Late Fourteenth Century.-In Butlleti dels Museus d'Art de Barcelona, ii, 9, 1932, pp. 42-49 (8 figs.), A. DURAN I SANTPERE identifies two stone reliefs representing the Nativity and the Presentation of Christ in the Temple together with a statue of the Madonna, all in the Museum of Ciutadella, as parts of an altarpiece formerly in Santa Maria la Vella in Ager. The composition is poor and the technique crude, but the frag- ments are interesting as examples of the popular type of late fourteenth-century Spanish Gothic sculpture. UPPER RHINE Upper Rhenish Painting About 1300.-In the Miinch. Jahrb. Bd. ix, 1932, Heft 1, pp. 17-48 (16 figs.), A. STANGE discusses late thirteenth and early fourteenth century painting of the upper Rhine district with special reference to Zurich and Constance as centers of distinct artistic styles. The two cities, according to Stange, are not to be contrasted in any artistic sense; it can only be said that as far as can be determined Constance showed greater originality. Unfortunately, there is no Zurich work of the fourth and fifth decade of the fourteenth century, so there is nothing to show the transitional step to mysticism there. To judge from Constance, however, it was a quick transition and in the upper Rhine territory did not take such a hold as in the lower-witness the solid monumentality of Conrad Witz a century later. Stange bases his study of upper Rhine painting in the thirteenth century upon three different manuscripts of the Weltchronik at Munich, St. Gall and (formerly) at Wernigerode, probably all painted in the vicinity of the Boden- see, and on the Weingartner Liederhandschrift, from the same district early in the fourteenth century, and the Manassehandschrift illuminated probably in Zurich. The latter seems to have been done by at least four hands, a master and his assistants. The differences between the master of the Manassehandschrift and the painter of the Weingartner Liederhandschrift are due not so much to localized style in Zurich and Constance respec- tively, as to differences in the artists themselves. The closeness of the two artistic centers is sug- gested by the unmistakable interinfluence be- tween them, which is especially evident in some of the lesser artists who worked on the Manasse- handschrift. THE UNITED STATES The Landevennec (Harkness) Gospels.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 225-286 (40 pls.), C. R. MOREY, E. K. RAND and C. H. KRAELING have collaborated in publishing the Gospels manu- script recently presented to the New York Public Library by Mr. E. S. Harkness. The results of their combined studies made respectively from the points of view of illumination, script and text analysis, have enabled them to date the manu- script in the second half of the ninth century and to establish its provenance in the monastery of Landevennec, in the diocese of Quimper, Brittany.</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 145 RENAISSANCE AND MODERN GENERAL Some Aesthetic Values Recorded by the X-Ray. -In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 61-71 (15 figs.), A. BURROUGHS demonstrates the value of X-ray shadowgraphs as guides to the study of style by showing up the fundamental handling of the un- derpainting. By a series of carefully selected figures, Burroughs indicates the scope of such a study: "Graded according to their obviousness, they show: first, the contrast between an original work and its copy; second, an original style and the imitation of it by a less-gifted artist; third, an original conception and an eclectic one; fourth, the comparison between artists who assimilated similar styles to a different degree; and finally, the contrast between paintings which have been con- sidered similar by some critics but which differ fundamentally-in construction." The picture studied in connection with the last point-Leo- nardo's Virgin of the Rocks-shows by means of the X-ray shadowgraphs two distinct techniques, one of which seems to be that of Leonardo, the other that of Ambrogio da Predis. Michaele da Firenze.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, 1932, Fasc. VII, pp. 542-562 (21 figs.), G. FIocco pieces together, from documents and monuments, the career of Michaele da Firenze, skillful and charming maker of terracotta reliefs. From the style of his panels of the Nativity and the Adora- tion of the Magi at Santa Anastasia at Verona, he was called at one time a Veronese under Tuscan influence; but the unquestionable similarity be- tween the Nativity and a relief of the same sub- ject by Arnolfo for the old facade of the Duomo at Florence, and between the Adoration of the Magi at Verona and one of Ghiberti's first doors for the Baptistery, establish him once for all as a Florentine. Still more striking is the similarity between a panel of the Nativity over a window formerly in the Istituto dei Buoni Fanciulli at Verona and the Nativity on the same doors of Ghiberti. It seems that Michaele in his early youth then (about 1403) was a pupil of Ghiberti; from 1430-31 he was at Arezzo, where he made the beautiful wall tomb decoration for Francesco Rozzelli. From 1433-38 he was at Verona, when the Santa Anastasia reliefs were modelled, and in 1441 he is recorded to have been in Ferrara and shortly afterward (1442) doubtless made the Altar delle Statuine at Modena. A similar work but much more elaborate was formerly in the Duomo at Adria, of which only fragments remain now. Various smaller works, such as the Madonna in the Victoria and Albert Museum, are charming examples of his style. Michaele was one of the most immediate channels by which Florentine influence passed into the North to initiate the Renaissance there. Jacopino del Conte.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 332-337 (2 figs.), A. VENTURI clears up the attribution to Michelangelo of a Madonna and Angels in the National Gallery, by restor- ing it to Jacopino del Conte on the basis of its stylistic similarities to the Preaching of St. John in the Oratorio di S. Giovanni Decollato, at Rome. The Art of Mathias Griinewald.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 200-220 (5 figs.), G. Nicco dis- cusses GrUnewald's freedom from the German grotesque spirit of the 1400's, typified by Bosch and his followers, and his relation to Holbein to whom Griinewald owed among other things his use of blue-black backgrounds with strong light and shadow on the foreground figures. But the chief importance of Griinewald was that he was the first of the Germans to use light to combine his figures with the space in which they moved. Between the earliest known work of GrUnewald- the Mocking of Christ, at Munich, 1503-and his masterpiece, the Isenheim Altarpiece, only five years intervened, but during that time the artist had changed from a painter of the 1400's to a cinquecentist. Lorenzo Monaco, Miniaturist.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 285-317 and 379-399 (36 figs.), A. M. CIARANFI deals with the codices decorated by Lorenzo Monaco and shows how each phase of his artistic development is represented in the miniatures. The earliest of these is a cardinal saint in an antiphonal in the Laurentian Library (Corale 5), dated 1394 and not previously attrib- uted to Lorenzo. Next come a David and a St. Romualdo in Corale 8, Laurentian Library, in which Ciaranfi discovered the date 1395. These two chorals, if the attribution to Lorenzo is cor- rect, are his earliest dated works and confirm the hypothesis that miniature painting was the ear- liest form of his artistic activity. Other codices discussed are: Corale 3, Laurentiana, dated 1409, containing a series of prophets by Lorenzo: H74 and Cod. E70, in the Bargello, the former dated by documentary and stylistic evidence 1412-13, the latter probably between 1420-1422. Further investigation may add still others to the already</page><page sequence="30">146 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY considerable number of miniatures from Lorenzo's hand. A Signed Work by Jacopo Bellini.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, p. 148 (fig.), A. VENTURI adds a fourth picture to the three known signed works of the elder Bellini-a St. Jerome in a private collection which bears the date, 1443. Besides revealing the stylistic traits in color and lighting character- istic of Jacopo, this picture embodies a foretaste of the lyric spirit which later is apparent in the work of Giambellino. Drawings by Benozzo.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 91-103 (7 figs.), B. BERENSON identifies a drawing in the Uffizi representing Totila at the Council of Perugia as the work of Benozzo not of Bonfigli to whom it has been heretofore at- tributed on the basis of his painting of the same subject at Perugia. The firm structural lines, especially evident in the architecture, are charac- teristic of Benozzo. A drawing of the Presenta- tion of the Virgin in the British Museum, formerly ascribed to Neri di Bicci, through its connection with a fresco of the same subject by Benozzo in the Chapel of the Visitation, at Santa Chiara, Castelfiorentino is given by Berenson to Benozzo. So also is a drawing, in Munich, representing the Expulsion of Joachim from the Temple connected with a fresco in the same chapel in Castelfioren- tino. These three drawings are the only known ones done in charcoal by Benozzo or by any other pupil of Fra Angelico. A Tintoretto Nativity.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, p. 498 (fig.), L. VENTURI publishes a nativity from the Lathrop Collection which, when cleaned, proved to be a magnificent, signed Tintoretto. It probably dates from about 1560. Some Florentine Quattrocento Pictures.-In a series of three articles in Dedalo, Anno XII, 1932, Fasc. VII, pp. 512-541, Fasc. IX, pp. 665-702, and Fasc. XI, pp. 819-853 (many figs.), B. BERENSON publishes a large number of "homeless" quattro- cento pictures which, through private sale or some accident, have disappeared from the places where they were at one time visible. The works here dealt with, though centering round the greatest names of the period, are chiefly by minor artists and those who, as Berenson says, have not yet reached their majority in the sense of being recognized in terms of monetary value. There are, however, among these pictures some of such merit as to add considerably to the artistic reputation of the artists concerned. There are two main groups of artists dealt with here: first, those centering around Masolino, Fra Filippo, Masaccio, and Fra Angelico, namely Andrea di Giusto, Domenico di Michelino, and Francesco di Antonio Banchi, with a sub-group formed about Paolo Uccello represented by the so-called Master of the Carrand Altarpiece. Of this group the most important pictures whose whereabouts are unknown are a Madonna by Masolino, part of a dismembered polyptych formerly in S. Maria Maggiore, Florence, dis- covered by Toesca at Novoli near Florence and unfortunately lost sight of immediately after- ward, and a Flagellation which, though worthy of the master, is probably by Andrea di Giusto. Two cassone panels of the Uccello school, interest- ing because of the strong Oriental influence in the decorative details especially the cufic inscriptions, have dropped out of sight, as have also one of the most charming and "filippesque" predella scenes of Fra Filippo and an Annunciation by him of somewhat inferior quality. The former of these two disappeared at the Aynard sale. The group dealt with in the second and third articles of the series consists of Pesellino and his followers: Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino, Zanobi Macchiavelli, and Giusto d'Andrea. No pictures heretofore attributed to Pesellino by Berenson are homeless, but several are here in- troduced and restored to Pesellino which were formerly attributed to Compagno di Pesellino whose artistic personality Berenson no longer recognizes as distinct from the master himself. A painting of the Madonna and Angels, recently acquired by Mr. Harold Platt as a work of little value, Berenson considers the most outstanding of Pesellino's works as well as one of the most beautiful quattrocento Florentine works. Of Pesellino's smaller paintings, none of the cassone panels is in circulation, but a fragment of a predella representing David dancing before the ark has disappeared; its three companion panels are still found, one at the Fogg Museum, the other two at Le Mans. A Pietd, formerly at Arundel Castle, probably painted by a follower of Giusto d'Andrea the so-called Master of the San Miniato Altarpiece, is fine enough to have been attributed both to Pollaiuolo (ANT. PALLAIOLI is written under the picture) and to the school of Castagno. The Nativity formerly at Castello, from which the Castello Master, a follower of the San Miiiniato Master, takes his name, is temporarily without a home, being deposited at the Uffizi for cleaning and restoration.</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 147 The group of artists following in the train of Fra Filippo and Pesellino would not be complete without Jacopo Sellaio, Benozzo and his second, Alunno di Benozzo; the latter was "discovered" and christened by Berenson, who considers this name preferable to that of "Maestro Esiguo," given to the same personality later by Longhi. Finally, the unattractive Neri di Bicci who, however, seems to have been director of the most active studio of his time. Of all these last mentioned painters there are various works which have changed hands in recent years. These articles on quadri senza casa are valuable for two reasons: not only do they reproduce and discuss many little-noted though often important works of minor masters, but they draw attention to change of ownership and location and some- times, doubtless, lead to the rediscovery of lost or temporarily mislaid pictures. Tullio Lombardo and Andrea Riccio.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, 1932, Fasc. XII, pp. 901-9924 (05 figs.), L. PLANISCIG commemorates the 400th anniversary of the death of the two last sculptors of the Venetian Renaissance: Tullio Lombardo and Andrea Riccio. Though they lived at the same time, near together (Venice and Padua respectively) and were subject to the same influences, their careers were different. Tullio was brought up in the stone-cutter's tradition; Andrea Riccio in the goldsmith's. Tullio worked almost exclusively in marble, Andrea in bronze. Both were influenced by Augustan-Roman antiques, Tullio all through his life, however, while with Andrea Riccio it was only in certain phases of his development. Tullio's best work is a series of remarkable marble busts of young men and women, some in relief and some in the round. Andrea's first period shows naturalistic tend- encies, as in the figure of a horseman in Victoria and Albert Museum, of which several replicas exist in other places. In the second phase he is dominated, like Tullio, by Augustan classicism; in his third stage he is still classical, but now it is bucolic nature that determines his conceptions: satyr and Pan figures and an unusual representa- tion of a female satyr in a naturalistic landscape setting. Whereas Tullio Lombardo created but one original in his sculptured figures, Andrea Riccio has many shop replicas from one design. The difference in their style may be summed up in the words static as describing Tullio, dynamic as characterizing Andrea Riccio. Some Madonnas in Private Collections.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 407-423 (6 figs.), L. VENTURI publishes the following attributions of pictures: a Madonna Enthroned in the Rosenfeld Collection, New York, and another fragment of a Madonna in the Blumenthal Collection, both assigned to Filippo Lippi; in the collection of Sir Joseph Duveen, a Madonna to Botticelli, a Ma- donna and Angel to Filippino Lippi, and a Madonna to Domenico Ghirlandajo; in the collec- tion of Edsel Ford, Detroit, a Madonna to Peru- gino. All are reproduced. Giotto and the Stigmatization.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 49-57 (7 figs.), F. J. MATHER uses the various treatments of the Stigmata theme by Giotto at different periods of his career as a basis for an outline of his artistic development. Beginning with the nineteenth fresco of the St. Francis series at Assisi he passes on to the predella picture in the Louvre and the newly discovered panel recently purchased by the Fogg Museum, discussing the latter at some length. The little-known fresco in the Chapter House of the Santo in Padua and the design for one of the formelle executed by Taddeo Gaddi for a sacristy door at Sta. Croce, lead up to the final version of the stigmata in the fresco over the entrance to the Bardi Chapel. Mather uses as a stylistic basis for dating these pictures the differ- ences in the Gothic features employed which echo the rapid change in Gothic architecture between 1297 and 1320. The Pupils of Lorenzo Di Credi.-In the Miinch. Jahrb., Bd. IX, 1932, Heft 2, pp. 95-161 (49 figs.), is a systematic attempt by B. DEGEN- HART to disentangle the genuine pictures by Credi from the mass of work by his pupils with which the master's later work has been hopelessly confused. The first individual follower of Credi to be distinguished is the Master of the Gdttingen Crucifixion, probably Gianjacopo di Castrocaro. The G6ttinger Crucifixion, in contrast to anything painted by Credi, is full of movement and spiritual liveliness; the colors also are not Credi's usual ones, especially the shades of violet. A group of drawings, in the Uffizi and elsewhere, is attributed to this master as well as a number of paintings among which are the St. Sebastian in Cambridge showing Leonardesque influence, and several Madonnas. Another pupil of Credi is Giovanni Antonio Sogliani whose early work, even though done doubtless under Credi's guidance, shows less of his influence than might be expected.</page><page sequence="32">148 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Instead, there is strong influence of Fra Barto- lommeo's coloring. Some other pupils of Credi show the influence of Ridolfo Ghirlandajo, and, through him, of Fra Bartolommeo also; foremost among these is Michele di Ridolfo, who studied first with Credi, then under Sogliani and finally worked with Ghirlandajo. This three-fold in- fluence is shown in the Coronation of the Virgin in the Earl of Roseberry's collection, London. To Antonio Ceraiuolo, called "Tommaso," and not to Credi as a late work are attributed four small panels, now in the Uffizi, probably parts of a predella to an altarpiece to the Virgin. Two other pupils of Credi whose work is distinguished from that of their master are Giovanni di Bene- detto Cianfanini and the so-called Master of Santo Spirito, Tommaso di Stefano. At the conclusion of the article Degenhart gives a chrono- logical list of Credi's paintings and drawings to- gether with references to reproductions of them. Some Drawings of Francesco Pesellino.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 357-377 (13 figs.), B. BERENSON disposes of the artistic personality of Compagno di Pesellino, whose supposed paintings he has already attributed to Pesellino. With even more certainty can his drawings be assigned to the master himself, for in them there is no mixture of hands to be accounted for as in paint- ing. The drawings which are dealt with here are chiefly those connected with the Trinity of Pesellino in the National Gallery, London. First the drawing in Berlin of the Father Eternal, formerly supposed by Berenson to be a sketch for Pesellino's Eternal in the Trinity, is now given to Lorenzo di Credi. Another drawing, in the Uffizi, formerly given to Pesellino, Berenson now thinks is a sketch made by Perugino from the St. Mamas in the Trinity. A sketch for St. Jerome in the Staedelinstitut, Frankfurt, is tentatively assigned to Pesellino. The only certain, original sketch for the Trinity is the drawing in the Uffizi of two saints, unquestionably by Pesellino, which is a study for Sts. Zeno and Mamas. Another drawing in the Uffizi, formerly attributed to Baldovinetti, has no connection with the Trinity figures but is given here as typical of Pesellino's late style. Sebastiano Serlio.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 183-199 (4 figs.), G. C. ARGAN analyzes the critical and artistic work of Serlio in an attempt to account for his lack of attainment and recognition among his contemporaries. There were two main phases of his career: the period in Venice when, preoccupied with the problem of space, he was trying to embody the Venetian pictorial represen- tation of space in terms of architectural principles; and the French period when, throwing all archi- tectonic and functional principles to the winds, he lost himself in a maze of abstract psychological categories which he expresses (in his Libro Extraordinario delle Porte) in such terms as solid, graceful, delicate, rough. The importance of Serlio and the value of his place lie in his person- ality rather than in his attainments. Niccold di Ser Sozzo Tegliacci.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 223-936 (5 figs.), C. BRANDI adds considerably to the artistic production of Niccol5 di Ser Sozzo Tegliacci, the Sienese miniaturist known until now by a single work, the signed and dated miniature of the Assumption. First of all, a polyptych in the gallery at Siena, when cleaned, showed a clear signature, associating Niccolk with Luca di Tomme in this work and giving the date, 1362. On the basis of this discovery, other works can be assigned to Niccol6: a polyptych with the Assumption and Saints in the Museo d'Arte Sacra at S. Gimignano, a Madonna in the Magaz- zini degli Uffizi, and a triptych of the Madonna Enthroned with Saints and Angels in the Societh di Pie Disposizioni at Siena. Niccol6 di Ser Sozzo, besides being himself an excellent painter and miniaturist, was of prime importance in establishing the Sienese school of the late four- teenth century. El Greco's Italian Period.-In Art Studies, viii, 1, 1930, pp. 61-88 (34 figs.), E. K. WATER- HOUSE deals with the early life of El Greco as far as it is known from the few records available. El Greco's artistic work of this early period Waterhouse divides into two parts: in Venice, before going to Rome, and in Rome. In each case he discusses the influences which affected the development of the young Greco. The author has also compiled a catalogue of pictures of the Italian period, with their approximate dates and descriptive and historical data about them. There are plates for study with excellent enlarged details of certain pictures such as, for instance, those of the Immaculate Conception at Chicago which the author uses to show El Greco's debt to Correggio. Leonardo Da Vinci, Sculptor.-In Art Studies, viii, 92, 1931, pp. 289-300 (13 figs.), R. S. STITES raises the question of the importance of Leo- nardo's sculpture through its influence on his contemporaries, as a means of bridging the gap in</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 149 the development of sculpture between Verrocchio- Pollaiuolo and Rusticci-Lombardi. The difficulty is to identify work by Leonardo in sculpture as in painting, and especially to disentangle it from that of Verrocchio, a problem which Stites tries to solve by means of comparisons based on the vari- ous figures which he has selected. The Influence of Titian and of Spain on the Later Landscapes of Rubens.-In the Miinch. Jahrb., Bd. viii, 1931, Heft 4, pp. 281-291 (7 figs.), E. KIESER points out some examples of Titian's influence on Rubens. The first of these is the Landscape with Rainbow in Petersburg which shows clearly dependence on an engraving by an unknown artist after Titian. In another landscape by Rubens (copied by Bolswert) a farm building appears which is almost identical with one in a copy of a Titian landscape. The Holy Family with Saints in Madrid, whether following any particular picture by Titian or not, shows his influence and that of the Venetian Renaissance. An example of Rubens' southern mountain land- scape type with the "grand-sad" conception and mythological subject, is the Landscape with Odysseus and Nausicaa in the Pitti, Florence, which shows the effects of his journey to Spain. Two other more important examples of the same type are a landscape, formerly in the Johnson Collection, and another, now lost, known only in a copy by Lucas v. Uden in Munich. The principal signs of this southern influence are a feeling of breadth, a soft clearness in the atmos- phere and a gradual transition into the distance together with a structurally-developed landscape -all characteristics potentially present in the Odyssey landscape and raised to greater idealism and monumentality through Rubens' contact with Spain. The influence of Titian appears first in the early phase of the late period, the southern influence in the middle phase, while in the last phase of all (exemplified by the Landscape with Sunset in London) reappear earlier elements among which are echoes of Titian, but no longer definite southern influence. Corot-Classicist or Impressionist? Corot has long been given by French critics a place midway between classicism and modern impressionism, on the ground that some of his works belong to each of these movements. In L'Arte, xxxiv, 1931, pp. 398-412 (6 figs.), M. B. PANCIERA examines this ambiguous position in order to determine what Corot really was-a continuer of an old tradition or an innovator. The solution of the riddle lies, according to Panciera, in the two entirely differ- ent sorts of work done by Corot: the academic pieces in which he made conscious efforts to follow classical models, and the spontaneous, lyrical pictures in which he simply and directly followed nature. ITALY A Polyptych by Lorenzo Veneziano.-In L' Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 400-403 (1 fig.), E. VAVALX' reconstructs a polyptych of which the center is the Delivery of the Keys to St. Peter in the Museo Correr at Venice, the wings are four panels with saints in Berlin, and the predella, five scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul, also in Berlin. The whole is here given to Lorenzo Veneziano, though the central panel and the predella were formerly attributed by Vavala to Giovanni da Bologna. The Earliest Fresco of Fra Filippo.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, 1932, Fasc. VIII, pp. 585-593 (4 figs.), A. DE WITT calls attention to what remains of a ruined fresco in the cloister of the Carmine Church in Florence, recorded by Vasari as the work of Fra Filippo Lippi. The subject is the confirmation of the order of the Carmelite Friars by the Pope; the fresco is described by Vasari as being near the Sagra painted by Ma- saccio. The foundation painting is of terra verde, but colors are used combining with the ground in soft tones of red, yellow, and gray. The part of the fresco which is least damaged represents a charming, peaceful landscape, in the background hills and trees, in the foreground a group of monks, among them a novice kneeling which suggests the prototype of the kneeling angel of later Annuncia- tions. The fresco is particularly important as representing the earliest phase of Lippi's style before he was possessed with the desire for mass and solidity of form under the influence of Masaccio's Brancacci frescoes. This fresco of the Conferma was painted probably between 1427 and 1430; after this first proof of his masterful skill, Fra Filippo is registered as "painter" in the account books of his monastery. An Early Madonna of Jacopo Sansovino.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, 1932, Fasc. IX, pp. 702-707 (2 figs.), F. RossI attributes to Jacopo Sansovino a Madonna belonging to Carlo Gamba, formerly at Settimello, now at Florence. The relief used to be called a Sienese work of the general style of Jacopo della Quercia-an attribution which Schubring discarded calling it Florentine and not</page><page sequence="34">150 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Sienese. By comparing it with other Madonnas by Jacopo Sansovino, notably a very similar one at Pone Casale, Villa Doria Dalle Rose, there seem to be marked stylistic similarities as, for instance, in the type of face and features of the Madonna, which are definitely characteristic of Jacopo. The relief shows strong Donatellesque influence and also a suggestion of Michelangelo; it was probably carved between about 1502 and 1506 when Jacopo as a very young man was working in the studio of Andrea Sansovino at Florence. An Early Work of Tiepolo.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, p. 476 (fig.), A. VENTURI publishes a Holy Family with an adoring Bishop, in the Ranieri Collection at Milan. The vibrant use of color is characteristic of Tiepolo, and especially the combination of rose and gray in the garments of the Virgin indicates an early work. A Portrait by Paolo Veronese.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932., p. 404 (fig.), A. VENTURI publishes as one of the finest and most important pictures of Veronese, a portrait of a woman executed for the noble family of Cuccina. The picture is now in a private collection in Milan. An Angel by Desiderio Da Settignano.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 153-160 (5 figs.), L. BECHERUCCI restores to Desiderio in part a monument at one time attributed wholly to him but later given to Bernardo Rossellino. The monument is the Tomb of Beata Villana in S. Maria Novella recorded as worked on by Bernardo and his companions. Becherucci differentiates the styles, especially in the two angels, and recognizes in the one on the right the exuberant spirit of the young Desiderio with the delicate, elusive smile characteristic of his figures. Deside- rio may have been engaged on this work about the middle of the fifteenth century. Sculpture in the Camposanto at Pisa.-Hidden away in the depository of the Camposanto are a number of statues and fragments almost inacces- sible to the public, some of which M. MARANGONI in L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 257-282 (14 figs.), attributes not to Giovanni Pisano as was formerly done, but to his pupil, Tino di Camaino. Most important among these are two additional fragments of the baptismal font, which confirm its attribution to Tino. Two seated Madonnas, one probably a replica, by Tino are there and two figures of prophets, one, a very fine work worthy of Giovanni Pisano, probably also by Tino, the other by another pupil of Giovanni. Two statues of angels, one probably by Tino, another by a pupil of his, while a third may be by a follower of Nino Pisano, are among the treasures of the depository. Marangoni regrets that the Campo- santo sculpture is so poorly cared for both in the dusty depository and in the open cloister, and suggests that it might better be collected in the Museo Civico. Baroque Ivories in the Museo Cristiano.-In Art Studies, viii, 2, 1931, pp. 35-45 (13 figs.), D. D. EGBERT distinguishes two groups of late sixteenth and early seventeenth century ivory statuettes, one, which he discusses as Group A, being of Spanish-Portuguese workmanship, the other, Group B, originating probably in Goa and being of eastern workmanship under strong Spanish or Portuguese influence. Though both groups are made from Indian ivory and, though the general iconography in both cases is western, there are certain stylistic differences between them, notably a strong tendency in the provincial work to exaggerate all the Spanish-Portuguese char- acteristics. GERMANY Some Newly Acquired Drawings in Berlin.- In Berliner Museen, lii, 1931, Heft 6, pp. 108-112 (5 figs.), J. ROSENBERG notes the following ac- quisitions of the Kupferstichkabinett: A "Little Master" pen drawing of the Sorrowing Hagar, probably by Barthel Beham; an early drawing by Rubens of a standing nude female figure which shows suggestions of Diirer, but in pose and in details such as the arrangement of the hair is very close to a bronze Venus by Konrad Meit. As the latter was undoubtedly influenced by Diirer's drawings, the suggestion of Diirer in the Rubens is accounted for. A third acquisition is a large pen drawing of the Entombment by Rembrandt. A landscape by Ruisdael from the Hermitage collection and a Bacchanale by Gabriel de Saint Aubin complete the list of which all but the Rembrandt are reproduced in the article. Pietro Francavilla.-In Berliner Museen, liii, 1932, Heft 2, pp. 23-26 (5 figs.), E. F. BANGE points out the importance of the acquisition by the Berlin Museum of a series of four bronze placques with scenes of the Passion by Pietro Francavilla. The reliefs were planned by Gio- vanni da Bologna but executed by his Netherland- ish pupil in 1588, and they are the first certain works by Francavilla to be placed in this museum. Oddly enough, just after the reliefs were pur-</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1932 151 chased, a bronze statuette of the Virgin was also acquired by the same museum which, because of its stylistic closeness to the relief placques and to the allegorical statue of the Holy Life in SS. Annun- ziata, Florence, must be assigned to Francavilla. On the basis of stylistic resemblances, also, the "Vogelsteller " in Berlin, formerly thought to be by Giovanni da Bologna, may be tentatively at- tributed to Francavilla. A Lost Fragment of an Early Fifteenth Century Westphalian Altarpiece.-In Berliner Museen, liii, 1932, Heft 1, pp. 9-12 (3 figs.), R. FRITZ iden- tifies a small wood panel painted with the Presen- tation of Christ in the Temple, recently given to the Deutsches Museum, in Berlin, as a section of one of the two lost wings of the Bielefelder altar- piece. From sketches in Minden of thirteen of the pictures from these panels and from compari- son with the scenes of similar altarpieces, Fritz reconstructs the wings of the altarpiece. The date, according to its style, must be about the third decade of the fifteenth century. The altar- piece shows unmistakable signs of IWestphalian workmanship; possibly the hand of a pupil of Conrad von Soest may be seen in the central panel, while other scenes on the same altarpiece may be by his shop assistants or followers. HUNGARY Italian Art at Strigonia.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, Fase. XII 1932, pp. 933-960 (29 figs.), E. B. TOESCA publishes some of the more important works of Italian art in the Hungarian city of Esztergom, the former Italian Strigonia. There are, it seems, good examples, many of them almost completely unknown, of the various Italian schools of painting in the Museo Cristiano as well as many valuable and interesting objects in the treasure of the cathedral. FRANCE Two Unedited Paintings of Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti.-In Dedalo, Anno XII, Fasc. IX, 1932, pp. 659-665 (1 pl. and 3 figs.), A. COLASANTI attributes to Simone Martini a small panel with St. John the Evangelist, in a private collection in Paris. On the basis of comparison with the frescoes in the Chapel of St. Martin at S. Francesco, Assisi, Colasanti suggests the hy- pothesis that this panel is a fragment of a polyp- tych or crucifix ordered for the Chapel at the same time and so dating between 1318 and 1320. In another panel in a private collection at Rome, representing a saint, probably St. James the Apostle, Colasanti recognizes the wholly different style of Pietro Lorenzetti of about the year 1330. A Madonna of Filippo Lippi.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 104-109 (2 figs.), P. TOESCA attributes to Fra Filippo one more typically charming Madonna, formerly in a private collection near Florence, now at Nice. Toesca recognizes char- acteristic details of the artist's style and places it between the Tarquinia Madonna Enthroned and the Uffizi Coronation, that is, in the period when the influence of Masaccio on Fra Filippo was most apparent. SPAIN Rodrigo de Osona.-In Archivo Espaihol de Arte y Arqueologia, num. xxiii, 7, 1932, pp. 101- 147 (42 figs.), E. ToRMo Y MoNzo presents in a detailed study the sum total of documentary evi- dence thus far come to light concerning the paint- ers Rodrigo de Osona, father and son, whose chief importance is their influence, which was, appar- ently, considerable in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. Little enough is known about either of them: the father was a painter in Valen- cia probably between 1476 and 1482; the son and his followers were the most popular (or, at least, the most highly paid) painters in Valencia in 1513. One picture, a Crucifixion in St. Nicholas, Valencia, is signed and documented as a work by the elder Rodrigo de Osona, and was painted in 1476. An Adoration of the Magi in the National Gallery is signed as by the "son of Master Rod- rigo." On the basis of a careful style analysis, various other pictures are here attributed by the author. ENGLAND A Titian Portrait.-In L'Arte, xxxv, 1932, pp. 481-497 (6 figs.), L. VENTURI attributes to Titian a portrait of a man formerly in the Earl of Durham's Collection at Lambton Castle. The picture has been generally assigned to Sebastiano del Piombo. Other attributions to Titian given in the same article are a portrait of Daniele Bar- baro in the National Gallery of Ottawa, a Venus, Ceres and Cupid in the Wildenstein Collection, and a St. Jerome, in the Boehler-Steinmeyer Col- lection, New York.</page><page sequence="36">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS In the early days of the past autumn the Acro- polis of Athens welcomed back the ghost of a former inhabitant, for a figure of Theseus (Dionysos?) once more reclines in the east pediment of the Parthenon. It is a very fine copy in cement of the marble original and is the gift of the British Museum. When the idea of placing cement copies in the pediments of the Parthenon was first suggested, a great storm of protest was aroused, but the Theseus had been back in the pediment for some days before the general public or the journalists noticed him. An Open Meeting was held at the German Archaeological Institute on December 9, 1932, as a Winckelmann Memorial. Reports were given by Professor Orlandos of the Ecole Polytechnique on his excavations at Alipheira in Arcadia, one of the towns captured by Philip V and his Mace- donians in 219 B.c.; and by Dr. Welter on his recent excavations of the Sanctuary of Asklepios at Troizen some 15 miles south of Epidauros. The site of Alipheira had been identified by Leake, Ross, and Curtius as the high isolated mountain on the southern side of the valley of the Alpheios about midway between Olympia and Phigaleia but nearer the modern village of Zacha. Frazer also had visited the site and traced many of the fortification walls on the summit of the Acropolis and on the lower slopes of the mountain, but it had never been excavated until Professor Orlandos began his work in the summer of 1932. The chief results of his campaign were the clearing of the foundations of two temples and the uncovering of two Hellenistic mausolea. The first temple was on the acropolis and Mr. Orlandos has identified it as the Temple of Athena described by Pausanias (VIII, 26, 4). This was a peripteral temple, 29 m. x 10.65 m., and had only one step above the euthynteria like the Temple of Hera at Olympia and the Hekatompedon. The columns were of conglomerate, six on the ends and fifteen on the long sides. Several drums of these columns were found and one capital showing a rather flattened curve to the echinus. No pieces of the frieze were recovered but a quantity of roof-tiles made of coarse-grained Island marble: flat tiles, cover-tiles, and end-tiles with a painted decoration. In front of the tem- ple there were found in situ five bases for dedica- tory statues. It is quite obvious from the dimensions of this temple that the colossal bronze statue mentioned by Polybios (IV, 78) could not have stood within the naos but like the Promachos on the Acropolis must have been outside. Small finds from the neighborhood of the Athena temple consisted of part of a lebes of the first half of the fifth century B.c. and a head of Medusa of the fourth century B.c., but more important still was the finding of an inscription which mentions the Alipheiraeans four times, thus giving epigraphical confirmation of the identification of the site of Alipheira. The inscription deals with the settlement of the boundary between the territory of the Aliphei- raeans and the Lepreans. The second temple, which belonged to the Hellenistic period, was near the western end of the acropolis and is probably the Temple of Asklepios mentioned by Pausanias. Within the temple were found the statue base and the "holy table." On the evidence of coins found in the excavation, this temple may be dated before the second century B.C. In the third region investigated by Mr. Or- landos two Hellenistic mausolea were uncovered. One is hewn in the rock and has four rectangular compartments with dividing walls ending in four-sided pilasters supporting the horizontal epistyle with a pediment above. This type of tomb is not met with elsewhere in Greece. On the architrave are inscribed the names of the dead and upon the central pilaster a fine epigram of the third century B.c. The second funeral monument is of Attic type, consisting of a base in the shape of the letter Pi (II), upon which is a naiskos with the names of the dead, apparently husband and wife. The excellence of the work- manship and the forms of the letters assign the monument to about 300 B.c. Another find of Professor Orlandos was a bronze statuette of a nude bearded male figure, standing with the weight on both feet in a position similar to that of the so-called Pythagoras in the Museum of Syracuse. To judge by the face, the Alipheira statuette probably represents a Satyr, but it is an incomplete example damaged in the cast- ing, for the tail is missing as well as the sup- ports for the feet. Dr. Orlandos considers that 159</page><page sequence="37">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 153 this statuette belongs to the earliest classical times.' Although Troizen had been an important town in antiquity, closely allied to Athens at one time but later under the hegemony of Sparta, and well-known because of its Sanctuary of Asklepios and through its connection with the tragic story of Hippolytos and Phaedra, its ruins had never been scientifically explored except for some trial trenches dug by the French School in 1893. The modern village of Damalas is built above the ruins of the ancient city, but it was the region of the sanctuaries to the west of the city which interested Dr. Welter more particularly since the description in Pausanias (II, 31 and 32) is not very clear and the trial trenches of the French had revealed a puzzling building, apparently a Banquet Hall. The funds for the new excavation were provided by the Catalan Society of Barce- lona and work was begun on the great square building, 31 m. x 31 m., which stands on a plateau 400 m. long rising about 50 m. above the plain. This consisted of a large hall 31 m. in length and 10 m. wide with two doors opening on the north side leading to a court with a peristyle. Smaller rooms opened off this court on the other three sides; those on the east and west were found in a fairly good state of preservation while those on the north were ruinous. Down the centre of the Hall foundations for three columns were still in situ, while along the walls and projecting at right angles towards the columns were the bases for couches numbered alphabetically and having oblong marble tables beside them. The couches would have been 1.80 m. long by 0.82 m. wide and they numbered 62 in all, while the tables are 0.80 m. long. The rooms to the west and east of the court measure 4.50 m. x 6 m. and have the same arrangement of couches. The floors of the Hall and the smaller rooms were made of pebble mosaic which could easily be washed, since arrangements were provided for carrying off the water through channels leading under the door- sills to the gutters which bounded the open court. The lower part of the walls was con- structed of great slabs of blue marble while the upper part had obviously been built of unbaked brick. The reconstruction of the building is quite certain even up to the roof, as all types of the roof tiles were recovered. The building must have had an external appearance very similar to 1 For this Report I am indebted to the kind- ness of Professor Orlandos. that of a basilica with cloisters attached, as the great hall was higher and had a pitched roof while the rooms around the court had their roofs sloping inward. From the pottery found in the various parts of the edifice, Dr. Welter has dated the building to the Hellenistic period be- tween 250 and 200 B.c. This type of architec- tural complex is interesting as it reappears in the second century A.D. in the synagogues of Galilee and has always been supposed to have originated in Alexandria. The purpose of the building in Troizen was undoubtedly for the use of patients who came to the Sanctuary to be cured and who slept here to await the visit of the god and the subsequent cure. The peculiar channels sunk in the floor between the couches and covered by tiles were probably used for burning herbs, the fumes of which were calculated to inspire the dreams of the patients and to help effect their cure. The services of the God of Healing might well have been invoked by the excavators, as the whole region in modern times is malarial and their diet consisted largely of quinine. The work at Eleusis, directed by Dr. K. Kourouniotis and Dr. George E. Mylonas of the University of Illinois, was continued during the spring and summer of 1932, the efforts of the ex- cavators being concentrated this year on the Telesterion. All the fill has been removed, and the living rock has been uncovered everywhere. The foundations of the classical buildings and of their columns are now cleared and ready for study. Under the polygonal Telesterion the remains of the round building noted by Philios were laid bare; they appear to have formed part of a sanctu- ary that was in use during the tenth and ninth centuries B.c. The retaining wall of the terrace on which this temple was built was uncovered, and the entrance to the sanctuary, with three steps, is still preserved in situ. This round build- ing was partly based on a Late Helladic III wall which was found to be a peribolos wall enclosing a megaron-shaped building, the foundations of which were uncovered to their full length. The excavators believe that this building and the later additions are an earlier sanctuary that was built during the fifteenth century. It remained in use until the end of the Mycenaean Age, as is indicated by the pottery recovered. The terrace wall of the polygonal sanctuary was also cleared in its whole extent, and outside it, near the en- trance to the sanctuary, a great pyre was found,</page><page sequence="38">154 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY rich in terracottas, Corinthian and black-figured vases, lamps and other small offerings. The clearing of the southern court brought to light the remains of the Periclean entrance to the sanctuary, the entrance from the sea, guarded by a square tower; part of the latter is preserved, and the bedding, cut in the rock, for its lowest course of stone permits its complete plan to be recovered. Outside the Telesterion extensive soundings were made on the top of the hill behind the sanctuary. Most of the trenches dug revealed nothing of importance, but at the extreme eastern edge of the hill and to the west of the steeple of the modern Chapel of Panaghitsa the remains of what appears to be a Late Helladic III palace came to light. This seems to support the view that the large building discovered beneath the polygonal Telesterion was not the residence of the ruler. The excavators hope to uncover the whole of the palace in the next campaign. To the west of the Eleusinian Acropolis, and between it and the hill crowned by the Venetian tower lies a plateau which had not been previously tested. Digging on its southern slope revealed a retaining wall of great length, carefully built of large Eleusinian blocks probably in the Hel- lenistic period. Along the front of this wall a broad roadway was laid bare together with many houses built in blocks below it. The space enclosed by the retaining wall was tested, but the complete excavation of this area was postponed to another campaign. It may contain another sanctuary like the one known as the Sacred House, excavated some years ago by Dr. Kou- rouniotis. The chief importance of this season's work, however, is believed by the excavators to be its contribution to our knowledge of the Telesterion itself; for it has now become evident that there was a sanctuary on the spot during the Late Helladic III period and that the mysteries as well as the temples go back to a date consider- ably beyond that assigned to their origin by the late Professor Noack. The British School at Athens carried on two campaigns in the spring and summer of 1932, the first under the leadership of the Director, Mr. Payne at Perachora and the second under Mr. Heurtley, the Assistant-Director, in Ithaca. The campaign at Perachora was the third under- taken at this site by the School and its principal objective was the clearing of the area in which great quantities of small objects, dedicated to Hera, had been found in the two previous years.1 This work uncovered the foundations of a very early temple of Hera and a great part of the walls which surrounded the Sanctuary. The precinct appears to have been rectangular, the east wall, the whole length of which can be traced, measures 25 m.; of the north wall 13 m. are preserved, but the deposit of votive offerings suggests that on this side and on the south, where the sanctuary is bounded by rocks, the length was at least 30 m. The foundations of the temple lie in the south- eastern part of this area. The building, of which two courses of rough foundations are preserved, faces north and south and measures 9.5 m. x 5.5 m. Almost exactly in the centre of the build- ing is a rectangular sacrificial pit (1.4 m. x 1.05 m) bordered with stone. This was entirely filled with grey ash. The presence of an altar or sacrificial pit inside the building is a rather unusual feature which is paralleled by early temples in Crete and elsewhere. The temple itself was evidently kept clear of offerings, for it contained remarkably few sherds. In the immediate neighborhood, however, there was a particularly rich deposit of pottery, ivories and scarabs, and from the rela- tion of its lowest strata to the foundations of the temple it was evident that the building in its present form goes back at least to the early seventh century. This conclusion agrees with the evidence derived from a series of painted roof-tiles which are undoubtedly of seventh- century date. The best example is almost complete: it consists of a very large flat tile made in one piece with two cover-tiles, probably unique. On the front of the cover-tiles are painted volutes and palmettes and on the flat tile a black and red cable. The shape and patterns indicate a date considerably before the end of the seventh century. The votive deposits near the temple are fairly well stratified in a chronological series but in the western part of the temenos later buildings had disturbed this stratification. The bronzes found in 1932 include, beside a great number of other small objects, several geometric horses (P1. XXV, Fig. 1), a lion and a gorgon (P1. XXV, Fig. 2) like those found in 1930, another lion, a cow and, at some little distance west of the Heraeum, a dove of fine Proto-Corinthian style (P1. XXV, II am much indebted to Mr. Payne, Director of the British School, for his kindness in furnish- ing me with the photographs and information contained in this report.</page><page sequence="39">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 155 Fig. 3), dating from about the middle of the seventh century. There were also a great num- ber of ivories: as against some twenty circular seals with engraved designs found in the two previous years, over sixty were found this year, as well as a large collection of "spectacle-fibulae," ivory and amber fibulae and pendants, seven figures of couchant animals more or less closely resembling those from Sparta, and a bone figure of the goddess which has some Laconian parallels. The most remarkable ivory yet found, and one of the finest early ivories ever found in Greece, is a Sphinx nearly three inches high, carved in the round, an early Daedalic work of the first quarter of the seventh century (P1. XXV, Fig. 4). The mass of pottery requires further detailed study, but two inscribed fragments, one of the seventh century, one of the late sixth or fifth, must be mentioned, since they record dedications to Hera Limenia (Hera of the Harbor); the same dedica- tion was found on a bronze bull discovered last year. Thus in the only three instances in which the goddess has an epithet she is described by a name other than that which is recorded by the literary sources (Hera Akraia), and further, by one which does not at first sight commend itself, since the place possesses no good harbor. Im- ported objects were again extraordinarily plenti- ful: some 500 faience scarabs, beads and small figures were found, bringing the total for three years to over 750-a number considerably larger than that from all the sites of mainland Greece put together, and all the more surprising since only one scarab has been found in Corinth. Some of these scarabs are said certainly to be Egyptian, others, apparently, may be Cypriote or Syrian. A large bronze earring plated with gold is undoubtedly Cypriote. The imported pottery found in this campaign includes wares from Attica, Laconia, Argolis (terracottas and many pieces of a very large geometric krater), Thera, Rhodes, Naukratis, some Etruscan buc- chero and a small votive altar of West-Greek fabric. An interesting illustration of the Argive connection is given by a clay plaque of the early seventh century which was made in the same mould as a plaque found in the excavations of the Argive Heraeum. The most surprising of the imports is, however, a bronze belt-clasp in the shape of a lion, schematically rendered, perhaps Scythian or Cappadocian in origin. A carnelian scarab, probably imported from some East-Greek city, shows an engraved design of Herakles about to shoot an arrow. This is one of the finest existing gems of the late sixth century. After the clearing of the Heraeum area some trenches were cut in the steep slope just above the seashore, due east of the harbor temple. These led to the finding of a Doric stoa built of limestone with pebble mosaic floor. This is the best pre- served of the buildings so far found at the He- raeum (P1. XXVI, Fig. 5). It is L-shaped measuring a little over 17 m. along each of the back walls, with a facade of six Doric columns on each arm. One column drum was still standing in position, and one other was found near the stylobate; the rest had disappeared. The back wall is well preserved at the west end and at the central angle. Almost the whole of the entabla- ture can be reconstructed with certainty from fragments found within the stoa. On the fine marble stucco with which the building was faced there are many clear traces of red, blue, and black patterns, which makes it possible to restore the color-scheme of the whole. A great many pieces of architectural terracottas were found: these are nearly all decorated with palmettes in the style of the late fifth or early fourth century, a date to which several other features of the building point. A number of fragments of Ionic half-columns were found inside the building which may have stood against the back wall at some height above the ground. The capitals of these half-columns bear an obvious resemblance to those from the temple at Bassae. A few yards west of the stoa, and on the same stretch of pebble pavement, there is a large base or altar consisting of a frieze of triglyphs and metopes, standing on a low plinth-a scheme which recalls other monuments in Corinth and its colonies. On either side of this was an Ionic column; the base of one of these columns is preserved, and, like the capitals of the half- columns found in the stoa, shows a strong re- semblance to the type used at Bassae. The harbor temple (P1. XXVI, Fig. 6) which may perhaps be a temple of Artemis was further studied and the statue base in the central com- partment of the west end was raised. Beneath it were found five small silver coins of archaic type. Further progress was made with the excavation of the Agora, and some fine pieces of a painted terracotta cornice dating from the late fifth century were found; also a very fine terra- cotta head of a woman two inches high of late fourth or early third century style. In a field</page><page sequence="40">156 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY behind and above the agora an exploratory trench was dug in which part of a very early seventh-century relief plaque was found. This area must be further explored. Trial trenches were also dug on the two acropolis rocks, at Hagios Nikolaos and near the lighthouse, where there are ancient fortification walls. Near the light- house, a fairly well-preserved house with walls dating partly from the archaic, and partly from the Hellenistic, period was found. The architect also surveyed the whole area from Lake Escha- tively identified last year as those of a burnt house, proved to be a series of small cairns heaped over ashes which rested on a floor of potsherds. This custom of raising cairns over human ashes was common in Greece in the Heroic Age and, according to Homer, both Greeks and Trojans disposed of their dead in this way. Since the pottery found at Aetos belongs to the sub-My- cenaean and Proto-Geometric periods these cairns must be dated to the tenth and ninth centuries B.c.

The most interesting of these consists of three vertical shafts cut in the rock, and approached from one side by a stairway which runs underground to a depth of over ninety feet. Under the leadership of Mr. Heurtley the Brit- ish expedition promoted by Sir Rennell Rodd, completed its third exploratory campaign in Ithaca on the 15th of October.' At Aetos, in the south half of the island, they continued the exploration of the sub-Mycenaean and Proto- Corinthian deposits begun last year. In the sub- Mycenaean area the remains which were tenta- 1I am much indebted to Professor Heurtley, Assistant Director of the British School in Athens, who was good enough to give me this report. cairns were two Mycenaean spindle-whorls and a bronze pin. The Proto-Corinthian deposit is separated from the sub-Mycenaean by a terrace wall, and there is some evidence that the numer- ous Proto-Corinthian vases and other objects found, were placed, originally, above the cairns, but that later, owing to successive collapses of the terrace wall they were scattered down the slope gradually forming two strata which could be distinguished. From the upper stratum over 170 vases have been put together and many more await completion (Figs. 1-3). These vases illus- trate the development of the Proto-Corinthian style from its earliest to its latest phase, and there is much local material new in form and decora- tion.

At the small harbor which lies below the sanctuary the clearing of the big wall which runs at right angles to the shore was continued. The western face is ruinous, but the eastern is well preserved and is a fine example of polygonal masonry. On the evidence of the pottery found in association with it, it was built in the fourth or third century B.C., and destroyed in the first or second century A.D., perhaps by the same earthquake which caused the collapse of the cave at Polis. The style of construction is not in- consistent with this dating. In a small cave at the west end of the harbor, stratified traces of Graeco-Roman occupation were found. The floor of the cave, like that of Polis, lies about one and a half metres below the level of the sea.

In the cave at Polis, by the use of a powerful pump, Miss Benton and her assistant were able to clear a fairly large area down to the rock. The stratified layers revealed that the cave had been used from pre-Mycenaean times to the first or second century A.D., when the collapse of the roof took place. To the Mycenaean period belongs a stone pavement, and to a later period belongs a terrace wall which was reached from below by steps. Beside the steps stood four bronze tripods, of one of which all the essential parts have been recovered.

HANDLE FROM A BRONZE TRIPOD Mycenaean and sub-Mycenaean vases found last year, many twelfth-century Mycenaean sherds and some pre-Mycenaean were also found. in Crete. These tombs were near the village of Lakythra in the southwest corner of the island. The smaller of the two tombs, like a miniature beehive in shape, was intact and produced more than sixty vases, all small, and the usual comple- ment of other small finds, chief among them being an amulet and an engraved gem of rock-crystal with a linear design. Both the dimensions of this tomb and the type of funerary equipment would indicate that it had belonged to a rather poor family. The second tomb, however, was very large and had niches cut in its circumfer- ence so that it was almost trefoil in shape. The roof had fallen in and the tomb had been plun- dered. Eleven burial pits were found in the floor of the chamber and a twelfth in the dromos just outside the door, but the cover-slabs of all these except the one in the dromos, had been pushed aside by the plunderers and the tomb left in great disorder. In the dromos pit two skeletons were found undisturbed, but no offerings had been interred with them. From the debris within the chamber it has been possible to reconstruct more than one hundred vases, several of which are fine examples of Late Mycenaean ware: the series of large and small kraters is noteworthy, as is the</page><page sequence="43">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 159 abundance of high-footed kylikes and jugs. There is also a very fine specimen of an amphora 0.40 m. high. The plunderers in their haste had dropped or overlooked a little of the jewelry and the excavators recovered a series of glass rosettes, bits of gold leaf, a dozen large and small gold beads, and one in the shape of a papy- rus flower, and another with granulated decora- tion. The most interesting of the small finds was a thin gold chain 0.17 m. long, of very delicate workmanship. Mr. Marinatos considers that his discoveries have proved that in Cephalonia, and especially in the region of Livatho (extending from St. George to the south end of the island), a vigorous civilization flourished towards the end of the Mycenaean epoch and that this was the centre of the realm of the "great-souled Cephalo- nians" mentioned in the Odyssey. The Ephor for Achaia and Elis, Mr. Nerant- zoulis, has recently identified a site about 800 m. up on the western slope of Erymanthos as that of ancient Tritia, one of the cities of the Achaian League. He places it near the village of Hagia Marina in the angle where Achaia, Elis and Ar- cadia meet and not at Kastritza where Frazer and earlier topographers had supposed it to be. No conclusive evidence for their choice had ever been produced, and the distance from Kastritza to Pharai did not correspond to that given by Pausanias for the distance between Tritia and Pharai. Trial excavations were carried out on the new site and the extent of the city was determined as about 400 stremmata. Since the layer of soil over the ruins was not very deep the walls of the city and the cemetery were very soon uncovered. Foundations and columns of public buildings, preserved to a considerable height were found in situ. Funerary inscriptions, bronze coins of the Achaean League and a quantity of Hellenistic pottery were also recovered. Three buildings were excavated, one a temple, either that of Athena or else the Temple of the Great Gods mentioned by Pausanias (VII, 22, 9). The second building does not have the ground plan of a temple, but it is well built, and from the frag- ments of plaster wall paintings would appear to have been elaborately decorated. On the floor were found many coins of Sicyon and Thebes. Not very far from this building there was uncov- ered the end of a long stylobate which runs from east to west and has a length of ca. 35 m. This is, in the opinion of the excavator, the stoa of the Agora of Tritia. The cemetery of the city was also discovered and fourteen funeral inscriptions belonging to it. A large inscription containing the laws of the Achaean League was also found. The site needs further exploration next spring.
