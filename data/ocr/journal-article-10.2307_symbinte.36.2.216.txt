<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Editors’ Choice Learning from Experience: Recollections of Working with Howard S. Becker* Clinton R. Sanders University of Connecticut (Emeritus) Howard S. Becker is, and has been, a major figure in contemporary sociology, especially within the symbolic interactionist perspective. This discussion describes my initial encounter with Howie in the mid- 1960s and moves to identify the substantive and methodological areas in which he has had major impact. I then briefly outline various ways in which the foci of my own work have been shaped by Becker’s instruction and example. Keywords: deviant behavior/labeling theory, qualitative methods, soci- ology of art Where we find ourselves in a particular location and at a particular time is a con- sequence of the interesting (happy, horrifying) combination of choice, compulsion, and chance. Having lived in the Chicago area for a few years as an undergraduate,1 had some experience with the city’s active folk music scene, and wanting to be near my friends again, I applied for graduate school at a number of institutions in the metropolitan area. So, in 1966, after being rejected by the University of Chicago’s department (my first choice), I was accepted into and entered (along with some 60 other members of my cohort) the graduate program in sociology at Northwestern University (NU). I had read Howard Becker’s2 book The Outsiders (1963) as an undergraduate because someone told me it was about the use of a substance in which I was developing a personal interest, but was only vaguely aware that he was a faculty member at NU. The NU department was quite a place during this time with luminaries like Bernie Beck, John Kitsuse, Ray Mack, Charlie Moskos, Arnold Feldman, and Scott Greer on the sociology faculty and Donald Campbell, Edward T. Hall, Tom Cook, Direct all correspondence toClinton R. Sanders, University of Connecticut (Emeritus), 3836 E.

Largely consumed with the mundane drudgery of being a young graduate student, I had little direct exposure to, or particular interest in, the (so-called) Chicago School of sociology or the symbolic interactionist perspective conventionally associated with it.3 In fact, I don’t recall any of us having any particularly intense interest in sociological theory at all. I do remember that many of us in the cohort were quite taken with Peter Winch’s slim volume The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy ([1958] 2007) and Alfred Schutz (especially his essay ‘‘Concept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences,’’ 1954) was beginning to turn some heads. Erving Goffman, whose The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959) had convinced me as an undergraduate that there might be something to this sociology stuff, was also quite popular.4 Like the Chicago department in the post World War II era as described by Becker, the sociology department at NU at this time reflected ‘‘no coherent tradition’’ (Becker 1999:8). None of us had any identity as being associated with the Chicago school or as ‘‘spiritual descendants’’ (Becker 1999:7) of Mead, Hughes, Blumer, or the other foundational figures in that tradition. Enrolling in Howie’s fieldwork course in my second year was a major turning point. At the first class meeting we had all been informed that before the next session we would need to find a site in which to collect field data and be prepared to talk about what we were seeing. Although we had been given a massive bibliographic handout with both substantive and methodological references, there were no texts or assigned readings. The professor would sit at one end of a long table (there were more than 20 students in the course) with a cigarette dangling from his lips (ah, the good old days) and start each class with some version of ‘‘So, what’s been going on’’? And we would take turns telling stories about our experiences in the field. Howie was generally rather nondirective during class and there was little overt analysis or discussion of theoretical issues. Marge DeVault (1999) describes her own experience in Howie’s seminar similarly, touching on his opposition to starting a research project with preordained theoretical assumptions: (Becker) began each class as if he had no plan at all: ‘‘So what’s been happening?’’ he might ask. And from whatever we had to say he would make a lesson in fieldwork. Some people were frustrated by this style of pedagogy, feeling that nothing much was happening, but I found these sessions utterly enchanting. As the weeks went by, we could see projects developing, analyses arising from our confusions in the field. Howie pushed us; there were simply no excuses for not getting started. He conveyed a tremendous respect for the work we were doing, finding the seeds of significance in our beginner’ attempts at observation. He insisted that it was all very simple: we could just figure it out and write it down. And he pointed out that no project was really complete until it had been written up for publication. Here, too, gender did not appear unless we asked. Howie was impatient with the idea that one might come to a project with a feminist agenda; he didn’t believe in agendas and didn’t want to talk about them (p. 10). I eventually came to realize that Howie’s ‘‘impatience’’ with ‘‘agendas’’ did not reflect a desire to avoid theory construction or the use of theory as an analytic </page> <page sequence="3"> 218 Symbolic Interaction Volume 36, Number 2, 2013 tool. Instead, his goal was to keep us from carrying too many preconceived notions into the field that would blind us to what was going on.5 Howie saw conventional concepts, abstractions, and theoretical constructs as limiting data collection, at least early in the research process. As he puts it (Becker 1974b): (W)e often turn collective activity . . . into abstract nouns whose connection to people doing things together is tenuous. We then typically lose interest in the more mundane things people are actually doing. We ignore what we see because it is not abstract and chase after the invisible ‘‘forces’’ and ‘‘conditions’’ we have learned to think sociology is all about. Novice sociologists frequently have great trouble doing field research because they do not recognize sociology, as they have read it, in the human activity they see all around them (p. 50). The fieldwork seminar was the first course I had with Becker. Later in my graduate student career I sat in on a seminar he taught with Donald Campbell and was a member of the first, very informal, seminar on the sociology of art (a trial run for the course that involved the formation of the ‘‘tactile art group’’ that he describes in Art Worlds; Becker 1982:71–72, 205, 209). A bit later my friend Eric Schaps and I regularly turned to Howie for advice when we were collecting data and writing up an interview-based study focused on the local campus drug using community (Schaps and Sanders 1970). Eventually, I used some of the data collected in that study, together with interviews and field data collected in narcotics court and while hanging out with narcotics officers and attorneys, as part of my dissertation focused on recreational drug users’ experience with drug enforcement (Sanders 1975). Howie was always generous with his time and usually appeared interested in my work. However, he was rather laissez faire in the way he dealt with my research. He would make occasional suggestions about things to read (I remember he was pretty high on the mathematician George Polya’s 1954 Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning at the time—an affection which, like the book, I found difficult to understand), but basically let me go my own way. Some of those who worked with Howie interpreted his unobtrusive style of dealing with graduate students as neglectful, but we all eventually came to understand that we should ask for what we needed and, otherwise, act like the professional sociologists we were becoming.6 BECKER’S INFLUENCE ON THE DISCIPLINE Howard S. Becker was born in Chicago in 1928. He received both his undergraduate degree (1946) and PhD (1951) from theUniversity of Chicago.AtChicago he studied with, among others, Everett Hughes andW. LloydWarner both of whom he regards asmajor influences.7 His fellow students at Chicago includedErvingGoffman,David Gold, Eliot Freidson, James Short, Albert Reiss, and a variety of other eventually well-known sociologists. Initially more interested in playing piano in a dance band than being a student, Becker eventually merged his interests and wrote his master’s thesis on professional musicians. He moved on, under Hughes’s guidance, to study </page> <page sequence="4"> Learning from Becker 219 and write his dissertation on public school teachers. After receiving his PhD Becker was involved with a variety of research projects at the University of Illinois, the Institute for Juvenile Research in Chicago (where he collected the interviews he used to discuss marihuana use), and in Kansas City (working with Everett Hughes on projects like Boys in White: Student Culture in Medical School, Becker et al. 1961 andMaking the Grade: The Academic Side of College Life, Becker et al. 1968). Becker also spent a few years at the Institute for the Study of Human Problems at Stanford. He joined the sociology faculty at NU in 1965. Becker has had major influence in various substantive areas of sociology. Early in his career he saw himself as most involved with social psychology and, due to Hughes’s influence, with occupations and professions (Becker 1986a:33).8 Later, because of his research experiences at the University of Kansas, he came to identify the sociology of education as his central interest (Becker 1986a:34). This focus on education/learning and occupations was brought to bear one of Howie’s most well-known areas of influence—deviance. Rather than asking the less than fruitful question of why people break rules, Becker came to focus on how people go through an identifiable process to choose to break rules, (sometimes) decide to continue to break rules, (sometimes) come to see themselves as rule-breakers, and (sometimes) encounter people who can do bad things to them when they find out about the rule-breaking. Deviants, he said, go through a kind of ‘‘career.’’ They learn to violate rules and that rule-breaking exists in a cooperative and conflictual world. Being a deviant is a matter of being labeled as such rather than necessarily having broken some rule or another. Understandably, this orientation to defined deviance as having as much to do with those who establish and enforce rules as it does with those who break the rules and that avoids theorizing about the etiology of rule-breaking met with some amount of disagreement (Becker 1974b, 1986a:34; the seminal presentation of labeling theory is in Becker 1963). Howie’s attention to occupational activities and his emphasis on the shared understandings that underlie them later came to be central ideas in the sociological study of art and artistic production upon which he has also focused. Rather than being the consequence of individual creative activities, art works, from Becker’s perspective, arise from the ‘‘collective action’’ (Becker 1974a) of a variety of loosely or closely connected social actors.9 These actors—instrument makers, musicians, composers, talent agents, limo drivers, and so forth—exist within the context of an ‘‘art world’’ that is bound together by ‘‘conventions’’—the shared understandings that make collective action possible (or, at least, easier). Artistic conventions also provide the basis for evaluating the quality of a work. Here Howie again alludes to his ideas about the basic feature of deviance. Deviance is not a quality of the act and the worthiness of art products is not (necessarily) based on ‘‘objective’’ esthetic criteria. Instead, both behavior that is regarded as ‘‘deviance’’ and what constitutes, and is praise-worthy, and ‘‘art’’ are consequences of the ability of certain actors with the power to label certain acts or products inside or outside certain elemental boundaries.10 Becker, in short, has advocated and expanded what has come to </page> <page sequence="5"> 220 Symbolic Interaction Volume 36, Number 2, 2013 be known as the ‘‘institutional theory of art’’ (Dickie 1974). Given his long-term personal involvement with both musical performance and photography, much of Howie’s exploration of these ideas has come within the context of musicians playing together (Becker 2000; Becker andFaulkner 2009) and themaking and interpretative evaluation of photographs (Becker 1974c, 1998b–1999, 1999, 2007:186–203).11 Becker’s thought and work also have been of special significance in area of sociological methods—especially qualitative methods. His approach to sociology was shaped by his involvement with Hughes who stressed the importance of research as opposed to Blumer’s emphasis on generating theoretical constructs. What Howie does draw from Blumer is the view that the method one uses should be decided on the basis of the characteristics of the group and situation being studied (Blumer 1969:60; see also Maines 2001:7). In turn, like both of these central interactionist figures, Becker holds that direct involvement in social life is the ideal way to find out about the collective behavior of groups and the conventional understandings that underlie it. His orientation to doing qualitative research has become the dominant model. One enters a field setting and begins to collect observational and conversational data. He or she then uses these observations to shape later data collection and analysis. As Howie recently described this ‘‘iterative’’ process: Successful researchers recognize that they begin their work knowing very little about their object of study, and that they use what they learn from day to day to guide their subsequent decisions about what to observe, who to interview, what to look for, and what to ask about. They interpret data as they get it, over periods of months or years, not waiting (in the fashion of a survey analysis, for instance) until they have it all in to start seeing what it means. They make preliminary interpretations, raise the questions thus interpretations suggest as crucial test of those ideas, and return to the field to gather the data that will make those tests possible. (Becker 2009:547)12 The primary virtue of this style of research is that it is ‘‘Designed in the doing . . . (and) therefore not systematic in any impersonal way; . . . (it) leaves room for, indeed insists on, individual judgment; . . . (it) takes account of historical, situated detail, and context and all that’’ (Becker 1993:219). Along the way, Howie’s work and ideas have been set upon by various critics. His interactionist perspective on deviance has been criticized for, among other ‘‘failings,’’ as not dealing with etiological issues of misbehavior, not offering a condemnation of real deviance, and for being deterministic (see Becker 1974a, 1974b, 1974c for his responses to these critiques). His methodological position has been attacked in similar terms—as not being rigorously ‘‘scientific,’’ and as demonstrating a seeming aversion to the overt use of sociological research to direct ameliorative social change (see Becker et al. 2004). Becker’s response to the first methodological criticism is that the ideal model of the natural sciences is rarely one which is used by scientists in actual practice (Becker 2009:547). He also emphasizes that doing research in the way he advocates employs ‘‘a systematic, rigorous, theoretically informed investigative procedure’’ (Becker 2009:548). In dealingwith the second supposedweaknessHowie </page> <page sequence="6"> Learning from Becker 221 has offered a critique of ‘‘sentimentality’’ as a research danger and emphasized the key role played by the ‘‘hierarchy of credibility’’ that exists within all organized social settings. Sentimentality acts as empirical blinders. As Becker describes it: We can, for a start, try to avoid sentimentality. We are sentimental when we refuse, for whatever reason, to investigate some matter that should properly be regarded as problematic. We are sentimental, especially, when our reason is that we would prefer not to know what is going on, if to know would be to violate some sympathy whose existence we may not ever be aware of. Whatever side we are on, we must use our techniques impartially enough that a belief to which we are especially sympathetic could be proven untrue. We must always inspect our work carefully enough to know whether our techniques and theories are open enough to allow that possibility. (Becker 1967:246)13 Becker’s notion of the hierarchy of credibility derives from the basic idea that all of the social settings qualitative researchers explore are unequally structured and, consequently, all of their research is potentially subversive of that structure. Given that the conventional presumption in all organized social settings is that those with more power know more about how things ‘‘actually’’ work, in looking behind the conventions of the setting—what ‘‘everyone knows’’—qualitative researchers call into question the established order. However, Becker also emphasizes that everyone within a social setting is subject to control exercised by someone above them (Becker 1967:246–47). Another area in which Howie’s work has had methodological impact is in the presentation of research findings. Again, he is a strong advocate of Hughes’s position that one’s research is not finished until it is published and frequently has told the story of submitting a paper to Hughes who was, at the time, editor of the American Journal of Sociology and getting back a scathing attack on his ponderous writing style (Plummer 2003:27). Encouraged by this criticism early on, and reflecting the direct way he approaches and describes situations and ideas, Howie has emphasized a writing style that is similarly direct, active, and unencumbered, to the extent possible, with unnecessary jargon. His position is that sociologists should write so that any reasonably educated person can understand what they have written (and, hopefully, find something instructive and interesting in it) (Becker 1986b).14 BECKER’S PERSONAL INFLUENCE Over the years I have known a good number of people who studied with Howard Becker and none of them have come away from the experience unscathed. While not entirely to blame, working with Howie did have considerable impact on the substantive issues on which I have focused in my career and my orientation to how to gather data and make sense of information about the social world. Most of what I learned fromHowie was largely through osmosis since, as I have said, he was reticent about overtly directing or requiring me—or any of his students—to do anything in particular. He would, of course, make suggestions about something I might read </page> <page sequence="7"> 222 Symbolic Interaction Volume 36, Number 2, 2013 that could be useful or how I might think about something, but he seemed to trust that I could do what I needed to do and, if I wanted advice, to ask for it.15 I have adopted a similar orientation toward dealing with my own graduate students. I tell them that I am a resource for them and not their mother. I will not direct, cajole, or nag them since I presume they are adults and can keep in mind Spencer Cahill’s mantra about how to handle a more-or-less successful academic career, ‘‘Go to your desk, sit down, and do your work.’’16 I also organize my qualitative methods seminars in much the same way as Howie did his. Students are required to choose a field setting and start observing writing fieldnotes during the week following the first meeting.17 Most of the sessions are taken up with our talking about what happened in the field that week and the final class periods are devoted to the students presenting their research thus far. Somewhat out of concern for their mental health, I do give them specific reading material and spend a short time at the end of each class (if there is time) presenting some methodological instructions I think are important. I am always struck by how the problems I and my fellow novice fieldworkers grappled with (e.g., ‘‘What if I am not there when something important happens’’? ‘‘I have some problems with collecting data on people who are actually my friends’’) continue to arise. Typically I respond in the way I recall Howie responding; usually some version of, ‘‘Well, what do you think’’? I emphasize that doing fieldwork is difficult and requires considerable discipline and courage (they quickly come to realize this on their own), that they should avoid preconceptions as much as possible,18 and that their goal should be to use the data they collect as the basis for a publication. I also focus the process of analyzing field data by emphasizing that the central key to use when examining their data is to ask, ‘‘What is this like’’? This exercise is sometimes shaped by what Becker (1998:125–28) describes as the ‘‘Bernie Beck Trick.’’ I ask them to try to describe what they have discovered without making direct reference to the specific setting, actors, or phenomena they studied. Another Important lesson I learned from Howie and stress to my own field- work students is that the natural tendency to ask ‘‘why’’? Is not a terribly productive approach. When a participant in the field is confronted with the ‘‘why question,’’ he or she is required to construct a reasonable (and, often, identity enhancing) response. The answer is strongly constrained by the ‘‘vocab- ulary of motive’’ phenomenon with which interactionists are so familiar (Mills 1940; Stokes and Hewitt 1976). As Becker stressed to us, I suggest to my own students that focusing on process and asking ‘‘how’’? can be a much more fruit- ful route to acquiring useful information. Howie told us that asking ‘‘why’’? only invited participants to do the analytic work that we ourselves should be doing (Molotch 2012:428–29). My experience with Becker has also had considerable impact on the specific kinds of social phenomenaand socialworlds I have lookedat.He showedme that itwas pos- sible to continue to do those things I found enjoyable and interact with people I found </page> <page sequence="8"> Learning from Becker 223 interesting and still do sociology. One of my first publications was based on the work I did in Howie’s seminar on the work-lives of the club musicians with whom I was spending much of my time (Sanders 1974). Another one of my early works examined aspects of the everyday experience of recreational drug users, another group inwhich I regularly interacted (Schaps and Sanders 1970). Later in my career I again merged my work life and personal life and began to focus on the relationship between dogs and their caretakers. Again, Howie’s example was instructive since one aspect of canine-human interaction I examined was how people dealt with public situations in which their dogs misbehaved. These ‘‘excusing tactics’’ are of special impor- tance since the animal-human ‘‘with’’ constitutes a unit that is collectively defined as deviantwhen thedogviolates expectations. This requires the caretaker to, essentially, take steps to redefine the dog’s deviance as understandable, if not entirely acceptable (Sanders 1990).19 My substantive interests were further shaped by my experience with Howie as I came increasingly to focus on occupational activities—again primarily in the context of human-animal relationships. I did fieldwork with and wrote about the work-lives of guide dog trainers, veterinarians, K-9 police officers, and veterinary technicians (Sanders 1999, 2006). Howie’s legacy was particularly apparent in the study of veteri- nary technicians (Sanders 2010) in that I not only focused on amundane occupational activity, but also used Everett Hughes’s (1962) concept of ‘‘dirty work’’ to orient the discussion.Also, central to binding thisworkonhuman-animal relationships together and connecting it to Becker’s legacy is my use of the idea of ‘‘collective action’’ which plays such a primary role in Howie’s sociology. For my work, this merger of interac- tants’ definition of the situation, their understanding of each other, and their attempts to collectively orchestrate interaction are of special interest in that one of the parties is alingual. This close attention to human-animal relationships led, in turn, to my small attempt to expand symbolic interactionist thought as the key matters of the social construction of mind, self, identity, and personhood came to the fore (Sanders 2003, 2007; see also Irvine 2012) and I came to see the conventional interactionist reliance on language as the vehicle for these collective constructions as somewhat problematic.20 Perhaps the most direct impact of my contact with Becker early in the process of becoming a sociologist is seen in my discussions of artistic production and occupations. Again, I merged two matters of special interest to Howie and studied the cultural and occupational world surrounding a particular art form that had added appeal in that it was (at the time) definably deviant. Here I somewhat expanded on Becker’s concern with artistic conventions and how their violation causes occupational problems for artists. Here I stressed that certain features of tattooing as seen by those outside of the occupational world of the practice caused identifiable problems for tattoo artists. Furthermore, the potentially stigmatizing effect of the art pieces for both casual and committed collectors added to the appealing interest of the phenomenon. Given the problematic features of tattooing I came to be particularly interested the movement of tattooing from being a craft to </page> <page sequence="9"> 224 Symbolic Interaction Volume 36, Number 2, 2013 being a marginally recognized fine art form. Here the ‘‘institutional theory’’ of art of which Howie was so fond helped to shape my orientation to this definitional process. I outlined the product characteristics—demonstration of skill, academic/critical attention, esthetic value, and so forth—that could lead to tattooing being recognized as a ‘‘real’’ fine art form (Sanders 1989:149–63).21 CONCLUSION Like most of those for whom Howie has acted as mentor, my general perspective as a sociologist and orientations toward the substantive issues upon which I have decided to focus were significantly shaped by my association with Becker. I learned not so much from direct teaching as from example. I learned not just to look but to see beyond the obvious, to feel but avoid the blinders of sentimental allegiance to ideology, to love the freedom offered by doing fieldwork while not giving in to the fear and uncertainty that are part of it. I learned to value direct experience of the social world and to allow that experience to direct the analytic process that I have come to see as central this thing I do. Gouldner (1970) has observed that we favor a particular theoretical per- spective based on the emotional resonance that perspective has for us. While he did not proselytize, Howie demonstrated for us, his students, that inter- actionism can act as a useful guide to a methodological approach and as an effective route to understanding the social situations, interactions, and relation- ships in which we were interested. As Becker has described the virtues of interactionism: The symbolic interactionist point of view requires you to take into account more things than almost any other perspective. At least, it disposes you to do your research in such a way that if anything is obviously (or not so obviously) affecting the phenomenon you want to understand, you’ll be free to take advantage of finding that out. (Becker 1986a:42)22 I encountered Howie at an important time in my life and during an interesting era in political and cultural history. I learned fromhim that doing interactionist sociology could possibly lead—if combined with discipline and intellectual excitement—to something for which, at the time, I was looking. For, as Anselm Strauss succinctly described Becker’s work, ‘‘You’re easy....It’s liberty, freedom, that’s what you’re interested in’’ (Plummer 2003:36). This freedom is not only seen in Becker’s work, it was central to his approach to students. It is also part of what is best about symbolic interactionism which (P)retends neither to absolute truth nor to an exhaustive interpretation of society. It is unusual in its acceptance of uncertainty and a modest scope....Interactionism does not offer a definitive ontology, but merely stresses the difficulties which are involved in describing human affairs (Rock 1979:2). </page> <page sequence="10"> Learning from Becker 225 NOTES 1. I had attended a well-known religiously oriented college near the city, but was asked to leave because of accumulated rule infractions. I finished my undergraduate education at the University of Connecticut and there, fortuitously, was taken under the intellectual wing of J. David Colfax. 2. I will in this discussion usually refer to Professor Becker as ‘‘Howie’’ since that is what I, and everyone I have ever known that has known or worked with him, have always called him (see Molotch 2012:421). 3. Though the Northwestern department had some sort of cooperative arrangement with the University of Chicago, I knew only a few people who took advantage of this resource. The major contact I, and my friends, had with the institution was to occasionally drive down to the south side to attend musical or political events. However, a few years later, I was employed as a researcher in the epidemiology program of the University of Chicago’s psychiatry department and spent quite a bit of time on and around the campus. 4. After we had both read Goffman’s Behavior in Public Places (1963) I remember a friend in the cohort observing with admiration, ‘‘This guy has been looking in our windows.’’ 5. Becker (1967) made use of the idea of ‘‘sentimentality’’ in discussing this issue in the larger frame of political commitments. I will discuss this point in a bit. 6. I remember him telling one of his students who voiced concern over his not being more overtly approving of her work that, ‘‘Once you learn to walk, you can’t expect to be praised every time you walk.’’ 7. For Becker’s description of his experiences at the University of Chicago see, for example, the interviews conducted by Kenneth Plummer (2003) and Julius Debro (in Becker 1986a:25–46). His article discounting the ‘‘real’’ existence of the Chicago School (Becker 1999) is also instructive. 8. Howie says that he took a course in fieldwork with Ernest Burgess while playing piano in Chicago bars. When he showed the fieldnotes he was taking to Burgess he was told that his focus was clearly on occupations and professions and was sent to Hughes. Hughes, in turn, was pleased with the observations since most of the students who were working in the area focused on professional work and Howie was looking at a ‘‘low-brow’’ occupation (Molotch 2012:434). 9. Howie describes his initial interest in the sociological study of art: I thought at the time that the sociology of art was a really underdeveloped area, because it was mostly in the hands of people who were pretty much aestheticians . . .whose work was a thinly disguised way of making and jus- tifying judgments of value in various arts. And I thought that this was not really all that could be done. (Plummer 2003:24) 10. Becker’s initial statement of his perspective on art is his classic article ‘‘Art as Collective Action’’ (1974a). His views were later expanded in the book Art Worlds (1982). 11. I recall once asking Howie early in his involvement with photography to describe the elements of a ‘‘good’’ photograph. Clearly taken aback by this naive graduate student-like question he answered with a version of Ansel Adams succinct statement that ‘‘There are no rules for good photographs. There are only good photographs’’ (http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/photographs.html, Retrieved January 24, 2011). I was not entirely satisfied with this response but accepted that Howie often answered questions with zen-like statements (see Molotch 2012:436–37). 12. For an extended presentation of methodological ideas and prescriptions see Becker 1998. 13. To a major degree, Becker’s concern with the limiting effects of sentimental theoretical and political allegiances flows from his decidedly skeptical view of conventionality. As he puts </page> <page sequence="11"> 226 Symbolic Interaction Volume 36, Number 2, 2013 it with regard to method: ‘‘Exemplary qualitative research typically shows that conventional ways of framing and answering research questions often rest on an acceptance of conventional understandings that hide what we should be studying’’ (Becker 2009:550). 14. Howie has also moved beyond presenting sociological findings and ideas through the written word.He has explored, for example, theatrical performance as a vehicle for presenting field data (Becker and McCall 1990; Becker et al. 1989) and has participated in numerous photographic exhibitions focused on his sociologically relevant works. 15. I only remember two times when Howie gave me actual advice. Once when I was wondering about how I should organize my career just before I received my degree (as I recall I was trying to decide between seriously getting into playing music or finishing graduate work and moving into a conventional academic job), he observed (I paraphrase), ‘‘When you come to a point where you have to make a difficult decision like this and all the alternatives seem to have some appeal, in the long run, it doesn’t matter which you choose.’’ The second piece of advice came when I was heading off for my first academic job. Howie cautioned, ‘‘Watch your ass.’’ 16. See Merrill 2007. 17. The description of the seminar on my syllabus starts with, ‘‘Doing fieldwork is a lot like swimming—you can’t learn it out of books and when you do it for the first time you can expect to swallow a lot of water.’’ 18. For the past few years, a good number of the women students have come into the seminar much taken with the basic ideas of ‘‘institutional ethnography’’ a la Dorothy Smith. I acknowledge that this is an interesting way to look at interaction situations, especially work settings, but try to convince them to see the various preconceptions of this perspective/approach as things to question rather than things to assume. Sometimes I am successful. 19. This theme of deviance in the human-animal relationship was carried on in an occupational context when I examined how veterinarians deal with problems presented by their animal patients (Sanders 1994). 20. Not all interactionists have been thrilled with or convinced by my questioning of the ‘‘ligua- centric’’ aspects of interactionism. They tend to regardme as suffering from anthropomorphism (see, for example, Meltzer 2003:265). 21. In the revised and expanded version of Customizing the Body by Sanders (2008) I add discus- sions of serious tattoo collectors and how the social world surrounding tattooing developed over two decades. 22. Despite the fact that Becker is a major figure within interactionism and has been centrally involved with the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction from the beginning (he was president in 1977–1978 and has won all of the organization’s major awards), he has not been entirely uncritical of the perspective. When asked in an interview why he ‘‘never’’ used the term symbolic interaction (not an entirely true accusation), Howie replied: I don’t know what it means. I mean it like all those ‘‘school’’ titles, you know, labels—they’re appropriated by all kinds of people for all kinds or reasons. So when I look at the journal Symbolic Interaction, I don’t recognize what is in there as remotely connected to anything I’m interested in (Plummer 2003:23). REFERENCES Becker, Howard S. 1963.
