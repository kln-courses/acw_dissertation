<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Museum Acquisitions Buddhist Stele (Krannert Art Museum) BY MURIEL B. CHRISTISON THE Krannert Art Museum has recently acquired a Buddhist stele, carved in the second century A.D. in Gandhara, the name used to designate an ancient region northwest of the border of present-day India and comprising part of what are now Pakistan and Afghanistan (Fig.47). This territory marked the eastern limits of the conquest by Alexander the Great. The Kushans, a Sythian people from Central Asia, gained control of this region in the first century A.D. Their emperors maintained close contact with the Roman world, and it is probable that Roman craftsmen, especi- ally from east Mediterranean centres, worked in Gandhara. There was widespread development of Buddhism in Gandhara during the Kushan period, particularly under the second-century emperor, Kanishka, who established sacred Buddhist sites. A need for Buddhist images increased, and the anthropomorphic repre- sentations of the Buddha were formulated. In producing the early anthropomorphic Buddhist images, the Kushans relied on the sacred texts, on traditional concepts and their symbols (many deriving from ancient Vedic mythology), and on Greco-Roman sculptural prototypes. The images ordin- arily were painted and gilded. Traces of paint remain on this Gandharan schist stele, particularly in the recessed background areas. As pointed out by Benjamin Rowland (letter of 6th December 1965 in Krannert Art Museum file), the stele may have been attached as a blind window or door to a stupa or have occupied a niche of a vihara court. The Buddha, already characterized by magical marks such as the urna, or third eye in the centre of the forehead, the ushnisha, or bulge at the top of the Buddha's head, and the elongated ear- lobes, is shown in a typical monastic garment resembling, and undoubtedly derived from, the Roman toga. Behind him is a halo, a feature found in earlier representations of Ahura Mazda in the Persian pantheon. Buddha is seated on the lotus pedestal, as became customary in second-century art in Gandhara. In accord with interpretations of earlier Vedic symbolism and of the Buddhist Pali and Sanskrit texts, the stem of the lotus represented the vertical axis of the universe. Thus the Buddha is seated at the navel centre of the World-Wheel, in the centre of the Circle of Wisdom. The lotus may be regarded as the Earth plane supporting the Buddha who becomes the Wheel. In an abstract sense, it refers to the Great Awakening beneath the Bodhi-tree in the Deer Park at Benares, the site of the First Preach- ing, or the First Turning of the Wheel of the Word. The pillars in the lower register of the stele recall capitals at Persepolis, but pillars and shelter also may suggest the actual site of the First Preaching, with the paired deer flanking the lion on the impost block on the capital, symbolizing the location. The pillar with the lotus capital and the lion impost also bears some resemblance to symbolic representations of the world-pillar and lion throne, though used in an accessory rather than axial position here. The stem of the lotus throne extends downwards into the waters where the throne is supported by Nagas, spirits of the lower waters. The mystical analogy is to the miraculous birth of Buddha, as well as to earlier Vedic mythology, in which the deity is born in the water and rises from it full-grown. HinayLnist Buddhism (Lesser Vehicle) of the second century A.D. represented Gautama Buddha (Siddhartha) and scenes from his life, also the next Buddha, the Bodhisattva Maitreya and the Buddhas of the past. It is not unusual, therefore, to find the Buddha flanked by the Bodhisattva Maitreya in the sculpture of this period. Mr Rowland notes that the figure to the left of the Buddha in the Krannert Art Museum stele should be Maitreya. In a later but analogous relief from Karli the Buddha is shown within a pillared shelter, seated on the world axis between two flanking figures. In this later and more developed representation of Buddhist iconography, these are identified as the Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Avalokiteivara. In descriptions of Paradise, the Bodhisattvas and disciples are envisioned standing on smaller lotuses in the spiritual company of the Buddha. In the tympanum, or upper register, of this stele Mr Rowland indicates that the subject should represent Maitreya 630</page><page sequence="2">I II ?- - ~I 1 : -..

Stele. Buddhist (Gandhdra), second century A.D. Marble Schist relief; height, 79 cm. (Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois, Champaign). Gift of Mrs Ellnora D. Krannert, 1965.</page><page sequence="3">RECENT MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS in the Tushita Heaven, the realm of the thirty-three Vedic gods.; Worshippers are supported on small blossoms; the central figure is in frontal position beneath a domical canopy resembling the stupa in similar reliefs. An especially interesting feature of the stele is the arcade framing attendants or adorants in the middle register of the stele, with birds (eagles ?) in the spandrels of the arches. Mr Rowland has explored the occurrence and meaning of related motifs in Gandhdran, Early Christian, Late Classic and Near Eastern art in his definitive article, 'Gandhdra and Early Christian Art: The Homme-Arcade and the Date of the Bimaran Reliquary', in The Art Bulletin, XXVIII, No.i (March 1946) PP.44-7- In a formative period of Buddhist iconography the use of these arcaded figures may depend upon contemporary and earlier Indian sculpture as well as foretell an amalgamation with Near Eastern and Late Classic styles and the adoption from it of the homme-arcade motif, when, as Mr Rowland states, 'The Buddhas on the stupas of Gandhira, sitting or standing in a palatial architectural setting of mixed classical and Indian form, could then be said to be a primitive form of the Paradise iconography. .' (Rowland, op. cit., P.47). The crisp quality of the carving, plastic articulation of form, and illusionistic relationship of the figures in this stele, the fine state of preservation, the richness of the entire composition and its relationship to pre-Buddhist, Vedic thought and to developed Buddhist imagery, the stylistic derivations from Hindu, Middle Eastern and Late Classic motifs and figure styles as well as the indications of mature Buddhist formulas, make this object an important addition to a university teaching collection.</page></plain_text>
