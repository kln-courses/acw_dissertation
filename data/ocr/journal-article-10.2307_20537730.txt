<plain_text><page sequence="1">Five Problems in Callimachus' Hymn to Apollo by Frederick Williams This paper is a slightly modified version of a seminar given in Italian, under the title of Problemi di interpretazione in Calli maco, at the Istituto di Filolog?a Classica of the University of Urbino \ It consists of discussions of five passages in the Hymn to Apollo which present problems of linguistic and literary inter pretation. In a sense it is also a kind of progress report, since it offers a small sample of my forthcoming commentary on the Hymn, which will form part of the collaborative work on the Callimachean hymns announced by Giuseppe Giangrande in his bibliographical report of Hellenistic Poetry in 1968 2. (I) Line 4 : ouj( ?p?ac; sttsvs^ctsv o AtqXio? fjStS ti &lt;po?vi? It is important to bear in mind that the subject of the poem as a whole is a supposed epiphany of Apollo occurring in the context of the celebration of the Carneia at Cyrene, the poet's native city 3. Callimachus has already mentioned several indications of the imminent appearance of the god : the laurel is shaking (a Delphic 11 would like here to express my gratitude to the Central Research Fund Committee of the University of London, which made possible my visit to Urbino, and to Professor Bruno Gentili and his colleagues for their generous hospitality and their valuable comments on my work both in informal discussion and at the seminar. 2 Fifty Years (and Twelve) of Classical Scholarship (Oxford 1968) 288. 8 Space forbids the discussion of this problem here, and for the moment I refer the reader to G. Pasquali, Quaestiones Callimacheae (G?ttingen 1913) part I, passim, and P. Fraser, Ptolemaic Alexandria II (Oxford 1972) 917 n. 292.</page><page sequence="2">128 F. Williams element, incidentally)4, the whole building is trembling : the god is kicking at the doors of the temple. Now moreover one can see that the " Delian " palm-tree ' nods pleasantly '5. The question confronting us here has two aspects : first, why is this palm-tree described as " Delian "? Secondly, why does Callimachus mention this sign as evidence for the coming epiphany? Scholars in the past have tended to concentrate on the first aspect, without reaching a satisfactory solution ; possibly the second aspect may prove more profitable. Quite clearly, the worshippers gathered before Apollo's temple in Cyrene cannot literally see any tree on the island of Delos, hundreds of kilometers away. This led Studniczka to argue, with manifest implausibility, that the setting of the hymn was not Cyrene at all, but Delos 6. The same consideration led Wilamo witz7, followed by Cahen 8, to assert that AtqXio? was a mere epitheton ornons : but this is a desperate suggestion, tantamount to saying that AyjXio? is meaningless in this context. (I would add that the concept of the epitheton ornans, while it seems to make the life of commentators easier, is perilous in Alexandrian poetry, where one should always proceed on the assumption that an adjective is expressive, not ornamental). Nevertheless, as every schoolboy knows, there was in fact a very famous and important palm-tree on Delos : Odysseus admired it, and when he chanced to meet a beautiful girl on the beach in Scheria, he compared her with it: AyjXco Sy) tuots toI'ov 5A7??AX(uvo&lt;; rcap? ?cofxco &lt;poivtxo? v?ov spvo? ?vepx?fxevov ?vovjaa.

Se (potvixi ?aXs 7ri)xee* Y?^va S'?psics Xsi[x?vi [laXaxco, [xstSyjas Se yea u*rc?vsp&amp;sv. (h. Horn. Ap. 117-8) 9 This account is found also in Theognis (1,5 ff.) and in Callimachus himself (h. 4,209 if.). The Delian palm-tree (in the literal sense) had therefore a close and long-standing association with Apollo; but it would seem impossible, for the reason already stated, for this particular tree to be referred to here. With great ingenuity Maass10 proposed a solution of this apparent difficulty : he suggested that this " Delian palm " could well be a seedling of the Delian palm, a direct descendant of the noble tree admired by Leto, Theseus, and Odys seus; in the same way Ovid describes an oak in the precinct of Zeus at Aegina as sacra Iovi quercus de semine Dodonaeo (Met. 7,623). It is an attractive hypothesis, and I would happily believe, if there were evidence to justify it, that at Cyrene, perhaps indeed at every great sanctuary of Apollo, there was a " Delian " palm and a "Delphic" laurel11. However that may be, I contend that for our understanding of Callimachus' text, such intriguing possibilities of religious arbo riculture should take second place to poetic diction. In epic, emvs?siv is a precise term, meaning almost always * nod assent ', and the subject is almost always a god ; for example : 9), xal xuav?yjatv s7u' 6&lt;pp\)Gi vsuas Kpovtcov (77. 1,528); 9 In the phrase [xsiSrjas $? ya.V uTu?vep^ev we have an explanation of the simil arly anthropomorphic ifib 11 in Callimachus: both reflect the motif of the joy of nature at Apollo's coming: see Allen-Halliday-Sikes, ad loc. 10 Hermes 25 (1890) 403. 11 Such a theory would suit the general outlook of the hymn, in which all aspects of the worship of Apollo are seen as finding their culmination at Cyrene. 9</page><page sequence="4">130 F.

Thus, in the line under discussion, learned readers well-versed in Homeric language would read sreveuorsv and be led to expect a divine subject, reasonably enough in the context. The next words, ? Ay)Xt.o?, seem to fulfil this expectation : here is the Delian (or indeed * the one who manifests himself ', another ancient etymology of AtjXio? as a title of Apollo)14 ? Apollo has consented to appear. This impression is re-inforced by tjS? ti. Only in the very last syllable of the verse are the reader's expectations, carefully fostered by the poet, proved false : instead of Ooi?oc we read &lt;po?vi? ? a tree. The poet has set a neat trap ; his reader falls into it. I mentioned a moment ago that emvs?av means ' nod assent ' almost always in Homer, that its subject is almost always a god. There is a single exception to both rules : in Iliad 22, Achilles is thus described as he takes the field against Hector : x?pDah S'stovsus ?aswyj T?Tpa&lt;p?Xco, xaXal Ss TCpio-tfeiovTo s&amp;sipai Xp?crsiat, ot?

By alluding to this exceptional Homeric usage ? such epic rarities, either of vocabulary or of syntax, always fascinated the scholar-poets of Alexandria16 ? Callimachus subtly suggests the extent of his Homeric scholarship. At the same time, he has played an elegant joke on his readers, leading them to expect, right up to the very last moment, that cTc?vsucrsv is being used in its more normal sense17. (II) Line 9 : '?lrc?^cov ou 7uocvt? ?astveTai, ocXX'Sti? sa&amp;Xo? It ought to be one of the basic articles of our scholarly creed that it is at least possible that the author actually meant what the text says ; a truism, believers will think. But the most obvious truths are frequently ignored, with dire results, in scholarship as in religion. Cahen, in his note on this line, asserts that ?aeivsToci is equi valent to (paivsToc : " le mot n'est ici qu'une variatio peu justifiable de vocabulaire ". Similarly, Mair, in his Loeb edition, translates : " Not unto everyone doth Apollo appear, but unto him that is good ". LSJ, s. v. cas?vc?, inform their readers that in two places, here and at Ap. Rh. Arg. 4,1362, ?ae?vscr$at means no more than ' appear '18. Are we, one wonders, to imagine Callimachus as a fumbling amateur, trying like an English schoolboy to write * verses ', con tent if he succeeds, after hours of toil and frequent consultation 16 In fact, the very same rarity is reproduced also by Theocritus, in a hymn written in the epic style: ?fxcpoT?poi? 8? X?&lt;pcov ?Tc?veuov ?&amp;eipai (Id. 22,186): note that eTCsveuov there occupies the same sedes as ?jc?veue in Ho mer, and that in both passages ?&amp;sipou is a verse-ending. 17 For further examples of this technique, much favoured by the Alexandrians, cf. Giangrande, ' Sympotic Literature and Epigram ', Entretiens Hardt 14 (1968), 91-172, esp. 132, 143, 145. 18 Cf. the entry cpaivco, which also gives the impression that the words are not entirely distinct.</page><page sequence="6">132 F. Williams of the Gradus, in producing lines which just about scan, indifferent to the violence he has done to the meaning of precise Greek words in the process? If Callimachus were indeed the semi-literate hack some modern scholars would seem to think him, at least we could easily solve the old problem of why he was never promoted to the Headship of the Library ? the poor wretch could never have arranged the books in alphabetical order 19. Oastvo is an epic word ; in Homer it invariably means ' to shine, to give light ', the subject normally being the sun, as at Od. 3, 1-2: 'H?Xio? 8* ?v?pouae ... ... ?v'?&amp;avdcTOKtt ?asivoi or in Helios' threat at Od. 12,383 : S?aofxott s?? y AtSao xai ev vsx?som 9 a s ? v o 20.

Above all, this is true of Apollo, both in early poetry, e. g. the Homeric hymn to Apollo : 19 The extent to which scholars are prepared to denigrate the ancient authors whom they are ostensibly seeking to elucidate, blaming them for their own defi ciencies of understanding, never ceases to amaze me. In a forthcoming article (' The Humour of Colluthus ', to be published in Mus. Phil. Lond.) I shall cite some gruesome examples of this perversion. 20 Cf. Od. 12,385; 18,308 (braziers); 343 (Odysseus as torch-bearer). 21Phaen. 16, 148, 166, 189, 450, 619, 713, 789, 894, 905, 908, 1147: note that Aratus, one of Callimachus' most important stylistic models, uses the middle more often than the active. 22 " Miraculous light betokens the presence of the gods " (Allen-Halliday-Sikes</page><page sequence="7">Callimachus' Hymn to Apollo 133 sv&amp;'sx vy)0? #pouaev ?cvoc? sxaepyoc 'Atc?XXov ?aTspi eE86[xsvo?

This is the case, for instance, in Callimachus' Hymn to Artemis 29, where it is one of the punishments of the unjust that xeipovTou Se yspovTS? ?&lt;p' u?ao~w (126) ; in contrast, one of the blessings enjoyed by the just is that OUS5 ?7tl GY)[i,a spX0VTal rikty ?5ts 7To}a&gt;xp?w?v ti (p?pcocriv (131-2) Quite evidently, in the present passage this sense would be grotesque, and completely inappropriate to the youths' situation.

In the sixth book of the Anthology there are a number of epigrams written on the occasion of such dedications. Two exam ples are worth citing in full: TcpcoTa? ?7TCC?T5 hzz^z xaX?? EuSo^o? sfrsipa?

He exhorts the young to perform their religious duties: in return for their devotion to Apollo, they may expect the blessings of maturity (marriage), longevity (expressed in terms of piety continued throughout life, from youth to old age), and prosperity (here seen in the appropriately civic terms of the stability of the whole city of Cyrene). In other words, 7ioX^v ts xsps?cr&amp;ou conveys the notion of the chorus, now young, reaching old age, and continuing to offer their hair to Apollo even when it is white. This is a concept we have encountered, expressed in very similar language, in Rhianus and Antipater : it is foreshadowed in another famous hymn, sung by the chorus in Euripides' Heracles, a passage Callimachus alludes to elsewhere31 : TOxiava?

Xi&amp;o? (23). The word Sispo? occurs only twice in Homer, and in both places its meaning was problematic even in antiquity. At Od. 6, 201-3 Nausicaa declares that Scheria is inviolable: oux say o?to? ?vTjp Sispo? ?pOToc ouSs ysvvjTai o? xsv &lt;Dai7]X6)v ?vSpcov s? yaiav ?xvjTai Sy)?OT7)Ta 9spcov ...

D. 460 on) the normal meaning of Sispo? is * wet ', which would not fit, at least in the most literal sense, in the Homeric passages. We know, however, from the Homeric scholia to Od. 6, 201 that Aristarchus inter preted Sispo? there as ' living \ That Aristarchus was not indulg ing in mere speculation, but was transmitting an older interpre tation, is now made probable by Ibycus 282 Page, 25-6 : frvaTO?

Williams Life, that is, consists in liquidity; and in accordance with this view, the word aXi?ac ' corpse ' is derived from the negative prefix ?- and Xt?dcc ' drop of moisture '. The way of thinking which lies behind such etymological theories has been most usefully inves tigated by R. B. Onians 35, whose penetrating discussion deserves to be read in full : one sentence is particularly apposite : ... the liquid or liqu?fiable stuff of life and strength identified with the seed was the ' marrow ' of head and spine and of the thigh-bones and knees, and with this that element in the flesh which melts and issues as sweat and tears and appears to be above all the pale liquefying fat (p. 255: my italics). Both aspects of Stspo? as understood by the ancients them selves, that is, both ' living ' and ' wet ' are relevant in the present passage 36, and I suggest that Callimachus is using the technique of creative ambiguity. Certainly Niobe is ' wet ', because she is for ever weeping : but this very activity of weeping constitutes for her what remains of her life ; for Apollo and Artemis did not kill her with her children. Instead, she was transformed, still living 37, into the famous rock, and continued to shed her tears. My interpretation is supported by the close imitation of these lines by Nonnus : xai Nto?v] Swr?Xoto rcap? acpup? rarpo? e^ecpcov S?xpuai Xa?v?oiatv oSupofiivv) gtu/jx. tox?S?ov ?TYjasToa otxTp?v ocYoX(Jia ... (Dion. 12,79-81) (Leipzig 31882) 48 if.; he nevertheless poured scorn on the interpretation, and entitled the section ' Aristarchi error in vocabulo Siep?c '. A more mystical expla nation is offered by Porphyry, Ant. Nymph. 10. 35 The Origins of European Thought (Cambridge 1951) 254-6, cited by Chantrai ne, Diet. Et. s. v. Sispo? ? a discussion which marks a considerable advance on the thoroughly confused entry in LSJ. 36 A similar ambiguity exists, I believe, at Theoc. Id. 17,80, which I shall treat elsewhere. 37 Cf. A. P. 16,129 etc.; at Nonnus, Dion. 14,271-82 Niobe is credited with the powers of sight, thought, and speech.</page><page sequence="13">Callimachus' Hymn to Apollo 139 Nonnus is a faithful imitator of Callimachus, and following as ever the Alexandrian practice of imitatio cum variatione, he here re expresses the notion of Sispo? Xi&amp;o? in the phrase rarpo? ?x??pav 38 Callimachus' subtle insistence on the fact that Niobe was still, even as a rock, alive, is of course an implicit comment on another ancient Homeric controversy. It is well-known that lines 614-7 of Iliad 24, describing Niobe's metamorphosis, were athetized by Aristophanes and Aristarchus 39 ; it is clear from Philetas fr. 2 Powell40 that they were controversial at an earlier date. By emphasizing the metamorphosis aspect of the Niobe story, Calli machus is defending the vexed lines against " rationalist " criticism of the kind later taken up by Aristarchus, who asked "iz?c; S? xa! X&amp;o? yevo[i?vy? ftscav ?x xvjSsa useras!, ; ". In his use of the single word Sisp?c, which he places in the Homeric sedes, Callimachus has expressed his view on two Homeric problems : the meaning of Sispc? itself, and the authenticity of Iliad 24, 614-7.

(Pfeiffer II 51) The first interpretation, " those which are pastured with the sheep " is faulty for at least two reasons : it fails to explain the prefix zm-, and moreover the sense proposed would be utterly banal for such a recondite gloss. In antiquity, as even today in Mediterranean countries, it was normal for goats and sheep to be pastured to gether: hence Christ's analogy for the Last Judgement: a&lt;popis? auTo?? an ?XX7)X&lt;ov, &amp;&lt;mzp ? 7ioi[X7]v ?cpopi?si Ta 7?p6?a Ta orno tov spi&lt;pcov. (Matthew 25,32) ? that is, the sheep and goats had not previously been separated, but had been allowed to graze together 41. Further, this interpre tation " pasturing with the sheep " is inconsistent with the sub sequent observation that jxvjXa can be used of either goats or sheep. The scholia attest a variant reading ?[??rr?XaSs?, which is glossed as S^Xsiai (? " pregnant "); this word recurs in Hesychius: sjxp) XaSa? alya?* toc? [izr?. tcov 7rpo?aTiov vs[xo(xsva?, but with the interpre tation the scholia had, less plausibly, offered for s7U[A7)XaSs?. In short, the indirect tradition is thoroughly confused, and fails to account satisfactorily for the hapax. Modern scholars have fared no better, and have generally resorted to conjecture. For example, Ruhnken proposed sti pjx? Ss? " still bleating ", an expression which is admittedly Homeric, but in this context intolerably trivial : one expects the result of divine intervention to be more out of the ordinary. Similarly Bredau42 conjectured ?pi|X7]xaSs?. Schneider printed svijnQXaSs? " quae inter oves versantur "; Kuiper 43 accepted this conjecture, but took the word to mean " pregnant ". Alii alia 44 : no advance on the scholia. 41 Cf. Giangrande, ' Aphrodite and the Oak Trees \ Rev. Et. Ane, forthcoming. 42 De Callimacho verborum inventore (diss.

The solution I shall now propose is partly linguistic, partly zoological. The adjective stci^Xio? " protector of herds " was an epithet of Apollo at Camirus 45 (a Dorian city), where Apollo's sister Artemis was accorded the title ?mjxTqXt?io?, attested in an inscription almost contemporary with Callimachus 46. The form s7ul[X7]X?Ss? (fern, pi.) is used of Nymphs, with the same sense (see LSJ); Pausanias (8,4,2) records also smtrqXi.?&amp;sc. It was a constant practice of the Alexandrian poets to employ new adjectival formations, replacing the more normal endings by others more recondite : this was of course a development of a tendency which had existed in Greek poetry from the very earliest date 47. I cite a few well-known examples : SfxcoTQ (Horn.): Sfjwoic (Aesch., Eur., Ap. Rh.): fycpocc (Manetho) suTstyso? (Horn.): s?tsi^? (Pind., Eur.) Ay)to)o? (Aesch., Soph.): Ayjtc?loc? (Call.): At)t&lt;u?? (Ap. Rh. etc.) Xsx?&gt; (Eur., Aristoph., inscr.): Xs^c?i? (Call., Ap. Rh.): Xs^ona? (Nonnus). Bornmann 48 notes that " temi in -a? si alternano ... con quelli in -i? " and cites the examples of IleXacrYia?/ usXaaY?? and 'A^ocu?c/ 'Axau? 49. Another instance of this tendency is found in the very passage we are examining : &amp;y&lt;xX&lt;x? (52) is an innovation, the more ?oivto) (X7)x?Sec, proposed by R. Schmitt, Die Nominalbildung in den Dichtungen des Kallimachos von Kyrene (Wiesbaden 1970) 74 n. 10. 45 Macrobius 1,17,45; also of Hermes, another deus pastoralis, at Coronea, Paus. 9,34,2: the comparative lateness of these attestations is offset by the fact that they occur in antiquarian authors. 46 See LSJ Suppl. 47 See Risch, Wortbildung der homerischen Sprache (Berlin/Leipzig 1937) 130; Schwyzer I 464. 48 Callimachi Hymnus in Dianam (Florence 1968) 43. 49 Cf. Class. Quart. 21 (1971) 137-45, where I suggested that Theocritus exploited the equivalence of the forms A?xioc and AuxiSoc?.</page><page sequence="16">142 F. Williams usual form being ?yaXaxTo?. However, the most striking examples of this phenomenon in Callimachus are, by a remarkable coincid ence, both adjectives predicated of goats : at fr. 75,13 Callimachus writes a?ya? s? ?ypi?Sac, varying the common expression s?? ?yp?ac a?ya?; and at ep. 62,1, and also at line 61 of our present hymn, he uses Kuv&amp;iaSs? for K?v&amp;iai. In short : according to the linguistic rules of the Alexandrians, s7up)X?c is morphologically equivalent to smpjXio? / s7ui|jiy)XiSio? / s7ui[X7]Xi? / s7U[XY)Xia?, and therefore must be interpreted here as " protectress of flocks ". Now that we have determined the sense of the word, it remains to investigate its precise function in its context. This we can do by comparing the observations of Aristotle on the breeding of goats and sheep with the present passage : TiXTOuai Ss Ta fjisv 7uXsiGTa Suo, svioTS Ss xai Tpia 7) TSTTapa. x?si Ss 7rsvTS [XYJva? xai rcpo?aTOv xai a??.

These are precisely the conditions which Callimachus specifies here : fjo-iv 'AtoXXov ?&lt;p&amp;aX ?jiov S7njyaysv is another example of the identification of Apollo and the sun, and means, in prosaic terms, sv t?tcoic oaoi ?Xssivo? sien. Pasture is also stressed : ?oo-xofxsvTja5 (52, emphatically placed at the beginning of the line)51. Thus, under Apollo's care, the nanny-goats will breed at such a rate that within a short time the first group will be " protec tresses " of a flock consisting of their own offspring : for example, five nannies, if they produce twins twice a year, will within twelve months become the "guardians " or "protectresses " of a flock 50 Cf. Stephanus Byz. s.v. 'A&amp;pioc; Columella 7,6,7. 51 Some commentators take ?ou?oatov (50) as meaning " pasture " rather than " herd of cows ".</page><page sequence="17">Callimachus' Hymn to Apollo 143 numbering twenty-five. Apollo confers on the sheep and goats under his care his own attributes : he himself is a twin, and the goats bear twins52 ; he is s7U[rr?Xio?, they become sTujrqXaSs?. In conclusion, one must draw attention to the Homeric pass age which Callimachus is clearly alluding to here. In Od. 4,86 ff. Menelaus praises the fertility of the sheep of a foreign land he has visited: Tpi? Y^P t?xtsi [XTJXoc TsXscT?opov d?

(87) is recalled by Ss?oivto in Callimachus; the triple negative outs ... outs ... o?S? is echoed by ouSs ... ou&amp;s ... ouSs; YaXaxTo? as a line ending is matched by aYaXaxTs?. Where is this land of marvels which Menelaus describes in these glowing terms? None other than Libya, the hinterland of Cyrene, our poet's own native city, where this hymn is set *.
