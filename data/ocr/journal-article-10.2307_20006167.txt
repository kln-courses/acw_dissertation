Following Quine, observation sentences A and B are the same belief when they share the same stimulus meaning, similar patterns of assent and dissent by subjects when the sentences are queried in the presence of the same non-linguistic stimuli. As for non-observation sentences we note a suggestion of Karl Schick:' apply linguistic stimuli in the form of utterances of the language, and map the connections between sentences in the language in terms of linguistic conditioned-responses to utterances. The mapping will yield a network of relations between non-observation sentences themselves, and between the latter and observation sentences at the 'periphery'. Thus, each sentence receives its place in the overall criss-crossing of relations in the network of the language. Out of a commitment to the 'autonomy of meaning', we can say that when A and B are non-observational, they are the same belief when they occupy similar places in the network of sentences in a given language, or corresponding places in corresponding networks of two languages. (Since we can identify the place of sentences in the language network, and since the present suggestion identifies the sameness of belief with location identity, it turns out that there needn't be indeterminacy of translocation.)2 The same strategy seems to work, at best, for formal languages only. Consider natural languages. In them, the mapping of sentence-relationships cannot be clearly determined, there is too much vagueness and ambiguity to allow for that. Nonetheless, we could apply Schick's strategy to natural languages by saying that A and B are the same belief, nearly enough, if they occupy corresponding places in the sentence network, with shared vagueness and ambiguity. But a second, more serious, problem presents itself. The sentences of a language are in principle infinite in number, so that sentence mapping via conditioned response is inadequate to give the place of sentences in the language overall. We will never know how A and B compare in that part of the language that lies beyond. What we need is a theory of the links between the sentences we are able to test, so that we can generate an in-principle grid of connections to sentences never tested. So let us suppose I See Karl Schick, 'Indeterminacy of translation', Journal of Philosophy LXIX (I972). 2 Quine himself has come over to this position in his recent writings. See Quine, 'On empirically equivalent systems of the world', Erkenntnis (I975), 313-28.</page><page sequence="2">i6o JEROME I. GELLMAN this problem is overcome byjust such a theory. Still, a fundamental objection remains. In natural languages there is need for a concept of relative-identity of beliefs, that theories like the one considered above do not provide. In natural languages there is the phenomenon of sentences A and B corresponding to one another with regard to their place in the grid of sentences, but only for a part of that grid. Elsewhere they diverge from one another. From a desire to note the partial correspondence, we might want to say that A and B are the same belief with regard to that sub-network of language for which their respective relations to other sentences coincide. In other areas of language they will not be the same belief. In natural languages there exists a deep social/pragmatic need to make such relative distinctions. The need expresses itself when fragments of language are perceived as important for social classification, and even as the ground for such classification. Under such conditions the question of belief identity changes from a semi-formal/semi metaphysical question, to a question calling for decisions of value, reflecting the universal human trait of constructing various social categories according to pragmatic considerations of social, moral, etc. values.' The issues surrounding the thesis of relative identity of belief are well illustrated via consideration of a famous passage in Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge.2 Berkeley endorses the continued use of sentences like 'fire warms' and 'water cools', although in accordance with his philosophy it is only spirit that warms and cools, strictly speaking. In this connection Berkeley writes, 'We ought to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar'. Now Berkeley and the vulgar both say 'fire warms'. But do they have the same belief that fire warms, or is Berkeley's belief in this matter different on account of his philosophical views? This question deserves no absolute answer. Rather, the facts are that for a large fragment of their respective languages the sentence 'fire warms' occupies a corresponding place for Berkeley as for the vulgar. The relations between that sentence and others in that large fragment are preserved as we go from Berkeley's talk to the talk of the vulgar. Beyond that fragment, however, the relevant network of language diverge. Berkeley associates with that sentence whole chains of sentences that find no counterpart in ordinary talk. If our interest were to stress the possibility of living with Berkeley (you ask him whether the fire is hot enough to warm the food by lunch-time, and he answers that it is), or to express our view that he is a normal human being, not to be committed to a mental institution despite everything, we undoubtedly would want to say that he and the vulgar have the same belief. He too believes that fire warms. At the same time, being aware that he tends to say strange, surprising I For a particularly acute treatment of the theme of social classifications and their bearing on religious belief and practice, see Mary Douglas, (Purity and Danger (London: Routledge, I966). 2 Berkeley, Principles of Human Knowledge (New York: Bobbs-Merrill, I957), p. 47.</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AS LANGUAGE i6i things when he gets started on the subject, we might want to note that fact as well. The best way to do so would be to have recourse to the relative identity of belief. We would then say that Berkeley has the same (let us say) 'physical' belief as other people, but a different (let us say) 'metaphysical' belief, the 'arithmetic' of physical and metaphysical belief diverging. That Berkeley shares the same physical belief but has different metaphysical beliefs is not the conclusion of philosophical meditation on the essence of belief, but is guided by the interests to be served by giving one answer rather than another to the question: Do Berkeley and the vulgar have the same belief? In general, I propose a thesis of relative identity of belief for natural languages. A and B can be the same p-belief but distinct y-beliefs, where q) and y denote kinds of language networks within an overall language network (e.g. 'physical', 'metaphysical'). Their being the same qp-belief and distinct y-beliefs will depend on the extent, respectively, of the correspondence or lack ofit in the formal structure of sentence relations in the p- and Y-fragments. The similarity or lack of it in the roles of A and B in those fragments, as well as the very recognition of p and y4 kinds as sub-networks, and their boundaries, is not a matter of philosophical judgement, but the expression of social realities and human values. Language fragments come to be identified and socially recognized in accordance with human needs, and can change accordingly. Incidentally, the relative identity of belief relates to the job of translation. Sentence A in language L may have a dual role: being a qp-sentence as well as a y-sentenc, determined by its place in the relevant sub-networks of L. This is not ambiguity of the usual sort. For here it is not a matter of A having, as it were, two competing meanings, now one, now another. Rather it is A's having a particular location in two sub-networks simultaneously. So that any one occurrence of A expresses at the same time a particular p-belief as well as a particular y-belief. In language L', however, sentence B may be the same qp-sentence as A in L, but only C the same y-sentence as A in L. In such a case, there is no sense in asking what is the translation of A in L'. How to translate will depend on the interests of the translator and his intended audience. The translator must decide whether it's the qp-meaning or the y-meaning of A that he wants to capture. Given the thesis of the relative identity of belief, it is not always a matter of fact what the correct translation 1S. The view that belief is individuated relationally has significance for the understanding of religious language. In order to show this it will be necessary first to make two points about the way religious language, i.e. language about God, is normally learned. By attending to the process of learning, I hope to show something about the structure of that language itself. My first point about the learning of religious language is that it is a learning</page><page sequence="4">I62 JEROME I. GELLMAN by analogy. This is not meant to endorse anything like an 'analogical theory of God', but to describe the ordinary language of religious believers. Sentences about God are constructed by analogy from profane discourse. The analogy is of two sorts. First, there is the analogy that results from substituting for words in sentences in profane language. Via substitutions we pass gradually from a profane to a religious sentence, from, for example, 'Johnny took the Lego out of the drawer' to 'God took the Israelites out of Egypt'. This is an analogy of structure. Second, there is analogy of extrapolation as, for example, when God's goodness is compared to that of a person, on the analogy of a person's greatness, compared to that of a fly. Again, this is not a theology of analogy, but a description of how sentences like 'God's greatness is beyond our grasp' get into the language. In both types of analogy, what gets learned are individual sentences, each of them holding some analogical relation to sentences outside the language of religion.' But individual sentences are only the starting points of the language. What must be learned is the extent to which the analogy can be carried between religious and profane discourse, and this requires learning chains of sentences, networks of discourse, which in their structure and degree of resemblance to profane networks, embody the nature and limits of the analogy between God and persons, say, in the ordinary talk of religious believers. It must be learned, for example, that He hears our prayers, but that we need not raise our voice to make sure He hears; that He sees our every action, but has no eyes; that He examines our hearts, without need of stethoscope. By learning what does and what does not follow from individual sentences, constructed analogically, the analogy comes to attach to sentence-networks rather than to individual sentences only. Now to my second point about the learning of religious language. The structure of religious language, embodying the analogical networks of sentences to such networks in profane discourse, is learned institutionally. That is to say, the believer comes to know the limits of the analogy in language structures, within the institutional life of a religion, primarily in its rituals. In what is said in and around rituals, and in how the rituals are performed, he comes to acquire a system of discourse about God. It is by taking part in prayer, for example, that he learns that 'God hears our prayers' does not imply the need to raise one's voice. When told on Yom Kippur that 'God examines his heart' he comes to know some of what that implies and does not imply by participating in the service of that day. In consequence, the language of religion becomes shared as an institutional, social language, informing the institutional life of a religious association. A circle is drawn, as it were, around certain networks of language, which receive social/institutional legitimacy. Adherents of a religion are recognized 1 Compare Quine on the learning of theoretical concepts, Word and Object (Cambridge, Mass.: M.I.T. 1960), section 4.</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION AS LANGUAGE I63 by their practice of the rituals of a religion, and their employment of the language used in the religion's institutional settings. And now for the link-up to the thesis of relative identity of belief. Consider two people, S and S', both of whom say 'God exists'. This last sentence may express for both S and S' the same religious belief, yet different metaphysical beliefs. They will have the same religious belief, when for each of them 'God exists' occupies a similar position in the analogical sentence networks about God that are part of the institutional life of a particular religion or religious tradition to which they adhere. The religious concept of God is embodied in just such language. At the very same time, the belief of S and S' that God exists can be, for each of them, a different metaphysical belief. The idiosyncratic interpretations of their belief, that is, the networks of sentences 'God exists' generates for each of them outside the institutional religious language, pertains to their metaphysics. I am proposing, therefore, a social demarcation between metaphysics and religion, rather than one of subject matter. Any metaphysical belief could be a religious one, depending upon where the institutional lines are drawn. These latter, rather than the 'essence' of metaphysics and religion are what count. For my initial concept of' religion' I simply start with the prototypical religions known to me, and demarcate them from metaphysics on empirical grounds. Religious beliefs exist in an institutional web, metaphysical ones do not. Here, indeed, is a weakness of metaphysics, and a source of incommensur ability between metaphysical systems. In general, metaphysical systems do not have a crystallized social status, and it is therefore difficult to determine the degree of identity of similarity between two metaphysical sentences or sentence fragments. Not being embedded in institutional forms, it is difficult to determine hardened networks of relations between sentences, and equally difficult to find the limits of linguistic analogy of metaphysical talk. In principle, there need be no determining relation between one's religious beliefs and one's metaphysics. The history of Jewish religious thought, for example, reveals metaphysical views of God going all the way from anthropomorphism to Aristotelianism, from theism to panentheism and pantheism. None the less, in practice religious language exerts influence over the metaphysics of its adherents, for at least three reasons. (i) There is a sociological tendency for metaphysical disputes to become hardened into institutional allegiances; (2) There is the 'bewitchment of language'. Religious language has the form of talk about (a) a being, (b) distinct from the world. (These features are what allow it to be learned analogically from profane discourse.) Hence, there will be a natural resistance to views like pantheism or panentheism, (3) Religious belief is total and all-encompassing: the believer is enjoined to love God with all his heart, all his soul, and all his might. This means the application of religious discourse as far as possible 6 RES 2I</page><page sequence="6">I64 JEROME I. GELLMAN to every aspect of life. Hence, in general, there will be a natural resistance to metaphysical reductions that the religious masses cannot perceive as an at least isomorphic explication of each element of religious discourse, and hence an abandonment of that discourse. In practice, therefore, religion influences metaphysics. Wittgenstein has put it this way: Dogma is expressed in the form of an assertion, and is unshakable, but at the same time any practical opinion can be made to harmonize with it: admittedly more easily in some cases than in others. It is not a wall setting limits to what can be believed, but more like a brake... it's almost as though someone were to attach a weight to your foot to restrict your freedom of movement.1 The above observations on the relative identity of belief and its application to religion can aid us in addressing the issue of the individuating principles of religions. Recently De Haven and King-Farlow have cited grounds for doubting the usefulness of present-day denominational demarcations.2 They envision the ordering of the religious beliefs of individual believers on a scale of internationality versus externality, in a borrowing from Quine's 'Two dogmas of empiricism'. These 'orderings' will portray which of his religious beliefs the believer is the most and least willing to give up for purposes of internal consistency, and in light of fresh knowledge and insights concerning human nature, man's place in the world, etc. The more 'internal' a belief, the more immune to change. De Haven and King-Farlow suggest that these orderings might be discovered to 'cut so remarkably far and so often across titular groups ofJews and Christians ... that the usefulness of drawing distinctions between faiths by popular titles and official texts is even more curiously limited ... than we have dared to suppose.3 In opposition to De Haven and King-Farlow, I believe that the orderings of individuals' beliefs need not be at all relevant to denominational demarca tions. Religious affiliation imposes first and foremost a form of expression for one's metaphysical views, suited for the religious life. Individuals differing widely over the orderings of their beliefs may agree to see supreme value in expressing their respective idiosyncratic orderings in the idiom of one religion. They may be of one mind in their loyalty to one set of texts, one set of stories, one idiom in confronting life. The value they place on an institutional language means they share a set of religious beliefs. Their common recognition of value in the institutional idiom may be mere sentimentality, but need not be. The common language of a religious community may express for its members their common hopes, collective historical memories, and ways of confronting their daily lives. It may be said 1 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Culture and Value (Oxford: Blackwell, 1980), p. 28e. 2 Steven De Haven and John King-Farlow, 'Metaphilosophy and religious disagreements', Nods (I979), 5I i-i6. 3 De Haven and King-Farlow, p. 514.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION AS LANGUAGE I65 that their institutional language constitutes these hopes and memories for them. Religious affiliation is based on a commitment to a certain intersection of personal orderings, expressed in a shared language that the believer cherishes above all alternatives. This is not to say that from the point of view of the religious establishment all orderings will be tolerated. Here is a possible source of tension between the individual's accepting, and others' acceptance of him. But there is in fact much latitude for personal orderings. The situation is somewhat similar to the classical puzzle over the perception of colours. How can I know, goes the question, that what I call 'red' is what others call 'red'? So how can I know that we all 'mean the same thing' by 'red'? The answer is that the 'meaning' or 'red' does not depend on an identity of phenomena, but on an identity of the role of ' red' in shared language. If we use 'red' on similar occasions of observations (independently determined), and sentence networks with 'red' in them are sufficiently similar, then we share the same concept of 'red'. Alternatively, we can say that 'identity of phenomena' is identity of the relevant language. As Max Black has put it, 'The phenomena cancel out'. Here, too, the personal orderings of individual believers tend to 'cancel out' in the face of their shared religious belief, i.e. their shared institutional language. Metaphysical belief is not individuating for religion, and neither is ritual. A while back I claimed that religious discourse was learned primarily in the vicinity of ritual, but this ritual - at least in its non-linguistic aspects - does not afford identity conditions for religion. Religious language can take on a life of its own apart from the non-linguistic aspects of ritual in which it originally finds a home, and the identity conditions for religious belief are to be sought just in that language, prescinded from ritual context. That non-linguistic ritual does not contribute to individuation is seen from at least two considerations. First, there is the phenomenon of the backslider, who remains in the framework of a religion, even though he no longer observes its rituals. His use of the idiom - the stories, the categories of language of everyday life, etc. of the religion identify him as a believer. On the other hand, it is unthinkable that a person who performs the non-linguistic aspects of ritual in the total absence of any use whatever of religious language, should be considered a religious believer. This brings us to the second point. The criterion of identity for non-linguistic ritual acts is rooted in the identity of the language surrounding it. Similar physical movements in similar physical settings do not constitute 'the same ritual' unless they are related to a language which is deemed the same. The believer's conduct in ritual is to be understood in terms of his religious language. The latter is internally related to the former. Studies of ancient Greek religion have shown that in ancient times the Greeks performed certain standard rituals in their temples, yet the explana 6-2</page><page sequence="8">i66 JEROME I. GELLMAN tions they themselves gave of those rituals were diverse and even mutually contradictory. The explanations were not really important, and this might be thought to counter my claim above that ritual is individuated by language. But what makes Greek temple practises even loosely the same religion is the fact that the ritual and the explanations both occur in the context of shared mythology, stories about the gods forming the institutional language in light of which the rituals are performed and explanations offered. In short, we may say that the Greeks had no dogma, but plenty of shared language nonetheless. The common denominator of a religion is the stories told, the prayers prayed, and the common language of saint and sinner alike. Their commonality is subject to thejudgement of the believers themselves, deciding when the similarity is sufficient and what relative weight various elements in the language carry. Does that mean that religious individuation is subject to the mere whims of a religious community? Not necessarily. One is always free to provide a metaphysical meta-sociological theory of how one's religious community makes such judgements. One may, for example, see the 'spirit of tne believers' as expressing an overall divine plan for guiding one's religion on the right path. The point is that the thesis of relative identity of belief applied to religion, in itself requires no particular stance on the value of institutional belief, or lack of it. The relative identity of belief can help us gain a new perspective on theological problems. I will restrict myself here to a discussion of the problem of evil, by which I mean the apparent contradiction between the existence of evil and the existence of an all-good, all-powerful and all-knowing God. There is a different problem of evil with which I will not be concerned, and it is an ontological problem, namely: to explain the very possibility of the existence of evil, when it is metaphysically dependent upon an absolutely perfect being. How is the very being of evil possible? This second problem is independent of the first. The first may be solved, for example, by giving a convincing reason for God allowing evil, yet leave us still wondering how there can be any metaphysical dependence of evil on God. Conversely, the second may be solved, e.g. via the evil-is-privation route, yet fail to solve the first problem, by not showing that God could have a reason for allowing evil. The problem of evil is, of course, a very old problem to Judaism and to Christianity. But it is more than that. It is internal to those faith-communities. That is to say, it is a problem recognized and dealt with in the Bible, part of the credal base of those religions. As such, it is an authorized problem. The believer is required to believe that the problem of evil is a real problem. This shapes his understanding of what it means to say that God is good, knowing and powerful. In contrast, the problem of God's foreknowledge and human freedom, for example, is not an internal problem, but arises when religious thinkers reflect upon their authorized traditions. As such, a believer</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION AS LANGUAGE I67 is not required to believe that it is a real problem at all. If it exists at all, it is an external problem.1 I once argued, on the basis of the above distinction between internal and external problems, that no theological understanding of God and evil could at one and the same time (a) have the result that the problem of evil could not arise, and (b) be an authentic articulation of the Judaic-Christian tradition.2 My reasoning was that the problem of evil is internal to that tradition hence within that tradition the concepts of God and evil could not be so articulated so that the problem could never arise. On that basis I argued for the superiority of an analogical theory of God over a thoroughgoing via negativa, on the grounds that the former, but not the latter, makes the problem of evil possible. In light of the thesis of relative-identity of belief, however, the above line of reasoning is seen to be mistaken. The problem of evil is indeed an authorized problem in the Judaic-Christian tradition. The believer must believe that it is a problem. But here we must distinguish between a religious belief in the seriousness of the problem, and a metaphysical belief to the same effect. To say the problem is authorized is only to say that it is part of religious language to speak of evil as posing a problem for God's justice. Such ways of speaking are part of the shared network of language of an institutional religion. The status of the problem of evil, therefore, is akin to the status of sentences like 'God descended on Mt. Sinai' and 'God sees our every action'. They are part of a system of language the use of which identifies a religion. Likewise, to have a religious belief in the seriousness of the problem of evil just is to engage in the use of a shared institutional language in which it appears. To have a metaphysical belief in the seriousness of the problem of evil, on the other hand, is to believe that the problem arises within one's theological system. Of course, one may have the religious belief in the problem of evil, without the corresponding metaphysical belief. For the problem of evil can have religious significance even if it is not a metaphysical problem at all, just as anthropomorphic religious language can be religiously significant in the absence of any metaphysical analogue. To suggest one possible line of religious significance for the problem of evil, it might be that by employing the language of the problem of evil in the religious life the believer is taught to relate to the world's evils with utter seriousness, to always be aware of evil and to compromise with it in any form, or extent. The battle against evil is waged for God's sake, since God said of the world that 'it was good'. All of this is perfectly consistent with a solution to the metaphysical problem of evil, that is, to there being no problem of evil in one's I For a more detailed presentation of the distinction between internal and external problems see J. Gellman, 'The meta-philosophy of religious language', Nods (I977), I5 i-6i. 2 See Gellman, op. cit.</page><page sequence="10">i68 JEROME I. GELLMAN metaphysical articulation of the concept of God. What binds believers together is their religious belief in the problem of evil, not their metaphysical beliefs. So, from the metaphysical point of view it may not be a problem for an individual believer. And from a religious point of view there is nothing to be solved, except what is solved by living the religious life in utter seriousness.' ' I am indebted to J. J.
