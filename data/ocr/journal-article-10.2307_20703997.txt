<plain_text><page sequence="1">192 FIGURINES AND OTHER STONES OF POWER AMONG THE KYAKA OF CENTRAL NEW GUINEA By RALPH and SUSAN BULMER1 "Prehistoric" stone artefacts?pestles, mortars, elubheads and figurines, made by techniques not known locally at the time of first European contact?have been reported from many parts of the Territory of Papua-New Guinea.2 This paper firstly discusses the contemporary uses and classification of such stones among the Kyaka (eastern Enga) people who live on the northern slopes and foothills of Mount H?gen, between the Baiyer and Lai Rivers,3 and secondly describes the nine figurines which were obtained by the authors during their fieldwork in this area. These include two full length human figures and two heads which are, we believe, the first human representations in stone from the Central Highlands Districts to be described in publication. The other five figurines are birds or fragments of birds. Our Kyaka collections also include 33 mortars, 7 pestles, and 100 elubheads and other perforated stones, or fragments of these. We hope to describe some of these in a later publication, and also to discuss the classification and distribution of stone cults in the Highlands. 1?Magico-Religious Uses of Stone Among the Kyaka At first European contact, in 1933, the Kyaka were using natural stones or stone artefacts for a number of practical, every-day purposes: as axe-blades; for grindstones and rubbers; as unworked flakes for scraping and cutting; as pounders for cracking nuts; pumice or pumice like stone for scouring; certain soft stones for talc when spinning 1 R.B. spent thirteen months in 1955-56 and four months in 1959-60 doing social anthropological fieldwork among the Kyaka, the first period as a Research Scholar of the Australian National University and the second in the course of an Auckland University project supported by the American Philosophical Society, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the Carnegie Social Science Fund (New Zealand). S.B. spent four months in the Baiyer River region in 1959 while engaged in an archaeological survey of parts of the Eastern and Western Highland Districts, supported by the American Museum of Natural History. We should like to acknowledge our gratitude to all the institutions which helped finance our research, and also, particu larly, to Dr. H. L. Shapiro for his personal encouragement of S.B.'s project. S.B. also wishes to thank the Polynesian Society for a grant to defray her photographic expenses. We are also very grateful to Mr. V. Paral of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National Uni versity and Mr. W. Ambrose of the Anthropology Department, University of Auckland, for photographing our specimens. 2 Berndt 1954 describes a number of artefacts and also (p. 554) lists some important earlier publications describing specimens from the High lands. Other examples are given by Aufenanger 1960, Casey 1939, H?ltker 1951, Nilles 1953, van Stijn 1953, Williams 1940:30 and Wirz 1951. 3 For locations of the Enga groups see Meggitt 1958:256-63, and for further information on the Kyaka see Bulmer 1960.

Today stone-bladed axes have been replaced entirely by steel, though in 1959 we purchased one stone axe said to have been used within the last few months for splitting firewood. Similarly knives and other tools of iron and steel have completely replaced stone flakes for cutting and scraping. The other traditional practical uses of stone remain. Until about 1950, when missionary influence among the Kyaka began to take effect, stone objects were also used extensively for magico religious purposes. Such uses continue today, but on a much reduced scale. By 1955 it was possible to purchase large numbers of magical and cult stones from Kyaka who were adopting Christianity. However, although Mission activity greatly facilitated our collecting, it also made some aspects of our enquiry extremely difficult. Such performances of traditional religious and magical activities as continue are carefully concealed, both from Europeans and from many Christian Kyaka, and in fact we witnessed very little indeed of these. The account that follows is necessarily based on informants' statements and not on direct observation. Some informants gave demonstrations but these were necessarily incomplete since any but the most trivial religious and magical performances require the sacrifice of pigs and the participation of other actors in appropriate social relationships. Both natural stones and artefacts are used in magical and religious activities. The natural stones include smooth rounded stones, many of them water-worn and some stated by their owners to have been taken from water-courses, and stones of unusual colour, texture or shape, such as quartz crystals, stalactites and fossils. The artefacts include mortars or dishes, or fragments of these, those in our collections rang ing in size from 4J to 13 ins. diameter and in weight from 1 to 28 lbs., as well as figurines, pestles, elubheads and other perforated stones or their fragments, the smallest of which are broken pieces only about an inch and a half long. There are also a number of round stones, showing signs of use as pounders, which may in some cases be artefacts. Not all the objects we collected were said to have been used for magico-religious purposes; of those that were, some were said to have been used for generations past. Others had been in people's personal possession for a long time but no information was forthcoming as to their actual use. Yet others had been only recently discovered, generally during garden making, some while we were in the field. R.B. found one broken mortar in a newly made garden, and a broken unfinished clubhead was found at a trackside, in his presence, apparently rooted up by a pig. Present-day Kyaka do not know how or when most of these stones were made. Some of the perforated stone discs are of soft easily-shaped material and one of those sold to us was in fact said to have been made by the father of the vendor. Most of the artefacts, however, are made from hard tuffs, andesites and basalts by pecking and grinding tech niques not used by contemporary Kyaka, though grinding by itself is of course used by them in finishing and resharpening axe-blades. Further, although many of the elubheads are of types which were in recent post European use as weapons in some other parts of New Guinea, the</page><page sequence="3">194 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Kyaka have no knowledge of their hafting and function as weapons.4 Similarly, although some of the mortars show signs of wear, the Kyaka made no practical use of them, in spite of the fact that they use natural stones to crack Elaeocarpus nuts, the kernels of which are eaten.5 Kyaka do not discriminate between the smaller artefacts (figurines, pestles, and fragments of clubheads) and fossils and other natural stones of curious shape, which they use for identical purposes. Several prospective vendors were annoyed by our refusal to pay the same price for fossils as we did for figurines. Kyaka do not categorise these stones as 'mortars', 'clubheads', 'pestles', etc., though they can of course describe the various shapes which occur: our interpreter, explaining to men in a settlement which we had not previously visited what kinds of stones we were interested in, caused amusement by announcing that we particularly wanted those with faces (i.e. figurines) or anuses (i.e. clubheads and other perforated stones).0 Kyaka classification is mainly based on use, or assumed use, or on mythological provenance; though there are special terms for quartz crystals, for flint or flint-like stones, and for certain other notable formations. Thus it is impossible on shape and appearance alone to classify the stones in Kyaka categories, since on these bases many stones could fall in several classes. Only the owners can tell what they were used for and what origins are attributed to them; but the owners are in practice often unwilling to do so, especially, it seems, in the case of sorcery stones. Other people are often prepared to hazard guesses, but these only provide indications as to which categories the specimens could fall into, and no more. Stones are used in ghost and ancestor cults and, notably, in the cult of the Enda semangko ('woman-ghost' or 'goddess'); for sorcery; for luck-magic; and for divining. We may for convenience restrict the term 'fertility stones' to stones used in the ghost and ancestor cults, and the goddess cult, though it would be equally proper to call some of the stones used in luck magic by the same title. Almost every occasion on which domestic pigs (other than diseased or stolen ones) are killed and cooked is a sacrifice to the ghosts. Before 4 Berndt notes that the Fore and other people of the Eastern Highlands also had no knowledge of the use of clubheads as weapons in spite of their relative proximity to the Kukukuku who still manufacture these. (Berndt 1954:570.) 5 The nearest approximation to 'practical' use for mortars reported in the Highlands is the Kutubu practice of pounding vegetable medicines in them for cult purposes (Williams 1940:148). 6 Meggitt (1956 :116) reports cult stones among the Waka Enga which represent a vulva and a penis, though these are not, it seems, artefacts. He also notes (Meggitt 1956:116) that Central Enga interpret natural stones and artefacts used in fertility cults as sweet potatoes, yams and parts of human or pig anatomy (Meggitt 1961a). Berndt reports that a pestle collected from the Kamano of the Eastern Highlands may be identified as a penis and that Fore informants suggested that pestles and mortars were used in fertility cults because of their likeness to human genitalia (Berndt 1954:566, 571n.). We have no explicit statements of this kind from Kyaka informants, although some said that certain stones were 'male' and others 'female*.</page><page sequence="4">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 195 a pig is slaughtered the man who is supervising the cooking (usually the owner of the pig, though this may belong to a member of his domestic groups) holds its tethering rope and addresses a particular ghost or particular ghosts, presenting it to them. The pig is then clubbed to death and immediately singed over an open fire. The ghosts are believed to receive the aroma of the singeing as their portion. Some informants say that the ghosts also consume the moisture and liquid grease of the pork which is lost later in the earth-oven. The ghosts primarily concerned are those of recently deceased kinsfolk, most frequently the fathers of the men making the sacrifices. On certain occasions cult stones are also used. Those we have been shown are mortars, figurines (notably the two large human figures described below, though some men say that the small bird and human head figures were also used in this way), and smooth round or oval black stones of three to nine inches in diameter. These stones are associated not with the ghosts of the recent dead but with more distant ancestors, sometimes the eponymous founders of the subclans and clans. At the time of the pig-cooking they are decorated with ochre and smeared with the blood and grease of the pigs. Spells or invocations (pipu) are said over the stones and they are placed on top of the oven pits in which the pork is being cooked: we do not know whether this is outside the oven, or inside the top coverings of banana foliage and earth. The previous owner of figurine S2, which is associated with the ancestor of Kunyengga clan, explained that by decorating and smearing this and other stones, they could "talk" to the ancestor. The actions ensured that the clansmen would grow strong, and that children and pigs would not die or be sickly. Vendors of other stones similarly used said that the main object of these performances were not to promote the well-being of whole descent groups but merely to ensure the fertility of the particular family's pigs. One informant said that the stones might be greased in an attempt to ensure that a pregnant woman would have a male child. Another informant mentioned the treatment of stones in this way to obtain hunting luck on a forthcoming expedition into the forest. It seems that stones used in these family and descent group cults have generally been passed down from father to son. Figurine 147, illustrated below, was said to have belonged to Kae, the founding ancestor of the subsubclan (of Roepo Wapisuk clan) of that name, and was given us by Kunje, a putative great-grandson. At the same time, men who find mortars and other suitable stones in their gardens and elsewhere generally retain these, and it is most likely that in time some of them become incorporated in the cults. Mortars, figurines and smooth natural stones (in some cases, apparently, the same pieces as are used in the family and descent group pig sacrifices) are also key objects in the Enda semcmgko ('Woman ghost' or 'Goddess') cult. This is the cult known to the Central Metlpa as Kor nganap and described in detail by Vicedom.7 Several Kyaka clans living east of the River Lanim adopted this cult from the Metlpa in the late 1940's and early 1950's, well after first European contact. Only two 7 Vicedom and Tischner 1943, 11:423-51.</page><page sequence="5">196 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY Kyaka clans have completed the cycle, which takes several years, and it is now probable that the remainder will never do so, because of Misionary influence. This very spectacular cult, in the course of which hundreds of pigs are sacrificed, is said by both Kyaka and Metlpa informants to bring the clans who perform it fertility and health for humans and pigs, success in war, and success in the Moka ceremonial exchange festivals. Some Kyaka informants add that it protects men against the malice or insubordination of their wives, the Goddess being particularly concerned to punish women who harm their husbands with menstrual pollution. Elaborate cult grounds with a large public cere monial arena and a series of private enclosures are built, and during periods of cult activity the stones are kept in one or two houses within the innermost sanctum, where only the cult leaders see and handle them. As in the smaller-scale ghost- and ancestor-cults, the stones are decorated with ochre and smeared with blood and grease. The cult invokes both the ancestors of the clan and the Goddess, who is said to be married to the men of the clan for the period of the cycle. One particular stone represents the Goddess. Some informants say that this is a figurine or statue, others that it is a large unfeatured stone, perhaps two feet high.8 Luluai (Headman) Sipunyi of Roepo Wapisuk clan, who inaugu rated the cult at Yaramanda in about 1950, explained to us how the stones were assembled. It had begun when some of his clansmen came and told him that they had had a dream in which a beautiful young woman, the Goddess, appeared in a certain place. Then, when one day he was sitting on his personal ceremonial ground he suddenly saw, out side his house, three large stones. He conferred with an exchange partner in the Ramui clan, which had already performed the cult cycle, and this man confirmed that these were the stones of the Goddess. Sipunyi then hid these stones by burying them, but when he had done so three more appeared on his ceremonial ground. Sipunyi told his followers and the other important men of the clan. They made the initial small cult-ground with a house on it, and together they assembled about thirty stones. Some were stones they had possessed all along and had kept hidden in their men's houses, or buried in the ground; others just appeared outside the houses, or were other wise discovered after dreams had indicated where they would appear; others were purchased from men of other clans; and several they stole. One important man, renowned for his aggressive behaviour in war and 8 Vicedom and Tischner say that all the Mbwamb cult stones they have seen are natural ones, artefacts only being employed in magic (Vicedom and Tischner 1943, 11:449). However, they describe the Ndika tribe's cult stones (ibid.: 432), noting that the two most important ones, representing the Kor Nganap ('Goddess') and Kor Wop (a male spirit) are hyperboloid in shape, with a narrow depression at the top (i.e. shaped like pedestal-based mortars). Mr. J. S. Coltheart of Auckland has shown us a photograph of cult stones taken by a Seventh Day Adventist missionary, probably north east of Mt. H?gen Government Station. These stones include mortars. We were told by Rui, an Ugini Metlpa youth who worked for us, that the Ugini Goddess is represented by a stone human figure standing as high as a man's knee.</page><page sequence="6">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 197 peace, went off and stole a mortar said to have been as big as a five gallon kerosene drum. Sipunyi's exchange partners in the Ramui clan instructed the local men in the appropriate rites, and would, at the culmination of the cycle, receive payment for their services. Pigs were sacrificed and the stones decorated and annointed. They were then buried in concealed places until such time as the next phase of the cycle would commence. As noted above, the cult is now in abeyance, with the stones remaining hidden. There was some excitement at Yaramanda in 1955 when it was discovered that a pig had entered the cult ground and rooted up the soil round the base of a clump of bamboo where some of the mortars had been buried, and these had disappeared. The Luluai suggested that someone, possibly our Wahgi-Valley servant, had stolen them to sell them to us. However, when he examined the mortars we had purchased, he could not identify any as originating from his cult-ground. Our information on the Goddess cult among the Kyaka is very incomplete. It does not appear that each fertility stone represents one particular member of the clan, living or dead, as Vicedom and Tischner report to be the case among the Metlpa.9 Rather, each participant brought in such stones as he could assemble, some of them associated with specific named ancestors, while others were just generally associ ated with the ghosts and believed on this basis to be vehicles of supernatural power. By 1959 little value was set by many Kyaka on chance-found mortars of unknown provenance, though most men still valued highly those stones they had inherited as heirlooms. We were distressed to find that one nicely fashioned mortar, which the possessor wrongly believed us not to want to purchase, had been smashed up and the broken fragments used as cooking stones. We were told that stones were also used in the cult of the ghosts of previous owners of garden land, in which possums and rats are sacrificed when the gardens are newly made, but we were not shown any of these. Some were described to us as large rounded stones. Stones are also the agents of the most powerful form of sorcery known to the Kyaka. As described to us, these are generally fairly small stones, either figurines or natural stones of curious shape, or, possibly, clubheads or fragments of clubheads. The only example we have seen which was explicitly stated by the vendor to be in this category was the bird figurine (18), described below, though the owner said he had never used it himself. This stone was also used, he said, to cure severe sickness, by being rubbed on the patient's skin.10 Informants are today generally reluctant to admit possession of such stones, and it may well be that other stones sold to us had in fact !) Vicedom and Tischner 1943, 11:432. 10 cf. Vicedom and Tischner 1943, 1:132; 11:381, 392. On present evidence this kind of stone sorcery appears to be restricted to the Metlpa, Kyaka, Ipili (Meggitt 1957:49), and Central Enga (Meggitt, ibid.), among the last of whom however it is not a very significant practice.</page><page sequence="7">198 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY been used for sorcery. Sorcery stones were very highly valued and were normally only held, it is said, by rich and important men. There was perhaps an element of necessity in this restriction, since a pig had to be killed and cooked each time a stone was used, and rich, important men would be in a much better position to find the requisite beast. As with the fertility stones discussed above, a sorcery stone was decorated with ochre and smeared with pig's blood and grease. Spells or invocations were said over it, and it was placed on top of the earth oven containing the pork. One informant said that he placed his stone on a small platform over the earth-oven, where the steam and aroma of the cooking meat would touch it, thus pleasing the ghost or spirit within the stone. The stone was then mounted or hafted on a cassowary quill or on rakali twigs, which are thin and flexible and used in mount ing bird-of-paradise plumes in dancing regalia. The sorcerer hid him self in grass or bushes near where his victim would pass and then, when the latter approached, would wave the stone in his or her direction, hold ing it out to one side of his body while he did so. Vigorous movement of the stone could kill the victim within a few hours; more gentle move ment would cause a slower death. Apart from the man who sold figurine (18) to us, one other gener ally reliable informant admitted having owned a sorcery stone, which he had been given by his mother's brother. He did not say that he personally had used it, but said that a wife's brother and a sister's husband had both on different occasions borrowed it from him and had killed, respectively, two boys and a girl, and a woman and a boy, with it. For the first of these loans they had given him an axe, and for the second a pearl-shell and a head-band of Nassa shells. Later, while he was away at Mt, H?gen Government Station, a matrilateral cross cousin had persuaded his wife to let him have the stone, and he had since refused to return it. For this reason, informant said, he was unable to show it to us: and in any case he thought that now they had heard the teaching of the Government and the Mission the stone should be destroyed or handed over. If the cousin did not do so, he would consider taking action against him at the Policeman's court. The owner of figurine (18) described this as a 'male' stone, in contrast to a knobbed clubhead (S7) presented to us by the Rev. K. Osborne of the Australian Baptist Mission, which he said was 'female'. He said that both male and female sorcery stones could kill. Kyaka distinguish the lethal sickness resulting from the form of stone sorcery here described from other very frequently occurring illnesses which they attribute to 'stones' projected into the body either by nature-demons (kilyakai) or by malicious human beings. Lumps, swellings, aches, and even general feelings of lassitude, are very often attributed to such agencies. We found it hard to grasp quite how men conceived that the stones were projected into their bodies, informants merely explaining that they were 'thrown' there. Some at least believed that the sorcerer physically threw a stone in the direction of the victim,</page><page sequence="8">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 199 though not, apparently, that this actually penetrated or even touched him.11 Some informants said in 1955 that this 'stone-throwing' had become much more prevalent since the arrival of Europeans had brought peace to the region and had prevented the settlement of disputes by physical violence, in spite of the fact that many men had discarded their stones on account of mission teaching. Both forms of stone sorcery, like poisoning with which they are categorised by Kyaka under the general term mauli, are stated emphatically only to be employed against members of other, hostile clans, and never by one clansman against another. They are used, or believed to be used, as an alternative to direct physical violence when for some reason this is impracticable, on account for example of the support the potential victim can muster, or of the physical distance of his settlement rendering military action difficult. Although only a few men admit to the possession of sorcery stones nearly all Kyaka men, and some women, formerly possessed kits of small stones used for divining and for luck-magic. Single stones or kits of several stones were generally kept wrapped up in greasy bundles of bark-cloth, which often also contained small mammal, snake or eel bones, feathers, fragments of insects, and other magical apparatus. The bundles are kept in the owners' houses. The great majority of those stones which we have seen are not artefacts. They include many small smooth black or red stones, while fossils or fragments of fossils, quartz crystals and stalactitic stones were also recorded. However, many of the clubheads and rings (entire or broken) in our collection, several small artificially grooved or indented pebbles, and most of our pestles and small figurines, are also in this category. One kit we collected included a metal bolt and another a rough piece of opaque white glass of European manufacture. Some of these stones, including many of the clubheads and rings, some of the pestles and figurines, and several of the plain smooth stones and quartz crystals, have string tied to them, often attached by means of a thin band of plaited orchid-fibre bound tightly round the object. In some cases the strings of two or three objects are tied together. Many of the objects with string attached are used as pendulums, for divination, mainly to discover the whereabouts of stolen or strayed livestock or lost or stolen objects. One informant said that this means of divination might be used to discover which ghost was causing a person to be ill, and how many pigs he desired as a propitiation: normally however, this kind of question is settled by other kinds of divination and particularly by the 'arrow-test'.12 The pendulum-stone moves in such a way that simple questions are answered, moving in an agitated fashion to indicate the affirmative, or swinging in the direction of the missing object. Some men say that a 11 Vicedom and Tischner (1943, I: 131, II: 392) note a comparable belief among the Metlpa and describe stones used for this purpose as smooth, black and egg-shaped. We were offered stones conforming to this description but were not told that they were sorcery stones. 32 See Meggitt 1956:131-2.</page><page sequence="9">200 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY ghost moves the pendulum: others deny this, saying that the stone moves of its own accord. Spells are said over divining stones when they are used and, in some cases at least, they are decorated with charcoal and greased with pig-fat. One informant said that divining actually took place with the stone dangled over the earth-oven in which pork was cooking. The second use for these personal kits of stones is in luck-magic, particularly to make pigs flourish, to ensure successful exchange trans actions, and to bring good fortune on an intended journey?i.e. personal safety and the receipt of valuable gifts. Such stones are also decorated and greased and have spells said over them. A man may rub his stone or stones against his skin when making journey-magic, and rub them on his pigs' backs when making pig magic. Some men own elaborate sets of stones, different ones having different purposes: others say that the same stone or stones were used for divining and for certain kinds of magic. It seems that these stones, unlike the fertility and sorcery stones, are not believed to have indwelling ghosts or spirits, but merely to have been 'marked' by the ghosts.13 Most of the divining and magical stones which we acquired had been obtained by the sellers from their fathers or other close relatives. One of the small perforated rings of soft stone was said to have been made by the seller's father. Judging by the willingness with which most men sold us individual stones or whole kits for quite small sums of money (3d to 1/6) or bartered them for inexpensive objects, no great value is set on them. This may reflect the extent to which their use has been abandoned on account of Mission teaching. Substantial pay ments, however, was generally demanded for the mortars and other large fertility stones, and the only sorcery stone we obtained from its avowed owner was also highly valued by him. Lastly we may note the magical technique for curing stone-sickness (that is, sickness caused by 'stones 'within the body, not by the stone waving sorcery, or even, necessarily, by the stone-throwing sorcery).14 Six informants dictated spells used for this purpose, though only one of these said that his spell was accompanied by rites using stones. This man gave a demonstration of part of the performance. He took about ten large leaves of the kyanggali bush (Piper sp.), making a mat roughly one foot in diameter, and placed on them about eight pieces of rough stone, from one to three inches long, of the type used as cooking stones. He held the leaves and the stones over the patient's head and recited a spell. The sense of this spell was to banish the internal sick ness-stone, exhorting it to go and damage a cassowary instead, sending 13 Vicedom and Tischner say that similar magical stones among the Mbowamb derive their power from their curious shape and from their association with previous owners, now dead, and also that perforated stones represent the hole in the rock which is the mythological entrance to the underworld whence wealth originally came (Vicedom and Tischner 1943, 11:391). We have no record of this last explanation or the associated myth among the Kyaka. 14 The Rev. E. Kelly reports that an informant from Kalepongka census village told him that kula kana stones (see below) were rubbed on the skin as a remedy for stone sorcery. (Kelly 1961.)</page><page sequence="10">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 201 it away to the place where the two rivers rush together (i.e. the con fluence of the Baiyer and the Lai rivers, where there are many casso wary in the forest). The informant said that in a proper performance a pig would be killed and cooked and the liver and kidneys would also be placed on the patient's head (unfortunately we did not enquire if the stones would be heated up with the liver and kidneys, or if the whole assemblage of offal plus stones would be placed on the patient's head together). The liver and kidneys would then be taken away and hidden, sometimes, though not always, on a burial ground: as they cooled the sickness would leave the patient. The stones were rubbed on the patient's arms, shoulders and chest, and the stones and Piper leaves were placed in a banana leaf of water. Later the patient would hide the stones in a pool of water, and take them out to rub his skin again with them if sickness returned. 2?Kyaka Terminology15 The most usual Kyaka word for a stone is kana, which is applied both to pieces of stone of any kind and to rocks, stone cliffs, and rock shelters. The word for 'moon' is also kana. Awiye is a rather less used synonym for kana in its meaning of 'stone', but not for the 'moon' homonym: it is apparently most frequently used in reference to rock shelters and to cooking-stones. Another still less often used synonym is malipwe, which, informants stated, could be used for any kind of stone or rock but which most frequently carried the connotation of 'sorcery stone', though we have also heard divining stones referred to by this term. Stones used in ancestor cults and in the cult of the Goddess are sometimes referred to as imbw?nda kana, imbw?nda ongko kana, or imbw?nda kongko kana. Imbw?nda can refer to a cult ground of the Goddess. However, it is applied particularly to certain present or past cult places, where, according to a myth recounted to us by Roepo Lengke of Yaramanda,16 an unnamed culture-hero in the distant past (Lengke could not say whether he was a Kyaka or not)17 camped during a journey across present Kyaka territory from west to east. Subsequently numbers of stones of great power were discovered at each of these camping places. His final resting place was near Kamensipa in Ramui clan territory, where one of his bones (said to be a long-bone) is still preserved, and is the focus of a cult, peculiar to the Ramui and related clans of Mapowa great-clan, known as the Akali Semangko ('Man 15 We are greatly indebted to the Rev. E. Kelly of the Australian Baptist New Guinea Mission, whose knowledge of the Kyaka language is far more extensive than our own, for reading an earlier draft of this section of the paper and for being kind enough to interview two informants from Kalepongka parish (Sipunyi Clan) and send us their comments on several of the terms here listed (Kelly 1961). We are also very grateful to Dr. B. G. Biggs, our companion in the 1959 fieldwork, for his advice on matters of Kyaka orthography. 16 Text recorded on Tape 14 (1), 1959. 17 Informants from Ramui clan said that the culture-hero's name was Komba Ralingki, and that he was a large fair-skinned man.</page><page sequence="11">202 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY ghost').18 Several mortars in our collection were identified as imbw?nda stones, and also the bird figurine (S3). Lengke, who identified this bird in this way, was equally positive that the bird he personally gave us (18) was not one, but was a sorcery stone. We suspect that the imbw?nda identification was ma'de on account of the red ochre which is deeply ingrained in this piece, but unfortunately did not enquire at the time if this was so.19 Of the stones we collected, one mortar (189) and one pestle (191), purchased from the same man, Yawi Pame of Repikama census village, were said by the vendor to be imbw?nda ongko kana, the pestle being the "child" of the mortar. Another mortar (182) was said by the vendor, Sipunyi Dikyuwa of Kalepongka settlement, to be an imbw?nda kongko kana, as was also the bird figurine (18), mentioned above, acquired from Yawi Melepa of Repikama. We were unable to get a clear statement of what, if anything, differentiated imbw?nda ongko kana from imbw?nda kongko kana, but Mr. Kelly's Kalepongka informant gave him the following information: "ongko kana: smooth oval-shaped stone (approx. 6 ins.) with marks on it corresponding to nose and mouth. This stone was buried just under the ground in a special large house used by all men of the tribe (i.e. clan?R.B.). It was buried between the fire-place and the central post. If this stone was in the house females were not allowed inside. When the men were sitting in discussion in the house, if the stone showed its head above the ground, that would mean they should go to war.20 When a new house was built the ongko kana was searched for in the absence of females and strangers and secretly reburied in the new house. "Kongko kana: This was a rough-shaped stone which was buried alongside the ongko kana as a sort of companion but with no apparent magical significance. The women could go inside the house if only the kongko kana was inside." 18 cf. Aufenanger 1959:10, for a parallel among the Gende of the Bismarck Mountains. 19 Some informants from Kyaka clans to the west of the Lanim River were unfamiliar with the word imbw?nda. Wirz, however, reports imbuand as the Enga term for enclosures where fertility stones are kept and used in a cult very similar to the Mbowamb Goddess (Kor nganap) cult (Wirz 1952:50). Wirz does not say where he made his observations, but it is likely that these were among Laiapu Enga of the Minyampu Valley (Meggitt 1956:132). Dr. Meggitt (personal communication, 1961b) tells us that he has no record of this term among Central Enga (Mae and Laiapu). The traditions of several eastern Kyaka great-clans derive these groups from the 'other side' of the Mt. H?gen Range, which may be interpreted as the Minyampu Valley. 20 We know of no other record of fertility stones having significance for war among either Metlpa or Enga, though Meggitt reports a Waka Enga stone cult operated to destroy a clan's enemies (Meggitt 1956:116). How ever, Aufenanger reports this to be quite generally the case in the Waghi and Upper Jimi Valleys (Aufenanger 1959). In all of Aufenanger's examples, however, the stones are kept hanging in net bags, and are not buried. Their manipulation was supposed to bring success in war, though he gives one example from Mingende of their use as an oracle to determine if a fight would be successful (Aufenanger 1959:16).</page><page sequence="12">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 203 Sorcery stones are referred to as wambu pingki kana ('people smiting stone') and were differentiated by informants from both imbw?nda stones and other, lesser, magical stones. The act of manipu lating a sorcery stone is termed malyi kilyu (1st pers. sing, pres.): this verb is also used of the threatening waving of an axe or other weapon, or the token 'marking' of someone with a weapon, inflicting no physical damage but constituting a serious insult. The general term for stones used in divining and magic other than sorcery is pyerepa kana: any stone with a cord attached is normally identified by this term. Mena rooroo kana, (mena is 'pig') are stones used in pig magic. According to Mr. Kelly's informant such a stone was rubbed on the skin of a new-born piglet with the words, 'Let this pig become big as the stone down by the river'. Mr. Kelly's informant and some of mine said that pyerepa kana and mena rooroo kana were different: others of my informants said they were the same thing. In fact, as we have seen, a large part of stone-magic and divining is con cerned with pigs. Neta kana21 ('sun stone') most frequently refers to quartz crystals, which are often used as magic stones, sometimes as pendants, so that they frequently fall into the two categories last mentioned. One informant, from Mulipisa clan to the west of the Lanim River said that 'sun stones' were not necessarily quartz, but could be any stone. Mr. Kelly's Kalepongka informants referred to quartz as neta kapa ('sun egg', or 'sun grease'). They said that though quartz was treated as a curiosity it had no magical use, one of them adding that women sometimes put it in with the leaves in the string bag used for carrying an infant, as a decoration. The other informant had not seen this use, however. Mr. Kelly's informants also denied that neta kana was quartz. One of them said that this was something else, though he did not know what, as he had not seen any; the other had never heard the term. We have one Yaramanda reference to neta kapa, used here apparently as a synonym to neta kana. Roepo Rambua, a boy then aged about 14, told us in 1956 the following folk-tale explaining the origin of these stones.22 "A man of Kulimbu (the most northerly Kyaka settle ment of any size, only two or three hours' walk from the confluence of the Lai and Baiyer Rivers) made a garden and planted beans. Then he went into the forest to get beansticks. He found a baby bird, a Black Kite, and took it home and cooked it in the fire. It burned and flared up and burned the whole house down. Afterwards there were 'sun eggs' strewn all about." According to Yaramanda informants an alternative term for quartz is kula kana or kulakula kana, and they used this term when explaining to me that, apart from their magical uses, quartz fragments are used 21 Central Enga call fertility stones "eggs of the sun" and Ipili call them "eyes of the sun" (Meggitt 1957:53). Huli call round (natural?) cult stones "eggs of the sun (god)", and mortars, "hats of the sun (god)" (Glasse, personal communication, 1956). 22 Translated, at the time of telling, into Pidgin English, and not recorded as a text.</page><page sequence="13">204 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY in the processing of orchid or cane fibre for weaving into armbands, hafting axes, and other purposes. Mr. Kelly's informant however, described hula koma as a stone rubbed on a man's skin to preserve him from the effects of stone sorcery, when this has been performed against him. 3?Description of Figurines Collected Full-length human figures in stone are rare in New Guinea and the adjacent islands. H?ltker notes references to figures in soft stone, which are probably recent in date, from New Ireland, the Sepik River, and South-West Papua.23 Anthropomorphic stone figures, some of con siderable size, were important in the traditional religious cults of the Torres Straits Islands.24 As far as we know, only two full-length human figurines of undoubted 'prehistoric' origins have been described and figured from New Guinea. One is the small six-inch figure with front hollowed to make a mortar, reported from Manam Island by Thorpe.25 The other is the flat, plaque-like figure from the middle Ramu, described by England.26 Berndt notes the existence of another smaller fragment similar to the Ramu piece,27 in a private collection in the Highlands, and also reports 'a large stone figure of a female' near Tatagufa, south east of Mt. Michael, but had not seen this himself.28 The large figure from the Giriwo River headwaters, Eastern Papua, described by Etheridge and interpreted by him as a cuscus or other marsupial,29 may also possibly be taken as a human representation. The paucity of human figures in stone so far reported from New Guinea contrasts with their relative abundance in Indonesia and Eastern Polynesia. At least two human heads in stone have been described from low land New Guinea, both from the Huon Gulf.30 Possibly the 'proble matical' object from the Yodda Valley described by Sherwin31 should also be included in this category. We believe that our two specimens are the first to be described from the Central Highlands. Stone representations of birds are much more numerous. Apart from the 'recent* birds of New Ireland32 and the Torres Straits,33 H?ltker provides or notes descriptions of eleven 'prehistoric' examples,34 while McCarthy35 and Aufenanger36 describe three more each, and Schmitz one.37 Berndt notes the existence of others in a private collec tion in the Highlands.38 There are unpublished examples in the Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, and in the private collection of Mr. Peter Maxtone-Grahame of Minj, both of which are from the Wahgi Valley. Dr. Peter Lawrence informs us that he saw a stone or clay head shaped 23 H?ltker 1951:254-5. 24 Haddon 1935:361-2. 25 Thorpe 1930:352. 26 England 1946. 27 Berndt 1954:555. 2&lt;* Berndt 1954:559. 29 Etheridge 1908. 30 Schuster 1946; Schmitz 1956. 11 Sherwin 1938. 32 H?ltker 1951:254. 33 Haddon 1935:361. 34 H?ltker 1951:254. 35 McCarthy 1949. 36 Aufenanger 1960. 3* Schmitz 1956. 3?

Our five specimens all fall within the range of types already reported from the Highlands, as do the two examples from the Sepik region reported by H?ltker. Barton40 and H?ltker41 describe pestles the handles of which are bird figures. It seems likely that the birds and human heads in our collection were originally pestle-handles, as H?ltker and other authors have suggested for specimens which they describe. However, the possi bility should at least be entertained that some of these objects were flute heads. Wooden and clay heads for sacred flutes, in the form of both human heads and birds, have been reported from the Sepik Valley,42 and some of the human heads bear stylistic resemblances to the two we describe below. Human Figures I4743 Truncated human figure, obtained on 23rd April, 1955, from Kunje of Roepo Wapisuk clan, who said that he had inherited it from Kae, his putative agnatic great-grandfather and the founding ancestor of Kae subsubclan. The figure is 22.8 cm. long, 7.5 cm. wide and 10.7 cm. thick, weighs 4 lb. 6 oz., and is pecked out of crystal tuff.44 The figure may be interpreted as representing a man's upper body, the part below the waist being merely a rounded protuberance. The features evident are: face (raised nose ridge and flanges, raised eyes and circular indented mouth); head-dress, which may be interpreted as a wig or mob-cap such as is commonly worn by men in many of the present day cultural groups of the Western Highlands District; collar bones; protuberant belly; arms, upper parts at sides and lower parts bent across under belly; penis between the lower arms. Stylistically this piece is reminiscent of the figure from the Giriwo River headwaters mentioned above45 in that shoulders, arms and nose are similarly delineated. However, the Kyaka piece does not suggest a phallus, which, as Etheridge points out, is a very plausible interpretation for the Giriwo figure. See Plate 3:c, d. S2 Round-based human figure obtained at Kendapena census village on 22nd September, 1959, from Pana, a school-boy of Kunyengga clan, who said that he had found it in a clump of cane-grass while making a garden. Pangke, an important man of the same clan, said first that he had thrown the stone out a year previously, because of hearing Mission teaching; later, that he had discarded it because it "fought" with his other fertility stones, causing sickness in his family; and finally, that 89 Lawrence 1960. 40 Barton 1908. 41 H?ltker 1951:236. 42 e.g. by Wirz 1959:15, and Fraser 1955. 43 Numbers are from collectors* register. S2 and S3 are to be deposited in the American Museum of Natural History, New York: the others are held at the Department of Anthropology and Sociology, the Australian National University, Canberra. 44 We are very grateful to Dr. G. A. Joplin and Mr. L. Noakes of Canberra, Mrs. Elise Tugby of Brisbane, and Dr. R. N. Brothers of Auck land for identifying stones. 45 Etheridge 1908.</page><page sequence="15">206 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY he had not thrown the stone away at all, but merely hidden it. This last statement, made when he discovered that we were likely to buy the stone for a substantial sum of money, was suspicious in that the normal way to hide such a stone is to bury it. In a violent argument Pana and Pangke each claimed exclusive ownership of the stone and though both were prepared to sell it to us it was with rather bad grace that they eventually accepted part payment each for it. Pangke said, through our interpreter (in the excitement of the negotiations we were unfortunately unable to record his statement verbatim), that the stone represented Kunyengga, the founder of the clan. The clansmen had decorated it with ochre (traces of this are visible on face and base), smeared pig's grease and blood on it, said spells over it and placed it on top of the earth-oven in which pork was being cooked. This ensured that men would grow strong, and that children and pigs would not die or grow sickly. By decorating the stone they could talk to their ancestor. It was also used in the Enga Semangko (Goddess) cult. This piece aroused great awe and amazement in all those Kyaka to whom we later showed it. The figure is 25 cm. long, and the base is 9 cm. wide and 11 cm. thick. It weighs 6 lb. 14 oz. and is made of pyroxene feldspar basalt. It has three sections separated by indentations running right round it. The upper section is the head with protuberant eyes, a long straight nose ridge terminated by an indented line representing a mouth, and a raised ridge surrounding the face. Although a more crudely made object than 147, it is in all these features somewhat similar. The middle section has two protuberances which may be interpreted as arms or breasts. The lower section is a large asymmetrically rounded base, without representational features. See Plate 2: c, d. Human Heads 14 Small elongated human face, on broken stem, obtained on 17th January, 1955, from Apanda, an old woman of Roepo Wapisuk clan by birth, living near Yaramanda census village and married into Anggalu clan. Apanda was formerly a spirit medium and prominent magico-medical worker. She said she obtained it from a brother, now deceased, but did not say what it had been used for. The face is 11 cm. long and 5.3 cm. broad, and the figurine weighs 10.75 oz. It is made of andesite, by pecking and grinding techniques. The nose is slightly damaged. This is a beautiful object, much more skilfully made and aestheti cally pleasing than the two large figures described above, but sharing three stylistic features with them: raised eyes, indented mouth, and raised rim right round the face. This raised facial rim is reminiscent of many Sepik masks and wooden figures. Dr. G. A. Joplin has suggested that this piece and the bird figurine 18 described below may have been made from volcanic bombs, the natural shape of which suggested the form of the artefact to the craftsman. See Plate 3:a, b. 174 Small human head on broken stem, obtained on 6th June, 1955, from Ropa, a young woman of Konggena settlement near Repikama census village. The head is 7.5 cm. long and 4.7 cm. broad. It weighs 7.75 oz. It is made of coarse crystal tuff, by pecking but with very little evident grinding. A cord is attached to the stem.</page><page sequence="16">Figurines and Other Stones of Power 207 This is stylistically unlike the other pieces in our collection, being essentially realistic in form, although the face and especially the nose are much exaggerated. The eyes are represented by hollows, not by protuberances as in the other stones. However, this piece also has analogues in recent Sepik art: there is a wooden Mundugamor flute-head of rather similar design illustrated by Fraser,46 while the Mundugamor mask the same author figures47 shares the enlarged but nevertheless realistic nose and the hollowed eyes. It may be remembered that the Lai and Baiyer Rivers are tributaries of the Yuat, on which the Mundugamor live. See Plate 2: a, b. Birds 18 Bird figurine with spread wings and separated legs, apparently broken from a base. Obtained on 19th January, 1955, from Tultul (Assistant Headman) Lengke of Yaramanda (Roepo Wapisuk clan), who obtained it from his father. This is the sorcery stone (wambu pingki kana) discussed on p. 198 and p. 199 above. From tip of beak to tip of tail it measures 8.8 cm., the wingspan is 7.1 cm., and the measurement from base to top of head is 8.7 cm. It weighs 6.25 oz. and is made of andesite by pecking and polishing techniques. The left wing is damaged and the front tip of the right wing slightly damaged. It may be compared with the Wahgi Valley example illustrated by Casey48 and Holtker.49 See Plate l:e, f, g. 20 Bird without head or tail, with truncated base, obtained on 21st January, 1955, from Mara, a man of Kimalip census village. It is 8.5 cm. long and 7.3 cm. wide, weighs 5.25 oz., and is made of what is probably crystal tuff. The neck is bound with cane or orchid fibre, to which a string is attached. See Plate 1 :c. 50 Headless bird on simple stem, obtained 19th January, 1955, from Ruwasi, a man of Repikama census village. It is 8.5 cm. long, weighs 6.75 oz., and is made of tuff. There is a deliberately shaped hollow in the neck or breast area, 3.4 by 1.3 cm. in size. The shoulders and tail are badly chipped. See Plate l:d. 102 Head of bird, obtained on 16th February, 1955, from Marenyi Kupyuwa of Yaramanda census village, who had obtained it from his father, then deceased. Height of object is 6.6 cm., distance from nose to back of neck is 5.0 cm., weight is 3.25 oz. It is made of tuff. The eyes are protuberant, as those of bird 18 above and of the first three human figures we describe. See Plate l:b. S3 Single-stemmed bird figurine obtained 5th December, 1959, from Melepa, a man of Yalimakali clan and Repikama census village. It is 8.8 cm. high and the body is 6.5 cm. long and 5.5 cm. wide. It weighs 5 oz. and is probably made of pyroxene feldspar basalt though the quantity of red ochre ingrained in the surface makes petrological identification uncertain. This is the imbw?nda cult stone referred to on p. 203 above. See Plate l:a. This piece closely resembles one of the birds figured by Aufenanger.50 46 Fr?ser 1953:pl.
