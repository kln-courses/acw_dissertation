<plain_text><page sequence="1">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' By GEORGE F. HOURANI On several occasions in his writings Ibn Sind discusses the problem of destiny (al-qadar), by which he means primarily the problem of reconciling the divine determination of human acts and characters with the rewards and punishments of the after-life, in such a way as to safeguard God's justice to man. This aspect of the problem of theodicy had arisen long before his time out of statements of the Qur'an and Traditions, and had been settled in their own fashions by Mu'tazilite and predestinarian theologians. Ibn Sina as a philosopher could hardly avoid offering a solution, if only to satisfy the doubts of his Muslim public ; but he goes beyond a perfunctory answer, and seems to show a genuine interest in finding an intellectually convincing solution consistent with his own philosophy. As would be expected, he interprets the data of the problem in his own terms and comes up with a distinctly Neoplatonic answer, while taking care to express this in a way that might have a chance of acceptance in his religious milieu, Muslim Iran of the early eleventh century A.D. The word ' destiny ' in the title and text of this article is used as a deliberately ambiguous translation of Arabic al-qadar. Omitting complexities, we may for our purpose distinguish two main significations of the word in the religious context of earlier Islam. The older usage is ' predestination ' of human acts and characters by a freely willed decision of God for each person. This is the apparent meaning of the word in the Qur'an and Traditions, and it was understood thus by Muslim theologians. But al-qadar also came to be used by Muslim philo- sophers in their own sense : ' determination' of man's life as a part of a cosmic system in which God causes His effects by the necessity of His nature and their natures. As in other cases, the philosophers found it convenient to employ an accepted Islamic term in a new way rather than draw attention to their own innovation of thought by inventing a new term. I shall therefore distinguish 'predestination' and ' determination' where it is required for analysis, but in many places it will be more suitable to use ' destiny', to reproduce as nearly as possible the full associations of Ibn Sina's language. Apart from the passages occurring in longer works on other subjects, which will be referred to below, Ibn Sind wrote two monographs on destiny which have survived. One is Risalat al-qadar 'Essay on destiny '.' This is written in a florid, rhetorical Arabic, with a vocabulary which would place it beyond the reach of readers unlearned in Arabic literature. It is one of a group of mystical works which Ibn Sind presented as the wisdom of the mythical HIayy b. Yaqzan. I shall refer to it, but it is not the subject of this article. The other monograph, of unknown date, is Risala fT sirr al-qadar 'Essay on the secret 1 Ed. and paraphrased by A. F.

One is extrinsic : the faulty state of the Hyderabad edition, which has been the most accessible version so far. Two further reasons are intrinsic to the essay as its author wrote it: the order of the argument is not altogether logical, and the exposition is very concise. The work therefore stands in need of elucidation, and I shall try to provide this in the present article. Ibn Sind's general thought on the problem of destiny will be described to the extent that is needed for this purpose. Finally I shall discuss the problem of Ibn Sind's style of philosophical writing in the essay. Editions and manuscripts Of the two printed editions, that of Cairo (1910) has not been available to me. That of Hyderabad (1934) is based on two manuscripts in Indian libraries, referred to below. The resultant edition is not very satisfactory, as I believe will be evident by a comparison of it with the text offered here. As there are many manuscripts of the work, some unobtainable by photography, I am not attempting a fully critical edition. But in view of the unlikelihood that such an edition will be produced in a foreseeable future, it seems worth while to publish a provisional text, based on a few good manuscripts, which will at least settle the main problems of meaning in the essay. The relevant bibliographies 3 list 14 manuscripts of the essay as existing in London, Istanbul, Tehran, and more eastern cities; and there are very likely others.4 Out of these I have used three manuscripts in photocopy, and controlled a fourth indirectly, as will be explained. I am grateful to the respective libraries for photographic services and permission to use their manuscripts in making this edition. B(1) : British Museum, 978.16 = Or. Add. 16659, fols. 369v-370r.

The spelling ' Aflatun ' for ' Aflatiin ' in line 33 seems to indicate an older tradition, not preserved in the other manuscripts used. I have made B(2) the basis of this edition; hence it is not listed for accepted readings (first position in the notes), except where it shares an accepted reading with another manuscript. 2 Ed.

No attempt is made to record here all the variant readings of B(1), I, and A, where B(2) is accepted. Hence the impression given by the notes that B(1) is superior to B(2) is misleading.

Someone asked the eminent shaykh Ab-i 'All b. Sind (may God the Exalted have mercy on him) the meaning of the Sfifi saying, ' He who knows the secret of destiny is an atheist '. In reply he stated that this matter contains the utmost obscurity, and is one of those matters which may be set down only in enigmatic form and taught only in a hidden manner, on account of the corrupting effects its open declaration would have on the general public. The basic principle concerning it is found in a Tradition of the Prophet (God bless and safeguard him) : 'Destiny is the secret of God; do not declare the secret of God'. In another Tradition, when a man questioned the Prince of the Believers, 'All (may God be pleased with him), he replied,' Destiny is a deep sea; do not sail out on it '. Being asked again he replied,' It is a stony path; do not walk on it '. Being asked once more he said,' It is a hard ascent ; do not undertake it '.54 The shaykh said: Know that the secret of destiny is based upon certain premisses, such as [1] the world order, [2] the report 55 that there is Reward and Punishment, and [3] the affirmation of the resurrection of souls. [1] The first premiss is that you should know that in the world as a whole and in its parts, both upper and earthly, there is nothing which forms an exception to the facts that God is the cause of its being and origination and that God has knowledge of it, controls it, and wills its existence ; it is all subject to His control, determination, knowledge, and will. This is a general and superficial account, although in these assertions we intend to describe it truly, not as the theologians understand it; 56 and it is possible to produce proofs and demonstra- tions of that. Thus, if it were not that this world is composed of elements which give rise to good and evil things in it and produce both righteousness and 53 The essay has been previously translated by Professor Arberry (see p. 26, n. 2). I should not have thought of repeating the work of the prince of translators, were it not for the faulty Hyderabad edition at his disposal. A preliminary translation by myself, from the same edition, was published prematurely in Muslim World, LIII, 2, 1963, 138-40. I have inserted numbers and letters in square brackets, to show what seem to be the divisions of the argument and facilitate the analysis which follows. 54 These Traditions do not explain the meaning of the original saying, they merely reaffirm the prohibition. 55 ' Report' (.adith) seems to hint that after-life Reward and Punishment in the usual sense are only traditional doctrines, not known by science. This view is confirmed below, and elsewhere, e.g. Shifi': Ildhiyyit, ed. I. Madkur, M. Y. Musa, S. Dunya, and S. Zayed, Cairo, 1960, Ix, 7, pp. 414 ff. 56 ' Truly ', i.e. according to the Neoplatonic system of causal determination, not the volun- taristic conceptions of Muslim kalim, Mu'tazilite and other. Thus Ibn Sini's ' destiny ' should not be called ' predestination '.</page><page sequence="8">32 GEORGE F. HOURANI wickedness in its inhabitants, there would have been no completion of an order for the world. For if the world had contained nothing but pure righteousness, it would not have been this world but another one, and it would necessarily have had a composition different from the present composition; and likewise if it had contained nothing but sheer wickedness, it would not have been this world but another one. But whatever is composed in the present fashion and order contains both righteousness and wickedness. [2] The second premiss is that according to the ancients Reward is the occurrence of pleasure in the soul corresponding to the extent of its perfection, while Punishment is the occurrence of pain in the soul corresponding to the extent of its deficiency. So the soul's abiding in deficiency is its ' alienation from God the Exalted '," and this is 'the curse', 'the Penalty', [God's] ' wrath' and 'anger', and pain comes to it from that deficiency; while its perfection is what is meant by [God's] ' satisfaction ' with it, its ' closeness ' and ' nearness' and 'attachment'. This, then, and nothing else is the meaning of 'Reward' and ' Punishment' according to them. [3] The third premiss is that the resurrection is just the return of human souls to their own world: this is why God the Exalted has said, ' O0 tranquil soul, return to your Lord satisfied and satisfactory'. These are summary statements, which need to be supported by their proper demonstrations. [a] Now, if these premisses are established, we say that the apparent evils which befall this world are, on the principles of the Sage,58 not purposed for the world-the good things alone are what is purposed, the evil ones are a privation, while according to Plato both are purposed as well as willed; [b] and that the commanding and forbidding of acts to responsible beings, by revelation in the world, are just a stimulant to him of whom it was foreknown [by God] that there would occur in him [performance of] the commandments, or (in the case of a prohibition) a deterrent to him of whom it was foreknown that he would refrain from what is forbidden. Thus the commandment is a cause of the act's proceeding from him of whom it is foreknown that it will proceed, and the prohibition is a cause of intimidation to him who refrains from something bad because of it. Without the commandment the former would not have come to desire the act; without the prohibition the latter would not have been scared. It is as if one were to imagine that it would have been possible for 100 per cent of wickedness to befall in the absence of any prohibition, and that with the presence of the prohibitions 50 per cent of wickedness has befallen, whereas without prohibitions 100 per cent would have befallen. Commandments must be judged in the same way: had there been no commandments nothing of righteousness would have befallen, but with the advent of the commandments 50 per cent of righteousness has occurred. 67 All the words put here within quotation marks are Islamic religious expressions which Ibn Sink is interpreting in his own way. 58 al-hakim, the epithet of Aristotle.</page><page sequence="9">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' 33 [c] As for praise and blame, these have just two objects. One is to incite a doer of good to repeat the like act which is willed to proceed from him; the second is to scare the one from whom the act has occurred from repeating the like of it, and [ensure] that the one from whom that act has (not) occurred will abstain from doing what is not willed to proceed from him, though it is in his capacity to do it. [d] It is not admissible that Reward and Punishment should be such as the theologians suppose: chastisement of the fornicator, for example, by putting him in chains and shackles, burning him in the fire over and over again, and setting snakes and scorpions upon him. For this is the behaviour of one who wills to slake his wrath against his enemy, through injury or pain which he inflicts on him out of hostility against him ; and that is impossible in the character of God the Exalted, for it is the act of one who wills that the very being who models himself on him should refrain from acts like his or be restrained from repeating such acts. And it is not to be imagined that after the resurrection there are obligations, commandments, and prohibitions for anyone, so that by witnessing Reward and Punishment they should be scared or refrain from what is pro- scribed to them and desire what is commanded to them. So it is false that Reward and Punishment are as they have imagined them. [e] As for the [system of] penalties ordained by the divine Law for those who commit transgressions, it has the same effect as the prohibitions in serving as a restraint upon him who abstains from transgression, whereas without it it is imaginable that the act might proceed from him. There may also be a gain to the one who is subject to penalty, in preventing him from further wickedness, because men must be bound by one of two bonds, either the bond of the divine Law or the bond of reason, that the order of the world may be completed. Do you not see that if anyone were let loose from both bonds the load of wickedness he would commit would be unbearable, and the order of the world's affairs would be upset by the dominance of him who is released from both bonds ? But God is more knowing and wiser. Problems of interpretation The text and translation presented above are, I believe, clear enough in the meaning of the individual sentences. But the meaning in general is still not clear. What is the problem of the essay ? What are the steps in the argument, and the conclusion ? To answer these questions, we have to deal with the two intrinsic kinds of obscurity mentioned at the beginning of this article, the illogicality and excessive brevity of the essay; and we may begin by specifying these apparent defects. [1]-[3] are the three 'premisses' (muqaddamat), which are initially stated together and then explained briefly in the same order. Now the peculiarity of this order is that it is logically inappropriate, because [2] implies [3] as its condition; [3] should therefore have been stated before [2]. The' Reward' and 'Punishment' spoken of in [2] are certainly states of the soul after death; VOL. XXIX. PART 1. 3</page><page sequence="10">34 GEORGE F. HOURANI this is proved both by the terms used, thawib and 'iqdb, which are not applied to ordinary rewards and punishments, and by what is said about them in [d] and in other works of Ibn Sina. Thus [3], the existence of an after-life, is basic to [2]. Further, what is said in [2] about this Reward and Punishment is determined by the character of the after-life described in [3]: it is ' a return of human souls to their own world' (without bodies), therefore Reward and Punishment can only be of souls alone. Thus the natural order of premisses in this context would be: [3] there is an after-life of the soul; [2] in that life souls receive a certain kind of reward and punishment.59 When we turn to the sections listed [a]-[e], further problems of order emerge. What is the relation of these sections to [1]-[3] ? The only clue given is at the beginning of [a], ' Now if these premisses are established, we say ... '. This is insufficient. We are not shown which of the lettered sections follow from which of the three premisses, or whether there is some other relation between them. Actually the lettered sections make the best sense when taken as further explanations of the premisses, or answers to objections against them, and this is how I shall take them in reconstructing the argument. But even if this is granted, the order of the five lettered sections does not correspond in a simple way to the order of the premisses. Four of them, [a], [b], [c], and [e], are connected in their subjects with [1], in a way which will be shown, but their series is interrupted by [d], which is connected with [2]. The order of my exposition will therefore be as follows: [1], [a], [b], [c], [e] [3] [2], [d] The brevity of the essay as a quantity is self-evident. But it is necessary to point out some features of this brevity which add to the work's obscurity. ' The secret of destiny ', if known, would certainly solve some problem, by bringing to light an understanding of destiny which is now hidden from most human minds. This much can be gathered from the introductory paragraph. But we are not told what the problem is. We are taken straight into three 'premisses', on which the secret is said to be ' based '. Then perhaps we may find out what the problem is when we come to the conclusion, to which the premisses will lead. But there is no conclusion either! So both the problem and its solution have to be inferred from the premisses and from what we know of Ibn Sina's concerns and ways of thinking in other writings. Besides, the whole argument is very 59 This correction would not be justified if the author were here concerned with proving an after-life from Reward and Punishment as previously known facts, used as evidence. He might then conceivably have reasoned in the order of implication : ' [2] we know there are Reward and Punishment of the soul after death; [3] such Reward and Punishment imply a life of the soul after death '. But in this essay Ibn SinA is taking the existence of an after-life of the soul as an accepted premiss; the appropriate order of exposition is therefore from the general assertion of a state [3], the after-life, to a specification of that state [2], certain experiences in that life. I have called Ibn Sink's order ' logically inappropriate ', rather than simply ' illogical ', just for this reason, that in another context ' [2] implies [3] ' would have been logical.</page><page sequence="11">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' 35 concise at every stage, and also needs to be filled out from the thought-world of the philosopher. He himself is conscious of this, as can be seen in two places where he says he is only giving a general summary of the premisses without their proofs. By now it will be natural to wonder why the essay has these peculiarities, and Ibn Sina's introduction may have suggested a reason. But it will be less prejudicial to the understanding of the essay's main content if we leave that question in suspense, and first examine the content in itself, seeking out what is intelligible in it without having come to any conclusions about the cause or causes of its recondite presentation. The main argument will therefore be set out next in the reconstructed order mentioned above, and the missing elements will be supplied, by inference from what is stated here and in other works. The reconstruction is, of course, a hypothesis, but it will be presented categorically ; its probability can then be judged from its internal coherence and its consistency with Ibn Sink's thought as a whole. After that we can consider his introduction and the question mentioned above. Elucidation The first task must be to find out what the problem is which the essay is trying to solve. This can best be done by considering the premisses on which the secret is said to be based. What is meant by 'basing a secret on premisses ' ? I think the three premisses are three propositions which, if they are all accepted as true, lead to a serious question. If we set the propositions in their medieval Islamic context, the question to which they lead comes easily to mind : If [1] all events in the world are caused by the power (qadar) of God, and [3] there is an after-life, and [2] in the after-life men are rewarded and punished, Then how can God be good ? And in particular how can He be just to man ? This is the classical problem of evil, with its special form the problem of divine justice. The latter had been brought to the fore by the Mu'tazilite theologians as early as the end of the eighth century, as a result of studying the difficulties raised by the Qur'an ; and it was still being discussed in Ibn Sina's time by the Persian Mu'tazilite 'Abd al-Jabbar (c. 937-1025), chief justice of Rayy, whose great work al-MughnT was very probably known to him.60 The problem is stated concisely by Ibn Sina in his Ishrdt : 'If there is destiny why is there Punishment ? ' 61 It is also the primary topic of Risflat al-qadar, in which Ibn Sind's travelling companion was unable to reconcile destiny with Reward and Punishment, and so came to doubt destiny.62 Ibn Sind's solution is not that of a 60 See al-Mughni ff abwdb al-tawh.id wa 'l-'adl, part 6.1, 'Justice and injustice', ed.

It is reached by interpreting the premisses in his own terms and answering objections that might be raised. [1] Ibn Sina asserts emphatically the complete determination of the world by God. We must understand this qadar in the Neoplatonic sense of the necessary emanation of everything else from the Supreme Being. Thus it is clear that in seeking a solution to the problem of divine justice he is not going to abandon or weaken this doctrine of destiny, even though he understands it very differently from theological 'predestination '. Then he mentions that this world which proceeds from God necessarily contains evil as well as good. The reason for this is indicated only briefly here: that without evil 'there would have been no completion of an order for the world ', and ' it would not have been this world but another one '. This explanation is inadequate, because it prompts the the question, Why did it have to be this world just as it is, and not another one ? Ibn Sind appears here to beg the whole question of the existence of evil in a world made by an omnipotent God. But we find his answer expounded more fully in the 'Metaphysics' of al-Shifd', along the following lines: A perfect, all-powerful Creator necessarily fulfils the maximum good in every possible variety of ways. ' So if someone objects, " It was possible for the First Governor to have brought into being pure good, free from evil ", we answer: That was not possible in this sort of existence. If it was a possibility of absolute existence, on the ground that there is a kind of absolute existence free [from evil], it was not this present kind ; it was something which had already emanated from the First Governor and existed in the intellectual, psychic, and celestial spheres, and there remained as a possibility the present sort '-i.e. our world, compounded of form and matter.63 The causes of evil are found only in the sublunary sphere, a minute part of the total universe, which contains matter. And even here there is far more good than evil, which strikes only a minority of individuals, leaving the majority untouched by real evil and allowing the preservation of the species.64 Con- sequently God is producing more good and less evil by creating this sphere than by refraining from its creation.65 'The outpouring of good does not require that a predominant good be abandoned because of a rare evil; for its abandonment would be worse than that evil, because the privation of that [good] which is capable of existing in the character of matter is a double privation and thus worse than a single one.' 66 63 - I1hiyyt, Ix, 6, p. 418. Cf. Ghazll, Tahafut al-falasifa, ed. M. Bouyges, Beirut, 1927, 250 : according to the philosophers the purpose of the celestial souls is to draw near to God by occupying successively every possible position in the universe and thus actualizing every potentiality in turn. 64 Ildhiyydt, IX, 6, p. 417. 65 op. cit., pp. 418, 421. 66 op. cit., p. 418. The double privation is of the good that is normally found in material things and the good that might conceivably have existed in place of the evil. The single privation is of the latter only.</page><page sequence="13">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' 37 So this is how the creation of our mixed sphere 'completes the order' of the world as a whole."' To have refrained from producing it would have been 'a greater fault in the total order of good '.68 Why evil is unavoidable in a sphere which has matter will be explained shortly in connexion with [a]. [a] is a very brief discussion of a further point about the relation of a perfectly good God to evil, so the passage goes naturally with [1]. It has been stated as true in [1] that everything in the world is willed (murdd bihi) by God; and it has been suggested, though much too briefly, how this fact can be reconciled with the existence of a certain amount of evil which God cannot avoid. But this position suggests a further problem. Does God really purpose (qasada) these things which He cannot help creating ? To will something is to perform the mental act which carries over into an external change in the world ; it is to create or to do. To purpose is at least to intend a certain result, consciously aware of what will be effected by the act of will, and possibly also to desire it. Now God as conceived by a Hellenistic philosopher necessarily wills everything that exists, good and evil. But it is an open question whether He purposes everything. Does He in any sense purpose the evil which He creates ? Ibn Sind contents himself with stating the different answers which he attributes to Aristotle and Plato : of the former, that the evil is not purposed, of the latter, that it is. He does not give his own preference. This reticence seems strange, since the question raised here poses a more acute dilemma than what has gone before. For, if Aristotle is understood as saying that God in no sense purposes evil, God seems unable to control fully what He wills by His conscious mind; while according to the view ascribed to Plato His will is controlled by His purpose, but this purpose now appears as partly sinister, with evil entering the very heart of God. But before we try to decide why Ibn Sind gives no opinion of his own here, it will be useful to turn again to what he teaches about evil in other works. In his discussions on providence (al-'indya) in the 'Metaphysics' and elsewhere Ibn Sind explains that in the material conditions of this world many things can only give their advantages at the risk of evil incidentally arising from them. The stock example is fire. Its burning power is precisely ' the aim that is purposed from fire ', but the movements of things in the world inevitably bring it occasionally into conflict with other things like flesh which are damaged by it.69 Another example is taken from human society: a certain amount of 67 Sirr al-qadar, [1] ; Ildhiyyit, Ix, 6, p. 421. 68 Ildhiyydt, Ix, 6, p. 418.

St. John of Damascus, De fide orthodoxa, Iv, 21 : God created people who He knows will sin; but if He had refused to create them, evil would have won a victory in preventing the creation of some people with potentialities of good. 69 Ildhiyydt, Ix, 6, pp. 420-1. Cf. Plato, Timaeus, 73 ff., for the original example : bone in the body is useful by its hardness, but this involves inflexibility which makes it liable to be broken.

HOURANI inequality in skills among men is necessary so that they will have mutual needs, which are the basis of the social order.70 Thus in each case the good effects are of the essence of the thing, while the evil is incidental. 'And because this is known in the First Providence, it is as if " purposed incidentally " (ka 'l-maqs~idi bi 'l-'aradi), so that evil enters into destiny incidentally, as if it were so to speak " pleasing to it incidentally ".' 71 Thus evil may be said to be ' intended ' by God, in the sense of intention defined by Henry Sidgwick as 'including not only such results of volition as the agent desired to realise, but also any that, without desiring, he foresaw as certain or probable '.7 But it is not desired by Him, i.e. 'purposed essentially'. Presumably Ibn Sind wanted to make out that God is conscious of the evil He produces without being blameworthy for it. We can now see how the statements attributed to both Aristotle and Plato could be harmonized with Ibn Sind's position, by defining' purpose ' in narrower and wider senses respectively. Aristotle's statement is right in the sense that evil is not desired by God, 'purposed essentially' or for its own sake, while Plato's statement is right in the sense that evil is intended by God, 'purposed incidentally' to what He desires-and unavoidably if the greater good is to be fulfilled. Ibn Sind might have shown in the present text how both the ancient philosophers were right in different senses, but perhaps he thought the matter too complex to explain satisfactorily in a short essay. Whatever his reasons for silence, a contemporary reader already familiar with his ideas would probably have been able to recall the distinction between the two senses of qasada, and consequently to work out quite easily Ibn Sina's relation to Aristotle and Plato on this question. [b] is continuous with [a] in syntax, since both are co-ordinate object- sentences following the main verb ' we say '. Both sections deal with problems arising from the divine omnipotence asserted in premiss [1], but they are two distinct problems. [a] has discussed briefly a moral objection to divine omnipo- tence, that it seems to make evil purposed by God. [b] discusses a more ' scientific' objection, that if God is omnipotent His commands and prohibitions to men cannot be explained by any purpose. It is hard to see why Ibn Sind has run these two sections together in this manner without a break. Perhaps one objection to divine omnipotence suggested another one by a rather free association of ideas, and the distinction between God's purpose and His will recalled another well-known distinction, between His will and His command. 73 [b] is concerned with the objection that if human acts were determined (or predestined) the commands and prohibitions issued to men in revelation would be useless, for God would not exhort and try to persuade people whose acts were 70 Arzdq, 206. 71 Ishirit, II, 736; tr.

This was a Mu'tazilite objection 74--indicating once more that the theologians whom Ibn Sina was confronting in Iran of the early eleventh century were of Mu'tazilite and associated Shi'ite tendencies, not predestinarian Ash'arites who had scarcely been heard of in that country and time.75 Ibn Sind's answer is that the commands and prohibitions of God are themselves parts of the grand causal system which governs the universe, for they act as stimulants and deterrents to men's minds. The effect of the commands accompanied by promises of rewards, and of the prohibitions accompanied by threats of sanctions, is that human wills perform the commands and respect the prohibitions in far more instances than they would have done without these stimuli. In a modern-sounding example Ibn Sina illustrates his doctrine by imagined percentages of increased efficacy. He supposes that without the help of revelation men would be completely wicked, but with its help half of them can be rescued. [c] makes the same point about praise and blame as [b] has about commands and prohibitions. They are stimuli to future action, and so have a place in a determined world. We must understand the praise and blame referred to as those of scripture for certain acts, if we are to see this section as relevant to the main question. The point is once more to find a purpose in an aspect of God's revelation which might appear useless in view of His determination of human lives. [e] makes the same point with regard to the earthly punishments ordained by scripture (al-hudiid). They are indispensable as sanctions, to restrain those people who would not be restrained by their own rational appreciation of the social order. Ibn Sind's attitude to the sanctions of the next life is quite different, as will be seen. [3] There is a resurrection, though it applies only to human souls. Ibn Sind makes it evident in the 'Metaphysics' 76 that he does not believe in the 73 The distinctions that have been made can be clarified by a diagram : Willed by God (everything) Purposed, i.e. Not purposed, i.e. intended by God not intended by God (everything) (no members of class) Purposed essentially, Purposed incidentally, i.e. intended and desired by God i.e. intended but not (includes commanded acts done desired by God (in- by man).

HOURANI resurrection of bodies. It is something reported in revelation, but not known by reason or cared for by the wise. [2] The second premiss was originally stated as 'the report that there is Reward and Punishment '. This doctrine creates the most acute difficulty about the justice of God, when it is combined with either predestination or determinism, for it means that God punishes men for acts which He has willed them to do. The Mu'tazila had solved the problem in the terms in which they had faced it, by denying predestination, and would no doubt have denied determinism as well. Ibn Sina, while not accepting traditional predestination, insists on determinism which is central to his philosophy. His solution is different : to deny Reward and Punishment, in the usual sense of requital for deserts imposed by another person. His initial description of this dogma of Islam as a ' report' (hadith). now appears significant. Here he reinterprets that dogma figuratively, claiming that what are described as the 'Rewards' and 'Punishments' of the other life are in fact the inevitable effects of the soul's own behaviour in the present life. Its pleasures there are like the results of healthy living, its sufferings like the pains of a diseased body. It should be noticed that Ibn Sinm attributes this doctrine to the ancient philosophers, and it is at any rate of Platonic inspiration." Yet we know that it is his view, for in the 'Metaphysics' he states it with some elaboration as his own.'" Why he does not endorse it here will become clear later when the method of the essay has been examined. Whereas [2] shows briefly the reality of the soul's fate in the next life, [d] completes the argument by giving the negative side of this, denying that there is any reward or punishment in the proper sense after death. It is pointed out that there is no place at that stage for stimulation and deterrence, since man is no longer under obligations or on probation. The only conceivable motives for chastising him would be anger and revenge, and these are impossible in God and contradict the ideals of mercy which He himself prescribes to man.79 The whole argument may now be resumed. [Main problem: If God wills man's evil acts, yet punishes him for them, is He not unjust ?] [1] Good and evil are willed by God, as part of the causal order. [a] Aristotle says evil is not purposed by Him, Plato says it is. [b, c, e] The commands, blame, etc., in revelation, and the prescribed earthly punishments all have causal functions. [3] There is an after-life of the soul. 77 See Phaedo, 80-2 ; Phaedrus, 246-56 ; Respublica, x, 613-20. But Plato puts his accounts of the after-life in the form of myths, and includes in them a Judgment and a choice as well as an element of necessity. 78 Ildhiyydt, Ix, 7, pp. 423 ff. 79 cf. Risalat al-qadar, Ar. pp. 17-20: God does not need to stick to His word in executing uselessly the exaggerated Promises and Rewards announced in revelation. To imagine Him as a vain despot is the result of weak anthropomorphic analogies.</page><page sequence="17">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' 41 [2] Its ' Rewards ' and ' Punishments ' are effects of the soul's conduct and habits on earth, [d] not rewards and punishments handed out by God. [Solution: God is not unjust, for He does not punish man after death. In the present life He helps man to improve his soul and so increase its happiness in the after-life.] Thus Ibn Sina has worked out 'the secret of destiny' by upholding the divine determination very firmly and reinterpreting Rewards and Punishments. The solution as presented above follows a logical order and arrives at conclusions which accord with his philosophy. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss whether it is a convincing solution. The style of the essay After this reconstruction and interpretation of the essay, it is time to inquire why Ibn Sina expressed himself in a way which needs so much unravelling. Two lines of explanation suggest themselves: that he wrote carelessly, or that the obscurity was deliberate. These explanations are mutually exclusive for any one utterance (word, phrase, or sentence), because carelessness and deliberation are indirectly contradictory of each other : carelessness implies lack of thought, deliberation implies thought. But there is nothing to prevent careless obscurity and deliberate obscurity from being present in different parts of the whole essay. Let us see, then, what are the arguments favouring each alternative in general, and whether any points of detail can be found as evidence for either of them in particular parts. In favour of the hypothesis of carelessness, it can be pointed out that Ibn Sina claimed to be capable of writing very rapidly,80 and sometimes wrote much in unpropitious conditions-while accompanying his sovereign on army campaigns, or sitting through a night and drinking wine.81 The brevity of expression might be largely spontaneous, if Ibn Sina was writing for a circle of disciples and friends familiar with his ideas and able to supply for themselves what was implicit. Against these considerations it must be said that Ibn Sina is not usually a careless writer, and the present essay is quite precise in its detailed language, except for three insignificant examples of loose grammar (recorded in the notes to the Arabic text). And what are we to think of the illogical order of the argument, and the omission to state the problem and the conclusion ? It is hard to believe these are uncontrolled oversights in the work of so great a logician, and we should certainly heed the principle put forward by Leo Strauss for such cases : 'If a master of the art of writing commits such blunders as would shame 8so At the end of the Risdla ft mihiyyat al-saldt ' Treatise on the nature of prayer ', two of the manuscripts have a final paragraph in which it is claimed that the work was written ' in less than half an hour, amid many distractions ' : Mehren, Traitgs mystiques, III, ii, p. 42. As the treatise covers 15 pages in the edition, this is barely possible, in the absence of shorthand dictation. The paragraph is bracketed by Mehren. 81 Abfi 'Ubayd al-Jiizjdni's biography of Ibn Sini, in editor's introduction to Mantiq al- mashriqiyyin, Cairo, 1328/1910, pp. .h, yd ; tr.

HOURANI an intelligent high school boy, it is reasonable to assume that they are intentional, especially if the author discusses, however incidentally, the possibility of intentional blunders in writing '.82 Ibn Sina does not, so far as I know, discuss just this possibility, but there are other indications that point no less surely to a definite method. So let us con- sider the other explanation, deliberate secrecy. Ibn Sina's place in the medieval esoteric tradition is well established and can easily be documented. His introduction to Mantiq al-mashriqiyyin makes an explicit distinction between the author's earlier, Aristotelian books, which were intended for ordinary students of philosophy, and the present 'oriental' work which contains ' the principles of true science '. 'We did not compose this book to reveal it to anyone but ourselves, i.e. those who are in our situation. As for the generality of those who pursue this interest, we have already given them plenty, more than they need, in the Shifa'.' 83 Among the esoteric works is the last part of the Ishdrit, which he calls the cream of wisdom, to be withheld from those who would waste it, those not gifted with inspired intelligence, etc.s4 At the end of his study 'On the nature of prayer' he writes, 'I forbid this treatise to be shown to anyone whom passion has led astray and branded his heart '.85 But, beside the more ' exoteric ' works of philosophy and the more ' esoteric' mystical ones, there is a third group which appear at first sight more popular, presenting subjects in a short and simple manner, but which in fact contain deeper meanings only perceptible to thoughtful readers. This type of work would be useful when it was required or desirable for any reason to write some- thing, on serious subjects like religion and philosophy, that would circulate among a wider public than students of those subjects. The model was the Qur'an. In the chapter on prophecy of the ' Metaphysics ', Ibn Sink mentions the mental confusion created in ordinary people by attempts to teach them advanced theology, and says it is the duty of a prophet ' to acquaint them with the Majesty and Might of God the Exalted by means of symbols (rumfz) and images (amthila) ' of familiar things; and 'it is not good for a man to appear openly to possess knowledge of a truth which he is concealing from the public '. 'But there is no harm if his speech contains symbols and allusions (ishirat), to draw persons naturally qualified for theoretical studies to undertake philoso- phical inquiry.' 86 In ' On the nature of prayer ' he says near the end that he would have gone into more detail, 'but it was difficult for us to enter upon matters in which it is not good for everyone to receive instruction. For such people we have therefore laid 82 Persecution and the art of writing, Glencoe, Ill., 1952, 30. 83 Ibn SinA's introduction to Mantiq al-mashriqiyyin, 4. Cf. Ibn Tufayl, IHayy b. Yaqg.in, ed.

Then he adds, 'Solve the enigma (hilli 'l-ramza) if you are able '."8 This is significant for our problem because it shows ramz clearly in the meaning of an ' enigma ' or ' puzzle ' to be solved, and not merely a ' sign ' or ' symbol '. With this background we can consider the introduction to the essay. Ibn Sina is asked to explain, not the secret of destiny but only the meaning of the .Sifi saying condemning knowledge of the secret. It is indeed difficult for us to see how the possession of knowledge could make a man an atheist (mulhid), unless we suppose that the truth about destiny implies that there is no god- which is certainly not Ibn Sina's view in any of his writings. It is tempting to read 'arrafa 'makes known' for 'arafa 'knows ', to give an easier meaning, that teaching the secret is condemned. This is textually possible, but there are factors weighing against it (see line 3, n. 9). In any case the problem comes up again in the three sayings of 'Ali, which unmistakably discourage seeking knowledge. So we must do the best we can with the reading 'knows ', and try to understand the saying in the light of Ibn Sina's reply. He says that' this matter ', i.e. the secret of destiny, is an obscure question, knowledge of which would corrupt the general public-by confusing their minds, as we can safely understand from elsewhere.89 Thus the reason for not teaching them is a fault in their knowing if taught, a confusion in their thinking about religion which could be described as 'atheism'. It is implied in the reply of Ibn Sina and the Tradition of Mul.ammad quoted that the secret is known to someone, of the rank of a prophet or philosopher. The three sayings of 'All suggest that he too knows it, which would readily be understood since 'Ali in medieval Islam was thought of as a master of esoteric wisdom. We can conclude, then, that the Siifi saying is not meant to discourage everyone from knowing the secret of destiny, but only the vast majority. This interpreta- tion is in line with Ibn Sina's general position, illustrated above with quotations from other works. The opening paragraph thus gives an answer to the question asked at the 87 Mdhiyyat al-salat, ed. Mehren, III, ii, p. 42. Immediately after this he forbids the essay to be circulated, as noted above : which seems in conflict with the method just stated, or at least unnecessary. It is hardly if at all possible to make a clear-cut division of all of Ibn Sink's works into the three types mentioned, and to find a consistent policy throughout his writings. The question of his esoteric methods is complex and needs further study. On the symbolic method of the ' Hayy ' cycle of mystical fables see H. Corbin, Avicenne et le recit visionnaire, 2 vols., Tehran and Paris, 1954. For a comprehensive introduction to esoteric writing in Islam see N. R. Keddie, 'Symbol and sincerity in Islam', Studia Islamica, xix, 1963, 27-63. 88 Ishdrdt, ed. Dunya, 790-3. Goichon, 485, translates: 'Ensuite, d6couvre le sens de l'all6gorie si tu en es capable'.

IOURANI beginning of the essay, and with that the essay might have ended since its formal subject has been dealt with. But it then takes a surprising turn : Ibn Sink goes on to discuss the secret of destiny itself, which he was not asked about and which he has just said would be harmful if declared openly (izVhrihi). The apparent strangeness of his procedure is brought out in the title of the work, whether it is original or not: Risdlafi sirr al-qadar. Does one publish an essay on a secret ? The conclusion to which we are led almost inevitably is that Ibn Sink wants to write about destiny in the only way he thinks permissible: 'in enigmatic form (marmltza)' and 'in a hidden manner (maknilna)'. This puts the essay in the third group, mentioned above, of' popular' works which also contain a deeper meaning, not apparent to every reader. Several questions may be raised about this conclusion, which will now be answered briefly in order. What were Ibn Sink's specific reasons for secrecy on the subject of destiny, beyond the vague assertion that plain teaching on it would harm the public ? We can find in his own doctrine elements that would be unsettling to less sophisticated Muslims of his time. The whole problem of evil which is raised might not occur to many of them if left to themselves. And those to whom it did occur might be more easily satisfied with a simple answer, in terms of the will of a personal God, than with an answer depending on Neoplatonic premisses about a necessary world order and the metaphysical relation of evil to matter. More especially, the denial of after-life Reward and Punishment in the proper sense might be seriously disturbing to morality and to belief in scripture. Ibn Sink's sensitivity on this matter appears from his precautions in discussing it : in [2] he puts his own view in the mouth of the ancient Greek philosophers, while in [d] he attributes the conventional view to 'the theologians (al- mutakallimiin)', not to the Qur'an. By contrast, in a work like the 'Meta- physics ', which would be read by philosophy students only, he did not need to take such precautions but could state his theory more plainly. But in view of these dangers, what reasons did Ibn Sina have to publish anything at all on the subject in a short, popular form, at the risk of injuring public religion ? It is not an adequate answer to say that the purpose lay in the expounding of a hidden meaning to the elite; for they had access to the author's views formulated as clearly as the subject would allow in various places in his straight 'exoteric' and 'esoteric' books. The question is not easy, and any answer must be tentative, in the absence of knowledge about the occasion of the essay; but two lines of approach can be suggested. First we must notice a circumstantial reason: that 'someone asked' Ibn Sink about destiny. If this questioner was a prince or a minister, it may have been difficult for him to avoid a reply altogether. Still, he could have said less, and we have to look for a more interior and positive reason. From what we know of Ibn Sina as a sincere scholar it is fair to believe that he wished to make use of every opportunity to hand on a portion of truth to someone ; the question is, to whom, in a work such as the essay ? I think the key to an answer is given in a passage already quoted about the method of a prophet :</page><page sequence="21">IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' 45 'But there is no harm if his speech contains symbols and allusions, to draw persons naturally qualified for theoretical studies to undertake philosophical inquiry '.90 What this points to is that enigmatic writing is not meant for the accomplished adept but for the novice, to arouse his curiosity and stimulate his intellect to work on the problems involved. The point has been so well put by Leo Strauss, with reference to all this class of writing, that I take leave to quote from him again : 'Those to whom such books are truly addressed are, however, neither the unphilosophic majority nor the perfect philosopher as such, but the young men who might become philosophers : the potential philosophers are to be led step by step from the popular views which are indispensable for all practical and political purposes to the truth which is merely and purely theoretical, guided by certain obtrusively enigmatic features in the presenta- tion of the popular teaching-obscurity of the plan, contradictions, pseudo- nyms, inexact repetitions of earlier statements, strange expressions, etc. Such features do not disturb the slumber of those who cannot see the wood for the trees, but act as awakening stumbling blocks for those who can '.91 The reverse side of this reason is that Ibn Sind must have felt confident enough that what he was writing down here was so garbled that it would not 'disturb the slumber' of these ungifted for such studies. All they would get would be impressions of a profound philosopher discoursing on a God who governs the whole order of the universe and is not vengeful, on the divine purposes in the commands and prohibitions of revelation, on pleasures and pains in a life of the soul beyond the grave .... The more questionable opinions that they read were those of pagan philosophers of long before Islam, whose theories could be reported as matters of historical interest, unlikely to under- mine the faith of any genuine Muslim. We may find Ibn Sina naive in his confidence that such writings would not be understood by ordinary Muslims sufficiently to unsettle their faith or provoke a public reaction against philosophy. But it is well to remember that in fact no great reaction came until half a century after his death, and that when it came it was directed not against such essays but against the more professional works, which Ghazall took pains to understand before criticizing them from the standpoint of a Sunni 'dlim. And in general the Greek philosophical tradition was continued in the Islamic world for hundreds of years, without attracting too much adverse attention; the trial and temporary disgrace of Ibn Rushd in twelfth-century Muslim Andalusia was an exception. The discrete caution of the philosophers in publicizing their theories was no doubt one reason for their long survival. Next we should ask about the methods of concealment used by Ibn Sina. We seem to have found three : changing the order, silence and brevity, ascribing 90 Ildhiyydt, x, 2, p. 443. 91 Persecution and the art of writing, 36.</page><page sequence="22">46 GEORGE F. HOURANI views to others. Are there any precedents or parallels in other writers of the medieval Islamic and Arabic world, to help to convince us that Ibn Sina might have used these devices intentionally, and that readers educated in the same learned tradition would have been on the look-out for them ? With regard to jumbling the order of the argument, several clues, more or less indirect, can be mentioned. (a) Farabi, Ibn Sina's predecessor whose thought had the greatest influence on him, had spoken with approval of Plato's method of teaching philosophy to an inner circle: 'So he chose symbols (rumiiz) and enigmas (alghdz), aiming thereby to compose his sciences and wisdom in a manner that could only be fathomed by those who are meritorious', etc.92 Ramz has the initial meaning of' sign, hint, allusion', and is probably so used here, but laghz is more exclusively 'enigma, riddle, puzzle'. The approved Platonic method therefore definitely includes this type of concealment. (b) Speaking of Aristotle's method, Farabi quotes a supposed letter from Aristotle to Plato in which he gives a defence of his practice of committing his learning to writing, in the following terms : 'If I have written down these sciences and the wisdom contained in them, I have arranged them (rattabtuhd) in such an order that only those qualified for them can attain them '.93 (c) We have seen previously a sentence of Ibn Sind in another treatise where he speaks of' solving a ramz', i.e. clearly 'an enigma' ; so marmilza in the present essay can mean ' enigmatic ', not just ' in signs ' or ' symbols '. (d) In the large Arabic literature on the occult sciences known as jafr, one of the methods was the transposition of letters in a word to form another word. 94 (e) Ibn Sink himself was partial to acrostics, for he played with another common method of jafr, the use of a well-known magic square of nine Arabic letters with numerical values, corresponding to the hierarchy of beings in the universe. 95 (f) In his summary of the Arabic astrological compendium Ghkyat al-hakim, Martin Plessner calls attention to the interrupted order of treatment, in which ' subjects which belong together are separated' ; and he suggests that this method may be intentional, to make the magical sections less prominent or for other reasons. He also points out that a similar presentation is found in the 92 al-Jam' bayna ra'yay al-4akimayn Afldti.n al-ildhi wa Aristit.lis, ed. A. N. Nader, Beirut, 1960, 84. Cf.

And even those are not set down in order or arranged in coherent fashion in this Treatise, but rather scattered and entangled with other subjects that are to be clarified '.9s (h) The stiras of the Qur'in are notable for the discontinuity of their thought- sequences. However a modern orientalist such as Richard Bell may explain this in terms of early editing,99 in medieval Islam it was taken as certain that the order within each stira of the Qur'an was intended in every detail for some divine purpose. Such a model might well encourage a similar feature in a human book of wisdom that was meant to be enigmatic. These diverse examples should be enough to convince us that a jumbling of order was entirely within the range of devices for concealment which would occur to the minds of Ibn Sina and his learned readers. It would, of course, occur to some who were unsympathetic, but it could be hoped that they would not take the trouble to re-arrange, or would be unable to do so for lack of familiarity with the underlying system of thought. Disciples, on the other hand, would have little difficulty in making the re-arrangement, especially since the disorder is not very extensive. A difficulty might be raised here about the lack of paragraphs in Arabic texts. I have inserted paragraphs with numbers and letters, but what indication would readers of Ibn Sina's original manuscript have of where the sections of the argument began and ended ? This is easily answered: Arabic writers commonly indicated paragraphs by overlines above the opening words, and Ibn Sind may have done so. It is not surprising that these have not survived in the copies that have reached our century.100 In support of brevity and silence (which we can take together as one method) there is a good precedent in Farabi's approving statement about the method of Aristotle: that though in general he writes in a plain and straightforward 96 ' Picatrix ', das Ziel des Weisen von Pseudo-Magri.t, tr. H. Ritter and M. Plessner, London, 1962, p. lix. The ' Encyclopedia' was earlier than Ibn SinA and known to him. 97 The self-contradiction is in Maimonides. But his explanation will not take the outsider very far. See L. Strauss, Persecution and the art of writing, ch. iii. 98 Daldlat al-.h4'irin, ed. S. Munk, Jerusalem, 1929, 3; as tr. by S. Pines, The guide of the perplexed, Chicago, 1963, 6. 19 Introduction to the Qur'&amp;n, Edinburgh, 1953, ch. v, and his translation, 2 vols., Edinburgh, 1937-9, passim. 100 B(1) has overlines above certain quotations and the beginning words of [c] and [e]-- obvious divisions since they start with ammii 'as for'. B(2) has them for ' The shaykh said', and the second and third premisses-three major divisions. In neither case can we attach any relevant significance to these crude and incomplete attempts at paragraphing. There is always a hope that one or more of the unexamined manuscripts will have preserved something more original.</page><page sequence="24">48 IBN SINA'S 'ESSAY ON THE SECRET OF DESTINY' manner, there is much that is recondite, obscure, and complicated-e.g. omission of essential premisses of a philosophical argument, omission of one member of a pair, to be understood from the other, etc.101 With reference to Maimonides, Strauss says: 'Another device consists in silence, i.e. the omission of something which only the learned, or the learned who are able to understand of themselves, would miss '.102 It seems unnecessary to substantiate this method any further, since it is central to any enigmatic writing. Lastly, the method of attributing one's beliefs to ancient writers of prestige is a common feature of medieval literature, which appears in many forms. The most pertinent precedent for Ibn Sind is again Fdrdbi, who composed entire books on the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle, whose positions he evidently endorses. Any conclusions about the secret meaning of a piece of writing and any reconstruction of its composition must from the nature of the case be accepted with caution, more especially since the challenge of discovering and deciphering a secret is attractive to scholars. But in the light of all that has been shown, I believe we can confidently state at least this much about the 'Essay on the secret of destiny ' : that the probability of some conscious reserve in the manner of writing it on the part of Ibn Sind is very much greater than the probability that the difficulties of the essay are entirely due to his negligence. We have to be less confident in claiming to have discovered correctly the precise nature of his reserve and the inner meaning which he intended his more perceptive readers to see ; for we are, after all, not among that group, nor have we had the benefit of oral instruction or of living as contemporaries in his intellectual milieu. What can fairly be claimed, however, is that the interpretation of his meaning given above makes sense and is consistent with the rest of his thought. If this is so, it can stand until a better hypothesis is worked out. 101 Jam', 84-5. 102 Persecution and the art of writing, 75.</page></plain_text>
