<plain_text><page sequence="1">v MARLOWE, FAUSTUS, AND SIMON MAGUS FEW readers of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus would, I think, concur in the judgment pronounced by a popular contemporary critic who de- clares that Faustus is "essentially childish. ... He longs for magic power like a boy who has read the Arabian Nights." Instead of juvenile simplicity, the magician of Wittenberg presents, for most of us, a highly complex problem of personality, embodying in his single nature most magnificent aspiration, most basely earthbound satisfaction. The Faust- us of the opening and closing scenes, and of certain ones between, is authentic superman, exalted by the passionate urgency of his yearning into a vast and lofty plane of being. Yet, once possessed of magic, this superman becomes, in his exercise of it, boor, buffoon, and sensualist. This provocative dualism traces back to only a limited extent to the Historie of the Damnable Life and Deserued Death of Dr. Iohn Faustus. In the legendary hero resides so little of the heroic that no incongruity appears. He is hardly more than an abnormally curious scholar, eager to experiment with magic, unreflectively ready to pay the price, automat- ically remorseful. We need not perhaps go all the way with a recent scholar, who characterizes the hero of the Faustbook as "a species of superquack, a swaggering half-scholar, who frivolously swaps his im- mortal soul for worldly advantage."' Yet Faustus the mountebank who capers through the scenes of crude buffoonery, and the sensualist Faust- us who demands unlimited satisfaction of appetite at no time rises above the characterization applied to him in the Historie-a man of "naughtie mind" and "toward (?) wit."2 His character in relation to his career is summarized by Mephistopheles in terms which are borne out by the narrative itself: "Thy maker hast thou denied and defied, yea wickedly thou hast applyed that excellent gift of thine understanding and giuen they soule to the Diuell: therefore give none the blame but thine own selfe-will, thy proude and aspiring minde."3 Yet this ignoble trafficker with demons is introduced to us by Marlowe as a great figure, who is potentially tragic in his superhuman defiance of human limitation, and who in the poignancy of his defeat still remains a fallen Titan. Through what process was this metamorphosis effected? How could the meager stimulus provided by the commonplace hero of the Faust- 1 Otto Heller, Faust and Faustus, A Study of Goethe's Relation to Marlowe, Washington University Studies, New Series, Language and Literature, No. 2 (1931), p. 73. 2 Ch. 1; cf. the very useful compilation Sources of the Faust Tradition from Simon Magus to Lessing, edited by P.

The problem cannot be solved by a subjective criticism which would reject all the uninspired passages as non-Marlovian, although this method is employed by certain commentators,4 who strain to breaking point the testimony as to additions to Marlowe's work by other hands.5 The paradox of artistic inconsistency in Dr. Faustus stands out sharply when one compares this play in respect to the source situation with Tamburlaine. Here Marlowe found an example of greatness made to his hand; in Miss Ellis-Fermor's phrase "a figure, a situation, a series of events which seems shaped by nature to hold his own burning thought."6 The figure in the Faustbook, on the other hand, who might have stood in any of a hundred exempla to illustrate the sin of forbidden knowledge, was plainly not shaped by nature to hold Marlowe's burning thought. Was it, then, a mere caprice of the creative faculty which made of Faust- us a hero who is in imagination almost a God, in the practice of magic a coarse trickster? A more rational explanation, making use of objective evidence, seems called for. Such an explanation is supplied, I believe, by the evidence offered in the following pages that Marlowe, at points of special imaginative appeal, enlarged the figure in his original to heroic proportions by superimposing on his immediate source the legend of Simon Magus, which included a similar situation and presented a hero identical in many respects with the hero of the Faustbook, but in his nobler aspect a superman, potentially tragic. This explanation involves no inherent improbability, since in the case of poets of rich and active memory, the exclusive use of a single source is rare. The blending of a secondary inspiration with the direct literary source of Dr. Faustus would supply merely another instance of a process frequent in poetic creation. Nonetheless, this hypothesis must encounter at the outset a generally accepted dictum of Marlowe critics in regard to the source for Dr. Faustus, which is affirmed by Professor Boas in these words: "There is no doubt that the English History was Marlowe's only authority."7 4 Jusserand has voiced his disapproval of this method: "According to the more or less favorable idea they have formed of Marlowe's purity of taste, critics have more or less liberally attributed to different authors the clumsy or ridiculous parts of the drama" (A Literary History of the English People, p. 139). 6 Viz., the well-known record in Henslowe's Diary for November 22, 1602, of a payment of ?4 to William Birde and Samuel Rowley "for ther adicyones in doctor Fostes" (cf. n. 102 following).

The figure of the posited superman must be one so closely associated in tradition with the legendary Faust as to have thrust itself inevitably into the field of Marlowe's imaginative vision. 2. The literary treatments of this figure must have been available to Marlowe and of a type not alien to his temper and interest. 3. These materials must have left upon the play of Dr. Faustus such unmistak- able concrete impress, apart from any indirect influence through the Historie, as to establish his independent use of them. All these conditions, are met by the legend of Simon Magus. I. Simon Magus and the Faust Tradition before Marlowe Although an influence upon Marlowe from the legend of Simon Magus has not hitherto been suggested, it is breaking no new ground to relate the name of the great conjurer to the earlier Faust tradition in its more generic aspects. Simon the magician has been mentioned by editors as a prototype or "Vorfahrer" of the German Faust,8 and his legend is in- cluded among possible "forerunners" of the Faust legend by the com- pilers of a recently published collection of source materials.9 Minor similarities between the two traditions have been noted by theological scholars, and reflections of these appeared sporadically in early Faust criticism. The association of Faust with Simon Magus has, then, been admitted in a general sense, but for the most part disregarded by Faust scholars. One among these, however, was disturbed by the universal reluctance to give due consideration to patristic materials as sources for the Faust tradition. In 1882 Theodor Zahn, in the introduction to his study of the legend of Cyprian, remarked: Dass altkirchliche Legenden den Sagenkreis bilden hiilfen, welcher sich um den geschichtlichen Doctor Johann Faustus von Knittlingen nach dessen Tod um 1540 zu bilden anfing und in der durch den Buchdrucker Johann Spies zu Frank- furt 1587 heraus gegebenen "Historia von D. Johann Fausten" zuerst schrift- liche Gestalt angenommen hat, ist allgemein anerkannt. Aber in Bezug auf des Einzelne findet man bei den Githeforschern eine grosse Unsicherheit und fessor John A. Walz, "A German Faust-Play of the Sixteenth Century," GR, II, 1 ff. The extant Faust play, Professor Walz's discovery, which he discusses in this article is shown by him to have no connection with Marlowe. 8 Thus Robert Petsch, in the Introduction to his edition of Goethe's Faust (Leipzig, 1925), p. 11. Petsch discusses briefly the Acts of Peter and the Clementines as materials for the Simon Magus legend, but treats the latter as generic prototype only. 9 Palmer and More, Sources, etc. Cf. n. 2 above. 84</page><page sequence="4">Beatrice Daw Brown die Theologen, welche den Gegenstand beriihrten, haben auffallende wenig Nei- gung gezeigt, bessere aus den Quellen, d.h. aus der altkirchlichen Literatur- geschipfte Kenntnis zu verbreiten.l1 On the basis of limited, but accurate, citation of evidence, Zahn affirmed a specific influence in two respects upon the Faust legend from the Simon Magus tradition.1 The findings of Zahn were rejected by Kuno Fischer in 1887 in the course of his discussion of Goethe's Faust.l2 Fischer's reply consisted mainly of emphatic denials; it advanced no new argument, and did not in any genuine sense re-examine the evidence adduced by Zahn; but it had the effect of tabling indefinitely the matter of Simon Magus in connection with the Faust legend. The pronouncement ore rotundo, how- ever, although effectual in silencing discussion, has never settled a prob- lem. And inasmuch as in this instance judgment was based on a limited body of evidence, constituting only a fraction of the relevant data, the material may be submitted in somewhat fuller extent than heretofore. There is further justification for re-examining the problem in the growing recognition, on the part of scholars, of the importance of patris- tic materials as ultimate sources. It is more than fifty years since Fischer, censuring Zahn for going far afield for indications of borrowing on the part of the Faust-legend, declared: Wir sehen hier eines jener Beispiele vor uns, wie unrichtig die entwickelungs- geschichtliche Methode gebraucht wird, wenn dem Dichter Entlehnungen ohne jede in seinem eigenen Vorstellungskreise nachweisbare Spur zugeschrieben oder angekiinstelt werden. And in the course of these fifty years repeated proof has come forward that patristic writings, far from being in a "Vorstellungskreise" remote from popular narrative, have been a very storehouse and treasury for themes of mediaeval fiction surviving into the Renaissance. The present paper, then, reaffirms the thesis of Zahn and earlier scholars in regard to the dependence of the literary tradition of Faust on certain elements in the legend of Simon Magus, and exhibits further evidence in support of this hypothesis. Obviously, however, this matter demands investigation on a far larger scale than is feasible within the limits of an article. I have confined myself to the adducing of such evi- dence as cements the earlier association of the Faust and Simon Magus legends in order to support and clarify the discussion of a direct influence from certain documents of the Simon Magus legend on Dr. Faustus. 10 Cyprian von Antiochien und die deutsche Faustsage (Erlangen, 1882), pp. 10-11. 11 Ibid., p. 46. 12 Goethe's Faust nach seiner Entstehung, Idee und Composition (Stuttgart, 1887), pp. 37-52. 85</page><page sequence="5">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus 1. Materials of the Simon Magus legend.-Simon Magus was a historical figure, a native of Samaria, who in the first century A.D. expounded a popularized version of Gnostic philosophy.l3 The Gnostics were a syn- cretic sect, or group of sects, whose doctrines, built around a central mystery, appear to have influenced early Christian teachings and in turn been influenced by them. With these inter-relationships, well as as with the esoteric core of Gnosticism, we are not here directly concerned. The aspects of the sect with which Simon Magus is especially identified are those commonly associated with Gnostic teaching-a rationalist criticism of the basis of Christian faith as derived from Scripture, and a theology, in part arising from this, which regarded the Creator of the physical universe as a kind of minor deity, the Demiurge, not omnipotent or wholly benevolent, different in essential nature from the mysterious principle of being which is not to be apprehended through ordinary avenues of sense. It is apparent that a serious and lofty philosophy animated much of Gnostic thought; but a complete and trustworthy reconstruction of the system is impossible, inasmuch as few direct records of its earlier and presumptively purer state remain. Most of our knowledge of early Gnosticism is based on the testimony, naturally biassed, of the early Church. And as to the Fathers of primitive Chris- tianity the doctrines of the Gnostics were blackest heresy, so their ex- ponent, Simon Magus, is represented by them as arch-heretic and archblasphemer. He undoubtedly had a large following, and bore the reputation of a Samaritan Messiah. Hence in the view of early Christian writers he was the epitome of evil, the "false Christ." On the basis of propagandist documents emanating from a hostile source, obviously we cannot hope to derive an accurate historical like- ness of Simon Magus. But for the student of legend, the reputed career and character of a hero are of more significance than the actual, since it is inevitably the popularized version of biography which most widely affects currents of thought and imagination. From this angle we are fortunate in having a graphic, if unsympathetic, record of Simon in certain patristic treatises, largely narrative in character, which take into account not only his activities as a heretical teacher and his pretensions 13 For a general account of Simon Magus in relation to Gnostic philosophy and the early Church, see the scholarly article by G. L. N. Hall in Hastings' Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics. Dr. Hall comments, "The story of Simon Magus survived in the popular myth- ology of the Middle Ages and contributed some elements to the legend of Faust." See also the discussion of Gnostic philosophy in relation to other systems of thought in Wilhelm Moeller, History of the Christian Church, translated by Andrew Rutherfurd (New York, 1892), pp. 129-155. Especially useful also are the editorial notes appended to the account of Simon in Eusebius' Church History, Bk. ii, Chapters xmii, xiv (ed. Rev. A. C.

Of major importance among these documents are the apocryphal Acts of Peter and Paul'4 and two treatises (closely related), attributed to Clement of Rome-the Homiliesl6 and the Recognitions.'6 The Acts of Peter and Paul is a comparatively brief narrative of the experiences of these two disciples at the court of Nero, and includes a lively account of a competition in miracles between Peter and Simon Magus. This document lies behind the Vita of Peter which was even- tually included in the Legenda Aurea;l7 and the materials dealing with Simon Magus which it includes were thus given wide circulation. The two pseudo-Clementine pieces have much in common and are, according to accepted opinion, based on a common original. They record a series of public disputes between Simon Magus and Peter, interwoven toward the close with the didactic romance of Clement, whose father was before his conversion a disciple of Simon.18 This situation in which Simon figures, later included in the Vita of St. Clement, was put into wide circulation through the medium of collections of Saints' Lives, particu- larly the Legenda Aurea.'1 Other accounts of Simon, dealing in more or less detail with his reputation for magical performance and his blas- phemous philosophy, are to be found in the writings of various Church Fathers, notably Hippolytus, Eusebius, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian. All these patristic writers, who contribute a variety of incident and 14 For bibliography see the Bibliographical Synopsis, Ante-Nicene Library, Vol. Ix.

Their intent is to present a picture of Simon as a dangerous heretic and an iniquitous charlatan, who by means of demonic aid appears to perform trivial and often malicious miracles and who in personal character is sensual and base. It is easy to reconstruct from their expressions the concept of Simon which passed into currency in the Middle Ages and became fixed in tradition-a cunning magician, in league with the powers of evil; a lecher and a blasphemer. Yet, if these same treatises are read without any theological preoccupations, this con- cept appears as conventional fagade, behind which may be glimpsed the heroic outline of a man of dynamic personal quality, intellectually keen, and gifted with a magnetic capacity for leadership. The very fervency of the efforts of pious writers to destroy him testifies to the exceptional strength of personality which rendered him a formidable antagonist. For the modern reader, impersonal in his interest in the documents, there appears then a double image of Simon Magus-a primary image, heroic in scale, and a secondary image, seen from the oblique angle of hostility, contempt, and fear, which appears as distorted and reduced in scale. This secondary image, propagated with the almost omnipotent force of the church, became for generations of Christians the true Simon Magus. Whether a literary history of Simon under his own name was ever made from these scattered accounts must be left to speculation: in any case he was established in popular tradition as a picturesque and sinister figure, pursuing a career of spectacular villainy to its catastrophic close. And the accounts themselves were available for any man of learning who might wish to compile the story, under any name, of an archmagician. 2. The Simon Magus Tradition and the "Historical Faust."-The Simon Magus legend appears to have been known to the "historical Faustus," in whom the modern Faust legend begins, inasmuch as it supplied him with a name. It will be recalled that the vagabond scholar who built up a reputation for wizardry in sixteenth-century Germany called himself-if we may believe a contemporary record-"Faustus iunior, magus secundus, chiromanticus, agromanticus, pyromanticus."20 The source of the appellation "Faustus iunior, magus secundus" has long been regarded as problematic. It is clear, from his use of the terms of comparison iunior and secundus, that Sabellicus assumed the name Faustus in imitation of some earlier magus who had borne it. Numerous instances of the name have been noted, but the majority of these offer no grounds for inferring a connection between an earlier and later Faust- us. There is, for example, nothing but common nomenclature to relate an undistinguished Bishop of Rheims to the notorious conjurer. In a 20 From the letter of Johannes Tritheim to Johannes Virdung, printed (with translation) by Palmer and More, Sources, pp. 83-86. 88</page><page sequence="8">Beatrice Daw Brown single instance only-and one which has been curiously disregarded- does the name Faustus connote a person and a situation strikingly appropriate to the German magician. This is the Faustus who, according to the Homilies of pseudo-Clement, was one of the followers of Simon Magus, and was on one occasion transformed by the magician into his own likeness, so that many were deceived into thinking him the original Magus himself.21 21 Cf. Horn., xx, Ch. xII, "Faustus appears to his friends with the face of Simon." The sons of Faustus (Clement's brothers) report the occurrence thus: " ... our father came in and caught Peter talking to us of him ... But we were amazed when we looked at him, for we saw the form of Simon, but heard the voice of our father Faustus. And when we were fleeing from him, and abhorring him, our father was astonished at receiving such harsh and hostile treatment from us. But Peter alone saw his natural shape, and said to us: 'Why do you in horror turn away from your own father?' But we and our mother said: 'It is Simon that we see before us, with the voice of our father.' And Peter said: 'You recognize only his voice, which is unaffected by magic; but as my eyes also are unaffected by magic I can see his form as it really is, that he is not Simon, but your father Faustus.' Then, looking to my father, he said: 'It is not your own true form that is seen by them, but that of Simon, our deadliest foe, and a most impious man'." Peter promises to restore Faustus eventually to his own shape, but evolves a plan through which in the meantime the metamorphosis, with its consequent confusion of the identities of Simon Magus and Faustus, can be used to confound the magician. In accordance with this plan Faustus, im- personating Simon, publicly retracts the latter's accusations of Peter, and declares, "For I confess to you I am a magician, I am a deceiver, I am a juggler. Yet perhaps it is possible for me by repentance to wipe out the sins which were formerly committed by me" (A-N L, viII, 343-345). Approximately the same story is told in the Recognitions, Book x, Chapters LIII-LXVII (pp. 207-210). Here, however, the names of the characters are transposed; the name of Clement's father, who is Simon's double, is given as Faustinianus, and Faustus is applied to one of Clement's brothers. This variation has given rise to considerable confusion on the part of commentators, some of whom assign the name Faustus, in its significant use as the appellation of a supposed magus, mistakenly to the Recognitions. The latter treatise, again, is the only one considered in the useful discussion of the derivation of the name Faustus by Dr. E. Cushing Richardson, in the Papers of the American Society of Church History, vI, 133-145 (1893). Dr. Richardson notes that a source in the Recognitions for the name Faustus was alluded to by Lagarde in the Prolegomena to his edition of the Clementines in 1865, and that Lagarde's conclusions were discussed by later scholars (cf. his Note 22). Dr. Richardson's paper is referred to in a footnote to an article by Professor Alfred Richards, "Some Faustus Notes," MLN, xxII, 39-41; but Professor Richards makes no reference in his text to Dr. Richardson's conclusions. Palmer and More cite only the Recognitions, without comment on the names. The significance of the name of the early Faustus was recognized by Harold G. Meek, in his volume Johann Faustus, the Man and the Myth (Oxford University Press, 1930). Dr. Meek says, "It was this Faustus whom Simon Magus changed in form and face so that he became Simon Magus' double and that men could not tell them apart. For a dealer in magic and spells, no better name was offering than Faustus iunior magus secundus et aeromanticus (sic) with its ready-made associations and its possibilities of passing-off." Dr. Meek errs, however, in assigning the name Faustus in this application to the Recog- nitions. 89</page><page sequence="9">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus This original for the name of "Faustus iunior" was affirmed in 1882 by Th. Zahn, who was impressed by its aptness for the uses of a later Magus: Auch der vom Vater auf den Sohn sich forterbende Name Faustus nimmt in dem clementinischen Roman, durch welchem hauptsachlich die Erinnerung an Simon Magus durchs Mittelalter hindurch erhalten blieb, eine bedeutsame Stellung ein. So heisst namlich der Vater des Clemens und seiner Briuder, Faustinus und Faustinianus, ein Mann, der in Folge schweren Familienungliicks astrologischem Aberglauben anheimfallt und zur Leugnung Gottes und der gottlichen Vorsehung kommt. Dazu kommt noch, dass dieser Faustus durch Wirkung der Zauberkiinste des Simon Magus zeitweilig die Ziige des Gesichts und der Gestalt des Simon Magus an sich tragen muss. Der name Faustus ist also einer der Faden wodurch die geschichtliche Gestalt des Dr. Faustus mit der alten Simonssage verkniipft wurde.22 The position of Zahn was vehemently assailed by Fischer in his discus- sion referred to above. Fischer refused to admit that between the pseudo- magician Faustus, who was the double of the first magus, and "Faustus iunior magus secundus" there is any connecting thread: Verfolgen wir den Weg zur Auffindung solchen Faust-genealogien noch einen Schritt weiter. Iustus Faustus erbt von seinem Vater den Namen Faustus. Nichts ist natiirlicher. Auch der vom Vater auf den Sohn forter bende Name Faustus soil nach Zahns Auffassung der deutschen Faustsage aus der Simonsage stammen, denn in der clementinischen Legenden heisst der Vater des Clemens "Faustus" und seine Briider Faustinus und Faustinianus. "Der Name Faustus ist also auch einer der Fliden, wodurch die geschichtliche Gestalt des Dr. Faustus mit der alten Simonsage verkniipft wurde." Ich sehe weder den Faden noch die Faiden. Wenn der Held unserer Faustsage eine geschichtliche Person dieses Namens war, so ist der letztere in der Sage zur Geniige erklart. Ob der Name Faustus tiberhaupt aus der Simonsage stammt, ist fraglich; ob der name un seres Faust von dort entlehnt ist, noch fraglicher; gewiss aber ist, dass die Vorge- schichte des blossen Namens nichts iiber den Zusammenhang der beiden Sagen ausmacht.23 What springs to the eye, in the above citation, is the suppression- whether deliberate or absentminded-of the significant item in Zahn's discussion; namely, the fact that the original Faustus was, like the later, a magus and was closely associated with the most famous magus of legend. Fischer has, instead, brought to the surface in derision the wholly incidental circumstance that this Faustus was the father of St. Clement -an item which Zahn had quite properly presented as a detail of de- scriptive background. In consequence, it is made to appear that Zahn was concerned merely with "die Vorgeschichte des blossen Namens," a 90 22 Op. cit., p. 12. u1 Op. cit., p. 45.</page><page sequence="10">Beatrice Daw Brown casual parallel in an obscure patristic document, whereas the distin- guishing value of his contribution is that he affirmed, not only an original for the name Faustus, but an original with a significant association. The contemporary legend of the "historical Faust," as it may be assembled from scattered items recorded in documents of the period, appears to owe little to the legend of Simon Magus. Apart from allegedly biographical data, most of the allusions to Faustus have the generic quality of the folk-tale of magic. A signal exception, however, is to be noted. Melancthon couples the name of Faustus with that of Simon in recording a feat of magic attempted by both magicians with the same disastrous result. There [in the presence of Nero] Simon Magus tried to fly to heaven, but Peter prayed that he might fall. I believe that the Apostles had great struggles al- though not all are recorded, Faust also tried this at Venice, But he was sorely dashed to the ground.24 It is clear, then, that to a sixteenth-century humanist there was nothing strange in the juxtaposing of the two conjurers; and the definite indebt- edness of the later legend to the earlier in this instance is, I believe, generally accepted. It is not questioned by Fischer.26 3. The Simon Magus Tradition and the Faustbooks.-The legend of Simon was, then, known to the sixteenth-century scholar who called himself "Faustus Iunior magus secundus," and to Melancthon. Both the popular version propagated by the Legenda Aurea and the literary version represented by the Clementines were in circulation at this period. 24 "Ibi [coram Nerone] Simon Magus subuolare in caelum: sed Petrus precatus est vt decideret. Credo Apostolos habuisse magna certamina, etiamsi non omnia sunt scripta. Faustus Venetiis etiam hoc tentauit. Sed male allisus solo." From the Explicationes Melancthonie, cf. Palmer and More, Sources, p. 99. Although the incident does not re- appear in the Volksbuch, Faustus is therein credited with the power of flight. A second parallel between the contemporary legend of Faust and the tradition of Simon also is referable to Melancthon, though indirectly. In the Christliche Bedenken it is reported that Faust addressed Melancthon thus: "One of these days, when you go to the table I will bring it about that all the pots in your kitchen will fly out of the chimney." (Palmer and More, Sources, p. 122.) This recalls one of the alleged performances of Simon: "In his house he makes dishes be seen as borne of themselves to wait upon him, no bearers being seen" (Homilies, IT, xxxii; A-N L, vm, 235). There is a reflection of this in the prose Historie; see n. 23 below. 26 With reference to this point Fischer says: "Hier liegt die Vergleichung der beiden Zauberer so nahe dass sie mit Handen zu greifen war und schon in einer Schrift die dem altesten Faustbuche vorherging ausgesprochen wurde" (op. cit., p. 41). The story of Simon's frustrated flight, which is told in the Acts of Peter, was probably the most widely known of all legendary incidents related of him. It was a frequent subject for painters of the Italian Renaissance (cf. pp. 108-109 below). The incident will be further discussed in this paper in relation to Marlowe. 91</page><page sequence="11">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus They would, presumably, have been available to the scholar or scholars who set out to construct a consecutive narrative of the adventures of a contemporary sorcerer, and it would be matter for surprise if such a narrative revealed no traces of the great sorcerer of antiquity. One or two points of contact between the two traditions have, in fact, been pointed out and to an extent accepted. The significance of these, how- ever, has not been fully recognized, and to them may be added a number of similarities pointing to a relationship of dependence on the part of the compilers of the Faustbooks. As one or two commentators have noted, both Faustus and Simon make a journey to Rome, and perform miracles before the Emperor.26 In the case of the Continental magician the original situation necessarily divides into two, as he journeys to Rome to visit the Pope and seeks out the Emperor at Innsbruck. The parallel in narrative plan is, however, unmistakable, and becomes important as surrounding and thereby strengthening parallels of incident occurring within this setting. A second point of likeness which has been noted but inadequately considered is the association of both Faustus and Simon with Helen of Troy. As with the origin of the name Faustus, mention of this similarity has been for the most part tentative and sporadic.27 It was affirmed by Zahn, who perceived more than a surface similarity in the two situations, but unreservedly rejected by Fischer; and since that time commentators have either ignored it or treated it as coincidence. But the parallel, challenging in itself, derives special force from a consideration hitherto unnoted-the dual character presented in both the earlier and the later tradition of Helen herself. Like the magician, she presents the paradox of heavenly and low, spiritual and earthy, in strange union. It will be re- called that in the Historie the magician evokes the phantom of Helen, whom the students esteem "rather to be a heauenly than an earthly 26 The locus classicus for the account of Simon at the court of Nero is, as has been said, the Acts of Peter. There is some variation in patristic accounts; according to Justin Martyr, the visit of Simon to the Imperial court took place in the reign of Claudius (First Apology, A-N L , I171). This is possibly the source of the statement of Eusebius to the same effect (Church History, ed. cit., p. 114). Since most medieval versions are based ultimately on the Acts of Peter, the court of Nero became the traditional setting. 27 Cf. G. L. N. Hall in the article referred to above (n. 10): "Faastus, like Simon, enjoyed the companionship of Helen of Troy." Dr. E. C. Richardson, in the article referred to above, noted that Lagarde, in his Prolegomena, took account of the Helena parallel, and his conclusions were enlarged upon by Steitz in a review of Lagarde in the Studien u. Kritikien in 1867. The connection with the Clementines was "approved" by Erich Schmidt in the Goethe Jahrbuch for 1882. Schaff (Church Hist., II, 442) notes the resemblance in the name Faustus and the association with Helena, but is skeptical as to possible relationship. Cf. also Meek (op. cit., p. 92): "There is much in this episode [sc. the account of Faust's relations with Helen] which sounds like a memory of the tales told of Simon Magus." 92</page><page sequence="12">Beatrice Daw Brown creature" and "perswaded themselves she was a spirit." Yet, at the same time she shows "a rouling Haukeseye" "a smiling &amp; wanton counte- nance,"28 and a little later Faust made her "his common concubine and bed-fellow."29 This strange juxtaposition of spiritual and sensual in Helen lends itself readily, of course, to subjective interpretation, as symbolizing two currents in the Renaissance; but, less fancifully, the dualism in the treatment of Helen in the Faustbook is seen to reflect directly the blending of two traditions of Helen in her association with Simon Magus. According to Gnostic doctrine, Helen of Troy was an embodiment of pure spirit. She was one in a series of incarnations of a female principle emanating in primal essence from Deity.30 The Homilies presents this spiritualized concept of Helen, discrediting it as being the creation of Simon: But Simon is going about in company with Helena, and even till now, as you see, is stirring up the people. And he says that he has brought down this Helena from the highest heavens to the world; being queen, as the all-bearing being, and wisdom, for whose sake, says he, the Greeks and barbarians fought, having before their eyes but an image of truth.31 But according to other authority, Simon's companion was Helen rein- carnated as a prostitute.32 The account given by Hippolytus reflects the merging of an esoteric theory of metempsychosis into the popular notion of Helen, the paramour of the lustful Simon: She, always abiding among women, confounded the powers in the world by reason of her surpassing beauty. Whence, likewise, the Trojan war arose on her account. For in the Helen born at this time resided this Intelligence... sub- sequently she stood on the roof of a house in Tyre, a city in Phcenicia, and on going down thither [Simon professed to have] found her.... But the filthy fel- low, becoming enamoured of this miserable woman called Helen, purchased her as his slave and enjoyed her person.3 28 Ch. 45; Palmer and More, p. 11. The Volksbuch has: "so wundersch6n dass die Studenten nit wusten ob sie bey ihnen selbsten weren oder nit, so verwirrt und innbrun- stig waren sie"; and "Mit sch6nen Kollschwartzen augen, ein vberauss schon gleissend Angesicht sie sahe sich allenthalben in der Stuben vmb, mit gar frechem und bibischem Gesicht, dass die Studenten gegen jr in Liebe entzundet waren."

See also Lecky, History of Rationalism in Europe, I, 220 ff. 31 A-N L, viii, 233; Migne, Patrol. Gr., II, 94. It should be noted that Simon's companion is called "Luna" in the Recognitions. This name has been explained as resulting from a confusion of Helena with the moon-goddess Selene. 32 Cf. Eusebius, Church History, ed. cit., p. 114; see especially note 12 for numerous references in patristic works to the relationship of Helen and Simon. 33 The Refutation of All Heresies, Bk. vi, Ch. xIv; A-N L, v, 80. This treatise is an es- pecially valuable primary source for early Christian interpretation of Simon's philosophy. 93</page><page sequence="13">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus Tertullian offers the fullest statement of the extraordinary confusion of ideas centering in Helen of Troy and Simon Magus: Besides the support with which his own magic arts furnished him, he [sc. Simon] had recourse to imposture, and purchased a Tyrian woman of the name of Helen out of a brothel, with the same money which he had offered for the Holy Spirit,-a traffic worthy of the wretched man. He actually feigned himself to be the Supreme Father, and further pretended that the woman was his own primary conception, wherewith he had purposed the creation of the angels and the archangels; that after she was possessed of this purpose she sprang forth from the Father and descended to the lower spaces and ... was degraded even to the form of man, to be confined, as it were, in the bonds of the flesh. Having during many ages wallowed about in one female shape and another, she became the notorious Helen who was so ruinous to Priam.... After wandering about in this way from body to body, she, in her final disgrace, turned out a viler Helen still as a professional prostitute. This wench, therefore, was the lost sheep, upon whom the Supreme Father, even Simon, descended.... O hapless Helen, what a hard fate is yours between the poets and the heretics, who have blackened your fame sometimes with adultery, sometimes with prosti- tution! Only her rescue from Troy is a more glorious affair than her extrication from the brothel. There were a thousand ships to withdraw her from Troy; a thousand pence were probably more than enough to withdraw her from the stews.34 The reappearance of Helen of Troy in conjunction with the magician in the Faust legend is, then, more than an instance of casual borrowing. It is a clue to the genesis of the legend in a dual tradition which had become popularized in the degraded form established by the Church but which retained some suggestion of original aspects of sublimity. That all these patristic accounts of the union of Simon with Helen of Troy were known to the compiler or compilers of the Volksbuch it would be rash to assert. Regularly, however, arresting and picturesque elements in learned accounts of a hero are taken over into popular tradition; and the extent to which popular and learned sources are fused in the mediae- val Faust-story it is impossible to determine. Zahn, in discussing the situation, stresses the point that Simon's companion, though a spirit, passed for an actual incarnation of Helen of Troy: Simon's Buhlerin Helena ist ebenso wie des Faustus ein aus der anderen Weld auf diese Erde gekommenes Wesen; hier wie dort ist sie es, deren Schonheit einst den trojanischen Krieg veranlasst hat. Die Identitat dieser Gestalten kann doch dadurch nicht in Frage gestellt werden, dass Simon Magus einmal sagt, die Griechen und Trojaner hatte nur um ein Phantom der inzwischen beim Hochsten 34 Treatise on the Soul, Ch. xxxiv, A-N L, III, 215. This passage is apparently an emotion- alized version of material in Irenaeus, Against Heresies, A-N L, I, 348. 94</page><page sequence="14">Beatrice Daw Brown Gott weilenden Helena gestritten, wahrend nach anderer Darstellung die Helena des Trojanerkriegs eine wirkliche Incarnation jener iibergeschichtlichen Helena sein soll.35 He disclaims vigorously the notion that Faust's union with Helen is a sixteenth-century "invention." Alles was man iiber eine Entstehung der Gestalt der Helena aus Ideen der Renaissance sagt gleichviel ob geistreich oder nicht, ist einfach falsch, weil es auf der irrigen Voraussetzung beruht, dass die Verbindung des Magiers mit Helena eine Erfindung des 16 Jahrhunderts sei. Sie gehort vielmehr dem ersten spat- estens dem zweiten Jahrhundert an.3 Fischer, in his reply, registers an unshakable difference of opinion, "Dies ist nun meine Ansicht gar nicht," and alleges that Zahn's affirma- tion is more easily made than proved: Solche Behauptungen sind weit leichter gemacht als bewiesen, und es ist gerath- ener sie zu priufen als ohne weiteres zu bejahen. Der Faust der Sage wie der Goetsche'schen vermahlt sich mit der homerischen Helena, der griechischen Heldenfrau.37 The proof which he submits for his own opinion is wholly assertive: die Genossin des Simon eine gnostische Figur ist, aus der erst die willkiirlichste allegorische Deutung die homerische Helena hat hervorgehen lassen. Diese ist ein Jahrtausend alter als die gnostische und aller Weld bekannt, wahrend die letztere dem Vortellungskreise sowohl der Faustsage als der Goethe'schen Dich- tung vollig fremd ist.?8 Since this pronouncement, although offering no direct proof in support of Fischer's position, has undoubtedly been in great part responsible for the almost universal neglect of Simon's Helen of Troy, it calls for somewhat close examination. One is struck in the first place by a somewhat misleading omission. Fischer ignores the circumstance which gives point and force to the parallel adduced by Zahn; namely, the fact that in both the Faust- legend and the Simon-legend Helen of Troy is introduced as the flesh- and-blood paramour of a conjurer-a rl6e quite alien to that of the "Heldenfrau" of the Iliad. Fischer, rejecting this parallel as coincidence, must assume that the compiler of the Faust-legend, in ignorance of the original situation uniting a magician and Helen, recreated it with the same heroine, taken from a very different setting. This would seem even 35 Op. cit., p. 11.-Zahn refers to the inaugural dissertation of E. F. Sommer, De Theophili cum diabolo foedere (Halle, 1844), wherein the "borrowing" of Helen of Troy from the Simon Magus legend is asserted. 36 Op. cit., p. 12. 7 Op. cit., p. 42. 38 Ibid., p. 43. 95</page><page sequence="15">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus more remarkable coincidence. And, in obscuring the significant element in the parallel, he stresses the aspect of the patristic Helen in which she seems most remote from the later story-her function as an allegorical figure expressing Gnostic thought. But, as has been noted, this represents only the Helen of learned tradition; the vulgar tradition, running current with it, insists upon Simon's kept wanton who provides a prototype for Faustus' "common concubine and bedfellow." These two characters were fused in the person of Simon's companion, and this fusion, or con- fusion, of identities must inevitably have emerged in popular rendering of the legend. At the same time, the allegorical interpretation of Helen of Troy has its own importance with reference to the evolution of the Faust story. One cannot dogmatize as to points or areas of contact, and certainly, at the stage at which the Faust materials were worked over into the Volksbuch, there seems little tendency to allegorize the damsel "mit gar frechem und bubischem Gesicht," who had disturbing effect on Faust's fellow-students. But the allegorizing of Faust's union with Helen, a favorite tendency of modern criticism, can hardly be separated from the earlier current in the same stream. The most familiar expression of the allegory is doubtless the fine passage in Symonds' History of the Renaissance in Italy: Faustus is, therefore, a parable of the impotent yearnings of the human spirit in the Middle Ages-its passionate aspiration, its conscience-striken desire, its fettered curiosity, and the cramping limits of imperfect knowledge and irra- tional dogmatism. The indestructible beauty of Greek art, whereof Helen was the element, became through the discovery of classic poetry and sculpture the possession of the modern world. Mediaevalism took Helen to wife, and their off- spring, the Euphorion of Goethe's drama, is the spirit of the modern world.39 It is interesting to place beside this a statement of the accepted allegor- ical interpretation of Simon's union with Helena-a statement formu- lated, in this instance, by an authority on Gnostic thought. Thus in Simon and Helena there is mythically or typically set forth the eman- cipation of the human spirit (which is of divine origin) from the bonds of fini- tude, which fundamentally completes itself everywhere under different names.40 Moeller has not, so far as I know, commented anywhere on the Faust- legend, and certainly has no axe to grind in connection with its sources. But the early allegory of Simon and Helena, thus objectively reported, is seen to foreshadow, in essentials, the symbolism of the Faust and Helen of the Renaissance. Further, Professor Fischer argues that for Faust's Helen the sole prototype is the "homerische Helen," since "diese ist ein Jahrtausend a9 II, 37. 40 Wilhelm Moeller, op. cit., p. 133. 96</page><page sequence="16">Beatrice Daw Brown iilter als die gnostische und aller Weld bekannt." Admittedly, Homeric literature is older than the Clementines, but after considerable puzzling I cannot see that this in any way affects the issue. And conceding that the Iliad may have been known to all the world in the sixteenth century, other stories were known as well. The keystone of Fischer's argument, however, is his statement that the story of Simon lies in a "Vorstellungskreise" wholly foreign to the "Faustsage." The divergence is surely not as wide as it seemed to Professor Fischer, who looked upon the Clementines as obscure theolog- ical treatises rather than as a matrix of mediaeval fiction. Even if we consider only the learned accounts of Simon-setting aside the uncon- trollable ways of popular tradition-the didactic romance of Clement, enlivened with anecdotes of a famous magician, does not seem "v6llig fremd" in genre to a compilation of the adventures of a magician framed with a strong didactic intent. In any case, Fischer's argument is reducible to a strong conviction that a sixteenth-century story teller would not have known the story of Simon Magus. In the face of such a conviction, it is in place to exhibit with some fullness the internal evidence of like- ness between the two legends, which can be interpreted only as indicat- ing a relationship of dependence or as an extraordinary series of coinci- dences. If we clear our minds of the mass of incidental detail in both legends which interferes with perspective and look at the large narrative scheme, we find that the careers of Simon and Faustus follow essentially the same pattern. An extraordinarily bold and powerful magician, defying God, performs a series of wonders, many of them before the Emperor and at Rome, "having the devil as his servant."41 In the end he meets a violent death as punishment for his audacity.42 41 The phrase is taken from the Acts of Peter (A-N L, viiI, 480), but the notion that Simon received diabolic aid of course underlies all accounts of his conjuring activities. 42 This conclusion for the career of Simon Magus is that which stands in the popular account derived from the Acts of Peter and popularized through the Legenda Aurea. According to the original account in the Acts of Peter, "he fell into a place called Sacra Via, that is, Holy Way, and was divided into four parts, having perished by an evil fate" (A-N L, vIII, 484). The version in Caxton's Englishing of the Legenda is slightly different; here it is reported that he "brake his neck and head and he died there forthwith" (Palmer and More, Sources, p. 40). The longer of the two metrical versions which are included in the Northern Homily Collection follows the Acts of Peter in the point of the quartering of the magician's body, "In foure peces his body brast," but adds a new legendary touch: And nowper war pai fless ne bone Bot ilkone like to a flint-stone.- And so Pai dwell euer als a merk, Forto bere witnes of pat werk. Cf. Horstmann, Altenglische Legenden, Neue Folge (Heilbronn, 1881), pp. 70-71.-Accord- 97</page><page sequence="17">98 Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus It is true, of course, that many other stories of mortals using diabolic aid circulated in the Middle Ages. Of these, one in particular is known to have exerted an important influence on the Faust-story and is sometimes loosely referred to as the source of the plot. This is the legend of The- ophilus, the sixth-century Bishop in Cilicia who sold his soul to the devil in return for assistance toward mundane advancement and sealed the compact with his blood.43 That the theme of blood compact in the Faust- books was taken over directly from this legend is admitted even by Fischer, who is in this instance not disturbed by the remoteness of "Vorstellungskreise."44 This incident is the characteristic and identifying contribution of the Theophilus legend, but other elements in the Faust story may likewise be referable to the Theophilus tradition.45 ing to the shorter version of the same piece in the collection, Simon "fell &amp; brast in- sondere / And his saule went to hell wi? thondir" (ibid., p. 80). The very early Constitutions of the Holy Apostles gives a somewhat different account of the catastrophe from that in the Acts of Peter; according to this the magician was not killed, but "violently dashed against the ground, and had his hip and ankle-bones broken" (A-N L, vnI, 453). Arnobius reports that he fell from a height, to "lie prostrate with his legs broken" and later, "worn out with anguish and shame, cast himself down from the roof of a very lofty house" (A-N L, vI, 438). These several accounts of a violent death involving dismemberment and the breaking of bones approximate in varying degree the description of the death of Faustus in the Historie: "They found his body lying on the horse dung, most monstrously torne, and fearfull to beholde, for his head and all his ioynts were dashed to pieces" (Palmer and More, p. 230). A variant account of the death of Simon is given by Hippolytus, who records that Simon had himself buried alive in the expectation of rising on the third day; "whereas," according to the chronicler, "he remained in that grave to this day" (A-N L, v, 81). This story seems not to have passed into circulation. The Homilies and Recognitions have nothing to say as to the manner of Simon's death. 43 A number of versions of the Theophilus legend are printed by George Webbe Dasent, Theophilus in Icelandic, Low German and Other Tongues (London, 1845). This collection includes the version in the Legenda Aurea (ed. cit., pp. 593-594). Caxton's Englishing of the latter, together with the much ampler account given by Paulus Diaconus, is printed by Palmer and More, pp. 60-67. These editors discuss the growth of the Theophilus legend and give bibliography. They do not mention, however, the highly important English poem of the fifteenth century, semi-dramatic in form, which was printed by Heuser (Engl. Stud., xxxII, 1-23). The significance of this piece in relation to the Faust tradition was pointed out by Gerould (Saints' Legends, pp. 253-254). In this connection should also be considered the Middle English poem Celestin, which combines with the Theophilus narra- tive the typically Faustian motivation of desire for superhuman knowledge. (For the text, with discussion, cf. Horstmann, Anglia, I, 55-85; for further comment, cf. Gerould, op. cit., pp. 228--229.) 44 "In der Theophilussage-bildet der schriftliche Vertrag mit dem Teufel ein wesent- liches Merkmal das zur Vergleichung mit der Faustsage gedient hat" (op. cit., p. 58). 45 This possibility is categorically denied by Fischer, in spite of the leading clue offered by the blood-compact: "Bis auf jenes schriftliche Pactum giebt es keinen charakteristischen Vergleichungspunkt zwischen der Sage vom Theophilus und der vom Faust, weshalb jene</page><page sequence="18">Beatrice Daw Brown The scenes of revelry with Mephistopheles in a castle, described in Chapter 22 of the Historie, may have been suggested by a kindred situa- tion such as stands in a Low German version of the Theophilus legend described by Dasent.46 In another dramatic Low German version, the hero holds conversations with the devil,47 and is exhorted by a pious person to repentance.48 The Penitentia Theophili, again, offers a striking similarity in narrative situation to the Faust story; in it the hero, believ- ing himself about to be damned, utters frenzied lamentation much in the vein of Faustus' last agony of despair. Faustus cries: Oh who can deliuer me out of these fearful tormenting flames, the which I see prepared for me: Oh there is no helpe, nor any man that can deliuer me, nor any wayling of sins can help me, neither is there rest to be found for me day nor night. Ah wo is me, for there is no help for me, no shield, no defence, no com- fort. Where is my hold: knowledge dare I not trust: and for a soule to God wards that haue I not, for I shame to speake unto him: if I doo, no answere shall be made me, but hee will hide his face from me, to the ende that I shoulde not be- holde the ioyes of the chosen. What meane I then to complaine where no helpe is: No, I know no hope resteth in my gronings. I haue desired that it should bee so, and God hath sayd Amen to my misdoings: for now I must haue shame to comfort me in my calamities.49 Theophilus likewise, in a rhetorical monologue, compares his own future with that of the blest, bewails the futility of looking for help where no help is, and at the close, laments the depth to which he has fallen: Why have I sought for the sake of vain glory and empty fame to consign my wretched soul to Gehenna? What aid shall I pray for, who am cheated of aid by the devil? . . . Woe to me, what shall I do? To whom shall I go? What shall I say in that hour when the just will be crowned while I will be condemned? . . . Who will pity me? Who will aid me? ... Verily no one.... Woe to me, miser- able one, who having stumbled and fallen into the abyss, am unable to rise.50 At this point, it will be recalled, the two stories diverge; Theophilus has a vision of the Virgin and repents, while Faustus, in the tradition of the unforgivable magician Simon, goes down to destruction. The legend of Theophilus,56 then, which makes a highly important contribution of nicht als der Vorbild oder die Quelle der letzteren anzusehen ist" (op. cit., p. 59). In view of the wide circulation of the legend of Theophilus in Germanic literatures (cf. Dasent, op. cit.) which testify to general knowledge of the tradition, it is surely arbitrary to limit the influence of this legend on the Faust tradition to a single indisputable instance of borrowing. 46 Op. cit., p. xxx. 47 Ibid., pp. 42-52. 48 Ibid., pp. 52-55; cf. Historie, Ch. 48. It should be noted, however, that for the anony- mous "old man" who admonishes Faustus in the Historie the prototype is provided by the Homilies (A-N L, vIII, 305 ff.). 49 Palmer and More, p. 225. 60 Ibid., pp. 65-66; for Latin original, cf. Dasent, op. cit., p. 69. 61 The relationships between certain of the versions of the Theophilus legend have been discussed by E. Fr. Sommer, op. cit. (cf. Note 35 below). 99</page><page sequence="19">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus incident and situation, was grafted upon the main stem of the Simon- Faustus narrative theme-the bold magician punished. Another patristic story which has been brought forward as a "fore- runner" of the Faustbooks is that of Cyprian. This legend, in the shorter version popularized by the Legenda Aurea, relates the attempt of the magician Cyprian aided by a demon to procure the virgin Justina for the nobleman Aglaidas. The attempt failed, and Cyprian was converted by Justina and eventually canonized.52 Obviously this story presents no specific relationship to the Faust narrative, except in the situation of the magician's use of demonic aid in his function as pander-the situation (modified) of Chapter 50 of the Historie, "How Dr. Faustus made a mar- riage between two lovers." Even this incident appears to stem from a tradition associated with Simon Magus, who "is possibly to be identified with a Jewish magician named Simon who acted as go-between for the procurator Felix of Judaea."53 The longer and less familiar version of the Cyprian story, the Confession,54 may have suggested the notion of the training of Dr. Faustus in magic and his study of the "Chaldean, Persian, Arabian and Greeke tongues," although even here is reminiscence of the Simon Magus history.65 Detailed comparison is not within present limits possible; but it would appear that the influence of the Cyprian legend was, apart from the derivative element, slight. To group it with the legends of Simon and Theophilus as "characteristic magus legends" the caption used by Palmer and More, gives it disproportionate emphasis and blurs the distinction between the individual contribution of the three legends.66 At the same time, it appears wholly probable that the familiar legend of Cyprian was known to the compilers of the Faust- books; and since this legend, like that of Theophilus, derives from patristic sources, it strengthens to that extent the case for Simon Magus. A compiler of the adventures of Faust cannot be allowed to have knowledge of Cyprian and Theophilus and denied knowledge of Simon Magus. 62 Caxton's Englishing of this version and of the related Justina is printed by Palmer and More, pp. 42-58; for discussion and bibliography, cf. pp. 41-42. 63 Cf. Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, s.v. Simon Magus. The source of the confusion is further suggested: "This Simon is described by Josephus as a Cypriot (Ant., xx, vii, 2), but this rests on a confusion of the Cyprian capital Cittium with the Samaritan village Gitta." There is further ground for the confusion of the two figures in the fact that many of Simon's miracles were performed at Antioch. Zahn rejects the theory that the legend of Cyprian sprang from that of Simon (op. cit., pp. 115-117). 54 A German translation of this is printed by Zahn, op. cit. 66 Simon is said to be well versed in the Greek literature (cf. Recognitions, II, x; A-N L, vIII, 299). 66 Large claims for an influence from Cyprian on the Faust tradition are made by Zahn, op. cit. 100</page><page sequence="20">Beatrice Daw Brown To resume: Of the three mediaeval stories only that of Simon Magus follows a narrative pattern prefiguring that of the Faust story. Whereas the legends of Theophilus and Cyprian illustrate the theme of the magician turned Christian, that of Simon Magus exemplifies the magician punished. The first two tales, both contributory to the original theme with punitive conclusion, circulated as Saints' legends: that of Simon Magus as perennial warning and example.67 In conjunction with this general narrative scheme the tradition of Simon, as we have noted, contains the two striking episodes: a journey to perform miracles before the Emperor and at Rome, and an amorous involvement with Helen of Troy. To these larger similarities may now be added a number of details, having to do both with the type of magical feat performed by the hero and with his qualities as scholar and philoso- pher, which further relate the Simon Magus tradition to the development of the Faust legend. The first group are referable to various patristic sources, and may be regarded as contributing to general popular tradi- tion; the latter are virtually all derived from the Homilies of pseudo- Clement, which has already been indicated as the source of the name Faustus applied to a conjurer, Simon's double, and of the name Helena for his companion. The magical powers which are promised Faustus in Chapter 18 of the Historie repeat in great part a similar series of prodigies ascribed to Simon in the Homilies. "Learne of mee, Faustus," says Mephistopheles, "to runne through wals, doores, and gates of stone and yron, to flie in the ayre like a bird, and to liue and nourish thyselfe in the fire like a Salamander."58 Of Simon, it was rumored that he "rolls himself on the 67 An exception must be noted in the scriptural account of Simon (Acts, viII, 9-13) where it is stated that Simon believed and was baptized. The effect of this statement is, however, largely negated by the verses immediately following, which describe the attempt of Simon to purchase the gift of the Holy Ghost with money and the rebuke of Peter to the effect that Simon is still in the "bond of iniquity." Virtually all allusions to Simon in vernacular literature present him as the father of simony, the false Christ, or a blasphemous magician. It is therefore surprising to find "Simon of Samaria" cited in the Volksbuch and Historie as an example of the sinner repenting before it is too late: "Wie jr sehet das Exempel in der Apostelgeschicht am. 8 Cap. von simony in Samaria, der auch viel Volcks verftihret hette, denn man hat jn sonderlich fur ein Gott gehalten und jn die Krafft Gottes, oder Simon Sanctus, genannt; diser war aber hernach auch bekehret als er die Predigt S. Philippi geh6rt liess er sich taiiffen"; cited by Zahn, op. cit., p. 11, from W. Braune's Abdruck des Faustbuchs (Halle, 1878), S. 93. This passage is the subject of an exchange of arguments between Zahn and Fischer which does not advance the position of either. The presence in the Faustbooks of a misleading allusion to the canonical account of Simon may be variously accounted for; in any case it does not appreciably modify the atmosphere of popular legend and fictive tradition which fills the Faustbooks. 58 Palmer and More, p. 161. This passage does not stand in the German text. 101</page><page sequence="21">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus fire and is not burnt; and sometimes he flies ... he opens lockfast gates; he melts iron."69 Other magical performances may be noted which have even more specific identifying character. For example, the power of moving dishes by invisible hands, of which Faustus makes effective use at the Pope's banquet,60 is also attributed to Simon in the series cited above: "In his house he makes dishes be seen as borne of themselves to wait upon him, no bearers being seen." Again, for Faustus' flaming vehicle, the "waggon-of light burning fire,"61 we find a prototype in that of Simon; it is reported by Arnobius that many "had seen the chariot of Simon Magus, and his fiery car."62 Finally, one of the most spectacular of the feats of Faustus, the evoking of spirits of the ancient dead, belongs also to Simon Magus and his followers. Tertullian laments: At this very time the heretical dupes of this same Simon (Magus) are so much elated by the extravagant pretensions of their art that they undertake to bring up from Hades the souls of the prophets themselves. And I suppose that they can do so under cover of a lying wonder.... God forbid, however, that we should suppose that the soul of any saint, much less of a prophet, can be dragged out of [its resting-place in Hades] by a demon.6 In keeping with the spirit of a humanistic age, the phantom of a secular hero of antiquity rather than a prophet is raised up by Faustus. These correspondences64 build up into a structural relationship the analogy, hitherto represented to be generic and remote, between Faustus the magician and Simon the magician. And it is solely as magi- cians that the two have hitherto been compared. But Faustus is of course much more than a dealer in magic; he is a scholar of trained intellect and inquiring mind. In this aspect he has been seen by critics as the embodi- ment of the humanistic spirit. But, making due allowance for the Zeit- geist, we should recognize that Faustus the philosopher, in his training, mental interests and point of view repeats, on a limited scale, Simon Magus, the philosopher. The Homilies supply ample data for this aspect of Simon Magus, who reveals in his disputes with Peter a background 69 Hom., II, Ch. xxxII; A-N L, vm, 235; Migne, rI, 99. 60 Palmer and More, p. 179. 61 Ibid., p. 170.

A fiery chariot for aerial transportation is as old as the prophet Elisha and the impious Phaeton; but belongs first to a sorcerer in the person of Simon. 3 Treatise of the Soul, A-N L, IIn, 234. 64 To the similarities between the Faustbooks and the Homilies may be added the follow- ing parallel. The Historie states: "It is manifest that many vertuous parents have wicked children as Cayn, Ruben," etc. (Palmer and More, p. 135). The Volksbuch has "Es folget dameben auch offt dass fromme Elter gottlose vngerahtene Kinder haben, wie am Cain" etc. (ed. cit., p. 11). Cf. Homilies, xix, Ch. Ix: "Peter said ... We see many men who are good the fathers of wicked children . . For instance, the first man who was created pro- duced the unrighteous Cain" (A-N L, viII, 333; Patrol. Gr., II, 430). 102</page><page sequence="22">Beatrice Daw Brown of letters and a wide philosophical interest. Of Faustus, the Historie records that "none for his time were able to argue with him in Divinity" and "he was passing wise and excellent perfect in the Holy Scriptures."65 Simon's acquaintance with the Old Testament, and his apt use of Scriptural passages in argument, are amply demonstrated in the course of his discussions with Peter. Quotation would be tedious, but the con- clusion of one series of disputes may be cited: "In like manner Simon, by taking many passages from the Scriptures, seemed to show that God is subject to every infirmity."66 Again Faustus, like Simon, is given to argument, and is especially interested in questions of the origin of evil and the source of power of demons.67 Finally, both are consciously and explicitly seekers after truth. It will be recalled that Faustus in his first demand upon Mephistopheles stipulated that "in all Faustus his de- maunds or Interrogations the spirit should tell him nothing but that which is true."68 Simon more than once insists likewise upon truth as the goal of inquiry, but nowhere more strikingly than in the following speech addressed to Peter: Do not imagine that you will frighten me into not investigating the truth of your examples. For I am so eager for the truth that for its sake I will not shrink from undergoing danger.69 From the early records, then, we may reconstruct the figure of a magician-philosopher whose career coincides with what may be called the ground-plan of the Faustbook. Into this plan was fitted the closely associated theme of the blood compact from the legend of Theophilus, and upon its base was erected an elaborate superstructure of invention employing a variety of source materials-accounts of aerial travel, con- juring feats, horseplay, and philosophical discussion. But this pile of invention, although overlaying the original design with new details, does not conceal or markedly distort that design-the career of a magi- cian-scholar who by the aid of demons performs wvonders before the Em- peror and at Rome, summons phantoms of the ancient dead, travels through the heavens in a fiery car, discusses demonology and cosmogony, sleeps with Helen of Troy, and is finally punished by violent death for his com- 66 Ch. i; Palmer and More, p. 136.

This legendary figure is at once serious philosopher, powerful magician, and, by common repute, cheap sensational juggler of lustful habit of life. The Faust narrative could hardly have been compiled independently of this closely similar legend of Simon Magus. Much, of course, remains to be done in investigating the relationship between the Faust legend in its earlier stage and the tradition of Simon Magus which was current in the Middle Ages. I have here been content to bring forward items of major importance which establish the use of the legend of Simon by the compiler of the Faust-story-a conclusion which carries with it the corollary, that an intelligent person, familiar with some of these materials of the Simon legend, would be reminded of them when reading the Historie, or would turn to them. This, as I hope to show, represents the situation of Christopher Marlowe at the thresh- hold of his dramatization of the legend of Faustus. II. Marlowe's Dr. Faustus and Simon Magus 1. Availability of the literary treatments of Simon Magus for Marlowe.- Before proceeding to consider Marlowe's familiarity with the literature of the Simon Magus legend, one should note that the more important documents were available for him. For the Acts of Peter, the question hardly arises. The Life of Peter based upon it, which includes the material dealing with the competition in miracles at Nero's court and the destruction of Simon, constitutes an item in the Legenda Aurea. This collection was Englished and printed by Caxton, and Caxton's "Golden Legend" had wide circulation.70 The Clementine treatises were less generally known and so far as we know were not translated into English until many years later; but the Latin of these treatises (as, indeed, of the Acts of Peter) was not beyond a scholar of Marlowe's attainments. Of the two Clementines, only the Recognitions needs to be considered at this point, as the striking similarities with Marlowe's play which it offers are not shared by the Homilies. The latter, as was indicated earlier in this paper, is to be regarded as underlying the Continental prose version of the legend; it supplies the important clues of the name of Faustus as the double of Simon, and of Helena as his paramour (as over against the names Faustinianus and Luna in the Recognitions), and shows other similarities with the Faustbook which are not shared by the Recognitions. It is the Recognitions only which was apparently familiar to Marlowe, and the Recognitions was in free circulation. Editions are recorded in 1526, 1536, 1563, 1570, etc.71 70 For evidence, cf. Dr. E. C. Richardson, Proceedings of the American Soc. of Ch. Hist., I, 235-248. 71 Cf. Palmer and More, p. 11. 104</page><page sequence="24">Beatrice Daw Brown Further, although we need not assume that Marlowe's acquaintance with the Recognitions dates from his Cambridge period, the work may be said to lie within a field of reading natural to a divinity student. At the same time, it offered much more congenial reading than the average run of theological treatises. For, although nominally a work of pious edifica- tion, the Recognitions, as has been said, offers a highly different type of emphasis to the unorthodox reader. The record of the disputes of Simon with Peter reflects, on Simon's side, the action of a vigorous skeptical mind upon Church doctrine; a daring exploration of questions which an orthodox believer would think it blasphemous even to raise. Marlowe is, of course, generally credited with a freely ranging habit of thought in the field of theological speculation; and the mental appetite of a member of the Atheists' Club72 would naturally desire what sustenance was avail- able from the printed word. But heretical or even unorthodox documents were presumably not easy to come by and certainly not safe to own; the danger attendant upon the possession of such matter is demonstrated by Kyd's attempt to father upon Marlowe the fragmentary tract of Aryan heresy which had brought him into trouble.73 The Recognitions, however, exhibits a series of forcible rationalistic arguments which was not under the ban of the Church, inasmuch as Simon is always repre- sented as completely discredited by the replies of Peter. But the con- frontation which it offers of a self-assured dogmatism with an audacious and virile skepticism would unquestionably have appealed to Marlowe, as would, presumably, the piquancy of the situation of a book circulating freely as Christian propaganda which yet made available such quantities of heretical dynamite. The Recognitions includes, moreover, a considerable section devoted to a subject in which we know Marlowe to have had special interest- the nature of demons, the ways in which they secure power over men and ways in which they may be made to serve men; the cosmogony and mythology of the ancients; free-will and fatalism etc. This material is of too general a nature to come into consideration as a direct influence, but it provides an element in addition to the controversial interest which would have made the work congenial to Marlowe, in spite of its heavy bulk of uninspired homily. The fact that the Acts of Peter and the Recognitions were accessible for Marlowe and congenial to his mental temper does not, however, in itself establish his familiarity with these documents. 72 For discussion of the activities and reputation of the group, in which Raleigh, Mar- lowe, and Harriot were leading figures, see especially F. S. Boas, Marlowe and his Circle (1929) and M. C. Bradbrook, The School of Night (Camb. Univ. Press, 1936). 73 Cf. Boas, Marlowe and his Circle, pp. 69-70. 105</page><page sequence="25">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus 2. Dr. Faustus and the Acts of Peter.-Let us, then, briefly compare relevant portions of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus and the Acts of Peter, bearing in mind that the latter was available in Caxton's translation of the Legenda Aurea, that for the passages cited the English Historie affords no suggestion, or only a highly remote and distorted one; and, finally, that the group of incidents referred to in the Acts of Peter constitute almost the entire narrative, so far as it concerns Simon Magus, that is preserved in that account. It will be recalled that in Act iv, Sc. iii (I use the divisions in Professor Boas' edition, which is based on the 1616 quarto) Faustus permits himself to be beheaded by Benvolio in order to enjoy the amazement of the latter and his friends when he rises up uninjured. Similarly, Simon submits to a simulated beheading, in order that he may impress an audience (in this case Nero and his court) with his power of self-resur- rection.74 There is of course a large literature of trick beheadings, from St. Denys to the Green Knight; but the present comparison is restricted to professional conjurers who arrange for their own beheading at an imperial court. Again, in the same Act Faustus threatens to call forth a kennel of devil-hounds against Benvolio (iv, ii B.99-101): Dr. F. I'll raise a kennel of hounds, shall hunt him so As all his footmanship shall scarce prevail To keep his carcase from their bloody fangs. Benv. Hold, holdl he'll raise up a kennel of devils. This attack is envisaged as taking place "before this royal Emperor." In the Acts of Peter, Simon likewise summons demon-dogs to devour his enemy, and this incident also takes place before the Emperor. Then Simon having indignation, cried aloud: I command that dogs come and devour him. And suddenly there appeared great dogs and made an assault against Peter. ... Then said Peter to Nero: Lo... where he promised angels to come against me he brought dogs, thereby he showeth that he hath none angels but dogs.76 Marlowe's lines are doubtless impelled by his allusion to the Acteon myth,76 a few lines earlier; but the two cited passages are linked not only 74 Palmer and More, p. 37 (Caxton's Golden Legend). The means by which the feigned beheading is carried out in the Acts of Peter differs from that in the play; Simon deceives onlookers into thinking a severed ram's head is his own-a supernatural device recalling that by which Iphigenia is delivered, in one version of the legend, from the headsman's axe. The only instance of trick beheading in the Historie-that involving four jugglers and a water-lily-is obviously remote in suggestion. 75 Palmer and More, p. 38. 76 This myth is recalled also by a passage in the Historie: "this ceasing came a kennell of hounds, and they chased a great Hart in the hall, and there the Hart was slaine" 106</page><page sequence="26">Beatrice Daw Brown by the setting and the fact that the dogs are called out by the conjurer against his adversary, but by the implication that the dogs are diabolic agents. One or two parallels of detail may be noted. In both pieces, mention is made of the magician's destruction of his books. Simon casts his into the sea;77 Faustus cries (v. ii. 194) "I'll burn my books." Again, in both there is epigrammatic reference to the contrasting elements of man and devil in the magician. Faustus is thus addressed by the anonymous "old man" who urges him to repentance (v. i. 41-42): Though thou hast now offended like a man, Do not persever in it like a devil. Of Simon, Peter said, "[There] are in this magician two substances, that is of man and of the devil."78 The most significant correspondences, however, between the two pieces appear in connection with the repeated allusions, in Marlowe's play, to the fate of Faustus under the metaphor of a frustrated attempt at flight. The familiar lines in the Prologue come at once to mind: His waxen wings did mount above his reach, And, melting, heavens conspired his overthrow. Commentators usually dismiss these lines with the obvious remark that they refer to the fall of Icarus. But, while the classical story contributes the figurative waxen wings, it lacks any notion of divine conspiracy to bring about the hero's fall. The quoted lines, together with others in the play, look rather toward the Icarus-like fate of Simon Magus as described in the Acts of Peter. Simon boasted that he would fly to heaven from a lofty tower, which Nero caused to be erected for the purpose. At the appointed time he began his flight, supported by his demons; but when Peter adjured them in the name of Christ, their power failed, and Simon was dashed to pieces on the ground.79 To the figure of flight and fall, offered by the story of Simon's fatal attempt, Marlowe returns several times in alluding to the tragic end of Faustus. The note is sounded at the close of the play as at the beginning. In prophesying the (Palmer and More, p. 143). Although this passage supplies a "kennell of hounds," these are not used against a personal enemy. 77 Palmer and More, p. 36. 78 Ibid., pp. 37-38. 79 Ibid., p. 40.-The incident here related of Simon has, in fact, historic connection with the Icarus tradition. It is thought to have been suggested by the story (recorded by Suetonius and others) of an accident which happened in the Circus under Nero to a slave who had been required to enact the part of Icarus; cf. Renan, Antichrist, translated by Joseph Henry Allen (Boston, 1897), p. 60. 107</page><page sequence="27">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus hero's end, the Bad Angel suggests an ignominious physical fall (v. ii. 135-136): And so I leave thee, Faustus, till anon; Then wilt thou tumble in confusion. Again, we may look at verses 160-167 of the second scene of the last act: You stars that reign'd at my nativity, Whose influence hath allotted death and hell, Now draw up Faustus, like a foggy mist, Into the entrails of yon lab'ring cloud. These lines, whether read in the confused order in which they stand in the original text or as rearranged by Tucker Brooke,80 present the image of the conjurer drawn physically upward. And finally, the whole drama of Simon's broken flight is compressed into the moment when Faustus, tortured by the urge of hope against the consciousness of faith belied, utters the cry: O, I'll leap up to my God!-Who pulls me down? For the suddenly interjected concept of Faust "leaping up" to God, and feeling himself "pulled down" by adverse force personified, there is of course no suggestion in the Historie or elsewhere in the Faust tradition. The suggested situation is, however, precisely that presented by the fall of Simon Magus, -the conjurer, preparing to ascend to heaven, pulled down by the prayer of Peter. It would appear, then, that the Acts of Peter in some version, very probably in Caxton's Golden Legend, provided Marlowe with certain picturesque incidents connected with Simon Magus which he transferred to his hero, and with the dominant metaphor of the play, the frustrated flight which symbolizes Faustus' fall from superhuman heights. In no other narrative than the Acts of Peter are all these correspondences found in combination, and derivative versions such as those in metrical Saints' Lives are on various grounds unlikely source material. With respect solely to the fall of the magician, an auxiliary influence may possibly be assumed from the field of pictorial art. The fall of Simon Magus was a favorite subject with the painters of the Italian Renaissance;81 one of the 80 "Notes on Marlowe's Dr. Faustus," P. Q., xII, 22-23. 81 The following examples are noted by Mrs. Jameson, Sacred and Legendary Art (Boston and New York, 1895), I, 210: 1. Giunta Pisano (?), Cathedral, Assisi (1232). 2.

Caracci at Naples. 108</page><page sequence="28">Beatrice Daw Brown most interesting treatments is shown in the accompanying photograph. The original, which represents one panel of a four-paneled retable now in the possession of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City, was formerly in the San Marco chapel in Florence. It is believed to be the work of Benozzo Gozzoli and to have been painted about 1463.82 English art, however, affords no examples of pictorial representations of this subject prior to the seventeenth century; and though it is not impossible that such were known to Marlowe, they could hardly have done more than heighten the visual impression of the catastrophe. Whatever al- lowance be made for possible contributory influences, it appears virtually certain that Marlowe made direct use of the Acts of Peter. Indeed, the account of Simon in the Acts of Peter seems to have remained in Mar- lowe's memory almost en bloc, inasmuch as virtually all of its major situations83 are reflected in modified form in Dr. Faustus. 4. Dr. Faustus and the Recognitions.-The Recognitions presents a very different type of source material and hence a different type of in- fluence upon the processes of imagination and memory. Incidents in- volving Simon and allusions to him are not assembled into a running narrative account, but are interwoven with considerable portions of expository matter. Some of this is of the nature of homiletic abstraction, not likely to be retained in memory unless by a professional homilist. Other portions, dealing with mythology and natural science, have some 5.

Howe in the Burlington Magazine, vII, 377. I take this opportunity of expressing to the authorities of the Metropolitan Museum appreciation of their kind permission to reproduce this photograph. 83 An exception is the incident of Simon's unsuccessful attempt to resuscitate a dead body (cf. Palmer and More, pp. 38-39). Possibly there is a reminiscence of this situation in the lines spoken by Faustus in the Prologue: Couldst thou make men to live eternally, Or, being dead, bring them to life again, Then this profession were to be esteem'd. This incident also was treated in art; cf. Mrs. Jameson, op. cit., p. 204. 109</page><page sequence="29">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus little inherent interest for the secular reader. Against this expository background the narrative passages dealing with Simon-his disputes with Peter, the reports of his conjuring activities, and the final situation involving the family of Clement-stand out with a liveliness and graphic quality almost amounting to realism. Hence the appeal of the work to a memory keyed to dramatic receptivity would be highly uneven. Striking passages we should expect to reappear in an imaginative product as sporadic reminiscence, and this, up to a point, describes the reflection in Dr. Faustus of material from the Recognitions. Passages of the more lively type of exposition have supplied topics for a scene of dialogue, and several incidents and attributes attaching to the earlier magician are drawn by natural association into the picture of the later one. Although Marlowe's hero inherited from his prototype in the prose Historie a strong interest in argument, and particularly in discussions of the demon-world and the structure of the physical universe, Marlowe does not seem to have used the actual substance of conversations in the Historie. There is, then, special interest in the fact that the dialogue between Dr. Faustus and Mephistopheles, in Act II, Sc. ii, repeats in its topical structure a group of items which were among the topics of dis- cussion in the Recognitions. The resemblance does not extend to points of detail, but five of the six topics concerning which Dr. Faustus ques- tions Mephistopheles are discussed, in Bk. vIII of the Recognitions, within the space of a few pages. These topics, as will be recalled, are as follows: the notion of a single enfolding sphere; the motions of the planets; the dominion or "intelligentia" of each star; the ccelum igneum; and the notion that the Creator of the world is not to be named. It will be seen from the following quotations that the series of topics presented by Faustus to Mephistopheles for elucidation appear also in fairly close formation in Peter's exposition of natural science. 1. The enfolding sphere. Meph. As are the elements, such are "But if you would rather have the the heavens, opinions of others of the Greek philoso- Even from the moon unto the im- phers ... you are of course familiar perialorb, with their deliverance concerning the Mutually folded in each others' heavens.

A-N L, vIII, 189.86 "Also, they assert that the heaven as the higher structure, is composed of fiery atoms, which are lighter, and al- ways fly upward."

A-N L, vmII, 169.88 We should not expect a dramatist to quote expository matter with verbal exactness, yet these passages, which represent a group of peaks of memory in a plateau of vaguely recollected reading of a dialogue con- cerning cosmogony, do offer certain striking correspondences of phrase with the dialogue in Sc. ii. An earlier passage in the same scene presents an even closer parallel. Mephistopheles, answering an inquiry by Faust in regard to heaven, says, "'Twas made for man." Similarly, in answer to a question from Simon as to why heaven was made, Peter replies. "It was made for the sake of this present life of men."89 Closer and more specific similarities appear in the treatment of the central figure. The versatility of Dr. Faustus, who credits himself with expertness in many fields, is no new thing; the Faustus of the Historie at the outset "named himself an Astrologian, and a Mathematician; and for a shadow sometimes a Phisitian."90 But the hero of Marlowe's drama asserts himself to be, in addition to these, adept as a logician (I. i. 7-10): Bene disserere est finis logices. Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end? Affords this art no greater miracle? Then read no more: thou hast attain'd that end. Simon Magus also had a reputation in the field of syllogistic logic. It 88 Plato ignem, aquam, aerem, terram; Aristoteles etiam quintum introducit elementum, quod &amp;KaTov6raaTov, id est incompellabile nominavit, sine dubio illum indicans, qui in unum quatuor elementa conjungens mundum fecerit (Migne, i, 1378). There is an allusion in the Historie (ch. 18; Palmer and More, p. 160) to the "fifth essence" apparently in the sense of a divine element, but without any intimation that its name should not be named: " ... the elements, fire, ayre, water and earth, and all that is contained in them, yea herein there is nothing hidden from me but onely the fift essence, which once thou hadst Faustus at liberty but now Faustus thou hast lost it past recouery." The Volksbuch speaks plainly of God who created the elements, making no mention of a "fifth essence": "Der Gott der dich erschaffen hat, hat auch die Welt und alle Elementa vnter dem Himmel erschaffen" (ed. cit., p. 44). 89 A-N L, vIII, 121; cf. Migne, Patrol. Gr., i, 1295: Respondens ait: Ad ea quae volo responde mihi et dic, si visibile istud, ut ais, coelum resolvetur, cur ex initio factum est? Respondit Petrus: Propter hominum praesentem hanc factum est vitam. 90 Ch. 1; Palmer and More, p. 136. 112</page><page sequence="32">Beatrice Daw Brown was reported by Niceta, a former follower converted by Peter, that "Simon himself is a most vehement orator, trained in the dialectic art, and in the meshes of syllogisms."91 Again, both magicians go through the motions of a transient repentance, which is immediately followed by apostasy. Faustus will, in a moment of wavering, "turn to God again," but is resolved in the next instant to build an altar to Beelzebub.92 This volte-face does not occur in the Historie; the earlier Faustus, although at one point bewailing his sin with expressions of remorse, is described as "neuer falling to repentance truly."93 But Simon Magus allegedly went through a similarly brief and specious repentance, followed by a prompt return to his original error. Peter, commenting on this performance, says: "You see, brethren, Simon seeking repentance; in a little while you shall see him returning again to his infidelity."94 Finally, there is a striking similarity between the speeches in which the respective magicians express their intentions as to the use of their magical powers. In the course of the first act of Dr. Faustus, the hero utters two soliloquies, each consisting of a linked series of parallel sentences, built upon the construction "I'll." The first follows upon the adjuration of the Evil Angel that he "go forward-in that famous art." Faustus, delirious with the sense of power, devises fantastic tasks to lay upon the spirits which are to be subject to him (I. i. 83-91): I'll have them fly to India for gold, I'll have them read me strange philosophy, I'll have them wall all Germany with brass I'll have them fill the public schools with silk, etc. In the second soliloquy, Faustus, using the same future-tense formula, declares the amazing uses to which he himself will put his magical resources (I. iii. 106, 112): -'I'll be great Emperor of the world. The Emperor shall not live but by my leave. Structurally, these soliloquies repeat the formula of a speech in which Simon declares the miracles which he proposes to perform. The list in his case shows a mixture of the trivial and the magnificent, including some of the foolish tricks with which he was credited by ecclesiastical writers and by means of which his reputation became debased. I shall change myself into a sheep or a goat; I shall make a beard to grow upon little boys; I shall ascend by flight into the air; I shall exhibit abundance of 91 A-N L, viii, 98; Migne, I, 1250: "Simon vehementissimus est orator, in arte dialectica et syllogismorum tendiculis enutritus." 92 Act II, Sc. 1. 93 Palmer and More, p. 151. 4 A-N L, viii, 126; Migne, I, 1302. 113</page><page sequence="33">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus gold, and shall make and unmake kings. I shall be worshipped as God; I shall have divine honours publicly assigned to me so that an image of me shall be set up, and I shall be worshipped and adored as God.96 Not only the formula, but certain of the wonders prophesied by Simon are taken over into Faustus' speech. Simon's vaunt "I shall exhibit abun- dance of gold, and shall make and unmake kings" is translated by Mar- lowe in vivid particulars: I'll have them fly to India for gold. I'll chase the King of Parma from the land And reign sole king of all the provinces. The Emperor shall not live but by my leave. The theme of Faustus' impassioned outburst is expressed with bald simplicity in the final phrase of Simon: "Whatever I wish, I shall be able to do." And the early magician's boast that he will be worshipped as God, strikes the note sounded in the Evil Angel's counsel to Faustus (I, i. 77): "Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky." Certain details in relation to Simon, have, then, been carried over from the Recognitions into Dr. Faustus on a natural current of association. But this same current could hardly have failed to convey also the general impression made on the mind of the poet by the character of the early magician. Can we infer, with any certainty, what this impression would have been? Dogmatic statement is assuredly not in place in such a mat- ter. But, since the characteristic qualities of Marlowe's mind and temperament are well defined and well known, we can with some show of reason infer his reaction to the character of the magician which can be reconstructed from the text. For this reconstruction we may limit our- selves to the material in Book II, which covers the first series of debates. Nothing in this book is controverted by material in later books. The account of Simon given early in Book II (Chs.v-xIx)96by his former followers, Niceta and Aquila, clearly illustrates the double sug- gestion borne by characteristic descriptions of the magician-an affirma- tion of wickedness, an implication of power. Niceta fears that Peter "may seem to be overmatched" by Simon, who is skilled not only in oratory but in magic arts. "And therefore I fear," he continues, "lest haply, being so strongly fortified on every side, he shall be thought to be de- fending the truth, whilst he is alleging falsehoods in the presence of those who do not know him. For neither should we ourselves have been able to escape from him and to be converted to the Lord had it not been that while we were his assistants and the sharers of his errors, we had ascertained that he was a deceiver and a magician." 96 A-N L, vIII, 99; Migne, I, 1252-55. 96 Ibid., 1250-58. 114</page><page sequence="34">Beatrice Daw Brown Aquila continues the warning to Peter, emphasizing the power and magnetism of Simon. I call God to witness that I feel for thee, not as knowing thee to be weaker in debate,-for indeed I was never present at any dispute in which thou wert engaged,-but because I well know the impieties of this man, I think of thy reputation, and at the same time the souls of the hearers, and above all, the interest of the truth itself. For this magician is vehement toward all things that he wishes, and wicked above measure. For in all things we know him well, since from boyhood we have been assistants and ministers of his wickedness; and had not the love of God rescued us from him, we should even now be engaged in the same evil deeds with him. But a certain inborn love towards God rendered his wickedness hateful to us, and the worship of God attractive to us. Whence I think also that it was the work of Divine Providence, that we, being first made his associates, should take knowledge in what manner or by what art he effects the prodigies which he seems to work. For who is there that would not be as- tonished at the wonderful things which he does? Who would not think that he was a god come down from heaven for the salvation of men? For myself, I con- fess, if I had not known him intimately, and had taken part in his doings, I would easily have been carried away with him. He reports Simon's pretensions to Godhead. By nation he is a Samaritan, from a village of the Gettones; by profession a magician, yet exceedingly well trained in the Greek literature; desirous of glory, and boasting above all the human race, so that he wishes himself to be believed to be an exalted power, which is above God the Creator, and to be thought to be the Christ, and to be called the Standing One. There follows an account of the connection of Simon with the sect of Dositheus, among whom he claimed chief place. A boastful speech of Simon is quoted. . . .me, Simon, who by magic art am able to show many signs and prodigies, by means of which either my glory or our sect may be established. For I am able to render myself invisible to those who wish to lay hold of me, and again to be visible when I am willing to be seen. If I wish to flee, I can dig through the mountains, and pass through rocks as if they were clay. If I should throw my- self headlong from a lofty mountain, I should be borne unhurt to the earth, as if I were held up; when bound, I can loose myself, and bind those who had bound me; being shut up in prison I can make the barriers open of their own accord; I can render statues animated, so that those who see suppose that they are men. I can make new trees suddenly spring up, and produce sprouts at once. I can throw myself into the fire, and not be burnt; I can change my countenance so that I cannot be recognized; but I can show people that I have two faces. The speech concludes with the series of statements of future intention, "I shall change myself into a sheep," etc., quoted above (pp. 113-114). He is reputed to be God. 115</page><page sequence="35">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus Many other wonderful things he did and does, so that men, being astonished at them, think that he himself is the great God. He concludes his account with the report that Simon made a boy out of air-or, as it was rumored, from the soul of a slain child-97and Peter denounces the impious wizard in unmeasured terms. The three proceed to the house of Zacchaeus, where in the courtyard "a great multitude of people were assembled . . . and Simon the magician stand- ing in the midst of them like a standard-bearer." The devout believer, reading with passive mind, would find the above account presenting the offensive figure of a charlatan and blasphemer. Suppose the reader to be not only a free-thinker, but one whose imagina- tion tended always to stretch out to embrace the infinite, capable of evolving a Tamburlaine, of measureless ambition for power; a Barabbas, of measureless villainy. Such a reader could hardly fail to see a figure whose alleged "wickedness" is "above measure," but whose wickedness appears actually to consist in a superb self-confidence, a dilated sense of personal power, which makes him believe himself to be a God, and inspires the same belief in his followers, among whom he stands "like a standard-bearer." The account of the debates between Peter and Simon (Chs. xx-LXI) is further revealing not only as to the rationalistic nature of Gnostic criticism, but as the mental and personal quality of its interpreter. Peter opens the dispute with a pious salutation, "Peace be to all of you who are prepared to give your right hands to truth." and proceeds to expound in a tone of devout faith, the complete righteousness of God, and con- cludes with a request for "patience and quietness" on the part of the hearers, "for in order to this at the first, by way of salutation I prayed for peace to you all." Simon takes issue with Peter's notion of the value of peace: We have no need of your peace; for if there be peace and concord, we shall not be able to make any advance toward the discovery of truth. For robbers and debauchees have peace among themselves, and every wickedness agrees with itself; and if we have met with this view, that for the sake of peace we should give assent to all that is said, we shall confer no benefit upon the hearers, but on the contrary, we shall impose upon them, and depart friends. Wherefore, do not invoke peace, but rather battle, which is the mother of peace; and if you can, exterminate errors. Peter corrects Simon's perversion of his request for peace: And I do not now wish, as Simon says that I do, that assent should be given for 97 Ibid., p. 126; Migne, I, 1302.-This passage, doubtless the basis of the "homunculus" tradition, has no bearing on the Marlowe problem. 116</page><page sequence="36">Beatrice Daw Brown the sake of peace to those things that are spoken amiss; but that truth should be sought for with quietness and order. He invites trouble, however, by going on to say that "the way of God is the way of peace." Simon quotes the saying of Jesus, "I came not to bring peace, but a sword," affirming that Peter's desire for peace among the listeners is inconsistent with his Master's teachings. Peter counters with "Blessed are the peacemakers," the teaching of Jesus which he is seeking to carry out. The inconsistency is immediately seized upon by Simon: In your desire to answer for your Master, O Peter, you have brought a much more serious charge against him, if he himself came not to make peace, yet enjoined upon others to keep it. Peter attempts to reconcile the two sayings in a long circumlocutory speech, which leads to minor dispute over the text "Every kingdom divided against itself shall not stand"; and concludes: I desire that what is salutary and profitable be brought to the knowledge of all; and therefore I shall not delay to state it as briefly as possible. There is one God, and he is the Creator of the world, a righteous judge, rendering to every one at some time or other according to his deeds. This statement of the orthodox creed gives Simon an opening for presenting the central philosophy of Gnostic faith, the unknowable God: I say that there are many gods, but that there is one incomprehensible and un- known to all, and that He is the God of all these Gods. Challenged by Peter to support these assertions from the Scriptures or other prophetic books, Simon-anticipating the higher criticism of a later day-cites freely from Genesis passages illustrating the polytheism of the early Hebrews. Peter's reply is to the effect that the so-called gods are gods in name only; and that the God of the Old Testament, the Creator, is the one true God, whom Jesus preached and who is known to all true believers. After some further argument as to the unknown God, Peter reasserts the Christian position: "But the Son reveals the Father to those who honour the Son as they honour the Father." Simon's reply challenges the anthropomorphism of the Christian conception of Deity, confronting it with the assertion of the mystery at the core of Gnostic philosophy; and his sense of this mystery is expressed in poetic superlative (Ch. XLIx): Remember that you said that God has a son, which is doing him wrong; for how can he have a son, unless he is subject to passions, like men or animals? But on these points there is not time now to show your profound folly, for I hasten to make a statement concerning the immensity of the supreme light; and so now 117</page><page sequence="37">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus listen. My opinion is, that there is a certain power of immense and ineffable light, whose greatness may be held to be incomprehensible. In the course of the remaining argument, Simon clarifies further the distinction between the Gnostic concept of "one God, who is better than all, from whom all that is took its beginning," and the God of the Old Testament, who is "in many respects weak, whereas weakness is utterly incompatible with a perfect God." He illustrates his argument with an analysis of the Garden of Eden story (Ch. LIII): For this God, as I have said, according to what the writing of the law teaches, is shown to be weak in many things. In the first place, because the man whom he formed was not able to remain such as he had intended him to be; and because he cannot be good who gave a law to the first man, that he should eat of all the trees of paradise, but that he should not touch the tree of knowledge; and if he should eat of it, he should die. For why should he forbid him to eat and to know what is good and what evil, that, knowing, he might shun the evil and choose the good? But this he did not permit; and because he did eat in violation of the commandment, and discovered what is good, and learned for the sake of honour to cover his nakedness... he condemns to death him who had learned to do honour to God and curses the serpent who had shown him these things. But truly, if man was to be injured by this means, why did he place the cause of in- jury in paradise at all? But if that which he placed in paradise was good, it is not the part of one that is good to restrain another from good. Peter, after further devout defense of the Creator revealed in the Scriptures, demands of Simon a means of apprehending the unknown God. Simon's reply must be quoted in full (Ch. LXI): Listen now, therefore. Did you never in thought reach forth your mind into regions or islands situated far away, and remain so fixed in them that you could not even see the people that were before you, or know where yourself were sitting, by reason of the delightfulness of those things on which you were gazing? And Peter said: It is true, Simon, this has often occurred to me. Then Simon said: In this way now reach forth your sense into heaven,98 yea above the heaven, and behold that there must be some place beyond the world, or outside the world, in which there is neither heaven nor earth, and where no shadow of these things produces darkness; and consequently, since there are neither bodies in it, nor darkness occasioned by bodies, there must of necessity be immense light; and consider of what sort that light must be, that is never succeeded by darkness. For if the light of this sun fills this whole world, how great do you suppose that bodiless and infinite light to be? So great, doubtless, that this light of the sun would seem to be darkness and not light, in comparison. This report of the disputes between Peter and Simon, like Niceta's 98 The phrase suggests the lines spoken by Faustus (I, i, 61-62): But his dominion that exceeds in this / Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man. 118</page><page sequence="38">Beatrice Daw Brown account of the latter's reputation, would undoubtedly present a monster of heresy and blasphemy to the view of the pious believer. But certainly it is not as a pious believer that Marlowe would have read it. And if it is read in the spirit of the humanist and intellectual free lance, with what attributes does it clothe the protagonist of Gnostic heresy? First, a mili- tant restlessness of spirit which rejects ideals of peace and order. Again, an incisive realistic logic which seizes upon inconsistencies in the text of the Scriptures and in orthodox dogma. Finally, a dominant power of imagination, urgent to break down the barriers of the known and reach out into the infinite, and expressing itself in poetic superlatives. In brief, for the reader of antinomian temper, Simon emerges as a splendid rebel, and this is surely as Marlowe would have seen him.99 The above group of attributes virtually constitutes, indeed, the tradi- tional characterization of Marlowe himself, as it has been derived from his life records and his own dramatic expression. We recall Kyd's ar- raignment of Marlowe as one who "hath quoted a number of con- trarieties out of Scripture, and (he) did strive in argument to frustrate and confute what hath been spoke and writt by prophets and such holie men."'00 Again, we may cite a phrase applied to Marlowe's mental temper by one of his modern interpreters, Professor Boas: "A rationalist intelligence blasting its destructive way through all that was held in reverential awe by his contemporaries."'10 This describes with singular aptness the driving force of Simon's logic against Peter's devout accept- ance of dogma. And as the impatient rationalism of Marlowe repeats that of the early thinker, so also does his characteristic "passion pour l'infini" recall the imagination of Simon which would reach forth "into heaven, yea above the heaven," into a region of measureless and infinite light. The affinity between the two temperaments need not be labored. The nature of Simon is obviously one to which Marlowe's is attuned. And beyond this, Simon is a personality with an exalted sense of his own being, believing himself to participate in Godhead. In the light of Mar- lowe's acquaintance with this superhuman figure, how are we to read Dr. Faustus? 99 It may be said, in support of this humanistic reading of the record, that to the secular vision of Renaissance Italy Simon appeared in no ignoble light. In none of the pictures that I have seen is he presented with grotesque or offensive accent. The picture attributed to Ludovico Caracci (1555-1619) shows him in his headlong fall as a man of splendid physique; the scene gives the suggestion of great power about to be destroyed. And the representation of Simon in a fresco in the Brancacci Chapel which is attributed to Filippino Lippi is described by Mrs. Jameson as "a magnificent figure, who might serve for a Prospero" (op. cit., p. 204). 100 Cf. Boas, Marlowe and his Circle, p. 75. 0lo Ibid., p. 77. 119</page><page sequence="39">Marlowe, Faustus, and Simon Magus It is commonly said of the hero of Marlowe's drama that in so far as he rises above the hero of the Faustbook he represents an infiltration of the poet's own personality. Something of truth there' undoubtedly is in this statement, inasmuch as Tamburlaine and Barabbas, as well as Dr. Faustus, embody the projection of a will-to-power which must hence be regarded as dominant in Marlowe's psychology. But in the case of Dr. Faustus, the conventional criticism requires that we go much farther, regarding the projection of the poet's personality as completely filling the gap between the figure of legend and the tragic hero. In the absence of any available contributory source, we should be obliged to fall back on such a hypothesis, although it has its difficulties. The legendary hero, although he is in an extremely interesting situation, is himself of little inherent interest-certainly lacking in the magnetism necessary to at- tract an imaginative reader into a sense of identity. Marlowe would not have found in him an object for his characteristic interest in "human passion in dilation under stress of inordinate desires and extraordinary afflictions," and we are driven to assume that he clothed this inadequate model with an exaltation which he felt would have been his own in the given circumstances. That is not impossible; but a dramatic imagination is not usually forced to consume its own substance unless starved for available external food. Further, not even the most unquestioning ad- herent of the conventional view of Marlowe's self-projection would be willing to apply it literally and consistently, to the point of including Faustus' aspiration to Godhead (I. i. 63-64): A sound magician is a demi-god. Here, tire my brains to get a deity. But all these difficulties are resolved through Simon Magus, superhuman prototype of Faustus, linked externally with the hero of the Historie and representing, through basic affinity, Marlowe's own temperament. To assert, then, in the presence of an available contributory source, that Marlowe made up for the deficiencies of the hero of the Historie wholly by an objectified concept of himself is to dogmatize. That this source provides a hero similar in many aspects to the legendary Faust, associated with him in a long tradition but constructed on a far more heroic scale, cannot be dismissed as coincidence. Further, the employment of plural sources is in accord with Marlowe's habit as we know it from Tamburlaine. The variety of source-materials for the latter play assembled by Miss Ellis-Fermor creates an initial presumption as to Marlowe's source technique with which Professor Boas' assertion of a sole exclusive source for Dr. Faustus in the Faust- book is strikingly at variance. 120</page><page sequence="40">Beatrice Daw Brown Acceptance of the conclusions of this paper with regard to Marlowe's use of the Acts of Peter and the Recognitions carries implications beyond the extension of our knowledge of Marlowe's Belesenheit. Within limits, they have a bearing on the question of the date of composition of Dr. Faustus. The argument for an early date, 1588-89, is based by its pro- ponents largely on internal evidence, the academic quality of the play and the learned references, which seem to bring it near to Marlowe's Cambridge period. The reflection of further reading in ecclesiastical literature recorded in this paper might seem to favor this hypothesis. At the same time the maturity of thought in Dr. Faustus precludes the theory of an extremely early date. Marlowe's use of literary treatments of Simon Magus is, then, an aid to the interpretation of Dr. Faustus, in so far as we are thereby enabled to resolve the riddle of its inequality of scale on a rational basis. We need no longer have recourse, in order to explain the strange juxtaposing of exalted and base, spiritual and earthy, to the theory that Marlowe's imagination operated on a kind of alternating current, which now led him, in a mood of exaltation, to throw himself completely into the hero's situation, now relaxed to allow him to record impersonally the comic trivialities of the same hero. But in the light of an available con- tributory source for the hero, we can follow the undulations of the plane of the play as reactions to varying aspects of blended source material. Throughout the low comedy sequences, Dr. Faustus keeps more or less to the plane of the hero of the Historie-the jaunty wizard who is the direct descendant of a circus version of Simon Magus. But certain situations in the play are fraught with profound emotional suggestion. Such are, particularly, the opening scenes, where the hero glimpses the infinite possibilities of magical power; the intermediate scenes where he is torn by inner conflict; and the final scene of desperate hope and tragic defeat. These evoke the image of Faustus' prototype in its original heroic outline, the magician capable of such dazzling wonders that he was re- puted a demi-god, whose magnificent belief in himself led him to attempt flight into heaven. Artistic unity of impression such as surrounds the single-minded conqueror Tamburlaine is under such circumstances im- possible. But Marlowe has achieved a far more important thing in Dr. Faustus than external unity-he has recreated a superman. BEATRICE DAW BROWN Hunter College of the City of New York 121</page></plain_text>
