It was conceived in a spirit of cross- disciplinary exchange, a desirable virtue in our academic climate where these different ways of analysis are too often wrenched apart. The authors privileged different approaches, positions and perspectives. However, each paper seeks to build intellectual bridges to Seznec's contribution. The volume begins with an introductory part containing three papers. E. Sears delivers a sustained meditation on archival discoveries regarding the epistolary exchanges between Saxl and Seznec, which are fundamental for an understanding of the conception of Seznec's book. In the second essay, R. Duits points to the structure of the book and its transcendence in the research of the Warburg Institute. What is perhaps most distinctive about this first section is its propaedeutic approach, also reflected in F. Quiviger 's brief essay, which introduces us to the extraordinarily useful website of digitised sources. The second section deals with different topics related to the tradition of survival and is developed in seven essays under the title 'Traditions'. K. Lippincott explains the complex origin of Eridanus' iconography and its changing history through the Middle Ages and until the Renaissance. She successfully shows how Eridanus became a river-man in iconography during a dynamic age when those manuscripts were produced, keeping in mind the lack of access to the original Greek sources. She also challenges the point of view of Saxl and Seznec about the transmission of that iconography. The Pagan Sky is introduced by R. Duits, whose paper addresses how illus- trations of constellation cycles in manuscripts survived during the Middle Ages. He offers a useful survey of these images and their survival and sketches the historiographic background of this kind of research. He outlines Warburg's and Saxl's viewpoints, their influence on Seznec's book and how these authors, who are fundamental for the study of constellation cycles, should be reconsidered. Duits ends by discussing the astrological importance of the signs of the zodiac in some individual constellation cycles, and D. Blume returns to the nitty-gritty of the pagan sky, focussing on the planets. Michael Scot's book, Liber introductorius , was a propaedeutic one which was 'a remarkable synthesis of different and in part contradictory traditions' (p. 131). In his book the images were an essential part, to the extent that determined the astrological interpretation, as Blume states The Classical Review vol. 61 no. 2 © The Classical Association 201 1; all rights reserved</page><page sequence="2">602 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW of Cassiopea (p. 133). There is no interest in ancient myths or ancient attributes, and Scot virtually creates a new tradition for the depiction of planets which has nothing to do with the gods of Antiquity. Blume's paper differs from the classical interpretation of Saxl and Seznec: 'in the field of planetary astrology, there was in fact no survival of the pagan gods' (p. 136). This represents the start of a new figurative tradition sealed by Giotto in his frescoes in the Palazzo della Ragione (Padua). S. Vervacke's paper, 'Autour des "Dieux d'Albricus" et de leur Usage', deals with the sources and the textual roots of the De deorum imaginibus libellus. Her contribution is characteristically provocative, first because one of the issues it raises is the relationship with Pierre Bersuire's De formis figurisque deorum which would better explain some particularities of Albricus' text. Secondly, she introduces an interpretation of that manuscript's usage based on a very typical monastic practice: the meditation through images, ies portraits des dieux du libellus proposent une somme des res memorabiles ' (p. 170). G. Huber-Rebenich shows how the Expositio of Giovanni di Virgilio is the main source to explain the visual discrepancies in illustrations of Ovid's Metamorphoses until the sixteenth century. The transcendence of that lecture on the Metamorphoses of 1321 is blatant in much later works, especially in the Tuscan volgarizzatore Giovanni di Bonsignori but also in the illustrations made for Lodovico Dolce 's Transformationi from 1553 onwards. Huber-Rebenich not only exposes discrepan- cies between the Latin original and the Renaissance illustrations based on Giovanni di Virgilio 's version, but also provides a transcription of the whole Expositio , from which only some excerpts are available. The essence of ancient gods in Achille Bocchi and Pierino Valeriano is the topic of the papers by A. and S. Rolet. The former prefers to focus on one particular example: Hermes in his multiple guises in the Symbolicae Quaestiones of Achille Bocchi. Hermes as 'apostle of Nicodemism' is one of the many issues that she exposes in her analysis of this complex and personal view of the god. S. Rolet, on the other hand, deals with the conception of the Hieroglyphica as a 'miscellanea hapax', which was based on literary sources such as Horapollo and on classical art. That particularity determines the representation of pagan gods. The third part, 'Forms', includes five papers which discuss pagan gods in differ- ent moments of history. The first three essays are the only ones that focus on ancient art, the very matrix of the whole conception of survival. First, E. Pellizer treats the concept of anthropomorphism in ancient Greece which explains the foundation of Western Art Aesthetics. Secondly, J. Fabre-Serris turns to the analysis of the emblematic figure of Dionysus from the point of view of the literary resources at the end of the first century B.C. Finally, R. Webb addresses the presence of gods as characters on the Late Antique stage. As she states, Seznec 's book did not deal with this subject. The lack of sources on ancient pantomime conflicts directly with our natural reliance on textual and artistic sources. Webb suggests that this practice is at least as important as sculpture or painting representing gods (p. 301) because it works as a stimulus for the audience's visual imagination. The process is parallel to viewing and interpreting paintings and sculptures, since the beholder needs 'expertise in decoding of gesture' just as for visual art (p. 305). The last two papers in this section are devoted to Renaissance art. P. Morel's essay is on the iconography of Luca Signorelli's Pan Enthroned among Shepherds and Nymphs , suggesting an interpretation based on contemporary politics. S.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 603 Mamone explains the use of pagan gods in sixteenth-century mythological spec- tacles in terms that do not agree with the well-established continuity of classical models. 'The Science of Mythology', the fourth section, addresses the Cartari, Giraldi and Conti mythographical manuals. F. Graziani argues that these books can no longer be considered mere handbooks for artists or as a second-hand product of sixteenth-century authors. These books were meant to be a contemporary response to and interpretation of the classical heritage. The last paper, 'The Influence of Manuals' by E. McGrath, is a section on its own. Her contribution deals with the main topic of most of the studies on iconography, namely how artists used myths and which were their sources. She starts by pointing out how Seznec's biased point of view regarding mythographic handbooks determined his approach to artistic creation. However, she does not consider Seznec's interpretation in itself, but rather what he did not pursue, i.e. 'to look at mythography and the manuals from the perspective of painters themselves' (p. 391). In engaging with these broad themes, this volume has a complexity of its own: as should be clear to scholars familiar with Seznec's book, 'Traditions' and 'Forms' are sections that mirror Book 1 of Seznec's oeuvre devoted to 'Survival of Pagan Gods', while the last two sections are related to Book 2. The organisation of this conference privileged contributions that dealt with the cross-fertilisation of those different approaches: papers that put together variables of classical iconography, classical tradition and Seznec's contribution in innovative ways, or that explored how Seznec's book and Warburgian scholars themselves embodied and criticised cultural discourses. This extraordinary volume, like the congress from which it originates, is intended as an invitation to further reflection on these and other topics, and not as a fait accompli in a spirit of re-evaluation and exchange.
