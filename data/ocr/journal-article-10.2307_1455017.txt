<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXXII, Nos. 1-2 (July-October, 1991) 224-226 IDEL'S KABBALAH* Here is a book that has become a phenomenon, even a sensation. For over a decade Prof. Moshe Idel, of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has been pub- lishing elegant and superbly documented studies of the kabbalah in Hebrew journals. Beginning in 1988 a portion of Idel's work became available to English readers through the auspices of the SUNY Series in Judaica (The Mystical Experience in Abraham Abulafia [1988]; Studies in Ecstatic Kabbalah [1988]; and Language, Torah, and Hermeneutics in Abraham Abulafia [1989]). While these volumes are either monographs or collections of articles on a theme, Kabbalah: New Perspectives attempts to be a sustained grand vision-or better yet, a re-vision-of the state of Kabbalistic research and the phenomenology of Jewish mysticism. Because Kabbalah: New Perspectives includes a resolute attack on the work of the late Professor Gershom Scholem, the undisputed founder of the newly created field of history of Jewish mysticism, this volume has already become the focus of much popular attention and scholarly controversy, and will forever mark a watershed in the scholarship on Jewish mysticism. The volume is divided into ten chapters, and is somewhat disjointed in its presentation. Even within individual chapters, one often gets the feeling that a series of unconnected observations and explications are gathered together under chapter headings. The book reads as a series of monographs, only loosely con- nected, and in some chapters (notably chapter 6), there are abrupt and discon- tinuous stops and starts. The book itself is thankfully free of the stylistic and editorial inconsistencies which marred the SUNY volumes (I spotted only one misprint: p. 21: "such R. Shem Tov ibn Gaon" should read "such as R. Shem Tov ibn Gaon"). The first two chapters review and advance the state of modern research on Jewish mysticism. Early on Idel enunciates an extremely useful phenomenological distinction between two distinct types of Jewish mystical experience: (1) the theosophical/theurgical mysticism characterized by the better-known sefirotic kabbalah, best exemplified by the Sefer ha-Zohar; and (2) the ecstatic mysticism represented by the prophetic kabbalah of Abraham Abulafia and his disciples. These two phenomenologies serve as a skeletal framework for the rest of the book's discussion, and inform all subsequent chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 address the issue of devequt and unio mystica in each of the phenomenologies. It is Idel's contention, in opposition to Scholem, that unio * Moshe Idel. Kabbalah: New Perspectives.

Furthermore, Idel draws striking parallels between Abulafia's ecstatic mysticism and the much later mysticism of Hasidism, thereby resurrecting the importance of Hasidism for the study of Jewish mysticism. Scholem's subtly attenuated appreciation of Hasidism as a full-blown mystical system is thus repudiated by Idel (pp. 49-51). Chapter 5 addresses a topic mostly ignored by modern historians and theoreti- cians: namely, the existence of a set of specific mystical practices and techniques which catalyzed devequt-unio mystica experiences. With this work, we can now appreciate Jewish mysticism as having a set of performances and practices which induce a specific mystical experience, unlike, but structurally akin to, the tech- niques found in Sufi and Asian mysticism. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 deal with theosophy and theurgy, and highlight Idel's reconstructive methodology; this approach is essentially based upon an untested hypothetical reconstruction of the religious trends in rabbinic Judaism and a presumption that kabbalistic traditions concerning the antiquity of kabbalah contain a kernel of truth. In this regard, Idel draws from the spirit of Max Kadushin's description of the "normal mysticism" of the sages. It is Idel's conten- tion that a good deal of kabbalistic doctrine reflects already existing experiential orientations, theosophies, and techniques of antique Judaism, hints of which he finds scattered in ancient midrash, ancient gnostic texts under the supposed influence of Judaism, and later kabbalistic traditions. Using this reconstructive approach, Idel sharply rejects Scholem's contention that an external gnostic substrate informs Jewish mysticism. Idel recognizes a shared phenomenology between rabbinic Judaism and Gnosticism, but puts forward an opposing hy- pothesis for this commonality: the Gnostics drew from Judaism, and not the other way around (see p. 116, for example, on the anthropomorphic decad). The final two chapters are individual essays on kabbalistic hermeneutics and on the reverberations of kabbalah in Renaissance and modern thought. As the first major rethinking of kabbalah, there is much in this book that is worth commending: over and against the predominant philological-textological approach that characterized the bulk of Scholem's work, Idel self-consciously argues on behalf of an admittedly eclectic methodology which draws substantially from the works of phenomenologists. Whereas Scholem tended to focus on the topographical abstractions of kabbalah, Idel prefers to see Jewish mysticism as fundamentally an experiential lore. By shifting the focus of study away from the history of ideas to the realm of possible mystical experience, Idel opens the kabbalah to psychological, phenomenological, and comparative analyses in a way that Scholem's hermetic inquiry rarely permitted. One of the most tantalizing openings that Idel argues is the need for researchers to enter into dialogue with the actual practitioners of kabbalah: "contact with kabbalists who both study and conduct their lives in accordance with the requirements of the kabbalah can enrich the academic vision of what kabbalah is" (p. 25).</page><page sequence="3">226 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW There is a critical portrayal of Scholem's work which pervades the book; while Idel lauds Scholem's pioneering efforts, he is often dubious of Scholem's orienta- tion and conclusions. On the professional level, there appears a thorough repudia- tion of Scholem's grander explanations and interpretations of Jewish mysticism. Beyond those already mentioned are Scholem's treatment of kabbalistic symbol- ism, messianism, and Lurianic kabbalah, all of which are treated in the book. Idel constructs his new perspective upon recent work by a host of second- generation scholars of merkabah mysticism and kabbalah. But there is also a great deal of as yet unsubstantiated guesswork which contributes to Idel's intrepid edifice. Significant theories are backed up with no more than catch-phrases like "it stands to reason that..." or "it seems reasonable to regard...," and the proclamation "I assume" appears with singular frequency in many of Idel's discussions. Substantiations of textual evidence are often few and far between these reconstructive threads. Such are the pitfalls of a reconstructive methodology. The question then ought to be posed: are Idel's assumptions and instincts correct? Certainly in the broadest sense Idel has brought to light valid interpretive models for fathoming Jewish mysticism. No one can seriously undertake the study of Jewish mysticism without taking his hypotheses into account. And his method- ological sophistication, as well as his breadth of knowledge, constitute a welcome blast of fresh air in a field largely given over to the important spade work of philology and text publication. Idel has produced a revolutionary and solid piece of speculative scholarship. Much of Idel's work remains untested and unverified (particularly his reading of antique Judaism), but it can be expected that in the natural give-and-take that will emerge as scholars wrestle with Idel's vision, our understanding of Jewish mysticism will be forever enriched by the appearance of Kabbalah: New Perspectives.
