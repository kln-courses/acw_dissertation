Based on the philosophical insights of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger in particular, this paper points to the importance of the philosophy of the technological in the wake of "autonomous technology" which has reversed the traditional end and-means continuum: means has become end itself. In place of this instrumental rationality, this paper proposes the ethics of responsibility. Just as there is sleepwalking, there is also sleep thinking. — Jose Ortega y Gasset We have indeed become disenchanted with the world whose dominant prose is written in the language of technology and with the postmodern condition of humanity which is enframed by the hegemony of technology including the cybernation of knowledge and the computerization of society. We are all wired to, and become hostages of, the network of technology from which there is no exit in sight. In this setting, it is reasonable to suggest with the late German philosopher of technology, Friedrich Dessauer, that in addition to the three Kantian forms of critique, there should be the fourth, that is, critique of the technological.1 It is quite clear that this new critique will become the most important form of critique in the epoch when technology is totalizing, one 31</page><page sequence="2">32 Autonomous Technology dimensional, planetary, and terribly banal and normalizing, when the fundamental project of macro-technology threatens to create a vast necropolis for the entire earth and bring humankind to the brink of collective extinction or what Jonathan Schell calls "the death of death," and when micro-technology claims to have created our "second self" whose "soul" may soon become, if it has not already become, imprisoned behind the invisible walls of gigantic technological Panopticon. Merleau-Ponty was well aware of the destructive power of technology, although he developed no explicit and systematic philosophy of it. True to his conception of philosophy or philosophical critique as the perpetual vigilance on everything we do, we think, and we know, he began his seminal article, "Eye and Mind" (1961), with a contrast between the concrete art of living and the abstract character of science that manipulates things and rarely comes in contact with the real world of men and women. He observed the emergence of "an entirely new approach," a sort of intellectual fad, as it were, that attempts to master the sciences as autonomous techniques in which thinking is reduced to data-gathering, testing, operating, experimenting, and transforming. Merleau-Ponty thus writes: "Thinking 'opera tionally' has become a sort of absolute artificialism, such as we see in the ideology of cybernetics, where human creations are derived from a natural information process, itself conceived on the model of human machines."2 In operational thinking, in brief, man himself becomes simply another information machine. In Merleau-Ponty we hear a grimmer echo of James Joyce's voice in Ulysses concerning history as a nightmare. Merleau-Ponty continued: "If (operational) thinking were to extend its reign to man and history; if, pretending to ignore what we know of them through our own situations, it were to set out to construct man and history on the basis of a few abstract indices... —then, since man really becomes the manipulandum he takes himself to be, we enter into a cultural regimen where there is neither truth nor falsity concerning man and history, into a sleep, or a nightmare, from which there is no awakening."3 Thus, for Merleau-Ponty, the enemy of human thought or thinking about the human is reductionism—including scientific and technological thinking based on the concept of causality—which is by definition undialectical or incapable of tolerating ambiguity endemic to the multiple structurations of meaning in the human and historical order in the life-world. Merleau-Ponty's thought is interested in preserving at all cost the HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRINQ/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="3">Hwa Yol Jung 33 integrity of what is genuinely or wholly human without reducing it to either artificialism or naturalism: in the former, as in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, the human is reduced to the level of the physical or mechanical, whereas in the latter, as in sociobiology, it is reduced to the level of organic nature. Since the human order is partly physical and partly biological, both artificialism and naturalism are partly valid. That is to say, neither tells the whole truth about human specificity.4 In one of his College de France courses between 1952-1960, moreover, Merleau-Ponty spoke prophetically of the unholy alliance of naturalism and artificialism as "a new prometheism": An extreme naturalism and an extreme artificialism are inextricably associated, not only in the myths of everyday life, but also in the refined myths which arise, for example, out of the theory of information or neo-Darwinism.5 In the recent book entitled Promethean Fire: Reflections on the Origin of Mind (1983), Charles J. Lumsden and Edward O. Wilson propose this "new prometheism" when sociobiology adopts, for example, a mechanistic model with the assumption that moral judgement, too, is a physiological product of the brain and as such it can be simulated by computer science or cybernetics: "sophisticated goals," Lumsden and Wilson insist, "can be built into machines."6 Autonomous technology as the highest form of technological rationality, too, is reductionistic. There is no question that technology is instrumental to the promotion of human well being. By autonomous technology, however, we mean the very transgression of technology as instrumentum or instrumental facilitation. By transgression, I mean the act of overstepping an allotted boundary. This transgression is, as Heidegger would say, the end of Western metaphysics. Indeed, there is no one who cap tures the essence of technology as autonomous better than he when he insists that the essence of technology (Technik) is no longer technological. In the first place, technology is, as it were, an ontological fix rather than instrumental. As such, its end is to replace Being itself or, to use Heidegger's expression, it is the forgetting of Being (Seinsvergessenheit).7 In the second place, to say that the essence of technology is not technological is to say that technology as instrumentum has been transformed into a teleology. Here again, Heidegger's insight into the question of technology is enlightening. He contends that we have yet to grasp HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS — VOL. 12 NO. 2 — SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="4">34 Autonomous Technology fully the nature of technology in which man himself has become its "functionary." That is to say, technology is no longer simply a means to human activity or the human telos. For it is not merely the application of mathematical and physical sciences to praxis, but is rather a praxis itself.8 This is indeed the essence of technology as autonomous in which the traditional end-and means continuum is reversed: means has just become end itself. As such, the traditional rationale of technology as instrumentum is obsolete and anachronistic. Nonetheless, we continue to justify the "end of technology" in terms of this outmoded idea of in strumentum. In so doing, we still view technology as morally neutral and forget that in technology end has already been subverted by means. In today's world which is dominated by technology, this forgetting—the forgetting of the true being of technology as the ontological fix of contemporary humanity everywhere—constitutes the poverty of moral thinking par excellence. This teleological lag shows that the advancement of technology does not guarantee the advancement of moral think ing. The political theorist Langdon Winner calls this happening of technological automony "reverse adaptation" in which Technical systems become severed from the ends originally set for them and, in effect, reprogram themselves and their environments to suit the special condition for their own operation. The artificial slave gradually subverts the rule of its master.9 This anachronistic way of justifying technology as instrumental is an integral part of that historical process which Max Weber called "rationalization" (Zweckrationalitat). Following Friedrich Schiller's expression the "desacralization of nature" (Entgotterung der Natur), Weber called this historical process of rationalization the "disenchantment of the world" (Ent zauberung der Welt) in his famous lecture on "Science as a Voca tion" (Wissenschaft als Beruf) in 1922.10 In relation to our discussion here, Weber's seminal idea of rationalization or the disenchantment of the world, first of all, points to science itself as a motivating force for the progression of modern society and history. Rationalization parallels the historical "progress" of scientific and technological thinking that has displaced the "magical" elements of human thought. It means, according to Weber, that principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="5">Hwa YolJung 35 principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. One need no longer have recourse to magical means in order to master or implore the spirits, as did the savage, for whom such mysterious powers existed. Technical means and calculations perform the service. This above all is what intellectualization means." And Weber continued to say: The fate of our times is characterized by rationaliza tion and intellectualization and, above all, by the 'disenchantment of the world.' Precisely the ultimate and most sublime values have retreated from public life either into the transcendental realm of mystic life or into the brotherliness of direct and personal human relations.12 By undermining or replacing the mystical, cosmic, religious, and moral systems of the past, doesn't this demystification of the "magical" by way of measurable calculation remystify the technical itself? Be that as it may, in the conceptualization of human action, the principle of rationalization reduces the rationality of action to the calculation of the most efficient means of achieving its goals. No wonder, efficiency becomes the opera tional norm of studying human behavior. Second, Weber's idea of rationalization or the disenchantment of the world points to reductionism inherent to scientific and technological thinking based on the concept of causality. Rationalization is indeed an integral part of scientific and technological reduction or, as Merleau-Ponty said in his discussion of the Weberian politics of understanding, the intolerance of the historical Vielseitigkeit, the vectoriality of historical facts which Weberian "liberalism" welcomed in conceiving history as a kind of open notebook in which we must write and rewrite our own events.13 The "rationalization" of the world continues and is exemplified in Marshall McLuhan's philosophy of communica tion and communication technology. Indeed, he is a philosopher of history and culture who is also one of the most outspoken apostles of our age as the age of electronic technology or, shall we say, autonomous technology. What inspires our critical com parison between Merleau-Ponty and McLuhan is that there are some interesting parallels as well as radical differences. Let me mention only two major areas of convergence between the two. HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="6">36 Autonomous Technology First, both focus on the theory of communication whose epicenter is language as (the medium of) communication. For Merleau-Ponty, language is a special cultural object that occupies a privileged position in the perception of other people and things. He has in mind language especially as speech acts. As he says, "speech is the vehicle of our movement toward truth, as the body is the vehicle of our being in the world.'"4 On the other hand, McLuhan's focus on language, whether it be speech or writing, is based on the role it plays as the medium of communication. Nonetheless, both recognize language as playing the central role in the development of man, history, and culture. In the Inaugural Lecture he delivered in 1953 at the College de France, Merleau Ponty hinted at or acknowledged, albeit programmatically, linguistics — more specifically, Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistics — as having the potential of developing into "a new philosophy of history," while McLuhan, under the influence of Harold A. Innis, classified the development of Western civiliza tion into three stages each of which is correlated to the dominant medium of communication: (1) oral, (2) typographic, and (3) electronic. Second, both Merleau-Ponty and McLuhan explore the sociability of the senses whose source is the synergistic body. While most theorists of artificial intelligence and cognitive science justify human cognition as disembodied in the model of the Cartesian Cogito, McLuhan argues for cybernation as em bodied, specifically as tactile. In other words, he focuses on the interplay of the human sensorium and the cultural patterns of communication media. The quintessential line in McLuhan's advocacy of electronic technology is: the medium is the message. For him, "the 'con tent' of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watch-dog of the mind.'"5 The message is contentless because the "content' of any medium is always another medium. For example, the content of writing is the medium of speech; the content of print is the medium of the written word; and the content of the telegraph is the medium of print, etc. What would be, we might ask, the content of the human mind if it is not stuffed with enframed images "processed" by technology? McLuhan embraces the electric light as pure information. Ultimately, electronic technology culminates in "automation" or "cybernation" which makes "the muisic of interrelation" between man and technology. All electronic technology—televi sion in particular—is tactile because electricity is tactile. Unlike HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="7">Hwa Yol Jung 37 mechanical technology (e.g., typography), cybernation whose organizing principle is electricity is not only tactile but also synesthetic: What makes a mechanism is the separation and extension of separate parts of our body as hand, arm, feet, in pen, hammer, wheel. And the mechanization of a task is done by segmentation of each part of an action in a series of uniform, repeatable, and movable parts. The exact opposite characterizes cybernation (or automation), which has been described as a way of thinking, as much as a way of doing. Instead of being concerned with separate machines, cybernation looks at the production prob lem as an integrated system of information handling.16 Interestingly, the contrast between the mechanical and the elec tronic is, for McLuhan, the contrast between Descartes and Heidegger: "Heidegger surf-boards along on the electronic wave as triumphantly as Decartes rode the mechanical wave.'"7 In the following pages, I shall contend that McLuhan's philosophy of communication is a con/fusion of language as the way of communication, which brings serious consequences on the ethics of (1) language and (2) technology.181 will agrue that as the logic of correlation, diatactics is the best way of understand ing the nature of language as both message and medium on the one hand and human communication as both acts and technological facilitation on the other. I borrowed the term diatactics from Hayden White" and extend its meaning to the phenomenological critique of McLuhan. White coined the neologism diatactics in place of dialectics in order to avoid the certain ideological overtone of Marx on the one hand and the transcendental overtone of Hegel on the other. In other words, diatactics is neither "paratactical" (conceptually under determined) nor "hypotactical" (conceptually overdetermined). Since I am concerned here with the notion of language as a system of verbal communication, however, I intend to preserve the original Socratic/Platonic meaning of dia/lectics as the way of dialogue. At any rate, the notion of diatactics as the logic of correlation is at home with the way Merleau-Ponty philoso phized.20 As the logic of correlation, it confirms the ambi/guity of any two (or more) disparate phenomena as complementary or chiasmic. It is—to use one of Merleau-Ponty's expressions—"a unity rich in final convergence and not a unity by reduction to a HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="8">38 Autonomous Technology single order of reality."21 As it is also tactical, the notion of diatactics accommodate McLuhan's emphasis on tactility in relation to electronic technology that epitomizes the ecumenism of the senses. My critique of McLuhan's philosophy of com munication rests on the idea of language as the diatactics of meaning-content (message) and medium. McLuhan's ultimate idea that the medium is the message is undiatactical, that is, in it the unity of human communication is reduced to nothing but the medium. To be sure, language exists for the sake of communication, and expression is the result of man's need and desire to communicate. There are two aspects of the way of language or linguistic expression: one is meaning and the other the medium which are inextricably linked to each other. In this regard, the following point of Heidegger in What Is Called Thinking? is worth noting: "'Way' here means melody, the ring and tone, which is not just a matter of how the saying sounds. The way or how of the saying is the tone from which and to which what is said is attuned."22 Thus language must be understood in terms of the diatactics of the what and the how of linguistic expression which includes the use and aid of artifacts or technological facilitation. By ignoring the what of linguistic communication (i.e., the message), McLuhan makes human communication superflous and the ethics of language untenable. For the conveyance of meaning (the message) rather than the medium is the essence of human communication. He is merely an eloquent mouthpiece of our age as the age of media technology where how to say drowns what to say. When language as perfor mative utterances becomes merely the medium without meaning content, that is, when it becomes "instrumentalized," there is no ethics of language because ethics depends on the intentional activation of meaning (Sinngebung). To say that we are con demned to meaning is to say that we are condemned to moral being. The spoken word carries with it an index of moral sense which presupposes intentional activation, i.e., we say what we mean and we mean what we say. Chinese call it "sincerity" (i.e., the correspondence between what we promise in words and what we perform in action) or "fidelity" (i.e., the accountability of speaking as moral performance or "standing by one's own word"). Moreover, the Confucian formulation of the "rectifica tion of names"—calling things and affairs by their right (rite) names—exemplifies the ethics of language-in-performance. It points to moral orthopedics by the use of "rite" words. Tactility, for McLuhan, points to not only the sociability of HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="9">Hwa YolJung 39 the senses but also the intimate link between man and technology: indeed, it is electronic technology. Electronic teihnoloy as synesthetic tactility promises to confer upon us "a global embrace" and "a perpetuity of collective harmony and peace." For electronic technology is for McLuhan synonymous with the ecumenical movement. McLuhan even considered writing (or, better, calligraphing) his opus magnum, The Gutenberg Galaxy, in the medium of ideography or a galaxy of ideograms. It is indeed "corporeal writing" (ecriture corporelle)—to borrow the expression Stephane Mallarme' used to characterize the Egyptian hieroglyphics. As the ideogram is "a mask of corporate energy," calligraphy, too, is a kinetic techne as the movement by the hand of corporeal energy. Heidegger whom McLuhan allegedly surf-boards on the electronic wave, too, refers to the hand (the primary organ of tactility) as a techne: the "craft" of writing (calligraphing), typing, painting, playing piano, sculpturing, etc. As such, the hand is for Heideg ger peculiarly human." In addition to many ways of what is com monly know as handicraft, Heidegger stresses thinking itself as the inculcation of "handicraft": ...the hand's gestures run everywhere through language, in their most perfect purity precisely when man speaks by being silent. And only when man speaks, does he think — not the other way around, as metaphysics still believes. Every motion of the hand in every one of its works carries itself through the ele ment of thinking, every bearing of the hand bears itself in that element. Therefore, thinking itself is man's simplest, and for that reason hardest, han diwork, if it would be accomplished at its proper time.24 However, there is a radical difference between the way of the human hand as "handicraft" and the anthropomorphization of technology in terms of tactility. The latter is McLuhan's way of characterizing electronic technology. For him, it is not the body as the subject of the sensorium that "touches" television, but television that "touches" the human subject when he describes television, for example, as tactile. It is quite clear that McLuhan's metaphorical invocation of tactility for television aims to enhance the power of its anthropomorphic intimacy as (the medium of) communication.25 When the medium is proclaimed to be the message in human communication and when it is not HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 19S5</page><page sequence="10">40 Autonomous Technology speech or writing, McLuhan is anthropomorphizing (media) technology." Once technology becomes anthropomorphized as tactile, moreover, we no longer understand, that is, we confuse, the peculiar diatactics of perception and culture or what Merleau Ponty calls the cultural dilatation of perception. He speaks of the simultaneity of the openness of perception to the cultural world and the openness of the cultural world to perception. In other words, the "descending" order of the invisible into the visible is that "perceptual pregnancy" which is the informing of percep tion by culture or a learning of the ecological milieu including the subworld of the technological or artificial. In short, the "ra tionalization" of the world by technocratic mentality, in princi ple, makes impossible the deconstruction of technology (as well as science) as an established "ideology" or, for that matter, a futuristic "utopia."27 In the case of McLuhan in particular, by "instrumentalizing" the message by means of the medium, that is, by short-circuiting the differentia between the human and the technological, he ignores—he cannot do otherwise—the "ideological" contents of the modern world for which technology serves.28 In the final analysis, there can be no ethics in autonomous technology, because it makes obsolete and anachronistic the traditional rationale of technology as instrumentum or instrumental facilitation that serves the telos of man. The reversal of ends and means is endemic to technocratic mentality and characteristic peculiarly of autonomous technology. It is an integral and indispensable part of "rationalization" or the "disenchantment of the world" accompanied by the rise and dominance of scientific and technological thinking (i.e., thinking by calculation). To "rationalize" or "instrumentalize" ends is to norm/alize "efficiency" as the end of our conduct — the opera tional demand of modern technocracy or technocratic mentality. The "rationalization" or "instrumentalization" of our conduct is the end of the Kingdom of Ends. The reverse side of this "in strumentalization" is the moral truism or naive moralism that "guns don't kill people; only people kill people." The instrumentalization of ends raises the celebrated question of the "banality of evil" those opposite is the ethics of respon sibility. The "banality of evil" is the profound idea Hannah Arendt coined in order to characterize Adolf Eichmann as the paradigmatic case of the violent terror of unthinking men and to justify the death penalty imposed on him by the Israeli Govern ment in 1962. For Arendt, Eichmann as doer was neither HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="11">Hwa Yol Jung 41 monstrous nor demonic, but the result of his deed was so, indeed. So Arendt's idea of the "banality of evil" can very well be applied to the even unintended "evil" consequences of technology. Moral thinking, responsible thinking, is characteristic of men and women as humans. The possibility of moral thinking depends on the notion that we are responsible agents. We have already above noted that rational, ethical conduct presupposes, as it is demanded by phenomenological reflection, the intentional activation of meaning. To be responsible is to choose one mean ing or value over others in the configuration of both ends and means. This configuration underscores phenomenological reflec tion on ethics or, to use the expression of Simone de Beauvoir, the "ethics of ambiguity" as opposed to "absurdity." She declares: The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdi ty challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man's condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness to save his existence.29 Because it is undiatactical, that is, it seeks a unity by reduction to a single order of meaning or value, autonomous technology can not ipso facto tolerate any ambiguity or what Weber called the Vielseitigkeit of historical facts. As such, autonomous technology is condemned to "absurdity" exactly in the sense de Beauvoir uses the term. And absurdity is a nihilism in disguise. Merleau-Ponty emphasizes: "History has no meaning, if this meaning is understood as that of a river which, under the influence of all-powerful causes, flows towards an ocean in which it disappears. Every appeal to universal history cuts off the mean ing of the specific event, renders effective history insignificant, and is a nihilism in disguise."30 The ethics of responsibility, however, must not be identified with an ethics of pure intention and principles. Nor should it be confused with an ethics of consequences with disregard for inten tion and principles. Both are undiatcatical because they are one HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 1985</page><page sequence="12">42 Autonomous Technology sided: by focusing on intention and principles alone, one loses sight of consequences, whereas weighing only consequences, the other forgets intention and principles. The ethics of responsibility must be an ethics of fulfillment in that it fulfills the principled intention of an action in light of the consequences it produces or will produce, whether it be verbal or nonverbal. We do not have to go as far as invoking the uncommon jurisprudential principle that technology is guilty until proven innocent! The "banality of evil" points to the "guilt" or liability of technology despite its "innocent," "benign," or "good" intention to serve humanity's well-being. Quite often, good intentions produce bad conse quences. In a different context, in the context of politics, specifically of Marxian politics, Merleau-Ponty declares: We said that a policy cannot be justified by its good intentions. Still less can it be justified by barbarous intentions. We have never said that any policy which succeeds is good. We said that in order to be good a policy must succeed. We have never said that success justifies everything. We said that failure is a fault and in politics one does not have the right to make errors and that only success can turn what was at first audacity and faith into solid reason. The curse of politics is precisely that it must translate values into the order of facts. At the level of action, every desire is as good as foresight and , reciprocally, every prog nostic is a kind of complicity. A policy therefore can not be grounded in principle, it must also com prehend the facts of the situation. It was said long ago that politics is the art of the possible. That does not suppress our intiative: since we do not know the future, we have only, after carefully weighing everything, to push in our direction. But that reminds us of the gravity of politics; it obliges us, instead of simply forcing our will, to look hard among the facts for the shape they should take.31 In sum: to reenchant the world, to deconstruct technology is to restore the essence of man as moral being. Or else, history will indeed by a nightmare from which there is no awakening. When we become "cybernated," the cycle of our body's life as an inser tion into and out of this earth, this world—the cycle of birth, copulation, and death, as T.S. Eliot has it—will cease to exist. This is the nihilism implied in, and the end of, autonomous HUMBOLDT JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RELATIONS - VOL. 12 NO. 2 - SPRING/SUMMER 198S</page><page sequence="13">Hwa YolJung 43 technology.

Heidegger observes the totalization and one-dimensionality of technology as the ontological fix of modern man everywhere when he writes: "What now is, is marked by the dominance of the active nature of modern technology. This dominance is already representing itself in all areas of life, by various identifiable traits such as functionalization, systematic improve ment, automation, bureaucratization, communications. Just as we call the idea of living things biology, just so the presentation and full articulation of all beings, dominated as they now are everywhere by the nature of the technical, may be called technology. The expression may serve as a term for the metaphysics of the atomic age. Viewed from the present and drawn from our insight into the present, the step back out of metaphysics into the essential nature of metaphysics is the step out of technology and technological description and interpreta tion of the age, into the essence of modern technology which is still to be thought."

Morris Berman takes up on this Weberian theme of the disenchantment of the world and proposes the transformation of it in The Reenchantment of the World (Ithaca: Cornell Univeristy Press, 1981). Sheldon Wolin also uses the Weberian idea of the disenchantment of the world in order to do an interesting critique of "postmodern politics" in "Postmodern Politics and the Absence of Myth," Social Research, 52 (Summer, 1985):217-239. 11.
