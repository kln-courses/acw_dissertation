<plain_text><page sequence="1">Environment, Culture, and Ethics. An African Concept of Evil Charles C. VERHAREN* RÉSUMÉ Cheikh Anta Diop émit l'hypothèse que l'environnement n'est sans doute pas étranger à l'unité culturelle de l'Afrique . Il n'était d'ailleurs pas le premier ; car d'Aristote à Hegel on a toujours pensé que l'envi- ronnement modelait le comportement culturel. Même si cette hypothèse est plus philosophique que scientifique, il semble intéressant d'en établir au moins la validité philosophique et par la suite la légitimité scientifique, si besoin est. Il s'agit donc de tenter de déterminer si l'hypothèse de C.A. Diop a quelque fondement et cela à travers l'étude du concept du mal (evil) dans différents systèmes indo-européens d'une part, africains (égyptien et dogon) d'autre part. Dans la limite des recherches effectuées dans ce domaine, seuls des faits généraux peuvent être établis : ainsi les cultures eurasiennes étu- diées montrent en général une vision du futur où les forces du mal sont annihilées tandis que les deux cultures africaines qui servent de réfé- rences trouvent la signification de la vie dans le présent et n'imaginent pas que le mal sera vaincu. Une démarcation culturelle suivant les latitudes semblerait exister et donner raison à C.A. Diop, mais les causes de cette démarcation peuvent être autres que celles qu'il pose en hypothèse. Jared Diamond pense que la technologie, plus que la latitude, est un agent de différen- ciation culturelle. En somme, l'article établit par des détours philosophico-éthico-spé- culatifs le bien-fondé de toute recherche et de celle de C.A.

Why did Europeans colonize Africa? Why not the other way around ? Are Europeans more aggressive, more pessimistic than Afri- cans ? Cheikh Anta Diop hypothesizes that the harsh Northern cradle of civilization fueled European imperialism (1990, p. 144-197 ; 1991, p. 211-219). Environment cannot be the sole explanation of cultural behavior, however. For Diop, Africans can be as aggressive as Europeans : « The black race, historically, subjugated the white race for 3,000 years» (1991, p. 65). Nevertheless, Diop insists that environ- mental considerations may explain continental cultural unity. Critics like Anthony Appiah (1992) dismiss Diop's hypotheses about northern and southern cradles of civilization and African cultu- ral unity. If language is a primary carrier of culture, how can a conti- nent that contains one fourth of the world's six thousand languages be said to express a cultural unity ? Mary Lefkowitz ridicules Diop for claiming that Plato's optimism must have an African origin « be- cause Indo-Europeans are generally pessimistic (!) » (1996, p. 152). However, Diop has distinguished predecessors who argue that environment shapes culture. Like Aristotle before him, Hegel claimed that the world's frigid and torrid zones are « too powerful to allow Spirit to build up a world for itself » (1956, p. 80). Such arguments continue to the present. Alfred Crosby in Ecological Imperialism : The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 (1988), and Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel : The Fates of Human Societies (1997), have argued that environmental conditions dictate cultural behavior. Like Diop, none of these authors seeks genetic explanations for cultural differentiation. Diop believes that « there is no particular glory about the cradle of humanity being in Africa, because it is just an accident. If the physical conditions of the planet had been other- wise, the origin of humanity would have been different » (1991, p. 16). Even the original dispositions imparted to a culture by its environ- ment may change under contrary cultural pressures. While their en- vironments originally oriented Africans toward communal philoso- phies, for example, Africans subjected to colonial pressures « experience strongly individualistic consciousness, with all of the usual consequences » (1991, p. 218). Nonetheless, Diop argues that a culture's original disposition is environmentally based. This origi- nal disposition will show itself in a culture's foundations, particularly its ontology and axiology. Because of its highly general and speculative character, Diop's hypothesis is more philosophical than scientific. However, establish- ing philosophical plausibility is the first step on the path to a legiti- mate scientific research program. This essay will contrast African</page><page sequence="3">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 49 and Eurasian concepts of evil to determine whether Diop's « two cra- dle » hypothesis merits further research. The conclusion will show how Diamond's recent work supports Diop's hypothesis in a surpri- sing way. For Diamond, climate is only one of many factors causing cultural differentiation. But both Diop and Diamond agree that the fate of humanity depends on our ability to understand why cultures take such different forms. The essay's methodology, like that of much of Diop's work, is philosophical in Alain Locke's sense of proposing « a panoramic world view or life view... [T]he philosopher is not concerned, like the scientist, with details primarily, but with overall relationships » (1989, p. 103). Like frontier scouts, philosophers explore the trac- kless terrain between artistic reveries and empirical analyses in search of promising scientific hypotheses. Latitude and Attitude Diop's hypothesis about latitude and moral attitude is so overly general as to be untestable. Taking the first steps toward making the hypothesis the object of a research program, the essay will contrast three Eurasian cultures with two African cultures to reveal an ele- ment of pessimism in northern attitudes toward life. These attitudes become apparent in a reflection on the distinctions that cultures make between good and evil. The most ancient history of the meaning of the term « sin » sug- gests that evil lies at the heart of existence in Indo-European cultu- res. The word « sin » has its proto-Indo-European etymology in the root word « es » which has the basic meaning of « existence » or « being ». If, as Wittgenstein says, a language is a form of life, then Indo-European lives and languages suggest that « to be » is « to be sinful ». Three Indo-European religions that have had great effect not only on Indo-Europeans but also the wider world all claim that existence as we know and live it is imperfect if not tainted. Hinduism, Budd- hism, Christianity are pessimistic in insisting that life is saturated with limitation1. For these philosophies, reality as we experience it is a pale shadow of a higher, more perfect world - a life beyond the illusions of our senses for the Hindus, beyond the torture of unful- filled desires for the Buddhists, beyond the delights of the flesh for the Christians. In these religions our lives have their centers outside of life as we know and live it - in moksha for the Hindus, nirvana for the Budd- 1. Christianity is not Indo-European in origin, but it has flowered in a European context. See Koller (1997) for comparative summaries of Hinduism and Buddhism. For translations of original texts in these traditions, see C. Moore and S. Radhakrishnan (1967).</page><page sequence="4">50 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE hists, paradise for the peoples of the Book. All three northern sys- tems isolate evil as an aberrant aspect of the universe that can be finally overcome - by God's divine power in the case of Biblical peo- ples, or by transcendent forms of consciousness in the case of the Hindus and Buddhists. However, evil is rooted in life, and humans can extirpate evil only by going beyond life. These three systems localize evil and some of them personify it as well. Desire is the source of evil Buddhism, maya the source in Hinduism, and Satan the source in the Bible. The concept of evil is famously personalized in the three religions of the Book - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam2. In the two African systems 1 will discuss, one ancient Egyptian and the other Dogon, evil is neither personified nor localized. Far from being a principle that can be overcome by God's grace or a transcendant consciousness, evil is woven into the fabric of the uni- verse, utterly indispensable. Evil is not a force that exists indepen- dently of good, always struggling against it in a Manichean way. Ra- ther evil is disorder or chaos, the complementary principle of order. Eurasian and ancient Egyptian concepts of evil appear to be quite different. In the former, good and evil are opposing forces, radically different kinds of existences, while in the latter they are complemen- tary, parts of a whole that can only be falsely divided. In at least some Eurasian cultures, then, evil is the enemy, the other, to be destroyed utterly. In ancient Egypt, evil is a necessary part of being itself, not a friend, but the raw material of life to be transformed into beauty and harmony. The two concepts of evil appear to be as separeted by ontology as the continents that gave birth to them are separated by degrees of latitude. However, Diop claims that African philosophies are the foundations of European philosophies (Diop, 1991, 337-358). Were the two concepts closer in earlier times ? Their sharpest point of difference is that ancient Egyptians do not personify evil. Interestingly, Elaine Pagels claims that Satan was not personified in earlier Jewish texts. The term « the satan » descri- bed an « adversarial role » rather than an individual being. Sixth cen- tury BCE Hebrew storytellers used the term to refer to « any one of the angels sent by God for the specific purpose of blocking or obs- tructing human activity. The root stn means « one who opposes, obs- tructs, or acts as an adversary ». (The Greek term diabolos , later translated « devil », literally means « one who throws something across one's path ») (1995, p. 39). As internecine strife heated up among Semitic peoples, « Satan » gradually began to acquire a per- sona that could be localized by enterring into human beings. Such « demonization » gave political figures religious or ethical justifica- tions for dispatching their perceived enemies. The concept of evil, far from denoting a disordered state as in 2. See Pagels (1995) for an account of the origin of this personalization.</page><page sequence="5">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 51 the ancient Egyptian system, becomes a political weapon. By the time of the Holy Roman Empire (962 CE), Satan is well-established as a self-conscious, self-designated rival for God's power whose in- fluence on humans must be a primary source of their misery. Could an ancient African concept of evil have given birth to the Judaeo-Christian concept ? The early Jewish idea of the satan as an obstruction of the good rather than an evil persona might justify research on this question. But other evidence should point to African origins of the Judaeo-Christian concept of evil. If, as Diop suggests, African philosophy had a strong influence on European philosophy, we should expect to see syncretic philoso- phies along the margins of the two cultures. An example of a concept of evil that fuses Judaeo-Christian and Egyptian ideas can be found in the work of the African philosopher, St. Augustine, who lived in the fourth and fifth centuries CE in what is now Tunisia. A Manichean before he converted to Christianity, St. Augustine orginally held a concept of evil that was similar in at least one way to an ancient Egyptian concept3. Evil was a force that coexisted with good. Unlike the Egyptians, however, Augustine believed that the universe was a battleground between good and evil. When he conver- ted to Christianity, Augustine came to believe that evil was the ab- sence of good rather than a force with an independent existence. He resisted Orthodox Christian efforts to personalize evil in the figure of Satan. While Augustine used Satan's name in ecclesiastical ceremonies to represent a king of mythological figure, he argued that « ontologi- cally speaking, evil and Satan do not exist » (Pagels, 1995, p. 182). Valentinus, an earlier African philosopher who emigrated from Egypt to Rome around 140 CE, was an heretical (the term comes from the Greek hairesis , « choice ») Christian thinker who professed an ontology quite similar to the ancient Egyptian. Valentinus' follo- wers held that the God of Genesis was neither the sole God nor the head of a band of fallen angels, as some heretical Christian sects argued. The God of Genesis is « an anthropomorphic image of the true divine Source underlying all being, the ineffable, indescribable source Valentinus calls "the Depth", or "the abyss" » (Pagels, 1995, p. 160-161, p. 169). The Valentinian Gospel of Philip, discovered at Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt in 1945 (Pagels, 1995, 7) declares that good and evil are not cosmic opposites. To the contrary, the author of Philip claims that « what we identify as opposites - "light and dark, life and death, 3. Establishing correlations between Persian (Manes' homeland) and ancient Egyptian concepts of evil would require a substantial research program. Such a pro- gram should include comparative research on ancient Egyptian elements in Hellenistic and classical Roman thought in such figures as Valentinus (120 ?-165 ? CE), Origen (185 ?-254 ? CE), Plotinus (205 ?-270 ? CE), and Augustine (354-430 CE).

Writing in the second century CE, Valentinus was much more li- kely to have access to ancient Egyptian thought that was not com- pletely distorted by Greek and Roman influences. An Ancient Egyptian Concept of Evil In the ancient Egyptian cosmology presented in The Book of the Dead , the universe starts in the chaotic watery abyss of Nun4. Through self-containted evolutionary principles called Khepera, Nun creates forces of energy and consciousness like Ra. Ra in turn creates the lesser gods of earth, air, fire, and water which then create an- thropomorphic gods such as Isis and Osiris. These gods in their turn create humans. After the universe as we know it has run its course, chaos or Apophis the serpent swallows the universe which then re- turns to a chaotic state. Apophis , however, is the ouroboros , the en- circling snake that eats itself, thereby creating the universe anew. While we might wonder whether Apophis is the very serpent that slithered its way into the Garden of Eden, we can be sure that the serpent is the perfect figure of evil in ancient Egypt. The ancient Egyptians had a heaven to look forward to when they died, but their heaven was no safe haven from evil. Death visited not only the mortal souls in heaven but the gods themselves. As chapter 175 of the Book of the Dead puts it, Ra himself will be transformed into the snake, the figure of evil : « This earth will return to the pri- meval water (Nun ), to endless (flood) as in its first state. 1 shall re- main with Osiris after 1 have transformed myself into another snake which men do not know and the gods do not see » (cited in Hornung, 1981, p. 163). Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead also indicates that Ra springs from « ... the snakes, out of whose dwelling 1 came, out of the Nun where 1 was among the dispirited, no place was found for me where I could stand up... » (quoted in Diop, 1991, p. 329). Heaven is hardly an omega point where perfection may be achie- ved and all evil destroyed, since not only the souls in heaven but also the gods will suffer a return to chaos. Orientation toward a hea- ven in the future has a proper place in the Egyptian ethical life, but it is not the primary source of value in their system. 4. The cosmological account that follows is based on Diop (1991), Hornung (1982, 1990), and Allen (1988, 1989). The uniformity of three distinct Egyptian cosmologies - Theban, Heliopolitan, and Memphite - leads Allen to argue that rather than « being competing systems of thought (such as those of the early Greek philosophers), the Egyptians creation accounts are facets of a persistently uniform understanding of what the universe is and how it came to be » (1988, p. 63). Allen's thesis departs from earlier scholarship claiming that the three cosmologies were competitors, « each trying to establish the superiority of its own cosmogony at the expense of the others » (1988, p. 62). See also Assman (1989).</page><page sequence="7">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 53 Evil is not a principle that has an independent existence, as in the case of Satan ; rather it is simply disorder. Gods like Seth that are used as analogues for Satan famously perform both good and evil acts ; they are never utterly destroyed in moral combat, but al- ways appear again5. The source of disorder is not a being whose principle occupation is to sow disorder, but the very nature of exis- tence itself. Both order and disorder have their appropriate stations. In the beginning of the universe, disorder rules. As the universe unfolds through the potential of Khepera and manifests itself in the energy and consciousness of Ra, order displaces disorder. But chaos always has the potential to break through harmony. Human virtue, however, just like divine virtue, can restore balance when it has been distur- bed. And the eternal circle of the serpent is the perfect figure of universal harmony and balance. The perfect order of Ma' ai is made possible only through the chaos of Apophis. The Egyptologist Erik Hornung claims that Egyptian mastery of the balance between order and chaos is the source of its creativity : « Scarcely any other civilization has integrated the nonexistent and its creative potentially so perfectly into its way of life, acknowledging the nonexistent without falling prey to it » (1981, p. 184). Fearful of painting too rosy a picture of evil and the nonexistent, Hornung also points out that it has a « negative, corrosive, deadly side... The Egyptians are aware that every personal being, including the gods, must die ; but they... remain detached and balanced, and avoid falling into nihilism... » (Hornung, 1981, p. 185). Evil in human conduct results in undifferentiated states. The consequences of evil are not superimposed by a divine judge (al- though a divine judge guards the gates of the hereafter). Good is defined as an aspect of Ma'at or divine order and balance. A life organized to patterns that preserve the flow of life is a good life. A life out of balance, a life that violates these patterns, will finally dis- integrate and return to the formless void. A Dogon Concept of Evil Is the ancient Egyptian concept of evil restricted to ancient Egypt, 5. Cf. Erik Hornung, The Valley of the Kings : Horizon of Eternity, p. 107 : « ... Seth himself overcomes the serpentine monster Apophis, thus using his incredible strength in the service of the Creation ; but he also disturbs and threatens it with the murder of Osiris, his own brother. Apophis appears to share some of this ambiguity with Seth. Apophis is not simply the principle of evil ; the Egyptians always suspected that the complex interwoven structures of the world could not be reduced to the dualistic system of good and evil. The chaotic and shapeless nothing from which Apophis emerges, and into which he always returns, threatens the order of the creator. But it includes all the elements that Creation requires for its own perpetuation and regene- ration. »</page><page sequence="8">54 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE or distributed more broadly in Africa ? Scholars like Diop argue that ancient Egypt's cultural influence extended to other parts of Africa (1991, p. 313-326). The Fulani peoples in West Africa have a tradition that they migrated from Egypt to their present homelands thousands of years ago (Lam, 1996, 1994, 1993). Water symbols on the right and left sides of the Dogon peoples' famous granary doors imply a belief in the universe's beginning and ending in a watery abyss. Many of the doors also exhibit a snake, and Dogon informants have told me that the symbol is analogous to the Egyptian Apophis. Marcel Griaule and Germaine Dieterlen's anthropological studies (1977, 1983, 1986, esp. 285-293) suggest strong analogies between the ancient Egyptian and Dogon concepts of evil. For the Dogon, evil is complementary to good, and existence permits only their admixture, never their separation or elimination. Evil exists both in nature and in human action. Humans must learn how to contend with evil, but they can never eliminate it. Radical action taken to eliminate evil will engender further, more grievous evil. No extensive research has compared the ancient Egyptian and Dogon cultures in general or their concepts of evil in particular6. Griaule and Dieterlen's work fuels speculation on similarities bet- ween the two cultures' cosmologies and axiologies. Finding out whe- ther possible analogues are due to cultural diffusion or independent origination will require an extraordinary research commitment. As anyone who has recently visited mosques and chapels in remote Dogon villages can attest, the window for this kind of research is swiftly closing. Is the Dogon concept of evil more optimistic than the Indo- European alternatives ? This question is so philosophical that any answer must be purely speculative. The dominant hermeneutic we have of the Dogon culture is European. Griaule and Dieterlen, the primary European anthropologists who present it to us, have their own cultural presuppositions. Their own « scientific » critiques of Eu- ropean culture may have led them to create a simulacrum disguised as an African culture. Even worse, their anthropological methodo- logy of intermittent visitation leaves much to be desired. Is Diop Right about Attitude and Wrong about Latitude ? To summarize the argument to this point, some Eurasian cultures fixate on glorious visions of a future, whether heaven or moksha or nirvana , where the forces of evil have been finally overcome. The two African cultures we have examined are optimistic about the fu- 6. See also Calame-Griaule (1986) and Tchimou (1995).</page><page sequence="9">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 55 ture but they find life meaningful in the present moment. They could not imagine that we shall overcome evil. Given the limited amount of research available on these issues, such statements are over- generalizations, but their aim is to suggest lines for further research, rather than to assert truth claims. Finding sharp differences between Eurasian and African concepts of evil might seem to support Diop's hypothesis about cultural de- marcation along lines of latitude. However, Diop may be right about attitude but wrong about latitude. Qualitative differences between African and Eurasian technologies may have led to differences in ethical systems. Complex, pervasive technology may have led nor- thern cultures into thinking that what is undesirable or evil may be eliminated, and that the future will disclose a utopia in which all evil will be destroyed. Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs , and Steel makes a case for techno- logy as a principal agent of cultural differentiation. As we saw above, both Diop and Diamond believe that environmental factors differen- tiate cultures, but Diamond pays attention to biogeographical details - germs, speciation, range, and agricultural technology, for exam- ple - that were not available to Diop. For Diamond, the reason why Africans did not colonize Eurasia or the Americas « had nothing to do with differences between Euro- pean and African peoples themselves, as white racists assume. Ra- ther, it was due to accidents of geography and biogeography » (1997, p. 400-401). Using physical and linguistic evidence, Diamond argues that Bantu peoples displaced Twa (Pygmy) and Khoisan peoples from their original territories in central and east Africa because the Bantu mastered agriculture7. The Twa and Khoisan could not make a transition from hunting and gathering because central and sou- thern Africa's indigenous plants and animals « were mostly unsuita- ble for domestication » (1997, p. 389). Under Diamond's hypothesis, Bantus could « engulf » (1997, p. 397) Africa from the Congo to The Cape for the same kinds of reasons that Europeans colonized Africa, Asia, and the Americas. On this hypothesis, the environmental cards a culture is dealt determine its future. The most important initial consideration is a culture's abi- lity to feed itself. Africans, according to Diamond, were dealt a poor hand. Europeans, however, were blessed with an abundant variety of plants and animals, especially large animals, that could be domes- ticated. Plant and animal technology could sweep from one end of the Eurasian continent to the other because the continental axis has an 7. For « correlations between linguistic and archaeological evidence of Africa's past », Diamond (1997, p. 454) cites C. Ehret and M. Posnansky, eds., The Archaeolo- gical and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History (Berkeley : University of California Press, 1982). Diamond compromises his scholarship by substituting bibliographical reviews for scholarly notation. On African linguistic diffusion, see also Renfrew (1992, 1994) and Ruhlen (1991).</page><page sequence="10">56 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE east-west orientation. Africa's north-south axis prevented such dif- fusion because of temperature and disease barriers. Cattle herding technology advanced very slowly from northern to southern Africa because of the tse-tse fly barrier, for example (see Diamond, 1997, p. 164, 186, 400). Advanced food technology allowed Indo-Europeans to dominate their part of the continent, with only tiny islands of non- Indo-European speaking populations, like the Basques, Hungarians, and Finns, remaining. In a relatively short period of time, large European populations were concentrated in small areas. Because Europeans tended to live with their animals, diseases concentrated in farm fowl and animals spread like wildfire. Immunized survivors of bubonic plague and smallpox became deadly vectors of germ warfare. Large populations and abundant food supply gave Europeans ample leisure to develop complex technologies (See Diamond, 1997, p. 83-292). Chinese and Indians were « blessed » with similar opportunities, but geographical factors retarded their technologies. The Chinese empire's general political stability did not foster competitiveness and war technology. While the Chinese were the first non-Africans to round the Cape of Good Hope a few decades before Vasco de Gama, political strife brought long-range Chinese exploration to a sudden halt8. Europeans, perpetually at war because of Europe's fractal geo- graphy, rapidly outpaced other cultures on the Eurasian continent with respect to war and transport technologies (see Diamond, 1997, p. 322-333). Diamond shares with Diop a taste for highly generalized and spe- culative thinking. Testing their claims will require extensive research in archaeology, linguistics, genetics, and a host of combinant disci- plines like biogeography. However, their hypotheses have important consequences for the field of ethics. The Ethical Consequences of Diamond's Hypo- thesis If technology rather than latitude shapes cultures, can we argue that a culture's ethics should correlate with its technologies ? By reason of its control function, technology focuses a culture's atten- tion on the future. Pervasive technologies cause cultures to assume that the future will be shaped by human actions. On this hypothesis, the future rather than the present tends to dominate consciousness. The center of a culture is displaced into the future and what disturbs its members in the present is envisioned as eliminated in the future. 8. Diamond cites Louise Levathes' When China Ruled the Seas (New York ; Simon and Schuster, 1994) on Chinese maritime history.</page><page sequence="11">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 57 Culture is no longer centered in life as we live it, but in some shadowy future that cannot be specified. Utopia, far from being an idle reflection, becomes the central preoccupation of the culture. What prevents utopia from being realized in the present will be eli- minated in the future. Is the hypothesis of culture and a fortiori ethics being shaped by technology in any way plausible ? Martin Heidegger has argued at lenght that technology has come to the brink of destroying European culture : « man, precisely as the one so threatened, exalts himself to the posture of the lord of the earth » (« The Question Concerning Technology », 1977, p. 308). This 20th century « lordship » derives in part from technological prowess in reconstructing experience : « ... the illusion comes to prevail that everything man encounters exists only insofar as it is his construct... Heisenberg has... pointed out that the real must present itself to contemporary man in this way » (ibid.). Heidegger associates technology with calculative thinking (see « The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking », 1977, p. 373-392). Such thinking concentrates on an object only for the purpose of seeing its usefulness for some other object. Attention glances off everything already present before us into an imagined future that cannot have the reality of the present moment. In focusing our at- tention on what can be never fully present to our attention, we make it impossible for what exists, Being , to reveal itself to us. For Heidegger, the root of the problem is technology. In transfor- ming what exists ready to hand into something else, we concentrate on the uses of objects rather than objects in themselves. In cultures completely focused on technology, humans themselves become ob- jects for transformation, valuable only for what they may become, rather than what they are. Heidegger came to this philosophy of technology late in life, after observing the effects of technology run amok in the Second World War. Cultures saturated in technology find good, « ethical » reasons to demonize, enslave, and destroy the cultural « other ». Research Motives : Apologia Pro Vita Sua ? Both Heidegger and Diamond's research suggests that technology may be not only an efficient but also a final cause of aggression. Their work may be read as an apology for European imperialism. Diamond, for example, argues that Europeans are unique in « engul- fing» other cultures only by reason of scale (1997, 405-425). If his argument is correct, Europeans may claim that environmental forces have shaped their histories. Nothing in Diamond's work indicates that his intention is to dis- place guilt, however. He has stated that a primary motive for under- taking his research on the fates of human societies is concern about</page><page sequence="12">58 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE whether the world will be fit for human habitation in the near future (« Guns, Germs, and Steel : The Fates of Human Societies », National Academy of Science lecture, October 27, 1997). The conclusion of Guns , Germs , and Steel (1997, p. 405-425) expresses Diamond's hope of moving the discipline of history in the direction of rigorous science. If history were to assume the mantle of an applied science, then we might use it to help change the course of what appears to be inevitable. Diamond's project is premature at best. History as an academic discipline focuses on particularity rather than generalization. What Diamond requires is a completely new methodology for history that fuses the natural and social sciences into a new syncretistic « super- science ». History has always aspired to this status, as its proto-Indo- European etymology reveals. The « is » in « history », like the same root in « wisdom », denotes the power of our longest-range sense, « vision ». Hoping to predict humanity's future through their rumina- tions, philosophers like Hegel and Marx have claimed this long-range vision from the side of philosophy's power of abstraction. Diamond would seize his own vision of the future from the side of history's concentration on detail. The success of Diamond's quest for a « super-method » is even more problematic than contemporary physicists' searches for a « grand unifying theory » or « theory of everything ». Such theories aim « only » at a unification of the four known physical forces - gra- vitational, electromagnetic, nuclear weak and strong. Diamond's dream of unifying the physical and social sciences resonates with Edward O. Wilson's (1998) ambition to include even the humanities in a marvelous feat of « consilience » of all branches of learning. Their hopes are immodest but philosophical to the core. Diop's attempts to connect history to the future are much less pretentious. For Diop, history serves as an inspiration for formula- ting hypotheses about our choices concerning the « fates of huma- nity ». If, for example, history suggests that all humans move in the direction of barbarism, given the requisite circumstances, then per- haps history might stimulate us to choose civilization over barba- rism, in Diop's senses of those terms : « An... African optimism incli- nes us to wish that all nations would join hands in order to build a planetary civilization instead of sinking down to barbarism » (1991, p. 7). If history appears to confirm the idea that all humans have the same basic dispositions, then we have one more reason to form a universal human community, in the spirit of Africans like Diop and African Americans like Fanon (1967, p. 232). Knowing ourselves in both philosophical and scientific senses will lead, in Diop's words, to « the worldwide dissemination of information that forces the ethi- cal conscience of humanity to stick to "acceptable" limits, in the absence of radical change » (1991, p. 376).</page><page sequence="13">ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, AND ETHICS. AN AFRICAN CONCEPT OF EVIL 59 Justifying a Research Program : A Plausible Hy- pothesis ? The epistemological problems of the kind of research that Diop and Diamond and Hegel and Aristotle before than have done are massive. Natural scientists who make generalizations over narrow areas of experience under carefully controlled conditions are reluc- tant to distinguish among causes, conditions, and correlations. In attempting to make a science out of history, like Diamond, or to project history into the future, like Diop, we trample the bounds of conventional scientific wisdom. Controversial, speculative, founda- tional, and general, Diop and Diamond's work is philosophical rather than scientific, despite all efforts to ground it in science. However, part of philosophy's role is to carve a path for science. We cannot now claim to know the correlations between environment and ethics. But we can advance the hypothesis that there is a causal correlation between technology and ethics. And we can hypothesize that overdeveloped technologies create ethical systems that lead cultures in the direction of imperialism (Winner, 1986). If technolo- gized cultures threaten, even if unwittingly, the very existence of life on earth, they must be stopped. But by what method ? Understan- ding the formation of such cultures must be the first step. Shall we use technology to stop technology ? Or shall we destroy technology to stop technology ? We cannot know how to proceed unless we understand the phenomenon itself. Straddling the indeter- minate border between wild speculation and consensual knowledge claims, between myth and science, philosophy can only plead for more research. Working on the margins of extreme uncertainty, ho- wever, philosophy must make convincing arguments about the most promising lines of research. Part of Diop's rationale for his research is his conviction that « the future of humanity is at stake » (1991, p. 375). Diop does not imagine that technology can or even should be stopped. In fact, he thinks that a technology imbued with African optimism might even lead us to « terraform » the planets to spread human life (1990, p. 197). But some forms of technology are inherently dangerous. While he belie- ves that humans will be able to transform their own life-forms, that very act of creation would endanger the creator (1991, p. 366). Diop calls for a new ethics grounded in science, particularly the science of ecology (1991, p. 375). It is ironic that Diop should claim that science, the very discipline that led to the nuclear technology now threatening life on earth, should be the instrument to keep tech- nology in check. But the wise use of science cannot itself be grounded in science. Rather it must be grounded in the philosophical conviction that life is so precious that we must pass it on - not because of an abstract</page><page sequence="14">60 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE sense of duty or a universal moral law, but because of an impassio- ned commitment to life itself.
