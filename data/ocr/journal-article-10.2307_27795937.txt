<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS GRACE, VIOLENCE, DIGNITY The Mortal No: Death and the Modern Imagination. By Fred erick J. Hoffman, xvi -f 507 pp. Princeton University Press. $8.50. Rilke's novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, published in 1910, served as example and paradigm for much that is dis tinctive and uniquely valuable in modern fiction; as such, it is partly responsible for much that is distinctive and for the time being uniquely valuable in our contemporary ways of facing life and death. For the reading of fiction is not merely a pastime; to many thoughtful men and women, a novelist stands in the rela tion of priest, psychoanalyst, philosopher or prophet: he expresses in the relationships of his characters an attitude toward the con temporary forms of permanent problems. One of Malte's state ments about an old uncle, Count Christian Brahe, expresses quite clearly the modern loss of certitude and faith: My uncle's life, of which only rumors ever penetrated to the public and even to the family, rumors that he never took the trouble to contradict, offered boundless opportunities for in terpretation. Urnekloster [the family estate] is now in his possession. But no one knows whether he is living there. Perhaps he is still traveling, as his habit was; perhaps the news of his death is on its way from some remotest part of the earth, written by his foreign servant in bad English [Count Christian was a Dane] or in some unknown tongue. Or perhaps the servant will give no sign when one day he is left alone. Perhaps they have both disappeared long ago, remaining only on the passenger list of some missing ship under names that were not their own. The name Urnekloster means urn-cloister or urn-enclosure ? perhaps a mausoleum; and though the name Brahe inevitably suggests Tycho Brahe, one of the boldest of all intellectual ad 250</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS venturers, the Count seems less a seeker than one who is sought: how like he is to the silent Klamm in Kafka's The Castle, or the unknown judges in The Trial, or the elusive Marquis de Rollebon in Sartre's Nausea ( a novel clearly derived from Rilke's ), or Beck ett's Godot, or the man to whom the package should be delivered in Robbe-Grillet's labyrinth. And how like are all these to Death ? to whom it is indifferent whether we approach him with the logic of a chess player or the intuition of a juggler, gently or raging, patiently or eagerly or fearfully or bored, with or with out a package. Him? It. A generation ago John Crowe Ransom and E. E. Cum mings could still personify death, and Robert Pinget did so in 1956; but contemporary writers generally avoid that kind of poetry or metaphysics. Not only do we no longer think of God in anthropomorphic terms; we are ceasing even to think of our selves in anthropomorphic terms. Death is no longer a person who comes for us personally, as if we were persons. Nor is it any longer a door into a non-human but somehow anthropomor phic world beyond life, or even, as Heidegger said, the final chord whose resolution gives meaning to the melody of life ? a pretty metaphor adapted from Saint Augustine's De Musica by a philosopher who approved of Nazism when it was in and disap proved of it when it was out, thus guaranteeing the moral and intellectual chic of anything he may say ? the Modesein of the Dasein, as it were. Not that he is insincere; he believes with patent sincerity whatever it pays to believe at the moment; and his pleasant dressing-up of death now has a mad vogue among the Bonwit Tellers and the Lords and Taylors of philosophy. Nothing so sets atwitter the academies of fashion as a pretty corpse vaguely glimpsed through tangled syntax. But serious writers are not concerned with such things. They are concerned with the hard fact that death in the modern world, like life in the modern world, has no meaning clearly sanctioned either by nature or by history. Our lives are absurd, and our deaths are absurd. This is the fact we must learn to live with. The fall of a man is not noted, either in Heaven or on earth. There is not even 251</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF GENERAL EDUCATION indifference, but only blank nothingness. In the modern world we have not only killed God, we have also killed history: our death, we now believe, will mean nothing to the future, just as it means nothing to the present. This is the problem serious modern writers deal with. Professor Hoffman's book is an anal ysis of the various ways in which they deal with it. It is a difficult book; I believe it is a great book; I believe it will have a permanent place of honor among the books that afford us the deepest insights into our deepest problems. Professor Hoffman, who has long been known as a literary scholar, must now be reckoned with as a philosopher. He divides his study of contemporary literature into three parts, dealing with the metaphors of grace, the metaphors of violence, and the metaphors of self. The metaphors of grace deal with the problem of retaining some personal initiative with re gard to one's own death: the problem of deciding in what way or under what circumstances or for what cause or with what atti tude, maintaining what values, one will die; such metaphors as sume that values are real, and therefore that one's death need not be purposeless, meaningless, absurd. The metaphors of violence deal with the destruction of such possibilities by the violent force with which arbitrariness imposes itself in the modern world; and the metaphors of self deal with the various ways in which con temporary writers have conceived of selfhood ? that is to say, of meaning ? persisting under such circumstances. Professor Hoffman finds most validity in a view of the self whose history he traces from William James through Sartre: the view that our nature is not fixed but is subject to our own chosen and willed determinations. According to this view, I can be whatever I choose to be ? only I must choose in action, not in wishfulness. If I have been a coward all my life, that is because I have chosen, from moment to moment, from day to day, from year to year, to act in cowardly ways; I can become brave at any time I choose, by acting bravely; what is necessary is a willed decision; I am absolutely free to decide, but the only real de cision is the one I act on. No action, no decision ? or rather a decision to remain a coward. This variety of existentialism, which 252</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS serious contemporary writers are increasingly drawn to, Professor Hoffman finds a valid source of values by which we can live. I have grossly oversimplified his conclusions by presenting them without the mass of evidence and the careful reasoning on which they are based; those who have read his Freudianism and the Literary Mind and The Modern Novel in America will have some idea of the difficulty of encompassing in a brief review such richness, such magnitude, density, and weight.
