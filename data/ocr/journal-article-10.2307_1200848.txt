<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM ERLAND EHNMARK* D URING the last few years the question about an interpreta- tion of the general history of religion from a Christian point of view has aroused increasing interest among theologians. It is sufficient to name here only two works concerned with this matter: Types of Religious Experience by Joachim Wach (1951) and The Christian Interpretation of Religion by E. J. Jurji (1952). Both refer to the views of Nathan Siderblom. Without any criticism of their treatment of SSderblom, it must, however, be said that there is more in Soderblom than can be found by readers who do not master Swedish. It is therefore not out of place to describe Siderblom's thought somewhat more completely. In this arti- cle page references to works not avail- able in English are omitted. Full ref- erences are given in my Religionsprob- lemet hos Nathan Siiderblom (Lund, 1949; in Swedish only). The Nature of Revelation by Nathan S6derblom was translated into English by Frederic E. Pamp and published by Oxford Uni- versity Press in 1933. This translation is used in quotations in the present article. Nathan SSderblom believed in a gen- eral revelation. He believed in it. It was never more to him than a matter of faith, nor was it anything less. He thought that a Christian was in his full right so to believe. Even in a small book of instruction for confirmation classes he speaks of this matter: "God has, according to the Bible, revealed himself to man in many ways, in a gen- eral revelation to all men and in a special revelation to Israel and to Christendom." Thus to him the idea of a common revelation also belongs to that which matters religiously. It is, in fact, an integrating part of his theology. When SSderblom first took up the problem, he did it in a particular his- torical situation, which explains much of the form he gave to his thoughts. In a Festschrift dedicated to Dean C. A. Thoren, the essay The Nature of Reve- lation, which later became a classic in Swedish theology, was published for the first time (1903). The Babel-Bible dis- cussion was then going on. The As- syriologist, Friedrich Delitzsch, had in some addresses, which aroused much interest, shown that there exist marked similarities between Babylonian and biblical religion, the narrative of the great flood and other things. The re- action, both in theology and in the church, was violent. This explains the outline of some parts of S*derblom's book, which will surely puzzle a pres- ent-day reader. The Introduction-- omitted in the English translation-is worth quoting: * Erland Ehnmark is professor of comparative religion and dean of the faculty at Lund Univer- sity in Sweden. He has been a lecturer in com- parative religion at Uppsala University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1935. He has written and published The Idea of God in Homer, Anthropo- morphism and Miracle, Religionsproblemet hos Nathan S'derblom, Linnaeus and the Problem of Immortality, and has written articles for the Har- vard Theological Review and Eranos. 218</page><page sequence="2">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM 219 The contribution of the historical cuneiform writings to the confirmation or the correction of Old Testament history is an important and remarkable fact to the spiritual heir of Israel, the church. Through the sensational action of Professor Friedrich Delitzsch the thing became known to the public outside the modem free- masonry of scholars. This would in no way have created the anxiety and confusion to which a good deal of the Babel-Bible literature in Germany and elsewhere bears testimony, if unevangelical theories, abandoned by theologi- cal science, about literal inerrancy and unhis- torical and mechanical concepts of revelation had not been allowed to keep away from the church insights which cannot be refuted and which, as a matter of fact, are not apt to weaken or disturb the Christian faith. Against faith which is bound to the letter and against an unhistorical and mechanical conception of revelation, S6derblom wishes to set forth another conception which is usable historically and at the same time serves a theolog- ical purpose as an expression of the Christian faith in revelation. It is the latter point of view, revelation as the object of belief, which first comes into question when general and special rev- elation are discussed. What is revela- tion? "The word 'revelation' is used in this connection in a special sense. A rev- elation of God is present wherever a real religion is found. Where God is known, it may be even imperfectly and through a distorting medium, there he has in some degree allowed himself to become known, yes, made himself known" (p. 6). Revelation is divine self-disclosure. This implies that we have to do with a religious interpretation of the history of religion, not with something that can be historically proved. Christianity considers itself founded on revelation. But how does it regard other religions? Is it the sole bearer of religious truth and revelation? To Siderblom there was really no choice: in all real religion there is a revelation. "For Christian theology, the history of religion is at the same time a divine self-disclosure. The general science of religion leaves the question of revelation open" (p. 200). The reason is this: The two other interpretations generally of- fered, to explain the fact of the existence of religious faith and truth outside the Biblical revelation, break down completely. Are all cases of piety and virtue outside the Christian revelation simply a work of the devil, a carica- ture perpetrated by demons, as we may read in Augustine? How then can they be true, and in important respects exactly like those of the Christian faith? ... Or, if the truth about God, which is found in the religions apart from those of the Bible, be the product of man's own reason, as has been taught all the way from the Apologists of the early church down to the various theories of "natural religion," where shall we draw the line between the di- vine and the human in the religions of the Bible? ... Could the same faith in divine providence, the same religious seriousness and pious practical wisdom in Socrates, or Seneca, or Epictetus be in them a devilish deception or a self-discovered wisdom, but be a work of God in the Psalmist or in Paul or Tertullian? Nay, belief in a general revelation of God is forced upon us, so soon as we make a serious acquaintance with non-Christian religion, even where this shows itself debased, degraded or "ignorant" (Eph. 4: 18), and however loudly it may call for the gospel of the Cross. Ulti- mately all certainty of God and divine matters has its source in an intuitive sense of God [pp. 7 ff.]. That all religion depends on a rev- elation is, SSderblom says, "an ancient Christian idea" (p. 8). He quotes in this connection the words of Paul in Acts that God has not "left himself without witness." "Even pagans have known that 'we are also his offspring.' They have been 'feeling after Him' " (p. 10). But if the idea of a general</page><page sequence="3">220 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION revelation has support in the Bible and in Christian tradition, it has become obscured "partly because of the exclu- sively theological point of view which has characterized different lines of thought in the past century, and partly because of our lack of acquaintance with the literature and spiritual treas- ures of the ancient world." If the fresh, immediate, and uplifting feeling with which Socrates and Seneca met "the same God, our God," were still alive, there would have been sympathy even in ecclesiastical circles with the prayer of Nebuchadnezzar to Marduk or with the plaintive cry to Ishtar (pp. 8 ff.). This teaching should, according to Si6derblom, be accepted more generally in the church as a reaction against "that narrow view which has gone with the over-valuation of the truth-content of the Biblical revelation, such as has been prevalent during the past century. ... It is high time in this age of world mis- sions and world communications and the final flow of world history in one deep stream, that the Church acquaint itself with the thought of the general revelation of God" (pp. 10ff.). This was written in 1903, but Siderblom re- edited his essay in 1930, with only a few alterations. Sbderblom's view on general revela- tion is intimately connected with his conception of the religious meaning of miracle. Revelation as a divine self-dis- closure is a miracle. In the last resort we meet with the question of knowl- edge and 'belief. To Sbderblom, the re- lation between these two is clear and unequivocal. Knowledge, i.e., science, has for its task to bring observed facts into a series of causes and effects-in other words, in a connection of space and time. Science does not reach fur- ther, nor is it satisfied with less. The reason why science with its methods does not find God is therefore not that God does not exist or does not work, but it lies in the fact that God, who himself leads and governs everything, never appears as a secondary cause, i.e., as a cause perceptible to the senses. The religious wonder does not consist in an external miracle, a break in the chain of causes, but is rather an interpreta- tion of the natural connection as caused by God; it consists in the experience of divine guidance and in the belief in a meaning and a goal for that which happens. The natural explanation of an event is not at all incompatible with a religious interpretation of the same event as a wonder, that is, as effected by a will active in natural phenomena, a divine interference. Here is not a fight between natural science and Christianity, but two different ways of see- ing. The one sees what is before the eyes, the other perceives the inner, hidden meaning of the happenings. The one looks back, the other forward. The one asks for causa, the cause, and adds new links to the external chain of causes visible to all. The other asks for telos, the purpose, God's intent, which appears to the eyes of faith only, and thus adds links to the invisible chain which draws the soul upward and forward, in binding it to God. Miracle is not what we. cannot under- stand but that which faith really under- stands. And herein lies a revelation. The sphere of wonder increases in the same measure as a man learns to know God through communion with him. Do you see the miracle not as emptiness or as something negative, that which cannot be explained, or perhaps will gradually be explained, but as something positive, a divine interference, an act of God? Growth in faith means seeing more of God's acts, and this is to see more miracles. For religion, miracle thus means an interpretation of experience. In the</page><page sequence="4">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM 221 same way belief in revelation means an interpretation. Is God active in one reli- gion only? Is only one religion true, and are all other religions false? The contention that only one religion is true, i.e., contains divine revelation, is in principle based upon the same argu- ment as the one that wonder is an ex- ternal miracle, a break in the actual chain of causes. In both cases it is sup- posed that the activity of God can be discerned through external characteris- tics. In the one case it is thought pos- sible to see his interference in gaps found in an otherwise continuous chain of natural events; in the other, revela- tion is delimited by inclosing it between the covers of a book or by the suppo- sition that God works only inside a cer- tain community. Defining Christianity as the only true religion is evidently not enough-Judaism at least must hold some form of religious truth, though it be not the perfect truth. And he who refutes the general revelation altogether does not escape from the problem un- less, e.g., he considers Protestantism or, to take the full consequences, a certain kind of Protestantism as the only true religion in distinction from every other faith. That the standpoint of SOiderblom also leads to difficulties can be only indicated here. It is the same with revelation as with miracle: everything can be conceived as a miracle, but everything is not so considered, at least not to the same de- gree. Likewise, in all religion there is revelation, but everything in religion is not revelation. This is the reason why S6derblom very emphatically main- tains that no border lines can be drawn around revelation. Wherein the element of revelation in any particular form of religion consists, is difficult to say; it becomes impossible if one attempts to apply an intellectualistic view. But the fact that there is a measure of revelation, that is, of a divine self-disclosure, wherever there is found a sincere religiousness, is expressed by faith in a revelation, which is held both within and without the Christian religion [p. 204]. Neither can we in the prophetic religion draw a line around certain words or certain events and say, here is God and revelation, there is man and Nature. Even in the perfect revelation of God in the person of Christ the divine and the human are commingled, as the theologians have expressed it in the doctrine of the communicatio idiomatum [p. 34]. It is in his essay The Nature of Rev- elation that St*derblom made the well- known distinction between the two kinds of mysticism-the mysticism of infinity and the mysticism of personal- ity (p. 74). The difference between them, which he considered as the most important watershed in the history of religion, will show itself in the concep- tion of God as well as in the relation to God. In this essay, however, SOider- blom deals chiefly with the conception of God. He was to come back to the relation to God in his Gifford Lectures (see The Living God). As for the con- ception of God, the two views are thus described: Is God the great, silent sea of infinity, which yearns to have the individual broken frag- ments float together again, formless and name- less, to slumber in its mysterious embrace? Or is God the overmastering, enkindling and burn- ing holy love, which wills and generates per- sonal life? [p. 76.]. The difference lies in the role which the per- sonal life plays. The question is, must the per- sonal life be repressed or extinguished in order to gain the end of religion or attain its higher stages? Or shall it be recreated and purified, so that the natural ego is surrendered and the eternal loving union with God, the "image of God" of theology, the "soul spark" (Fiinke- lein) of the German mysticism of the Middle Ages, is realized and grows into a new man, the man of God, the concentrated and active life of love in an ethical personality? [p. 74].</page><page sequence="5">222 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Is God personal or impersonal? Siderblom expressly states that he is here approaching the matter from a historical point of view (pp. 59 ff.). The difference between the two kinds of mysticism is founded on facts, and he has not with any apologetic aim maintained that mysticism of personal- ity is limited to Christianity. With this distinction, no boundary is drawn be- tween "true" and "false" religion. Nor does mysticism of personality in fact coincide with Christianity as a histori- cal phenomenon. Socrates is reckoned as belonging to the mysticism of per- sonality, and mysticism of infinity is found also inside historic Christianity. On the other hand, a religious inter- pretation of the history of religion can be based upon this distinction, because, in the opinion of Sdiderblom, nature- and culture-religion culminate in the mysticism of infinity. It is worth while noticing that when he wants to defend the uniqueness of Christianity, he takes for comparison the very best and high- est which the other view can offer. The alp-tops are compared, not the heights of Christianity, with the common land of other religions. The problem is to determine the dis- tinction of the Christian religion in re- lation to other religions in a manner which is not detrimental to a correct and generous understanding of them. The problem is also to give reasons for the claim of Christianity to be the per- fect religion, while at the same time satisfying the religious idea of a gen- eral revelation. If there is truth in every religion, wherein lies the special value of Christian truth? S6derblom says: "I am almost as certain that we reach in Bach, in prin- ciple, the highest point in music, and that Plotinus constitutes the perfection of the mysticism of infinity, as I am that Christ will never be surpassed nor even equalled in the history of Divine revelation. Of course this can have no demonstration logically" (p. 124; my italics). Thus it is a question of evalu- ation, even if certain reasons can be given in support, even if it is possible to investigate situations where the yearning for infinity and where the urge to the ideal have actually asserted themselves most fully in the world of religion. Nowhere except in Christiani- ty have the ideals been so exalted, has the ethical demand been so sharpened to the highest degree. If the yearning for infinity be preferred, it will be found in its purest form in, for example, Plotinus; but "if we value more the passion to attain the ideal . . . then there is no doubt that in the life of Christ and in the history in which that life is set, we have the revelation of God par priference within humanity, enduring and not to be surpassed" (p. 131). But what happens to the truth of religion, if we are allowed to make our choice? It must first be said that the difference between the two kinds of mysticism and between general and spe- cial revelation is to some extent a dif- ference in kind rather than a difference in degree. The choice in question does not concern something so elementary as that between higher and lower or be- tween error and truth. On higher levels in the history of religion the religious reaction finds clearer and more distinct expressions. "Then we may notice that now the one, now the other attribute of the object of faith becomes predominant and, in consequence of the limitations of human faculties, threatens to dis-</page><page sequence="6">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM 223 place its complement" (pp. 111 ff.). S6derblom always regards religion as a personal matter. The choice concerns a way "to shape one's inner and outer life in a consistent and consequential manner." Personal and traditional fac- tors will play their part, and no one's knowledge is more than partial. The higher religions represent to a certain extent a one-sided conception of the one divine reality. But Sider- blom holds that the proper religion of revelation has a richer knowledge of God. Its God is not the unknown or hidden God but, in a real sense, the re- vealed God. The religion of revelation, that is, the revelation founded on Christ, knows more of God. If revela- tion means the appearance in history of positive religious contents-and so Sbderblom once defines revelation- then the religion of revelation has more positive contents than other forms of religion, from the point of view of qual- ity. The special revelation contains more than the general revelation, not necessarily more doctrines, but some- thing which the general revelation lacks and never can acquire. The deity of the mysticism of infinity is, after all, more the unknown than the known God. Even if the secret essence of God is un- knowable also to the mysticism of per- sonality-and few have had such a sense of that as Siderblom-this faith knows as much as can be expressed with words such as "saving will," "mercy," and "love." Over against the negative attributes of mysticism or, rather, complementing them, positive qualities are set forth. With its more intimate knowledge of who God is, the religion of revelation rests on a special revelation. The experience of God de- veloped on the religious line of the Bible has thus a "stronger and more forward character of revelation" (p. 109). Siderblom thought in concrete terms. And religion was to him, first of all, an experienced reality. This made him un- derstand that other people's religion, too, could be the expression of a real experience. This same concrete and em- pirical approach he applies when deal- ing with the question of religious truth. There is a God. What do we know of him? Who knows something about him? Here we are not discussing the philo- sophical question of whether God exists, a question which S6derblom debates in other connections, but we are asking what religious faith really contains. How are we to find a place for religious experience within the concepts of world and of life, which nobody can help forming, more or less clearly, more or less consciously. Religion can never be proved to those who have no experience of it, but it is necessary that it be ex- pressed or at least indicated without prejudicing intellectual honesty, for it can never be reduced to logical con- cepts. What is truth? S6derblom uses the words "truth" and "reality" very often; they belong in an unwonted de- gree to his fixed vocabulary in religious contexts. In the book which perhaps gives most of S6derblom himself in its wholly unique mixture of historical out- looks, exegetical analyses, and deeply personal confessions-"The Passion of Christ" (Kristi pinas historia)-he is somewhat ironical over the fussy inter- pretations of Pilate's question. We do not know what Pilate meant, or if he meant anything at all. "The word 'truth' had occurred several times in Christ's explanation, a great word. The great word altogether in thought and</page><page sequence="7">224 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION life. Pilate takes it up but leaves the question for what it is worth. What is truth? There are many opinions about it." In S6derblom there are two opinions, distinctly separated. He has just quoted the words of Jesus that he is the king of truth and has come into the world to witness for truth. If Jesus had only stopped at these words! But he was not used to saying something in general only. Jesus never stated facts just for their own sake but for the sake of the people who heard him. Truth did not mean to him a statement or several statements capable of gen- eral application, and which at any time can and ought to be repeated, but truth was to him what a human soul in a given moment was in need of hearing for its consolation, or humilia- tion, or guidance. This is the religious truth to be distin- guished from general truth, that is, dis- tinguished from the truth of science. The assurance that God exists can be acquired only by personal experi- ence. "Conviction about God," we read in S6derblom's episcopal letter, "must build on an overwhelming personal experience of his reality, not on an ac- cumulation of facts accessible to all. Nor did doubts such as we meet with in Job and in the Seventy-third Psalm end in a theoretical solution but in an inde- pendent assuredness of the nearness and indispensability of God." Thus the criterion lies in the religious experi- ence. Consequently, there can be no general criterion of religious truth other than the religious attitude as such. In that sense religious knowledge is un- avoidably subjective. Real piety is al- ways "in its essence a secret of the soul, a revelation." It does not mean that every man has a religion entirely to himself. But piety is nevertheless, as distinguished from a conceptual convic- tion, the property of the individual. "There must be a personal revelation without its necessarily leading to a crisis-there must be a 'seeing' [cf. The Living God, p. 59] or a decision for life." If we keep in mind that revelation, the religious truth, cannot be rigidly de- limited or theoretically determined, cannot be expressed in some general sentences or reduced to the contents of a book, then it must be said that S6der- blom has taken up a logically entirely consistent position when he makes the very sincerity of piety the criterion of religious truth. "If we mean by revela- tion God's manifestation, the transpar- ency of the higher or true reality in obscure or lucid forms, we must grant, to a higher or lesser degree, a character of revelation to every religion where elements of religious truths are appar- ent. And wherein lies the truth of reli- gion, if not in the sincerity of a heart in need of help? 'Thou wouldst not be seeking me, if thou hadst not already found me.' " The quotation from the sufi Rumi shows that we are not con- cerned only with Christian religion. "Where piety shows true sincerity and ardor, there is something found of God's revelation." S6derblom is of the opinion that some people have really met God. They have seen as much of the divine world, of the divine reality, as they have been able to receive. The capacity to see and to find is dependent on the sincerity and seriousness of the seeker. "To have a vision of God re- quires a pure heart and a clear and true personality, not knowledge, not an art or a method. To know him there is needed the heart of a child, not philos- ophy" (p. 82). But, "if we are strictly conscientious and exacting we must ad-</page><page sequence="8">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM 225 mit that we are not able to perceive much of the revelation of God. In every case, this is our fault, not God's. Still, we know that we have met him in our life, we are conscious as we look back upon life, of his guidance" (p. 137). Revelation will always require a medium; it passes through the canal of spiritual life into humanity. The purity of the revelation depends on the qual- ity of the personality which receives it, at first hand but also at second hand. S6derblom's view is really as simple and as consistent as that. We meet it as early as in his inauguration lecture: "Already in the longing for the divine, which is perceptible everywhere, you will recognize the afterglow of a heav- enly light. If it is weaker here, shining more clearly there, it is due not to the insufficiency of the source of light but to the position and the receptivity of the receiver." Here the possibility is at hand of allowing religious truth different forms without declaring it less true on that score. It must always, in a sense, be personal. The mysticism of infinity and personal mysticism have different con- ceptions of God. Seemingly the ques- tion is open: Which conception is true? Is God personal or impersonal? No- body who has the least acquaintance with Sdiderblom's writings will believe that he would hesitate in answering the question-but, nevertheless, it is not the whole answer. Once he speaks of the "approximative or symbolic charac- ter of our understanding of what revela- tion is" and continues: But we must give over the habit of reason- ing about the mystery of reality and of God, as though it were like the question of an equa- tion, or of the politics of the Kaiser, or of the canals of Mars. How insipid and pretentious some ways of treating the greatest of all prob- lems must appear to any one who has had a vital appreciation of the rich and mysterious, the imposing and unfathomable complexity into which we enter as but infinitesimal ele- ments. Examples of clear and firm attitudes toward life, of unswerving convictions, such that a man could die for them, assuredly do not involve also the ability adequately to ex- express them. How have not prophets and apostles felt that! [Pp. 106 ff.] The question cannot simply be put in just this way: Is the fundamental power of existence something infinite, or is it a personal will?-even if S6der- blom apparently sometimes poses this very question. "Great men are always right, even when they contradict each other," a sentence often quoted by him, is not only a paradox. Rather, the para- dox contains, as frequently happens, a truth. "The heroes of the religion of in- finity have won an eternally abiding home for thousands and thousands of noble and devoted souls. No one can read their writings without feeling that this infinite world, so distant from our outward world, possesses a reality, a power, a fascination" (pp. 118 ff.). In the second edition of The Nature of Revelation he added a paragraph, wherein he expressed his conviction that "visions, contemplation, do convey to mystically gifted men and women a real perception of the being of God" (p. 120). Probably he was always thinking along these lines. He said once that it was due to the exclusiveness which sometimes characterizes religious gen- ius that Luther was not able to consider the mystic religion as "another basic type with legitimate claims in its spe- cies, possessed of beauty and truth and feeling" (p. 89). This was, accordingly, a defect in Luther. In the second series of his Gifford Lectures, Siiderblom wanted to take up</page><page sequence="9">226 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION these questions. This series was never delivered because of the death of the archbishop, but parts of it were pre- pared, and the leading thoughts can be reconstructed from his notes. On the wrapper containing notes to the eleventh lecture, the first in the second series, SOiderblom has written as a capi- tal title, "Was Christ a Mystic?" Above this appears, also in S6derblom's own hand: "Evelyn Underhill." Inside the folder is found, among other things, a typewritten manuscript containing a detailed criticism of Underhill's book Mysticism, together with an offprint of S6derblom's essay The Hidden Father. These two papers summarize, I think, S6derblom's views on the truth of mys- ticism and its relation to the religion of the Gospels. Mysticism, it is said, has a point of contact in every human being and can to some extent be experienced by every- one. "Like the authoress I am also con- vinced that these men and women have succeeded in penetrating the veil or, to speak more correctly, that God has for them, at least at times, pushed back the curtain so as to give them an apprehen- sion of the eternal, everlasting world." SOiderblom will not, he says, in any way refute the thesis and conviction of mys- ticism. "When the mystics return from their journeys to heaven and describe the other country, their narratives are, after all, unanimous to an extent that we must draw the same conclusion as we do in the case of explorers on this our planet. How explain the uniform- ity? The simplest answer is, 'They speak the truth. They relate what they have seen and experienced.' " However, mysticism does not possess the whole truth. Mysticism is not in complete accord with Christianity, properly speaking. Neither the stages nor the whole theory of mysticism finds any support in the New Testament. Further, there are two ways of perceiv- ing the Ultimate Being, a static and a dynamic way. Mysticism has no place for history, for the conception of the innermost reality as an eternal purpose, a creative evolution, a divine action in history. If the work and experiences of the prophets and the Son are taken as a point of departure, it is not possible to arrive at an exposition of religion like the one which here [in mysticism] attracts and enlightens us. Hence revelation in the Scriptures and the continued revelation form a necessary corrective, a complement, to prevent the delusion that God's secret being is a neutral entity always at rest. God manifests himself as active, as the Lord of history, as the heavenly Father of Jesus Christ. But, on the other hand, mysticism is of importance to the religion of personal- ity. Neither of these views [the static and the dynamic] can claim to present the true es- sence of God adequately and exactly. They are both of consequence as correctives. The con- ception of the eternally resting, unchanging be- ing, in whose quietness, never disturbed by any ripple, the soul takes refuge from the storms and gusts of life, will easily lead to a concept of something dead, lifeless, and thus vigorless, empty, inactive. This view will have to be cor- rected and counterbalanced by the conception of eternal activity and the power which never rests. This view, in its turn, may easily make the Divine too human, too much entangled in the vicissitudes of time. It needs, for its part, to be corrected and complemented with the idea of God's eternal tranquillity. No such teaching is complete. The vitalistic, dynamic view balances the idea of a neutral, lifeless be- ing. The static view corrects the idea of some- thing like effort in the eternal being. Here we meet a point which is more stressed by Siderblom than often is the case. SBderblom is an irreconcilable</page><page sequence="10">GENERAL REVELATION ACCORDING TO NATHAN SODERBLOM 227 enemy of everything that has the ap- pearance of anthropomorphism in the image of God. One reason why he valued the mysticism of infinity was that he had to acknowledge that it was right in treating the Divine as some- thing totaliter and in se incapable of being expressed in conceptual terms. We cannot by any means form an ade- quate conception of God. It is the mis- take of both intellectualism and moral- ism that they believe they can. And orthodoxy, to which pure doctrine means everything, comes under the same judgment. God is the Father which is in secret, the Inner Guest;' and the Inner Guest, whom deep and searching minds inside and outside Christianity have found and moved with, is the Father in the concealment of the gospel. The Gospels speak of him as the concealed God, revealed in Christ. Here is the explanation both of Sbderblom's definitely Christocentric attitude and of his readiness to recog- nize religious truth even outside Chris- tianity. The general revelation is to him the expression of an eminently Christian idea: the image of God found in the Gospels does not exclude, but makes perfect, the religious experience of the mysticism of infinity. To take a different view is, in the last resort, to plead the cause of anthropomorphism. The Gospels do not know any vision of God or any conception or form or in- tellectual image of the Heavenly Father, the Lord of heaven and earth. Jesus is in this respect poorer than any of the religious heroes who have lived in com- munion with the living God. The Mosaic pro- hibition of images in the New Testament is replaced by the declaration of Jesus: "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." God can be concretely conceived only in the form of the Son. This is the same as saying that Christi- anity is nothing but communion with God through Christ, as Siderblom, in fact, once defined Christianity. The paradox in Christianity is that "re- vealed religion has reached its perfec- tion, not in a perfect doctrine or guide to salvation, but in a person."2 "Jesus, the fulfiller of Moses and the prophets, did not come to establish a new reli- gion, but rather to do away with all reli- gions and establish the Kingdom of God. A religion with all the characteris- tics of such has risen out of his legacy. But this is only a transition, a means toward the end, the Kingdom of God. It is not yet made manifest what we shall be" (ibid., p. 30). But if this be so, there is room for religious truth even outside Christian- ity. When Christ came, "he had the power of making man's whole searching for God an antecedent of himself." Men have been seeking God also else- where and in other ways and have real- ly found him. It is possible to discern one and the same thing from separate points, even if it is best and most truly apprehended from one special point only. The Father in secret is both the known and the unknown God. His revelation in Christ does not in all re- spects contend against, but also com- plements, what others have found. Thus we may perhaps understand what Siderblom meant when he said that the sacred books of India, China, and Ja- pan might become as many Old Testa- ments to the one New Testament. This is really not syncretism. There is no question of religious confusion. But it is concrete thinking. What about Sun- dar Singh? What happens when a fol- lower of another religion becomes Christian? In what way has Christian-</page><page sequence="11">228 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ity been spread among the nations? Every translation is an interpretation, as is best known by missionaries. Chris- tianity will always appear dressed in the clothes of national traditions, e.g., the "Hellenic-Roman-Teutonic" tradi- tion. And it is by no means certain that exactly this raiment is the one which most smoothly follows the real form. Nor can we be sure that it will be the most appropriate in countries with a different spiritual climate. Christ was an oriental himself. The form of Christianity which, according to God's plan, made the detour through the West in order to benefit India is too much marked by Greek and Roman spirit and by the divisions and formulas of a long and arduous history to be the final word of our Savior to India. Sundar Singh's mysticism of Christ is home-bred. He has not altered, much less corrupted, the gos- pel with Indian ingredients. But he does not carry on his shoulders the heavy armor of Western church orders and dogmatic tradition, or of its embarrassing demands of comfort. The Sadhu did not lack tradition, but his was different from ours. Even he who comes from the mysti- cism of infinity can have something to give. Infinity and will are human con- ceptions, not very clear, not very exact. The same is true of the concept of per- sonality. The divine will is not opposite to infinity in such a way as to be finite. The via negationis of mysticism con- tains the true insight that human words are too poor to express the divine. Si*derblom once said: "The good news of Christ is a message of Divine author- ity, of infinite seriousness and love" (p. 125). The Infinite and Unfathom- able which we call God is a holy and forgiving will of love. And was not S6derblom right, after all? The contrast between the concept of God of the mysticism of infinity and that of the mysticism of personality is perhaps not greater than the tension between the two qualities inherent in the image of God as taught in the Gos- pels, i.e., holiness or righteousness and mercy. Pascal once wrote: "The right- eousness of God must be as enormous as his mercy. But the righteousness to- ward the reprobates is less enormous and ought to shock less than his mercy to the chosen."
