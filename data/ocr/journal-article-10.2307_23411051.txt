<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Vanuatu, Océanie, arts des îles de cendre et de corail" An exhibition at the Musée National des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie, Paris, 2 October 1997—2 February 1998. The Honorable Serge Vohor Prime Minister of Vanuatu officially opened the exhibition after being introduced by Madame Françoise Cachin, Director of the Museums of France, and Monsieur Jean Hubert Martin, Director of the Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie. Reviewed by Christian Coiffier Musée de l'Homme, Paris The exhibition "Vanuatu, Océanie, arts des îles de cendre et de corail" was inaugurated at Port Vila, Vanuatu and ran from 28 June to 18 August 1996. The ni-Vanuatu organizers have titled this exhibi tion, in Bislama, "Spirit blong bubu i kam bak, " meaning "the spirit of the ancestors returns." This title illustrates completely the profound sense that these diverse masterpieces have to convey in their emotional appearance at the temporary return of the objects to their place of creation after more than 50 years of exile. The exhibition then was moved to Noumea, New Caledonia, from 3 September to 30 October, then to Basel, Switzerland, from 15 March to 10 August 1997. Organized by the Réunion des Musées Nationaux, the Musée National des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie, Paris, the Museum der Kulturen, Basel, with the support of the Musée Territorial de Noumea de Nouvelle Calédonie and the Centre cul turel de Port-Vila, it has benefitted as well from the help of the Musée de l'Homme. The international collaboration that has allowed this exhibition to be realized shows clearly that a spirit of exchange and cooperation can be evinced between the country of origin of the objects and the Western museums that have conserved them since their collection at the beginning of the century. While the majority of the objects have been shown in the four places where the exhibitions were, a small number, have only been shown locally because they were too fragile to be transported great distances. The plastic arts only are represented, but certain objects, such as masks and flutes, suggest the performing arts, with dance and music. On 30 October 1997, a small group of friends and colleagues of Joël Bonnemaison, recently deceased, met to evoke his memory and the role he played in the realization of this exhibition. They gathered together, several moments before the official open ing, around his widow and son for a moving cere mony which ends, according to Vanuatu custom, in the distribution of a cup of kava to each participant. The exhibition brings together 400 traditional objects that represent a wide range of the produc tion of the craftsmen and artists of the different archipelagos that constitute the state of Vanuatu. It allows one to admire the finest examples of varied forms: sculpture in wood, rernroot, and stone, pot tery, jewelry of pearl shell, shells, and pigs' teeth, feather ornaments, tapa beaters, clay overmodeling, and a sort of felt utilizing cobwebs — a technique unique to this part of the world. These objects, up to the present, were dispersed in different collec tions: the Musée d'Aquitaine de Bordeaux, the Musée des Beaus-Arts de Chartres, the Musée de l'Homme, the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle et d'Ethnograhie de la Rochelle, the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle et d'Ethnographie de Lille, the Musée National dArt Moderne, the Musée National des Art d'Afrique et d'Oceanie, and the Musée Picasso, for France; The British Museum, the Museum of Mankind, London, the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Cambridge, for Great Britain; the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, Leiaen, tor tne iNetnerianas; tne Museum rur Volkerdunde, Leipzig, and the Linden Museum, otuttgart tor the rederal Republic or Germany; the Museum der Kulturen de Bale (Felix Speiser collec tionj and the Musee d hthnographie de Geneve, ror Switzerland. The scenography was carried out by Philippe Délis assisted by Thibaud Simonin. The presenta tion of the exhibits is spread over an area 600 square meters divided into four unequal spaces. The con ception of the exhibition articulates between two poles linked by a large gallery leading from the sub dued light of a men's house, with its secrets reserved to its initiates alone, towards the light of the dance place with its slit drums and its large sculptures of the different grades. Its space has been laid out between the entrance and the exit to show the com mercial trades that are evoked by a series of canoe prows and various forms of stone money. Maps show the different archipelagos and the principal exchange networks, but there is no map of the 16 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="2">Pacific to enable visitors to place Vanuatu in its geo graphical context in the region.The false cloth ceil ing is sufficiently low in the large gallery to create a secret atmosphere, which recalls that of the men's houses of Vanuatu. The majority of the objects are exhibited in cases ,but some sculptures of fern and of wood (drums, posts spears, and very large funer ary effigies) are not. This allows the viewers to appre ciate fully the quality of the materials without obstructing their view of the object. The pedestals are, in the great majority of cases, well adapted — but one must, however, criticize the aesthetic of the system of cables employed to support the pillar sur mounted by a bird in the left rotunda. The labels are sparing and inobtrusive; they provide the necessary and essential information. The lighting enhances the best features of the objects while at the same time creatine on the walls the most aesthetic shadows. However, it is regrettable that the lights of the cases are also so placed that they disturb the view from further away. On entering, the visitor can make for the dark ness to the right or the light to the left. Facing him, he comes upon several monumental works, sculp ture in root and treefern, plaques of painted wood, which evoke the architecture of the men's houses of the Banks Islands in the north of the archipelago. A photo enables one to place these different pieces in their context. All the left part of the exhibition is consecrated to the diverse representations of effigies of the ancestral spirits. Nine wooden masks from Pentecost and Ambrym present both by a rom mask and tamake masks with beards of vegetable fibers. But it is the creations of the island of Malakula that are the most numerous, with carved hairstyles to four multi-colored faces, masks covered with a light veil of spider webs, combs, temes nevimbur puppets, masquettes, various figures, and birds modeled over with a paste mixed from vegetal fibers. One figure of a fern tree and plant fibers, representing the ogress Nevimbumbao, sits in the place of honor on an arm chair where it was placed by the painter, Matisse, before he gave it to his friend, Picasso. This arm chair, which could seem incongruous to some, is a mark of the dialogue established for a long time between Western and Oceanic arts. This sculpture appears to be talking with the individual above, it is a pity that all these works, of great aesthetic inter est, have not benefitted from a larger space in the exhibition in order to enhance their respective qual ities. Two small cases, discreetly placed face to face, group together anthropomorphic stone sculptures. The space between these cases leads to a circular room, placed in semi-darkness, which evokes the atmosphere of men's houses at the bottom of which the funerary mannequins were formerly set down. In the corner of this room, a judiciously placed small opening allows one to admire the stone pieces in one of the cases from another angle. The eleven ram baramb, of different workmanship, brought togeth er in this room and placed in a semi-circle, face a modeled human head. One of them consists of two heads, while others have under their arms posts dec orated with masquettes of human faces. The colors of the paints vary considerably from piece to piece. It is undoubtedly the first time that such a number of rambaramb, coming from seven different muse ums, have been assembled for an exhibition. The left half of the large gallery is devoted to rit ual life. One can admire the wooden and stone dish es used for the preparation of oaplap and nalot, a very beautiful series of knives from the Torres Islands in wood and bamboo with carved handles to cut up food, a large pot from Santo, two carved ridge poles (ponarat) framing a series of carved ceremonial spears,flutes and ear ornaments of engraved bam boo, baskets from Pentecost, Ambae, and Maevo as well as tapa from Erromango, Efate, andTanna, rep resenting women's work. As for the right half, it is a pity that the mats and tapa are placed too close together, for they detract from the appreciation of their individual qualities. In contrast, the funerary mat, more than sixteen meters in length, complete ly unrolled in a long case, is very well exhibited, in so far as it is possible to have a view from above of these various effects from a platform placed parallel to it. The visitor ends his visit in the large illuminated rotunda in the middle of which has been construct ed a round platform where slit gongs, sculptures or rank in wood and fern tree are lined up imposingly, over which stands a bird with its wings spread out. Ceremonial adzes, pig-killers, jewelry in the form of pigs' teeth and pearl shell are presented in cases on the sides. All objects in this area evoke the village square where pigs were sacrificed during the great grade feasts.

The many colors of these masks show that their makers know how to use new possibilities that manufactured products offer them. Those in charge of the exhibition, Roger Boulay, Christian Kaufmann, and Kirk Huffman, have cho sen to give priority to the presentation of series of objects of the same kind. Such a choice allows the spectators to realize that the creation of an object does not rely solely on a particular technical func tion, but just as much on the desire of its creator to leave the imprint of his personality and imagination on the material. This beautiful exhibition only shows one side of the arts of Vanuatu. The performing arts (dance, song, poetry, and theater) are only diffidently pre sented in a video program visible in the Oceania hall of the museum. A conference and concert took place on 30 October, during which the evocation of designs on sand by Marc Chemellier, ethnomusi cologist, was related to a composition of Tom Johnson's performed by the saxophonist, Daniel Kientzy. Showings of hlms took place in December 1997 and January 1998. The catalogue has been published in three lan guages, but, unfortunately, the Fench version was not available in the bookstore of the Musée National des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oceanie. This catalogue of 368 pages, profusely illustrated with maps, drawings, and photographs in color and black and white, pre sents in some 50 articles the different aspects of the art of Vanuatu. This work will become the indis pensable reference for anyone who is interested in the arts of this country. It has been accomplished by Joël Bonnemaison, Kirk Huffman, Christian Kaufmann and Darell Tryon, and is published by the Réunion des Musées Nationaux. An English translation, Arts of Vanuatu, is published by Crawford House Publishing. A catalogue in German, Vanuatu, Kunst aus der Siidsee, has been produced by Christian Kaufmann and published by Christoph Merian Verlag, but the illustrations and text are different from the English and French ver sions.
