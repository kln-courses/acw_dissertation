Boston: Gambit Inc. 1969. Pp. xxv, 505; 44 figures. $10.00. CLASSICISTS SHOULD NOT be misled by the title: this book is not a literary essay about Hamlet. It is an "essay" only in the sense that it is an attempt by two historians of science (one of them familiar to Classicists through papers on Eudoxus, Philolaus, and Parmenides) to fructify the work of Bell, Gundel, et al. on the astronomical myths of antiquity for key-areas of comparative mythology at large, viz., in particular, for the numerous, unbelievably detailed, and hitherto unexplained agreements that obtain between mythological motifs from all over the globe like those of a Golden Age, in which gods, men and the dead communed with one another, of great mill- stones grinding away and then being unhinged, of Floods and Gotterdaimmerung, of gods or men falling or being hurled from the sky, of one cosmic ruler being replaced and relegated to the Nether World by another, who must himself go down there to bring back new norms, names, and dignities, etc. "Hamlet" happens to be associated with the millstone-motif cited. For in the Scandinavian- Irish prototype of Saxo's Danicizing version of the familiar story, one Amlodhi appears as the owner of one such mill, which later comes unhinged and sinks to the bottom of the sea. Capital- izing on the common reader's putative familiarity with and interest in the Hamlet-story, our authors plunge him in medias res, and by a skillful alternation of narrative and expository chapters, by a wise relegation of much of the detailed infrastructure to footnotes and a host of learned appendices, and last not least by their lively and occasionally even irreverent style capture and hold the reader's interest. Throughout, they hold themselves commendably aloof from any general</page><page sequence="2">82 OCTOBER - NOVEMBER, 1973 notion of preconception, however fashionable, and try to let the facts speak for themselves as much as possible. They approach the curious agreements cited in the light of what other evidence (heortological, iconographic, archaeological, astronomical) has independently shown to be Late Neolithic man's capacity for sustained and superior observation, calculation, and engineering per- formance. Witness our evidence on archaic festival-cycles, Bell's and Hartner's proof of the amazing continuity (p. 424), ever since 4000 B.C., of the astronomico-astrological iconography East and West, Hawkins' computerized decoding of the 56-year lunar eclipse cycle built into the Stonehenge alignments (p. 69), or von Martiny's proof that the angular values of the corrections periodically introduced into the axial alignments of many Near Eastern sanctuaries equalled and thus offset those of the precessional shift for the same periods. The celestial mapping-feats in question are far too technical, then as now, to have been achieved or even understood (as against appreciated and transmitted) by anyone but a small, expert minority at any given time. Yet they suffice to prove hollow the notion, born of the illicit projection of the time-scale of biological evolution onto the time-scale applicable to the history of Homo Sapiens, of "primitives" beholden to mythological day-dreams and fertility-cults. What is more, they suffice to establish concern with astronomical matter of high complexity as a presumptive ingredient of the intellectual background against which mythology must be interpreted. It is this presumption which our authors succeed in converting into virtual certainty. Comparing their vast array of remarkably detailed correspondences between the mythological motifs earlier cited to the equally vast spectrum from which it has been drawn (scil. from ancient Greece, classical China, contemporary N-W Africa, North and Central America, Mesopotamia, Polynesia, and Scandinavia), they conclude that beyond the common language there is a common subject-matter and that recurrent crises of cosmic proportions bulk large in it. All indications point to the conclusion that the crises in question are in fact those occasioned by the precessional drift, which moving at the slow but inexorable rate of about one degree every seventy- two years gradually condemns to obsolescence any given definition of those points, equinoctial and solstitial, on the ecliptic by which man takes his bearings. Others have seen the general, cosmologi- cal import in such stories as that of the Mill Unhinged or the Tower of Babel. Our authors succeed in evincing a specific reference to the periodic orientation-crisis which comes to a head whenever the vernal point has completed its shift, about every 2000 years, from one zodiacal constellation to the next. Mythological motifs, then, seem to confirm the mute testimony of axial alignments repeatedly corrected - many centuries before Hipparchus described the phenomenon in terms of positional astronomy and Galileo finally explained it in terms of modern dynamics (p. 142-43). Implicit in both testimonies, of course, is the high human relevance associated with all matters astronomical for reasons, at least some of which are not unfamiliar to Classicists. After all, sky, atmosphere, and terrestrial waters are conceived as a single, Oceanic continuum, originating in the upper sky and flowing down by way of celestial rivers to the invisible South Pole; and man's spirit is, through his first ancestors, related to the fixed stars, whither by way of planetary regions and Galaxy he seeks to reascend in trance and after death (p. 308-09). As for the mythological motifs themselves, careful analysis and comparison evinces them as part of a truly technical language, in which complex stellar and planetary motion is described not, as in classical astronomy, by numerically fixing the successive positions which a moving object occupies, but by verbally "tracking" it through one complete cycle of encotnters, as in a filmstrip or a story. That and how, in an oral society, formal story-telling functions as the sole vehicle for transmitting klea andrin we have learnt from the work of Parry and Lord. What many of us did not realize till the work of Marcel Griaule and the book under review is that this very technique could and did assume the additional burden of transmitting, in the appropriate anthropomorphic and dramatic disguise, astronomical matter of high complexity for purposes aetiological, descriptive, or pre- dictive. If number was indeed the language of the gods, the knowledge of that language was at once technical and sacred. It served, if not to compel, yet magically to reinforce the repetitive, predict- able character of potentially terminal crises like those occasioned by eclipses and precession. "Like" would bc helped to triumph over "unlike," after all. To disguise that knowledge in the human language of (pseudo-) history (p. 48, 237, 313), (pseudo-) geography (p. 50, 57,190, 211), and (pseudo-) zoology (p. 249) was to assure it of accurate transmission yet also, and by the same token, of almost inevitable Euhemeristic misunderstanding by many rhapsodes and their audiences. That such misunderstanding and trivialization on "entropy" of myths, p. 389-390) could often be creative in its own right no student of popular poetry will want to deny (p. 119). To do equal justice, however, at once to the sacred content and to the human and dramatic integuments of a given myth was reserved to the contrapuntal genius of the greatest poets only. Magical formulae, of course, did on a lower level what mythological poetry did on a higher one: pass on the sacred, technical information from one generation of experts to the next in a form immune to the ravages</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 83 of oblivion and common sense alike (p. 148, 195, 223, 287). The "much demanded Oracle of Kronos, the so-called Little Mill" from the 4th century A.D. Paris Magical Papyrus (PGM, I. p. 64 Preisendanz) illuminates the point in a flash (p. 147). Here is the old story of Kronos' precessional Mill, sunken to the bottom of the "sea" at the end of the Golden Age, still alive in Late Antiquity. Students of doxography will be reminded of Diels' point that early material is often preserved in late authors, Latinists, of the habit of archaic forms, after centuries of subliterary existence, to resurface in Silver Latinity. So much for the bald outlines: the real fascination of the work resides, of course, in its wealth of supporting detail and in the new light which it casts on ostensibly familiar matters and texts. After the Introduction, Classicists intent on a firm impression might want to turn straight to the expository section (p. 56-75), then skip to chapters 8 - 14 and 17 - 19. They will find particularly illuminating the pages devoted to Socrates' Last Tale, i.e. Phaedo 107 D-115 A (p. 179-191), to Aristotle, Met. A 8, 1074 b 1 f(p. 4, 150), to the Timaean cosmogony, Tim. 55 C, and anthro- pogony, Tim. 41 E, (p. 187-188 and 306-309 respectively), to our authors' reasoned conclusion that "the Timaeus and, in fact, most Platonic myths, act like a floodlight that throws bright beams upon the whole of 'high mythology' ...." (p. 310, cf. 311,328), to Homer's Curse of the Miller Woman (p. 90), to Kronos/Chronos (p. 135, App. 12), to the system of Underworldly "rivers" in Hesiod, Theog. 775-814 and in the katabaseis of Odysseus (Homer, Od. 10.508 f.), Aeneas (Vergil, Aen. 6.264 f.), and Vergil (Dante, Inf. 7.102, 14.85) (p. 192-203), to Vergil's Messianic Eclogue (p. 245), to the various versions, Classical, Sumerian, Central American, of the story of Phaethon's Fall (p. 250-262), to the surname Boanerges in Mark 3:17 (p. 225 f.), to Plutarch's story of the death of the Great Pan (p. 275 f.), to the enigmatic end of the Odyssey (p. 315 f.), and to the Prometheus-story (p. 317 f.). A few suggestions toward a hoped for second edition may not be unwelcome. The reference to Hipparchus' discovery that the North Pole turns about the Ecliptic Pole (p. 143) might be reword- ed so as to avoid creating the impression that the discovery of the latter was a consequence of the discovery of the precessional phenomenon. Elsewhere (p. 135), our authors themselves rightly state that it is the obliquity of the Ecliptic itself, i.e., the solar year, which implies an Ecliptic Pole distinct from the North Pole, i.e., that, mythologically speaking, the mutilation of Ouranos pre- ceded, not followed, the start of the precession as embodied in Zeus' tilting of the "table", Phaethon's Fall, etc. Similarly, if the Lord walking with Adam in the Garden does correspond to Saturn dwelling among men (p. 222), Adam's subsequent expulsion from Paradies cannot (Milton's first option, P.L. 10.668 f., to the contrary notwithstanding: p. 135) refer to the establishment of the Ecliptic, but must refer to that of the precession, one World Age later. To avoid needlessly complicating access to this important book, the present index should be replaced by four separate indices: one of primary texts, one of proper names, one of topics, and one, in the form of a glossary, of technical turns of expression actually uncovered. The first of these is by far the most urgent. As for the learned appendices, they are far too important not to deserve brief headings summarizing their subject-matter, to be cross-referenced to the exact pages in the text to which they refer, and to have their running number, pages, page-reference, and subject-matter consolidated into a separate Table of Contents. According to the one I prepared for my own use, App. 9 lacks any reference in the text (should it be p. 93, line 3?), and the reference on p. 139 to "appendix 15" should be to 14, instead. The illustrations, too, should be assigned running numbers (1-44), captioned as to subject and origin, and cross-referenced to the pages in the text to which they refer. A schematic plan of Angkor (p. 162) would be welcome; the reference to elements in the last two lines of the caption to Kepler's conjunction-diagram (facing p. 134) should either be dropped or furnished with a reference to p. 399 to be intelligible; on the captions to the diagrams facing p. 142 and 143 the words "northern" and "southern" should be reversed; and a star-map showing the chief constellations in relation to Galaxy, Ecliptic, Equator, and colures could usefully replace one set of Eisler's precession-diagrams on the inside covers or, better still, the quaint polychrome that now adorns the wrapper. Very few of the misprints I found (and forwarded to the authors) affect comprehension, viz. p. 7, line 17: 9 x 12; p. 69, lines 19-20: ra(tio)ci(n)ation; p. 163, line 11 and p. 380, middle; p. 389, line 11: alternating; p. 211, line 3: Persian Gulf (not: Red Sea); p. 409, line 24: mansions (not: missions). Yet these are comparative trivia easily set right in the hoped for second edition. All one can say to one's fellow-Classicists in the meantime is, "Tollite, legite!". HARALD A.T.
