Janicki University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT The response of the head to impact was investigated using live anesthetized and post- mortem Rhesus monkeys and repressurized cadavers. The stationary test subject was struck by a guided moving impactor of 10 kg for monkeys; 25 or 65 kg for cadavers. The impactor striking surface was fitted with padding to vary the contact force-time characteristics. The experimental technique used a nine-accelerometer system rigidly mounted on the head to measure head motion, transducers placed at specific points below the skull to record epidural pressure, repressurization of both the vascular and cerebral spinal systems of the cadaver model, and high-speed cineradiography (at 400 or 1000 frames per second) of selected test subjects. The results of the tests demonstrate the potential importance of skull deformation and angular acceleration on the injury produced in the live Rhesus and the damage produced in both the post-mortem Rhesus and the cadaver as a result of impact. IN THE UNITED STATES roughly 49 percent of head injuries can be attributed to motor vehicle accidents (1-3)*. Investigation of trauma to the head and of mechanisms of injury becomes invaluable for allocating resources and for formulating policy to reduce its incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Because motor vehicle field accident data do not provide the level of detail necessary to ascertain mechanisms of injury resulting from the interactions of the passenger with the vehicle interior during an accident, bioengineers use trauma experiments with human surrogates (cadavers or animals) to document kinematic parameters so that mechanisms of injury can be better simulated, modeled and verified. *Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. The repressurized cadaver is often chosen as an experimental model because its geometry and soft tissue distribution is similar to that of a live human. Damages to repressurized cadavers which correlate well with clinically observed injuries are those that can be documented by gross autopsy. They include scalp lacerations (linear, flap, stellate), fractures of the cranial vault or base (linear, depressed, comminuted) , lesions which are visible to the naked eye and hemorrhage (petechia; contusion; epidural, subdural, subarachnoid and intracerebral hematomas). Mild concussion, cerebral concussion and diffuse brain injury disrupt the functioning of the brain without gross overt structural evidence. Because diagnosis of concussion requires the observation of behavioral responses, animal subjects are necessary in experimental contexts. As a result, subtle distinctions are lost, making scaling of the results to the human level approximate (4). The bioengineering literature on mechanisms of injury is a rich one (5-43). However, despite conscientious speculation as to the mechanics which produce head trauma and theoretical and experimental scrutiny of various hypotheses about it, considerable controversy still exists. The hypotheses usually cannot wholly fit clinical or pathological observations, assessment of biomaterial properties, or may not agree with predictions of mathematical models. Several such controversies involve angular and linear acceleration and skull deformation (5-8,12,16-17,21-22,34,38,40) . These debates are complicated by the complex mechanical structure of the head and brain. A number of biomechanical analyses (finite element analyses, in particular) have attempted to model the brain with reasonable geometric precision. However, these calculations involve over-simplified modeling of materials and behavior, assuming simple elasticity or homogeneous materials (12-13,23-24,38,41-44). A number of other investigators have attempted to define the 6.800 0096-736X/ 85/ 9306-0800$02 . 30 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">pressure-volume relationship of the skull to impact (19, 25-26, 28-30,32, 36, 43-44). However, the skull-brain interface as well as the effects of skull deformation on the impact response of the brain is not well understood. A major difficulty in the investigation of head trauma is designing kinematic experiments which interfere minimally with the biological and and physical systems being observed, yet produce results that correspond well with clinically observed trauma. Some understanding of head injury mechanisms as a result of blunt impact has resulted from relating kinematic parameters to injury modes. However, with the possibility of several injury mechanisms correlations of this type do not always imply causation. The parameters commonly used for describing head mechanical response during direct impact have been angular and translational accelerations, velocities, displacements of the head as a rigid body, skull bone deformations, and internal pressures in the brain. Many investigators have chosen to investigate a single parameter, such as resultant head acceleration for Head Injury Criterion (HIC) calculation, and later use it as an index of severity or tolerance threshold. This paper discusses techniques developed and used by the Biomechanics Group at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI ) for measuring three- dimensional head motion, epidural pressure, and internal brain motion of repressurized cadavers and Rhesus monkeys during head impact. The results will be compared to those previously presented (30,40) and a possible injury mechanism will be suggested. METHODOLOGY Three live anesthetized and three post- mortem Rhesus monkeys* and nine repressurized cadavers** were tested. Five cadavers were each subjected to a series of up to three head impacts using the UMTRI pneumatic impacting device with a 25 or 65 kg impactor. The remaining four cadavers were subjected to two head impacts each with the UMTRI pendulum impacting device with a 25 kg impactor. The cadavers were instrumented with a nine- * Animal s were handled according to the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and National Institutes of Health guidelines . ♦''The protocol for the use of cadavers in this study was approved by the Committee to Review Grants for Clinical Research of the University of Michigan Medical Center and follows guidelines established by the U.S. Public Health Service and recommended by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council. accelerometer array located on the head to measure three-dimensional motion. Epidural pressure transducers were used to monitor pressure changes during impact of the brain- skull interface. Both cerebrospinal and vascular systems of the cadaver head-brain complex were repressurized. In addition, high- speed photokinemetrics were obtained using normal photographic or cineradiographic techniques . Using the pneumatic impacting device with a 10 kg impactor, three live and three post-mortem non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) were each subjected to a single head impact to the occipital region. The six Rhesus subjects used in these experiments were obtained by UMTRI from the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM). The six Rhesus subjects were instrumented similarly to the cadavers with nine-accelerometer arrays on the head and with epidural pressure transducers to document transient pressures. For post-mortem Rhesus subjects, neither cerebrospinal nor vascular systems of the head-brain complex were repressurized. IMPACT TESTING - The methods and procedures used in this research are outlined below. Additional information can be found in (30-32,45-46) . Linear Pendulum Impact Device - The UMTRI linear pendulum impact device, using a free- falling pendulum as an energy source, strikes either a 25 kg or 56 kg impact piston. The piston is guided by a set of Thomson linear ball bushings. Axial loads were calculated from data recorded using a Setra Model 111 accelerometer. Impact conditions between tests were controlled by varying impact velocity and the type and depth of padding on the impactor surface. Piston velocity was measured by timing the pulses from a magnetic probe which senses the motion of the targets in the piston. A specially designed timer box was used to control and synchronize the impact events during a particular test, such as the release of the pendulum and activation and deactivation of the lights and high-speed cameras. Ballistic Impact Device - The UMTRI ballistic impact device (Figure 1), consists of an air reservoir, a ground and honed cylinder, and a carefully fitted piston mechanically coupled to a ballistic pendulum. The piston, propelled by compressed air through the cylinder from the air reservoir chamber, accelerates the ballistic pendulum. The mass of the ballistic pendulum can be varied from 10 to 150 kg. The piston is arrested at the end of its travel allowing the ballistic pendulum to become a free-traveling impactor. The ballistic pendulum is fitted with an inertia-compensated load cell. Nine-Accelerometer Head Plate - For Rhesus subjects, the installation of the nine- accelerometer plate is accomplished as follows. 6.801</page><page sequence="3">6.802 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. Fig. 1. Pneumatic Ballistic Pendulum and Test Setup for Cadaver Impacts. The scalp is removed from the frontal bone over the orbital ridges. Several metal self-tapping screws are attached firmly to the skull through small pilot holes drilled into the orbital ridges and into the dental plate above the canine teeth. Quick-setting acrylic plastic is molded around each of the screws and the base of the plate mount embedding it in the plastic. The orientation of the plate in this position is shown in Figure 2. For cadavers, the nine-accelerometer plate is installed in the following manner. A two-by- two inch patch of scalp is removed from the right occipital-parietal area. Four small screws are then placed in a trapezoidal pattern in the skull within the dimensions of the accelerometer plate mount. Quick setting acrylic plastic is molded around the screws forming a base. The plate mount is then placed in the acrylic base. See Figure 3A for the location of the plate mount. Fig. 2. Nine-Accelerometer Plate Position for Rhesus Monkey Impacts. It is necessary to determine the instrumentation frame's exact location and orientation in relation to the anatomical frame. A three-dimensional x-ray technique was developed which requires taking two orthogonal radiographs of the instrumented head. The procedure requires the identification of four anatomical landmarks (two superior edges of the auditory meati and two infraorbital notches) with four distinguishable lead pellets, plus the identification of four lead pellets inlaid in the plate to define the instrumentation frame. A similar radiographic technique was used with Rhesus monkeys to determine the orientation and location of the instrumentation frame with respect to the anatomical frame. Epidural Pressure Measurements - Epidural pressures of Rhesus subjects are obtained with a Kulite model MCP-55-5F catheter tip pressure transducer. For cadavers, Endevco series 8510 piezoresistive pressure transducers are used. Fig. 3A. Nine-Accelerometer Plate Position for Cadaver Imp acts . 3B. Location of Transducers for Epidural Pressures 1, 2, 3, and 4.</page><page sequence="4">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.803 For Rhesus subjects a small circle of scalp is removed and a Stryker bone coring tool is used to make a hole in the skull with a circular bit. An adjustable set-screwed collet is used to core into the skull in small increments, preventing damage to the dura mater. The increment of bone is then removed using a dental scoop, and the hole is tapped for a coarse thread. A tabular magnesium coupling device is screwed into the tapped hole in the skull (Figure 4A) . It is anchored into place using quick-setting acrylic plastic molded around the base. Dow Corning dielectric gel (silicon fluid) is injected into the tubing to act as a coupling medium. The Kulite pressure transducer is then inserted and secured at proper depth. Fig. 4A. Magnesium Coupling Device. 4B. Skull Bone Coring Device. For cadaver subjects four 1 cm diameter circles of scalp are removed over the frontal, parietal and occipital bones and a Stryker bone coring tool is used to make four holes in the skull with a circular bit (Figure 4B) . Holes are placed out of the contact area of the impacting surface and are not drilled into sutures (Figure 3B) . The dura mater under these holes is perforated without cutting the brain. The holes are tapped. The brass transducer couplings are inserted into the tapped holes. Two pinhead screws are attached 2 cm from each transducer. Quick-setting acrylic plastic is molded around the pinhead screws and the mouth of each transducer coupling as a mooring device. After checking fluid flow, the Endevco series 8510 piezoresistive pressure transducers are attached to the fittings. Radiopaque Target Gel - A neutral density radiopaque gel is used to determine motion of the brain during impact. The gel is injected into the brain through the holes used for insertion of the pressure transducers. The injection technique produces lines of radio- contrast in the brain that show up in high-speed cineradiographic movies. See Figure 5. Fig. 5. Radiograph and Reconstruction of Radiograph With Radio-contrast Dye in situ. X-Ray Motion Descriptors - The procedures used for defining x-ray motion descriptors are explained in (45) and briefly outlined below. The cineradiograph system allows non-invasive viewing of internal anatomical structure in vivo. In the case of a rigid structure such as bone, the radiopaque targets can be placed on or near anatomical landmarks and motion can be described similarly to that of standard photometric techniques. Problems arise when soft tissue is to be analyzed and rigid body dynamics no longer offer a good approximation.</page><page sequence="5">6.804 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. Several methods could be suggested to produce analytical information describing the soft tissue of the brain. In this paper the motion discriptors chosen are based upon the shadows of objects in a two-dimensional image space produced by a point source of x-rays which are associated with the anatomical structures or the radiopaque dye injected into the brain. The descriptors are at most two-dimensional and do not take into account rotations and translations which move objects in and out of the plane of gross whole body motion. In addition, changes in the x-ray cross-section of objects can lead to changes in the descriptors which do not have a direct relation to rigid body motion. In the impact tests presented in this paper radiopaque gel was injected into the head producing four curved lines in the brain and outlining the ventricles in some tests. Differential motion between the brain and the skull was obtained by comparing the motion of points on the curve closest to the center of the epidural pressure transducer. General characteristics of the motion of the brain were obtained through the changes in shape of the curved lines and ventricles . Cadaver Vascular Repressurization - To pressurize the cadaver vascular system of the head, the common carotid artery is located at a point in the neck and an incision is made. (See Figure 6.) A balloon catheter is inserted and positioned such that the balloon is in the internal carotid artery just above the point where the external carotid artery branches. A narrow polyethylene tube is inserted at the same point and runs into the internal carotid artery just past the balloon. A Kulite pressure transducer is then fed through this tube so that vascular pressure may be monitored. Finally, the vertebral arteries are tied off above the clavicle such that fluid pressure in the head may be maintained. Just prior to testing, a solution of India ink and saline is released from a tank into the vascular system of the head. A pressure transducer monitors the flow so that the system is brought to normal physiological pressure just prior to impact. Fig. 6. Vascular Pressurization Procedure and Placement. Cadaver Cerebrospinal Repressurization - For the cadaver head impacts, the subdural region surrounding the brain and spinal cord is repressurized by coring a small hole into the second lumbar vertebra and inserting a Foley catheter under the dura of the spinal cord such that the balloon of the catheter reaches mid- thorax level. To check fluid flow through the ventricles, saline is injected through the Foley catheter until fluid rises to the top of the piezoresistive pressure transducer couplings. The couplings are capped until the radiopaque sodium iodide gel target has been slowly injected through the couplings into the brain cortex and a setup radiograph has been made of the head. The point at which the catheter passes through the lamina of the second lumbar vertebra is sealed with plastic acrylic. (Figure 7) Fig. 7. Cerebrospinal Pressurization Pro- cedure and Placement. Test Subject Preparation - The unembalmed cadavers were stored at 4 degrees centigrade prior to testing. The cadaver is x-rayed as part of the structural damage evaluation and anthropomorphic measurements are recorded. Next, the cadaver is instrumented, sanitarily, dressed and transported to the testing room where the accelerometers and pressure transducers are attached. The subject is positioned. Next, the radiopaque gel target is inserted, and pretest x-rays and photographs are taken. Pressurization is checked. Then the subject is impacted. Each cadaver received either two duplicate head impacts or one low-</page><page sequence="6">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.805 Fig. 8. Test Setup for Posterior-Anterior Rhesus Head Impact. energy heavy-padded frontal impact and one medium energy slightly-padded frontal impact. Three Rhesus impacts were conducted on post-mortem subjects. Upon termination, they were stored in a cooler at 4 degrees centigrade for 48 hours before testing. Living Macacas were used in the other three experiments. The protocol for post-mortem animals was less complex than that for the live animals, which was presented earlier (32), outlined below. The subject is first anesthetized with ketamine and then maintained with ket amine and sodium pentobarbital. An airway is established. The upper body is prepared and the weight and biometrie measurements are taken. Using a cauterizing scalpel, the scalp and muscle mass are removed from the frontal bone and the screws used to affix the nine-accelerometer plate and the epidural pressure transducer skull fitting are screwed into place. Figure 8 shows the positioning of the instrumentation on the Rhesus skull. The Rhesus is placed in an erect sitting position with its posterior side towards the impactor, so that the line of impact is in the mid-sagittal plane in the posterior-anterior direction. The Rhesus is stabilized with paper tape. A polaroid photograph is then taken through the cineradiograph to check the position of the animal and the x-ray settings. Figure 8 also shows the basic test setup. Eight hours after impact, a 5 ml dose of Uthol (concentrated, unpure sodium pentobarbital) is injected via the hind leg I.V. catheter to euthanize the animal. Rhesus Initial Test Conditions - The tests being reported here are a continuation of Rhesus tests reported earlier (30). Conditions for this set of tests were similar except higher impact energy levels were used and the subjects were positioned so that impact occurred through the estimated center of mass. The impactor was the UMTRI 10 kg pneumatic impacting device and the impacting surface was 10 cm in diameter and padded with 2.5 cm Ensolite. Cadaver Initial Test Conditions - Tests 82E001 thru 82E062 used the UMTRI 25 kg linear pendulum impacting device with a 15 cm diameter impacting surface padded with 2.5 cm Ensolite. Tests 82E081 thru 84E141D used the UMTRI 25 kg ballistic impacting device fitted with a 15 cm diameter impacting surface padded with 2.5 cm Ensolite, or a sandwich of 2.5 cm styrofoam, 5 cm Dow Ethafoam plus 2.5 cm Ensolite, or one of 0.5 cm Ensolite, 5 cm seating foam plus 0.5 cm Ensolite. Tests 84E151A through 84E161C used the UMTRI 65 kg ballistic impacting device fitted with a 15 cm diameter impacting surface padded with either 0.5 cm Ensolite or a sandwich of 0.5 Ensolite, 5 cm seating foam, and 0.5 cm Ensolite. The target area for all of these impacts was the center of the forehead above the orbits (frontal). Impact occurred in the anterior to posterior direction. All cadavers were seated and positioned with paper tape so that the subject and the impact target were stable (Figure 9) . Cineradiographs - In selected subjects high-speed cineradiographs were taken (some cadavers and all Rhesus). The cineradiographs were taken of the impact events at 1000 or 400 frames per second. The UMTRI high-speed cineradiographic system (47-48) consists of either a Photosonics IB or Miliken high-speed 16 mm motion-picture camera which views a 5 cm diameter output phosphor of a high-gain, four- stage, magnetically focused image intensifier tube, gated on and off synchronously with shutter pulses from the motion-picture camera. A lens optically couples the input photocathode of the image intensifier tube to x-ray images produced on a fluorescent screen by a smoothed direct-current x-ray generator. Smoothing of the full-wave rectified x-ray output is accomplished by placing a pair of high-voltage capacitors in parallel with the x-ray tube. The viewing field for these experiments was between 20 and 40 cm. Photokinemetrics - The motion of the subject was determined from the high-speed (1000 frames per second) film by following the motion of single-point phototargets on the head and on the impactor piston. For selected cadaver frontal impacts, a Hycam camera operating at 3000 frames per second provided a close-up</page><page sequence="7">6.806 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL* Fig. 9. Initial Conditions for Cadaver Frontal Head Impact. lateral view of the impact. For selected cadaver frontal impacts the Photosonics provided a lateral 1000 frames per second overall view. Data Handling - All transducer time histories (impact force, impact acceleration, epidural pressures, nine head-accelerations) were recorded unfiltered on either a Honeywell 7600 FM Tape Recorder or a Bell and Howell CEC 3300/CEC 3400 FM Tape Recorder. A synchronizing gate was recorded on all tapes. All data was recorded at 30 ips. The analog data on the FM tapes was played back for digitizing through proper anti-aliasing analog filters. The analog-to-digital process for all data, results in a digitial signal sampled at 6400 Hz equivalent sampling rate. It has been reported that skull vibrations above 1300 Hz could cause very local motion in the accelerometer mountings (40). To reduce this effect, the raw transducer time histories were filtered, digitally, with a Butterworth filter at 1000 Hz, 6th order. METHOD OF ANALYSIS - The techniques used to analyze the results are outlined below. Additional information can be found in (30-32,41-42). Frame Fields - As the head moves through space, any point on the head generates a path in space. In head injury research we are interested in the description of the path of the anatomical center and in events which occur as it moves. A very effective tool for analyzing the motion of such a point (the anatomical center), as it moves along a curved path in space, is the concept of a moving frame (49-52). The path generated as the point travels through space is a function of time and velocity. A vector field is a function which assigns a uniquely defined vector to each point along a path. Thus, any collection of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors defined on a path is a frame field. Therefore, any vector defined on the path (for example, acceleration) may be resolved into three orthogonal components of any well-defined frame field, such as the laboratory or anatomical reference frames. Changes in a frame field with time (for example, angular acceleration of the frame field) are interpreted as vectors defined on the curve and are also resolved into three components. In biomechanics research, frame fields are defined based on anatomical reference frames. Other frame fields such as the Frenet-Serret frame or the Principal Direction Triad (32,46), which contain information about the motion embedded in the frame field, have also been used to describe motion resulting from impact. The Frenet-Serret frame (51-52) consists of three mutually orthogonal vectors T, N, B. At any point in time a unit vector can be constructed that is co-directional with the velocity vector. This normalized velocity vector defines the tangent direction T. A second unit vector N is constructed by forming a unit vector co-directional with the time derivative of the tangent vector T (the derivative of a unit vector is normal to the vector). To complete the orthogonal frame, a third unit vector B (the unit binormal) can be defined as the cross product T x N. This procedure defines a frame at each point along the path of the anatomical center. Within the frame field, the linear acceleration is resolved into two distinct types. The tangent acceleration [Tan(T)] is always the rate of change of speed (absolute velocity) and the normal acceleration [Nor (N) ] gives information about the change in direction of the velocity vector. The binormal direction contains no acceleration information. Transfer Function Analysis - With blunt impacts, the relationship between a transducer time history at a given point and the transducer time history of another given point of a system can be expressed in the frequency domain through the use of a transfer function. A Fast Fourier Transformation of simultaneously monitored transducer time histories can be used to obtain the frequency response functions of impact force and accelerations of remote points. Once obtained, a transfer function of the form: (Z) (iw) = (w) F[F(t) ]/ F [A(t) ] can be calculated from the transformed quantities where w is the given frequency, and F[F(t)] and F[A(t)] are the Fourier transforms of the impact forces and acceleration of the</page><page sequence="8">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.807 point of interest, at the given frequency. This particular transfer function is closely related to a mechanical transfer impedance (53) which is defined as the ratio between simple harmonic driving force and corresponding velocity of the point of interest. Mechanical transfer impedance is a complex valued function which for the purpose of presentation will be described by its magnitude and its phase angle. In addition to a transfer function relating force to velocity, a transfer function can be generated which relates the response of one point in the system to another point in the system, the response being expressed in the frequency domain. Analogous to mechanical impedance, a Fast Fourier Transformation of simultaneously monitored transducer time histories from any two points in the system can be used to obtain the frequency response functions relating those two points. In the case of a force and a pressure, such as impact force and epidural pressure, a transformation of the form: (X) (iw) = F [F ( t ) ]/ F[p(t) ] can be calculated from the transformed quantities, where w is the given frequency, PCF ( t ) ] and F[p(t)] are the Fourier transforms of the impact force time history and the pressure time history. Correlation Functions - To describe some of the fundamental properties of a time history, such as acceleration or force, two types of statistical measures may be used: 1. Auto-correlation Function. This measure is the correlation between two points on a time history and is a measure of the dependence of the amplitude at time t on the amplitude at t2. 2. Cross-correlation Function. This is a measure of how predictable, on the average, a signal (transducer time history) at any particular moment in time is from a second signal at any other particular moment in time. The auto-correlation function is formally defined as the average over the ensemble of the product of two amplitudes: + 00 +00 ^x^i'^2^ ~ J J ' ^2 ' ^ ^1 ' X2 ' ^1 ' ^2 ^*i ' ^^2 -oo-oo where x^, x2 are the amplitudes of the time history and p(x ,x2,t ,t ) is the joint probability density. Normally the above definition cannot be used to generate an auto- correlation function directly. However, it can be shown that for a discrete time history of a finite duration, a close approximation of the auto-correlation function can be obtained through the use of a Fourier transform. (53) In addition to auto-correlation, cross- correlation can be used to obtain useful information about the relationship between two different time histories. For example, the cross-correlation between acceleration measurements at two different points of a material body may be determined for the purpose of studying the propagation of differential motion through the material body. Cross- correlation functions are not restricted to correlation of parameters with the same physical units; for example, one might determine the cross-correlation between the applied force and the acceleration response to that force. Similar to the auto-correlation function, the calculation of the cross-correlation of two signals begins by taking the Fourier transform of both time histories (Y ,Y2). The cross- spectral density is the comp lex -va lu ed function (Y1 . Y2* ) . The cross correlation is then the Fourier transform of the cross-spectral density. (53) Pressure Time Duration Determination - Two different types of pressure-time histories were observed, unimodal and bimodal. The unimodal waveform was characterized by one maximum and the bimodal waveform by two local maxima. In order to define the pressure duration, a standard procedure was adopted which determined the beginning and end of a pulse. This procedure began by determining the peak, or the first peak in the case of a bimodal waveform. Next, the left half of the pulse, defined from the point where the pulse starts to rise to the time of peak, was least-squares fitted with a straight line. This rise line intersected the time axis at a point which was taken as the formal beginning of the pulse. A similar procedure was followed for the right half of this pulse, i.e., a least-squares straight line was fitted to the fall section of the pulse, which was defined from the peak to the point where the pulse minimum occurred. The point where this line intersected the time axis was the formal end of the pulse in the unimodal case, and the formal end of the first peak in the bimodal case. The pressure duration for a unimodal waveform was defined by these points. For a bimodal waveform, these two points were used to determine the first pressure duration. Another least-squares straight line was fitted to the fall section of the second pulse. The point at which this line intersected the time axis was the formal end of the waveform, and the total pressure duration was then defined from this point and the beginning point. Force Time History Determination - In general the force-time histories were unimodal with a single maximum, smoothly rising, peaking and then falling. Paddings on the striker</page><page sequence="9">6.808 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. surface effected different force-time history durations. Force duration was determined using the same techniques for determining pressure duration , that is the same boundary defining and least-squares straight-line fitting techniques were used. RESULTS Table 1 lists the initial test conditions for the Rhesus subjects while Table 2 lists those for cadaver subjects. Table 3 summarizes the Rhesus impacts and Table 4 summarizes the cadaver impacts. Table 5 characterizes impact pressures for cadavers. Table 6 reports the injuries/damages for the Rhesus subjects for which kinematic response was reported earlier (30) and Table 7 reports on injuries/damages for Rhesus subjects for which the kinematic response is being reported here. Table 8 reports the damage observed in cadaver subjects. A gross inspection was carried out for each test subject. In addition, representative microscopic sections were examined histologically for each Rhesus brain and included samples from the following areas: frontal cortex, anterior commisure level, mammilary body level, hoppocampus at lateral geniculate level, occipital cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, pons, medulla, and spinal cord. Selected time histories in the appendix are examples of important kinematic factors associated with the research performed in this project. The variables these examples illustrate are tangential and normal acceleration, resultant acceleration, rate of change of the tangential vector (T-rate) and rate of change of the binormal vector (B-rate) .

Coded "no injury"</page><page sequence="16">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.815 DISCUSSION The results of a series of head impact research programs conducted during the past five years at UMTRI are presented. The tests entail different initial conditions, human surrogates, impact directions, and locations for the recording instruments. Therefore, in order to compare tests, frame- independent variables and Frenet-Serret vectors are used for examination and analysis. Frame-independent variables include resultant angular and linear velocities and accelerations. Vectors expressed in the Frenet-Serret frame field include tangential acceleration, normal acceleration, T-rate and B- rate. The features of the data discussed in this section in abbreviated form represent trends that may be important factors in head impact response. In particular, the potential effect of skull deformation on head angular acceleration as well as on impact and injury response appears significant. FORCE TIME HISTORIES - Force time histories of repressurized cadaver tests are divided into two types which correlate well with fracture and non-fracture cases. In non-fracture cases, the force rises smoothly to a maximum and drops smoothly to zero. In fracture cases, although the force rises smoothly to a maximum, the drop to zero has a greater number of inflections or local maxima and is of longer duration. Fracture cases include Tests 82E001 and 84E151B. Test 82E001 is illustrated in the appendix. Non-fracture impacts of repressurized cadavers can be broken into two groups consisting of long and short-duration impacts. Short-duration impacts are those lasting less than 15 ms? long-duration impacts are defined as 15 ms or longer. In some cases, such as Test 83E102, durations as long as 60 ms were recorded. In the appendix Test 82E041 illustrates a short duration impact and Test 84E161A illustrates a long duration impact. Force time histories of Rhesus impacts can also be divided into two types which correlate well with non-fracture (or simple linear fracture) and basilar fracture. In the non- f racture/simple linear fracture group (Test 79A251 in the appendix), the force time history smoothly rises to a maximum and drops smoothly to zero. However, as with the repressurized cadaver, in cases with complex basilar fractures (Test 79A253 in the appendix), the force smoothly rose to a maximum, but fell with a greater number of inflections and/or local maxima of longer durations. The energy released from the skull appears to affect the force time history of repressurized cadaver subjects, but not Rhesus subjects, in non-fracture/simple linear fracture cases. Possibly, the Rhesus neck-head soft tissue muscle mass buffers the effect of fracture until "significant fracture" (complex basilar fracture) has occurred. TANGENTIAL ACCELERATION TIME HISTORIES - The tangential acceleration time histories of repressurized cadavers divide into two groups that correlate well with subarachnoid hemorrhage or the absence of it. For those tests in which no subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed, the tangential acceleration had a single local maximum in the area of maximum acceleration. However, for those tests in which subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed, there were several local maxima in the area of maximum acceleration. For both live and post-mortem Rhesus, the multimodal tangential acceleration occurred when complex skull fracture (basilar skull fracture) was observed. When there was an absence of complex fracture, the tangential acceleration was unimodal and smooth in the area of the maximum acceleration for both live and post- mortem Rhesus. COMPARISON OF IMPACTS: CADAVER VARIABILITY To examine variability within cadaver subjects, some subjects received two similar impacts (Tests 82E001 thru 82E082). Figure 10 is an example of cross-and auto-correlations for Tests 82E021 X 82E022 and 82E061 X 82E062 and 82E021 X 82E061 . The figure represents the general trend observed in relating similar tests with different subjects to similar tests with the same subject in terms of force time histories. In general, it seems that force-time history as well as acceleration-time history vary more between subjects than between tests on the same subject. An analogous comparison for epidural pressures (not illustrated) shows equivalent variance between different subjects having similar impacts or between the same subject having similar impacts. This implies that experimental techniques associated with repressurization or with the effects of the post-mortem state may produce as much variance in the pressure time history response as do variations due to the population of test subjects . IMPACT RESPONSE - The motion of a rigid body in space is the result of generalized forces: the total force and the total torque about a suitable axis. The dynamic problem of the motion of the area of the skull local to the nine-accelerometer array can be interpreted in the same way. However, because of the complex interactions of the area of the skull local to the nine-accelerometer array with the other material bodies, (for example, the muscle soft tissues of the neck, the rest of the skull, the brain, or the impactor), serious problems can arise in determining which of the bodies is producing these generalized forces. For example, when the head receives an impact, several events occur: 1) stress waves are propagated from the impact site, 2) the skull starts to deform, and 3) the skull begins to move due to the impact, transmitting energy</page><page sequence="17">6.816 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. Fig. 10. Auto- and Cross-Correlation for Force Time History.</page><page sequence="18">HRAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.817 to the brain via the dura mater. Eventually, the waves are dissipated, the deformation of the skull recovers partially or fully on removal of the impact loads, and the acceleration of the skull comes primarily from forces generated from the brain and neck. If differential skull motion is severe, essentially due to either sufficient energy in the high frequency components of the force time history or sufficient peak force, the stresses at some point in the skull may exceed the failure strength of the bone, thereby producing fracture. The loads producing this type of impact are generally of shorter duration or contain a rise time sufficient to generate the nebessary high frequency components to fracture the skull. The motion of the entire skull as a rigid body as estimated by the nine- accelerometer array depends on the degree of skull deformation as well as on the degree of precision being used in the investigation. If the skull deformations are small during and after impact, and the accelerometers are sufficiently far from the impact contact point, then valid rigid body motion can be assumed. However, if skull deformations are significant, then three-dimensional motion of the nine- accelerometer array and of the skull local to its instrumentation mount can only be used to estimate the motion of the rest of the skull through the use of an "estimated anatomical center." Interpretation of the results from the nine-accelerometer array must, therefore, take into account the non-rigid body motion taking place during "significant skull deformation" impacts. Using translations obtained from x- rays, three-dimensional approximate motion of an "estimated anatomical center" can be determined. Impact Response Définit ion -With the use of the UMTRI nine-accelerometer array it is possible to record three-dimensional six- degrees-of-freedom motion of an area of the the skull in which the accelerometers are located. Therefore, head impact response can be defined as a continuum of "events" characterized by the path traced by the motion of the "estimated anatomical center," all the vectors defined on that path, and by changes of the associated frame fields. Physically this implies that head impact response is interpreted as the response of a material body (the nine-accelerometer array and area of the skull local to it) in contact with other material bodies. The curve and the vectors generated as the "estimated anatomical center" moves in time are, therefore, a result of the interactions of the skull-mount area with other material bodies. Examples of events which are used to characterize head impact are: the initiation of head impact response (denoted by Q on the tangential acceleration time histories in the appendix); the positive maximum of the tangential acceleration time history (denoted by Q2 in the accompanying data) ; and the negative maximum of the tangential acceleration time history (denoted by Q3 in the accompanying data) . In research reported earlier in which similar Qļf and events were defined (38), the tangential acceleration rose smoothly to a single maximum and fell smoothly until crossing zero. In some of the tests being reported here the time interval near contains several local maxima, therefore direct comparison is complex. Nevertheless, these defined events can be used to compare different types of impacts for the same human surrogate and to compare the response of one type of human surrogate to another. THE EFFECTS OF SKULL DEFORMATION ON LINEAR AND ANGULAR ACCELERATION - Inspection of the three-dimensional motion of the skull local to the accelerometers, epidural pressure transducer response, and contact forces showed that skull deformation may have important implications for injury produced in blunt head impact. For repressurized cadaver tests with time histories having unimodal peaks of the tangential acceleration of the "estimated anatomical center," the time interval between the events is probably primarily a result of the interaction of the impactor with the skull. During the interval, the "estimated anatomical center" does not move more than 1 cm and the motion is to some extent three-dimensional. This is indicated by the rate of change of the tangent vector (T-rate) and binormal vector (B-rate). (A positive T- rate implies a curvature of the path or two- dimensional motion; significant T and B rate imply a torsion of the path or three-dimensional motion.) However, the angular acceleration is small or non-existent, and when present lies principally in the binormal direction. The normal acceleration of a point on the skull of closest approach to the impactor was found to be less than that of the "estimated anatomical center." (Reduced normal acceleration implies a "straighter" path of that point.) These measurements of angular and normal acceleration imply that the skull may be rotating about a point of closest approach to the impactor. For those tests with time histories displaying multimodal peaks of the tangential acceleration of the "estimated anatomical center" in the neighborhood of the Q event, the time interval between the events is also probably primarily a result or the interaction of the impactor and skull. However, in these these tests skull deformations seem to have significant effect on the angular, tangential, and normal acceleration responses. Comparison of this multimodal impact response (Test 82E041 in the appendix) to the unimodal tangential acceleration response (Test 82E061 in the appendix), shows that the following variables are greater during the Q1'Q2 interval: angular acceleration, normal acceleration, T-rate and B-</page><page sequence="19">6.818 G* S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. rate. This implies that for the multimodal type of impact, the path of the "estimated anatomical center" is, to a greater degree than for the unimodal pattern impacts, moving in a three- dimensional manner and that this increased three-dimensional motion correlates well with the angular acceleration. Comparison of the ratios of peak angular acceleration and velocity during the interval to those of peak angular acceleration and velocity during the QjrQß interval indicates that for a given test subject there is respectively more angular acceleration during the Qļ~Q2 interval for the multimodal impacts. In addition, the local maxima of the angular velocities in the multimodal impact as well as the rapid rotation of the binormal and normal vectors of between jc/2 and z radians indicates that the path of the "estimated anatomical center" has passed an inflection point near the Q- event. This is most evident when the skull fractures. In a skull fracture test, the head is loaded very rapidly (e.g., Test 82E001, the force drops while the tangential acceleration drops below zero). This is accompanied by a short-lived rotation of the skull which produces a local maximum in the angular velocity. Subsequent to fracture, the skull is in more complete contact with the impactor. The tangential acceleration increases, the angular velocity decreases, and the angular acceleration reverses direction. In general, the head is modeled as a rigid body when interpreting angular acceleration from nine accelerometers . However, the complex nature of the skull (4,24,54-55) causes asymmetric loading during blunt impact, which leads to an interpretation of an angular acceleration by the nine-accelerometer array that is not directly related to rigid body motion. Therefore, in addition to local skull bending in the area of the nine-accelerometer array, a second mechanism of skull deformation which causes the accelerometers to interpret angular acceleration can be hypothesized. A schematic display of this type of response is presented in Figure 11 to illustrate the effect of skull deformation on angular acceleration (a rotation is produced). The figure demonstrates the type of motion that might occur and is not necessarily representative of motion actually observed. Also, motion of the skull is not necessarily in the anterior-posterior , inferior-superior plane. Because angular displacement is small, movements are best detected through evaluation of angular acceleration. Because angular acceleration is an acceleration gradient over displacement at a given instant in time, the results of the linear acceleration are influenced by the angular acceleration. Thus, the differences in the neighborhood of the Q2 event between the multimodal aspect and the unimodal aspect of the tangential acceleration of the "estimated anatomical center" are a result of the acceleration gradient caused by the angular acceleration. Figure 12 represents the mechanical impedance corridor of force and tangential acceleration for repressurized cadaver tests in which skull deformation was observed and no skull fracture occurred (81E021, 82E022, 82E041, 82E042, and 84E141) . The impedance values for these impacts are similar to driving point impedance tests reported by other researchers (19-20,27,33,39-40,56). This implies that the skull deformation observed could be related to the same type of skull deformation obtained from the driving point impedance tests mentioned above. The results from Tests 84E161A and 84E161B support this conclusion. This test subject had the thickest skull of any of the subjects tested. Both Tests 84E161A and 84E161B were at low severity HIC values of 70 and 400, respectively. If the results of the impedance are primarily a result of skull deformation, then it would be expected that the tests would look more like those of a rigid body. In the frequency range between 10 and 1000 Hz this is, Fig. 11. Schematic Representations of Skull Deformation and Potential Effect on Angular Accelerations.</page><page sequence="20">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.819 indeed, the case for Test 84E161A (Figure 13). However, for Test 84E161B there is a slight difference between its response and that of a rigid body at the low frequency. This is, perhaps, the result of the differential movement of soft tissue. The results reported here extend the studies of the kinematic response of non-human primates (30) and cadavers (40) to blunt impacts. The earlier reports showed some of the differences in kinematic response between non- human primates and cadavers to be attributable to two factors: soft tissue distribution and skull geometry. In the present study, skull fracture and non-skull fracture tests were analyzed for both Rhesus and cadavers. The difference between fracture and non-fracture impact response was found to be greater for cadavers. This is illustrated by the following tests presented in the appendix: non-fracture Rhesus, 78A241; fracture Rhesus, 79A249 and 79A251; non-fracture cadavers, 82E061; fracture cadavers, 82E001. Differences may be attributed to: 1) the nine- accelerometer array in Rhesus tests are mounted in an area that is to some degree more removed from the calvarium (the accelerometers are mounted on the orbital ridges of the face of the Rhesus), 2) the mounting site in the Rhesus is more massive with respect to the rest of the skull than that of the mounting site for cadavers (the instrumentation is the same size, but the Rhesus head is much smaller than the cadaver head), 3) the skull geometry is significantly different between the Rhesus and cadaver at the impact site, and 4) the differences in the external muscle mass at the impact site affect the interaction of the skull with the load cell. KINEMATIC RESPONSE AFTER IMPACT: EFFECT OF SOFT TISSUE - Transmission of energy during intervals Q1~Q2 and ^2~^3 waS analYzed comparing the acceleration response of the skull to the force-time history of the impactor. The following observations were made. During the Qļ~Q2 interval, energy was transferred from the impactor to the skull and from the skull to the brain and neck. During the Q2~Q3 interval, significant energy was transferred from the brain and neck to the skull. Examination of all the tests shows that during the Q2~Q3 interval, unless there were rapid changes in the binormal vector direction (large torsion and large B- rate), the normal acceleration is established by angular acceleration. In addition, the normal and binormal vectors are established first by the angular acceleration during the Q?~®3 interval and then by the angular acceleration and angular velocity after the Q event. In general, for those tests with multimodal/ unimodal peaks, the angular acceleration direction changes near the Q. event. The extent and amount of rotation changes from test to test. This is probably a result of complex three-dimensional motion of the head during the Qļ-Q2 interval as well as of the geometry of the head and skull. The rotation tends to be between jí/2 and jí radians. The motion past the event for multimodal tangential acceleration tests is similar to the unimodal tangential acceleration tests. In other words, the trajectory traced by the "estimated Fig. 12. Mechanical Impedance Corridor of Impact Force and Tangential Accelerations for Tests 82E021, 82E022, 82E041, 82E042, and 84E141.</page><page sequence="21">6.820 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. Fig. 13. Mechanical Impedances of Impact Force and Tangential Acceleration for Tests 84E161A and 84E161B. anatomical center" and its attached frame field during multimodal tangential acceleration impacts is different from that traced during unimodal tangential acceleration impacts. However , the motion after impact is similar and the driving force is obviously other than the impactor. In past research (40) it has been determined that in the unpressurized or partially repressurized cadaver the response of the skull after impact is influenced by differential motion of the brain. In a similar manner, in the data presented here it seems that the brain is driving the skull and that this is manifested in both a linear and rotational manner. Potentially, energy has been transferred from the skull to the brain during impact, was stored as energy and then was released as the impact force dropped below a given level . PRESSURE TIME HISTORY RESPONSE - The pressure time histories for repressurized cadavers were separated into two significant types, unimodal and bimodal. The unimodal pressure pulses correlate well with short- duration (less than 15 ms) large-valued (1500 m/ s/s) tangential accelerations. Bimodal pressure pulses were more commonly observed in longer</page><page sequence="22">6.821 HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE Fig. 14. Comparison of Right and Left Parietal Pressures and Comparison of Right Parietal Pressures for Different Impacts.</page><page sequence="23">6.822 G. S. NUSHOLTZ, ET AL* Fig. 15. Transfer Function Corridor of Frontal and Right Parietal Epidural Pressures for Tests 82E021 , 82E022, 82E041, 82E042, and 84E141. duration and lower acceleration impacts. This result seems to be a consequence of the superposition of two different types of mechanisms for producing pressure changes in the head during and after blunt impact. The first pressure mechanism is associated with impact force time histories which contain sufficient high-frequency components to excite a short-duration loading of the skull on the brain, and probably is primarily a result of inertial loading. When a blunt impact blow is delivered to the head, the skull is initially accelerated. Shortly afterwards the brain compresses on the side closest to impact and is in tension on the side polar ly distal to impact. The result is a pressure gradient in the brain going from point of impact to an area opposite from impact. Test 82E021 in the appendix illustrates such pressures for selected impacts and shows that highest magnitudes and positive pressures occur in the frontal lobe (epidural 1) and that negative pressures develop in the occipital lobe (epidural 3). Pressures in the parietal areas (epidural 2, epidural 4) are between the coup and counter coup areas. The pressures in epidural 2 and epidural 4, for most of these repressurized cadaver tests, correlated well indicating that the pressure gradients were, in general, symmetric. However, some differences do exist which may be the result of three-dimensional motion of the head or of some asymmetry associated with the test subject. Figure 14 illustrates a cross- and auto- correlation between epidural 2 and epidural 4 for Tests 82E021 and 82E061 and shows that the auto-correlation for each pressure is similar to the cross-correlation. This is similar to results reported by others (42-43). Figure 15 represents transfer functions between the force and the epidural 1 and 2 pressures for Tests 82E021, 82E022, 82E041 and 82E042 in which skull deformation occurred in the absence of skull fracture. These transfer functions have a possible resonance in the area</page><page sequence="24">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.823 for which a resonance was predicted from the impedance transfer function for force and acceleration. This indicates that although the exact amount of the effect of skull deformation on the pressure response is not completely determined, it has some effect which is observable in the pressure time history. Therefore, a reasonable correlation might be found between pressure and acceleration. However, such a correlation would depend on where the accelerometers are placed on the skull. The second pressure mechanism is associated with impact force time histories which contain low-frequency components or motion of the head after blunt impact. Unlike the first pressure mechanism which rarely produces pressure pulses longer than 15 ms, the second pressure mechanism produces pressure pulses that can last as long as 200 ms. Possibly, the second pressure mechanism is a result of the brain driving the skull as discussed earlier. Since the pressure is positive in all transducers regardless of position, the brain is possibly transferring energy to the skull, thus, accelerating it. This is consistent with the results discussed earlier where the brain stores energy and releases it shortly afterwards in a way that is manifested by skull angular acceleration. The results obtained from the high-speed cineradiograph support this hypothesis. Figure 16 is two frames from 16 mm high-speed cineradiograph movies of Test 84E161 showing the outline of the radio-opaque gel target injected into the brain tissue and ventricles. Inspection of the curves traced out by the gel from the pressure transducers to the ventricles, shows that although no motion could be detected between the skull and the brain, differential motion of parts of the brain was occurring. All the pressure time histories for Rhesus subjects were unimodal and of short duration. This may be the result of the greater tangential acceleration which was associated with Rhesus impacts as compared to cadaver ones, or it may be the result of the differences between the response of the repressurized cadaver and that of the live unpressurized post-mortem Rhesus. Although there are a limited number of tests in this study, comparisons with pressure time histories from tests reported earlier not having skull fracture (30) indicate that there is a difference in response between those tests and the ones being reported here. Possibly, this is a result of the pressure-volume changes which accompany skull deformation that become acute during basilar skull fracture. The feature of the data that seems to indicate that this is true, is that near the Q- event the pressure becomes negative faster and obtains a greater negative maximum. Test 79A249, for example, reaches a negative maximum of about one atmosphere and maintains this for approximately 2 ms. In the appendix, Test 78A241 (non-skull fracture) and Tests 79A249 and 79A251 (skull fracture) illustrate this contrast. In addition, the high-speed cineradiographic film recorded a radio-transparent region forming at the top of the skull for Test 79A253 (Figure 17) indicating that the skull in the area of the pressure transducer had moved completely away from the brain. In previous work (40), there Fig. 16.

NUSHOLTZ, ET AL. was a significant difference in response between live and unpressurized post-mortem Rhesus; however, in this study when complex skull fracture occurred, it seems that skull deformation obscurred determination of whether there was such a difference between live, unpressurized post-mortem Rhesus. INJURY/DAMAGE RESPONSE - The results presented in Tables 6,7 and 8 show that the most common brain in jury/damage in the Rhesus and Fig. 17. Radiograph of Test 79A253.</page><page sequence="26">HEAD IMPACT RESPONSE 6.825 repressurized cadaver is subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the live Rhesus, the injury tends to be in the area at the base of the brain near the cerebellum, pons and midbrain. In the post-mortem Rhesus, no brain damage was observed except damage associated with the skull impinging upon the soft tissue of the brain during skull fracture. In particular, Test 79A256 was the only Rhesus test with this type of damage to the brain: the skull was thin enough so that fracture resulted to a much greater degree than for any other test. Damage occurs for repressurized cadavers in the frontal or parietal lobes of the cerebrum. Despite the different types of surrogates for humans in these series, the different initial test conditions, and the different injury locations, subarachnoid hemorrhage did not occur unless "significant skull deformation" was present. Except for Test 79A251, no subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed in the absence of skull deformation. Identifying mechanisms of head injury poses a formidable problem. In head impact response a number of potential injury mechanisms have been proposed (5-43). It is believed that different mechanisms occur for direct head impact than for non-impact (inertial conditions). It is also possible that several mechanisms could be responsible for producing the same injury/ damage. The complex nature of the head/ skull system under loading implies that under any given impact several mechanisms could be occurring and that they may complement each other to produce injury/damage. One possible mechanism for production of subarachnoid hemorrhage in both the repressurized cadaver and the live Rhesus human surrogates is induced differential motion between the skull-brain interface. Potentially, there are two types of differential motion of the skull with respect to the brain. One is associated with "local" movement of the skull differentially with respect to the brain. The second requires rotational differential motion of a "significantly large" section of the skull with respect to the brain. In Tests 84E161A and 84E161B the high-speed cineradiograph films show changes in the radiopaque target area that formed curves extending from the pressure transducers to the lateral ventricle, which clearly indicate internal movement of the brain. However, no movement of the skull with respect to the brain was concurrently observed. Yet, in Test 84E151 both skull fracture and differential movement of the brain with the skull of up to 6 mm was observed. This potentially indicates that a "stick-slip" condition occurs, and that a "significant local acceleration" of any part of the skull can initiate differential motion of the brain surface with respect to the skull. However, because only a limited number of tests have been performed using techniques which make such observations possible, more work needs to be done before this hypothesis can be verified. In repressurized cadaver tests, comparatively large pressure peaks were observed. It is possible that in those tests, high stress in the brain as well as skull deformations and angular accelerations were needed to produce the observed damage. In several tests, duplicate impacts were made to each subject. It is possible that this enhanced the damage response; and therefore the results presented here should not be used to set tolerance levels. However, it is believed that this did not affect the general trend of damage and/or injury response observed. CONCLUSIONS This was a limited study of some important kinematic factors and injury/damage modes associated with direct blunt head impact. Because of the complex nature of the skull-brain interaction during an impact event, more work is necessary before these kinematic factors can be generalized to describe head impact response. However, the following conclusions can be made: 1. "Severe impacts" to the heads of repressurized cadavers can cause local motions in the skull with or without skull fracture. The motions are interpreted as angular acceleration by nine accelerometers mounted in a single array used to determine three- dimensional motion. 2. In repressurized cadavers and live Rhesus subjects skull deformation may cause direct and/or indirect subarachnoid hemorrhage . 3. For live Rhesus subjects, negative pressure peaks during an impact event equal to or greater than one atmosphere do not appear to produce injury. 4. Three-dimensional rigid body motion is not well defined in a "severe head impact" when using accelerometers located on the skull. The acceleration time histories, including the resultant acceleration used to calculate the Head Injury Criterion (HIC), of the anatomical center, depends not only on where the accelerometers have been placed on the skull but also on the biovariability of the test subject's skull . 5. Short duration impacts (less than 15 ms) in the anterior to posterior direction appear to involve two skull- brain interactions. One occurs during impact and is characterized by a transfer of energy from the skull to the brain and a pressure gradient in the brain positive at the frontal bone and negative at the occipital bone. The second interaction occurs during and after impact and is characterized by energy transmission from the brain to the skull and positive pressure in the brain at the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones.</page><page sequence="27">6.826 G.
