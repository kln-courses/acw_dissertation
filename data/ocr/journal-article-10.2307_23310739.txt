NOVIKOFF The scholastic debates of medieval authors have not fared well among historians. As a subject, they are treated seriously by philosophers and theologians interested in particular points of logic or doctrine, selectively by specialists of medieval learning who focus on particular authors or key ideas, and hardly at all by historians con cerned with the wider cultural fabric of medieval society. Popular images of scho lastic argumentation have only isolated the field further. From Renaissance human ists and luminaries in the age of reason to general assumptions today, these debates have routinely been condemned as medieval vestiges of an anti-intellectual world: pedantic at best, pointless at worst.1 Faced on the one hand with the pejorative connotations of "scholastic" and "quodlibet," we are on the other hand endlessly entreated these days to enter into "dialogue" with others, a discourse that both re flects and presupposes a post-Enlightenment (perhaps even postmodern) engage ment with the world.2 Marginalized and misunderstood, the history of medieval di alogue and debate is in need of a fresh assessment. A preliminary version of this article was delivered as a paper in February 2008 at the Mellon-Sawyer Seminar on Disputation at UCLA's Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. I am grateful to the organizers, Brian Copenhaver and Calvin Normore, for the invitation to speak and to the participants for their feedback. I especially thank Daniel Hobbins, James J. Murphy, Benjamin Nathans, Albert B. Novikoff, Thomas B. Payne, Edward Roesner, Jennifer Saltzstein, and my wonderful colleagues in the Rhodes History Department's "Historians at Work" seminar. For advice and encouragement in my earliest research on this topic, 1 thank Edward Peters, Rita Copeland, E. Ann Matter, Anna Sapir Abulafia, Roger Chartier, and Anthony Grafton. My deepest gratitude is offered to the six anonymous reviewers for the. AHR for their critical and constructive insights, and to the editors of the journal, who handled this article with such care and judiciousness: Konstantin Dierks, Sarah Knott, Jane Lyle, and especially Robert Schneider. I wish to recognize the generous support of the Rhodes College History Department in helping to cover the cost of the images. 1 Many authors of the Middle Ages criticized or satirized the logic of the schools and universities, but it was the humanists of the Italian Renaissance who were among the first to associate scholasticism with a distinctly medieval and backward-looking outlook, a view that has persisted ever since. The image passed down in the English-speaking world is well summed up by John Locke, Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), bk. Ill, chap. 10, para. 9: "For, notwithstanding these learned disputants, these all-knowing doctors, it was to the unscholastic statesman that the governments of the world owed their peace, defence, and liberties .. . Nevertheless, this artificial ignorance, and learned gibberish, prevailed mightily in these last ages, by the interest and artifice of those who found no easier way to that pitch of authority and dominion they have attained, than by amusing the men of business, and ignorant, with hard words, or employing the ingenious and idle in intricate disputes about unintelligible terms, and holding them perpetually entangled in that endless labyrinth." The parody of scholastic debate finds its most familiar caricature in the proverbial question of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, a satire on medieval angelology (and scholasticism in general) that likewise seems to be early modern in origin. 2 "Dialogue" and "dialogic" are buzzwords in many corners of modern political and intellectual discourse. In his influential, and difficult to characterize, collection of essays The Dialogic Imagination, 331</page><page sequence="3">Ü2 Alex J. Novikojj Serious challenges remain to understanding the place of scholasticism in the broader culture of the High Middle Ages. A particular challenge is posed by the origins and development of disputation, the formalized debate techniques of the medieval university, whose existence is always assumed but whose impact beyond the academic environment has not been adequately explored. As a leading scholar of medieval rhetoric has put it, "the scholastic emphasis upon thesis, counterthesis, and listing of arguments must have had its effects on all kinds of discourse. It would be difficult to name a more pervasive influence with so little study given to its effect."3 An especially vexed question is the relationship between the dialogue genre, a pop ular literary form in the twelfth century, and the dialectical methods of scholastic disputation. Giles Constable has stated the problem thus: "Dialogue and dialectic— the science of doubt as it has been called—played a fundamental part in the thought processes of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. It underlay the discipline of dis putation that developed in the schools and was applied to almost every branch of intellectual inquiry."4 Curiously, no scholar has yet pursued the history of dialogue and disputation along these other branches—what we might call their cultural his tory. The centrality of scholastic disputation to medieval learning has never been doubted; the problem in charting its history is where to begin and in what direction to proceed. To date, the topic has more commonly been treated as a subsidiary and finite category of medieval logic in connection with individual authors or schools. Identifying disputation as a historical problem raises a fundamental question: Can the scholastic argumentation embodied in these dialogues and disputations (real or literary) shed light on deeper cultural mutations within medieval civilization? The answer, it seems, is yes. Scholastic disputation arose in the late eleventh century in connection with new developments in monastic learning, and over the course of the next two centuries, it developed systematically and centrifugally from France and Italy to become a formative practice in the scholastic culture of medieval Europe, eventually transcending the frontier between private and public spheres and extend ing to multiple levels of society. Not only was the triumph of disputation one of the signal achievements of the medieval university curriculum, but its evolution and ap plication beyond the confines of strictly academic circles (in debate poems and poly phonic music, and more particularly in the Christian confrontation with Jews and Judaism) suggests that the rise of medieval disputation can offer historians an in structive model of cultural history: specifically, it illustrates how dialogue escaped its literary origin and passed from an idea among few to a cultural practice among many. The term "cultural history" is as elusive as it is seductive. Frequently invoked but rarely defined, cultural history in the early modern period is often identified with a combination of anthropological and historical approaches to understanding popular trans. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist (Austin, Tex., 1981), literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin saw an important linguistic and semiotic shift in the rise of the "dialogical" novel of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which he contrasted with the ancient epic.

What has not been pursued in any great detail is the evolution and diffusion of that most scholastic method itself—dispu tation—especially its extension into other, related spheres of cultural activity that did not immediately depend on the schools in which it first developed. An important exception is Erwin Panofsky's short but provocative Gothic Architecture and Scho lasticism (1951), which attempted to correlate the ordered and harmonious spaces of thirteenth-century cathedrals to the organizational structure of scholastic thought.7 A comparative model of a different sort led another scholar to suggest that elements of the scholastic method of the twelfth century were influenced by earlier Islamic colleges, which also gave prominence to a pro and contra form of argumen tation.8 Evoking loose parallels between thought and architecture or between two different cultural traditions is one thing; tracing the organic evolution of an essential mode of analysis in a single culture is quite another. A new approach to scholastic learning is needed. Studies of the medieval mind or the medieval "imagination" have been under taken before, and in their most successful forms they have greatly enriched our un derstanding of medieval society by expanding intellectual and theological concepts into more culturally relevant categories.9 In the case of disputation, however, one 5 As just one example of the plurality ot definitions ottered, see Peter Burke, Varieties of Cultural History (Ithaca, N.Y., 1997). For an attempt at a cultural history of medieval France, see Michel Sot, Jean-Patrice Boudet, and Anita Guerreau-Jalabert, Le Moyen âge (Paris, 1997), where disputation is mentioned in passing (e.g., 127, 145, 176) but not discussed at any length. 6 See Peter Burke, "Strengths and Weaknesses of the History of Mentalities," in Burke, Varieties of Cultural History, 162-182, here 163.

Novikojj of the stumbling blocks to appreciating its cultural dimension is the tendency to freeze it in a moment in time rather than observe its evolution. Individual practi tioners and instances of disputation have been studied, but rarely has there been a sustained consideration of the practice itself.10 In order to uncover the formation of this essential habit of medieval culture, a more profitable approach will be to trace the development of disputation on the frontiers between private and public spheres and between learned and popular audiences. The crossing of these frontiers can best be observed when disciplinary boundaries are blurred and disputation is examined longitudinally across both time and place—the longue durée, to borrow a term from the economic historians of the Annales school. Our goal, therefore, is to illustrate how an idea and a literary form originally limited to small intellectual circles in the late eleventh century evolved though multiple stages to become a cultural practice within the larger public sphere in the thirteenth.11 It is in this sense that the study of scholastic disputation, long confined to technical discussions among specialists, offers historians a useful paradigm of cultural history. "old-style intellectual history." See Bynum, The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200-1336 (New York, 1995), xvi, and Wonderful Blood: Theology and Practice in Late Medieval Northern Germany and Beyond (Philadelphia, 2007), xv-xviii. More recently, see the exemplary study by Daniel Hobbins, Authorship and Publicity before Print: Jean Gerson and the Transformation of Late Medieval Learning (Philadelphia, 2009). A sociological approach to medieval thought is D. L. D'Avray, Medieval Religious Rationalities: A Weberian Analysis (Cambridge, 2010). 10 When disputation is singled out for study, it is almost always in the context of the university curriculum, and with scant regard for pre-university or extra-university manifestations. Cf. Olga Weijers, La "Disputatio" à la Faculté des arts de Paris (1200-1350 environ): Esquisse d'une typologie (Turnhout, 1995); and Bernardo C. Bazàn, John W. Wippel, Gérard Fransen, and Danielle Jacquart, eds., Les questions disputées et les questions quodlibétiques dans les facultés de théologie, de droit, et de médecine (Turnhout, 1985). For the use of disputation among individual scholastic authors, see the learned studies by Marcia L. Colish, Peter Lombard, 2 vols. (Leiden, 1994); and John W. Baldwin, Masters, Princes, and Merchants: The Social Views of Peter the Chanter and His Circle, 2 vols. (Princeton, N.J., 1970). For case studies of individual poets and philosophers of the later Middle Ages, see Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, and Richard Utz, eds., Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate (Eugene, Ore., 2002). A detailed analysis of a famous thirteenth-century Jewish-Christian disputation is Robert Chazan, Barcelona and Beyond: The Disputation of 1263 and Its Aftermath (Berkeley, Calif., 1992). 11 The term "public sphere" is admittedly something of a hornet's nest in modern historiography. Jürgen Habermas noted that his concept of a "bourgeois public sphere" in the eighteenth century did not apply to medieval Europe; Habermas, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society, trans. Thomas Burger (Cambridge, Mass., 1989; original German ed. 1962), 5-12. Medievalists, however, have rightly challenged the presumption that no public sphere at all existed in the Middle Ages. In fact, Habermas's public sphere was largely based on a caricature of the Middle Ages, not unlike the caricatures of scholastic debates cited above. Recent discussions of premodern publicity range widely, from the symbolic rituals of early medieval assembly politics to late medieval marketplaces, public intellectuals, and legal culture. 1 employ the term "public sphere" to point to a division between the more cloistered and literary world of monastic learning in the eleventh century and the more public, and indeed performative, sphere of university and extra-university debates in the thirteenth century, as will become clear below. On the semantic difficulties involved in discussing the concepts of "private" and "public" in the Middle Ages, see Peter von Moos, "Öffentlich" und "privat" im Mittelalter: Zu einem Problem historischer Begriffsbildung (Heidelberg, 2004); and Shannon McShef frey, "Place, Space, and Situation: Public and Private in the Making of Marriage in Late-Medieval Lon don," Speculum 79, no. 4 (2004): 960-990. For another attempt at locating a public sphere in the thir teenth century, see the remarkable study by Carol Symes, A Common Stage: Theater and Public Life in Medieval Arras (Ithaca, N.Y., 2007). A more radical application of Habermas's concept is Leidulf Melve, Inventing the Public Sphere: The Public Debate during the Investiture Conflict (c. 1030-1122), 2 vols. (Lei den, 2007), who advances the curious argument that a public sphere existed in the predominantly textual context of the eleventh-century controversy over Investiture but that it then did not reappear until after the Middle Ages.

In the legal courts of late Republican Rome, Cicero perfected an art of discourse in utramque partem (on both sides of the issue) that became a basic element in clas sical rhetoric. In his dialogues, Cicero introduced Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary that allowed him to follow the Socratic method by raising doubts about the plausibility of some of the most important ideas of the day.14 Both before and immediately after the rise of Christianity as a state religion, the social competition of public disputation formed an integral part of Roman culture.15 Early Christians adopted the rhetoric of debate for their own purposes. The New Testament describes Jesus disputing with the elders (Luke 2: 46-47) and Paul disputing with the Jews (Acts 17-18), motifs that would become especially popular in later medieval and Renaissance iconography. In late antiquity, the merging of classical learning and Christianity produced another cul tural turn in dialogue and disputation: Augustine introduced in his Soliloquia and other writings a meditative inner dialogue with himself, while continuing to dispute publicly with heretics, and Boethius provided in his celebrated dialogue Consolation of Philosophy and other theological works a point of departure for the medieval harmony between faith and philosophy.16 In the centuries after the fall of Rome, 12 The roles of reason and debate are currently being rethought from the perspective of the cognitive sciences. A recent, and controversial, theory holds that human reason evolved for the purpose of winning arguments in the debating arena. See the positions for and against this theory in Behavioral and Brain Sciences 34, no. 2 (April 2011): 57-111. For a précis of this theory, see Patricia Cohen, "Reason Seen More as Weapon Than Path to Truth," New York Times, June 14, 2011. For ancient models of literary debate, see G. J. Reinink and H. L. J. Vanstiphout, eds., Dispute Poems and Dialogue in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East: Forms and Types of Literary Debates in Semitic and Related Literatures (Leuven, 1991). 13 On Plato's use of dialogue, see Charles H. Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form (Cambridge, 1996); and Kenneth M. Sayre, Plato's Literary Garden: How to Read a Platonic Dialogue (Notre Dame, Ind., 1995). For a convergence of philosophical ideas and music similar to what is attempted in this article, see J. B. Kennedy, The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues (Dur ham, N.C., 2011). 14 See Robert Gorman, The Socratic Method in the Dialogues of Cicero (Wiesbaden, 2005). Cicero's dialogues, in particular, circulated widely because the early Church declared him a "virtuous pagan," and consequently many of his works were deemed worthy of preservation. Indeed, more works survived in the Middle Ages by Cicero than by any other Latin author. See John C. Rolfe, Cicero and His Influence (London, 1923); and Ettore Paratore, "Cicerone attraverso i secoli," in Luigi Alfonsi et al., Marco Tullio Cicerone (Florence, 1961), 237-244, for indications of their medieval manuscript tradition. Cicero's moral philosophy proved especially influential in the twelfth century. See, for instance, the following studies by Philippe Delhaye: "La place de l'éthique parmi les disciplines scientifiques au XIIe siècle," in Miscellanea moralia in honorem eximii domini Arthur Janssen, universitatis catholicae in oppido lovani ensi professons, 2 vols.

Novikofj where scholars have begun to highlight the role of Christianity in this so-called ' end of dialogue," Augustine and Boethius served as models for the medieval continuity of dialogue in a monastic and contemplative setting.17 This master narrative of the decline of literary dialogue and public disputation has been especially attractive to scholars of the Renaissance, who have repeatedly minimized the role of both during the Middle Ages, all while accentuating the "culture of dialogue" or "culture of debate" that humanism allegedly rediscovered.18 Like the abusive stereotypes of scholastic thought, this assumption correspondingly calls for revision. 2.35.48 he explicitly acknowledges the usefulness of dialectic (disputandi disciplina) for all the kinds of problems that must be investigated and resolved in sacred scripture. In Soliloquia 2.7.14 he never uses the word "dialectic," but he does refer to the discipline in one of its meanings when he writes that there is no better way of searching for truth than by questioning and answering. He then raises the question whether the art of disputation (ars disputandi ) is true or false, and he answers that it is true.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW \pril 2012</page><page sequence="8">Toward a Cultural History of Scholastic Disputation 337 The turn of the twelfth century has long been identified with new beginnings in the intellectual and cultural landscape of Europe.19 The growth of cities and centers of learning, the migration of students into France, a renewed interest in dialectic, and the recovery of ancient law texts are all familiar components of what is commonly referred to as the "twelfth-century renaissance."20 The Italian-born monk Anselm of Bee (1033-1109) occupies a central place on this new horizon of learning. Best known for his ontological proof of the existence of God, Anselm experimented early in his career with a more pedagogically engaging method of instruction at his mon astery in Normandy (Bee). It was his pioneering use of dialogue and disputation in the company of his students that initiated the emergence of a culture of disputation.21 Anselm's first substantial work, the Monologion (ca. 1077), reflects a close reading of Augustine's De trinitate.22 Anselm described his work as a meditatio on the divine being, but by "meditation" he specifically meant the inner dialogue and deliberation that was characteristic of Augustine's spirituality. Some of Anselm's brothers per sisted in asking him to give them an example of meditation, "by writing down some thoughts on the divine essence and other related matters, which I have communi cated to them in my regular discussions [colloquia]." The discussions must have been fairly open engagements, for it was the leading questions that drew out of Anselm a new approach to teaching and learning. "They asked that whatever conclusion was reached in the course of each investigation should be expressed in plain language with intelligible arguments and simple disputation [simplicique disputatione], so that the necessary conclusions and clear truth of the matter would be clearly expressed."23 These opening words in the prologue to the Monologion point to what would quickly become a recurring feature of Anselm's method of inquiry: dialogue and disputation. 19 For recent assessments, see Thomas F. X. Noble and John Van Engen, eds., European Trans formations: The Long Twelfth Century (Notre Dame, Ind., 2012). 20 The phrase "renaissance of the twelfth century" owes its popular success, but not its initial con ception, to Charles Homer Haskins's 1927 book of the same title. For the pre-Haskins origins of the term and the development of the concept, see Alex J. Novikoff, "The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century before Haskins," Haskins Society Journal 16 (2005): 104-116. On developments since Haskins's influ ential book, see Marcia L. Colish, "Haskins' Renaissance Seventy Years Later: Beyond Anti-Burck hardtianism," Haskins Society Journal 11 (2003): 1-15. The applicability of the term has long been ques tioned. For a recent critique, see C. Stephen Jaeger, "Pessimism in the Twelfth-Century 'Renaissance,' " Speculum 78, no. 4 (October 2003): 1151-1183. 21 I explore this element of the culture of disputation in detail in Alex J. Novikoff, "Anselm, Di alogue, and the Rise of Scholastic Disputation," Speculum 86, no. 2 (2011): 387-418. The paragraphs that follow recapitulate those arguments in order to set up the later cultural history of disputation that constitutes the focus of this article. For insights into other elements of monastic learning in the age of Anselm, see Sally N. Vaughn and Jay Rubenstein, eds., Teaching and Learning in Northern Europe, 1000-1200 (Turnhout, 2006); and most recently, Steven Vanderputten, ed..

Southern, Saint Anselm: A Portrait in a Landscape (Cambridge, 1990). A diverse appraisal of Anselm's significance for the modern world is offered in Coloman Viola and Frederick Van Fleteren, eds., Saint Anselm, a Thinker for Yesterday and Today: Anselm's Thought Viewed by Our Contemporaries (Lewiston, N.Y., 2002). Still very useful because of the range of historical themes touched upon are the proceedings from the 1982 Anselm conference held at Bee: Raymonde Foreville, ed., Les mutations socio-culturelles au tournant des XIe-XIIe siècles (Paris, 1984). 22 The various stages that Anselm went through to "publish" his works have been addressed in a meticulous study by Richard Sharpe, "Anselm as Author: Publishing in the Late Eleventh Century," Journal of Medieval Latin 19 (2009): 1-87. 23 Anselm of Canterbury, Monologion, in S.

Novikofj This path to knowledge, along with an unprecedented commitment to demonstrating Christian truth by reason alone (sola ratione), was the critical element in his ped agogical innovations at his school at Bee.24 He later explained his simultaneous re liance upon, and departure from, Augustine along similar lines in a letter to his mentor Lanfranc: "it was my intention throughout the whole of this disputation [dis putationem] to assert nothing that could not be immediately defended either from canonical writers or from the words of St. Augustine."25 Even a work cast in the form of a meditation was, for Anselm as it was for Augustine, a dialogue with oneself. All reflections on the matter of the divine being, even if originally stimulated by a reading of Augustine, were the result of an inner dialogue. In much the same way that he was committed to proving Christian doctrine sola ratione, without recourse to scrip ture, Anselm was venturing to demonstrate most of his propositions by means of inner disputation alone. Anselm's method of teaching, as far as it can be reconstructed from his writings and those who knew him, was to hold a Socratic form of debate with the monks, in which the participants argued out the issues. Clues to his pedagogy come from his theological and philosophical works that are cast in the form of a dialogue between master and pupil.26 To be sure, the dialogue genre extends back to antiquity, and it was effectively used by Lanfranc and others, but over his career, Anselm went on to write more dialogues than any other Latin Christian author since Augustine.27 No fewer than seven of his works take the literary form of a dialogue, and there are several others that are attributed to him but are of dubious authenticity. De gram matico is likely the earliest of these dialogues and concerns not grammar in the sense that the title implies, but paronymy (the semantics involved when the same noun signifies more than one thing) and the section in Aristotle's Categories that deals with substance.28 Like his later works, De grammatico is not overtly confrontational. The discussion about Aristotle's syllogisms comes to a close when the teacher in the dialogue applauds the student's progress but warns him against the power wielded 24 The novelty of Anselm's reliance on reason as an aid to faith has been much commented upon by historians, theologians, and philosophers alike. For a fresh assessment, see Marilyn McCord Adams, "Anselm on Faith and Reason," in Brian Davies and Brian Leftow, eds., The Cambridge Companion to Anselm (Cam bridge, 2004), 32-60. See also Eileen C. Sweeney, "Rewriting the Narrative of Scripture: 12th-Century De bates over Reason and Theological Form," Medieval Philosophy and Theology 3 (1993): 1-34. 25 Anselm, Epístola 77, in Opera omnia, 3: 199-200. 26 This point has been observed before, but never truly explored. See the remarks by Richard Campbell, "The Systematic Character of Anselm's Thought," in Foreville, Les mutations socio-culturelles au tournant des XIe-XIIe siècles, 549-560, here 553-554: "What I find striking about Anselm's arguments, whether in the more philosophical works or in the more theological, is the way they always proceed within the context of what someone says ... In the dialogue form adopted in many of the later works all of the statements are, of course, owned by one or [anjother of the participants . .. Anselm is not indulging in idle speculation or intellectual games; he will only consider propositions which are 'owned' by one speaker." 27 The foundational study of the dialogue genre is Rudolf Hirzel, Der Dialog: Ein literarhistorischer Ver such, 2 vols. (Leipzig, 1895). A recent compendium of medieval Latin dialogues has highlighted the genre's popularity for later centuries, but curiously ignores its resurgence in the twelfth century: Carmen Cardelle de Hartmann, Lateinische Dialoge, 1200-1400: Literaturhistorische Studie und Repertorium (Leiden, 2007). See also the studies of individual authors in Klaus Jacobi, ed., Gespräche lesen: Philosophische Dialoge im Mittelalter (Tübingen, 1999), with an essay devoted to Anselm by Eileen Sweeney, 101-124. 28 The authoritative commentary on this early work is Desmond Paul Henry, Commentary on "De grammatico": The Historical-Logical Dimensions of a Dialogue of St. Anselm's (Dordrecht, 1974). The dating of this dialogue is a matter of some conjecture. The dates proposed are as early as 1060-1063 (after R. W. Southern, which I prefer) and as late as 1080-1085. See the discussion by Sharpe, "Anselm as Author," 22, who favors a dating of around 1080 "or a little later."

Even if the aspiring student should be outdone by weightier arguments, "you would not deny that at least our disputing [disputandi nobis] has benefited us in the practice of argumentation."29 The very framing of the work in dicates that Anselm's dialogues, in their form as well as their content, served as a window onto the current issues that engaged him in discussions with his students. The effects of this learning on the intellectual atmosphere at Bee so impressed the ecclesiastical historian Orderic Vitalis that he described with amazement Anselm's ability to produce a climate of learning in which the monks were "so eager to solve theological problems and compose edifying treatises, that almost all of them seem to be philosophers."30 Both Orderic and Anselm's biographer Eadmer stressed the diversity of the students, clerics, and laymen who came to sit at the feet of the re nowned teacher.31 Thus the dialogical procedure that characterizes Anselm's school not only reflects the pedagogical activities that took shape at Bee, it is what attracted them there in the first place. In the corpus of his writings, Anselm uses the verb disputare and its accompanying noun forms on more than forty separate occasions.32 While the meaning of this term 29 Anselm, De grammatico, in Opera omnia, 1: 168. 30 Orderic Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, 6 vols., ed. and trans.

Nov i kojj might vary from a simple discussion or conversation to a more intense dispute or "debate," there is a clear parallel between the form of his writings and the vo cabulary he employs. From his earliest meditation to his last letters, with several real debates in between, he consistently refers to his rational investigations and dialec tical argumentation in terms of a disputado, and his dialogues bear the imprint of this approach. hrom the circle of Anselm and his students, the dialogue rapidly emerged as a literary, pedagogical, and indeed polemical genre of choice for authors of the twelfth century. Fewer than ten dialogues can be counted in the century prior to Anselm's writings at Bee (the 1060s), but more than eighty exist from his time to the close of the twelfth century. The authors of these dialogues and disputations are among the most important writers and thinkers of the twelfth century: Odo of Tournai, Rupert of Deutz, Hugh of St. Victor, Anselm of Havelberg, Aelred of Rievaulx, Adelard of Bath, Peter Alfonsi, Peter Abelard, Walter of Châtillon, Andreas Capellanus, and many others, including several anonymous authors and known students of Anselm. The sheer quantity of dialogues written in the generations following Anselm and his circle reflects the success of new methods of writing and argumentation—the scho lastic method, so called because of its association with the schools of the late eleventh and the twelfth century.33 In one sense these figures are hardly surprising, since alongside the resurgence in dialogues there can, and should, be placed a concomitant growth in a number of other literary enterprises, such as the writing of letters, poetry, commentaries and glosses, sentences, and even history.34 Yet in contrast to these other genres, whose purposes and audience are often more explicit or apparent, there is no immediate explanation for the sudden popularity of the dialogue form in the last quarter of the eleventh century and throughout the twelfth.35 No ars dialogi as such existed in the Middle Ages comparable to the ars dictaminis or the ars po ética,36 Most of Plato's dialogues remained untranslated until the fifteenth century. 33 The foundational study of the scholastic method is Martin Grabmann, Die Geschichte der Scho lastischen Methode: Nach den gedruckten und ungedruckten Quellen dargestellt, 2 vols. (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1909-1911), who adopts the broadest possible scope and examines authors from late antiquity until the beginning of the thirteenth century. Important themes related to scholastic thought are dis cussed in the various essays in Norman Kretzmann, Anthony Kenny, and Jan Pinborg, eds.. The Cam bridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy: From the Rediscovery of Aristotle to the Disintegration of Scholasticism, 1100-1600 (Cambridge, 1982). Many philosophical and theological elements of early scholasticism are explored in an excellent recent collection of essays by leading scholars in the field: Irène Rosier-Catach, ed., Arts du langage et théologie aux confins des XI''-XIIe siècles: Textes, maîtres, débats (Turnhout, 2011). 34 Brian Stock, in discussing the cosmological interests of twelfth-century authors, writes that "a great many literary forms from the classical and, in particular, the late Latin world were revived for the purpose: the dialogue, the satura (orprosimetrum), the encyclopedia, the commentary, and, more rarely, the epic and the myth itself. The forms were utilized in ways that often emphasized their distance from antiquity and their relation to literary fashions in their own day." Stock, Myth and Science in the Twelfth Century: A Study of Bernard Silvester (Princeton, N.J., 1972), 30. 35 Cf. Constable, The Reformation of the Twelfth Century, 128: "one of the most striking examples of the influence of rhetoric on the forms of religious literature in the eleventh and twelfth centuries was the popularity of debates, dialogues, and disputes, or, as they were sometimes called, the altercado or conflictus." 36 But see von Moos, "Literatur- und bildungsgeschichtliche Aspekte der Dialogform im lateinis chen Mittelalter," who says that "a new culture of problematizing dialogue" tended to replace the com mentary in the late twelfth century (199). In his investigation of Everard of Ypres ("Le dialogue latin au Moyen âge"), von Moos takes up the question of the ars dialogica, but it still stands that there was no formalized manner for writing dialogues. Ronquist, "Learning and Teaching in Twelfth-Century American Historical Review \pril 2012</page><page sequence="12">Toward a Cultural History of Scholastic Disputation 341 What did develop and was eventually formalized in the schools of the twelfth century was the practice, and later theory, of disputation.37 In the generation following An selm, the medieval disputatio would be taken up in Italy and northern France and become central to the new scholastic milieu. In the first half of the twelfth century, theologians, scientists, and lawyers all turned to the dialogue for effective instruction. While certain patterns in the form and function of the dialogue genre remained, new developments in the practice of debate also emerged. The theological nature of the dialogues of Anselm and his followers can readily be seen in the spiritual dialogues of Aelred of Rievaulx or the instructional dialogue of Conrad of Hirsau (ca. 1070-ca. 1150). In Conrad's Dialogas super auctores, a teacher instructs an inquisitive pupil on how to approach and understand the works of twenty-one classical authors, among them Prudentius, Horace, Ovid, Homer, and Virgil.38 This student-teacher dialogue (an early contribution to the scholastic ac cessus ad auctores genre) echoes in its opening paragraph the didactic program en countered in Anselm's dialogues, only here it is the student who opens the con versation, saying that the discourse must be carefully controlled; in this way, "the teacher is better able to exercise his goodwill, while . . . the slower partner, that is the learner, who is in dire need, is helped."39 The inquisitive student in search of answers can also be found in the dialogues of Adelard of Bath, whose De eodem et diverso and Questiones naturales offer detailed descriptions of the science and philosophy that he acquired on his travels to eastern lands.40 In both of these works, Adelard presents himself in conversation with his nephew-pupil, whose criticism of and curiosity about his uncle's travels form the Dialogues," 242, 245, stresses the equality of interlocutors and their "spirit of tolerance and open in quiry." The medieval dialogue is the subject of increasing attention, notably by scholars in France and Germany. A conference in Paris in June 2010, inspired by the work of Peter von Moos, was devoted to the topic of the dialogue form in the exempta literature of the Middle Ages. I am grateful to Jean-Claude Schmitt for sharing with me his contribution to the conference proceedings ahead of publication. 37 For general remarks about the history of disputation, see Brian Lawn, The Rise and Decline of the Scholastic "Quaestio Disputata": With Special Emphasis on Its Use in the Teaching of Medicine and Science (Leiden, 1993), chaps. 1-3.

See also R. N. Swanson, The Twelfth-Century Renaissance (Manchester, 1999), 35: "The quaestio was a format mainly for the masters; students had their own oral academic exercises. In the twelfth century (but perhaps emerging from older roots) the disputation became their characteristic academic exercise." 38 For an extended discussion of this work, see Leslie G.

Adelard refers to the discussion in Questiones naturales as a "disputatio" and ends De eodem et diverso by asking his nephew to "judge for yourself whether I have disputed rightly (utrum recte disputaverim)."41 The tone of these works does not rise beyond that of a friendly and affectionate conversation, but Adelard's dialogical approach is consistent with a new generation of dialecti cians. He begins Questiones naturales by reminding his nephew that seven years ear lier, he sent him and other students to study in French schools (in Gallicis studiis) at Laon, a major center of learning in the early twelfth century.42 The dialogue form that Adelard cultivated very likely reflected the dialectical procedures of such "French schools," just as his emphasis on reason (ratio) surely reflected the new currents in early-twelfth-century thought.43 A transitional figure in the emergence of disputation out of dialogue is the Bene dictine abbot Rupert of Deutz (ca. 1075-1129), the twelfth century's most prolific author and a staunch defender of traditional monasticism.44 In his effort to con trovert what he saw as the intrusion of dialectic into the sphere of theological study, Rupert engaged in public disputes at Liège, Laon, and Châlons-sur-Marnes.45 The topics of debate differed from one disputation to the next, but Rupert did not shrink from opportunities to face off with his adversaries, who dismissed him on account of his ignorance of dialectics. He proudly recounted his combative position several years later in his apologetically written commentary on the Benedictine rule (ca. 1125). He went to France, he says, in order to engage in a mighty battle of disputation (praelium disputationis) with those famous masters whose authority was always held over and against him.46 Portraying himself as seated on a paltry ass, with only a servant boy to accompany him, Rupert combines the imagery of a lone protector of the faith with the vocabulary of feudal combat as he describes his expedition to join battle {ad conflictum) in distant cities in France, where a large band of masters and students met him in order to hear his arguments and defeat them. Rupert's use of such colorful imagery is more than just rhetorical flourish. Peter Abelard employed much the same language in his own autobiographical apology: "I preferred the weap ons of dialectic to all the other teachings of philosophy, and armed with these I chose the conflicts of disputation [conflictus pretuli disputationem] instead of the trophies 41 Burnett, Adelard of Bath, 91, 73. 42 The existence and importance of the school of Laon has been a topic of considerable debate among scholars. Most recently, see the study by Cédric Giraud, Per verba magistri: Anselme de Laon et son école au XIIe siècle (Turnhout, 2010); and supplemented by Giraud, "L'école de Laon entre arts du langage et théologie," in Rosier-Catach, Arts du langage et théologie aux confins des XIe-XIIe siècles, 351-371.

Holopainen, Dialectic and Theology in the Eleventh Century (Leiden, 1996). 43 Cf.

American Historical Review \pril 2012</page><page sequence="14">Toward a Cultural History of Scholastic Disputation 343 of war."47 Abelard, of course, actually did come from a knightly background, and in Paris he strove to use the tools of logic and the methods of dialectic in precisely the manner to which Rupert objected, throughout his works defending the virtues of questioning and the value of disputation.48 A comparable description of disputation is given, but with a different purpose, by Herman of Cologne (d. 1181), the Rhineland Jew turned Premonstratensian canon whose Opusculum de conversione sua is a rare (and still controversial) specimen of a medieval autobiographical conversion nar rative.49 In the second chapter of the Opusculum, Herman states that it was the intense conversations that he heard among clerics that compelled him to inquire into the sacraments of the Church. Listening in on these conversations led him to chal lenge the leading cleric of the day, Rupert of Deutz, to a public disputation (ad disputationis invito conflictum).50 It would ultimately take the prayers of two pious women to bring about Herman's conversion, but disputation remained a theme of his progression toward Christianity until finally he took on the role of disputing his former coreligionists, but as a representative of Christianity. Thus, within a fifteen year period (1120-1135), three separate accounts describe the conflicts of dispu tation (two of them involving Rupert) and the centrality that public dispute had come to assume in intellectual life. It is not that these texts are necessarily interrelated or that one author was echoing another; rather, these years represent a transitional moment in the rise of disputation as a cultural practice. From an art historical per spective, increasingly frequent images of debate, and especially of Paul disputing with Jews, are notable features in the development of twelfth-century iconography.51 A crucial parallel to the use of debate in theological circles is the renewed study of Roman law, first in northern Italy and eventually in France as well. The systematic study of canon law often centered upon the use of a question-and-answer format for 47 Peter Abelard, Historia calamitatum: Texte critique, avec une introduction, ed. J. Monfrin (Paris, 1959), 63-64. For a discussion of this passage, see Jacques Le Goff, "Quelle conscience l'université médiévale a-t-elle eu d'elle-même?" in Paul Wilpert, ed., Beiträge zum Berufsbewusstsein des mittel alterlichen Menschen (Berlin, 1964), 16-19. 48 Abelard's disputatious career is the stuff of legend, although this has somewhat clouded what his contribution to the scholastic method actually was. I have here deliberately focused on other, equally instructive examples from his generation, as my point about the rise of disputation is more about the culture as a whole than about any single individual. For analysis of Abelard's own anti-Jewish dialogue in the context of the Jewish-Christian debate, see Alex J. Novikoff, "Reason and Natural Law in the Disputational Writings of Peter Alfonsi, Peter Abelard, and Yehuda Halevi," in Michael Frassetto, ed., Christian Attitudes toward the Jews in the Middle Ages: A Casebook (London, 2007), 109-136. 49 The historiographical debate over the "authenticity" of this account is fully reviewed in Jean Claude Schmitt, The Conversion of Herman the Jew: Autobiography, History, and Fiction in the Twelfth Century, trans. Alex J. Novikoff (Philadelphia, 2010), esp. chap. 1, "Fiction and Truth." Schmitt himself adopts a somewhat nuanced position, suggesting that a real Jew named Herman may indeed lie behind the account, but that the Opusculum as the text exists is the product of a community of Premonstratensian canons whose main ambition was to augment the new order's prestige by embellishing a foundation legend. 50 Hermannus quondam Judaeus: Opusculum de conversione sua, ed.

From the significant portions of the Digest that were made available, medieval jurists learned how to frame sophisticated legal arguments, how to manipulate legal categories, how to analyze problems, and how to find solutions to apparently contradictory opinions.55 52 Stephan Kuttner employed the very phraseology of the twelfth-century theologians, with a nod to the development of Parisian polyphony as well, in the title of his now-famous essay on the topic, Harmony from Dissonance: An Interpretation of Medieval Canon Law (Latrobe, Pa., 1960). Twenty-six years later, Charles Donahue, Jr., lamented the meager advances that had been made in interpreting the legal texts that survive: Why the History of Canon Law Is Not Written (London, 1986). 53 Like scholastic university disputations, scholarship on the legal uses of disputation has focused heavily on the later periods. See, for example, Manlio Bellomo, ed., Die Kunst der Disputation: Probleme der Rechtsauslegung und Rechtsanwendung im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert (Munich, 1997). 54 James A. Brundage, The Medieval Origins of the Legal Profession: Canonists, Civilians, and Courts (Chicago, 2008), 77. 55 Ibid., 77-78.

American Historical Review April 2012</page><page sequence="16">Toward a Cultural History of Scholastic Disputation 345 A significant figure in promoting the new methods for reconciling conflicting texts was Bishop Ivo of Chartres (d. 1115), whose treatise on legal interpretation and whose collection of church law, the Panormia, were once hailed for having antici pated the methods of scholasticism, in part because he explicitly acknowledged the problem of contradictory texts.56 Modern scholarship on Ivo has modified this por trait: his authorship of tht Panormia is no longer certain, and his method of handling contradictory texts is now being examined in a more theological and more local—less judicial and less papal—context.57 Ivo is reported to have been a former student of Lanfranc at the Norman abbey of Bee, and if the twelfth-century source for this tradition is to be trusted, his application of dialectics to the legal tradition would owe something to the same pioneering circle that included Anselm. Ivo's continuators, and especially the "Four Doctors" associated with Bologna, further developed the method of probing contrasting opinions and "initiated a culture of juristic debate that was to become an integral part of medieval learning."58 From simple antinomies in the sources to hypothetical cases, from real difficulties in interpreting a legal term to the didactic device of formulating statements as questions, the quaestiones of the glossators offer a broad example of the application of dialectic in the field of law.59 They were sometimes clad in the dress of a Socratic dialogue, like the dialogues of Rogerius; sometimes presented as a more elementary question-and-answer cate chism; and sometimes made into the structural elements of a summa, like the fre quently copied Summa decretalium quaestionum by Honorius of Richmond (late 1100s). The most famous canonical collection of the twelfth century, by an elusive master known to us simply as Gratian (ca. 1140), displays the centrality of this approach in the very title he gave his work: Concordia discordantium canonum (Harmony of Dis cordant Canons).60 The structural resemblance to Peter Abelard's Sic et non, in which seemingly conflicting statements of the church fathers are placed side by side, has long intrigued scholars, even if the precise relationship between the two authors remains uncertain.61 The presumption had initially been that theological argumen tation preceded legal argumentation, and that Gratian derived his knowledge of the scholastic method from Abelard. In the early twentieth century, legal historians were hard-pressed to place the influence in the direction from law to theology.62 The latest Müller, "The Recovery of Justinian's Digest in the Middle Ages," Bulletin of Medieval Canon Law 20 (1990): 1-29. 56 Paul Fournier and Gabriel le Bras, Histoire des collections canoniques en Occident depuis les Fausses decrétales jusqu'au Décret de Gratian, 2 vols.

Novikoff manuscript analysis once again argues the reverse, and theological texts other than Abelard have been suggested as sources of Gratian's method of argumentation.63 The causal influence may never be solved, nor need it be, for what is at issue is the very spread of a culture of disputation that was not restricted to a single area of inquiry but rather pervaded the ideas, texts, and culture of the entire period. As Stephan Kuttner rightly cautioned, "It was a mistaken question, based on a search for 'influences' where the reality was that of an intellectual climate which became apparent at the same time but in different ways north, west, and south, wherever the need for organizing knowledge in a comprehensive, rational manner was felt."64 This intellectual climate, an emerging culture of disputation, blossomed when a wave of translations broke on the shore of twelfth-century Europe in the form of Aristotle's New Logic. The rise of scholastic disputation out of dialogue within legal and theological circles might have remained a minor byproduct of the new schools and scholars of the twelfth century had it not been for the recovery of Aristotle's Topics and So phistical Refutations, works that dealt directly with the dialectical process of forming and refuting arguments.65 The translation and transmission of this "New Logic" in the middle of the twelfth century had a profound impact on the direction that scho lastic disputation would take, lending authority and guidance to the practice most characteristic of the medieval schoolmen. An early witness to the importance of Aristotle for medieval disputation was Adam of Balsham. His logical treatise Ars disserendi of about 1132 (perhaps best translated as the Art of Discourse) survives incomplete and exists in two recensions, the second one appearing with important changes under the title Dialéctica Alex andri, probably out of association with Adam's most illustrious follower in the second half of the twelfth century, Alexander Neckham.66 Little is known about Adam's life, but over his career he circulated among the most prominent teachers and clerics in Tijdschríft voor Rechtsgeschiedenis 16 (1939): 1-67, here 52: "Even in French theology which was, of course, much more closely connected with Aristotle than with Italian jurisprudence, disputations did not become a feature of the curriculum until well after the middle of the twelfth century, and it must there fore have been jurisprudence which influenced theology, Bologna which influences Paris, not vice versa." Cf. John W. Baldwin, The Scholastic Culture of the Middle Ages, 1000-1300 (Prospect Heights, 111., 1971), 75: "Originating from the contentious nature of legal science, the disputation passed from the Roman lawyers of Bologna to the canonists and the theologians." 63 See the relevant conclusions reached by John Wei, "Gratian and the School of Laon," Traditio 64 (2009): 279-322, here 320: "Gratian must have learned the scholastic method for reconciling con tradictory authorities from a contemporary theologian or contemporary theological work." Cf. Landau, "The Development of Law," 122, discussing Ivo of Chartres: "As regards procedural law, his attitudes towards the ordeal (judicium Dei) betray an incipient rationalisation, doubtless under the influence of early scholasticism." 64 Kuttner, "The Revival of Jurisprudence," 310. 65 Cf.

A younger contemporary, John of Salisbury, met Adam probably between 1136 and 1138 in Paris and recorded his gratitude at having learned "a great deal from his explanations," although he also said of Adam's writing that he got so involved in verbal intricacies that his exposition was of very little use.67 Indeed, it is probably the highly technical nature of the treatise that has caused it to be so often ignored in modern scholarship, even though it represents, as its modern editor states, the first time that "Aristotle's Topics and Sophistici Elenchi were put into contribution [s/c] in an original treatise by a Latin writing author."68 Adam thought that the language or the textbooks was antiquated and that the present revival of dialectic would change the understanding and practice of debate. With fresh translations of Aristotle in hand, and a considerable reliance on Boethian logic as well, he undertook to produce a handbook containing all that was essential for mastering logic. He mentioned the currency of disputes and the lack of any formal rules governing their procedure as one of his reasons for writing the treatise: "There was not yet the custom of disputing, for then there was only the beginning, not as yet an art of disputing, for one ought to dispute before an art can be made of it."69 Accordingly, his focus was on discourse in the form of questions and answers, for he believed that it was from enuntio and interrogatio that the principles of discourse were to be found. In underscoring the principles of debate, Adam illustrates the nexus between contemporary scholastic discourse and Aristotelian argumentation. John of Salisbury, writing a generation later, offers an even more conspicuous example of Aristotle's impact on the emerging practice of scholastic disputation. His celebrated Metalogicon (1159), dedicated to Thomas Becket, is a defense of the ver bal and logical arts of the trivium against the charges of the pseudonymous Corni ficius and his fellow opponents of a liberal arts education. In particular, the Meta logicon reveals the growing divide among scholars over the nature of education, and especially what role should be played by the newly translated texts of Aristotle.70 John wished that classroom disputation would rid itself of unnecessary verbiage and return to the systematic logic it aimed to uphold.71 Logic, as he defined it, was the science of argumentative reasoning.72 It was precisely on the subject of logic that he saw scholastic disputation and Aristotle merging, the latter benefiting the former.73 John ranges widely in the Metalogicon. He addresses the question ot genera and species and the philosophical issue of universals, and he offers precious and insight ful commentary on the education and personalities of other masters of his day.

Novikojj time and again he returns to Aristotle s work, citing its relevance to contemporary dialectic and especially the practical matter of disputation. Chapter 10 in Book III of the Metalogicon is expressly devoted to the "usefulness" (utilitate) of Book VIII of Aristotle's Topics, which addresses the methods of verbal reasoning. Seizing on the now-familiar metaphor of disputation as a form of verbal combat, John explains how Aristotle can best prepare the young scholastic: [Aristotle], the drill-master of those who profess to be logicians, has in the foregoing books, as it were, provided the means of disputation [instrumenta disputandi], and stacked in the arena arms for the use of his students. This he has done by explaining the meanings of un combined words and clarifying the nature of propositions and topics. His next step is to show his disciples how they may use these instruments, and somehow to teach them the art of engaging in [argumentative] combat.74 John s explication or Aristotle was clearly meant to guide students (and perhaps masters, too) in the art of disputation as well as in its proper application. Others of his generation who were opposed to dialectic might well have found cause to disagree with his assessment, but there is no mistaking its relevance for contemporary mas ters; the return of Aristotle was catalyzing the practice most characteristic of the schools of his day, and the one most problematic for upholders of the monastic attitude toward learning: disputation. The recovery of Aristotle's Topics in the mid-twelfth century marks a significant moment in the formative development of scholastic disputation. While knowledge of the later, and better-documented, university disputado is necessary for a full ap preciation of this contribution, John of Salisbury himself makes note in the Meta logicon of the dramatic changes brought about by the Aristotelian impact. "If what [Book VIII] teaches is both borne in mind and correctly observed," he remarks, "it contributes more to the science of argumentative reasoning than practically all the works on dialectic that our modern predecessors were accustomed to teach in the schools."75 He then proceeds to examine point by point the ways in which Book VIII of the Topics can, and should, serve as a textbook for scholars involved in dialectic and the practice of disputation.76 This aspect of logic constitutes the centerpiece of John's defense of the trivium as a whole, and it is well worth noting that his focus on the practical rules of disputation as outlined in Book VIII of Aristotle's Topics constitutes the second-lengthiest chapter in the entire Metalogicon. What John of Salisbury needed to explain, defend, and correct, Peter the Chanter of Notre Dame (d. 1197), writing a generation later, plainly assumed: "The training of Holy Scripture consists of three exercises: reading (lectio), disputing (disputado) and preaching (predicado)."11 As the choirmaster and second-ranking dignitary of 74 Ioannis Saresberiensis Metalogicon, ed.

He likens the master of theology to the architect of a building, with reading providing the basement, disputation the structural walls, and preaching the roof.79 To avoid the dangers associated with use less questioning (inutilitate questionum), he urges his fellow theologians to fashion their debates not into altercations (altercationes) but into more productive conver sations (collationes), which will yield a common inquiry after truth.80 Calm delib eration should be the order of the day, not theatrical debates.81 The pedagogical art of disputation that had been anticipated by Adam of Balsham and defended by John of Salisbury was now, for the first time, explicitly incorporated into the cultural prac tices of Parisian education. Among the many issues during the twelfth century that would come to divide monastic theologians from scholastic theologians was this very practice of disputa tion, a concept that was still loosely defined but was increasingly central in the day to-day activities of a liberal arts training. During the several generations from An selm to Peter the Chanter, there was an unmistakable evolution in the meaning and use of disputado, from the simpler spiritual conversation or investigation to the more intense debate—debates about new questions, debates about old questions, indeed debates about the very usefulness of debating. What is more, disputation and dia logue became a common currency for scholars and clerics in their struggle to define what constituted theology and what constituted education. Over the course of the twelfth century, the terms and methods of analysis gained greater meaning as well as greater precision. As Henri de Lubac pointedly remarked about this intellectual shift, "while monastic 'lectio' tended . . . toward meditation and prayer, scholastic 'lectio' tends towards the question and the disputation. It is directed toward a kind of disputation which, although it is not absolutely new, monopolizes the meaning of this word more and more. What we have here again is a fact of language that can serve as an emblem of the evolution which is in progress."82 This cultural evolution took a decisive turn in the early thirteenth century with the institutionalization of disputation as a central component of university education. 78 For a more recent and revisionist assessment of the Chanter's contributions to logic and theology, but with attention focused on a different text, see Luisa Valente, Phantasia contrarietatis: Contraddizioni scritturali, discorso teologico e arti del linguaggio nel "De tropis loquendi" di Pietro Cantore (d. 1197) (Florence, 1997).

Having originated in scholastic circles, university disputation has been a hallmark of the Western intellectual tra dition from the Middle Ages down to the modern viva voce dissertation defense.83 Among the earliest examples of disputations held for the benefit of bachelors and students are the Quaestiones disputatae of Simon of Tournai, a master in Paris from ca. 1165 to 1201 who in his youth had attended the classes (and disputations) on law in Bologna.84 Dating from the last decade of the twelfth century, on the eve of the formal recognition of the University of Paris, Simon's Quaestiones consist of 102 disputations containing 371 individual questions dealing with a wide, but standard, array of topics relating to Christian theology, including the Trinity, Christological problems, original sin, the morality of human actions, virtues and vices, and the sacraments.85 Details about the conduct of these disputations are generally few, but some sense of the events can nevertheless be discerned.86 Master Simon, seated in his chair (Symon sedet ), directed each discussion by introducing the question of the day, supplying the necessary authorities (auctoritates), responding to objections, and finally offering the solution. The number of questions to be disputed varied from one day to the next, and sometimes Simon had to remind his audience that a certain topic had already been discussed (alibi discussum est). At other times he interrupted the disputation to postpone further discussion until another day.87 His popularity as a debater is confirmed by the testimony of the English chronicler Matthew Paris (d. 1259), who pauses in his wide-ranging Chronica majora to tell us that even the largest lecture hall could scarcely contain the crowds of students who flocked to hear Simon. For if Simon lectured well, Matthew writes, he disputed even better.88 Other figures of note in the Paris of King Philip II Augustus (r. 1179-1223) confirm this reputation: Henry of Brussels, Gerald of Wales, and Thomas of Cantimpré each remarked on how many students Simon seemed to attract with his disputations, speaking scorn fully of his inordinate pride.89 Not since the days of Peter Abelard had the dispu tations of a lecturer in theology provoked such sentiments of admiration, contempt, and even jealousy. Scholars are in agreement that the University of Paris was not founded, but rather grew.90 Many of the intellectual and even structural components of what would be 83 For general remarks, see the learned study by William Clark, Academic Charisma and the Origins of the Research University (Chicago, 2006), esp. chap. 3.

Novikoff come the university were already firmly in place by the end of the twelfth century, including a lively controversy over the place of disputation in the lecture halls.91 The statutes of 1215 that gave recognition to the corporation of masters and students (universitas magistrorum et scholarium) also laid down teaching programs and pro cedures (including appropriate days and times for lecturing and disputing), regulated academic custom at official gatherings and clothing and occasions for mourning, confirmed the rules for examinations, set the minimum age for lecturing in the arts at twenty-one and for lecturing in theology at thirty-five, and repeated that masters should exercise jurisdiction over scholars.92 Over the next several centuries, the dis putatio flourished in its new institutional home and became an essential ingredient in the basic organization of academic learning.93 The formalized practice of disputation in Paris took root in the faculty of arts as well as in the faculties of advanced learning: theology, medicine, and canon law.94 Several different forms of university disputations developed in the period following 1215.95 The disputado ordinaria was held at regular intervals, usually in the morning, for the benefit of bachelors and students.96 It was presided over by a master, who announced beforehand the question that would be asked. One bachelor, the oppo nens, supplied arguments against the thesis, while another, the respondens, attempted to answer the objections that were raised and to demonstrate their weakness.97 The master typically gave a summing-up or determinatio at the end, but not in all cases, 91 On the social context of the early history of the University of Paris, see Jacques Verger, "A propos de la naissance de l'Université de Paris: Contexte social, enjeu politique, portée intellectuelle," in Jo hannes Fried, ed., Schulen und Studium im sozialen Wandel des hohen und späten Mittelalters (Sigmar ingen, 1986), 69-96.

Bazàn, "Les questions disputées, principalement dans les facultés de theologie," in Bazàn et al., Les questions disputées et les questions quodlibétiques, 21-49. Further information on the definition of the genre can be found in the chapters by Wippel, Fransen, and Jacquart. At the Italian universities and at Oxford and Cambridge, which began as offshoots of the University of Paris in the early thirteenth century, the documentation concerning academic practices is plentiful only from about the middle of the thirteenth century. See A. G. Little and F. Pelster, Oxford Theology and Theologians, c. A.D. 1282 1302 (Oxford, 1934), 29-30. 96 This basic form of disputation is also variously called a disputatio solemnis or disputatio publica. In addition to disputatio quodlibetalis, these quodlibets could also be called disputatio communis and disputatio generalis. 97 For a technical discussion of the art, see Ignacio Angelelli, "The Techniques of Disputation in the History of Logic," Journal of Philosophy 67, no. 20 (1970): 800-815.

A second kind of disputation, the disputatio de quolibet, soon gained currency m the university.100 Once thought to owe its genesis to Thomas Aquinas, the quodlibet made its appearance sometime in the second quarter of the thirteenth century.101 In contrast to the ordinary disputation, which focused on specific topics announced beforehand and which was held for the benefit of students and faculty only, questions posed at these disputations were offered de quolibet ("about anything at all") and could cover any number of subjects, ranging across theology, metaphysics, canon law, and medicine. In addition, the initiative for the subjects debated lay with the au dience, and the disputing master never knew beforehand what questions would be asked. Less frequent than the private disputations, these quodlibetical disputations generally took place in the Latin Quarter's rue du Fouarre (vicus straminis), and only during Advent and Lent. Most especially, they were open to the general public and attracted a diverse, even "international," audience.102 Masters and scholars from other schools might attend. All kinds of ecclesiastics and prelates, and even civil authorities, might have been present—indeed, all the "intellectuals" of the time who were attracted by skirmishes of this kind, and all of whom had a desire to ask ques tions and oppose arguments.103 So great was the popularity of disputing that by the later thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the art and practice of debate evolved into newer forms, such as the disputationibus de sophismatibus and the ars obliga toria,104 It is the early history of quodlibetal disputations that is most interesting trom a cultural historical perspective. In addition to the fact that they quickly became a staple of the university calendar and spread beyond the faculty of theology in Paris where they began, there are other reasons why these ritualized spectacles should have been so popular. It has rightly been observed that the public gatherings at quodlibetical disputations recall the performance of drama, which was flourishing in 98 There is some uncertainty as to exactly how long after the disputation the determination took place. Palémon Glorieux maintained that it occurred on the first reading day following the disputation. See Glorieux, "L'enseignement au Moyen âge: Techniques et méthodes en usage à la Faculté de théolo gie de Paris au XIIIe siècle," Archives d'histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen âge 35 (1968): 65-186, here 126. But see also Little and Pelster, Oxford Theology and Theologians, 229, who are less certain about how soon after the disputation the determination might have been given. Bazàn, "Les espèces du genre," in Bazàn et al., Les questions disputées et les questions quodlibétiques, 61-62, has nothing further to contribute toward a solution. 99 The disputatio privata is less well documented than the other types of university disputations. See Bazàn, "Les espèces du genre," 62. 100 The most comprehensive treatment of this literature, even if it was intended only as a "first ori entational study," remains Palémon Glorieux, La littérature quodlibétique de 1260 à 1320, 2 vols. (Le Saulchoir, Kain, 1925-1935). 101 The quodlibetical disputation (and its twentieth-century historiography) is explained in detail in the chapters by John Wippel in Bazàn et al., Les questions disputées et les questions quodlibétiques, 153— 222. 102 Glorieux, La littérature quodlibétique de 1260 à 1320, 2: 10. 103 Lawn, The Rise and Decline of the Scholastic "Quaestio disputata," 16. 104 These later forms of argumentation flourished especially in England.

The flowering of polyphonic composition offers an especially intriguing cultural manifestation of scholastic disputation because it emanates not only from the same time and place (late-twelfth-century Paris), but from the same circle of scholars and teachers.107 As the eminent musicologist Richard Taruskin has noted, "the burgeoning of poly phonic composition followed the exact same trajectory [as scholastic education] . . . it reached its first great, transfiguring culmination in the cathedral schools of Paris, and in a new form it radiated from the cosmopolitan center throughout Western Christendom, receiving a special ancillary cultivation in the universities."108 We might go further. In cultural terms, polyphony is one of a group of tactics deployed 105 Jody Enders, "The Theater of Scholastic Erudition, Comparative Drama 27, no. 3 (Fall 1993): 341-363, here 344.

Novikoff to enhance the delivery of liturgical song, the song being an enhanced reading of a ritual text, and hence it is an enhancement of the ritual act itself. Polyphony served to bring to the fore the harmonía—the consonando implicit in the song—and thus to highlight the text that the song embellished. Since most polyphony from the twelfth century onward entailed responsorial chants either directly or indirectly, it threw into relief the relationship of the Mass (the gradual, the alleluia, etc.) with the scripture on which the chant commented, hence emphasizing the overall harmonía inherent in the body of scripture. Harmony, in simple terms, is counterpoint slowed down; counterpoint, like disputatio, is a cultural expression of dialectic and rhetoric. Broadly speaking, the principles that Abelard applied to theology and that Gratian applied to law, polyphony applied to music. Closely affiliated with the early history of the University of Pans is another mu sical innovation that is even more explicitly a dialogue of voices: the motet. Simply defined as a piece of music in several parts with words (from the Old French, mot), it first appeared in connection with Parisian scholastic circles, and in particular with the career of Philip the Chancellor of Notre Dame, head of the University of Paris from 1218 until his death in 1236.109 Very early on, the capacity of the motet to carry arguments pro and contra, to engage in dialectic and irony, began to be systematically exploited and used in increasingly sophisticated ways, so that by 1300, the motet (like the quodlibet) deployed these tactics in virtuoso fashion.110 Recently described as the least-studied major figure of thirteenth-century thought, Philip the Chancellor exemplifies the cultural fabric that braided music, poetry, and university adminis tration.111 His poem Beata viscera ("O Blessed womb"), in honor of the Virgin, was set to music by one of the most celebrated composers of Parisian polyphony, Pero tin.112 Philip is also credited with two well-known debates that are found in several manuscripts with their melodies: Disputatio membrorum is a debate between various parts of the body, and the even better known Quisquís cordis et oculi is an altercado between heart and eye.113 Close examination of other elements of his monophonie 109 See especially Thomas B.

Payne has observed that the correspondence of at least three attributable multi-texted polyphonic works operates explicitly as a debate, thus pre senting the listener with a situation analogous to a scholastic disputation, particularly since the subject matter is the praise and criticism of the clergy.115 "Just as the two poems in the motetus and triplum contend, each taking sides in a disputation on the morality and corruption of the clergy, so do all the voices spar rhythmically."116 Not only are there simultaneous utterances on both sides of the debate, but in some instances there is the additional offering of a judgment by a third party, thus imitating the final determination that concludes a scholastic disputation.117 Philip the Chan cellor well illustrates the penetration of scholastic ideas into multiple cultural spheres, and it is no minor coincidence that his innovations in song, poetry, and polemic coincided with a remarkable output in debate poems (in vernacular lan guages as well as Latin) during the early thirteenth century.118 Debate poems and polyphonic music oner tantalizing possibilities tor extra-uni versity manifestations of scholastic disputation. An even more illustrative example of the practice or application of disputation in the thirteenth century is the Church's confrontation with Judaism and Jews, longtime targets of ecclesiastical polemic, and often in works cast in the dialogue form.119 To be sure, there existed a long tradition of polemics adversus Iudaeos ("against the Jews") going back to the church fathers, Conductus: A Catalogue Raisonné," Miscellanea Musicologica 6 (1972): 153-229, 7 (1975): 1-81.

Thomas B. Payne (Middleton, Wis., 2011). Philip at the time was at odds with the bishop of Paris, William of Auvergne. Perotin sided with Philip and supplied the musical (and rhythmically oppositional) elements for the double motet Ypocrite pseudopontifices. 116 Ibid., XXV. 117 According to Payne, ibid., xix, the motets "adopt opposite stances in each of the upper voices, with the motetus dispensing an opinion on one side of the disputation, and the triplum taking the other. In each of these cases the disagreement between the texts is borne out ingeniously by their musical settings as double motets: each position is disclaimed simultaneously with the other, resulting in a verbal discord that, ironically, is offset by the harmonious musical setting that combines them." 118 Debate in one form or another was a staple of courtly and clerical entertainment even before the thirteenth century. There are debates between Wine and Water and Winter and Summer, as well as many love dialogues, including De Ganymede and Helena and, most popular of all, the Knight versus the Clerk, a debate about who is the better lover. Beginning in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, there are debate poems in many of the vernacular languages. In Provençal they are called joc-partit, partimen, and tenso-, in German, Wechsel; and in Old French, jeux-partis (orpartures), in which some two hundred survive, many of them with their music attached.

Novikoff the development of which can be traced in the writings of medieval Christian au thors.120 A catalogue of these anti-Jewish polemics points to a typology in which an older style that paid particular attention to interpretations of the biblical text, such as Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho (second century) and Augustine's Adversus Judaeos (fifth century), was distinguished from newer forms of argumentation in the twelfth century that were characterized by a focus on "reason" (ratio) and that tar geted the Talmud and post-biblical Jewish literature.121 A sustained body of schol arship since the 1980s has illuminated the complex conceptions that underpin the medieval intellectual encounter with Jews and Judaism, what Jeremy Cohen fa mously dubbed "the hermeneutical Jew."122 Absent from this important field of his torical analysis is an explanation of one of the most basic and fundamental features of this encounter: the fact that it was a dialogue, both metaphorically and literally a disputation. While it may seem logical that Jewish-Christian encounters would have been given a new thrust by the formalization of disputation in scholastic circles and uni versities, there is in fact a paradox: throughout the thirteenth century, the Church was perpetually concerned with regulating interactions between Christians and Jews. The introduction of the "Jewish Badge" at Lateran IV in 1215 is the most obvious example of an attempt to maintain segregation between Christian and Jewish com munities, but many other edicts of Church councils and missives of the popes spe cifically sought to forbid religious disputations of the sort mentioned in the dialogues of the twelfth century.123 Thus in an addendum to the synodical rules issued around 120 Cf. Jaroslav Pelikan, The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition (100-600) (Chicago, 1971), 15: "virtually every major Christian writer of the first five centuries either composed a treatise in opposition to Judaism or made this issue the dominant theme in a treatise devoted to some other subject." The two best treatments of the medieval Christian intellectual engagement with Jews and Judaism are Gilbert Dahan, Les intellectuels chrétiens et les juifs au Moyen âge (Paris, 1990); and Jeremy Cohen, Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity (Berkeley, Calif., 1999). See also the important studies by Anna Sapir Abulafia, Christians and Jews in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance (London, 1995) and Christians and Jews in Dispute: Disputational Literature and the Rise of Anti-Judaism in the West (c. 1000 1150) (Aldershot, 1998). 121 Heinz Schreckenberg, Die christlichen Adversus-Judaeos-Texte (11.-13. Jh.) (Frankfurt, 1991). A leading advocate in arguing for a connection between the rational developments of the twelfth-century renaissance and the negative impact on the Jewish-Christian debate is Anna Sapir Abulafia (see fn. 120). The foundational brick in this line of inquiry was laid by Amos Funkenstein, "Changes in the Patterns of Christian Anti-Jewish Polemic in the Twelfth Century" (in Hebrew), Zion, n.s., 33 (1968): 125-144. An abbreviated and slightly reoriented version of the essay subsequently appeared in English as "Basic Types of Christian Anti-Jewish Polemics in the Later Middle Ages," Viator 2 (1971): 373-382. 122 Cohen, Living Letters of the Law, 2-3 n. 3.

For the iconography of anti-Judaism in the Middle Ages, see especially Heinz Schreckenberg, The Jews in Christian Art: An Illustrated History (New York, 1996), esp. 222-235 for images of dialogue and debate; and Sara Lipton, Images of Intolerance: The Representation of Jews and Judaism in the Bible Moralisée (Berkeley, Calif., 1999), 3-4, who wisely cautions against direct causation between visual representations and contemporary events. 123 The "veracity" of these Jewish-Christian dialogues that purport to be based on actual encounters has long exercised the minds of scholars interested in Jewish-Christian intellectual relations. In my opinion, the emphasis is at least partially misplaced, for it is a common literary device, and separating truth from fiction is highly problematic (cf.

In the 1190s, the prolific man of letters Peter of Blois warned that "as a result of illicit and careless debates, a virulent crop of heresies runs wild."127 Ecclesiastical decrees explicitly limiting both open and private exchanges be tween Christians and Jews represent one aspect of the papal monarchy's consoli dation of power. The circumstances that led to the Paris disputation in 1240 rep resent another: the Church's sanctioning of properly controlled public disputations. Just as the Dominican Order's preaching activities demonstrated the importance of disputation as a weapon for combating heretics and non-believers, so too did the Paris disputation, or the "Talmud trial," as it is often termed, demonstrate the Church's attempt to manipulate disputation on an unprecedented scale.128 The immediate cause for the events of 1240-1242 was a series of condemnatory bulls issued by Pope Gregory IX in 1239 ordering the rulers and prelates in Europe to impound the Talmud and other Jewish writings on the first Sabbath during Lent in 1240.129 Gregory's call was a delayed reaction to a plea he had received in 1236 from an evidently embittered Jewish apostate named Nicholas Donin, who presented the pope with thirty-five accusations against the Talmud and its Jewish exponents.130 There is little that can be said with certainty about Donin's Jewish background, or for that matter his motives.'31 At least a dozen of the thirty-five articles condemned the Talmud for its perceived absurd homilies, in much the same way that Peter Al fonsi and Peter the Venerable had done a century earlier.132 Donin's accusations, however, were uniquely transformed into a staged event when King Louis IX (r. 126 The Church and the Jews 69 (March 5, 1233): 200-201. 127 Contra perfidiam Judaeorum, PL 207: 825.

Michèle Mulchahey, "First the Bow Is Bent in Study": Dominican Education before 1350 (Toronto, 1998), 167-175. For reasons of space, I do not here engage the use of disputation in the anti-heretical campaigns and the closely affiliated rise of the Inquisition, both of which present relevant avenues for further research on the culture of dis putation. 129 Nicholas Donin's original accusations about the alleged blasphemies contained in the Talmud were submitted to Yehiel ben Joseph, who was then forced to respond. According to the Christian account of the disputation, the discussion begins with Donin's announcement that he intends to question Yehiel about the Talmud, which he states is four hundred year old, and ends with a so-called "confession" in which Yehiel ben Joseph and Judah ben David admit that the Talmud passages were correctly quoted, but resolutely deny that they contained any blasphemies against Christ or Christians. See Isidore Loeb, La controverse sur le Talmud sous Saint Louis (Paris, 1881), 21-54; Joel E. Rembaum, "The Talmud and the Popes: Reflections on the Talmud Trials of the 1240's," Viator 13 (1982): 202-223; Robert Chazan, "The Condemnation of the Talmud Reconsidered (1239-1248)," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research 55 (1988): 11-30; Hyam Maccoby, Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Public Dispu tations in the Middle Ages (Oxford, 1982), 19-38; Gilbert Dahan, ed., Le brûlement du Talmud à Paris, 1242-1244 (Paris, 1999); and Cohen, Living Letters of the Law, 317-325. 130 For considerations about Donin's background and motives, see Jeremy Cohen, "The Mentality of the Medieval Jewish Apostate: Peter Alfonsi, Hermann of Cologne, and Pablo Christiani," in Todd M. Endelman, ed., Jewish Apostasy in the Modern World (New York, 1987), 20-47, esp. 35-41. 131 But see Jeremy Cohen's attempt to reconstruct the motives of three other apostates of the High Middle Ages, ibid. 132 It seems reasonable to assume that Nicholas was familiar with these earlier works, or at any rate with the arguments contained therein. But whereas the works of Alfonsi and Peter the Venerable re mained words on the page (or, in Alfonsi's case, an imaginary and autobiographical dialogue with his former self), here the dispute has become "public" by virtue of its live hearing.

Donin's decision to take his plaint directly to the pope may reveal a greater de termination on his part than had been exhibited by earlier Jewish converts, but there is a larger cultural context that needs to be appreciated. Donin's move also reflects the new concerns of the papacy, whose authority was far greater in the thirteenth century than it had been in the twelfth. The same can be said of the French monarchy, which had grown measurably since the reign of Philip II Augustus.133 Thus it was not the critique of Judaism and its texts that was new in 1240, or even the part played by a Jewish convert in launching the attack. Rather, it was that the institutional establishments were markedly more competent in handling (or presuming that they could handle) a public disputation with the most knowledgeable Jews of the day.134 The overall appearance of the encounter as a "show trial" belies the efforts of the monarchy to present (we might even say to perform) the event in such a manner as to give the impression of a contrapuntal, scholastic debate that would reveal a deeper truth.135 Most important of all, Paris in the mid-thirteenth century had become the epicenter of a culture of debate and disputation, one that King Louis IX himself actively promoted. In an intriguing passage in Joinville's Life of Saint Louis (com pleted in 1309), a story is told of "a great debate" between clerics and Jews at the monastery of Cluny.136 The abbot reprimands the knight for reacting with violence, while the knight, in turn, chides the abbot for organizing such a debate in the first place. The moral of the story, the king explains to his biographer in language that echoes contemporary Church councils, is "that no man, unless he is a skilled theo logian, should debate with Jews." In another passage in the panegyric, Louis presides at supper over a debate between Joinville and Master Robert de Sorbon (Louis's chaplain and the founder of the Collège de Sorbonne) on the respective merits of laymen and friars, pronouncing his judgment (or, in scholastic terms, determination) following the discussion.137 In life and in legend, King Louis IX was a patron of the schools and a champion of organized and controlled disputation. Some scholars have posited that the disputation of 1240 was in fact only an in quisitorial proceeding and involved no actual debate per se.138 Careful analysis of 1,3 For historical context, see William Chester Jordan, The French Monarchy and the Jews: From Fhihp Augustus to the Last Capetians (Philadelphia, 1989), who discusses the Talmud trial at 137-139. 134 The inclusion of learned Jews as opposition has precedent. For example, both Gilbert Crispin (late eleventh century) and Walter of Châtillon (mid-twelfth century) claimed that their disputations were held with learned authorities of the Jewish community. 135 See the astute comments of Karl F. Morrison, Understanding Conversion (Charlottesville, Va., 1992), 132, concerning public debates between Jews and Christians: "Insofar as they could be re garded as instruments of conversion, they belonged to a repertory of play that included theatrical performances, the spectacle of liturgy, and the visual arts."

American Historical Review April zulz</page><page sequence="33">362 A lex J. Novikojf Latin manuscript 16558 in the Bibhotheque nationale has established that the pro ceedings were in fact divided into two stages: the disputation between Donin and the French rabbis, principally Yehiel ben Joseph, and the more formal ecclesiastical inquiry that eventually led to the burning of the Talmud in 1242.139 Thus the Talmud trial of 1240 bears witness to the confluence of two major and related developments: the formal public disputation as a method for demonstrating truth, and the inquis itorial trial as a method for legally proving that truth and convicting the guilty par ties.140 The principal Christian clerics who served as witnesses during the inquest were Archbishop Walter of Sens, William of Auvergne (bishop of Paris), Geoffrey of Belleville (chaplain to King Louis IX), Adam of Chambly, and Eudes of Châ teauroux (chancellor of the University of Paris). Although the meeting took place on the king's direct orders, Louis IX did not personally preside over the disputation. That task was left to his mother, Queen Blanche of Castile, well known for her patronage of arts and letters. In addition to Yehiel ben Joseph, three other rabbis are known to have taken some part in the trial—"Jews who were regarded among themselves as experts," according to the Christian account.141 Excepting Gerald of Wales's dubious account of Abelard's debate with a Jew in the presence of King Philip I, the disputation of 1240 marks the first recorded instance of a Jewish-Chris tian disputation in the presence of royalty, the first instance of a Jewish-Christian disputation that was presided over by a university official, and the first recorded instance of university officials' pursuit of the characteristically academic disputatio in a non-academic context. As a result of the proceeding, the books of the Talmud were found guilty as charged, and an estimated twenty to twenty-four wagonloads of manuscripts—perhaps ten to twelve thousand volumes, according to Jeremy Co hen—were burned in the Place de Grève over the course of one and a half days in 1242.142 The burning of the Talmud that resulted from the disputation and trial in 1240 proved to be the first in a series of large-scale attacks on rabbinic Judaism that emanated from the papal court and were carried out on the orders of the French monarchy and the Dominican friars.143 Cohen has argued that the Dominican in volvement with this event constituted a new thrust in the Christian confrontation 139 Chen-Melech Merchavia, The Church versus Talmudic and Midrashic Literature, 500-1248 (in Hebrew) (Jerusalem, 1970), 240ff., as cited in Cohen, Living Letters of the Law, 323. 140 Dominican involvement in thirteenth-century inquisition is an area of lively current research. For a deft handling of these features in the context of the battle against heresy, see Christine Caldwell Ames, Righteous Persecution: Inquisition, Dominicans, and Christianity in the Middle Ages (Philadelphia, 2009). 141 See Maccoby Judaism on Trial, 164. The three other Jewish witnesses summoned to the gathering were Judah ben David of Melun, Samuel ben Solomon of Château Thierry, and Moses of Coucy, whose Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (Great Book of Commandments) is one of the earliest codifications of Jewish law (Halakhah). 142 Jeremy Cohen, The Friars and the Jews: The Evolution of Medieval Anti-Judaism (Ithaca, N.Y., 1982), 63. 143 In May 1244, Pope Innocent IV renewed Gregory's original injunctions and asked Louis IX to burn any copies of the Talmud that were found to have survived the first burning. When the Jews this time appealed the sentence to Rome, complaining that they could not practice their religion without the Talmud, the pope commissioned a legatine tribunal to reopen the inquiry. The person chosen to head that inquiry was Eudes of Châteauroux (now cardinal-bishop of Tusculum), and the verdict was upheld, this time with a list of more than forty illustrious signatories from the academic and clerical communities of Paris.

As much as the events of 1240 testified to a new, and chiefly Dominican, engagement with Judaism, the trial also bore witness to the evolution of scholastic disputation as a cultural practice. For while the king's role in convoking the event and the setting for the disputation at the royal court were novel for the period, the presence of Eudes of Châteauroux, the chancellor of the University of Paris, strongly suggests that the disputation was con ceived in accordance with academic principles, and in any case under academic scru tiny and approval. The two-part disputation and inquisitorial trial, followed by the official verdict, evokes the now-established pattern of the university disputado and final determination. Furthermore, the dating of the Talmud trial is contemporary with the first appearance of the disputatio de quolibet, and while the topic of the disputation at the royal court was no surprise to the participants, the manner in which it has come down to us does present notable similarities to Paris's "agonistic" en vironment, and it is fully consistent with Joinville's memorialization of the king. In sum, the disputation of 1240 represents the confluence between the institutional ization of scholastic disputation in Paris and the age-old Christian polemic against Judaism.

First, Anselm and his circle pi oneered a more dynamic and persuasive approach to articulating the tenets of faith, one that relied heavily on the dual power of reason and dialogue; second, the rise of new schools in Italy and northern France and the transference of dialogical writing and learning to these circles allowed disputation to be absorbed into a new "scho lastic" milieu; third, the recovery of Aristotle's New Logic helped to catalyze this new and controversial use of disputation by providing models of dialectic argumentation; fourth, the institutionalization of the university disputado gave disputation a formal academic context that it would retain for centuries to come; and fifth, the application of disputation in the intensifying confrontation with Jews brought academic methods into the age-old Jewish-Christian debate and made public disputation a fixture of late medieval culture. The proliferation of dialogues, debate poems, recorded disputa tions, visual images of debate, and polyphonic music over the same decades points clearly in the direction of disputation's evolution into a cultural practice. By the thirteenth century, a "culture of disputation" had taken root, centered chiefly in Paris, transcending the monastic origins from which it sprang, and extending to many facets of elite and non-elite society. A cultural logic of disputation now emerges. Taking place on the frontier between learned and popular culture, between public and private spheres, between polemic and poetry, and between tragedy and comedy, the rise of disputation out of dialogue represents a cultural mutation in medieval society that can be fully understood only with a broad and interdisciplinary approach to cultural history, one that adequately accounts for the evolution of ideas into practices, and across both time and place. The acknowledged centrality of disputation in the Late Middle Ages and well into the early modern period, where dialogues and disputations abound, suggests that there are more areas to be explored and more connections to be found. A complete understanding of the history of disputation demands further analysis using an in clusive, not exclusive, approach to medieval culture. Alex J. Novikoff is Assistant Professor in the Department of History at Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where he has taught since 2008. He specializes in medieval intellectual and cultural history, historiography, and Christian-Mus lim-Jewish relations. His work has appeared in such journals as Speculum, The Haskins Society Journal, Medieval Encounters, The Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies, and Pensiero Politico Medievale. His book The Culture of Disputation in Medieval Europe, which builds on the arguments of this article, will be published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2013.
