<plain_text><page sequence="1">"STRING-PULLING" IN BIRDS. III. THE SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE IN GREENFINCHES AND CANARIES by M.A. VINCE1) (Cambridge Psychological Laboratory) (With 2 Plates and 5 Figures) (Rec. 15- VIII -I960) I. INTRODUCTION Various species of wild birds are reported to be able to pull up strings on which food is suspended. This work has been reviewed and discussed by THORPE (I956). THORPE considered that this behaviour might result from a combination of insight learning, tool using behaviour and an innate behaviour pattern. ALTEVOGT (I953) concluded from observations made on blue tits (Parus caeruleus) that string-pulling is based exclusively on an innate be- haviour pattern involving use of the foot. Previous papers by the writer have considered individual differences in "string-pulling" behaviour first in a group of adult wild great tits, Parus major (VINCE, I956) and secondly in groups of greenfinches, canaries and chaffinches (Chloris chloris, Serinus and Fringilla coelebs) of various ages (VINCE, 1958). In the first paper it was suggested that those birds which did not succeed in pulling up the string and obtaining the bait failed because their response to the string and bait became extinguished. In the second it was shown that juveniles were more successful than adults, that success was cor- related with the amount of time spent by the individual in responding to the string andfor bait, and that the superiority of the juveniles was due in part to extinction being less stable in their case than in that of the adults. The present paper is a continuation of the second, considers the same ex- periments with largely the same groups of finches, and represents an attempt to analyse the manner in which successful string-pulling behaviour develops in individual birds. i) This work has been supported throughout by the Medical Research Council. The problem and experimental design are both largely those of Dr W. H. THORPE, F.R.S. to whose help, encouragement and discussion of the problems of individual learning in birds I am greatly indebted.</page><page sequence="2">104 M. A. VINCE II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE The procedure is the same as that described in part 2 of this series (VINCE, I958), but some birds have been omitted and a few added. First, the chaf- finches described earlier have been omitted as none succeeded in the string- pulling situation. One control group of canaries which was prevented from pulling up the string is considered only briefly, and one juvenile has been added to the experimental group. The birds now to be considered are I8 greenfinches, of which six were wild trapped adults, five were aviary- reared juveniles tested between eight and twenty-six weeks of age, and seven were hand-reared juveniles tested when between seven and eight weeks old; and also sixteen domestic canaries of the Border strain, of which six were tested as adults, and ten as juveniles between fifteen and twenty-two weeks old.

They were given a few days in the flights to settle down before testing began. They were not deprived of food or water either before or during the test period, but chickweed (Stellaria media), the food used as bait during the experimental trials, was not given to the birds except in the experimental apparatus. The apparatus used was that described by THORPE (1956) and is shown in Fig. I. It consisted of a horizontal perch 12" long, fixed to a retort stand. in Fig. i. It consisted of a horizontal perch 12" long, fixed to a retort stand.</page><page sequence="3">"STRING-PULLING" IN BIRDS. 105 A piece of red string 4" long was attached to the top of the perch (nol looped over the perch and fastened at the side as in THORPE'S experiment (1956)) by a drawing pin and suspended inside a vertical glass cylinder on top of which the perch rested. A clamp holding the glass cylinder made a second perch parallel with and 7" below the first. A small piece of chickweed provided the bait and was attached to the free end of the string. The glass cylinder was used to prevent the bird from snatching directly at the bait. The experimental period was divided into three parts. Of these only the first two were described in the previous paper. The first was an initial training period when the bird was repeatedly given chickweed on the ex- perimental perch. The second was the test period with chickweed suspended from the perch on the end of the string; this consisted of one half-hour trial a day for twelve days or until the bird succeeded in pulling up the string or failed to approach the experimental apparatus for two consecutive days. This test period was reduced in the case of four hand-reared greenfinches to six days and in the case of one juvenile canary to seven days. The third period was a training period for those birds which failed to pull up the string during the test trials: the birds were first presented with the bait on the end of a piece of red string I" long, so that they could feed without pulling it up. When the bird fed readily in this way, or after three trials, a string I" or /2" longer than the last was given until the bird succeeded in pulling up 6" strings. When a bird failed to take the bait, either directly, or after first pulling up the string, it was given more practice with a string length I" shorter than the last. One bird failed to learn during the training trials although it succeeded in pulling up strings up to 3Y2" in length. No attempt was made to train one of the adult greenfinches and one of the adult canaries. Three juvenile greenfinches died before the training trials were carried out. Birds which succeeded in pulling up the 4" string during the test trials were given a number of practice trials with strings of that length, followed by further practice with 5" and 6" strings. III. RESULTS Part of the results have already been described. These will now be sum- marised very briefly. First of all, the number of birds which succeeded in pulling up the string and obtaining the bait during the test trials varied from one group to another: no adult was successful, all juvenile canaries succeeded on at least some test trials, one aviary- and two hand-reared juvenile greenfinches were successful. Secondly, the juvenile groups spent a much greater proportion of each test trial perched on the experimental apparatus, i.e., in the neighbourhood of the 8*</page><page sequence="4">b-1 0 TABLE I Summary of results in test and training trials. 1 2 3 4. 5 6 Age at be- No. of training Predominant method Predominant method No. of trials (out Greenfinches ginningof Result in 12 test trials before bird appeared during during IO trials of ten) in which test trials trials pulled up a 6" string training with: with 6" string method was used Adult wild I failed 2I 3" string pulls or lifts string, then IO nibbles to bait. 2 - Extinguished on 26 2" 2 or 3 pulls, holding loops 8 IIth trial with foot. 3 failed 37 3" lifts string, then nibbles Io to bait. 4 - Extinguished on 36 3 pulls, then I-5 pulls hold- 8 12th trial ing loop with foot. 5 failed 42 2" pulls, then nibbles to bait. 7 6 - Extinguished on not included in 4th trial testing Aviary reared I - 22 Pulled up on trials I8 3" nibbles along string to bait.

VINCE string and bait, although not always responding to it, than did the adults. Thirdly, although the time spent in this way by each individual diminished as the half-hour test period continued, this diminution tended to be sustained more stably in adults than in juveniles: during the twelve days of testing the adults tended to become extinguished, whereas the juveniles did not. The main concern in the present paper is to find elements leading to suc- cess in the behaviour of each bird during the test period, and the subsequent training period; the birds will be considered first in their 6 groups (Table I), secondly the successful behaviour of the 6 juvenile canaries during the test trials will be described and thirdly the behaviour of the 5 adult canaries during the training period. A. BEHAVIOUR OF GREENFINCHES AND CANARIES IN TEST TRIALS A difficulty arises here, in that the string-pulling situation is complex and this complexity is more apparent when testing finches, than when testing tits: ALTEVOGT for example, considered in a brood of blue tits that the string- pulling habit depended on an innate feeding pattern involving use of the feet. The tits pulled up a loop of string, held it with a foot, pulled up another loop and so on. A similar pattern has almost always developed in a group of great tits tested by the writer and similar results are described by THORPE (I956, I959). The ease with which tits can make this response must be associated with the fact that they almost invariably hold food with the feet when feeding. Finches, however, having relatively heavy beaks, take seeds into their beaks and dehusk them there. In general canaries and greenfinches do not hold food with their feet although it is true that some individuals may do so, for example some of the canaries tested in the present experiments used a foot to hold small pieces of chickweed against the perch while eating them. This manner of feeding, however, was not habitual, was not observed in all the canaries, and appeared to occur even less frequently in the greenfinches. Presumably as a result of this innate-because at least partly structural- difference between the species the finches succeeded in pulling up the string in many more different ways than do tits. Two of the most common methods are illustrated in Plate VI, and there were others. These individual differ- ences make the results difficult to summarise and for this reason they are given individually in Table I. The birds are grouped here according to species, age and method of rearing. In the first column the ages of juveniles, where this was known exactly, are given to the nearest week at the beginning of the test period. In the second column each bird's performance during the twelve test trials is characterised briefly. When a bird gave up responding (did not alight</page><page sequence="7">(71 -4 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Methods of succesful string pulling.

IO9 on the experimental perch or clamp) for two successive trials testing came to an end and the performance is described as "extinguished". When a bird continued to respond in some way, but still did not succeed in pulling up the string its performance is described as "failed" in column 2. When the bird succeeded in pulling up the string and obtaining the bait this is indicated in column 2 and the numbers of trials in which the bird was successful are also noted. This was essential as a bird which was successful on one occasion did not always pull up the string on subsequent trials. The third column indicates what happened during the training period. The birds were all trained successfully except one whose response to string and bait had a tendency to become extinguished, and which was abandoned when after 37 training trials it ceased to respond at all to a 3X2" string. The figures given for training in column 3 indicate the number of training trials given each bird before it succeeded in pulling up a 6" string. The fifth column in Table I gives a brief indication of the string-pulling method used by each bird during its first ten trials with a 6" string and the preceding column indicates at what stage this method appeared. Only the first attempt at each trial is considered in column 5. Sometimes the bird used more than one method, it was indeed rare for a bird to approach the string in exactly the same way on successive trials. The final column there- fore gives some indication of whether each bird's method was a stable one, by giving the number of trials out of ten in which it was used. The pre- dominant methods were two, and are those illustrated in the Plates. The bird pulled a loop of string over the perch and held it with a foot before making another pull on the string, or the bird nibbled along the string until it reached the bait. The ten adult birds all used one of these methods or a combination of the two. The juveniles, however, behaved in a less uniform fashion. Only one used the loop + foot method, and eight used the nibbling along method; the remaining five used a variety of methods which tended to become recognisable for the individual, although perhaps never entirely stable. One method was to lift the string again and again until it caught on the perch or the top of the glass cylinder and the bait could be reached. A variant of this was to lift the string and flick the bait on to the perch or top of the cylinder, or to push the string over one or the other; in one case the bird developed a fairly stereotyped method which consisted of lifting the loop high above the perch, then hopping round and round thus twisting up the string until the bait was lifted out of the cylinder. It was noticeable that with the exception of one canary which used the loop + foot method, and one which used a foot to hold the string after it had been pulled up, no juvenile developed any stable use of the foot as its final method in string-pulling.</page><page sequence="10">110 M. A. VINCE Analysis of the development of the string-pulling capacity in finches is made confusing by the variety of their behaviour, and by the fact that much of it is fairly undifferentiated. In particular the juveniles in the early stages tended to give the impression that they were m u d d i n g a b o u t with the string, and a successful response might develop out of a lot of pulling, lifting and pushing or nibbling at it: fairly indefinite patterns which merge into each other. For this reason it seems desirable to take one TABLE II Use of the foot in test and training trials.

III unmistakeable feature of their behaviour, which appeared to the observer to be a definite help towards making a successful response, and to con- sider the variations in frequency of its occurrence in the different groups and its relation with success. Use of the foot in holding the string was the most easily distinguishable pattern and will be considered in detail. Table II shows the frequency of occurrence of the use of the foot during the test and subsequent training trials. To consider the test trials first: none of the adults tested were success- ful during these trials and none used a foot to hold the string during the test period, although five out of ten consistently learned to use the foot later on during the training period. Of the juveniles, all canaries made at least occasional use of the foot during the test trials, although none did so on all trials. The relatively frequent use of the foot by juvenile canaries is the more remarkable as only one of the six finally came to use a string- pulling method which necessarily involved the foot. Very occasional use of the foot was recorded in the juvenile greenfinches which again did not develop string-pulling methods involving the foot. In Table II, the frequency with which the foot was used in training trials is indicated by a mean of the number of times the foot was used in trials with each string length, this method being necessitated by the fact that the amount of training and hence number of trials with each string length varied with the success of each individual. These results suggest, again, that canaries used the foot more readily than greenfinches, but the situation with regard to age was reversed: in the training trials juveniles used the feet 1 es s frequently than adults. They were in fact developing (or had already developed) methods which did not require the foot. Hence the use of the foot decreased slightly in all three sets of juveniles between trials with a 5" and a 6" string, whereas in the two groups of adults it increased gradually up to and including the trials with a 6" string. This last finding is perhaps very much to be expected but taken on its own the tendency of juveniles, and particularly juvenile canaries in the test trials to use the feet so frequently and with so little effect is less easy to understand. To provide a measure of control here it was decided to consider the frequency of the use of the foot in relation to all other types of behaviour in the experimental situation. For this reason the different ways in which the birds behaved during the test trials were enumerated and are given in Table III. Here all types of behaviour noted while the bird was standing on the experimental perch or clamp have been included. Previously (VINCE, I958) when scoring the bird's behaviour in this experimental situation the main score was simply</page><page sequence="12">112 M. A.

This score was of course crude as although the bird was then in the neighbourhood of the string and bait it was not necessarily responding to it. At this stage, however, it was not considered justifiable to omit behaviour which did not bring the bird into actual contact with the stringjbait situation. Certain types of "irrelevant" behaviour such as preening, bill-wiping or sleeping might well be "displacement reactions" induced by the string-pulling situation, and so indirectly responses to it. Also it was not always possible to distinguish between behaviour which represented a direct response to the string-pulling situation and behaviour which did not. Any attempt to make a complete distinction between these two types of behaviour must in any case border on the subjective or anthropomorphic; for example if the bird nibbles at the drawing pin it is easy to imagine it is trying to pull it out, but there is no evidence that the pin is connected f or t h e bird in any way with the string-pulling problem. For this reason all behaviour which occurred while the bird was on the experimental perch or clamp, or fluttering round the glass cylinder, has been included in Table III. The behaviour is here divided into two cate- gories; the first including those activities (like pulling on the string) which could lead to success in string-pulling, and the second those (like fluttering round the glass cylinder), which could not be successful. The opportunities for behaviour of the second type are clearly greater than for those of the first type.</page><page sequence="13">"STRING-PULLING) IN BIRDS.

The present analysis of the same data shows that this more prolonged response of the juveniles included a greater variety of behaviour than did that of the adults. This greater variety included more behaviour which was likely to lead to success, as well as more behaviour which was irrelevant to the string-pulling situation. This varied behaviour of the juveniles makes is easier to understand (I) why juveniles were the more successful in the test trials (2) why their string-pulling methods were the more varied and (3) why a key feature like the use of the foot appeared most frequently in the test trials of the juveniles. There is, however, a further point about this greater variety of juvenile behaviour. It could follow simply from the greater length of time spent by juveniles in responding, the greater length of time giving greater oppor- tunity for variety. One way of investigating this point is to pick out in- dividual test trials including particular amounts of activity and thus to compare the variety of behaviour of adults and juveniles during comparable periods of time. For this purpose test trials including between Ioo and 200 and between 200 and 300 seconds of activity in greenfinches and canaries, and also trials including between 300 and 400 seconds of activity in canaries only, were considered, as outside these ranges the number of trials which could be included was negligeable either for adults or for juveniles. The figures are given in Table IV, where means are given for each group of birds. Where the total variety of behaviour is considered this is always TABLE IV Number of types of activity occurring during comparable periods of time in adult and juvenile finches.

In the second category it is true except for greenfinches which responded for between 200 and 300 seconds. On the whole, there- fore, it looks as if the juveniles are likely to run through a greater variety of activities than the adults in a comparable period of time. The question which now arises is whether the greater amount and variety of behaviour expended by the juveniles is sufficient to explain their supe- riority in the string-pulling situation. Or did they in addition adapt more readily than the adults in the experimental situation? One way of testing this is to re-examine the data given in Figs 3 a and b and express the variety of activity which is likely to lead to success as a percentage of the total for each group in each trial. This is given in Figs 4 a and b. If this percentage increases over the test period it will show that behaviour likely to succeed increased at the expense of behaviour which could not succeed; the performance, in a sense, would be improving, in spite of the tendency towards extinction. Fig. 4 shows that the performance of all groups tested with string did show signs of improvement in this respect and the group tested with wire did not, in fact could not show any such increase in successful behaviour. The important point here is that these 'learning curves' occur both in the juvenile groups where birds were successful, and in the adult groups where no bird succeeded, and hence where the activity was not reinforced by feeding. Therefore it looks as if the juveniles' superiority stemmed mainly from the greater intensity of their response. Finally in respect to types of activity these data were considered as a test for the existence of insight. For this purpose only birds which were successful during the test trials were relevant (three juvenile green- finches and six juvenile canaries). The number of types of activity oc- curring in the trial before the first successful trial, during the successful trial and in the first post-successful trial were averaged for each group. It was considered that if the bird pulled up the string because it perceived the relation between string and bait this would cause all types of activity, but especially irrelevant activity to decrease in the succeeding trial. Fig. 5 shows that this was not the case. B. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE IN SIX JUVENILE CANARIES The behaviour of one group during the test trials will now be considered in detail.

On the third trial responded from the clamp for several minutes, then from the perch; pulled or lifted string, but immediately afterwards, hopped down to the clamp and looked at bait or pecked at the glass (a direct response resulting from the movement of the bait?). In the fifth trial pulled aind nibbled at the string, pulled the bait out and ate from the clamp. In the next began nibbling along the string, once nibbled nearly to the bait, then nibbled back to the drawing pini; finally successful. In trial 7 pulled up almost immediately: nibbled along the string until the bait rested on top of the glass cylinder, continued to nibble at the string, and bait dropped down again, but put a foot on the string and was able to reach bait.

In trial Io pulled a loop over the perch, and the bait on top of the glass cylinder in 30 seconds. Unsuccessful in trials i and 12.</page><page sequence="20">120 M. A. VINCE No. 2. At first responded mainly from the clamp, or by lifting up the string while on perch. On the third trial pulled a loop over the perch, put a foot on it and ate the chick- weed. On the fourth repeated this, without using a foot and ate from the clamp. On the fifth the string was flicked over the perch as the bird hopped down to the floor, took the bait and ate with both feet on the string. Unsuccessful in (6). In (7) pulled up a loop, with the bait on the edge of the glass cylinder, ate and dropped. Unsuccessful in (8), (9), (Io), (II) and (12), responding very little in these trials from perch or clamp. No. 3. In the first two trials pulled gently at the string as if eating it, lifted and nibbled at it, fluttered round the glass cylinder; twice pulled at the string, then leant down and pecked at the glass in front of the bait. On the third nibbled a loop on to the perch, then leant down, pecked at the glass. In (4) nibbled a loop on to the perch then gnawed at the pin, lifted the string until the bait was on the edge of the glass and ate. In (5) repeatedly lifted and nibbled at the string, then leant down and pecked at the glass, also repeatedly put a loop on the perch, where it stayed until the string was nibbled again. Finally put a foot on the loop and ate. After that responded continuously. on each trial until successful. No. 4. Spent most of first two trials responding from the clamp. In the third pulled, nibbled at and lifted the string, but six times went immediately afterwards to the clamp to peck at the bait behind the glass. Did the same repeatedly in trial (4), finally lifted and nibbled at the string, finishing with a foot on the string and the bait outside the cylinder. Ate from the clamp. Again in (5) and (6) after causing the string to move hopped down to peck at the glass in front of the bait. Once managed to get a loop of string over the perch, then nibbled at the s t ring when could have taken the bait. Similarly once got a loop over the perch and proceeded to peck at the outside of the cylinder when the bait was easily obtainable. (7), (8) and (9) similar. In (9) pulled a loop over the perch with the bait on top of the glass, then nibbled at the s t r i n g and the bait dropped back inside the cylinder. This repeated in (Io) then pulled a loop over the perch and took the bait, dropped it outside, again nibbled a loop over the perch, nibbled at the string, and pulled the bait on to the perch. Ate from the clamp. In (12) lifted the string, nibbled along it, flicked the bait out of the glass cylinder, pulled at the string. Ate seeds on the floor, and finally ate the bait from the clamp. No. 5. In the first two trials pecked, nibbled at and lifted the string intermittently. On two occasions pecked or pulled at the string then looked at the bait through the glass. On the third and fourth trial responded vigorously from the clamp, as well as from the perch, then gradually gave up responding. In (5) responded continuously from the perch or the clamp and after Io minutes flicked the bait out of the glass cylinder and ate, holding the string with a foot. After this responded vigorously and variously from perch or clamp on each trial until successful. No. 6. (I) For 9 minutes gave signs of avoiding the string, then pecked or pulled at it. In next two trials pecked and pulled and nibbled intermittently at the string. In (4) responded continuously, but tended to pull up the string and then lean down and peck at the outside of the glass cylinder. After 8 minutes the bait was flicked out. In (5) re- peatedly lifted the string and put a loop on the perch. Again flicked the bait out after 20 minutes and ate with both feet on the string. In the next two trials was unsuccessful, and made no use of the foot; pecked at or lifted the string, and put loops on the perch, or responded from the clamp. The above account of each bird's behaviour in the test situation is brief, and takes account only of those elements which appeared to be of signif-</page><page sequence="21">"STRING-PULLING" IN BIRDS. 121 icance to the observer, i.e., the description omits much pulling, lifting, and nibbling at the string as well as most of the responses from the clamp. It is clear, however, that the situation is a difficult one in that the most direct approach to the bait led the birds again and again away from a solution of the string-pulling problem. The direct approach to the bait caused them to approach it from the clamp where it was unobtainable until the problem was solved, and also the kind of activity which might lead to success might itself divert the bird's behaviour: when the string was made to move the bird tended to drop it and approach the bait from the clamp, or lean down and peck at the glass cylinder. In general the birds' behaviour suggested strongly that pulling or nibbling at the string was not necessarily connected with the bait which might be made to approach as a result of this activity: they tended to nibble at the string and to go on doing this for long periods, frequently pulling small pieces off it, and on some occasions appearing to eat them. This activity is presumably related to the "de-husking" of seeds, part of the finches' normal feeding behaviour. It happened more than once that a bird pulled up the string so that the bait was lodged well within reach, and then continued to pull or nibble at the string. Another point which emerges from these records is that success did not imply a final solution to the string-pulling problem; only two of the six birds (nos.

TRAINING TRIALS WITH FIVE ADULT CANARIES The training trials proceeded on rather more predictable lines and may be summarised more easily. The birds concerned were older, and the situation simpler in the sense that the changes in it (the lengthening of the string) were made systematically by the experimenter and so depended less on the previous activity of the individual bird. Adult canary no. I was not included in the training trials. No. 2. With the I" string went at once to the perch, took and ate the bait. 2" string: (I) went to the perch and pecked at outside of glass cylinder, then pecked inside and took the bait, (2) lifted the s t r in g for the first time, but in (3) went directly for the bait again. 3" string: (I) went to the clamp and pecked at the glass; activity becomes interspersed with eating seeds. Later lifted string from the perch, but again took the bait directly. (2) pulled and pecked glass then put a foot on the string for the first time (3) looked again at first from the clamp, but finally lifted string from the perch and dropped the bait outside the cylinder, finished feeding with a foot on the string. In extra practice with a 3" and 3/2" string did much lifting and pulling of the string and finally ate with a foot on the string. 4" string: the use of the foot began to come in earlier, but never immediately on first lifting the string, then (extra practice with a 4/2" string) began to lift up a loop and put a foot on it, then take another loop. This was repeated without any real setback during trials with a 5" and 6" string. No. 3. I" string: took bait at once, and in two out of three trials ate with a foot on the string. 2" string: in each trial lifted the string, put a foot on it and ate the chickweed. 3" string: (2) lifted the string several times, put a foot on it, pecked at the glass; repeated this and then ate the bait. In (2) and (3) lifted the string and ate chick- weed with a foot in it, but the pattern still slow and clumsy. 4" string: lifted up a loop, put a foot on it, lifted another loop and held with foot etc.; this pattern repeated throughout trials with a 5" and 6" string, although mostly made a first attempt without using the foot. No. 4. i" string: ate chickweed immediately, with a foot on the string. 2" string: again took bait each time, and ate with a foot on the string, but use of foot not always immediate. 3" string: (I) lifted the s t r in g immediately (and continued to do so on all subsequent trials), rather ineffective use of the foot. (2) after lifting the string hlopped about, looked at the bait through the glass, and pecked and clawed at the glass from the clamp. Finally ate from the perch with one claw on the string. (3) lifted string three times, then held it with a foot and ate the bait. 4" string: during the next 12 trials gradually developed an effective use of the loop and foot method, with little variation except the occasional omission of the foot.

Unsuzcessful in five minute test. Given extra practice with a 2" and 2/2" string. Gradually eliminated tendency to pull string then look at bait through the glass, and began to nibble along the string to the bait. Given 6 extra trials with a 3" then 3,/2" string; responded with a mixture of lifting, pulling then peering at bait through glass, and nibbling along the string; frequently dropped it. With 4", 5" and 6" strings developed the nibbling along method, preceded by lifting or pulling at the string. Frequently dropped it and had to begin again. On one occasion nibbled along string in the wrong direction. No. 6. I" string: in (I) and (3) took bait directly and ate with a foot on the bait, in (2) lifted the string and nibbled along it to the bait. 2" string: successful by lifting the string and nibbling along to the bait, but on the first occasion only after much irrelevant activity, such as peering through the glass cylinder, flying round and so on. On two occasions ate with a foot on the bait. Lifted, nibbled along string and ate with a foot on the bait in 3", 4" and 5" trials. 6" string: successful using same method, but slow and clumsy, frequently dropped the string, sometimes nibbled along it in the wrong direction. In the training trials the birds began by taking the bait directly (it hung only just below the perch), and the transition from taking the bait directly to taking the string appeared to be effected quite easily, although sometimes lengthening the string was followed again by the direct approach to the bait, that is, by peering at it through the glass. The final solution for each bird developed fairly slowly. The success of the training trials is clearly associated with the fact that the birds were trained to respond from the perch, their activity was directed towards the strings when they were short, and this activity was reinforced by feeding. Also if one trial was unsuccess- ful, the subsequent trial was made so easy that it was reinforced; the birds were not allowed to become extinguished; also it is possible that training with the very short strings soon ensured the establishment of a stringlbait association. IV. DISCUSSION The question to be considered first is that of the type of learning in- volved in the string-pulling situation, and in particular the question of insight as this is an important issue raised in connection with it. Do the birds, in fact, pull at the string because they have perceived the relation between string and bait? Insight is defined by THORPE (1956) as the apprehension of relations, and insight learning as "the sudden production of a new adaptive response not arrived at by trial and error behaviour, or the solution of a problem by the sudden adaptive reorganisation of ex- perience". In favour of the insight hypothesis is the single fact that although the birds were nearest to the bait when standing on the clamp they all did at</page><page sequence="24">I24 M. A. VINCE some stage alight on the perch and pull at the string; they did so frequently in the early stages of testing and tended to do so as soon as, or sometimes before the bait ceased to be directly available in the series of training trials. This point will be discussed later as a number of findings described in the previous section are against this hypothesis. Against it first is the age effect. It would not be easy to explain why juveniles reared and kept under relatively restricted conditions should have shown more insight than adults, and particularly adults like the greenfinches, which had been reared in the wild. Again the fact that success was associated with a greater variety and duration of activity in the test situation points to a type of trial and error, rather than insight learning. More direct evidence against the insight hypothesis is the fact that success did not occur suddenly; improvement was gradual. Moreover, it was inter- mittent; only two of the six juvenile canaries learned in any final sense although all were occasionally successful (Table V). This was also the case in training trials with the adult canaries; improvement was gradual, and success could be followed by failure, even before the string was lengthened. As an example of gradual learning bird no. 2 tended at first (e.g., with 3" and 3'2" strings) to get the string over the perch after much pulling and lifting, then to feed with a foot on the string, later the use of the foot began to appear earlier in each trial, and thus to help in pulling up the string; bird no. 5 succeeded through the gradual elimination of a tendency to respond to the bait directly, by pecking at the glass either from perch or clamp. In general each bird's method of dealing with the string-pulling situation developed rather slowly. Again, if the birds had succeeded in pulling up the string because they perceived the relation between string and bait, subsequent trials might have been expected to contain fewer types of activity, while there was in fact a slight increase in activity after the first successful trial. Activities which could have provided the basis for a successful solution occurred again and again; for example, juvenile canaries frequently used a foot to hold the string during the test trials, sometimes successfully, but again, this behaviour usually occurred intermittently and was never followed by what could be construed as a sudden solution of the string-pulling problem. The accounts of the behaviour of individuals in the test trials are not more encouraging for the insight hypothesis. There was evidence that the birds did not perceive the string-bait relationship. They behaved repeatedly in ways which indicated a lack of insight. Examples of this are nibbling along the string nearly to the bait, then back towards the point of attach- ment by the drawing pin; pulling at the string, then hopping down to the</page><page sequence="25">"STRING-PULLING" IN BIRDS. 125 clamp and pecking at the glass in the neighbourhood of the bait, or leaning down to peer at it through the glass. The simplest explanation of this type of behaviour would be that a pull on the string caused the bait to move, the moving bait becoming a more intense stimulus which would induce a direct response, i.e., movement of the bird towards it. Again, it was not unusual for a bird to peck and pull a loop of string over the perch so that the bait was actually available, then continue to peck or nibble at the string until the chickweed dropped back into the glass cylinder. Here the birds appeared to be nibbling at the string for its own sake. The case for insight is a poor one and must rest, indeed, on the single fact that the birds pulled at the string and did not go immediately to the clamp and remain there in the vicinity of the bait. There could, however, be simpler explanations of their pulling at the string: firstly, they were given many training trials with chickweed on the experimental perch before the test trials began and the sight of chickweed may thus have become a signal for going to the perch (only five birds, four greenfinches and one canary, went first to the clamp on test trial I). Secondly the string was a strange object, and would be investigated as such. Thirdly, there is the effect of the bait being caused to move, when the bird pulled or nibbled at the string; their tendency to lean down and peer at the bait immediately after pulling at the string suggests that the movement increased the in- tensity of this stimulus, and in this way it may have provided a measure of reinforcement for the bird's response to the string thus causing it to be repeated. In the training trials the bait was at first close to the perch although suspended on a short string, therefore approach to the bait brought the birds into contact with the string and the approach was in this case always reinforced by feeding. A conditioned connection between string and bait might therefore be established in the early trials. Later when the length of the string was increased and the birds pulled at that rather than making directly for the bait this change could be attributed to insight or to conditioning. In one or two cases where the bird stopped responding to the string after it had been lengthened and reverted to a direct response to the bait we have evidence of a lack of insight-for example had bird no 2 pulled at a 2" string because it perceived the connection between string and bait it could be expected to do the same with a 3" string. However, in this connection the case for or against insight cannot be considered with- out more evidence, and it might be dealt with more satisfactorily in a species, such as the great tit, which is more adept in the use of the foot. It is clear that many of the reasons for discarding the concept of insight in connection with string-pulling in these finches are also reasons for in-</page><page sequence="26">126 M. A. VINCE cluding this behaviour in the category of trial-and-error learning (LLOYD MORGAN, I894, THORNDIKE, I898). THORPE who, in a recent paper recon- sidering string-pulling behaviour has placed it in this category (THORPE, I959), defines trial-and-error learning in a way which makes it identical with the "conditioned reflex type 2" of KONORSKI (KONORSKI, I948): in the course of appetitive behaviour an association is formed between an independent motor action and a stimulus or situation when both are followed by reinforcement. The finches' behaviour described above was consistent with this type of concept. Features illustrating this are (I) the age effect, where the greater success of the juveniles was associated with a greater amount and variety of behaviour in the experimental situation, (2) the tendency for a first successful trial to be followed by an increase in variety of activity (Fig. 5), and (3) as long as the sight and movement of the bait can be considered as secondary reinforcement, the improvement shown in the birds' behaviour during those trials preceding a successful trial can also be con- sidered in terms of trial-and-error learning. The results described above may now be considered more comprehen- sively within the PAVLOV/KONORSKI framework, together with problems arising from these results which demand further experiment. The situation is typical of the tradition trial-and-error or insight situa- tions: the bait is visible, but the way to it is blocked. In a sense the way to the bait is double blocked in the present situation: the direct approach to the bait is prevented by the glass, and the indirect approach by way of pulling at the string had the effect of causing the bait to move, and the bird, thus stimulated, to go back to the direct approach. As a result the test trials produce a complex process of adaptation in which various factors are balanced against each other. The balance changes throughout the series and it varies between groups. The birds were given preliminary training with chickweed on the perch before testing began and were not tested until they came down to feed almost immediately on its being placed there. Therefore when the string and bait are first presented it is reasonable to assume that the birds come down to the experimental apparatus because they are stimulated in part by the bait; an investigatory approach to the string is, however, also to be expected. But we do not know whether the birds would have responded so continuously to the string had the bait not been attached, nor whether their initial investigatory response was the more intense because of the close proximity of the bait. These points can be investigated more fully. For some reason-and this is another point which requires full investigation-the response to the string and/or</page><page sequence="27">"STRING-PULLING" IN BIRDS. 127 bait is more intense in the juveniles than in the adults. The response to the bait is blocked and the string/bait response becomes inhibited in a manner already described (VINCE, 1956, I958); this inhibition has also been shown to be more stable in the adults than in the juveniles (VINCE, I958). Assuming the presence of internal inhibition the question is raised of whether this could be the reason why the birds frequently ignored the bait when it did become available as a result of their nibbling and pulling at the string, and this presents a further problem which should be investigated. The presence of string and bait, each having some value as a stimulus, compli- cates the situation and therefore it is simpler now to consider the response to the string, what has been described above as activity likely to lead to success in string pulling. If the initial activity directed towards the string is suffi- ciently intense as in the juveniles and is not side-tracked into 'de-husking' activity, this will almost certainly be reinforced by the movement of the bait and increase, but if it is not sufficiently intense this too will be inhibited as in the adults. However, even then the response to the string died away more slowly than other types of activity and there occurs a rather delicate shift between relevant and irrelevant activity, ending in signs of improve- ment even in those birds, such as the adult greenfinches, which clearly would never have pulled up the string. Given these factors it seems possible to understand how the adults should have improved in their performance even while it was dying away, while in the juveniles, given their more intense initial response, the same factors should have operated to produce success. The finding of most general significance is probably that showing the greater intensity of activity in the juveniles, as compared with adult birds of the same species. This may well be a general characteristic of young animals and has been demonstrated in rats (WATSON, I903, RICHTER, 1922, SLONAKER, I912). WATSON'S work also suggests that the behaviour of young rats is more varied than that of the adults. Does this mean that a stimulus will produce a response of greater intensity in a young than in an older animal? And if so, why? It has been suggested that the decline in activity after the juvenile stage is associated with an increase in the stability of internal inhibition, which could produce a channelling or damping of activity in older animals, and also that this greater stability of internal inhibition depends at least partly on practice or variety of experience (VINCE, I960). There is no suggestion as to how the increase in activity takes place during the first few weeks or months of life. Is this also the effect of experience? Undoubtedly by a simple process of conditioning the number of significant stimuli is bound to increase rapidly during the first few weeks or months</page><page sequence="28">I28 M. A. VINCE of life. It is interesting that in the passerine birds studied the increase in activity occurs after full growth has been attained, while in the rat it occurs while the animals are growing; this suggests that it is not solely connected with a possible increase in vigour due to growth. V. SUMMARY I. Eighteen greenfinches, of which six were wild trapped adults, five were aviary- reared juveniles and seven were hand-reared juveniles; and also sixteen domestic canaries of which six were adults and ten were juveniles were tested in a "string-pulling" situation. 2. The experiment consisted of (I) a training period when birds were fed repeatedly at the point on a perch where the string and bait were to be suspended; (2) a test period when birds were given up to twelve half-hour trials with the bait suspended on a 4" string; and (3) for those birds which failed in the test period, a period of training in string-pulling. Half the juveniles tested were successful in string-pulling, but none of the adults. 3. Results showed that the finches used more varied methods of pulling up the string than do other species (e.g., tits) which habitually use the feet in feeding. It was also shown that the methods used by juveniles tended to be more varied than those of adults. 4. To this greater variety of behaviour is in part imputed the greater success of the juveniles in the string-pulling situation; this factor is, however, considered to be additional to those previously reported: that juveniles spent a greater proportion of each test trial in responding to the string and/or bait, and a diminished tendency to become extinguished in comparison with adults. 5. The way in which behaviour developed throughout the test trials was adaptive in the sense that activity which was reinforced (e.g., by the movement of the bait following a pull on the string) tended in general to increase at the expense of unreinforced activity. 6. Consideration of individual performances during the test and training trials sug- gested that the birds showed no evidence of insight into the nature of the experimental situation; success tended to occur intermittently and the improvement in performance was on the whole gradual. This suggested that the performance is closer to "trial-and- error" than to insight learning. VI. REFERENCES ALTEVOGT, R. (I953). fber das ,,Sch6pfen" einiger V6gelarten. - Behaviour 4, p. I47-I53.
