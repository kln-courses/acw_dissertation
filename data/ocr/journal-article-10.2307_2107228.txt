<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. XLVII, No. 4, June I987 Nietzsche's Theory of Truth and Belief ROBERT NOLA University of Auckland The thesis of this paper is that, on the whole, Nietzsche operated with two theories of truth, a correspondence and a pragmatic theory, the pragmatic theory of truth being derivative from a more fundamental pragmatic theory of belief. A version of the correspondence theory is presupposed in Nietzsche's claim that his conception of the world as a matrix of forces and powers is a true account of how the world really is. It is also presup- posed in his claim that our quite ordinary beliefs that there are enduring things, objects or bits of matter or material is an illusion or error, i.e., these ordinary beliefs are false. Since the world is just a matrix of forces and powers there can be no such items. However Nietzsche alleges that since we are creatures that have evolved with certain sensory organs and intellectual capacities that enable us to form beliefs, then there must have been some life-preserving utility in having beliefs that such items exist (despite the alleged falsity of such beliefs). Beliefs in such items, Nietzsche claims, can have pragmatic value but they are no guide to how the world really is. Since most pragmatists do not openly admit that pragmatically held beliefs are false, Nietzsche is not so much a pragmatist about truth as a pragmatist about belief. Nietzsche does not normally tell us which theory of truth he is using when he employs words such as "true," "false" (and their cognates) or such words as "error," and "illusion." In particular, he talks of truths in the context of his pragmatic theory of truth and/or belief when these "truths" are often regarded by him as false claims (in the correspondence sense of the theory of truth). This can lead to much ambiguity and para- dox. Consider the remark: "Truth is the kind of error without which a certain species of life could not live. The value for life is ultimately deci- sive" (WP ?493).' The first word "truth" occurs with reference to the pragmatic theory and means something like "those beliefs we normally I All references to WP are to numbered sections of F.

The sixth word "error" occurs with reference to the cor- respondence theory of truth and means the same as "false." Thus the remark really says more prosaically: "Those beliefs we normally take to be true are really false but without these beliefs we could not live." Nietzsche in fact says just this elsewhere in The Will to Power: ". . . a belief can be a condition of life and nonetheless be false" (WP 5483). Thus Nietzsche's shocking claim to have discovered that falsity, not truth, is necessary for life: "But my truth is terrible; for so far one has called lies truth. Many interpreters of Nietzsche have been misled, by the style in which Nietzsche presents his remarks, into supposing that Nietzsche rejected any kind of realist theory of truth, such as the correspondence theory, and adopted a non-realist theory of truth such as the pragmatic theory. Against these interpretations it will be maintained that Nietzsche adopts both but each separately in their respective domains of application. One important task in interpreting Nietzsche is to discover into which domain his cryptic remarks about truth and falsity fall. In general, with respect to the framework of ordinary everyday belief and most of science the prag- matic theory of truth is central while the correspondence theory is periph- eral. With respect to his theory about how the world is Nietzsche adopts a correspondence theory of truth and the pragmatic theory has no role at all. Without a realist correspondence theory of truth remarks such as the following lose all force: Something might be true while being harmful and dangerous in the highest degree. Indeed, it might be a basic characteristic of existence that those who would know it completely would perish, in which case the strength of a spirit should be measured according to how much of the "truth" one could still barely endure - or to put it more clearly, to what degree one would require it to be thinned down, shrouded, sweetened, blunted, falsified. (BGE 539) Or, as he says elsewhere: "A thinker is now that being in whom the impulse for truth and those life-preserving errors clash for their first fight. . . . Compared to the significance of this fight, everything else is a matter of indifference" (GS 5 1 I1).4 To abandon either of the two theories F.

Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans- lated by W. Kaufmann (New York: Random House, Vintage Books, 1974). Similar remarks to the last two quotations can be found scattered throughout Nietzsche's pub- lished work. Thus in The Antichrist S50 we find: "At every step one has to wrestle for truth; one has had to surrender for it almost everything to which the heart, to which our 5z6 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="3">of truth mentioned above is to render these remarks meaningless. In fact the exclusive adoption of the pragmatic theory of truth is explicitly ruled out by Nietzsche: "That it does not matter whether a thing is true, but only what effects it produces - absolute lack of integrity" (WP S 172). However such a remark seems to run counter to the following: "How is truth proved? By the feeling of enhanced power - by utility - by indis- pensibility - in short, by advantages. . . ." But immediately after this Nietzsche adds: "But that is a prejudice: a sign that truth is not involved at all -" (WP 4 5 ). Such remarks seem bewildering or downright perverse if the appropriate context for each is not provided by the interpreter when Nietzsche, as is all too common, fails to provide any context himself. In fact it is a stylistic device of his published works that his remarks are couched in a deliberately strikingly paradoxical way; it is a necessary fea- ture of his notes, such as those published posthumously as The Will to Power, that his jottings are not made fully explicit by him. This paper falls into four parts. The first is an outline of Nietzsche's theory about the nature of the world, i.e., his theory that it is a matrix of disembodied non-material forces and powers. In the second part the case is made for Nietzsche's commitment to a version of the correspondence theory of truth in deciding between broad metaphysical theories such as his own and rivals such as mechanistic atomism or any substance-based or material-based theory. In the third part Nietzsche's claim that our mate- rial or substance-based ordinary mode of talk is illusory is outlined but not critically examined. Nietzsche's pragmatic theory of belief and truth with respect to our ordinary beliefs is sketched and allocated a role that still leaves room for the correspondence theory of truth to account for the alleged erroneous or illusory character of these beliefs. The final section explores Nietzsche's claim that our ordinary beliefs in the existence of things, substance, and matter are false. It will turn out that there is no sin- gle clear argument and that Nietzsche's grounds for his claim reveal some unresolved difficulties for his position. Though this paper is about Nietzsche's theory of truth the only kinds of statement that will be dis- cussed are those of ordinary and scientific discourse; no mention will be made of Nietzsche's theory of truth for logical statements, semantic state- ments, or statements from moral or aesthetic discourse. love, our trust in life, cling otherwise. That requires greatness of soul: the service of truth is the hardest service" (p. 632 of The Portable Nietzsche, selected and translated by W. Kaufmann [New York: The Viking Press, 1954]). Again in On the Geneology of Mor- als (First Essay, Si) Nietzsche says of certain "investigators and microscopists of the soul" that they may "have trained themselves to sacrifice all desirability to truth, every truth, even plain, harsh, ugly, repellent, unchristian, immoral truth. - For such truths do exist -" (see p. z5 of the pair of works translated by W. Kaufmann cited in footnote z). NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 527</page><page sequence="4">I. Nietzsche's World-Conception It has often been thought that when Nietzsche finally came to present what he called his "world-conception" (WP ? io66) it turned out that his view of the world was thoroughly Heraclitean: there is nothing but con- tinual flux - there is pure becoming but no being. The manner in which Nietzsche expresses his world-conception is derived, in part, from F. A. Lange's The History of Materialism (i865) and R. Boscovich's Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis (I763).' Boscovich had found certain difficulties in mechanics, especially the theory of impact, which he traced back to the idea that matter, especially atoms or corpuscles of matter, is impenetrable and extended in space. He proposed instead that all bits of matter are composed of a finite number of indivisible non-extended points separated by a finite but non-zero distance from each other. These points have two force properties. The first is the force due to the property of inertia pos- sessed by each point. The second is a mutual active force that each point has for every other point, the magnitude and direction of the force depending on the distance between the points; the forces may be attractive or repulsive as may be illustrated by the relation between the forces acting on the points at the end of a spring when the spring is expanded or con- tracted beyond its natural length. Using this theoretical basis Boscovich proceeds to found the entire theory of mechanics. On this theory matter is at best derivative and not in any way fundamental. Nietzsche praises Boscovich in ? i z of Beyond Good and Evil for hav- ing rid us of the idea of matter, the idea of substance, and the idea of the atom as an everlasting, indestructible, indivisible, smallest piece of mat- ter, and for replacing these by the idea of disembodied forces acting at points.7 He takes it to be his task to extend Boscovich's program to rid us entirely of the philosophical category of substance whether it be mental The influence of Lange and Boscovich on Nietzsche is convincingly argued in G. J. Stack, Lange and Nietzsche (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1983). As important as the influence of Lange and Boscovich are on Nietzsche's world-conception they are not the only significant influences; one must also take into account (amongst others) Nietzsche's acquaintance with ancient Greek philosophers and Schopenhauer. However the influence of Lange and Boscovich has not been generally acknowledged. Nietzsche's position is close to that of a materialist, but a particularly radical one in that he denies that there is even any matter. Both Lange and Boscovich provided much of the back- ground considerations for how one could be a "non-material materialist" and a thor- ough-going naturalist. 6 See R. Boscovich, A Theory of Natural Philosophy (Cambridge, Massachusetts: M.I.T. Press, I966), especially Articles 7 to io and i6i to I64. . . .Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last part of the earth that 'stood fast'- the belief in 'substance', in 'matter', in the earth-residuum and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has been gained on earth so far" (BGE si[ z). 5z8 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="5">substances, such as minds, Cartesian thinking substances or souls, or material substances such as things, objects, atoms and Kantian things-in- themselves. In proposing his world-conception Nietzsche abandoned any form of theory which required enduring indestructible items analogous to atoms of matter and proposed an alternative based on forces and powers. In this respect the language Nietzsche employs in describing his theory of the world is Boscovichian. Whether the terms 'force' and 'power' refer to the same kinds of items that Boscovich referred to is doubtful; what they do refer to is an obscure matter to be touched on shortly. Nietzsche's world-conception, as sketched in the notes collected in The Will to Power, can be summarized in the following six theses (some of which receive some necessary but by no means complete amplification). (i) Time is infinite in both directions while space is finite (WP ?Io66-67).8 (z) There is a large but finite (Nietzsche says "definite") quantity of force which is conserved (WP Sio66-67). Talk of conserva- tion suggests that this force is like mechanical force, or perhaps other forces found in physics. But we should be wary of leaping to this conclu- sion too readily and rather treat Nietzsche's talk of force in this context as primitive and undefined; subsequently it will be referred to as "Nietzsche-force" or "N-force" for short. (3) There is a large but finite (Nietzsche says "definite") number of regions of space, or centres, at which definite amounts of N-force occur, i.e., at a given region of space and at a given time a certain quantity of N-force can be predicated of the region (WP Sio66-67). In this respect Nietzsche's views are similar to those of Boscovich, especially if we inter- pret N-force as Boscovich's inertial force and repulsive and attractive forces. However, there is an important feature of Nietzsche's theory not found in Boscovich's. Nietzsche speaks of the power which can be exercised in each region. Power and force are distinct concepts in mechanics and they should be treated as distinct in Nietzsche's theory. However, Nietzsche's concept of power is totally unlike any of the various concepts of power found in physics. He makes this point in the following remark when he says of the concept of force employed in physics that it " . . . still needs to be com- pleted: an inner will must be ascribed to it which I designate as 'will to power', i.e., as an insatiable desire to manifest power; or as the employ- ment and exercise of power, as a creative drive, etc." (WP ?6i9). This remark suggests that we could interpret N-force as force of the kind found in physics. However, as far as theories of physics are concerned it has 8 Nietzsche offers some bad arguments for this claim. However-the position is a possible one to adopt with respect to time and space - in fact it was adopted by Aristotle. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 529</page><page sequence="6">always been an otiose piece of anthropomorphism to add to our under- standing of force an "inner will to power"; it plays no role either in physi- cal theory or in any of its applications. But the remark does indicate that in Nietzsche's world-conception there is a further item of power to consider. This we can treat as an undefined primitive, as we have "N-force," and refer to it as "Nietzsche power" or "N-power" for short. Each of the regions of space-time, or centres, will have both powers and forces predi- cated of them. The N-forces and N-powers occurring at the centres will be collectively called "N-force-powers." N-force-power is the fundamental and only category in Nietzsche's ontology. N-force-powers are quite disembodied and are not like substances. They are more like pure disposi- tions or propensities which occur at some region of space-time. Power and will to power are central notions in Nietzsche's world-con- ception that are not easy to explicate. The word "power" had its original use in Nietzsche's writings in the context of power relations between peo- ple and in his view about psychological drives.9 In addition we do ordi- narily speak of bodies having powers in the sense of dispositions or abili- ties to behave in certain ways under certain conditions. Nietzsche's employment of power as a metaphysical notion is akin to this but with two significant differences; the powers are disembodied and they may be anthropomorphically characterized as ceaselessly seeking situations in which the power can be exercised (hence the will to power). Nietzsche expresses his metaphysical idea of power as follows: My idea is that every specific body strives to become master over all space and to extend its force (-its will to power:) and to thrust back all that resists its extension. But it continually encounters similar efforts on the part of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement ("union") with those of them that are sufficiently related to it: thus they then conspire together for power. And the process goes on. (WP ?636) In this passage Nietzsche does use the term 'body' but, as will be seen, this must be understood in a non-material or non-substance like manner; the term is simply a shorthand for a temporary union of powers and forces. But the passage does convey the idea of power as a ceaselessly active drive and not a disposition which may be active in only certain conditions. Viewing power centres anthropomorphically, each centre has the power always to deploy actively whatever forces are at its command (in the style, say, of a general and his military forces) in such a way as to maximize the effectiveness of the forces deployed and to resist whatever forces are in opposition.' ' For a discussion of the origin of Nietzsche's concept of will to power see W. Kaufmann, Nietzsche (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, Third Edition, i968), chapter 6. 0 These remarks are necessarily brief. The power/force distinction is more fully discussed 530 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="7">(4) There is a constant ebb and flow in the quantity of force at each of the centres (WP S i067). Just how much ebb and flow is there? Some, including Nietzsche himself, have suggested that the ebb and flow is cha- otic: "the world is not an organism at all, but chaos" (WP ?71 I); "The total character of the world, however, is in all eternity chaos - in the sense not of a lack of necessity, but of a lack of order, arrangement, form, beauty, wisdom and whatever other names there are for our aesthetic anthropomorphisms" (GS ? i09). This suggests that the chaos is only with respect to our aesthetic anthropomorphisms and not because there is a "lack of necessity." It is not the case that anything goes in Nietzsche's world; there are definite relations between the centres of N-force-power and the way they vary with one another. Thus he says: "Every centre of force adopts a perspective toward the entire remainder, i.e., its own par- ticular valuation, mode of action, and mode of resistance" (WP 5 67 and also ? 5 68 which is along similar lines). This rather Leibnizian remark suggests that there are relations that every N-force-power centre has to every other such centre, but the relations are described anthropomorphi- cally as "perspectives" or "modes of valuation, action and resistance." One sentence after this quotation Nietzsche adds: "Now there is no other mode of action whatever; and the 'world' is only a word for the totality of these actions. Reality consists precisely in this particular action and reac- tion of every individual part towards the whole." This remark serves to underline Nietzsche's view that there is an independent world (of which we are part) and that this world comprises relations between centres of N-force-power. In other passages Nietzsche characterizes N-force-power and its rela- tions less anthropomorphically: Supposing that the world had a certain quantum of force at its disposal, then it is obvious that every displacement of power at any point would affect the whole system-thus together with sequential causality there would be a contiguous and concurrent dependence. (WP ?638) Again, referring to N-force-powers as dynamic quanta, Nietzsche claims: . [there are] only dynamic quanta, in a relation of tension to all other dynamic quanta: their essence lies in their relation to all other quanta, in toir "effect" upon the same. The will to power [is] not a being, not a becoming, but a pathos-the most elemental fact from which a becoming and effecting first emerge - (WP ?635) in R. Schacht, Nietzsche (London: Routledge and ?egan Paul, 1983), especially chapter 4, pp. I87-z34. I am indebted to his account. Schacht's book generally raises the study of Nietzsche to a new level. The critical comments in Part II directed at sections of his book are not meant to detract from its overall value. NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 53 1</page><page sequence="8">This serves to underline the point that Nietzsche's ontology has only N-force powers and that these are quite fundamental and elemental because from them arises all creation, destruction, continuing activity and change. But in addition there is the quite strong claim that even N-force- powers have an "essence" which is their "relation of tension" between one another. Apart from saying that there are relations of "sequential causality," or of "contiguous and concurrent dependence" or "essential relations of tension," Nietzsche does not tell us anything more about them. But it is possible to arrive at formulas which express these relations: . for that something is as it is, as strong or as weak, is not the consequence of an obedi- ence or a rule or a compulsion. The degree of resistance and the degree of superior power-this is the question in every event: if, for our day-to-day calculations, we know how to express this in formulas and "laws," so much the better for us! . . . A quantum of power is designated by the effect it produces and that which it resists. (WP ?634) These remarks occur in a passage in which Nietzsche argues that we should abandon the concepts of necessity and law. Even if these concepts can be abandoned it is clear that we are left with ways of calculating degrees of power in terms of the power's ability to produce effects and resist being affected. So much for the view that Nietzsche's ontology is one of chaos. Whatever criticisms there may be of an ontology of disembodied powers and forces acting in regions of space-time, it is clear that N-force- powers enter into definite and formulatable relations with one another. Finally there are two other theses concerning Nietzsche's world-con- ception to be mentioned. (5) The world is uncreated and has and will exist at all times (WP Si o66). That is, the N-force-powers were never created and always exist. (6) N-force-powers are all there is in Nietzsche's ontol- ogy (perhaps including space and time as irreducible items as well). This is a point already encountered above and is encapsulated in the remark: "This world is the will to power-and nothing besides" (WP ? i067). This list of theses is not a complete account of Nietzsche's world-conception but it will suffice for our purposes. The theory outlined in theses (i) to (6) is suggestive but crude and underdeveloped in many of its possible applications. This is to be expected as Nietzsche jotted down the remarks in notebooks over a period of six years (i883-88) and never finalized their organization or rethought them as he would have if he were to have published them. But a number of the ideas of this theory and a number of its applications occur in published writings just before, during and after the period of the note- books. One of these is the theme of eternal recurrence which occurs in a number of published works. In The Will to Power the doctrine of eternal recurrence gets a special formulation in the language of the six theses 5 3 2 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="9">above and an attempt is made to prove it from these theses. The doctrine, which Nietzsche calls "the most scientific of all possible hypotheses" (WP 5 5), can be expressed thus: every possible combination of N-force-pow- ers at the finite number of centres in space will occur in a finite amount of time and thus will recur an infinite number of times in infinite time. Most commentators agree that the proof is a failure." The doctrine can be set aside as an inessential part of Nietzsche's theory of the world or it could be listed as a seventh independent claim further constraining the relations in which N-force-powers operate. II. The Correspondence Theory of Truth and Nietzsche's World-Conception Nietzsche hoped that his theory of N-force powers (i.e., his theory based on the will to power) would provide the framework for a metaphysical program which would yield explanations and analyses in empirical sci- ences such as mechanics, psychology, biology, as well as theories concern- ing morality and society. The chapter headings of The Will to Power provided by its original editors (which they based on one of several sets of suggestions by Nietzsche) attest to this in that the will to power is dis- cussed in connection with nature (both physical and biological), the indi- vidual and society. In Beyond Good and Evil Nietzsche outlines the full scope of his metaphysical program with respect to some sciences (BGE S36):]2 In short, one has to risk the hypothesis whether will does not affect will where ever "effects" are recognized - and whether all mechanical occurrences are not, insofar as a force is active in them, will force, effects of will. Suppose, finally, we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one basic form of the will - namely, of the will to power, as my proposition has it; suppose all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power and one could also find in it the solution of the problem of procrea- tion and nourishment - it is one problem - then one would have gained the right to deter- mine all efficient force univocally as - will to power. The world viewed from inside, the For example, consult the papers by Danto, Soll and Zuboff in R. Solomon, ed., Nietzsche (New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1973). In quoting nearly all of his own translation of ?36 of BGE on pp. 75-76 of his Discovering the Mind, Volume II: Nietzsche, Heidegger and Buber (New York: McGraw-Hill, i980) Walter Kaufmann omits the significant clause after the dash in the first sentence quoted here. As his remarks on pp. 76-77 indicate, he thinks that the will to power is pri- marily a thesis of psychology and only marginally one in biology, physics, and metaphys- ics. The view taken here is that Nietzsche risked the hypothesis that the will to power was of primary importance in all four areas. Risky hypotheses take the risk of being false, as I think the will to power hypothesis is in biology and physics; however one cannot show on empirical grounds that a metaphysical hypothesis is false. NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 533</page><page sequence="10">world defined and determined according to its "intelligible character" -it would be "will to power" and nothing else. How successful has Nietzsche's metaphysical program been in estab- lishing a basis in the empirical sciences? This is a matter to be investigated by examining the progress of knowledge in each science. Without fully justifying the claim my view is that Nietzsche's metaphysical program is either a non-starter or a failure. With respect to modern physics one might at a superficial level accord Nietzsche a certain prescience in abandoning atoms as the building-blocks of nature and, perhaps, in Einstein's mass- energy equivalence theorem suppose a possible instance of a non-material ontology which is akin to the N-force-power ontology. But this is superficial analogy only. Modern physical theory is quite unlike Nietzsche's. In addition, Nietzsche's program has contributed nothing to the development of these theories and is therefore a quite "degenerate" program (to employ a term of Lakatos' for appraising rival research pro- grams)'3 in that it has not provided the impetus whereby new results have been discovered in these fields. As for theories of mechanics the "will" has played no role whatever. In biology theories of genetics based on the structure of the DNA molecule leave no room for any notion of the will to power, especially in the theory of procreation. Even Dawkins' "selfish gene" theory is not an instance of the will to power. Dawkins uses the anthropomorphic term 'selfish' to characterize the activity of genes but always insists that this is a metaphor which can be translated back into the language of gene theory, viz., the language of chemistry.'4 Thus when compared with theory in the natural and life sciences Nietzsche's program fails.'5 The failure may be judged in at least two ways. The first, already 3 See chapter i of I. Lakatos, The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes: Philosophical Papers Vol. I (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978). '4 See R. Dawkins, The Selfish Gene (London: Paladin, 1976), especially p. 48 and p. 95. However in his recent book The Extended Phenotype (Oxford: Oxford University Press, I983) Dawkins makes some remarks about genes which have a distinctly Nietz- schean flavour, especially when he talks of genes exerting power: "We are going to use the metaphor of power. An active replicator is a chunk of genome [the entire collection of genes possessed by an organism] that, when compared to its alleles, exerts phenotypic power over its world, such that its frequency increases or decreases relative to that of its alleles" (p. 9I). Elsewhere Dawkins speaks of his having built up an ". . . image of a tur- moil of selfish replicators, battling for their own survival at the expense of their alleles . . ." (p. o50). However note that Dawkins talks of the "metaphor of power." Presumably he would want to cash out the talk of power in terms of the chemical proper- ties of genes and the causal relations into which these chemical properties enter. IS This ignores other applications of the will to power in other sciences. See, for example, Kaufmann's claim' (see footnote i z) that the will to power is primarily a psychological hypothesis, especially one in Freudian psychology. Whether Freud's psychological theo- 534 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="11">mentioned, is that it is a degenerate program in that it has not produced any of the growth in knowledge that its rival theories have produced, e.g., Darwin's theory is a rival which is still a progressive program in biology. Second, it could be rejected on grounds deriving from the coherence theory of truth; Nietzsche's program fails to cohere with other well-estab- lished theories in the natural and biological sciences. The coherence cri- terion is endorsed by Nietzsche himself: "An isolated judgment is never 'true', never knowledge; only in the connection and relation of many judgments is there any surety" (WP ?530). Whatever the degree of success or failure of Nietzsche's theory as a whole, Nietzsche did view it as a rival to some of the main theories of sci- ence of his day, in particular Darwin's theory of evolution and mechanis- tic atomism. The latter theory, unlike Nietzsche's, is committed to an ontology of small indivisible- everlasting bits of matter that retain their identity and unity throughout time. In deciding between these two rivals we might investigate them in the light of the two criteria mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph. A third criterion might be to discover which best corresponds to how the world is. This suggests that some ver- sion of the correspondence theory of truth is presupposed in the methods of test to be employed. But some have rejected the correspondence theory of truth as begging the question against Nietzsche's theory of the world; so the correspondence theory should not be employed in any attempt to evaluate Nietzsche's theory but some other theory of truth instead. The argument goes like this: (i) Nietzsche's theory is not committed to any enduring or stable items like substance, matter or atoms; (ii) the atomic theory of matter, and substance theories, are committed to such items; (iii) the correspondence theory of truth requires that there be some permanent items in order that there be a correspondence between what is said of the world and what is in the world; therefore, in adjudicating between Nietzsche's theory and the atomic theory of matter, either we abandon Nietzsche's theory (as the correspondence theory of truth can- not be applied to it) or we seek some other non-correspondence theory to adjudicate between them. There is also the option of the relativist: each sufficiently broad theory of the world carries with it its own theory of truth and there is no overarching theory of truth suitable for adjudicating between rival theories. ries are themselves scientific is a difficult matter to determine and Nietzsche's will to power hypothesis can only make that determination even more difficult. Also ignored are the applications recent French writers such as Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Guattari have made of Nietzsche's views in their own accounts of society, politics, language and psychology. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 5 3 5</page><page sequence="12">The argument is unsound because premise (iii) is false. However, (iii) is held true by many commentators on Nietzsche and they allege that Nietzsche held (iii) as well, and so rejected the correspondence theory of truth rather than his own theory of the world. Certainly if the correspon- dence theory of truth presupposes that there be permanent items like substance, matter, or atoms, then the theory is inconsistent with Nietzsche's ontology. But not all versions of the correspondence theory of truth need have such a presupposition built into them. It will be argued that Nietzsche is committed to a correspondence theory of truth but not one with such ontological presuppositions. The point behind (iii) is well expressed by R. Schacht who claims that (iii) really involves a commit- ment to a picture version of the correspondence theory of truth. In dis- cussing what Nietzsche calls "man's truths" (amongst which are included our ordinary beliefs about the- world concerning the existence of com- monplace objects) Schacht says: Nietzsche further holds the correspondence theory of truth (as traditionally understood) to be wanting in that, on his view, it cannot be the case that the "truth" of any such proposi- tions [i.e., man's truths] - and indeed of any propositions at all - is a matter of their stand- ing in a correspondence-relation to a reality that has an intrinsic structural articulation and ordering, since there is no such reality for propositions to correspond to. The world, as he conceives it, has the character of "becoming" rather than of "being," of "flux" rather than structure, and at bottom of "chaos" in the sense of the absence of an inherent, immutable order of any sort.. . . And if this is so, no version of the correspondence theory presuppos- ing the existence of what he calls a "'true world' of being" can stand. . . .If truth is conceived as a correspondence of thought and being, therefore, or of a structurally articulated proposition to a comparably ordered state of affairs the features of which are fixed independently of the process through which it becomes an object of experi- ence, there is and can be nothing of the kind. When Nietzsche asserts that "there is no truth," his point is that no propositions are or can be true in this sense.'6 These remarks apply not just to the class of propositions called "man's truths" (the status of these will be discussed in parts III and IV). They explicitly apply to all propositions amongst which must be included those of Nietzsche's metaphysical world-conception as outlined in part I. (We shall see shortly that Schacht modifies this claim.) Two points arise from this quotation. The first concerns the version of the correspondence theory of truth to which Nietzsche's world-conception is committed. Schacht maintains that the only admissible version of the correspondence theory is a picture version. I6 R. Schacht, op. cit., pp. 6i-6z. 536 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="13">This I wish to dispute. One classic account of the picture theory of truth (which is close to Schacht's account of the correspondence relation) can be found in Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. On this theory atomic propositions are true in virtue of their picturing an atomic state of affairs. The names in atomic propositions refer to semantically simple items, viz., objects. These objects in turn are held to be metaphysi- cal simples. Of these objects Wittgenstein says: "Objects are simple" (z.oz); "Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot be composite" (z.ozi); "Substance is what subsists independently of what is the case" (2.024); "Objects, the unalterable, and the subsistent are one and the same" (2.027); "Objects are what is unalterable and sub- sistent, their configuration is what is changing and unstable" (2.0271). These remarks'7 add up to the claim that Wittgensteinian objects com- prise the substance of the world and they are unalterable simples; only their connection with one another is alterable. In order for an atomic proposition to be true it must picture the configuration of such objects in a state of affairs. Clearly on such a picture version of the correspondence theory of truth an ontology is built into the theory which is inconsistent with Nietzsche's ontology., However, not all picture versions of the correspondence theory of truth are committed to such an ontology. Consider the theory of truth outlined by Russell in his eight lectures entitled "The Philosophy of Logical Atom- ism."8 Atomic propositions if true also picture atomic facts. The proper names in atomic propositions are defined as "words for particulars" (p. 2oo) and particulars are defined as the "terms of [i.e., the items which stand in] relations in atomic facts" (p. i99). Russell then tells us that these particulars are ". . . such things as little patches of colour or sounds, momentary things . . ." (p. I79). In addition each particular ". stands entirely alone and is completely self-subsistent. It has that sort of self-subsistence that used to belong to substance, except that it usually only persists through a very short time. . ." (p. zoi-2); "A particular, as a rule, is apt to last for a very short time indeed, not an instant but a very short time. In that respect particulars differ from the old substances, but in their logical position they do not" (p. 203-4). Russellian particulars clearly differ from Wittgensteinian objects in that they are not like subs- tances and do change. Russell's theory of truth is a correspondence theory and, in a certain sense, a picture version of that theory, but its ontological 7 The quotations are from L. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, I96I). i8 See Bertrand Russell, Logic and Knowledge, edited by R. Marsh (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1956). The following page references to "The Philosophy of Logical Atom- ism" are to this volume. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 537</page><page sequence="14">presuppositions are unlike those of Wittgenstein's theory. Russell's ontol- ogy is also different from Nietzsche's though both share a common fea- ture not held by Witgenstein's - they admit items which undergo change. The second point to emerge from the passage quoted from Schacht is more in the nature of a suggestion. In the second sentence Nietzsche's view of the world is alleged to be one of flux, change and mutability. Now some have held (though this is not explicitly stated by Schacht) that since truth is immutable there can be no correspondence at all between immu- table truth and a highly mutable world. A classic refutation of this view is given by G. E. Moore"9 in his criticism of some pragmatists who seem to have held that there could be no correspondence theory of truth for the reason just given. Moore makes the obvious point that the truth of many statements depends on the time of utterance of the statement, and that temporally tagged statements can be true of a mutable world, or a mutable aspect of our not so obviously mutable world. Thus the state- ment "there is a gust of wind now" is true if and only if at the time and place at which the sentence is uttered a gust of wind occurs (otherwise it is false). In the light of these points it is clear that we need, for Nietzsche's theory of the world, a realist theory of truth which is free of the ontological restrictions imposed by a narrow picture version of the correspondence theory of truth (such as Wittgenstein's picture theory) and which can accommodate temporally relative statements from Nietzsche's theory which are about a world of fluxions of N-force-power from one spatial region to another. Such a version of a more broadly construed correspon- dence theory of truth is provided by Tarski's theory of truth and its method of specifying the truth-conditions for sentences of a theory."0 '9 See G. E. Moore, section z of "Williams James' 'Pragmatism"' in Philosophical Studies (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1922). Whether or not Tarski's theory of truth is a version of the correspondence theory of truth is open to debate. D. Davidson regards it as such in his "True to the Facts," The Journal of Philosophy 66 (I969): 748-64. For more on this point see S. Haack, Philosophy of Logics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), pp. 99-Ii6, especially pp. i io-i6. There is a quite natural and thoroughly realist understanding of Tarski's definition of truth which derives from the explication of truth he offers in terms of the satisfaction of sentences (open or closed) by sequences of objects. The relation of satis- faction holding between sentences and sequences has some affinity with the kinds of rela- tions correspondence theorists have sought in that it is a relation between linguistic items and items in the world in terms of which the truth of sentences can be defined. Given this, it is not too far amiss to view Tarski's theory of truth as a quite broadly construed version of the correspondence theory of truth. In fact Tarski starts his search for a semantical definition of truth from a classic statement of a version of the correspondence theory of truth (see the beginning of S i of "The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages" in A. 538 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="15">Consider, for example, a useful analogy from physics. We are told that at all points in space there is a gravitational field present, no matter how weak. Imagine a region of space where the gravitational field acts and sup- pose that the field continuously fluctuates in its strength over time. Con- sider the strength of the field at a point P of space and a moment of time t. Then formulate a sentence S of the physical theory of the following sort (assuming some unit system of force): 'F is a gravitational force acting in direction D at point P in space at time t'. In accordance with Tarski's Con- vention T this sentence will be true if and only if F is a gravitational force acting in direction D at point P at time t (otherwise the sentence is false). Such a T-sentence is derived from the assignment of designations to the expressions of the language of the physical theory. In particular, we can analyse the sentence S as being formed from the two-place open sentence ". . .is a gravitational force acting at. . ." by filling the first place with a term which designates a force vector F (where the magnitude of the force is F and the direction D in which the force acts is specified by the direction of the vector) and by filling the second place with a term which designates a 4-dimensional space-time co-ordinate &lt;xI, yN, zI, t1&gt; (where x1, yTO Z1 are, respectively, points on the three suitably chosen axes of 3-dimensional space and t1 is a point on a suitably chosen time axis). Thus the sentence S will be true if and only if the designations of the terms in S stand in the right relation, that is, if and only if F is a gravitational force acting at &lt;X., Y1, Z1, t,&gt;. Technically, the specification of designations for terms is with respect to sequence of objects from the domain of quantification (which includes force vectors and points in space-time) and the truth-conditions for sentences are specified in terms of their satisfac- tion by any such sequence. However this complication can be ignored where we are dealing with a closed sentence such as sentence S above. What is most significant for our purposes is that the truth-conditions for sentences like S are given in terms of "objects" which are in fact force-vec- tors and space-time points. In a similar vein we can set down the truth-conditions for sentences of Boscovich's theory of mechanics. The specification of truth-conditions for the sentence "Force F acts in direction D at point P of space at time t" of Boscovich's mechanics will differ from the example just given only in that the two-place open sentence from which it is constructed does not specify that the force F should always be a gravitational force. In both cases the truth-conditions of sentences are given in terms of "objects" which are in fact force-vectors and points in 4-dimensional space-time. The truth-con- Tarski, Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1956]). It is in this realist, and broadly correspondence, sense that Tarski's theory will be under- stood in this paper. NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 539</page><page sequence="16">ditions for sentences of such physical theories can be given by a Tarskian theory of truth; it presupposes no ontology inconsistent with that pro- posed by the physical theories no matter how non-standard their ontology may be. Now consider Nietzsche's theory with its N-force-powers acting at regions of space at a given time. We can formulate a sentence of Nietzsche's theory (assuming a system of units for quantities of N-force- power) and specify its truth-conditions as follows: the sentence "An N-force-power of magnitude m occurs at region R of space at time t" is true if and only if an N-force-power of magnitude m occurs at region R of space at time t (otherwise the sentence is false). In a similar manner we can analyse this sentence as being formed from the two-place open sentence ". . . occurs at . ." by filling the first place with a term which desig- nates an N-force-power of magnitude m, and by filling the second place with a term which designates a 3-dimensional volume of space R and a time t. Thus the sentence will be true if and only if the designations of these terms stand in the right relation, that is, if and only if an N-force-power of magnitude m occurs in the region of space R at time t. Thus the truth-con- ditions for the sentence of Nietzsche's theory are given in terms of "objects" which are in fact N-force-powers of a given magnitude and slices of space-time. The specification of these truth-conditions can be given within a theory of truth which proposes no ontology inconsistent with that proposed by Nietzsche's theory no matter how non-standard an ontology of N-force-powers may appear. This is the advantage of a Tar- skian approach to the specification of the truth-conditions of sentences of Nietzsche's theory over the narrower picture version of the correspon- dence theory of truth. Such a theory of truth allows adjudication between Nietzsche's theory of the world and other rival substance-based or mate- rial-based theories since it is neutral with respect to these rivals. That Nietzsche is committed to a realist correspondence theory of truth for the sentences of his theory of the world is evident from many of his remarks cited in part I of this paper. Nietzsche's view that the thesis of eternal recurrence is a true claim which is validly derivable from his theory of the world (see WP SIO57 and Sio66) also commits him to the belief that the propositions expressing his theory (see theses (i) to (6) in part I) are true. Whether or not theses (i) to (6) are true is an epistemological matter to be determined by our methods of test. But that they have truth- conditions is necessary if they are to play any role in the derivation of a conclusion alleged to be true. If it is thought that the remarks cited in part I rely too heavily on the posthumously published notes of The Will to Power then one can find similar comments in his published writings. Thus 540 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="17">in Beyond Good and Evil Nietzsche proclaims that "the world . . . [is] 'will to power' and nothing else" (BGE 5 3 6, quoted above). Later he adds that there is a new species of philosopher (of which he is one of the first) who are "new friends of 'truth"' (BGE 543), it being evident in the next section that the truth involves at least understanding the world in terms of the will to power. As an example of such an understanding Nietzsche con- siders the exploitation of one person by another; this he says is simply "a consequence of the will to power" and adds: "If this should be an innova- tion as a theory - as a reality it is the primordial fact of all history" (BGE 5259). Few commentators on Nietzsche have accepted that he is committed to a correspondence theory of truth; most have strenuously denied it usually because they have adopted a quite narrow picture version of the corre- spondence theory." Schacht recognizes, in his recent book, the complex- ities in Nietzsche's position. However, the only reference Schacht makes to something like a Tarskian analysis of truth occurs in his comments on what, following Nietzsche, he calls "man's truths""; he says that Nietzsche ". . . does not preclude the possibility of his giving any general formal characterization of what it is for at least most such propositions [i.e., commonsense 'man's truths'] to be 'true', which goes beyond the trivial analysis to the effect that "'p' is true if and only if p". "'s But in fact no formal analysis of this class of propositions employing the Tarskian disquotational schema is intended. Rather Schacht talks of a kind of "D-relative truth"'4 in which truth for this class of propositions is rela- tive to a domain of discourse. But the domain of discourse is not to be understood as it is in formal semantics in which variables of some quantification theory range over items in a domain (a device of logic which is central to the full use of Tarski's theory of truth). Rather it is to be " For example, see Danto's rejection of the correspondence theory of truth on p. 3 3 and p. 75 of A. Danto, Nietzsche as Philosopher (New York: Macmillan, i965). Danto's view is usefully criticized by Schacht in section ? of his paper "Nietzsche and Nihilism" in R. Solomon, ed., Nietzsche (New York: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1973). R. Grimm in chapters ? and 3 of his Nietzsche's Theory of Knowledge (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1977) rejects entirely the view that Nietzsche is committed to any version of the corre- spondence theory of truth. " See R. Schacht, Nietzsche, op. cit., pp. 58-59. Nietzsche says: "What are man's truths ultimately? Merely his irrefutable errors" (GS ?z65). The class of propositions called "man's truths" includes our ordinary everyday claims about the world, especially claims about the existence of ordinary objects, as well as scientific claims which are extensions of these commonsense claims. A striking feature of Nietzsche's philosophy, to be dis- cussed in the next two parts, is that all of the propositions in this class are false. 23 Op. cit., p. 64. 4 Op. cit., pp. 6i-64. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 54I</page><page sequence="18">understood in a much more loosely Wittgensteinian sense in which the sentences of some discourse have a role within the context of a language- game and a particular form of life. The notion of D-relative truth enables Schacht to give an account of Nietzsche's doctrine of perspectivism. He says of the class of "man's truths": "Such propositions represent certain states of affairs as obtaining which do so only for us, and cannot be supposed to obtain independently of the 'perspective' within which we happen to be operating. " ' Not only are certain propositions D-relatively true (or false) but states of affairs obtain (or do not obtain) relative to us and our perspective. This seems to invite all the difficulties that surround the notion of relative truth that were first raised by Plato in the Theaetatus against Protagoras' relativism and that have been echoed by most philosophers since.'6 (In part III a non-relativist pragmatic theory of truth and belief for the class of "man's truths" is advocated.) Given this setting for the class of "man's truths" it is clear that the reference to the disquotation schema is not to be understood in a Tarskian manner. However Schacht does not wish to maintain that all propositions are either D-relatively true or D-relatively false. He acknowledges that . . . in pronouncing "man's truths" generally to be "erroneous," Nietzsche is implicitly operating with something like a correspondence conception of "truth" and "error" after all and one in which the notion of correspondence invoked is not simply a matter of the appropriateness of a D-relative proposition to an experienced or contemplated state of affairs, the relevant features of which are fixed by the discourse within which both occur."7 Thus appeal to a non-relativist correspondence theory of truth is, in the long run, necessary if any sense is to be given to Nietzsche's claim that "man's truths" are erroneous. Schacht distinguishes three orders of analysis of truth in Nietzsche, the first-order analysis of truth being confined largely to "man's truths." Rel- evant to our current concerns is the third-order analysis of truth he offers for the class of propositions of Nietzsche's metaphysical world-concep- tion. Although he does not always make it clear, Schacht does not advo- 25 Op. cit., p. 63. 26 That Nietzsche rejects a relativist view of truth for his metaphysical world-conception is clear from ? zz of Beyond Good and Evil. Nietzsche invites us to contrast a theory of the world which invokes the idea of nature's conformity to law and his own theory which does not. Two rival interpretations can now be ". . . read out of the same 'nature' and with regard to the same phenomena. . . ." Even though Nietzsche speaks of rival inter- pretations, talk of "the same nature" and of "the same phenomena" precludes a thor- ough-going relativization to distinct worlds. It is only with respect to one and the same world that the interpretations can sensibly be said to be rivals. 27 Op. cit., p. 64. 54X ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="19">cate that these propositions are of another kind of domain-relative mode of discourse for which it makes no sense to ask whether they are non-rela- tively true or false of the world. Sometimes he speaks of a ". . . third-or- der analysis in terms of a relative adequacy-relation between characteri- zations and states of affairs . . ."; or he says that ". . . the requirement of some sort of relation of relative adequacy of something asserted of the world (our existence included) with respect to what happens to obtain and transpire in it is here regarded as essential.""8 However the relative adequacy is with respect to the concepts we have constructed for the pur- pose of depicting the world as it really is. Our current concepts and theo- ries may turn out to be inadequate to this task in various ways. In this respect there is a significant analogy with accounts of the growth of sci- ence proposed by philosophers of science such as Kuhn and Feyerabend; the concepts and theories of the various sciences current at a time may help us cope well or badly with the world and be open to revision or total replacement. However in contrast to Kuhn and Feyerabend there is a Popperian element of verisimilitude; just as Popper alleges that there is a measure of how far the sequence of false theories we have so far con- structed can be compared with one another for their respective truth and falsity contents, so in talking of relative adequacy Schacht alleges that there is some measure of "aptness of a characterization in relation to that which it characterizes.""9 Granting this, there is still a reluctance on Schacht's part to openly embrace a realist correspondence theory of truth for Nietzsche's world- conception. Instead he speaks somewhat evasively of "degrees of homol- ogy" as when he says of the concepts and theories that we invent that their character stands in at least some degree of homology to that of events of which we can and do have experience, and which language pro- vides us means of designating and specifying.""3 And shortly after this he claims to have ". . . render[ed] coherent the notion of truth under con- sideration, construed in terms of the aptness of assertions with respect to how matters stand with reality, not merely as it is commonly apprehended in the course of our ordinary experience, but rather as it is more funda- mentally constituted."3' What is this but another way of talking of the correspondence theory of truth (and its close ally versimilitude)? The approach in this paper is not so coy. As has been illustrated above, the cor- 28 Op. cit., p. II. 29 Op. cit., p. 99. Schacht intends aptness to be a more broad concept than verisimilitude. But there is an instructive analogy between Nietzsche's views on the aptness of our con- cepts and beliefs and some recent analyses of the growth of science. 30 Op. cit., p. 114. 31 Op. cit., p. 115. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 543</page><page sequence="20">respondence theory of truth understood in a Tarskian manner is the theory that does justice to Nietzsche's metaphysical world-conception. Whether that world-conception turns out to be true, or false, is, of course, another matter. III. Illusion and the Pragmatic Theory of Truth and Belief If, in Boscovich's theory of mechanics, there are only forces acting at points, then what account can be given of matter or material, the alleged stuff of ordinary objects? Boscovich says that matter is "made up of per- fectly indivisible points separated from one another by a definite interval" or that matter is a "composition from points" (Article i64).3' What the "made up" or the "composition" relation is like is unclear. But it is clear that Boscovich has a strongly reductive account of matter and may have wanted to identify matter with a structured arrangement of points at which forces act, i.e, the expressions "piece of matter occupying the 3-dimensional region of space R" and "the set of points within the 3-dimensional region of space R at which forces are acting" are co-refer- ring expressions. If, in Nietzsche's theory of the world, there are only centres at which occur quantities of N-force-power then what account can be given of mat- ter, substance and ordinary objects such as tables, chairs, planets and per- sons? Nietzsche's comments on this are few. In some passages he seems to hold as strong a reductive account of these items as does Boscovich of matter. Apparently these items are to be identified with complexes of N-force-powers: "Duration, identity with itself, being are inherent nei- ther in that which is called subject nor in that which is called object: they are complexes of events apparently durable in comparison with other complexes - e.g., through the difference in tempo of the event" (WP ?5 5 z). Nietzsche uses the term 'event' to refer to the occurrence of a com- plex of N-force-powers in a region of space-time and it is these with which objects and subjects (i.e., persons) are to be identified. Nietzsche is not specific about how each complex of N-force-powers is arranged but some hint of how the powers are disposed to act has already been given in part I. Talk of the "tempo of an event" is not particularly helpful in accounting for the durability of an object. Presumably objects are durable if the complexes of N-force-power with which they are identified are sta- ble over time. This suggests that the identity conditions for objects are the same as for complexes. However the identity conditions for complexes made of substantive parts (e.g., atoms, molecules or cells) are not always straightforward, and this would be equally so for complexes whose parts 32 R. Boscovich, A Theory of Natural Philosophy (Cambridge: The M.I.T. Press, i966). 544 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="21">are not substantive but are like N-force-powers. Nietzsche recognizes this when he speaks of "organizational unities" of N-force-powers the parts of which have achieved some degree of mutual accommodation with one another: "All unity is unity only as organization and co-operation - just as a human community is a unity - as opposed to an atomistic anarchy, as a pattern of domination that signifies a unity but is not a unity" (WP ? 56i). The phrase "signifies a unity but is not a unity" is obscure. But we can take it that the substantive unity philosophers have often attributed to objects is rejected by Nietzsche. He claims: "There are no durable ulti- mate units, no atoms, no monads" (WP ?715). This much is consistent with Nietzsche's basic ontology of N-force-powers. But we should not take this to entail that there are no lesser grades of unity which apply to complexes of N-force-power. The few passages in which Nietzsche talks of complexes, or of organi- zational unities, of N-force-power become significant when we consider that Nietzsche denies that there is any self-identity and, further, denies that there are things or objects. In fact his catalogue of non-existents include most of the traditional items beloved by philosophers. There is no God; there are no souls, mind or Cartesian thinking substances; there is no matter; there are no atoms, monads, substances, or Kantian things-in- themselves; there are no abstract items such as concepts, forms, species, kinds or mathematical entities. Some of these claims are strikingly expressed in The Gay Science SI iO: Origin of knowledge. - Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. A few of these proved to be useful and helped to preserve the species: those who hit upon or inherited these had better luck in their struggle for themselves and their progeny. Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited, until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following: that there are enduring things; that there are equal things; that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself. It was only very late that such propositions were denied and doubted; it was only very late that truth emerged - as the weakest form of knowledge. It seemed that one was unable to live with it. our organism was prepared for the opposite; all its higher functions, sense perception and every kind of sensation worked with those basic errors which had been incorporated since time immemorial. Indeed, even in the realm of knowledge these proposi- tions became the norms according to which "true" and "untrue" were determined - down to the most remote regions of logic.33 3 Similar claims about what does not exist can be found scattered throughout works that Nietzsche published or left unpublished. Thus in Twilight of the Idols (S 5 of the section entitled "'Reason' in Philosophy") we find: "Today . . . precisely insofar as the preju- dice of reason forces us to posit unity, identity, permanence, substance, cause, thinghood, being, we see ourselves somehow caught in error, compelled into error." (p. 48Z, W. Kaufmann, The Portable Nietzsche (New York: Viking Press, 19541). For an extreme NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 545</page><page sequence="22">The quotation contains two significant points for the interpretation of Nietzsche's views. (i) The sense in which our beliefs about what exists are erroneous is to be understood in terms of the correspondence theory of truth. That it is true that there are no such items has only recently been realized, says Nietzsche, adding that this truth has emerged "as the weak- est form of knowledge." This comment perhaps indicates that the overall degree of strength, and longevity, of belief in the existence of such objects is overwhelmingly greater than the overall degree of strength, and longev- ity, of belief in their non-existence, and that the belief in their existence has played a significant role in the survival of our species while the belief in their non-existence has played no role - indeed if it had it would have been positively detrimental to our survival. (ii) The passage reveals Nietzsche's commitment to a version of the theory of evolution. Not only are our bodies, and in particular our sense-organs, the product of evolu- tion, but also our "intellect" by which Nietzsche means the language we use, the concepts we form and the beliefs we hold. Nietzsche says of con- sciousness: "Consciousness is present only to the extent that conscious- ness is useful" (WP 5505). And later he adds: "All our organs of knowl- edge and our senses are developed only with regard to conditions of preservation and growth" (WP 5507). Thus Nietzsche's views about our intellect are entirely naturalistic, i.e., the intellect is part of and continuous with the natural order as described in his world-conception outlined in part I. The naturalistic orientation is well expressed in the following remark: "To what extent even our intellect is a consequence of conditions of existence-: we would not have it if we did not need to have it, and we would not have it as it is if we did not need to have it as it is, if we could live otherwise." (WP 5498). Nietzsche insists that the life-preserving beliefs we hold as a result of evolutionary processes are false rather than true. Not all the beliefs we form are life-preserving. For example, the belief that Nietzsche has a big moustache could have no general life-preserving utility in the course of human evolution (although it could have life-preserving utility for a few in some quite weird circumstance). The beliefs which Nietzsche picks out are those that concern the existence of substance, matter, causality, etc., i.e., roughly those beliefs that Kant classified as synthetic a priori. Thus Nietzsche says: statement of this position we find in WP ?539: "Parmenides said, 'one cannot think of what is not'; - we are at the other extreme, and say 'what can be thought of must cer- tainly be a fiction.'" 546 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="23">The most strongly believed a priori "truths" are for me provisional assumptions; e.g., the law of causality, a very well acquired habit of belief, so much a part of us that not to believe in it would destroy the race. But are they for that reason truths? What a conclusion! As if the preservation of man were a proof of truth! (WP S497) Here Nietzsche claims merely that the life-preserving character of a belief is no proof of its truth. But in a number of places Nietzsche wishes to make the much stronger claim that these life-preserving truths are definitely false. This view is vividly expressed in Beyond Good and Evil 54 which is quoted here in toto: The falseness of a judgment is for us not necessarily an objection to a judgment; in this respect our new language may sound strangest. The question is to what extent it is life-pro- moting, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating. And we are fundamentally inclined to claim that the falsest judgments (which include the synthetic judg- ments a priori) are the most indispensable for us; that without accepting the fictions of logic, without measuring reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self- identical, without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers, man could not live - that renouncing false judgements would mean renouncing life and a denial of life. To recognize untruth as a condition of life - that certainly means resisting accustomed value feelings in a dangerous way; and a philosophy that risks this would by that token alone place itself beyond good and evil. The passages from The Gay Science and Beyond Good and Evil raise a number of questions, the important one for our purposes being: what reasons does Nietzsche have for claiming that certain kinds of entity do not exist (or that most of our beliefs about what exists are false)? One rea- son will be examined in part IV. In the remainder of this section it will be argued that these passages can best be understood within the context of a pragmatic theory of truth, or, more accurately, a pragmatic theory of belief. Such a theory applies, however, only to a certain class of proposi- tions, viz., "man's truths," and not to the class of propositions which encapsulate Nietzsche's world-conception. A realist correspondence theory of truth applies to both in that Nietzsche alleges that the former class of propositions are all false (illusory, erroneous) while the latter are true. The pragmatic theory of truth to which Nietzsche might be committed could be expressed in the following way. (PT) For a class K of propositions, of which p is a member, p is prag- matically true if and only if there is utility in the belief that p. To some extent this does capture some of the claims Nietzsche wishes to make about truth. First, for Nietzsche the primary bearer of truth or fal- sity is a proposition, or as he more commonly says, a judgment, a belief or an assertion. Second, the kind of utilities that Nietzsche has in mind are NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 547</page><page sequence="24">those which are life-preserving, power-enhancing and species-procreat- ing. Third, Nietzsche needs to restrict the class of propositions to which (PT) applies because not all propositions are pragmatically true; this amounts to specifying the class of "man's truths." Already we have noted that Nietzsche intends his remarks to apply to synthetic a priori (or just a priori) propositions, and so class K can be taken to include them. How- ever it is unclear how extensive K is meant to be. It could include any proposition whose truth presupposes Kantian synthetic a priori proposi- tions and thus propositions about ordinary objects could be included in K. This is something that Nietzsche clearly intends when he wishes to include our ordinary everyday remarks amongst the class of pragmatic truths. Also included in K are those existence claims that we have taken to be true but which are dismissed as false in the passages just cited from The Gay Science and Beyond Good and Evil; and we would have to include in K any proposition that presupposed these false existence claims. Thus K turns out to be an extensive class, but its full extent is left undetermined. Whether Nietzsche intends something like a definition of truth such as (PT) above is not always clear. Nietzsche does claim on some occasions that utility is at least sufficient, if not necessary and sufficient, for truth when he says "utility alone is truth." The full context is: Exactly the same thing could have happened with the categories of reason: they could have prevailed, after much groping and fumbling, through their relative utility. There came a point when one collected them together, raised them to consciousness as a whole . . . From then on, they counted as a priori, as beyond experience, as irrefutable. And yet perhaps they represent nothing more than the expediency of a certain race and species - their utility alone is their "truth" - (WP ?514). Again in support of this interpretation Nietzsche speaks of a "criterion of truth" by which he means necessary and sufficient conditions for truth: The aberration of philosophy is that, instead of seeing in logic and the categories of reason means toward the adjustment of the world for utilitarian ends (basically, toward an expedi- ent falsification), one believed one possessed in them the criterion of truth and reality. The "criterion of truth" was in fact merely the biological utility of such a system of systematic falsification; and since a species of animals knows of nothing more important than its own preservation, one might indeed be permitted to speak here of "truth" (WP ?584). Like many philosophers who do not really mean true when they use the word "true," Nietzsche makes use of shudder quotation-marks. By this device Nietzsche underlines the point that truth is to be construed not as correspondence but as utility (of a life-preserving sort). Other remarks of Nietzsche's suggest that he holds a pragmatic theory of belief rather than of truth. This is evident where he considers holding- true or believing as more fundamental than truth. Consider the following (somewhat ungrammatical) notebook remarks: 548 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="25">Believing is the primal beginning even in every sense impression: a kind of affirmation the first intellectual activity! A "holding-true" in the beginning! Therefore it is to be explained: how "holding-true" arose! What sensation lies behind "true"? (WP 55o6) The valuation "I believe that this and that is so" as the essence of "truth. " In valuations are expressed conditions of preservation and growth. . . . Trust in reason and its categories, in dialectic, therefore the valuation of logic, proves only their usefulness for life, proved by experience - not that something is true. That a great deal of belief must be present; that judgments may be ventured; that doubt concerning all essential values is lacking - that is the precondition of every living thing and its life. Therefore, what is needed is that something must be held to be true - not that something is true. (WP ?507) But what is truth? Perhaps a kind of belief that has become a condition of life? (WP ?53z). These remarks suggest that, for creatures such as ourselves with an evo- lutionary history which has provided us with certain sensory organs and a mental development sufficient for belief-formation, holding certain beliefs is a necessary condition for our continued existence. We could call this the "pragmatic belief condition" and express it thus: (PBC) For a class of creatures C (of which c is an instance) there is a class of propositions K such that c's believing each member of K (or c's holding each member of K to be true) is a necessary con- dition for c's continued survival. (PBC) is a thesis about the causal consequences of the act of holding cer- tain propositions true. It says nothing about what content is expressed by them, what items they must be about or what truth-value they must have. (This will be touched on subsequently.) In virtue of the life-preserving utility of holding these beliefs we may abstract out the belief-contents themselves and honorifically dub them "true." In this case (PBC) is a more fundamental thesis and (PT) is a derivative one. The interpretation of Nietzsche's views to be adopted here is that he is committed to a prag- matic theory of truth only in the derivative sense just explained. This interpretation still leaves open the possibility that the belief-contents themselves be false, as Nietzsche maintains; and this is desirable as the formulation of (PBC), and the derivative (PT), should not initially rule out this possibility given the importance Nietzsche attaches to it. Is (PBC) itself true? This can only mean: is (PBC) true in the correspon- dence theory sense of "true" and not some pragmatic sense of "true" (as outlined in (PT))? What is being asked is whether it is a necessary condi- tion of the existence of creatures such as ourselves that we hold certain beliefs, viz., those of class K. An affirmative answer to the question would then successfully extend Nietzsche's naturalism to our belief-holding capacities and assign them a necessary life-preserving function. In addi- NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 549</page><page sequence="26">tion it would be possible to incorporate a theory of human beings with their particular belief-forming capacities within the framework of a theory of N-force-powers as outlined in part I. How could (PBC) be tested? One inductivist line is as follows. Consider a particular creature A with belief-forming capacities (e.g., a particular human being) and a par- ticular proposition p which is one of the central propositions of class K (i.e., p is one of Kant's synthetic a priori propositions that Nietzsche selects for critical attack). Then a particular instance of (PBC) will be of the form: A's believing p is a necessary condition for A's continued existence. Such a claim has clear truth-conditions and a reasonably clear method of test. Whatever the outcome of the test of each particular instance, the truth of (PBC) depends on the truth of a large number of such particular instances. If (PBC) turns out to be true, it will be true in virtue of a certain causally necessary condition holding in the world. The correspondence theory of truth is necessary to give an account of the sense in which (PBC) is true, and thereby to underpin the doctrine of naturalism so important to Nietzsche's conception of human beings. This interpretation of Nietzsche readily yields an account of some of his remarks that otherwise would remain perverse or puzzling. Consider first his remarks about "the will to truth": The criterion of truth resides in the enhancement of the feeling of power. (WP ?534) The fictitious world of subject, substance, "reason," etc., is needed -: there is in us a power to order, simplify, falsify, artificially distinguish. "Truth" is the will to be master over the multiplicity of sensations. (WP 55I7) . . .the "sense for truth" will have to legitimize itself before another tribunal: - as a means of the preservation of man, as will to power. (WP S495) The inventive force that invented categories laboured in the service of our needs, namely of our need for security, for quick understanding on the basis of signs and sounds, for means of abbreviation: - "substance," "subject," "object," "being," "becoming" have nothing to do with metaphysical truths. - It is the powerful who made the names of things into law, and among the powerful it is the greatest artists in abstraction who created the categories. (WP S5s3) The (PBC) thesis tells us only that, for a given species, holding certain beliefs is necessary for their survival. The thesis does not tell us anything about the processes of belief-formation or of concept creation. However the above remarks show that these are linked to Nietzsche's theory of N-force-powers. Each creature, including each human being, is a centre 550 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="27">for a certain quantity of N-force-power, the quantity varying from crea- ture to creature. On the part of some creatures, "the greatest artists in abstraction," their N-power is-such that they can create those very beliefs necessary for survival; ". . . there is a will to power in the organic process by virtue of which dominant, shaping, commanding forces continually extend the bounds of their power. . . ." (WP 5644). Belief-formation is part of this exercise of power within organic processes. Once the beliefs have been invented and it turns out that holding these beliefs has life-pre- serving utility then the species as a whole comes to hold these beliefs. Because of their life-preserving utility these belief-contents are dubbed "true." Also because of the creative use of power in the invention of these "truths" and the vastly increased extent of our powers as the result of holding these "truths" Nietzsche feels he can say that the "criterion of truth" is linked to the will to power as it operates within ourselves to produce beliefs conducive to our survival. Thus the four quotations above can be understood as hypothesizing a link between the will to power as it operates in beliefs which will both enable us to survive as a species and to exercise greater power in the environment in which we live. In this context we can also place Nietzsche's talk of "creating a world" for ourselves: One should not understand this compulsion to construct concepts, species, forms, purposes, laws ("a world of identical cases") as if they enable us to fix the real world; but as a compul- sion to arrange a world for ourselves in which our existence is made possible: - we thereby create a world which is calculable, simplified, comprehensible, etc., for us. (WP 5XzI) Will to truth is a making firm, a making true and durable, an abolition of the false character of things, a reinterpretation of it into beings. "Truth" is therefore not something there, that might be found or discovered - but something that must be created and that gives a name to a process, or rather to a will to overcome that has in itself no end - introducing truth, as a processes in infinitum, an active determining - not a becoming-conscious of something that is in itself firm and determined. It is a word for the "will to power." (WP 5 5z) We can comprehend only a world that we ourselves have made. (WP S495) The life-preserving beliefs we dub "true" are, unlike correspondence truths, not found or discovered. Rather they are beliefs made by those of us who have sufficient power to invent life-preserving beliefs and are beliefs held by the rest of us because of their life-enhancing powers. But in what sense do these beliefs "make a world".) So far we have not considered either the content expressed in the life-preserving beliefs we hold or the truth-value of these beliefs. If we are to take the above remarks about "making a world" literally then the truth-value of the beliefs is not a relevant consideration but what is expressed in their content is relevant. NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 551</page><page sequence="28">Whatever real world we do inhabit, the world we think we live in is the world as characterized by the contents of beliefs which we must hold because of their life-preserving utility for us. As has already been noted, Nietzsche insists that these beliefs are nearly always about enduring objects, things or substances, identical cases, causal relations, and so on. Without such beliefs our survival would not be possible. Thus the world we think there is, is a primordially postulated world of enduring objects, things, substances, identical cases, causal relations, etc. But the real world is not the way our life-preserving beliefs depict it; rather, Nietzsche alleges, it is a world of N-force-powers as outlined in part I. He maintains that his important discovery is that in order to survive we must depict the world differently from how it is. Nietzsche puts this in a slogan: "To impose upon becoming the character of being - that is the supreme will to power" (WP ?617). Thus humans have invented their own world of being through the system of beliefs they must hold in order to survive, This gives some specific content to the class of propositions K which humans must believe in accordance with (PBC). But the world is not one of beings - it is one of becoming, i.e., a system of N-force-powers. IV. Reduction versus Elimination of Ordinary Objects. We must now address Nietzsche's claim that the life-preserving beliefs we hold are false. In what sense, if any, is this claim true? So far a number of passages have been quoted in which it is quite clear that Nietzsche holds the view that such beliefs are false. Yet in other passages, to be mentioned shortly, it seems that Nietzsche maintains the opposite view. It would be too easy to dismiss Nietzsche's views as inconsistent. Rather it will be argued that Nietzsche vacillates between two interpretations of the status of our life-preserving beliefs without being able to come to a clear decision about which is correct. The two interpretations will emerge in the course of discussing two issues that raise, in a pointed way, problems for each of the suggested interpretations. (a) First consider the organizational unities which are complexes of N-force-power that Nietzsche alleges exist. These were discussed at the beginning of part III. Are the ordinary objects that we take to exist, such as tables, trees, persons and lakes the same as, or different from, organiza- tional unities of N-force-power? It would be strange if these organiza- tional unities loomed large in the world yet we did not countenance them in any way in order to facilitate our survival. So it seems plausible to say that ordinary objects do exist but, contrary to appearances, they are really complexes of N-force-powers. This would tend to undercut Nietzsche's claim that our ordinary existence beliefs are false. There is an instructive parallel in the philosophy of mind for this difficulty in Nietzsche. 5 52. ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="29">- Two significantly different versions of materialism in the philosophy of mind can be found in the current literature - the identity theory and the eliminative or disappearance theory (championed by Feyerabend and Rorty).34 Those who adopt the identity theory of mind and body are con- servationist with respect to ontology. They wish to maintain the view that our ordinary belief that there are events or processes such as sensory experience, pains, feelings, thinkings, etc., is a correct belief. However, we are wrong to think that these processes must be mental; we mistake the kind of thing they are even though we are correct in thinking that there are such processes. On the identity theory each of these processes is alleged to be identical with some physical process. Mental processes are thus con- served within the ontology of physical processes; they are not rejected as being an ontological fiction we have inherited from our ancestors' talk of some alleged mental realm. For the sake of a label this conservationist view will be called "reductive realism." It is realistic in that we are correct when we claim that there are such things as mental processes; it is reduc- tive in that we were wrong to think that there is a separate ontological cat- egory of the mental for, by virtue of the identity theory, mental processes have been reduced to physical processes. We could interpret Nietzsche as a reductive realist with respect to ordi- nary objects such as tables, chairs, persons and puddles of water; on Nietzsche's theory each turns out to be identical to some complex of N-force-powers. On this interpretation, even if ordinary objects turn out upon investigation to be complexes of items of some quite unfamiliar ontology such as that of N-force-powers (or quarks or warps in space- time as is suggested by recent physics), this would not entail the falsity of our pre-investigatory claims that such items exist. Our reference to such objects in our ordinary talk, and the truth-value of our de re beliefs in the existence of such objects, remains invariant under discoveries about the make-up of such objects. Thus the position is realist in that ordinary objects do exist, but reductive in that there is not a separate category of ordinary objects distinct from complexes of N-force-power. However the reductive realist interpretation of Nietzsche is uncongenial in one impor- tant respect. He maintains that our belief in the existence of ordinary objects is false; so, such objects cannot be conserved within the ontology of N-force-powers as this identity version of reductive realism would require. 34 See Paul Feyerabend, "Materialism and the Mind-Body Problem," Review of Meta- physics, Vol. I7, i963; R. Rorty, "Mind-Body Identity, Privacy and Categories," Review of Metaphysics, Vol. i', I965, and "In Defense of Eliminative Materialism," Review of Metaphysics, Vol. z4, 1970. NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 553</page><page sequence="30">Those who adopt an eliminative (or disappearance) theory of mental processes espouse the same materialist ontology as the identity theorist but they give a quite different account of the status of the mental. In fact they grant to the mental no status at all. They claim that there are no such things as mental processes and that statements such as "I am having a yel- lowish sensory experience," "I am in pain," and "I am thinking about Vienna" are all strictly false. A number of considerations have been advanced by eliminative materialists for this view, not all of equal merit. Only two of their arguments will be mentioned here largely because of their bearing on the interpretation of Nietzsche to be offered subse- quently. Eliminative materialists with respect to the mental can be viewed as, first of all, arguing for an interim claim, viz., no mental processes can be physical processes. Two considerations lead to this. First, they reject the claim that any particular mental process can be identical to any partic- ular physical process, i.e., they hold that (Vx) (Vy) [(x is a mental process) * (y is a physical process) D - (x = y)]. The interim claim follows directly from this, viz., (Vx) [(x is a mental process) D - (x is a physical process)]. Second, some eliminative materialists might claim that there is a strong conceptual link between being a mental process and being an immaterial item, i.e., they claim that the proposition that all mental processes are immaterial (i.e., non-physical) items is some kind of analytic truth. Add to this the evident truth that no physical process is an immaterial item and the interim claim follows once more. Now conjoin to the interim claim the materialist thesis that there are only physical processes and the desired conclusion that there are no mental processes readily follows. Since experiences, pains and thinkings are held to be mental processes then the three sentences above, and any others like them, turn out to be false. This two-pronged argument may not be the only way eliminative mate- rialists could argue for their view about the status of mental processes. What is clear is that they eliminate mental processes from their ontology. They do not attempt, as does the reductive realist, to conserve or incorpo- rate mental processes within their general physicalist ontology. We could call this position "eliminative fictionalism" with respect to the mental. It is eliminative in that mental processes are not conserved within the mate- rialists' ontological framework but are rejected from it. It is fictionalist to emphasize that the rejected mental processes have no ontological status whatever since the materialist's ontology includes all the things that exist; in the ultimate accounting of all that there is, mental items will not be included any more than fictional characters will be included in any accounting of all the people that have actually existed. 554 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="31">There is a difficulty for the eliminative fictionalist with respect to the mental that is worth mentioning for its bearing on our understanding of Nietzsche when we come to interpret him as an eliminative fictionalist with respect to ordinary objects. It seems most obviously correct to us that there are mental processes such as sensory experiences, pains, thinkings, etc. To deny that these exist is strongly counter-intuitive. So we should reject some of the premises from which this conclusion followed. For example, the second prong of the argument to the interim premise involved the claim that it is analytically true that all mental processes are immaterial. This claim of philosophical analysis may be much less secure than the common sense claim that there are mental processes; so the philosophical claim seems to be the one that ought to be abandoned. The reductive realist tries to preserve our common sense belief that there are mental processes while at the same time being a materialist about the mind. This brings out an important difference between the two material- ists. Reductivists hold that common sense is correct when it alleges that there are mental processes. But common sense errs in holding that these must be mental; we can be mistaken about the nature of even the most evi- dent, such as mental processes, while continuing to talk of them. In con- trast eliminativists do not give up the belief that mental processes are gen- uinely immaterial items; instead they give up the common sense belief that there are mental processes. This is forced on them by their materialism; there can be no non-material items in our final accounting of what there is. Eliminative fictionalism with respect to ordinary objects seems to be a more congenial viewpoint from which to interpret some of Nietzsche's remarks about the status of ordinary objects. He alleges that there are only N-force-powers and complexes of these. There are no ordinary items such as tables, chairs and persons and thus our belief in their existence is false. Rather than conserve the ontology of our ordinary beliefs within the ontology of N-force-powers by means of a reductive realist approach (employing the identity theory) Nietzsche rejects that ontology by adopt- ing the approach of an eliminative fictionalist. Like the eliminativist in the philosophy of mind who denies what we take to be an obvious truth, viz., that there are mental processes, so Nietzsche denies what we take to be an obvious truth, viz., that there are ordinary objects." " There are some contemporary eliminative fictionalists with respect to ordinary objects. Thus 'W. Sellars says: "On the view I propose, the assertion that the micro-entities of physical theory really exist goes hand in hand with the assertion that the macro-entities of the perceptible world do not really exist. This position can be ruled out of court only by showing that the framework of perceptible physical objects in space and time has an authenticity which guarantees a parasitical status for the subtle and sophisticated frame- work of physical theory. I argue in chapter 5 that the very conception of such absolute NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 555</page><page sequence="32">So far we have not considered why Nietzsche thinks that our ordinary existence beliefs are false. We have merely suggested that an eliminative fictionalist approach to Nietzsche's remarks provides, so far, a congenial interpretation of those remarks. Is there an argument in Nietzsche which parallels that of the eliminative fictionalist with respect to the mental? None explicitly occurs. But a reconstruction of his position can be given and evidence sought for it in his writings. Although there is evidence some of it is equivocal; this is because Nietzsche's own position turns out to be equivocal as he never fully worked out arguments supporting it. The fol- lowing is a Nietzschean parallel to the eliminative materialist argument. Nietzsche wishes to conclude that there are no ordinary objects. An interim premise on the way to this conclusion would be: (I) Whatever is an ordinary object is not a N-force-power, or a complex of N-force-powers. If we add to (I) the claim that there are only N-force-powers, or complexes of them, then the conclusion that there are no ordinary objects clearly fol- lows. But what reason do we have to hold (I)? There are two arguments to this conclusion that could be considered. The first is most direct. It involves a rejection of the claim that any par- ticular ordinary object is identical to any particular complex of N-force- powers; i.e., the following is held true: (Vx) (Vy) [(x is an ordinary object) * (y is a complex of N-force-powers) D - (x = y)]. From this (I) follows, viz., (Vx) [x is an ordinary object D - (x is a complex of N-force-pow- ers)I; thus the desired conclusion that there are no ordinary objects easily follows. Even though Nietzsche holds this conclusion we have seen that there is evidence in his writings that he also holds the claim that ordinary objects are identical to complexes of N-force-power. Further evidence that Nietzsche supports this identity claim will appear shortly in (b). So either this is an unsatisfactory interpretation of Nietzsche's reasons for his desired conclusion or there is some confusion in Nietzsche over whether or not he should support the identity claim. A full discussion of Nietzsche's views on the nature of identity lies outside the scope of this paper. But, briefly, he held the view that identity was something that we as knowers impose on the flux of becoming in order to make a world condu- cive to our survival; the identity relation cannot hold between items in the world."6 Given such a view of identity it might seem plausible to conjec- authenticity is a mistake." (p. 96 of Science, Perception and Reality [London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, I963]). 36 See the text to footnote 3 3 and the footnote itself for some of Nietzsche's views on iden- tity. In the WP S?zo Nietzsche also says: "The principle of identity has behind it the 'apparent fact' of things that are the same. A world in a state of becoming could not, in a strict sense, be 'comprehended' or 'known'; only to the extent that the 'comprehending' 556 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="33">ture that Nietzsche would not want to claim that identity relations could hold between objects and collections of N-force-power; but Nietzsche would be wrong to reject such a claim. The second argument is this: (I) All ordinary object are substances or bits of matter. (z) If anything is an N-force-power, or complex of N-force-pow- ers, then it is not a substance or a bit of matter. ..(I) Whatever is an ordinary object is not an N-force-power, or a complex of N-force powers. Premise (z) has already been established in part I; N-force-powers, and complexes of them are not substances or material-like. Premise (i) does seem an evident conceptual truth. We do regard ordinary objects as rela- tively enduring items which possess some kind of unity over time. How- ever, the identity conditions for ordinary objects are somewhat problem- atic, the theory of substance and the theory of matter having been invented, in part, to give an account of such conditions. It would not be unreasonable, then, to see a strong conceptual link between being an ordi- nary object and being a substance. This much, Nietzsche agreed, was an important part of the traditional metaphysical theory of ordinary objects but so much the worse for traditional metaphysics he would add! The second argument for eliminative fictionalism with respect to ordi- nary objects has more support in Nietzsche's writings than the first. Yet the two arguments are not unrelated. To support the second but not the first is to fail to fully grasp what the identity claim really means. This is all too easy to do when the reductive and the eliminative approaches are not fully distinguished. Thus in discovering, upon analysis, that ordinary objects are really complexes of items of some quite different ontological status it is all too easy to conclude that there are really no ordinary objects. But the claim that there are really no ordinary objects can be understood in either a reductive realist or an eliminative fictionalist way. It seems as if Nietzsche vacillated between these two approaches in claiming that there really are no ordinary objects without fully appreciating the quite distinc- tive character of each. (b) The second important issue that needs to be settled before we can arrive at a satisfactory interpretation of Nietzsche's views is this. There is an obvious objection to the claim that our life-preserving beliefs are false. and 'knowing' intellect encounters a coarse, already-created world, fabricated out of mere appearances but become firm to the extent that this kind of appearance has pre- served life - only to this extent is there anything like 'knowledge'; i.e., a measuring of earlier and later errors by one another." NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 557</page><page sequence="34">Our beliefs, if they are to have any utility, especially life-preserving utility, must either be true or have a high degree of verisimilitude. False beliefs when employed in any calculation to achieve the goal of preserving our existence will tend to decrease the chances of our achieving that goal while true beliefs would increase the chance. Thus false beliefs cannot, in gen- eral, have life-preserving utility. If a belief has helped us to survive then that belief must either be true or have a quite high degree of verisimilitude. Nietzsche seems to recognise the force of this argument in a number of places. Thus he says quite significantly: In order for a particular species to maintain itself and increase its power, its conception of reality must comprehend enough of the calculable and constant for it to base a scheme of behaviour on it. The utility of preservation - not some abstract-theoretical need not to be deceived - stands as the motive behind the development of the organs of knowledge - they develop in such a way that their observations suffice for our preservation. In other words: the measure of the desire for knowledge depends upon the measure to which the will to power grows in a species: a species grasps a certain amount of reality in order to become master of it, in order to press it into service. (WP ?480) This quotation tends to take us in the direction of a reductive realist interpretation of Nietzsche's views rather than an eliminative fictionalist one. Nietzsche speaks of "a species grasping a certain amount of reality." In the case of creatures who form beliefs (e.g., ourselves) this can only mean "forming beliefs which are true in the sense of corresponding with some bit of reality." Such correspondence must entail at least that the names, proper or general, in the sentences we use to express these beliefs do refer to entities in the world. These entities we take to be individual objects in the case of proper names, or kinds or sorts in the case of general terms (such as 'water', 'tree', 'food', etc.). However, in Nietzsche's ontol- ogy only N-force-powers or complexes of these exist. So the entities we refer to when we use proper names or general terms must be N-force- powers or complexes of these. Thus if we are to "grasp a certain amount of reality" our beliefs must latch onto reality in the sense that at least some proper-names and general terms we employ possess a denotation. We may be wrong about the kind of entity these denotata are, but this in no way impugns the fact that such terms have denotata. Whatever we take our terms to denote, the reductive realist interpretation of Nietzsche's remarks guarantees that the denotation remains invariant despite any change in our belief about what kind of entity is denoted. In contrast, the eliminative fictionalist interpretation of Nietzsche's remarks cannot preserve the claim that we "grasp a certain amount of reality." On that interpretation what we refer to is either an ordinary object, a substance or a bit of matter. These are not to be identified with 558 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="35">any N-force-power or complex of N-force powers. Thus our proper names and general terms fail to denote anything. Consequently our ordi- nary terms fail to hook into any piece of reality. It is this consequence of eliminative fictionalism that is strongly counter-intuitive. Nietzsche clearly recognizes this when he says that any species, including ourselves, must in "its conception of reality comprehend enough of the calculable and constant" in order to exercise its powers of practical reasoning in order to preserve its existence. Without some true beliefs we fail to become "masters of reality" and are unable to "press it into service." True beliefs require successful reference to some actually existing entities. So not all our beliefs about what exists can be false in the global way Nietzsche alleges. Nietzsche does not make clear what he means by "comprehending enough of the calculable and constant" so that we can successfully plan our actions. This remark seems to suggest that there are in the world some constant items with features that admit quantification in some respect thereby facilitating calculation, e.g., the distance, number, size, etc., of some items such as predators, food, and so on. Nietzsche makes similar remarks elsewhere in The Will to Power, but with a choice of language that hints that he might resist this suggestion: Not "to know" but to schematize - to impose upon chaos as much regularity and form as our practical needs require. In the formation of reason, logic, the categories, it was need that was authoritative: the need, not to "know," but to subsume, to schematize, for the purpose of intelligibility and calculation . . . . No pre-existing "idea" was here at work, but the utilitarian fact that only when we see things coarsely and made equal do they become calcu- lable and usable to us. (WP ?S5 i) Logic is the attempt to comprehend the actual world by means of a scheme of being posited by ourselves; more correctly, to make it formulatable and calculable for us. (WP ? 516) In these passages logic and the categories of thought are regarded as a scheme that we impose on the actual world (or, as Nietzsche says, on chaos, a world of N-force-powers); we do not find the scheme as a ready- made feature of the world. The word 'impose' is tricky in this context. Does this mean that there are already existing entities (i.e., complexes of N-force-powers) which we are capable of perceiving and which we then classify in accordance with a scheme which has life-preserving utility? Such an interpretation of what is meant by 'impose' fits best a reductive realist interpretation of Nietzsche. But there is a stronger sense of 'impose' in which both our invention of objects and our classification of them is alleged to have life-preserving utility. This stronger sense is implied in the already cited remark that we "impose upon becoming the character of NIETZSCHE S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 5 59</page><page sequence="36">being" (WP ?617) and accords with the eliminative fictionalist interpreta- tion of Nietzsche. What we impose on the world in the way of ordinary objects, substances, bits of matter and kinds or sorts of object is not some- thing that is to be found in the world; what we impose is some primordi- ally posited fiction alleged by Nietzsche to be necessary for our survival as a species. Whatever interpretation of these remarks we adopt one common thread is that we need to form beliefs which at least make calculation pos- sible so that we can act correctly to preserve our lives. Talk of calculation rather than truth suggests that we should take an instrumentalist interpre- tation of these beliefs. Instrumentalists in science prescind from making any claim about the truth (or the falsity) of their scientific theories. They are interested in theories only in so far as they are calculating devices which are successful in that they yield true observational predictions. We could interpret Nietzsche's life-preserving beliefs in an instrumen- talistic way. The entire set of beliefs is to be regarded as the theory from which we make our predictions. Interpreting these beliefs instrumentally can be understood to mean that these beliefs are about purely fictional items (such as ordinary objects); however these fictional items are such that we can make calculations from them which yield, hopefully, success- ful predictions. This seems to be an attractive interpretation of Nietzsche's position - except for one important objection. For a scientific theory interpreted instrumentally success is a matter of yielding true predictions from the theory. What is the analogue of a true prediction for Nietzsche's instrumentally interpreted ordinary beliefs? These beliefs will be successful if life is preserved. Thus the analogue of a true prediction will be that a particular creature (or a particular species) which holds these beliefs, has in fact survived. Thus we must admit, contrary to what Nietzsche says, that ordinary statements such as "particular creature c survives" or "particular species s survives" are true (in a correspondence theory sense of "true"). Without such truths we cannot make sense of the claim that our instrumentally interpreted ordinary beliefs are successful. Thus some of our ordinary beliefs must be true in a correspondence sense and not just a pragmatic sense of "true." This might seem an important objection to an instrumentalist interpretation of all our ordinary beliefs, but not an objection to an instrumentalist interpretation for some chosen subclass of these beliefs. But without an instrumentalist interpretation of at least some of our ordinary beliefs it seems hard to make sense of the role Nietzsche assigns the calculations we allegedly make to preserve our lives. Nietzsche is strongly instrumentalist with respect to physics, especially the mechanistic atomism he found in the sciences of his day: 560 ROBERT NOLA</page><page sequence="37">It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that physics, too, is only an interpretation and exegesis of the world (to suit us, if I may say so!) and not a world-explanation; but insofar as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more - namely, as an explanation. (BGE ?I4) Physicists believe in a true world in their own fashion: a firm systematization of atoms in necessary motion. . . . But they are in error. The atom they posit is . . . itself a subjective fiction. (WP ?636) Given that Nietzsche is a committed realist with respect to his ontology of N-force-powers then either mechanistic atomism is reducible (in some sense) to Nietzsche's theory, or else it must be construed instrumentalisti- cally. Nietzsche opts for the latter. Since our ordinary life-preserving beliefs are alleged by Nietzsche to be as false a view of the world as mecha- nistic atomism then they, too, are ripe for an instrumentalistic interpreta- tion. So it does seem appropriate to view our ordinary, but false, beliefs as instruments for making calculations which lead to our preservation. Such an interpretation of Nietzsche's remarks faces an objection com- monly urged against all forms of instrumentalism. Instrumentalistically interpreted theories cannot explain the extent to which they are success- ful. Their success is a miracle. Realists have an explanation of the success of their theories. Because in our theory we have latched, in part, on to how the world really is we can explain the success of our predictions.37 Simi- larly for Nietzsche. If all our ordinary life-preserving beliefs are false then that we manage to survive employing these beliefs seems a miracle. The realist in Nietzsche pulls him in the direction of saying that we need to "grasp a certain amount of reality" or "comprehend enough of the calcu- lable and constant" in order to survive. That we do manage to latch onto a bit of reality in our ordinary beliefs serves to explain why we have success- fully survived so far. In sum the issues raised under (a) and (b) can best be expressed as fol- lows. If we combine the eliminativist and instrumentalist tendencies in Nietzsche's philosophy we can regard him as proposing a form of elimina- tive instrumentalism with respect to our ordinary beliefs. There is no ontology of objects, substances or matter as is presupposed by our ordi- nary beliefs but these beliefs are instrumentally successful in helping us preserve our lives. However there is a realist tension that takes Nietzsche away from being an eliminativist to being a reductive realist. Our ordinary beliefs do connect us with entities in the world but these entities are quite different from what we take them to be - they are in fact com- 37 Such an argument is advanced at the beginning of Hilary Putnam's "What Is Realism?" (reprinted in J. Leplin, ed., Scientific Realism [Berkeley: University of California Press, I1984]). NIETZSCHE'S THEORY OF TRUTH AND BELIEF 56i</page><page sequence="38">plexes of N-force-power. That our beliefs connect us with bits of reality is part of an explanation of why holding such beliefs has life-preserving util- ity. The tensions between eliminative instrumentalism and reductive real- ism remain unresolved in Nietzsche's thought. 56X ROBERT NOLA</page></plain_text>
