These populations created different types of industries, ranging from assemblages of small arti facts and industries with simple pebble tools to standardized units such as the Evolved Acheulean and the Early Mousterian. The industries of the Last Interglacial (Taubachian) show some regression in technological standard ization and a reappearance of small artifacts. Other aspects of cultural adap tation (settlements, dwellings, hunting activity, symbolic and aesthetic expressions) are also summarized. It is suggested that the impact of climate and climatic changes on human settlement and behavior was greater in Central Europe (where two glaciations advancedfrom both north and south) than in the Mediterranean and Western Europe. The general trend of cultural evolution was toward greater technological and social complexity, but its course was not unilinear.

Of all the various interacting subsystems?hunting gathering techniques and economies, social organization, information exchange and storage, rituals and art, protection by dwellings, clothing, and fire, and so forth?it is the adaptation in artifacts which is best documented in the archaeological record. This paper is a brief review of the industries and of the associated archaeological evidence from Central Europe, dated within the period of about 700,000-100,000 B.P., that is, from the Middle and Early Upper Pleistocene; earlier finds are exceptional (Fig. 1). This provides the cultural background for the several human fossils from Mauer, Steinheim, Vertesszolos, Bilzingsleben, Ehringsdorf, Lebenstedt, Ganovce, and Taubach. STRATIGRAPHY The classic frameworks of the Alpine and Nordic Pleistocene chro nologies have not yet been replaced by more precise general systems. On the contrary, contemporary research is directed toward the elaboration of local stratigraphic sequences rather than toward their correlation. This situation is reflected in the regionally oriented arrangement of this article (Figs. 2 and 3). Southern Moravia The stratigraphic system of the southern Moravian Paleolithic is based primarily on fluviatile sediments and loess sections. The fluviatile sediments in the area of the Brno basin have been divided into several stratigraphic units (Zeman, 1982). The earliest level (the Lisen terrace) has a minimal age of 2.5 million years (Koci, 1982); it is followed by the older gravel and sand cover, including the Stranska skala terrace, and the younger gravel and sand cover, which has five stratigraphic members. (See Table I for the stratigraphic correlation and probable ages of sites in Central Europe and Table II for the stratigraphy of the Czechoslovakian sites.) The loess sections are interstratified with soil complexes, or pedo complexes, numbered consecutively from top to bottom PK I to PK XII ("Pedokomplex I-XII") (Smolikova, 1984). At the site of Brno-Cerveny kopec, the lower part of the younger gravel and sand cover is covered by an important loess section. At its base are the paleosols, PK X and PK Xa, and</page><page sequence="4">Table I.

A pebble core was found in this lower part of the section, which is probably of reversed polarity, al though there has been no direct paleomagnetic measurement of the actual find-spot (Fig. 4, 1) (Valoch, 1977a); paleosol PK Va has yielded additional flakes (Klima, 1963; Valoch, 1977a).

A quartz core (Fig. 4, 2) was found in the PK VI level at Sedlesovice (Valoch, 1981).

The Matuyama-Brunhes boundary was found at the base of the slope sediments (Layer 18); the underlying sediments go back to the Jaramillo event at about 900,000 years ago (Koci, 1982). The fauna from the slope sediments and from the caves dates to the Upper Biharian (Musil, 1982). The possibility of the presence of humans at this site has been discussed since the first discovery of fauna early in this century. The lithics are fragments of local chert which show no clear traces of working, except for a few possible flakes from the small Cave No. 8. Valoch (1987) has argued that some specimens are made on a chert which is slightly different from that available at the site or on fluviatile pebbles. Transportation by natural processes must be excluded if we are to accept this as proof of human activity. There are several types of chert at different levels within the Stranska skala rock (Pfichystal, 1987), and our excavations on its top have revealed a river terrace as a possible source for the pebbles. Valoch's argument is also based upon indications of burning on three bones and a piece of chert. The earliest artifacts in the Kulna cave in the Moravian Karst date from the penultimate glaciation (Layer 14), although the more important archae ological horizon dates to the last interglacial (Layer 11).

Bohemia Soil units are of prime importance in the correlation and dating of most of the Bohemian Middle Pleistocene sites. An even earlier site, Beroun, is now known to have a complex succession of six Early Pleistocene pedocomplexes (not yet numbered) and slope deposits sandwiched between two terraces. Artifacts are being sought in this very early context, although the results are not yet convincing (Kovanda et a/., 1988).</page><page sequence="8">40 Svoboda Fig. 4. Earliest industries. (1) Brno-Cerveny kopec, soil complex PK X(?); (2) Sedlesovice, soil complex PK VI (Coll. Moravske muzeum, Brno.). The earliest accepted artifacts are related to brown-clay (Braunlehm) soils at Becov I, Section B (Fridrich and Smolikova, 1976) and at Prague Suchdol (Fridrich, 1976a); these soils are not likely to be younger than the Cromerian. The important site of Pfezletice (Sibrava et ai, 1979) lies in silts beneath the brown-clay sediments; the fauna from the site places it in the Upper Biharian (Templomhegy phase) and the most recent paleomagnetic dating would put it at 590,000-660,000 years (Sibrava et aL, 1979). More recent finds come from soils classified as PK VI at Karlstejn</page><page sequence="9">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 41 (Smolikova and Fridrich, 1984), which show the first appearance of the trend toward more microlithic artifacts. The PK V pedocomplex is related to artifacts found at Horky II (Fridrich, 1982) and at Sedlec (Kukla, 1961). The following pedocomplex, PK IV, yielded a specific industry at Becov I, Location A-III-6 (Fridrich and Smolikova, 1973), and an isolated artifact at Letky (Smolikova, 1968). Probable Acheulean assemblages were found at Horky I and Becov I, Location B-III-4, below the level of PK IV, in sediments corresponding to the antepenultimate glaciation (Fridrich, 1982). A younger group of Acheulean related industries occurred in sediments of the penultimate glaciation at Becov I, Locations A-III-5 and A-III-4 (Fridrich, 1982). The last interglacial (PK III) yielded lithic industries at Becov I, Locations A-III-3 and B-III-1 (Fridrich, 1982), at Sedlec (Kukla, 1961), and at Prague-Ladvi, where the sequence continues into the last glaciation (Vend and Smolikova, 1974). Study of the relationship of artifacts to river-terrace systems provides only indirect indications of age. However, Fridrich (1976a) suggested that there was an Early Acheulean phase related to the surface of the Mindelian terrace at Becov II. A much longer sequence was discovered by Zebera in the Melnik Basin, where pebble artifacts were found on the surfaces of eight different terrace levels, which, on the basis of geomorphology, were attributed to the period from "Donau" to "Riss" (Svoboda, 1983). The Middle Elbe-Saale Region The stratigraphy of the Middle Pleistocene sediments in this region has recently been discussed and summarized by Mania (1984). The interval between the Elster and the Saale glaciations is divided into two warm periods, Holstein and Domnitz. Holstein fluviatile sediments contain lithic industries characterized by large flakes (Wallendorf, Kleinwangen, and Memleben); they were originally classified as Clactonian but are now regarded as Early Acheulean. The most important archaeological finds dating to the Domnitz warm period have been excavated from the travertine sedimentary complex at Bilzingsleben (Mania et aL, 1980), where the lithic industry is of a specialized "microlithic,'&gt; character. The range of the amino acid and uranium-series dates is too large to provide a more precise chronological placement; the uranium-series dates are 228,000 (Harmon et al, 1980), 179,000-301,000 (Brunnacker et al., 1983) and 335,000-350,000 years (R. Protsch, personal communication). The first Evolved Acheulean assemblage in the whole of Central Europe</page><page sequence="10">42 Svoboda appears at the site of Markkleeberg (Baumann and Mania, 1983) and dates to the period of the Domnitz/Saale transition; the cultural layer was overlain by a Saale moraine. Later evolution of the Evolved Acheulean in this region is documented by finds from the river gravels of Saale age at Hundisburg. At Ehringsdorf, the new dates and the unusual characters of the faunal, floral, and archaeological data suggest that the finds at least from the Lower Travertines do not date to the last interglacial or the last glacial, as is supposed for the surrounding travertine series, but to an earlier (Rugen?) warm period (Jager and Heinrich, 1979). The new uranium-series dates are 102,000-244,000 (Brunnacker et al, 1983), 150,000-250,000 (Schwarcz, 1982), and 230,000 years (Blackweli and Schwarcz, 1986); the amino acid date is 114,000 years (R. Protsch, personal communication). The available absolute dates for other Thuringian travertine sites are as follows: Taubach, 111,000 and 116,000 years; Weimar, 115,000, 118,000, and 151,000 years; and Burgtonna, 101,000, 104,000, and 111,000 years (Brunnacker et al, 1983). All of these dates accord well with the position of the sites in the last interglacial. Rhineland The importance of the middle Rhine region has been recognized after intensive research there during recent years. The gravels of the Rhine and the Mosel, separated by a soil horizon, form the base of the Pleistocene deposits; the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary has been identified in the Mosel gravels. The overlying loess deposits include the sediments of six cold periods, separated by six pedocomplexes (at the sites of Karlich, Ariendorf, and Leutesdorf). Absolute dates have been obtained on the interstratified horizons of volcanic deposits. The first traces of human presence consist of a pebble-tool found at the base of the sequence, under the Rhine river gravels at Karlich (Layer A), artifacts from the gravels at Winningen and Koblenz-Bisholder (von Berg and Fiedler, 1983), and several flakes in the top of the Mosel gravels at Karlich (Layer Bb), above the Matuyama-Brunhes boundary. These finds may date between about 1,000,000 and 600,000 years ago (Boscheinen et al, 1984, p. 14). The next human occupation is related to the Ariendorf warm period (formerly dated to 320,000-350,000 B.P.) at Miesenheim (Boscheinen et al, 1984). At the beginning of the following cold period, occupation is known from Karlich, Layer H (Wurges, 1984), and from Ariendorf (the phthanite industry includes cores and sidescrapers). Cultural remains have also been found in a paleosol dated to the Karlich warm period (formerly dated to about 200,000-250,000 years) at the site of</page><page sequence="11">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 43 Karlich (Bosinski, 1983). The industry is composed of small quartz and quartzite flakes, sometimes retouched, and a few heavy artifacts. At Ariendorf, the loess of the following glaciation has yielded a living site with a lithic industry composed primarily of small quartz flakes (Bosinski et al, 1983a); loess of the same period at Karlich yielded a handax (Layer Ja). Occupations of the penultimate glaciation and the last interglacial (sometimes continuing into the last glaciation) are being studied on the tops of the Rhineland Pleistocene volcanoes (Bosinski et al, 1983b; Kroger, 1987; Schafer, 1987). In the Lower Rhine region, the key section is at the loess site of Rheindahlen (Thieme et al, 1981), where the most important archaeological levels are C-l (antepenultimate glaciation), B-5 (Acheulean?), B-3 (the Rheindahlen-type industry associated with clays of the penultimate glaciation), B-2 (an isolated Acheulean find), and B-l (a living site and lithic workshop in the top of the last interglacial Parahraunerde). Other Important Sites The Mauer fossil was related to faunas of "inter-Minder* and "Mindel Riss" age, but it was not directly associated with stone artifacts. A small chert artifact was found at Mauer in the same Lower Sand layer as the human mandible, but at a higher level, and there were several quartzite artifacts at the base of the layer (Mfiller-Beck, 1977). The Steinheim fossil most probably belongs to a more recent warm period ("inter-Riss"). Of the other known sites, we would particularly mention the travertine sites which have yielded small-sized or "microlithic" industries. The earliest one is Vertesszolos in Hungary (Kretzoi and Vertes, 1965), a Late Biharian site which was originally dated by uranium series to before 350,000 B.P. but now appears to be later (Schwarcz, 1982). Middle Pleistocene sites with similar industries include Bad Cannstatt near Stuttgart (Wagner, 1982), which has several uranium-series dates of about 225,000 years (Brunnacker et al, 1983), and probably Vysne Ruzbachy in Slovakia (Barta and Banesz, 1981). New uranium-series dates from Slovakian travertines (Hausmann and Brunnacker, 1986) have confirmed the Middle Pleistocene age of Vysne Ruzbachy (about 200,000) and Beharovce-Sobotisko (&gt; 206,900), but the relationships of the dated samples to the archaeological material are not known. Other travertine sites of Slovakia [Ganovce, Bojnice (Banesz, 1970; Barta and Banesz, 1981)] have yielded occupations of the last interglacial with uranium-series dates between 80,000 and 130,000 B.P. (Hausmann and Brunnacker, 1986); occupation sometimes continued into the last glaciation.</page><page sequence="12">44 Svoboda There are comparible sites in Hungary [Tata (Vertes, 1964), which dates to about 100,000 B.P. (Schwarcz and Skoflek, 1982)] and southern Germany (Untertiirkheim). The sites of Mnesice at Nove Mesto n. V. (Slovakia), Krakow-Zwierzyniec and Piekary (Poland), and the caves of Hunas and Balve (F.R.G.) inter alia are also important for comparative stratigraphy. In the adjacent part of the USSR, the stratified site of Korolevo, which is currently being investi gated by V. N. Gladilin, may provide new evidence concerning Acheulean Mousterian evolution. Most of the lithic industries have been found in deposits of the warmer periods, such as travertines, paleosols, and limnic sediments, which have permitted detailed studies of the sites and their ecologies. The earliest indus tries, including the characteristic small-sized industries as well as a variety of other, less well-defined forms, developed essentially in favorable interglacial environments. Artifacts are much more rarely found in "cold" deposits, such as loess (Kukla, 1961, p. 27). Evidence from the middle Elbe-Saale region (Markkleeberg and Hundisburg), from Rheindahlen (B-5, B-2), Karlich (Layer JA), Horky I, and Becov (A-III-5, A-III-4, B-III-4), suggests that at the end of the Middle Pleistocene, human occupation during cold periods (the penultimate and antepenultimate glaciations) become more intensive and was usually related to the Evolved Acheulean. By analogy, the numerous surface finds of Acheulean from Bohemia and the Federal and Democratic German Republics (Reutersruh, Becov IV, Stvolinky, and others) may also relate to these periods. STONE INDUSTRIES The transport of raw material was not frequent during the earliest periods, and the sources of favored rocks were often directly occupied, when they fulfilled the other requirements of an early hominid site. The Central European Highlands provide mainly coarse-grained rocks, such as phthanite, quartzite, limestone, and basalt, but there are also local sources of crypto crystalline rocks, such as jasper and chert. Pebbles from the river gravels were exploited as easily accessible secondary sources of raw material (quartz, quartzite, chert, and others) during all periods, but primary sources of quartzite were systematically sought out during the Acheulean (Fig. 3, 3). Several types of flint are found in primary and secondary sources on the North European Plain, and they occur redeposited by glaciers as far south as the margins of the Central European Highlands. The Plain itself does not seem to have been continuously settled before the Acheulean, but flints of moraine origin were already in use during pre-Acheulean times in the tran</page><page sequence="13">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 45 sitional zone between the Plain and the Highlands (at Wallendorf and Bilzingsleben). Many of the early industries of Central Europe have two components: heavy-duty tools (choppers, chopping tools, bifaces, cleavers, and picks) and light-duty tools (tools on flakes and smaller debris). Although the technology as a whole is consistent, the specific raw materials and techniques chosen for each component differ. Lithic technology has two stages: the production of blanks and the working of blanks (retouching, etc.). During the course of time, a new stage was introduced?core preparation?and this introduction was of key importance in stimulating technological standardization and progress. Some authorities (Fridrich, 1976b, 1982; Bosinski, 1982) use it as a boundary between the Lower and the Middle Paleolithic. Critical comparison of stone industries is complicated by objective factors (the various forces influencing their final form and shape) and by subjective factors, which involve both discrimination between artifacts and natural objects and different methodological approaches to the description and classification of the artifacts themselves. Standardization of artifacts developed through time and the earliest tools are often not morphologically standardized. There are, at present, two main types of approaches used by Central European scholars. The "classic" approaches are based on a type list (such as those of Bordes, Leakey, or Bosinski) and every piece is classified as a single technotypological unit. In contrast, the analytical approaches attempt to describe and analyze all the technotypological attributes of each piece and to study their association (Burdukiewicz et al, 1979; Svoboda, 1978). Comparison of the earliest Central European industries on the basis of a common descriptive method is an important aim for future research. The Earliest Industries In the early stages of technological evolution, procedures based on irregular trimming of rocks were most common (Fig. 4). The end products were heavily influenced by the type of raw material, so that heterogeneous rocks tended to produce irregular debris and flakes, and more homogeneous rocks produced regular flakes. Most of the earliest finds are of isolated artifacts or of small collections which are not suited for detailed characterization (Cerveny kopec, Suchdol, Karlich, Winningen, Koblenz-Bisholder). The larger assemblages from Pfezletice (a total of 335 pieces from Levels Al-4) and Becov I-B (204 pieces) have been described using the type list of M. D. Leakey (Fridrich, 1976a). Choppers are present in all the horizons considered and are made on large</page><page sequence="14">46 Svoboda pieces of debris, rather than on pebbles. The appearance of artifacts with bifacial retouch, classified as bifaces and protobifaces, is of some importance, but they cannot be compared with standardized Acheulean handaxes. Poly hedrons are rare and atypical. Various types of scraper-like retouch are frequent, but other types of tools (such as burins and borers) are very rare. Both industries have a rather crude appearance, primarily because of the raw materials used (phthanite at Pfezletice and quartzite at Becov). Fridrich observes that the artifacts at Pfezletice become coarser and heavier through time, especially during the supposedly more-forested phases of the interglacial maximum; however, the smaller tools never disappear completely (Fridrich in Sibrava et aL, 1979). The Small-Sized Industries The small-sized industries of Central Europe (Fig. 5) are associated with a temperate climate, deciduous and other forest elements, water sources, and, sometimes, travertine formations; small quartz artifacts are rarely found in deposits of colder periods (as at Ariendorf). The mean width of the artifacts in these industries is &lt; 3 cm and in the extremely small industries, such as those of Bilzingsleben and Vertesszolos, most of the artifacts are &lt; 2 cm wide. We now know that such extremely small artifacts were practical, especially for cutting meat; according to Isaac (1977, p. 44), a sharp or pointed piece need only be large enough to be held between the index finger and the thumb with the edge or point projecting. Wood and bone could have served as supplementary raw materials for larger tools and for other functions (Svoboda, 1982). There has been considerable discussion, however, about the meaning of this specialization in small tools: how far it is a result of adaptation (Svoboda, 1983) or of culturally induced limitations (the Early Taubachian; Valoch, 1977b). At Vertesszolos I and III (Kretzoi and Vertes, 1965), very small pebbles, mainly of quartz (with some limestone, jasper, and chert), were intentionally selected to be worked; these were smashed into debris and chips as was also done, for example, at Arago. Since the original pebbles were small, most of the artifacts retain some cortex on their dorsal surface; in a series of 500 pieces, Vertes found that the cortex had been completely removed from only 8.8%. On the other hand, some of the pieces made of jasper and chert are reminiscent of those from Bilzingsleben in both their size and their striking angles. At the time of discovery, the occurrence of small flakes at such an early site was surprising, and it was supposed that most of them must have resulted from the shaping of core tools. However, the number of true microchoppers and micro-chopping tools is lower than is usually indicated in the literature; the</page><page sequence="15">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 47 Fig. 5. Small-sized assemblage from Vertesszolos (Coll. Magyar Nemzeti Muzeum, Budapest). industry does have a heavy-duty component but the bigger tools are extremely rare. As noted by Kretzoi and Vertes (1965), there is no standardization in reduction sequences, but only in terms of dimensional seriation. The striking platforms of the flakes are never prepared but are seldom as wide as, for example, those at Biizingsleben (the jasper and flint flakes), and in many cases they are very indistinct (the quartz flakes). The rarity</page><page sequence="16">48 Svoboda of cores (or of irregular residuals with negative scars) is a logical conse quence of a technological process that was not based upon systematic core exploitation. One piece has been described as a prepared core with lateral crests, but a single specimen is not sufficient basis to establish the practice of core preparation. Overall, quartz was the most frequent raw material but it was not as frequently selected for further retouching as were the finer rocks. Apart from the rarity of heavy-duty tools at Vertesszolos, the typological structure (among the small tools) is comparable to that of Arago, Section 17 (Svoboda, 1978, 1987). Sidescrapers are the dominant class (&gt;50%) and are mostly straight or concave and often double and convergent. The second most important class is notches, including denticulates (usually convex) often forming Tayac points; there are also bees defined by two notches. Other tools include fine borers and both thick and flat endscrapers; some of the thick endscrapers resemble "Aurignacian" scrapers (as do also pieces from Arago and Mlazice). Microchoppers, micro-chopping tools and an exceptional "normal-sized" chopper complete the tool kit. There are several smaller assemblages (such as Karlich and Karlstejn) that seem to be similar in technology and raw material (usually quartz) to Vertesszolos, although different in age. They include small choppers and flakes with regular or irregular retouch. An extraordinary find in this context is the large uniface from Karlich made on a quartzite pebble (Bosinski, 1983). It resembles both the series of unifaces and partial bifaces in the Acheulean of southern France and a small artifact (a pebble core or possibly the remains of a core) from Vertesszolos. The industry from Bilzingsleben is the earliest to be clearly divisible into heavy-duty tools made on large cobbles of coarse-grained rocks, and light duty (small-sized) tools made on flint. The flint nodules were still roughly trimmed or smashed rather than exploited systematically, but the quality of the material meant that flakes were produced rather than debris. (If any other rock had been processed in the same way, it would probably have disintegrated into irregular small debris and chips.) The resulting flakes tend to have large striking angles, wide platforms with numerous shock marks from earlier unsuccessful blows and well-developed, sometimes multiple, bulbs. Their length/breadth ratio is extremely low (Weber, 1980). The negative scars on the striking platforms do not result from preparation but from the many changes of orientation during exploitation. That the edges of striking platforms are often retouched is a further indication of the irregularity and lack of planning in the manufactur ing process. The raw material was worked almost completely to exhaustion, so that there are no remaining cores, but only irregular residuals or fragments with negative scars, which also were sometimes retouched and used as tools.</page><page sequence="17">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 49 Although flakes are predominant, the debris was more often selected for retouching [70% of the retouched tools are made on debris, according to Burdukiewicz et al. (1979)]. Similar phenomena observed at Arago and Mlazice (Svoboda, 1978, 1980) suggest that flakes may have served their intended purposes adequately without retouching. Typological analysis of this very varied and rich assemblage is proceed ing using the analytical approach ["Merkmalanalyse" (Burdukiewicz et al., 1979)]. The first statistical analysis of an artifact sample has recently been presented by Mania (1986a, Table 2). Preliminarily, it appears that, among the small tools, there are numerous scraper-like retouched edges (convex, direct, concave, and converging to points), notched edges, and denticulated edges (sometimes forming Tayac points). Other types include endscrapers and micro-endscrapers, bees (including types defined by notches), and borers, some of them very fine; burins are extremely rare. These primary types occur associated together in numerous combinations. Some of the small pieces have flat bifacial retouch, but it is irregular and unstandardized. Among the heavy-duty tools, typical choppers and chopping tools are rare, and their edges are virtually rounded from repeated use. Most of the heavy-duty artifacts are large cobbles with traces of utilization, fragments of rocks, larger flakes, and anvils. There is some evidence for technological standardization in the pebble industries of sites on (or near) the river terraces of the Melnik Basin. The assemblages were made mainly of quartz and quartzite pebbles; the quartzite pebbles were usually worked into heavy choppers and chopping tools, while the quartz pebbles were used to produce small debris and flakes. Unlike earlier technologies, the pebbles were now systematically exploited from one face, beginning with the removal of primary (cortical) flakes and continuing with secondary (partially cortical) and then tertiary (noncortical) flakes. The residual cores are flat with a cortical back; examination of these residuals documents uni-, bi- and multidirectional techniques of exploitation. Study of the striking platforms of the flakes provides additional information: as would be expected, most of the platforms retain some cortex and faceted platforms are almost nonexistent. Prepared pebble cores are very rare, but there are some (one core with lateral crests and one with a rounded cortical back and prepared face). I have tried to compare the data from analysis of the flakes (cortical, partially cortical, and noncortical) in the pebble industry from Mlazice, located beyond the gravels of the Melnik Basin, with the analyses of pieces from the beach and the dune of the French Acheulean site of Terra Amata (Villa, 1983). The differences (a higher frequency of noncortical flakes in Mlazice) may be explained partly by the different methodological approaches, partly by the locations of the sites, and partly by a different (more regular)</page><page sequence="18">50 Svoboda technique of pebble exploitation. Mlazice most closely resembles the dune of Terra Amata (Svoboda, 1980, Table 5; Villa, 1983, Fig. 33); both of these industries come from situations where raw material was not readily available in quantity. The relative frequencies of platform types in the two industries are very similar (Villa, 1983, Table 27; Svoboda, 1980, diagram 3), but again, the Terra Amata dune data are closer to Mlazice than are the Terra Amata beach data. Villa explains the very specific character of the beach industry by the extreme local abundance of pebbles. By way of an analogy, we may compare it with the industries from some of the sites surrounding Mlazice that are located in river gravels (Svoboda, 1983). The Early Acheulean Problem The biased evidence at present available does not permit a detailed or complex characterization of the Acheulean of Central Europe before the antepenultimate glacial cycle (Fig. 6). One view of the Acheulean is that it consists of a single significant artifact, the handax, which may appear in a variety of contexts. However, the small-sized industries of Central Europe are technologically so distinctive in their absolute size and intensive edge retouch that even when a handax is found in such a context, as at Karlich (Bosinski, 1983), it does not make the industry Acheulean. Recently, an atypical hand Fig. 6. Early Acheulean. An alternately flaked handax from Bratislava (Coll. Filozoflcka fakulta UK, Bratislava).</page><page sequence="19">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 51 ax, with alternate bifacial flaking, was found with surface pebble industries relating to early terraces of the Danube at Bratislava (Fig. 6). It seems more acceptable that the Early (non-Levallois) Acheulean of Central Europe should be associated with pebble industries in those areas where pebbles are an accessible raw material. The alternative view of the Acheulean considers not the handaxes (which are usually missing) but the entire industrial assemblage. In theory, an Acheulean assemblage should not be small-sized and should not be Levallois. One such was collected by Fridrich (1976a) on the surface of a Mindel terrace at Becov II. The so-called "Clactonian" is another complex of industries which is dated to the Holstein interglacial in the middle Elbe-Saale region; this has more recently been considered as Early Acheulean (Mania, 1984). Weber (1980) metrically compared the "small-sized" materials from Bilzingsleben (square 122) with the "large-sized" (Clactonian) assemblage from Wallendorf, both made on the same raw material. The large-sized industries are characterized by more regular flakes with a higher length/width ratio and with usually unprepared platforms; however, the striking angles are extremely high, even more so than those of Bilzingsleben. Sidescrapers and points are present among the tools. The common features of the second group of industries are their large size and the standardization of techniques for manufacturing flakes. There is no established direct evolutionary continuity between them and the Evolved Acheulean. Cultural Standardization: The Evolved Acheulean The Evolved Acheulean of Central Europe (Fig. 7) seems to be a steppe and tundra phenomenon, associated with the interglacial and glacial climates of the antepenultimate and penultimate glaciations. Under these steppic conditions, stone and bone (rather than wood) became the most important raw materials, and technological standardization developed more rapidly. Core preparation was modeled on the preparation of bifaces and the Evolved Acheulean saw the appearance of several types of prepared cores. In the literature, the term "Levallois" is frequently applied to the Evolved Acheulean; however, the overall system of core preparation included a variety of techniques, only some of which would be regarded as classic Levallois. Although there is considerable similarity in the flat flaking applied both to bifaces and to pre-cores, the significance of this is not simple, since each involves a different mental template and approach. The bifacial tech nique is elaborate, and the final product is created slowly by many precisely positioned blows. It requires skill but not much intellect, and development of it leads to the mastery of biface manufacture apparent in later periods but not</page><page sequence="20">52 Svoboda Fig. 7. Evolved Acheulean from Markkleeberg (after Baumann and Mania, 1983). in other directions. The Levallois technique, on the other hand, requires more forethought: the manufacturing process is concerned primarily with core preparation determining the shape of the future artifact; a single blow is sufficient for the removal of the artifact itself. The technique, however, tends to lead to further evolution toward blade technologies.</page><page sequence="21">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 53 Evolved Acheulean technology is the earliest to involve specialized workshop assemblages at the primary sources of quartzite, such as Reutersruh and Becov, which document the entire process of lithic exploitation. The abundant material available at such sites has permitted the analysis of different techniques and the partial reconstruction of reduction sequences (Luttropp and Bosinski, 1971; Fridrich, 1982). The most important and commonest technique was based on flat core preparation. Other approaches are indicated by cores with horizontal preparation of the back, globular, and pyramidal cores, as well as unprepared single-platform cores and prismatic varieties. The flakes show a tendency to become narrower, as has been documented by Weber (1980) in a study of the length/width ratios. Thus, the specialized blade technologies evolved in the Evolved Acheulean; they reached their culmination in industries such as the late "Rissian" blade industry of Piekary lib in Poland (Morawski, 1975, personal communication). The flakes and blades produced by these standardized processes can be divided into three series: those with cortical dorsal faces, those with prepared dorsal faces, and those with deep negative flake scars on their dorsal faces. Preparation of the striking platforms appears in the Evolved Acheulean, including fine faceting; as would be expected, the finer flakes more frequently have prepared striking platforms. Weber's study (1980) also demonstrates that striking angles are smaller than in earlier assemblages. Again, raw material heavily influenced the specific character of Acheulean assemblages. The flint-based Acheulean extended from northern France onto the North European Plain (Hannover-Dohren, Lebenstedt, Markkleeberg, and Hundisburg), while Acheulean populations in the Central European Highlands, from eastern France through Germany into Bohemia, specialized in the use of fine-grained quartzite (Reutersruh, Weddersleben, Becov, and Stvolinky) (Fig. 3, 3). Typologically, the assemblages include bifaces and Levallois points (which are more finely made on flint), rare cleavers, numerous sidescrapers, notches, and denticulates, and some Upper Paleolithic types. Some of the assemblages still include tools made on quartz pebbles (Stvolinky). Recent excavations at Markkleeberg (Baumann and Mania, 1983) have enlarged and modified our understanding of two important aspects of the site: the site is now quite firmly dated to a warmer phase at the beginning of the Saalian cold period, and systemic collection of the artifacts now provides a representative picture of the true assemblage composition. Most of the assemblage consists of flakes (80%) and cores (17%), and only 3% are tools (including five finished bifaces); this is a typical structure for a workshop assemblage located at the raw material source (Fig. 7). The cores and unfinished bifaces include numerous misstruck and</page><page sequence="22">54 Svoboda abandoned pieces. The illustrated material indicates a high frequency of flat cores (some of them typically Levallois in form), numerous irregular cores, and some prismatic cores for the production of blades. The frequency of exhausted cores relative to that of precores and cores is high. Among the flakes, final flakes {Zielabschlage) and blades are rare (10-11%). As at other workshops, the relative frequencies have probably been affected by the selective removal of finished flakes and blades. The retouched tools are dominated by convex and straight scraper edges, sometimes converging to symmetrical points. According to Baumann and Mania (1983), the Markkleeberg industry should be regarded as an assemblage responding to very particular economic, technological, and ecological factors. It is the earliest, well-dated instance of an evolved prepared-core technology in Central Europe. Cultural Differentiation: The Early Mousterian The Evolved Acheulean was complex and variable and did not always include bifaces (for example, Rheindahlen B-5 and Horky I). Nevertheless, it is still possible to recognize other non-Acheulean industries, specifically the Early Mousterian. The Early Mousterian industries appear in various environments in the penultimate glaciation and in the preceding(?) warm period. They are represented by three distinct assemblages: the Rheindahlen type [after Rheindahlen B-3 (Bosinski, 1982)], the Becov type [after Becov I, location A-III-6 (Fridrich, 1982)], and the Ehringsdorf type [after the Lower Travertine (Behm-Blancke, I960)]. These assemblages lack bifaces and the Levallois technique was less common than in the Evolved Acheulean. The Rheindahlen type has been defined by the predominance of single and double sidescrapers, including Quina scrapers made on thick flakes, and by a series of characteristic points, including symmetrical and asymmetrical types with convex edges (Bosinski, 1982, p. 167). The Becov type is less distinctive (Fig. 8) but includes numerous sidescrapers and some Quinson points (Fridrich, 1982). The Ehringsdorf type is very characteristic; apart from typical sidescrapers and convergent points, it includes smaller leaf-shaped points and bifacially worked specimens (Behm-Blancke, 1960). Last Interglacial Adaptations: The Taubachian One of the noteworthy phenomena of the last interglacial, beginning at about 125,000-128,000 B.P. (Demek and Kukla, 1969), is the reappearance</page><page sequence="23">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 55 Fig. 8. Early Mousterian from Becov I, Location A-III-6 (after Fridrich, 1982). of a variety of small-sized industries, sometimes stratified above each other, that continue into the last glaciation (Fig. 9). Another important phenomenon is the concentration of living sites around warm, travertine forming springs (in the middle Elbe-Saale region, Slovakia, and Hungary) and, as shown by recent discoveries in the middle Rhine, in volcanic craters</page><page sequence="24">56 Svoboda 15 18 Fig. 9. Taubachian. (1-4) Kulna Cave, Level 11; (5) Ganovce, Level 4; (6, 7) Ganovce, Level 3; (8, 9) Ganovce, Level 2; (10, 11) Ganovce, Level 1; (12-19) Tata (Coll. Moravske muzeum, Brno; Narodni muzeum, Prague; Magyar Nemzeti Muzeum, Budapest). (Bosinski, 1986). Caves (Kulna 11 is one example) and open-air sites were less frequently occupied than either before or afterward. In the Carpathian Basin and the Rhine Valley, assemblages are com posed of small debris and flakes produced from quartz, quartzite, flint</page><page sequence="25">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 57 (chert), and jasper, usually not by standardized techniques. There are, how ever, obvious differences between the numerous small debris and chips produced on quartz and the larger, more regular flakes and retouched tools (including flat retouch and some bifacial pieces) made on flint or jasper. Some flakes, such as those from Tata, are reminiscent of Bilzingsleben and Vertesszolos in their small dimensions, extremely large striking angles and wide striking platforms; some scholars have, therefore, suggested direct cultural links between them (Valoch, 1977b). Other flakes, such as those from Taubach, have prepared platforms, are regular in shape and show the influence of the Levallois technique. Tata at first appears to be very like nearby Vertesszolos in using the same raw material and in artifact dimensions. However, at Tata some of the flake platforms are prepared, especially those on jasper. There are also regular flat cores, mostly exhausted, which were sometimes retouched and used as scrapers. The types of retouch are the same as those found at the other travertine sites, except for some Quina-like retouch and bifacial retouch. The sites in eastern Slovakia, such as Ganovce, have industries made by the direct striking of debris from the raw material or by the exploitation of unprepared cores. Straight or convex scraper-like retouch predominates among the tools, but there are also pointed types, extremely rare borers, and a massive endscraper (Banesz, 1970). In 1987, Kaminska reopened the excavations at the site of Ondrej-Horka and revealed a series of stratified assemblages; important new data may be expected from this excavation. Preliminary typological data from Kulna 11 (cf. Valoch, 1980) indicate the predominance of scraper-like retouch, including straight, convex, and concave forms and even bifacially worked sidescrapers. Notches and den ticulates are also present, as well as some Upper Paleolithic types (a burin). There are typical bees and micro-endscrapers defined by two notches, and quite fine borers. The various points include Tayac points. The coarse com ponent of the industry consists of only a few unstandardized artifacts, which would seem to be chunks of raw material rather than shaped tools. The assemblages from the middle Rhine volcanoes (Hummerich) include numerous scrapers, points (including bifacially worked quartz points), and very rare endscrapers and borers (Kroger, 1987). Levallois technology is quite widespread in some of the travertine sites of the middle Elbe-Saale region. The relative morphometry (the ratios of length, width, and thickness) of artifacts from Taubach is more like the Acheulean than the other industries considered here, while the assemblage from Weimar and, to some extent, that from Rabutz are closer to Wallendorf. Measurements of the striking angles show that they are relatively small at Taubach, increase in Weimar, but never reach the extreme values at Wallendorf (Schafer, 1981). The presence of some flakes and flat cores in the</page><page sequence="26">58 Svoboda Thuringian sites [Taubach and Rabutz (Behm-Blancke, I960)] indicates an acquaintance with the principles of Levallois technology; this is probably the most important qualitative difference from the earlier small-sized assemblages. However, in the absence of adequate samples of cores, it is difficult to compare these technologies in more detail. The question of Levallois persistence or continuity during the last interglacial is interregional. Other evidence that this technique was not completely abandoned is provided by the artifacts at the Lehringen kill site (Adam, 1951; Thieme and Veil, 1985). They are comparable to those from Polish sites such as Krakow-Zwierzyniec and Nietoperzowa cave (Chmielewski, 1975). Rheindahlen B-l (Westwand) is another important living site and work shop of the last interglacial (or beginning of the last glaciation), which cannot be included within the small-sized complex. Most of the artifacts could be reconstructed back to the original nodules (Thieme et aL, 1981). The method of exploitation seems to show several changes of orientation during flaking. The remaining cores are small and disk like or polyhedric in shape; they are probably exhausted. One Levallois blade core was found. Striking platforms are usually not prepared. As is usual at a workship, retouched tools are rare and cannot be refitted to the reconstructed nodules. BONE TOOLS The problem of distinguishing bone tools from bones modified or flaked for purposes other than tool-making is a delicate one. Polish and other traces of use wear are among the factors which must be considered in making the distinction. The oldest series of bone artifacts comes from Pfezletice, where, apart from a polished bone chisel, there are several knives, made on the long bones of large mammals, which have traces of use wear (Fridrich, in Sibrava et aL, 1979). The question of modified bones at Stranska skala remains unresolved, but there is an important collection of possible bone tools from Vertesszolos (Dobosi, 1983). Bilzingsleben has produced a large and varied collection of modified bones and antlers (Mania, 1979, 1986b), some of which have close analogies in the Upper Paleolithic of Dolni Vestonice. They can be divided into three groups: bone tools, usually made on the bones of large mammals and including heavy scrapers, push planes, knives, scaled pieces, flakes, and anvils; red-deer artifacts, particularly a series of possible hoes; and probable ivory artifacts. All of these categories show use wear in the form of polishes, striations, and scars. Modified pieces of antler, similar to those from</page><page sequence="27">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 59 Bilzingsleben, have also been found at Karlich and Ariendorf (Bosinski, 1983; Bosinski et al.y 1983a), The existence of a heavy-duty tool kit made of bone permitted the stone artifacts to become smaller. Most of the Acheulean sites lack the conditions for good bone preservation. A noteworthy exception is Lebenstedt (Tode et aL, 1953), which yielded pointed mammoth ribs, worked reindeer antler, and a small (6.5-cm-long) bone point. The pointed artifacts show that the Acheuleans had significant capabilities in the techniques of shaping and polishing bone. The small-sized industries of the last interglacial are also associated with modified antler and bone artifacts, similar to some of those from Bilzingsleben. There was a series of red-deer antler hoes at Taubach (Behm Blancke, 1960), and there are also a few scaled pieces, that were probably used as tools, among the many bone fragments from Kulna Cave, Layer 11, (Valoch, 1980). WOODEN TOOLS It is assumed that wooden tools were important in the industries of the forested environments of warm climatic phases, even though they are not found in excavations. Like bone tools, they could have replaced parts of the lithic inventories and. thus, influenced the composition of the preserved assemblages. It is even possible that the complete absence of stone artifacts from hominid sites such as Mauer and Steinheim could be explained by a preference for organic raw materials (cf. Soergel, 1922). This assumption is supported by the rare finds of preserved wood that do occur. It is found in the warm-period deposits of Bilzingsleben and Karlich (long, amorphous, wooden objects that are not demonstrably arti facts) and at Lehringen. The laste site yielded a spear, more than 2 m long, with a carefully sharpened, fire-hardened point. The site is interpreted as an elephant kill site (Adam, 1951; Thieme and Veil, 1985). SETTLEMENTS The location of early human settlements in Central Europe was deter mined by sources of water and by sources of lithic material. The role of natural shelters (caves and rockshelters) and of strategic hunting posts is difficult to evaluate since the landscape has sometimes been profoundly altered by geological processes. Most of the earliest sites are located on the shores of ancient lakes, by</page><page sequence="28">60 Svoboda springs, and by rivers, where the artifacts became directly incorporated into the fluviolimnic sediments. Such favored spots were often settled repeatedly, especially those near springs of mineral water (the travertine sites). It should be remembered, however, that reoccupation of a settlement may not always be recognized if the depositional rates were slower than those of travertines. The type of underlying stratum also affected the choice of settlement location; shoreline formations, lacustrine and fluviatile sediments, and travertines were all favored, while loess sites indicate the use of terrestrial deposits. The occupation of caves and rockshelters seems to have been rather unusual; Stranska skala(?), Hunas, Balve, Becov, Ciemna, and Kulna are exceptions. However, this situation may be due to the intensive erosion of the pre last interglacial cave deposits in most of the Central European karstic regions. Patterns of functional differentiation between sites are probably present in the very earliest times [the kill site(?) of Vertesszolos III] as well as later (the kill site at Lehringen). However, only in the Acheulean and later do we observe the first specialized workshops at the sources of raw material (Fig. 3, 3). It is difficult to identify and reconstruct the earliest dwelling structures. The earliest one was supposedly at Pfezletice (Fridrich, 1987). It lies inside the settlement area between the lake shore on the south and the side of a block of phthanite, several meters high, on the north. It was an oval structure on the surface of the ground, built of phthanite rocks and loam and measur ing 4 x 3 m outside and 3 x 1.5-2 m inside; the opening was toward the northwest. On the northern side near the entrance was a small (about 30 cm in diameter) hearth, not dug into the ground. The early excavations at Bilzingsleben were in fluviatile deposits, where all the smaller objects had been moved. However, as the excavations have approached the ancient shoreline, they have exposed cultural remains in primary position. In this area, Mania has discovered three features of larger bones and stones, two of them circular and one oval, which he interprets as dwellings; they are 3-4 m in diameter. Accumulations of charcoal near the supposed entrances may indicate hearths. There were also smaller bone working areas in the vicinity (Mania and Vlcek, 1987). There are patterns common to both Pfezletice and Bilzingsleben: all of the features open inland, rather than toward the shore, and the hearths are supposed to have been located at the entrances but outside the sheltered areas. The hearths may thus have been used for cooking and other activities outside the dwelling, and probably even protection of the entrance, but not for heating the inside. This is an important difference from some of the later structures, which date to colder periods. Fridrich (1976b) excavated a different type of dwelling at the base</page><page sequence="29">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 61 of section I A at Becov (Location A-III-6). This was a fairly regular oval depression, measuring 6.60 x 4.25 m and dug to a depth of 0.75 m into the subsoil. He supposes that it was originally sheltered by a quartzite rockshelter on the north, while the eastern and western flanks were protected by small, stone-built walls; the entrance may have opened toward the south. There was a fireplace in the center with a large pile of pieces of red ocher. At Ariendorf, Bosinski and others (1983a) have recently identified the semicircular outline of a possible feature, with a diameter of 2.7 m and containing large bones and some artifacts; they suggest that it was a hut constructed of bones. During the 1964-1965 excavations of Rheindahlen B-l [Westwand (Thieme et ah, 1981)], Bosinski found an oval pit, with diameters of 5.2 x 3.8 m, dug into the last interglacial Parabraunerde and filled with light-colored sediment from the overlying level. The entrance faced eastward and linked the pit to the scatter of cultural material in that direction. In the center of the pit, level with the supposed entrance, there was a raised area dividing the interior into separate depressions. Small areas of discoloration on the periphery of the pit could be traces of postholes. The distribution of burnt flint indicates that the fireplace was not inside the feature but near it. In the northern part of the excavated area, there was a circular accumulation of flint artifacts, where Thieme was able to refit the flakes back into the original nodules. In light of their horizontal distribution, he suggests that the concentration may indicate another structure, with a diameter of about 6 m. According to his interpretation, the two structures were not con temporaneous, but they both resulted from repeated stays of a group at the workshop. Finally, we should mention the fireplaces with artifacts accumulated around them, found in the last interglacial soil (Layer 6) of the loess sequence at Krakow-Zwierzyniec (Chmielewski, 1975, Figs. 16, 17). One of them was interpreted as an ovenlike structure by Chmielewski. EVIDENCE OF HUNTING Recent studies of natural accumulations of bones have resulted in con siderably more cautious interpretations of archaeological accumulations (Binford, 1981). However, current scepticism about the early living and hunting sites of Europe sometimes seems excessive. Villa (1983, p. 41) is probably overcautious in stating that "the evidence, as it stands now, does not provide solid proof of big-game hunting." The repeated association of traces of human activity with big-game remains is not accidental. Frozen</page><page sequence="30">62 Svoboda carcasses were certainly exploited when they were found (Gamble, 1987), but I do not believe that they would be systematically sought out as a substantial component in the diet. Elephant and rhinoceros seem to have been important prey of the early hunters. Their earliest appearance is at Pfezletice, together with horse and bison (Sibrava et al, 1979). At Vertesszolos, the animal bones (of horse, red deer, bison, and rhinoceros) were highly fragmented and the mode of their association with the cultural layers only makes it all the more probable that they really are the remains of early hunting (Kretzoi and Vertes, 1965). According to Dobosi (1983), the species distribution of the animals at the archaeological Sites I and III indicates a pattern of human selection, whereas the composition of the fauna at the paleontological Site II is closer to the natural proportions of herbivores and carnivores. The rich faunal assemblages from other archaeological sites of the temperate periods give a fairly standard picture. It may seem paradoxical that it was precisely the hunters of the biggest mammals?Proboscidea and Perissodactyla?who manufactured most of the small-sized industries. How ever, the effectivness of small (10 to 15-mm), sharp flakes for dismembering large carcasses is higher than would be thought (Isaac, 1977, pp. 44-46). At Bilzingsleben, especially in the shoreline zone, Mania (1983) observed a predominance of rhinoceros, red deer, beaver, bear, and elephant bones, including young and female animals; bovids, horses, pigs, and other animals were also present. Analysis of the bones demonstrates that only certain parts of the heaviest mammals (elephant, rhinoceros) were brought to the site. The bovids, horses, and red deer were butchered, but their entire carcasses were brought in. The presence of bears, represented mainly by skulls and paws, suggests that in this case the hunters were interested in skins rather than in meat. The abundance of red-deer bones in the redeposited fluviatile sediments of the site is a result of natural transport. The bones show consider able evidence of pounding and smashing, indicating both how they were exploited and their subsequent use as tools. The fauna at Mauer was similar in composition (elephant, rhinoceros, horse, bovids, and hippopotamus). The predominance of female animals among the elk led Soergel (1922) to suggest selection by human hunters. In contrast, there was no selection that could be attributed to humans observ able in the fauna of Steinheim. Another important assemblage of Middle Pleistocene fauna is currently being excavated in Miesenheim [horse, rhinoceros, bovids, red deer, roe deer, and bear (Boscheinen et al., 1984)]. The evidence from Karlich (Bosinski, 1983) indicates that the elephant was the most common prey at this site. Generally, however, the degree of hunting specialization in pre-Acheulean times was low. The evidence from Lebenstedt, the only Acheulean site with adequate</page><page sequence="31">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 63 bone preservation (Tode et aL, 1953), reveals a somewhat different picture. These hunters, who were perhaps the first to colonize the North European Plain, seem to have specialized in the hunting of reindeer (about 80 individuals, representing 63% of the fauna). This is very like the type of economy practiced in the same region in the Late Upper Paleolithic. The faunas from Ehringsdorf and Taubach are, again, similar in com position to the pre-Acheulean faunas (rhinoceros, elephant, and horse). Soergel (1922) compared the elephant and rhinoceros bones from the two sites and noted a difference in age at death between the sites, with pre dominantly young animals (especially among the rhinos) at Taubach and an underrepresentation of young animals at Ehringsdorf; there are several ways in which human activity could explain this difference (Behm-Blancke, 1960). The methods of bone and meat exploitation are documented by the traces of cutting (and possibly of burning) found on the bone fragments. The faunal compositions at Ganovce and Tata are quite similar; a pre dominance of young elephants was observed at Tata (Gabori-Csank, 1976). However, the rather fragmentary material from Kulna Cave, Layer 11, included large numbers of horses, accompanied by rhinoceros (Valoch, 1980). The kill site of Lehringen provides important evidence concerning early hunting activities (Adam, 1951). The association of the skeleton of an elephant with a wooden spear and a few stone artifacts is highly significant, although it does not demonstrate the killing technique used. There is nothing but ethnographic evidence supporting the improbable theory of driving elphants into pits, but the direct attack of a spear-carrying hunter against an elephant is also difficult to imagine. The hunters probably made use of the local landscape and drove the animal into a natural or artificial corral. SYMBOLIC AND AESTHETIC EXPRESSIONS There is little evidence concerning the earliest rituals and artistic or creative activities, although such activities must have played a vital role in early systems of cultural adaptation. Rituals are a response to an increased need for standardized social communication (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1979), infor mation exchange, mnemonic devices, emotional comfort, and other social functions. The application of art in the rituals of hunter-gatherers is usually complex, involving dance, music, theater, decoration, and so forth. There are only a few fragmentary documents of this sphere of creative activity from the Middle Pleistocene sites of Central Europe (Fig. 10), and these we should call symbolic and early aesthetic expressions rather than art.

Unfortunately, it remains possible that the short lines were engraved after the specimen had been excavated and while it was kept in the museum; this would accord with the continued lack of any other solid evidence for early human presence at Stranska skala. Recent discoveries by Mania at Bilzingsleben may cast some light on this early find (Behm-Blancke, 1983), since at Bilzingsleben, there can be no doubt about the authenticity of the recent finds of parallel lines engraved on</page><page sequence="33">Middle Pleistocene Adaptations in Central Europe 65 the bones of large mammals (Fig. 10,1). They show that the first nonutilitarian symbols of early humans were rhythmical rather than aesthetic. The Stranska skala find would indicate a similar conclusion, if it should be authentic. There is indirect evidence for creative activities in the numerous chunks of local ocher and quantities of powdered ocher found within the dwelling structure at Becov I, A-III-6 (Fridrich, 1976b; Marshack, 1981). One of the pieces of red ocher has striations and abrasion marks on both faces, and a flat rubbing stone, with a granular crystalline surface, had been abraded in the center during the preparation of ocher powder. Although we are hesitant to accept Fridrich's conclusions about anthropomorphic stone carvings at Becov I, the site is obviously important for tracing the origins of human decorative activities. Roughly contemporaneous^) with this is an isolated piece of red ocher from the Lower Travertines at Ehringsdorf (Behm Blancke, 1960). The best-known artifacts of this type are those of the last interglacial from Tata (Vertes, 1964): a "churinga" carved from a piece of elephant ivory and an amulet, supposedly inscribed with a cross, made on a polished nummulite fossil. Marshack (quoted by Schwarcz and Skoflek, 1982), who examined both the churinga and the nummulite, observed that one or both arms of the cross "engraved" on the nummulite are in fact natural fractures that penetrate through the stone. However, the ivory plaque appears to have been carefully separated from a compound molar tooth, shaped and beveled, and colored by rubbing with ocher: some symbolic significance is usually ascribed to this object. CONCLUSIONS The biological evolution documented in the Central European record reflects a gradual transition from Homo erectus to the earliest Homo sapiens. These populations created very different types of industries, ranging from very small-sized assemblages through nonspecific industries (includ ing pebble industries) to the Evolved Acheulean and related cultures. Human fossils have been found directly associated with various small-sized industries of the Middle Pleistocene warm periods (at Vertesszdlos and Bilzingsleben) and with the last interglacial Taubachian (at Ganovce and Taubach); there were no stone industries directly associated with the Mauer and Steinheim fossils. The makers of the Evolved Acheulean are known from occipital and parietal bones found at Lebenstedt (Hublin, 1984). Early Mousterian industries without handaxes are associated with human fossils at Ehringsdorf. The general trends of both the biological and the cultural evolution are progressive but not unilinear.</page><page sequence="34">66 Svoboda In Central Europe, where two glaciations advanced from both north and south, the impact of climatic changes was pronounced. Cultural evolution seems to have been less stable and less continuous than, for example, in the Mediterranean or even in Western Europe. The archaeological record shows an expansion of the small-sized industries during periods of temperate climate, when organic raw materials (particularly wood) were readily avail able. In contrast, the more standardized and technologically advanced industries, such as the Acheulean, appear during colder periods and in steppic environments, where stone- and bone-working were more important (Svoboda, 1982). The evolutionary process seems to have led to the formation of recogniz able cultural units, to which modern scholars can assign distinct names (such as Mousterian, or Taubachian). These units reflect stable behavioral systems that were limited in time and space. To understand how they worked, we have to evaluate, on the one hand, the various effects of environmental factors such as the type and form of lithic raw material, the extent of the forests, the availability of organic materials, environmentally induced isolation and contact between groups, and, on the other hand, the factors of communication, learning, and the establishment of traditions as an important pattern of human behavior. Urgent tasks facing scholars at the moment are the correlation of local stratigraphic systems and the creation of a general evolutionary model. Our ultimate aim is to explain biological and cultural evolution in terms of environmental pressures, migrations and adaptations, intergroup communication, and the stabilization of cultural traditions.
