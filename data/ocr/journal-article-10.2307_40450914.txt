Background Within recent years a number of stone objects have been found in the Central Highlands as well as elsewhere in the Territory of New Guinea and Papua. In most cases these have no apparent connection with the present-day material culture : the local people do not know their origin, but may use them for some purpose, such as magic. During our recent anthropological field work in the villages south of Kainantu in the eastern Highlands *, a small number of such stone objects came into our possession together with information relating to their con- temporary significance. Although they may be considered to be representative 1 Vide R. Berndt, A Cargo Movement in the Eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea.

Berndt in the area under discussion, they are not entirely so when the Central High- lands generally are considered. In the eastern Highlands they are comparatively rare, but become more plentiful in the Chimbu-Kerowagi-Nondugl-Ogelbeng- Mt. Hagen areas, and more sparse again in the Wabag (Wabaga) region. There are a number of published records relating to such archaeological specimens, and the more important references are contained in a bibliography prepared by Professor F. M. Keesing 2. One should, however, note particularly those of A. C. Haddon3, G. P. L. Miles4. A. Kasprusch S.V. D.5, G. Hölt- ker S.V.D.6, F. D. McCarthy7, P. England8, L. Adam9, E. Bramell10, J. J. Murphy n, J. Nilles S. V. D. 12, and G. Vicedom and H. Tischner 13. The objects may be roughly divided into the following classes14: a) mortars, bowls, basins of various sizes and shapes : some with a frieze of bosses, some with raised or moulded decorative carving on the outer rim and under bowl ; some with plain or fluted edging, with varying bases 15 : b) various pestles 2 F.

In this paper, however, we can consider only some varieties mentioned in these categories : for example, none of those included under (e) have yet made their appearance in the eastern Highlands. In fact the specimens illustrated here are far less elaborate and decorative than those found in the Chimbu-Mt. Hagen districts of the Wahgi Valley 20. Although such "stones" offer some interesting problems to the archaeologist and pre-historian, we are not concerned here with these : much of this must necessarily rest on supposition and speculation until intensive archaeological work has been specimens in the possession of the Rev. Bergmann of Ega (Chimbu) and the Rev. H. Strauss (Ogelbeng : Mt. Hagen), both Lutheran missionaries. Outstanding is a fluted edged bowl held by the latter, and an anthropomorphic design of an entwined snake, raised on the under surface of the bowl of a mortar owned by the former. 16 Vide C.

A mortar sculptured to the shape of a human head was, we are told, found by a Mr. McGregor of Baiyer River, but is now out of his possession. The Rev. Bergmann possessed a small fragment of stone showing an anthropomorphic figure roughly similar to that illustrated by England, ibid. - Within this category one should probably consider clay models noted by Nilles (Oceania, Vol. 14, 1943/44, No. 2, p. 115), and the roughly modelled bird used in sorcery, in clay or stone, owned by the Rev. Strauss of Ogelbeng. H. Murray, op. cit., p. 29 noted that human figures or heads in clay have been found on the Sepik River. 20 Murphy, ibid., p. 37. At Kambiliga on the south bank of the Middle Wahgi, on the way to Mt. Hagen, a mortar fragment was found. It had a handle attached and was evidently an oval-shaped vessel. The rim was carved like a thick rope. On the upper reaches of the Wahgi River was found a large white pillar of limestone standing upright (p. 38). - On the edge of the Kuku Kuku country, too (Murphy, ibid., pp. 38-39), fragments of mortars and pestles and the heads of a cockatoo and a cassowary have been found (now in the Australian Museum, Sydney). At the head of the Bitoi River circular bowls were found (ibid., p. 39), also on the Bulolo River and by the miners on the Watut River.</page><page sequence="4">55G Ronald M. Berndt carried out in various parts of New Guinea 21, and in addition until there is more available information on these "stones". In the first place, we know little or nothing about the origin of such "stones" 22, except that they are presumably pre-historic : by "pre-historic" we mean that they are not used by present-day natives for utilitarian purposes 23. In the Central Highlands, for example, the pestles are not used as pestles, nor the mortars as mortars, for the people do not use grain 24. But although we cannot ascribe such uses to them, the natives almost everywhere in the Highlands attribute to them some sort of functional significance 25. 21 The majority of these "stones" have been found on the ground surface or purchased from natives : only a few have been discovered in gold digging, clearing land etc. (vide H. Murray, op. cit., p. 28 ; England, ibid., p. 233) : in nearly all cases the stones were found lying in the bush away from the villages. Murphy (ibid., p. 37) mentions, "they have been dug up in creek beds or in gardens, and in many cases have been, for generations, in the possession of various native communities who use them in feasts and rituals". Schuster (ibid., p. 248) states that they are found on old village sites or in the forest ; Kasprusch (ibid.) writes that a mortar was found half buried in the ground, while others were found on top of a hill at a recently deserted village (vide Adam, 1946, ibid., pp. 252, 253, 254) ; Nilles (Oceania, Vol. 15, 1944/45, No. 1, p. 15) states he found some star-clubs and parts of mortars in native houses in the Wahgi and lower Chimbu, and fragments were also found in the earth in 1936, when ground was cleared at Mingende R. C. Mission Station. - Vide R. W. Williamson, The Mafulu, Mountain People of British New Guinea, London 1912, p. 75 ; and F. E.Williams, Natives of Lake Kutubu, Papua. Oceania Monograph, No. 6, pp. 30-31. - One specimen illustrated here (Plate 1, figure a) was dug up from volcanic soil in the vicinity of Ogelbeng (Mt. Hagen) ; another bowl or mortar (Plate 2, figure a) was found at Moiife, south 'of Kainantu (eastern Highlands) when excavating a hillside to make a road - it was approximatively six feet under the ground. - Vide P. Wirz, Einiges über Stein- verehrung und den Steinkult in Neu-Guinea. Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Basel, Vol. 57, 1946 ; C. C. F. M. Le Roux, De Bergpapoea's van Nieuw- Guinea en hun woongebied. Leiden, Vol. 2, 1948-51, p. 618. 22 There has, however, been some speculation, e. g., H. Murray, op. cit., pp. 29-31. 23 Although stone club heads are not used in the Central Highlands, they are in common use in the Menyamya district (adjacent to the Kainantu sub-district, on the south-east) by Kuku Kuku natives, who also make several varieties. (Vide Murphy, ibid., p. 39 ; G. Linsley, Patrol Report, Kainantu, 1951-52.) Ward H. Goodenough, Ethnological Reconnaissance in New Guinea. Bulletin University Museum, Philadelphia, Vol. 17, 1952, No. 1, p. 34, mentions that the Opiya of the Kuku Mountains use the stone-headed club : these stone heads take a variety of shapes ; discoidal and pineapple- shaped heads are common. - "The peoples of Biaru, the head of the Bubu River, the Ono head-waters, and the Waria head-waters also manufacture stone club heads, and a stone pounder" (Murphy, ibid., p. 39). The pounders are marked on one side with a conventional crisscross pattern, and are used for beating bark in the manufacture of « tapa cloth ». These were found and used in the districts south of Kainantu in the eastern Central Highlands for beating tapa cloth : they are said to be "penes of the sun", but are rarely made now : most are probably ancient stones : see Plate 2, figures e and /. - On the upper Waria (Murphy, ibid., p. 40) gongs of stone are used in ceremonial feasts. 24 Mortars may be used occasionally to grind other materials (e. g., W. W. Thorpe, Records of the Australian Museum, Vol. 17, 1930, pp. 348-55, plates lv-lviii ; F. E. Williams, op. cit., p. 30, fig. 5). 25 Professor F. Keesing mentions (Research Opportunities in New Guinea.</page><page sequence="5">Contemporary Significance of Pre-Historic Stone Objects 557 It is then their present-day use and significance which concerns us here, not their origin, technical and stylistic affinities, or antiquity. Unlike Dr. Adam, who considers that "the present natives having nothing to do with the extinct culture to which those ancient pieces belong, and their superstitions with regard to them . . . certainly do not deserve to be considered when the higher interest of scientific research is at stake" 26, we believe it to be entirely relevant, for native belief and speculation concerning such objects may offer us some clue to their original usages 27. They are, as we have indicated, used in a variety of ways, although viewed almost everywhere as relics of an ancient past. The uses to which they are put, and the way in which the natives themselves account for their origin, are discussed here in relation to one particular region, the eastern Highlands. Measurements and relevant particulars are noted briefly in an appendix (N° 13). 2. Uses and Significance in Other Regions Neuhauss 28 mentioned that a mortar and pestle were referred to as being a vulva and penis of the spirits ; Schuster, quoting Lewis, who found similar stone objects near Sattelberg on the Huon Gulf, gives native terms for them, and observes that although the present inhabitants know nothing of their origin or use, they regard them as the work of spirits, or as belonging to them, and having individual names 29. Kasprusch mentions that an anthropomorphic design on a large stone bowl from the middle Ramu River was said to be a marsalai spirit 30. England notes, in reference to a stone carving found on the middle Ramu River, that the native explanation is that such stones were brought there by the legendary Mar sarai (i. e., marsalai) spirits of the valley. They were regarded with "some veneration", and "it was not considered propitious to bring them into the village or fyouse-tambaran - the usual repository for articles of superstitious regard" 31. Williams mentions four stone mortars found in the neighbourhood of Kutubu : three of the four were used for specific purposes, for example, for pounding medicines used in the Usi ritual. It is clear, however, that they were not made for this purposes, but merely adapted to it 32. Le Roux mentions that stone mortars found north-west of the Wissel Lakes in mountainous country (Dutch New Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, Vol. 8, 1952, No. 2, p. 121) that "Among special problems which must await more detailed knowledge before they can be more than subjects for speculation are : the significance of a widespread distribution of supernat- urally-regarded stone mortars and pestles in the eastern half of New Guinea, seemingly 'functionless' in these non-grain economies " 26 L.

Berndt Guinea) were of fertility and magical significance 33. Williamson notes that the Mafulu had names for such stone mortars, and although they had "no knowledge of their origin or past use, the only explanation of the latter which was suggested being that they were used as looking-glasses by looking into the scummy surface of the water inside them" 34. Nilles notes that stone club heads and other objects may occasionally be used for magic 35, a sug- gestion noted by Vicedom and Tischner 36. In the Ega 37, Kundiawa, Min- gende 38, Kerowagi 39 (Chimbu district), Nondugl (Wahgi Valley), Ogelbeng40 and Mt. Hagen 41 as well as in the Wabag 42 regions, such stones have magical and religious significance, are associated with certain rituals (unrecorded) and possess a mythological background. Several specimens are here illustrated, for comparative purposes, from regions other than the eastern Highlands. The bowl in Plate 1, figure a, is from Ogelbeng43, and around the body of the bowl is shallow embossing ; Plate 1, figure g, illustrates a fragment of a large mortar, with an embossed frieze, from Kerowagi44; Plate 5, figures a, /, g and h, show several perforated discs of varying shapes from Kerowagi 45 ; Plate 4, figure e, a "pointer" star club head from Chimbu46. What was possibly the first specimen reported from the eastern Highlands, a large perforated disc (similar in type to a perforated flat club head), was' obtained in the southern districts below Kainantu by a patrol officer47 at 3:fafina, in the Fo:re country, within easy walking distance of 33 Le Roux, op. cit., p. 618. 34 Williamson, op. cit., p. 76. Compare this suggestion with the one given for the mortar discussed below and illustrated in Plate 1, figure d. - Dr. Ward H. Goodenough (ibid., pp. 10-11) mentions that a "number of stone mortars and pestles have been found by natives" (illustrated by him) on the Willaumez Peninsula (New Britain). "They disclaim any knowledge as to what they are and maintain that their ancestors neither made nor used them. Similar bowl-like mortars of stone are said by natives in the Witu Islands (adjacent to New Britain) to have been the mirrors of their ancestors, because they reveal one's reflection when they are filled with water. The Witu Islands contain large human heads cut in stone, which the natives also attribute to their ancestors." 35 Nilles, ibid., p. 15. 36 Vicedom and Tischner, op. cit. 37 Rev.

Cylindrical or conically shaped stones were placed along the roadways in Agarabe country 48. A rough stone (un worked), said to fall within this "prehistoric" category, was found by the Rev. Frerichs at Raipinka Lutheran Mission, near Kainantu, and wras used for garden magic. Near Tatagufa (Jate linguistic group), south-east of Mt. Michael in the Bena sub-district, a large stone figure of a female was said to be in the bush49. One mortar, illustrated here (Plate 1, figure Ä50), was found near Raipinka, but no particulars were given. A large stone mortar (of approximatively two feet in diameter), seen at Sonofi, south of Raipinka, was said to have been left by the spirits. There is thus sufficient evidence to suggest that functionally these stones are significant. With this background to our problem, then, we may proceed to discuss those specimens obtained personally by the writer. 3. Mortars and Bowls Under this classification are found a variety of shapes that may be called mortars, basins, bowls, vessels and so on. The stone bowl illustrated here (Plate 1, figure c) came from the district of Fugufinaga (Frufiraka), close to Hafaru (near Numbaru or Numparu), in the Jate-speaking region of the south-eastern Highlands. It belonged formerly to a man named 3:weizeifa, the father's father of 3:wi:seipana (from Hafaru) who (Feb. 4th. 1952, at Kogu) sold the stone to the present writer. No detailed story was associated with it, but it is said that during 3:weizeifa's life-time this bowl was a man (a spirit). This spirit-bowl spoke to Oiweizeifa, telling him that he would "turn into" the stone bowl (vide Appendix 1), and when he was thus "At Awfafina (Orfafina) a stone disc was seen. It was stated to have been found by women searching for food on the slopes of a wooded mountain between Awfafina and Awsena (Osena). It was claimed that no others had been found and that they did not know for what it had been used. When sighted it was hung on the branch of a tree in an Awfafina hamlet and was given to me immediately I showed interest in it. It was made of soft sand coloured stone but, externally, it is dark green, almost black with age. Roughly circular, it measures 7.75 inches in diameter. At the centre it is 1.25 inches thick and tapers off to blunt edges, now badly chipped. A hole 1.5 inches in diameter has been drilled through the centre. One side is smooth, apparently as a result of former polishing. The other side is rough and unpolished. It weighs 2 lbs. 3 ozs. and attached to a suitable handle would be a formidable weapon." 48 No. K5, 1947/48, ibid. : "In several areas stones, apparently of phallic signific- ance were seen. Most of these take the orthodox form of elongated pieces of rock or stone planted upright in the ground on roadsides - similar to those in the Taiora area and until recently in Aiyura village having been removed, allegedly, as a result of Mission influence. These stones vary from 18 inches to 2 feet 6 inches in height and 6 to 8 inches in diameter." Other stones were observed by the patrol officer and some relevant mythology detailed, but these are natural stones, unworked. 49 As this was not seen by the writer, it has not been discussed here, although it had mythological significance. 60 From Mr. R. Tews, Lutheran Mission, Raipinka.</page><page sequence="8">560 Ronald M. Berndt metamorphosed, D:weizeifa was to bury him in his garden in order to make the crops grow. When the spirit had changed into this bowl, 3:weizeifa placed it in his garden plot as he planted his yams (that is, he would perform the magic ; his wife or wives would plant the crop). The presence of this magic bowl produced a very large crop of yams (the text suggests that the yams themselves were phenomenally large). Thus he always had plenty to eat. When he died the bowl passed to his son (unnamed), and he too, with its aid, was able to obtain large crops of sugar cane, bananas and yams, as well as pigs. This bowl would hold converse with him. When he died the bowl passed to 3:wi:seipana, who used it in a similar way until it was sold. The latter part of the text (Appendix 1) stresses its function : it is used primarily to increase yam crops - and so great were the quantities thus produced that the yams were piled high in heaps and men and women called for the feast. The bowl is called a:viag€nufiai, "yam head". The second bowl, of unusual shape, illustrated in Plate 1, figure b, was purchased (Jan. 24th. 1952, at Kogu) from Lrantimu, of Numbaru in the Jate linguistic territory. The following story is told of its origin (Appendix 2). An old man of the Fo:re linguistic region, his district being unspecified, prepared for a trading expedition. He cut a length of bamboo and filled it with water 51, provided himself with yams, and picking up his bow and arrows, started on his journey. Another old man from the district of HiJ9go:fu, in Jate territory, with whom the Fo:re man had made arrangements to meet and trade, also set out, first collecting stone axe blades and shells. The Fo:re man reached a place called Ti:mo:gD:nitumpmo:gi:pi near Numbaru, where later wild bamboo was to grow : there he waited for his trading partner. Unfortunately, the HiJ9go:fu man lost one of his axe blades, and in searching for it delayed meeting the other. The latter waited and waited, but the HiJ9go:fu man did not turn up : so taking a bamboo arrow he shot it into a nearby pond, and from it grew clumps of bamboo. Then he returned home leaving his bow behind. In the meantime the HiJ9go:fu man was still searching for his axe, but being unable to find it he also returned home, without keeping his appointment. It is said that the bow left by the Fo:re man and the stone axe blade lost by the HiJ9go:fu man then combined and were metamorphosed into the stone bowl, remaining at Ti:mo:go:nitump- mo:gi:pi ; this accounts for its unusual shape. After an undefined interval it was discovered by the father's father of Lrantimu, named Aru'aru'pa. He brought it back to Numbaru and placed it in his garden where he had planted yams : as a result of this a very large crop was produced. When he died the stone passed into the possession of his son, Fumitoija, who was also able to produce large crops with its aid. When he died it passed to I:rantimu who used it for a similar purpose, as well as for the increase of pigs. Later he sold it to the writer. 51 This is the usual way in which water is carried : a length of bamboo is cut and filled with water, one end being plugged with grass.</page><page sequence="9">Plate 1 Ronald M.

Long ago, during the "sun time" (May to October : winter, the dry season) all the people of Grufe went into the bush to collect marsupials and small animals. In the camp was a pregnant woman (vide Appendix 3) who was instructed by her husband in the art of catching rats, by digging out their burrows : he told her to dig out the burrow which had no tracks leading to it, in preference to one where the tracks were newly made. Eventually she came to such a burrow and began to dig it out. Presently she uncovered a boss of the stone bowl, and looking at it thought it might be the leg of a pig. Uncovering it more, so that several other bosses were revealed, she thought they were legs of a dog. Uncovering more, she thought that it might be the remains of food left by pigs. Finally, she dug out the bowl and placed it on a pandanus mat. Returning to her digging she tried to find a rat, but on turning around saw a man sitting on her mat - the stone bowl had changed into a spirit. She was afraid, and looked at him in astonishment. The "stone bowl" man spoke to her : "What has happened to me ?" he asked. "Do not leave me here, but carry me back to your house." So the woman hoisted him upon her shoulders and carried him pick-a-back, his legs dangling down over her breasts. Returning to the village (Osimp^ka, in the Grufe district,) she placed him in her house : there he stopped for some time, the people being afraid of him, but afterwards he was re-metamorphosed into the bowl. For some considerable time the woman's house in which the bowl was lodged, cared for by herself and her husband, was regarded as "sacred". Eventually it passed to their descendants, whom the seller of the bowl called n£gin9go:mo:'ei. {Ntgin9go:mo:tei are those ancestors of the third ascending generation as well as all those generally classified as ancestors in the direct patri-lineage : vide R. Berndt, Kamano, Jate, Usurufa and Fo:re Kinship.) It was never moved by these nzgin9go:mo:tei&gt; but they looked after it 53. The village itself altered, new houses and fortifications were built, but the original house in which the bowl-man lived at Dsimpryjka remained, being from time to time reconditioned. When gardens were planted, this stone was invoked : "we talked to this stone ; we called its legs (bosses) ; then we went and planted vegetables, and always large crops were the result. The stone looked after our gardens. It looked after our pigs and made them increase." When the generations of n€gin9go:mo:tei died, it was passed on to those of the grandparents' generation, then to those of the fathers' generation and finally came into the hands of Mu:gi. Still it remained in the original woman's house, still it was invoked, until it was sold to the 52 This particular bowl was used in a cargo cult movement at Grufe : vide R. Berndt, Oceania, Vol. 23, 1952/53, No. 1, p. 59. 63 One version says that at times the bowl was buried in a garden to increase crops, but normally it was merely invoked. 36 Vol. 49</page><page sequence="15">562 Ronald M. Berndt present writer by Mu:gi. He was a lineal descendant of the pregnant woman who had initially found the bowl, but nowT an unbeliever in its magical efficacy, for he was an evangelist 54. It was stated that the "old people" (the ntgin9go:mo:tei) poured water into this bowl and used it as a looking-glass in order to decorate themselves for certain ceremonies 55. The bowl illustrated in Plate 1, figure e, has a frieze of bosses, each boss being indented, and was obtained (Feb. 13th. 1953, at Busarasa) from A'si:wa of 3:ra. It was dug up at Imajaguti, an a'numpa lineage ground at O:ra, by the local tultul (official), Na:mi, who called it kabo: or "drum" and used it for cooking food, or as a container for pig's grease. It too was possessed of magical powers. If it were buried in the ground and a pig killed over it, the ground being sprinkled with blood, this would ensure large litters of pigs. The bowl illustrated in Plate 1, figure /, is plain, although it is possible that a decorated fringe existed at one time. It was purchased (Dec. 22nd. 1952, at Kogu) from A:mi'jei, of Anumaga district, close to Jababi (Kamano), and was found nearby at Amu'rugaki by A:mi'jei's father's father, named Ju:ni:pa, who later gave it to his son Vsvsto:. Ju:ni:pa saw in a dream one night a small waterfall formed of rows of stone axe blades, and in the water was a bowl (known as the burn water stone). Next morning he went to the place he had identified in the dream, and found the bowl. He returned to his village with it, and while he slept the stone bowl came to him in the shape of a man, and spoke : "I am a man who looks after pigs. I am a man who plants yams and taro ; I am a man who kills others." Ju:ni:pa replied, "I am like that too. I do as you do. I kill men." Then he awoke and, taking up the stone, buried it in his garden : the result was a large crop. After this was harvested he returned the stone to his house. Later, he anointed it with grease and ashes and rubbed it over the bristles of a small pig he possessed ; the pig then grew to be very large. When Ju:ni:pa died his son looked after the stone and did the same with it, with similar results. Υενείο: placed it in the middle of his garden and planted crotons around it : and he had prolific crops. He collected special leaves and rubbed them on the stone, so that some of its power would be transmitted to them ; then he chewed them and expectorated the substance over pigs, to make them grow large. He always kept this bowl in a net bag : when he and his wives planted their crops they would rub leaves on it, chew them and expectorate them over the yams, sweet potatoes and so on. He then gave it to his son, who kept it in a net bag while it was not in use. The shallow bowl illustrated in Plate 2, figure a, was found approximatively six feet in the earth during the construction of a roadway between Moiife and Irafo districts (Usurufa). No story was associated with it, and soon after its discovery it was purchased (Dec. 22nd. 1952, at Kogu) from Kebo: of Moiife. 54 A certain amount of anger was expressed by the Grufe people generally when it was sold by Murgi. The writer offered to return it, but after much discussion it was finally decided that if an assurance were given that it would be kept safely within a special repository (i. e., a museum) the writer should retain it. 55 Vide Williamson, op. cit., p. 76 ; Goodenough, ibid., p. 11.</page><page sequence="16">Contemporary Significance of Pre-Historic Stone Objects 5f&gt;3 Near Tirokai (Tirokavi), not far from Grufe in Kamano territory, upon a mountain called Mo:go:naga, is a tree stump with an upturned stone bowl upon its apex. This rests on a pad of mo: fa leaves and fine grass, between the top of the stump and the bowl. It is used in the following way to perform magic on an enemy (Appendix 4). The hereditary owner of this stone (unnamed), resident in the district of Tirokai, but originally of Mo:gD;naga which was occupied by his patrilineage in a stockaded village, would collect jugujugw.fa fine grass and mo:fa leaves, and after scorching them in fire would place them under the upturned bowl resting on the tree stump. This would magically cause all the houses of his enemies to burn, the smoke from the kunai grass roofs entering the victims' eyes, nostrils and mouths and suffocating them. This stone did not come into the possession of the writer, because it was said to be too dangerous, although at one time it was promised. 4. Large Perforated Stones Under this heading are perforated stones that do not seem to have been club heads. The one illustrated in Plate 2, figure d, came from the district of Kogu, in the Usurufa linguistic territory (Jan. 9th. 1952), and was used in the following way. It was taken out during a hunting trip by two brothers who were its hereditary owners. The text (Appendix 5) relates how these two men, with the pregnant wife of one, set out carrying the stone and the usual hunting weapons (bow and arrows). The stone was placed at an aperture of a hollow tree, and the pair waited while marsupial after marsupial (of various species) passed through the perforated stone ; as one by one they passed through they were killed, until a large heap accumulated. The stone itself is said magically to have induced the marsupial to come out. When they had sufficient, they filled three bags, and returned to their village. On the following morning they went to the gardens and collected vegetables, sugar cane and bananas, and next day a large oven was prepared in which all, including the marsupials, were steamed. The vegetables and other food were placed on wooden dishes, the marsupials cut up and seasoned with wild ginger. Then the woman (the brothers are not mentioned) distributed the food, first to her own family (her sisters, brothers, her father and her mother), then to others of her husband's village (patri-lineage). The text ends with the statement that all this came about because of the stone. The origin of the stone was not precisely stated, but it was said to be itself a hollow tree with an aperture, in which great numbers of marsupials resided, and was found originally in the bush near Mairapa, in the Kogu district. Contradictory remarks, however, were made as to its real use. Some Usurufa and Jate men mentioned that it had been used to sharpen stone adzes, others that it was used to make rain and others again said it was placed in gardens in order to destroy crops. The other perforated stone of this group, illustrated in Plate 2, figure c, was obtained (Jan. 21st. 1952) from Numoigu* of Kogu and Ompo:si:dna</page><page sequence="17">564 Ronald M. Berndt from Numbaru, who acknowledged joint-ownership although they were genealogically unrelated to each other. This stone is associated with Keizo.zo:, and old marsalai spirit man. At first he stopped at I.zijafana, in the district of Numbaru : the stone, the i:zijafana, with its aperture was his doorway and home, and in this he sat (Appendix 6) with his old bow and arrows, watching for marsupials, rats and birds. These he was able to shoot easily, and after eating them placed their bones in an old net bag: eventually the bag became full. About this time he heard that the people at Kogu were holding a feast, having killed pigs (i. e., the seasonal Pig Festival). In anticipation he collected certain green leaves (usually eaten with pig meat) and brought them to Kogu, but the people gave him no meat. He looked at all of them eating, and in anger scattered his green leaves 56 : as he did so, fur, pigs' bristles, cassowary feathers, kunai grass, wild sugar cane and wild pandanus began to grow from the bodies of all the people. Leaving them, he ran towards Ha:ga:minaga, close to Kimiago:mu in Jate territory, where he turned into this stone now named Keizoizo: after him. The Keizoizo: stone remained at Ha:ga:minaga for a considerable time, resting on the ground with wild bamboo, wild sugar cane, ferns and various grasses growing through its hole. Around it grew many bara trees. The stone served as a guardian for all pigs and gardens, and caused their propagation and increase. If the hunter desired to kill many marsupials, like the old marsalai before him, he would go to this stone and break off a blade of grass or a piece of bamboo. 5. Pestles A perfect "mushroom" type 57 pestle, illustrated in Plate 3, figure d, was obtained (Feb. 25th. 1953) at Taramu, Jate territory, from an unidentified man : it had been used in garden magic. The second pestle of this "mushroom" group, illustrated in Plate 3, figure c, was obtained (Feb. 4th. 1952, at Kogu) from Mufa of Moiife. No story is given concerning its origin, but only its use. Mu'a's father Amaiju obtained the stone from Tatagufa, in Jate territory. The stone charm is called ati:jafani ("bow stone"), and when Amaiju went out fighting he suspended it from the cassowary plume which decorated the apex of his shield. With its aid his bow achieved sureness of aim, and he (with his fellow Moiife warriors) was able to lay waste the villages of Anoinana (Usurufa linguistic unit), Kogu (Usurufa), and Fo:mu (Kamano), driving away the 56 The leaves had been put by this marsalai in his old bag containing the bones of the many different animals and birds he had eaten : when he scattered his leaves among the people he also scattered the bones, and as a bone touched a man or woman so from his or her body would immediately grow the fur, bristles or feathers originally possessed by the animal or bird to which the bone belonged : in addition, he had in his net bag various grasses which were also thrown out. 57 Vide for comparison W. H. Goodenough (ibid., p. 11, fig. 2), who illustrates two pestles (left of plate) which belong to our "mushroom" classification.</page><page sequence="18">Contemporary Significance of Pre-Historic Stone Objects 565 people and burning all their houses. Since the cessation of hostilities in this part of the country, the stone hung in his house until it was brought and sold to the writer (Appendix 7). The "mushroom" type pestle illustrated in Plate 3, figure e, was obtained (Jan. 6th. 1953, at Kogu) from Ou:sa of Anumaga (Kamano). It came originally from Tirafei district (Kamano), where U:wania found it while digging a garden plot at Po:pry)ka. U.wania rubbed with it the sweet potatoes which he gave his pigs, so that the pigs grew large. He sprinkled ashes over the bodies of his pigs and then rubbed these in with the stone : this ensured large litters. When a pig was to be killed for a feast, the stone was first put in a hole, then covered up. The pig was slaughtered immediately above it so that blood ran over the place where it was buried - this increased the number of pigs. Or it was placed on top of a pig which had been killed, 'so that there would always be plenty of pig meat'. Uiwania also planted the stone in the centre of his garden plots, to ensure good crops ; he put it at the base of his banana plants, and the bunches they grew were large. When U:wania died it passed to his son, Waijuimi, and on his death to his wife, Anavesu, who handed it on to Ou:sa, her son by a different man. The "mushroom" type pestle illustrated in Plate 3, figure /, was obtained (Feb. 10th. 1953, at Busarasa) from A'siiwa, who dug it up in a garden at Pi:nda:go:risa (3:ra). It was used to increase taro and yam crops, and at times during fights to ensure accurate aim in shooting, being tied to the end of a net bag full of arrows. Its hand-grip was broken off by A'si:wa's child, and lost. The object illustrated in Plate 3, figure b, is a modified "sceptre"-like pestle top, its base (said to have resembled the "mushroom" type) having been broken off and lost. It was obtained (Feb. 13th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Tabi:jei (of Busarasa, Fo:re linguistic territory), who used it as a necklet charm to deflect arrows : when an arrow was shot at him, it would hit the stone and break. It was called kambija:mpuf which is an alien word belonging to the Ta'vo:' people (south of Busarasa, towards the New Guinea- Papuan border), from whom Tabi:jei allegedly bought it. The roughly worked supposed "pestle", illustrated in Plate 2, figure h, was obtained (Jan. 19th. 1952, at Kogu) from Aijopina, a Moiife man of the Usurufa linguistic group. The following story (of which several versions are extant) accounts for its origin (Appendix 8). During the "sun time" all the people from the Moiife district went out into the bush to hunt. One pregnant woman wandered off by herself. At Terinoteiga, close to Kogu, a female marsalai had placed an egg, but Being frightened at the approach of the pregnant woman she ran away. When the woman reached Terinoteiga she saw the egg lying on the ground. "What is this ?" she asked herself. "It may be a cassowary egg." Picking it up, she placed it to her mouth δ8 and swallowed it - it went down into her belly ; 58 In the text the word anakaigznu "round it", is used - meaning she placed it in her mouth, her lips encircling it. She possibly had no intention of swallowing it, but it slipped accidently down her throat.</page><page sequence="19">566 Ronald M. Berndt she then returned to her village. A little later the female mar salai came looking for her egg, her child, who was named Paktrio ; unable to find it, she began calling it by name. The egg answered from the belly of the pregnant woman, who asked herself in fear, "What is that ?" She ran into her house. Again the mar salai called, and this time the egg replied, "I stop here in belly." The pregnant woman was by now terrified, and fastened her door securely. Again the marsalai called, and her egg-child guided her to the house - "I stop here in belly" it replied. Coming to the house (all the other people being absent hunting) the marsalai burst open the door and attacked the woman, eventually slitting open her belly and removing the egg. She took it to Zifomaga (or Eifo:naga), near Mairapa in the Kogu district, where she placed it on the ground : it then turned into stone (the "pestle" which is called Pakzrio). Some considerable time afterwards Numa'u, a Moiife man, collected mo:fa leaves, ugimgufa grass, and kanokanomo: fern, and wrapped the stone in these. On a fighting expedition he carried it into the Fo:re territory. When attacking the Atiia people (south of Fo:re) he removed a little of the stone's wrapping and, rubbing it against the stone, placed it in a fire-brand which he used to burn many houses. Then he carried it against the 0:wa:bi (Jate) people, and using it in the same way burnt down many houses. Again, he fought against the Fo:mu (Kamano) people (half a day's walking distance from Moiife) and used some of its surrounding leaves in burning many houses. When Numa'u died it passed to his son Maru:ri (who used it for a similar purpose) ; when he died it went to his son, To:b:wa, now an old man at Moiife. It was sold by To:b:wa's son, Aijopina. The cone "pestle", illustrated in Plate 3, figure a, was obtained (March 25th. 1952) from Kabi:uzi:nu at the Kamano village of Kek^r^:'naηka (called No. 1 Sonofi), in the district of Sonofi. The stone is called kampa:wa and was originally from Oijasaka, in the bush near Sonofi. It was obtained by the seller's father, Vssazu, but no story was known to be associated with it. When yams or other crops were planted, this stone (said to be a penis) was placed in the garden and crotons planted around it ; by doing this large crops were ensured. 6. Unidentified Stones Of this type, the first is what appears to be a stone "pounder" or "anvil" (illustrated in Plate 2, figure b 59). It was obtained (Jan. 23rd. 1952, at Kogu) from a Numbaru man named Jaia'mu, whose father Gum'mari discovered it at 3:gulmalgati, near Numbaru. In the text, however (Ap- pendix 9), it is said that Ja:a'mu's third ascending kinsfolk (n€gin9go:mo:&lt;ei ; 59 Stones of this shape are more common in the Chimbu district : several were in the possession of the Rev. Bergmann of Ega, who gave one to Professor A. P. Elkin of the Department of Anthropology, University of Sydney. A large and ancient one, much too heavy for one man to carry, was seen by the writer lying on the roadway near Kundiawa Patrol Post (Chimbu) where stones had been collected for repairing a bridge. These stones are probably not worked, but water- or weatherworn.</page><page sequence="20">Contemporary Signiiicance of Pre-Historic Stone Objects 567 implying also a remote ancestor) possessed this stone, and that when he planted yams he placed it also in the garden : its presence ensured a prolific crop. It then passed to Gum'mari who did likewise, and when he died to his son Ja:a'mu who sold it. No story relating to its origin is available. Two so-called "pounders", identical with that illustrated in Plate 2, figure b, were shown to the writer (Dec. 24th. 1952, at Kogu). The first was brought by Kateijabu of Mairapa village, Kogu, and had belonged to his mother's father, named Hi:^va, from the Jate district of Keijagana (Ke'jagana) To:eja:f9rslga village, o:rni:'sa:gu lineage. It was originally found at Keijaga, near Taramu (Jate), and was used in garden magic, being placed in a hole in the middle of a plot. During fighting, bark from the ati:josa ("bow wood") tree was expectorated on the top of it, then collected and eaten with food ; men who did this would be strong to go out and kill their enemies. The second stone, the avi'jafa (yam stone), was also shown by Kateijabu. Originally Gaufi, an old man at Keijagana, found this stone at Ko:tuteiga (Keijagana) in a round pool. He used it to make his gardens grow. He would place it in the centre of a plot and pile food around it, expectorate ati:josa bark upon it, and then set to work planting the crop. When a pig was to be killed he would place it nearby, and when a pig was to be cooked in an oven it was used as one of the oven stones ; hence there were always plenty of pigs. The stone passed on his death to his son, Avibanai' at Kotuteiga (Jate), then to the latter's younger brother, U:eiva at Keijagana, then to U:eiva's younger brother, Wareibi, then to Avibanai's son, Jababari:a. Finally it passed to Jababari:a's "half" brother, Kateijabu. An "iron" stone of heavy metal called o:nxiy is illustrated in Plate 2, figure g, and was dug up in a garden plot at I:so:go:ri (3:ra) by A'si:wa of 3:ra, from whom it was obtained (Feb. 10th. 1953, at Busarasa). It was used in garden magic, being buried in the centre of a plot. It does not appear to be archaeological in the sense of ever having been worked by the hand of man. The small "screw" stone illustrated in Plate 3, figure b, is unworked, but has a binding of orchid cane at one end which appears to be blended with the stone itself. It was obtained (Feb. 13th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Tabi:jei of Busarasa (Fo:re), and was used by him as a necklet charm to deflect arrows (similarly to the pestle top, illustrated in the same figure). It was originally found by him at Eigu:jeiganti, Mo.ge district, adjacent to Busarasa. 7. Club Heads In this region club heads are occasionally found ; but they are not so plentiful as in the Central Highlands around Chimbu and Mt. Hagen, although the eastern area is closer to the "semi-nomadic" Kuku Kuku who, apparently, still manufacture a variety of stone club heads. The plain stone club head, illustrated in Plate 4, figure a, was obtained (Jan. 19th. 1952, at Kogu) from Gazi:o, a Jate man living at Moiife, and the following story is told of its original use (Appendix 10). An old man, a marsalai spirit, lived in a large stone cave which he</page><page sequence="21">568 Ronald M. Bern dt had made himself. One day a small boy went out to shoot birds, and finding a tree with flowers upon which birds were feeding he shot his arrow, killing one. The arrow, with the bird, fell some little distance away at the feet of the old man, who picked it up, cooked it and ate it, and placed the arrow on the ground nearby. Eventually the boy reached the old man's place, looking for his arrow : "Have you, or have you not, seen my arrow?" he asked. The old man replied, "I have eaten the bird, but the arrow I have placed there", and he gave it back to the boy. To recompense the boy he collected food from his garden, and after cooking it, both ate. By this time night was approaching, and the old man took up the stone club head and pointed it towards the large stone which was his house. As he "marked" its entrance, the stone opened like a door revealing its inside. Both entered, the door closing behind them, and went to sleep. In what he gauged to be early morning the boy awakened, and becoming anxious called to the old man, who took no notice of him. In desperation, and hoping to gain possession of the magic stone in order to escape, he killed the old man. He then tried to find his way out : "What way will I go ?" he asked. Again and again he felt around the cave, searching for the magic stone, trying to find a way through the stone walls - but there was no opening, and he could not find the magic stone in the darkness. In hunger the boy cut up the dead man's body, and ate until it was finished 60 : then he chewed and ate the net bag, as well as his waist-band and skirt. Finally, he slowly died of starvation ; but when he died the door of the cave opened. In the meantime, the boy's younger brother was searching for him. At last he came to the cave and saw what had happened. He entered it and collected his brother's bones, the magic club head, as well as the bones of the old man. All these he brought back to his village where a mortuary feast was held. Later he took the stone to Aifo:piti, in the bush near Kogu, where he left it. From here, the stone served as a guardian of pigs, always providing adequate food for them. Later, the nzgindgo:mo:tei ancestors of the seller of the stone found it and brought it to Moiife, where it was placed near the villages so that it could watch over the food supply of their pigs. When the nzgin9go:mo:{ lei died the stone passed to Jota'irno, then to his son Ja:bi:o, and finally to his son Gazi.o who sold the stone to the writer. The knobbed stone club head, illustrated in Plate 4, figure b, was obtained (March 19th. 1952) from Mo:nutu*eivi, from Inivijo:wo:weipa (Jate), at Taramu. No story is associated with it, and only its use in garden magic is noted (Appendix 11). It was originally possessed by the seller's nzgindgo:mo:ei who placed it in his taro gardens to ensure large crops. Later, it passed to his father, named Mo:nutu, who used it in a similar way. When he died it came to Mo:nutu'eivi, who placed it in his garden, planting taro and yams, and was thus able to obtain very large crops. Finally, it was brought to the writer and sold. 60 Cannibalism is an established feature of this area.</page><page sequence="22">Contemporary Significance of Pre- Historic Stone Objects 569 The knobbed club head illustrated in Plate 4, figure d, was obtained (Feb. 5th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Sari of the anumpa lineage, D.ra, whose father, Nasumbi, found it in a garden plot at I:so:go:ri (D:ra). It was used in garden magic. The object illustrated in Plate 4, figure g, is part of an unpierced double-knobbed club head, obtained (Feb. 16th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Ki:ma:ni, luluai of Ja'argusa district (Fo:re), and was found there in a garden called Waii:ti. It was used as a charm to direct the aim of an arrow, as in the case of the "star" club head mentioned below {vide Plate 4, figure /), the stone being placed on the ground and the bow end inserted in the unpierced cavity, then held in position with the toes while the bow string was drawn. The "four point" star club head illustrated in Plate 4, figure /, was obtained (Feb. 4th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Tabirjei of Busarasa, a Fo:re speaking district. Possessed originally by his father, who found it at Kabumanti (a Busarasa district), it was used to direct the aim of an arrow, being place on the ground with the point of a bow resting in the central hole. The "eight-point" star club head illustrated in Plate 4, figure c, came from Neseija of Keijagana (Jate), visiting Taramu (March 20th. 1952). Again there is no story associated with it (Appendix 12). Originally, it was owned by an ancestor {n£ginggo:mo:'ei) of the seller, who tied it to the top of his bow when fighting : it was held so that one point (it was originally a large "eight point" star club head, now having all its points except two broken off) pointed in the direction of an enemy. This magically aided the aim of the bow-man, who was able to shoot many people. When he died it eventually passed to the father of the seller, Ni:ni:mu, also of Keijagana ; then it went to his elder brother, Maganaifa, who led successful fighting expeditions against the Taramu and Kei9fu (Jate) people. When he died it passed to Neseija, who used it in a similar way, with its aid shooting many people. As inter-district fighting was being abandoned he sold it to the writer. The club head illustrated in Plate 4, figure h, is of the variety commonly known as "pineapple", and was obtained (Feb. 4th. 1953, at Busarasa) from A'si:wa of the Foire speaking district of 3:ra. A'si:wa found it in a garden plot at I:so:go:ri (3:ra), and brought it home. Then he slept, and in a dream this stone "turned" into an old man, the spirit of the club head, who spoke to him : "I understand how to look after gardens and pigs, I can make big crops come up : these I can eat too (i. e., their spiritual substance). You have dug me up. Look well upon my body and carry me to your house : there I can stop with you, and you will have plenty of pigs." And A'si:wa kept it for a long time, naming it I:so:go:ri (which means a large tree). A large round thin-edged perforated disc (club head) illustrated in Plate 5, figure d, was brought up at Kogu by an unidentified man from Numbaru (Jate) ; it was used in garden magic. The round perforated stone disc or club head illustrated in Plate 5, figure b, with string attached, was obtained (Feb. 19th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Nantakabara, of the kasaru lineage, 3:ra district, who found it while digging a road at Kantawati p:ra).</page><page sequence="23">570 Ronald M. Berndt A round perforated stone disc or club head with flattened edge illustrated in Plate 5, figure c, and obtained (Feb. 5th. 1953, at Busarasa) from A'boija, the "mouth" or "boss boy" of the a!numpa lineage at 3:ra, was found by his wife, Natsrira, in a garden at £ri:teijanti (anumpa, 3:ra). It was used to increase both crops and pigs. The small round weatherworn perforated stone club disc illustrated in Plate 5, figure e, was obtained (Feb. 12th. 1953, at Busarasa) from Dnteigu of 3:ra, who found it in a garden at Abo:ro:nti (3:ra). It was used in garden magic. 8. Conclusions From these examples, we may observe that the eastern Highlanders themselves have no knowledge of the real use or actual origin of these pre- historic stone relics. For example, there was no hint that the stone club heads were in reality club heads - no awareness that they could be used for that purpose 61, nor knowledge of people who did use them. This is surprising, since one would have expected some knowledge of the so-called Kuku Kuku, who employ such weapons, to filter into this region. The fact that they do not know confirms other evidence relating to their ethnocentrism and their relative isolation re-inforced by habitual inter-district fighting. As regards the stone bowls (mortars or receptacles), although wooden bowls of varying shape and size are common utensils in this region 62 there are only two references to their possible use in this way - that is, that they could be filled with water and used as a looking-glass (Plate 1, d), or employed as a cooking utensil or grease bowl (Plate 1, e). The former remark, however, was made only after its magical function had been mentioned, and when informants were asked whether they knew of any other use it might have had : the latter remarks were made voluntarily. Again, in the case of the perforated stone (Plate 2, d), it was after its relevant history and magical use had been detailed that some men suggested it had been used at one time for sharpening adze blades. That any should have been used as mortars, as pestles, or as club heads was not suggested. Nor is there any direct evidence to suggest that bowls, mortars or perforated stones symbolize the female genitália and the pestle the male, as has been mentioned by Neuhauss 63, 61 Knobbed wooden clubs were used, but were not common, in certain Jate and Usurufa districts. It seems unusual that the Fo.re people had no idea of the use of stone club heads for they lived in relatively close proximity to the Kuku Kuku people who made and used them. Vide Footnote 23. 62 None of these wooden bowls really resembles the stone bowls, mortars, etc., in shape or design. The nearest comparisons can be made between that illustrated in Plate 2, a and the ordinary flat wooden dish in common use ; or between those illustrated in Plate 1, a and c, and the wooden grease bowls. The half coconut shells, traded into the inland from coastal areas and used for grease containers, resemble the stone bowl illustrated in Plate 1, /. 63 Neuhauss, op. cit.</page><page sequence="24">Contemporary Significance of Pre- Historic Stone Objects 571 except in the case of the "pestle" illustrated in Plate 3, a. But the bark cloth "beaters" (Plate 2, e and /) were invariably spoken of as penes 64. There is a lack of uniformity as far as their mythological background is concerned. Some are accounted for by long stories, others have no such background and were just found : for example, two mortars (Plate 1, e ; Plate 2, a) ; one large perforated stone (Plate 2, d) ; six pestles (Plate 3, a, b, c, d, e and /) ; three unidentified stones (Plate 2, b and g ; Plate 3, b) ; and eight club heads (Plate 4, b, d, f and g ; Plate 5, bf cy d and e). Some are metamorphosed spirits - for example, four mortars (Plate 1, b, c, d and /), one large perforated stone (Plate 2, c), one "pestle" (Plate 2, h), while one mortar was formed by the union of a stone axe and a bow (Plate 1, b) ; a perforated, stone was the hole of a tree through which marsupials passed (Plate 2, d) ; and one club head (Plate 4, a) was used by a spirit being, and another (Plate 4, h) "turned" into an old man. It is apparent that these myths have grown up to account for their origin, so that to-day there is no questioning on the count that they may have been made at one time by some remote ancestors or some pre-historic people for specific purposes. Like the veracity of the tale itself, the objects are taken for granted. That the shape of an object should have determined its mythological association is seen in the case of one mortar, having a frieze of bosses that are likened to "feet", or the "pestle" shaped like an elongated, centrally compressed, egg ; the large perforated stone signifying the aperture of a hollow tree ; the keizo:zo: stone, first the doorway and home of an old marsalai, and later the spirit himself ; while the club head used magically to open a doorway in solid rock would suggest the rock home of the spirit as well as the doorway. With such relationship between object and tale, a certain ingenuity of inven- tiveness, a logical determination, is revealed. This is an aspect which could, with no doubt rewarding results, be carried further in a broader study of mythology, in relation, for example, to topography and natural phenomena. The shape of an object has not, however, except in perhaps four cases (the large perforated tree stone, Plate 2, d ; the penis "pestle", Plate 3, a ; and the "pointer" club head, Plate 4, c and /) determined its present-day function in magic. (Except that for purposes of fertility they may suggest to the performer that they are possessed of such qualities by reason of the sex they appear to indicate - vide Footnote 64). There is usually no direct relation- ship between the tale accounting for its origin and its contemporary use. In the majority of cases these pre-historic relics were "found" some considerable time ago (except those illustrated in Plate 1, e ; Plate 2, a ; Plate 3, / ; Plate 4, g and h ; Plate 5, b, c and e, and the two non-archaeological specimens, Plate 2, g and Plate 3, b) either by a paternal grandparent of the last possessor, or by his n€gin9go:mo:tei, who may be a person of the e* During our second period of field work in the Busarasa Fo:re district (1952-53), in discussion, natives suggested that such objects as bowls and perforated stones or pestles (particularly the "mushroom" type) were used in garden magic or to increase pigs because they resembled female and male genital organs.</page><page sequence="25">572 Ronald M. Biírndt third ascending generation or simply a remote ancestor. When found they were used magically for a definite purpose, and handed down from father to son, through the patri-lineage, or from mother to child, each possessor using them in a similar way. All these relics (except the bowl recently found, Plate 2, a and the round perforated stone disc, Plate 5, δ), have a specific function in contemporary life ; all are used magically. The majority relate to fertility of garden crops and to the protection or increase of pigs - mortars, a large perforated stone, pestles, "pounders", and club heads. In this area, where the people are dependent on their gardens and on their pigs, there is, surprisingly enough, a paucity of garden and animal magic. Seasonal harvesting and pig festivals were, and are, held, and have an indirect fertility significance, as have cannibalism 65 and the burying of human bones in gardens for the increase of crops and pigs ; but apart from these there seem to be virtually no spells, chants and rites. Such stones used in garden and pig fertility either are buried in the garden itself or radiate their magical power from a distance. In the former case the crop (yam, taro and so on) is planted, and somewhere in the garden the magic stone itself is buried. This is consistent with the practice of burying in a garden human bones or any natural stone which may resemble in shape some particular root vegetable. In some cases the stone object was left at a special site, and through the "power" it radiated ensured prolific crops and ample indigenous food for pigs, and caused pigs to increase. In this category a mortar was invoked to release its power ; with two others was associated a form of hunting magic, whereby (in one case) the owner of the stone removed from its aperture a blade of grass, or a leaf of bamboo. Eight stone objects were used as magical aids or charms in fighting. One, a mortar (not illustrated in this article), after the performance of a rite caused the houses of the performer's enemies to burn and the victims to be suffocated. Another, a pestle which was the "egg" Pakerio, was also carried about on fighting expeditions, and fragments of its grass wrapping were used in fire-brands to burn down houses of enemies. Two "mushroom" pestle charms, a pestle top, a star pointer and double knobbed club head, and a small stone, enabled their possessor to have sureness of aim with bow and arrow when fighting or caused arrows aimed at him to be deflected. Only one relic, a perforated stone, had a contradictory purpose. On the one hand it was said to be used in hunting marsupials ; on the other, it could be used to destroy crops if buried in a garden. It was also said to have been used magically to cause rain, and for the mundane purpose of sharpening adze blades. 65 The cutting up of a corpse, its preparation and cooking, as well as the subsequent feast, usually (but not always) took place in the gardens.</page><page sequence="26">Contemporary Significance of Pre-Historic Stone Objects 573 The following table demonstrates the variety and function of the twenty- eight specimens from the eastern Central Highlands of New Guinea, illustrated in this paper.

This, together with the fact that they were rare possessions in this region, may account for the apparent inconsistency in their use and function. They served primarily and broadly speaking two magical purposes - increase of the food supply, and aid in inter-district warfare. They have, as far as can be discovered, no religious significance 66. The conclusions set out here are, however, only tentative. A great many more of these stone relics need to be collected 67, and with them their associated stories and details relating to their contemporary use. Although we can learn from the natives nothing of the extinct people who produced such objects, nor of their original use, the information we can obtain is not entirely irrelevant. The relics have not been discarded and thrown aside as archaic and out-moded, but have, on the contrary, been treasured, and the people have found for them a practical use. 66 Except when the mortar (Plate 1, d) was regarded as "sacred" - what was meant really was that it was in a sense "tabu". 67 Throughout this southern region of the eastern Highlands there are still many of these archaeological stones in the possession of natives, mostly buried in gardens for the increase of crops. Because these people are still dependent on their gardens, and will probably continue to be so, and because magical belief dies slowly, especially in an area where contact with aliens is still largely indirect, it may be some considerable time before they are willing to part with them. By then, much of their mythological background may have disappeared.</page><page sequence="27">574 Ronald M. Bern dt 9.

Appendix 13 Notes on Plates and Figures Plate 1 Figure a Remarks: frieze of weatherworn embossing. Measurements : diameter across top, 13.5 cm.; diameter at base, 10.5 cm.; height, 11 cm. Composition : por phy rite - igneous. Figure b Remarks : this specimen with its "knobs" suggests some "animal" clasping the central bowl : the three raised bosses at one end appear to be "feet" and are shallowly divided : on the opposite side is a central boss sug- gesting a "head" with two indents for "eyes". On either side of this central boss is a further knob perhaps signifying "hands" clasping the bowl. A conventionalized animal or bird may be intended, as was the case with some seen in the Chimbu district. The bowl is deep and smooth. Measurements: width across, from "feet" to "head", 23.5cm. ; width of bowl, 14.5 cm. ; standing height, 13 cm. Composition: kind of porphyry. Figure c Remarks : traces of rough indenting or frieze : an inverted raised "u" on one side, suggesting a conventionalized handle.
