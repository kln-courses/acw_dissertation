<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE, DEATH AND AMBIGUITY IN THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF INNER NAPLES ITALO PARDO University College London Death and mortuary practices in inner Naples are characterised by beliefs and activities related to problematic relationships between body and soul, and between this world and the other world. Death is seen as a process, a transition. This allows some softening of its meaning of social and psychological laceration and allows room for domains of ambiguity, negotiation and mediation which are crucial in the body and soul and in this world/the other world relationships as well as in local thought and practical life. Negotiation, mediation and ambiguity enhance flexibility in Neapolitans' ability to cope with the problems of ordinary life, and provide people with a frame of meanings to explain and control what is otherwise inexplicable and uncontrollable. Most of the people living in inner Naples have included the dead in coping with daily problems of existence and understanding its obscurities. Central in this philosophy is an elaborate representation of the supramundane which is strongly connected with a given idea of death. Death itself is seen as a public issue rather than a strictly private matter. It is never a hic et nunc event; it is rather a process, a transition from one clearly defined 'this worldly' state to a variety of positions in the hereafter.1 Such transition concerns both the body and the soul and is effected through complex mortuary practices. This is based on the belief that the living can, by their rites, influence the position of the dead, who are, in turn, perceived as having power in life. Similar mortuary rituals and connected symbols have been reported in rural south Italy and Europe. There is little suggestion, however, that they occur in other European urban settings. Yet, evolutionary prejudices apart, the Western urban character of the inner-city case does not preclude but indeed stimulates comparison. The ethnography presented here also sug- gests that in Catholic Europe a more complex relationship exists between body and soul than is generally assumed. Significantly, it is flexible nego- tiation rather than sharp opposition between this world and the other world which corresponds to this relationship.2 This article takes a case study from inner-city Naples to explore these questions. It is based on field research that I carried out in an inner-city area of Naples in 1978-80 and in successive visits. Drawing on this ethno- graphic material on death and on the relationships between body and soul and between this world and the hereafter, the article discusses the role of mediation, negotiation and ambiguity within the local philosophy and the Man (N.S.) 24, 103-123</page><page sequence="2">104 ITALO PARDO patterns of coping with life.3 The local context and rationale Like other Neapolitans living in the inner city, the people I studied are referred to, and define themselves, as popolino:4 the lower strata. The locals refer to the conglomeration of narrow streets and externally poor buildings where they have been living for generations as the 'quartiere'. The quartiere is socially and structurally similar to other old and populous areas in inner Naples and can be considered a product of the peculiar process of urbanisa- tion of the city. Apart from street-selling activities, the local economy is mainly based on 'informal', even illegal, economic transactions, including 'black' labour, smuggling of various goods, small unlicensed workshops and thousands of non-formal, sometimes non-paid, non-material 'work'-activities.5 A high level of formal unemployment, common to the city as a whole, is also found here. There is a kind of parallel between the popolino's negotiations and me- diations with the dead, and their similarly elaborate systems of negotiations and mediations involving the living, which allows better options in their lives than scholars such as Belmonte (1979) have perceived. Such options range from those strictly related to construction of identity and reputation to the explanation and representation of worldly activities (Pardo 1988). The popolino negotiate with the different levels of the supramundane hier- archy in order to obtain protection and help and reduce insecurity in their lives. Periodical collective rituals confirm the local value of beliefs and powerfully support individuals in their approach to the sacred. This negotiation involves dealing with the different categories of the dead. The significance of this will become clearer; for the moment we shall say that they include the cult of the known dead, the cult of souls in purgatory and the cult of particular saints. These cults involve believers at different social levels and occur throughout Naples with differences de- pending generally on the social stratum. The three categories of dead play different parts in the supramundane transactions of Neapolitans. The known dead have a relatively brief but intense relation of an unspecified kind with the living, who provide them with the appropriate 'refreshing' rituals in exchange for protection and mediation. Relationships of the living with souls in purgatory and particular saints are, by contrast, characterised by specified, direct exchange. The cult of the known dead occurs mostly outside the ecclesiastical institutions, whereas the greater part of the cult of souls in purgatory is performed within them. The Church knows about the first cult and officially forbids part of it: the worship of unburied skulls which are believed to be the earthly representatives of these souls. These remains of the dead buried ad sanctos6 fill the catacombs under some Neapolitan churches which are run by laymen with the local priests' acquiescence. Revering skulls is thought to give refrisco (refreshment) to their souls, which are expected to reciprocate with intermediary or direct help.</page><page sequence="3">ITALO PARDO 105 Consistent with the historical process of reinterpretation of the Catholic doctrine on the basis of new social needs and wants, ecclesiastical cults and beliefs include 'non-orthodox' aspects which respond to the popolino's 'needs'. The negotiation and compromise between popular religious beliefs and the Catholic Church seems even more problematic in the cults of the saints. Most of the worship is organised and performed outside ecclesiastical institutions, not always according to the theological rationale. Special associations controlled by laymen generally undertake the non-official, collective part of the cult. Both these associations and the numerous street-shrines built by believers in Naples are often officially ignored or condemned by the Church, but are tolerated by parish priests. As one of them said: although threatening Ecclesiastic authority, 'they are sometimes the only possible link with these people'. The power of the priest seems gradually to have been confined to the control of official places of worship and official rites (e.g. the unction, part of the funeral, certain parts of the cults of saints; see Prato 1983; 1985) through which those other parts performed outside the Catholic institutions are legitimised. Generally, such power is ambiguously exercised to allow as much control upon popular religious expressions as possible. The relationships of Neapolitans with the supramundane include its 'clandestine' side. As purgatory does at another level,7 this side constitutes a sort of supramundane complement to a given mundane condition; par- ticular living beings are believed to have symbolic sympathy with the ambiguous, 'liminal' dead. The belief in 'damned', 'liminal' spirits like the Monacello (literally, little monk) is perhaps the most widespread aspect of this part of popolino's 'worldview'. These dead are considered to exist in-between the two worlds; they may appear in the form of human beings, and the most common manifestation is that of the Monacello. The attitude of those spirits towards humans is unpredictable. No transaction seems possible with them, and they cannot be approached to solve mundane matters. However, the Monacello and similar spirits are used to account for what is otherwise inexplicable at a common-sense level. The representation of death The local idea of death as a transition has two corollaries: the necessity of a 'good death' and the practice of the double burial. Both entail a belief in the survival of the cognitive being and a close relationship between the corpse, the soul and the state of the bereaved and of the community. These corollaries have various implications which I will go on to consider. They form the key rationales in this socio-cultural system and belong to a frame of beliefs which allows cognitive control over the arbitrariness of death. Its biological processes especially require ritual and symbolic control, being the material evidence of death's challenging reality for the dynamics of local life.8 Robin Horton (1960) has suggested that the treatment of gods as instru- ments meeting human needs and desires is at the opposite end of a continuum from pure communion between God and worshipper. At the</page><page sequence="4">106 ITALO PARDO instrumental pole there is essentially a tie-up between social group and ritual group. The dead are significant foci in this relationship; in particular, the dead relative is seen as a surviving non-material entity acting as a point of conjunction of the secular and sacred. Such synthesis is regarded as the right and natural outcome of the process of death. This desired result of the deceased's definitive passage to the other world, and the attempt to reduce the social and emotional disruption entailed by death, are among the most interesting aspects of Neapolitan representations of death. The idea of death as a process and the related rituals, cults and beliefs clearly contrast with the Western rationale of natural, de-ritualised death (in Weber's sense; see also Fuchs 1969) and with the ecclesiastical effort to bound it in the moment of 'departing'.9 Such temporal flexibility of death has two implications: it allows a softening of its meaning of social and psychological laceration; it also allows room for something going wrong, and, therefore, for the explanation through such 'disordering' irregularities, of non-usual or unpredicted events and the precariousness of life, as well as of misfortune. Such a long and complex process allows the creation of the ideal existential order. This 'paradox' is pragmatically justified and resolved: disorder creates order through logical operations whose basic elements are commonly shared and change diachronically. In the lights and shadows of this paradox, mediatory roles, ambiguities and anomalies find their place. They are relevant for the cognitive and social dynamics of social organisation; thus understanding them helps us to grasp some of the most inexplicit or apparently 'odd' aspects of this social reality. The importance and use of the past (the various types of dead) in the present (the living's life) and in its concrete dynamics and requirements brings out the centrality of the representation of death for studying this society. The following discussion will illustrate this point. For the moment, we start by considering the expectations arising on the occasion of a death and the process of reworking the social organisation throughout the two years between the first and the second burial. Local people base most of their hope in the supramundane upon the figures of the sacred hierarchy (saints, Madonna, souls in purgatory). These hopes are bolstered by the possibility of a newly-dead relative intervening- on their behalf-with these figures. Such intervention, it is believed, is possible only if funerary rituals are well performed, as this may allow the soul a good other-worldly status. Living relatives are those most likely to receive help from the deceased. Yet other people, according to the kind and degree of their relationship with the deceased, may hope for his/her intervention. Thus virtually everybody has a personal interest in the death of a known person, and in the 'proper' performance of rites. The idea of a 'good death' The relationship the Neapolitans, especially the popolino, see between the state of the body and the destiny of the soul, informs various precautions between death and the second burial. In this period the soul is believed to</page><page sequence="5">ITALO PARDO 107 depart, and the living try to facilitate such passage with appropriate prayers (Pardo 1983) and family rites. To ensure everything goes well so as to allow the living to use the prefix buonanima (good soul) when naming the deceased, certain rules must be observed from before death. Close relatives surround the dying person and look after him or her, taking care he or she does not refuse to acknowledge the coming death. A good death depends on such acceptance which, in turn, rests upon a fulfilled life and a quiet dying. As a man said: 'even if one doesn't accept quietly one's destiny, death comes anyway. In that case the damned soul of that person remains in that house forever'. A refusal to accept one's own death-equally with violent or premature death-might jeopardise or prevent the passage, producing a spirit lying inbetween the two domains and hovering forever over that house. The dying person shows acceptance by keeping silent about his/her condition and ratifies such acceptance by briefly 'touching the earth (the floor) before going'. His/her affirmation of formal order is the logical basis upon which the bereaved can rebuild it in their own lives after the confusion and disorder of death. Consistent with the non-Western examples (Huntington &amp; Metcalf 1979; Bloch &amp; Parry 1982), as well as with medieval (Aries 1981) or contemporary rural Europe (Douglass 1969; Danforth &amp; Tsiaras 1982; Goldey 1983; de Pina Cabral 1986) and U.S.A. (Waugh 1948; Huntington &amp; Metcalf 1979: 'Conclusions'), a good death is a death accepted both by the dying and his/her relatives, and well performed: it is a death explained. In opposition to an 'anomic' and private death, it is public. The publication and socialisation of the death starts only after the close relatives have checked and accepted the lack of breath. Their crying and invoking the deceased's name, perhaps in an extreme attempt to keep him alive, informs the immediate neighbours. Now that the first, dangerous, moment of the whole process of death has passed their cries are less likely 'to upset the deceased'. Nevertheless, even now some care must be taken 'because he's still sensitive and may be upset by too much crying and may become damned'.10 The presence of the new death and of its pollution is thus speedily disclosed. In contrast with Western patterns of 'lonely death' and 'isolation of mourners' (Gorer 1965; Kubler-Ross 1970; Aries 1981; Elias 1985), in this European urban reality death and its meanings are worked out 'collectively'. Other relatives and close friends are informed by telephone, while the half-open door and mortuary placards broadcast the news locally. Before the house is opened to neighbours, friends and distant relatives, the body starts receiving special attention: it is washed with surgical alcohol 'which disinfects and cleans, without moistening it'. Humidity is inappropriate for a quick desiccation. The use of water is, therefore, considered inconsistent with anything concerning the corpse. It is dressed in new pyjamas or a night-dress and, if male, shaved, then disposed in a single bed with its feet facing the door 'to facilitate the departure'. This posture characterises the dead and is avoided by the living.</page><page sequence="6">108 ITALO PARDO The mirrors in the bedroom are covered 'in order to avoid the deceased being frightened and consequently damned' and unable 'to leave the mirror, the room...'. Also, the doubling of death through the mirrored image of the deceased is avoided. Like subsequent arrangements in the church, lights are kept on and four 'lively' candelabra surround the death bed. The situation must be controlled, and the house illuminated to avoid shadows in which the spirit might hide: an overstrong attachment to life is attributed to the deceased, and these precautions reduce the danger of his remaining in this world. Yet, these ritual performances for a good and peacefully accepted death are considered insufficient to transform the deceased into one who has passed on. Things, we shall see, are more problematic. Death and sexuality Women perform the opening phase of the rite. For 'various reasons' men leave the mortuary room soon after death; they return to it once the house is open to mourners. Fertile, menstruating women are generally considered and often consider themselves somewhat impure. They do most of the housework and the related dirty jobs, and there are things they cannot do during their period because they are polluted. Due perhaps to such peri- odical symbolic impurity and to the affective and social nearness to the new death, only close female relatives and sometimes neighbours-generally middle-aged, but not necessarily post-menopausal-'who're experienced in life and know what must be done' wash and lay out the body and deal with it generally. Perhaps because of their 'ambiguous' state they are apparently perceived as symbolically closer, therefore less exposed to the dangerous contaminating meanings of the corpse and of death itself. These will not jeopardise their worldly status. These women, I would argue, bear symbols of sexuality and vitality, which is exactly what the corpse is symbolically discarding while the soul leaves it. Here the correspondence between the state of the deceased and that of the living is stressed at a physical level. A sort of symbolic affinity exists, then, between the new corpse and the physical condition of these living. When death occurs middle-aged women are doubly polluted by their menstruating state and by their nearness to the death. At the second burial their ambiguity allows the symbolic correspondence to continue in an almost reversed situation. They may still be fertile and sexually distinct, but they are also erotically neutral; 'they don't face men with temptation'. By means of symbolic opposition this particularly associates them with the dry, pure, asexual condition of the mummy. They are once more the protagonists of the relationship between the living and the corpse. The remains will be handled, cleaned, physically controlled by the 'community' through its appropriate hands: 'special' female members. Apart from grave-diggers, men do not seem so invulnerable and only occasionally help with mortuary practices. They have few physical contacts with the corpse and only kiss it soberly, while women also embrace it. This contrast is stressed by women's greeting the corpse as they greet the living,</page><page sequence="7">ITALO PARDO 109 while men who in given circumstances would embrace and kiss that living person keep apart from his/her corpse. Sexuality is strongly related to sin. The use of the colour white in the funerary regalia for a young or unmarried person's death is symptomatic. The colour white is purity, innocence; it characterises virgin brides. Sexually inexperienced people are free from such sin and are associated with these themes-especially children, who are by definition 'without sin'. The op- position body/soul is mediated here by the lack of sin, especially that relating to sexuality. Consequently, children are believed to enter heaven rapidly, necessitating only a short period of mourning. Conversely, precariousness in the hereafter as a consequence of sexual sinning sheds light on the precarious condition of ambiguous living. For instance, sexually ambiguous people such as homosexuals or transvestites are especially guilty of abusing sexuality and can achieve a good position after death only with great difficulty. As it lacks the mitigation of repro- ductive purpose their sexuality is an especially sinful, staining transgression. This and their 'anomalous' behaviour and 'strange' aspect locates them in a more precarious position than 'normal', heterosexual people. Enlighten- ingly, married people without children are considered 'incomplete': the theological rationale of marriage is unfulfilled and their sexuality flagrantly exists without reproduction, and such sex is socially challenging, as well as sinful. The relationship between body and soul and between the mundane and the supramundane domains is further clarified by the association of death with ambiguity (discussed in a later section). The after-death in the process of a good death The bereaved must wear black garments to show their new symbolic and social status. Some items are bought by close neighbours or relatives: the group clarifies their new position and shows its solidarity, control and support. This is the first material mortuary gift received by the bereaved, who will reciprocate in similar circumstances. While more distant relatives wear a black button-shaped brooch, a black tie and a band sewn on the jacket characterise men in strict mourning, and black stockings and head-squares are the first mourning clothes bought for women, who will later dress fully in black. The local 'community' ensures that their legs and hair be hidden. These symbols of their sexuality-vitality contrast with the situation of death and of the 'hoped for' devitalisation of the corpse. Vitality contrasts with the meanings of mourning, and here female sexuality is vitality: it is only with difficulty restrainable, it is con- taminating, hot, disordering. In the maximum disorder following death people need to reaffirm order. Any further disordering symbol must be at least controlled. Constraints on the bereaved, especially women, are explicable in this framework. Self-imposed and community-imposed prohibitions on listen- ing to music, going out and other leisure activities characterise the bereaved's social seclusion during the first weeks after burial. Pressure</page><page sequence="8">110 ITALO PARDO decreases as the death becomes more distant and less dangerous, and the soul closer to the other life. There is, of course, a wake. But it is not simply a gathering of people to express sympathy. Throughout the wake the house is open to visitors, who comment on the performance of death rituals. Just outside it well-in- formed participants in the rite converse softly and inform newcomers about the death. This conversation prepares the newcomers for psychological alliance with the bereaved. Then they pass the threshold11 'to pay (their) respects to the deceased and offer (their) condolence to the family'. Contrasting symbols are stressed in the room: the corpse and weeping bereaved coexist with 'lively' lights and flowers. The newcomer contributes his or her grief and flowers; having greeted the corpse and the bereaved, s/he sits and speaks with them about the death and the deceased. Such talking is a form of creativity that helps the construction of a 'good' deceased/spirit; in an attempt to objectify and contrast nothingness death is simultaneously denied and affirmed. Episodes of the deceased's life are recalled and only good is said of him, otherwise the clarification 'I'm talking about the body, not about the soul' is carefully added. Prayers are performed independently of the priest, who departs after administering unction. A visitor cannot easily leave; sympathy demands that he spends time with the bereaved. The fear of being involved in death seems overcome by the need to make sure that everything is performed properly. Such apparent inconsistency is explained by the symbolic importance and precariousness of this ritual phase. It is during the wake, around midnight, that, it is believed, the spirit leaves the house through the half-open door. The deceased is constantly watched over until around midnight, when the attendants 'need a break, also to let the room take air'. The importance of the wake for a good death is stressed by the widespread concern with taking the corpse home when death occurs in hospital: 'the deceased needs the warmth of his bed to accept his death'. Since the law insists that the corpse must stay in the hospital's morgue, a medical certifi- cate falsely affirming the deceased 'is near to death' is needed. According to my informants, Neapolitan doctors sometimes provide this, perhaps because of a 'sympathy' with people's beliefs. As with the widespread belief in the Monacello among the Neapolitan bourgeoisie, this 'sympathy' suggests a possible sharing of the most fundamental beliefs among the various social strata. However, this and the time discrepancy between physical death and its social recognition belong to a wider framework including people's concern with controlling the time and place of death, and its biology especially. Once the undertakers have placed the deceased in the coffin the relatives kiss him for the last time and place next to him a picture of his patron-saint and a small bottle with his name and the dates of birth and death. The final part of the departure can, now, take place: the coffin is carried away amid invocations of the deceased's name. This practice 'assures his identity even after putrefaction': the living have an interest in ensuring his individuality and therefore guaranteeing a clear</page><page sequence="9">ITALO PARDO 111 point of reference for their future relations with him. This is also a pre- caution: the burial of both the deceased and his details assures them he has definitely gone; his identity, his social personality too. He has nothing more to claim. Everything has gone well; this first important part of the ritual has been properly performed and his other-worldly patron is with him, physically near to his body. He (his spirit) should now be satisfied: refusal to pass is no longer expected. Yet other symbolic performances stress this point. Once the body has gone one of the female relatives ritually sweeps with a broom to 'free the house of the presence of death'. The ritual throwing of a handful of soil (which Morin (1970) sees as a magic defence), the placing of the gravestone and the words on it further confirm the departure, which is made irrevocable by the precautions the bereaved take throughout the process of mourning to ensure that the spirit will not return. The funeral procession to the nearest church includes a round of the neighbourhood. It shows the relation between the social significance of the deceased and the performance of the rite. Differences in people's participation and behaviour are striking. The funerals of important in- dividuals are characterised by the participation of many people, luxurious funeral cars and plenty of expensive flowers. This contrasts with the austere and quick funerals of children; the elaborate, well-attended but not neces- sarily rich funerals of ordinary adults; and the different ritual duties appropriate to the different status of dead women (adolescent, fiancee, married...). All the relatives share in the burial except those 'who can't do it because emotionally and physically distressed'. The rite at the grave includes the presence of a priest and a common prayer. 12 For the bereaved to eat before the burial is generally considered unacceptable; they only drink coffee. Once the deceased has gone and the physical empathy with the bereaved is reduced, their nutrition is considered important and is encouraged: bereaved and society must keep alive in spite of their closeness to death. Meat is, however, banned,13 'it's human flesh that one eats: one has just buried one's flesh... Meat must not be eaten now'.14 With the return of the bereaved there begins a process of the social and individual elaboration of mourning (see Pardo 1982). Deep mourning (Krupp 1962; Gorer 1965) lasts a couple of weeks, leading to gradual readmission of the bereaved into normal routine. This process finishes with the second burial. Changes in the colour of the clothes, in the mourners' patterns of sociability, in the frequency of their attendance at the grave, in their public and private behaviour, etc., are all evidence of time passing and of individual and social conditions changing according to the gradual reduction of the impurity and disorder represented by the corpse's putrefy- ing flesh. About two years after death, the closer relatives gather to exhume the body; this has great social and symbolic importance. The behaviour of the living and their statements well show the emotional tension characterising this rite. While approaching the cemetery they express to each other the hope that 'everything goes well'. The sign of this is that the remains must</page><page sequence="10">112 ITALO PARDO be in order (the desiccated corpse must not be broken) and dry. The successful accomplishment of the final stage of the passage of both the soul and the bereaved requires the complete separation between the two elements of life-body and soul. Only then can the remains be extracted from their 'tomb-womb' (Morin 1970) and the relatives be sure that the transition is complete. The essential act now is checking the corpse. Having lifted the coffin, the grave-diggers open it: if the corpse 'is in order' as hoped, this is evidence that a not-too-sinful life has been followed by a good process of dying. 15 Such evidence also confirms that the passage has been accomplished and is, therefore, a sign of the soul's good state and of the appropriateness of ritual performances during the process of mourning. The bereaved give the good news to the others by crying and declaring that they have 'definitely lost' their relative. The grave-diggers then lay the mummy (as it can be called) against the wall of the covered graveyard to stress its 'good state'. This ritual show of the definite symbolic death of the body and birth of the soul in the world of the dead generally occurs after the grave-diggers have cleansed the mummy; they are sometimes helped by the close relatives, who bring the needed material. Again, impurity implied in the symbolic cleansing requires the use of surgical alcohol 'to avoid wetting the remains'. The mummy is then wrapped in a sheet which will be periodically changed to give 'relief to the remains and refreshment to the soul. The social creation of the good spirit can now be accomplished. Those present comment with satisfaction on the 'good' state of the corpse, so legitimising the passage. Finally, the remains of the now definitely de-functus dead person are placed in the family niche or chapel. By contrast, burial in the communal ossarium is regarded as evidence of a death not well performed, a sort of sad passport to a long stay in purgatory. Only 'aban- doned' remains whose exhumation has not been undertaken by relatives are buried there. If still 'wet', the corpse is reburied and the period of mourning must continue with symbolic and practical consequences for the survivors. These must accept that something is wrong either with the deceased's life and actions, with his dying or with the process of death, including their ritual duties and the actual passage of the soul. They also must continue ritual performances, including the expenditure of time and money on frequent visits to the cemetery, flowers, renewal of soil-rent and repetition of ex- cavation. Should the deceased have relatives and the remains be improperly re- buried or dealt with, the moral responsibility falls entirely on them, which implies symbolic consequences and social disapproval. Moreover, if buried in the ossarium the remains lose their individuality and the living have no hope either of its intercession or, more generally, of a close link with the soul. The establishment of the deceased in the hereafter corresponds to his relatives' complete 'normalisation'. This is consistent with the symbolic</page><page sequence="11">ITALO PARDO 113 relationship between the state of the soul, that of the body and the condition of the survivors and the community which has been symbolically stressed since death. The survivors, now, definitely lose the 'status' of bereaved and resume that of ordinary people. Such process is marked by symbolic changes. Clothes-which from the original black had become grey, or black and white-can again be variously coloured and widows or widowers can remarry. The change is somehow stressed by the attendants eating together after the rite, at the close relatives' house. The material and the non-material aspects of the deceased's presence in this world are in a closely related state in which the first logically reinforces the second. In order for there to be symbolic representatives of near souls these must have a form; i.e. be in the family niche, which the relatives periodically visit 'to bring flowers or change the sheet'. After the final burial the remains only apparently lose importance; they still are essential if the living are to have confidence in their continuing relationship with these souls. Indeed, the deceased symbolically remains part of the household, particularly the sacred space of the family shrine which is the focus of the supramundane powers in which the inhabitants principally believe and hope, a numinous centre in the ordered and clean space of the house. The shrine includes the pictures of the family's other-worldly patrons and of the known dead. These are invoked in prayer and sometimes addressed in a conversational way. While among the Neapolitan bourgeoisie only part of such beliefs and rites are retained, for the popolino death remains not merely a social and psychological amputation (Gorer 1965; Borne 1981). It is a social event, a complex transition that is actually made up of other transitions: that of the body, of the soul, of the survivors and of the society.16 Such complexity allows room for powerful domains of ambiguity. Death and ambiguity Although every care is taken to assure a good death, the results of bad deaths (premature, violent...) haunt ordinary life, and many old houses of Nea- politans. These spirits have significance in the local belief systems and ritual practice. As recent research shows, they have indeed importance in the popolino's managing existence (Pardo 1986; 1988). These spirits directly recall two crucial aspects of the idea of death as a passage: a good death, and its completion through a well-performed second burial. Similar to the ideas about wandering souls in Portuguese (Goldey 1983), Berawan (Huntington &amp; Metcalf 1979) or Singalese (Kapferer 1983) ethnographies, 'these entities are neither here, nor beyond'. They are unsettled forever, in a grotesque condition of stable precariousness. With a few variations the evidence of their presence generally consists in the conjunction of various 'signs' such as the feeling of a heavy weight on one's body during sleep; unexpectedly finding money-generally coins- anywhere in the house; unusual visual or auditory experiences, or other 'abnormal' signs within the household; repeated misfortune or illness of its members or unusual good luck. When death breaks the normal course of</page><page sequence="12">114 ITALO PARDO a 'full life' it is perceived as particularly disrupting. It prevents accomplish- ment of individuals' tasks in life and is thought to produce liminal spirits that remain near the living and can intervene as they like in this life with strange, unpredictable behaviour. Such behaviour is believed to be moti- vated by a strong wish to live, and by envy of the life of the living. The living cannot enter into transactions with these spirits; they can only 'keep silent' about their presence.17 The randomness of death brings about ran- domness in life for the survivors. These entities have the anthropomorphic forms of the Monacello, the Pacchiana (a funny, female peasant), etc., but never resemble dead relatives. They seem a 'concretisation' of people's fear both of losing the dead's help and of having a precarious existence after death. The latter is especially dangerous since it entails the threat of a return of the dead. Conversely, these spirits' condition being mainly associated with the idea of damnation recalls the Catholic concept of damnation as the only true, eternal death: the sterile death which does not produce any life in the hereafter and entails consequently a definitive withdrawal from the vision of God (Landsberg 1953). The begging monk is probably the model for the anthropomorphisation of liminal spirits. This is an example of the association sometimes established between the ambiguous beings of the two 'opposed' domains. 18 Such relationship has its focus in that between the Monacello and 'badly baptised people'; its symbolic complexity is well shown by the case of homosexuals and transvestites who are said to deal easily with these spirits, or that of widows who occupy a special place in the connexion between sexually and socially 'anomalous', 'ambiguous' figures and the themes linked to death. The symbolic meanings of the widow as a sort of 'perennial' bereaved who is sexually neutral merit further attention. Such position is based upon her social and affective links with her husband and must be shown by her wearing, until her own death or a new marriage, the black garments of mourning which underline her close relationship with her late husband and her continuing his family task. This double ambiguity gives the widow special power to communicate with other-worldly entities but also locates her in a symbolic position similar to the Monacello's. While the latter sym- bolises the unacceptability of a death which leaves 'unfinished tasks', the widow seems to have the powerful status of a material (social and economic reification of her husband's unfinished life. Nevertheless, the liminality/am- biguity of the Monacello and of the widow differ at least in that the Monacello's is permanent, depending on his own nature, while the widow's is temporary. It derives from her husband's temporarily precarious position in the hereafter, and her performing simultaneously both her own and her husband's role. Apart from implying an increase in the woman's economic and social power, such ambiguity contradicts local existential categorisation. The widow's taking such an unpleasant ambiguous position seems to prevent her husband becoming a liminal spirit, which would be the logical result of an interrupted life. Her continuing his tasks avoids problems at both the</page><page sequence="13">ITALO PARDO 115 levels we are considering: this world and the other world in their various typologies. Ambiguity/liminality is constantly a potentially dangerous con- sequence of errors, transgressions or inadequacies in performing the funerary rites that involve the individual and his group at different levels. Even a properly dead person needs assistance from the living to avoid 'eternal' purgatory. Neglected, 'abandoned', souls are the focus of a cult whose rationale is directly linked to the idea of purgatory as a supramundane mediatory state. Such a 'state' depends on a problematic relationship be- tween ordinary dead people's remains and their souls, as well as on the attitude and behaviour of their relatives. Souls in purgatory and the cult of skulls Despite the decisions taken by the Second Vatican Council, Neapolitan Catholics, particularly the popolino, continue to believe in the possibility of transaction, mediation and negotiation with dead humans who are not saints. Along with near souls, souls 'perpetually in purgatory '19 are among the most immediate supramundane interlocutors. The attention the popolino pay to unknown skulls is not surprising considering the relevance that the body, its processes and material destiny either in life or in death-have, here, in the destiny of the soul. We know that their symbolic importance makes the dry remains the protagonists of the final stage of the mortuary process; especially 'the skull which lasts longest, it's the most important part of human remains'. For Thomas (1975), it is the focus of the symbolic meanings of life, vitality and sexuality, and is simultaneously the symbol par excellence of concreteness, duration and stability: three fundamentals for the popolino. Bones are considered the material representative of the dead. They are a significant synthesis between the synchronic and the diachronic order, as well as between the determinate and the indeterminate, a powerful threshold between two different domains and their implicit meanings. This somewhat ambiguous position is underlined by the skull representing order because of its dryness and accomplished death, while representing disorder because of being unburied. Here the security of the accreditation of that soul to the supramundane shown by the completed putrefaction and the tangible security of the material remains converge. Mundane mediators are the material correspondents of these souls in this life; they parallel their role in a way that may be more or less material but which is, in any event, concrete (Pardo 1988). As also happens with these mundane mediators (Pardo 1985a), a durable relationship of reciprocal advantage can be established with those dead whom Catholicism has op- portunely placed in purgatory, between heaven and hell. The local representation of the hereafter does not match the Church's emphasis on both hell and heaven. For the popolino, heavenly grace and the punishment of hell are definitive conditions in which little can be negotiated. Having reached one of them the dead can do little for the living, whereas they retain mediatory power throughout their stay in purgatory.</page><page sequence="14">116 ITALO PARDO Heaven and hell are, therefore, relatively irrelevant in local views of life, whether mundane or supramundane. The popolino's idea and representation of purgatory is far more complex and defined than the official one.20 Almost all dead stay in this intermediary stage for a varying period during which they suffer thirst and unrest. Its length depends on their sin, which can be alleviated by indulgences gained through charity and other particular acts. Such stay also depends on the living relatives' prayers and offerings. This purgatory seems the ideal, ef- ficacious and worldly rewarding resolution of the opposition of hell/heaven. The symbolic equivalents of the meanings of such opposition are rarely found in the popolino's negotiating, intermediating, precarious, everyday life. All this stresses the importance of the negotiations between the living and the dead and helps to explain why Neapolitans and more generally Catholics cling to their belief in purgatory (Landsberg 1953). Instead, as in this case, more elaborate beliefs may be developed, and a more detailed iconography of purgatory may be constructed to satisfy practical exigencies in life, such as finding a husband, improving a relationship, avoiding military service, finding a job, passing exams, etc. The souls of the unburied, neglected dead cannot leave purgatory; they are pezzentelle (ragamuffins), probably the Neapolitan equivalent of Van der Leeuw's 'poor souls' (1956). The sculptures of 'abandoned souls' are placed in niches located in the middle of the structure of the street-shrines: they are in an intermediate position, between the saints above and healers or other famous miraculous dead (such as Padre Pio or Madre Flora). But they are also between hell and heaven: the upper half of their handcrafted pottery body is out of the punishing flames whence they hopefully look to the sky, whereas its lower part is still suffering the pains of the purifying heat. Their symbolic correspondence with the abandoned skulls is some- times emphasised by the presence of a skull (real or not) in the niche. If helped, people hope these souls will reciprocate by relieving the believers of what they call their 'earthly purgatory'. The major difference between souls in perpetual purgatory and the dead relatives who stay there only temporarily apparently lies in the former's eternally needing help. Near souls after a given period leave purgatory to win paradise, thereby becoming more distant and less helpful. With 'aban- doned souls' it is possible to have more durable-although less intense-transactions. Although the skull-worship is individual and only one particular skull is directly worshipped, believers carefully revere them all. Worshippers walk through the catacombs alone or sometimes in ritual processions led by old women in black garments who are the ritual memory and perhaps the roaming 'souls' of catacombs. These-disappearing-ritual experts know the proper way of performing the rite and the half Latin and half Neapolitan formulae whispered or sung. During this walk believers 'precautionally' pray briefly before each niche and caress the lid, to avoid an overstrong commitment to any chosen skull and, consequently, involve- ment in the condition of the corresponding soul. As happens with the corpse, it is essential for believers to avoid a 'spiritual contamination', an</page><page sequence="15">ITALO PARDO 117 indissoluble link which would jeopardise their ordered position. The rela- tionship is, therefore, restricted to a precise period whose duration is established from the beginning. Meanwhile, the worship cannot be inter- rupted because, as a woman said, 'you wouldn't be forgiven... and would be compelled by frightening dreams to placate the spirit'. This recalls similar dreams concerning the dead relatives' remains, should periodical visits to the niche not be accomplished and the sheet changed. Throughout such a relationship believers bring flowers and candles. In exchange for the favour or grace they have asked, they sometimes enshrine the skull in a wood, glass or marble urn. A mythical story is attached to the most miraculous skulls.21 The eternal precariousness of these souls is something the living espe- cially try to avoid for themselves and their dead relatives by the proper performance of rituals throughout the process of death until the crucial moment of the second burial, whose symbolism emerges even more clearly in this context. Here a two-fold aspect of the non-material dominates death in two different, although not completely opposed, existential and temporal re- spects: the liminal spirits on the one hand, and near-souls, souls in purgatory and saints on the other. We have seen that the period before death, death itself, the after death, the funeral and the first burial are all moments in the process of death which are scrupulously ordered to prevent the deceased's damnation. This might frighteningly imply the soul's becoming a liminal spirit, which would be more dangerous than useful for the living. But the period between the first and the second burial and the burials themselves also play different roles in the process of death as they have different motivations and purposes. Once liminality is avoided with a good death, the danger still remains to the soul of perpetual purgatory. The ritual performances preceding death are then the necessary but not sufficient basis for respecting the prescrip- tions, prohibitions and ritual rules until the second burial. Mortuary rites must be performed correctly, but their adequacy also depends on their completeness. Rich and elaborate funerals not only satisfy the deceased, they also contribute to a definition or to a redefinition of the position of the deceased and his relatives. The existence of confraternita confirms such concern with properly performed rituals. They ensure the performance of funerals and the burials for their members, besides providing economic assistance. Especially, becoming a member facilitates obtaining a burial place. The ambiguities and mediations discussed so far-although lying in the domain of disorder-thus intriguingly serve to stress order and stability, and a pragmatic logic allows their circumstantial adaptation as explanatory paradigms. Ambiguities and mediations in explanation and practical life The foregoing has set out the practical and symbolic importance of the various types of dead in the life of the living. The theoretical value of this</page><page sequence="16">118 ITALO PARDO emerges from the analysis of some logical manipulations included in these systems of thought. Cults such as that of near souls or of souls in purgatory facilitate more direct negotiations with the supramundane but do not resolve the inexplicable or the unpredictable within the popolino's life. Beliefs in liminal supramundane beings increases options for cognitive and practical manip- ulations, and provide answers to such insecurities. Such beliefs help the living to abstract from the domain of the uncontrollable, and explain by the presence of these spirits, more or less serious troubles such as illness, repeated failure in social and financial career, sometimes death. Such explanations of the facts of existence contribute to prevent chaos (Horton 1967; Southwold 1979) and enhance individual options in managing exis- tence. Events themselves, however, are not sufficient to justify or provoke the use of these explanations; different features must combine for a phenom- enon to be considered 'abnormal', and consequently to require 'particular' explanations. Liminal spirits appear only to people who are improperly or incompletely baptised, or who are existentially ambiguous for other reasons. General awareness of their presence is quite a common phenomenon which does not require particular attributes. Abnormality occurs when the spirit is 'seen'-the existential ambiguities of two different domains come in direct contact. If this happens an ordinary person knows that his/her place in life is unstable, and 'something was wrong in the baptism'; i.e. in the religious part of the rite of initiation to life. I have often heard that 'the priest must have been drunk'. The presence of liminal spirits in one's life not only reveals and creates precariousness, it also reveals a powerful potential privilege. Such a person is now aware of having a privileged relationship with these manifestations of non-mundane clandestine powers; this allows the possibility of control- ling one's own existence. One can now challenge its precariousness by observing the rules which define the relationships with these spirits. Like the various possibilities which confirm or deny existential uncertainty, these rules are diversified and negotiable. As evidences of existential disorder, these spirits are part of the problem of which they are supposed to be the solution. Some cultural aspects are, therefore, intellectually negotiated and pragmatically adapted. What ap- pears as a situation in which the paradigms which should allow causal explanations of special events actually entrench the problem is transformed into a consistent (Firth 1985) explanatory system. My informants never considered that a dead relative could remain liminal, as this would imply the inadmissible: a 'bad death' or an incomplete death ritual performance. Either of these hypotheses would mean that they did not expect help from them, which would jeopardise the logic of mortuary rituals and of these people's relationships with the dead. A bad or wrong performance also would add a social stigma to the survivors' guilt, further complicating their lives. Whatever the real facts, to proclaim (especially at the final ceremony) that 'everything has gone well' reduces problems at both the levels at which death is meaningful: the individual and the social.</page><page sequence="17">ITALO PARDO 119 Once we understand the ambiguous and mediatory categories of the people, the way is opened for us to analyse the role of these ideas in local life and of their cognitive and practical explanatory value for material and non-material facts of existence. The relationships between liminal spirits and 'special' living beings have clarified this. We have considered various relationships between the world of the living and the dead against the local correspondence assumed to exist between facts concerning the body, and those concerning the soul. This has produced insights in the logic and operation of these systems of thought and their value in life. The coexistence of souls in purgatory and liminal spirits in the local universes of cognition is meaningful. It crucially contributes to making flexible and multifaceted the relationships between the living and dead. If through licit or semi-licit cults, such as those of skulls and saints, people can hope to establish a link with the official sacred side of the supramundane, liminal spirits allow a covert relation with its clandestine, non-religious side. In spite of their unequivocal belonging to the non-material, all these 'entities' may be concretely present in this world and constitute effective, although different links with the hereafter. Things, however, remain flexible also at this level. Neither of the described dealings with the dead includes the purpose of pursuing direct, magic action upon the supramundane. To the known dead, people dedicate proper mortuary rites. From the skull-soul they ask intercession and promise rites. Saints are approached regarding more serious problems. In relation to the Monacello people keep quiet about his presence without asking anything of him:'it's no good to do that'; however, they wait: if his anger is avoided benefits should come. Liminal spirits do not explain only the strange, the abnormal in life. Unexpected luck-financial or not-may be considered evidence of their benevolence. Negotiations and manipulations in the areas of ambiguity and mediation existing within the two domains of the popolino's existence-the mundane and the supramundane-and between these two domains have, therefore, important effects upon their cognitive and practical life. Conclusions A negotiable relationship between this world and the other world corre- sponds, in inner Naples, to a complex, multifaceted and flexible symbolic relationship between body and soul. On this basis the popolino use the relationships with the various levels and figures of the world of the dead as part of managing existence. The cognitive and sociological dynamics analysed here find explanation in this framework. It also provides answers to the popolino's 'need' to explain the facts concerning their life in a way as wide and deep as possible. Such 'need' is an important guide-line to the various symbolic and ritual situations which mediate in and between the categories of existence and underline its ambiguities stressing their status of essential elements in the systems of explanation. Alongside various types of negotiations, such relationships between body and soul and between this world and the hereafter are, therefore, sufficiently</page><page sequence="18">120 ITALO PARDO problematic as to allow flexible domains of ambiguity, both mundane and supramundane. This adds room for manocuvre to people's strategies in coping with ordinary and extra-ordinary problems, and also increase their options in coping with existence at a cognitive level. When there is no common-sense explanation for people or events then beliefs in the liminal dead's influence in this world provide explanation. Little of everyday life is generally left unanswered or doubtful. Reminiscent, in a sense, of Azande (Evans-Pritchard 1937) or Mbembe (Harris 1965), a 'coherent' (Firth 1985) cognitive system normalises abnormality or incongruence. These complex relationships with the dead and the related religious and non-religious beliefs appear rational, in a Weberian sense, when seen in the light of their value in local cognitive and practical life. Such under- standing helps us to avoid not only stereotyping Neapolitans, it may also open our eyes to the complexities of this social and cognitive reality in the context of the modern organisation of the city. NOTES I am grateful to Dr Rosemary Harris, Dr Jonathan Parry and Professor Sandra Wallman for their insightful comments at various stages of drafting this article, and to Dott.essa Giuliana B. Prato for discussion of her material on the relationships between official reli- gion and popular religious expressions in Naples. Finally, this article has taken advantage of the helpful comments of anonymous readers for Man. 1 Many of these themes which I discuss here have been discussed from slightly different perspectives in Hertz 1960; Huntington &amp; Metcalf 1979; Bloch &amp; Parry 1982. 2 Comparative insights might come from other European ethnographies (see Douglass 1969; De Martino 1975; Brown 1979; Lombardi-Satriani &amp; Meligrana 1982; Danforth &amp; Tsiaras 1982; J.A.S.O. 1983; Feijo et al. 1983; de Pina Cabral 1986) as well as from those in which such a relationship is more clearly problematic (see, for example, Strathern 1976 and McKim Marriot 1976). Pardo 1985b attempts comparative analysis using literature on Euro- pean and non-European ethnographies. 3 Extended forthcoming work explores the broader sociological content of these dynam- ics (Pardo 1988). 4 The word no longer seems to retain the dismissive meanings it conveyed in the past. 5See Pardo 1988 and the definition of work in Wallman 1978. 6 This means burial inside or very near the church (Aries 1981). 7 The popolino describe their existential condition as their 'earthly purgatory', meaning that such a condition is characterised by insecurity and instability. 8 In societies such as the Lugbara, social control over natural death is established through deciding the event of death socially (Middleton 1982), and through establishing temporal priority of social death over natural death. This is evident in the Western practice of retirement, as an insurance against the natural death of individuals who are still produc- tive. 9 Cf. Rahner 1961, on the 'Catholic theology of death'. 10 Thomas discusses the cadavre sensible (1980: 33) and the attitudes towards the corpse generally. 11 The internal divisions of the home in the situation of death are important considering the opposition of the home to the apparently confused and generally unclean external space. Normally, the threshold marks the boundary; it is symbolically protected by objects such as horse-shoes, pictures of saints, or horns. According to sex, age and status, both private and public spaces have internal divisions which are apparently overcome in times of ritual disorder, especially death. When a death occurs, however, symbolic boundaries only shift; divisions between public and private domains remain (Bourdieu 1977). The organisa- tion of internal and external space is temporarily and partially reworked according to the</page><page sequence="19">ITALO PARDO 121 stress that in each ritual occasion is put upon one or another of the basic criteria of division. The boundaries between these two spatial domains (such as the threshold, the door itself, etc.) are stressed on such occasions. 12 With some exceptions, Neapolitans are buried in multistorey buildings. These burial places are built in local cemeteries on licence from the council. They take their name from the confraternita which administer them. Corfraternita are private associations dedicated to a saint or Madonna (see p. 118). The basement of these buildings is occupied by individual graves whilst the walls and non-members pay a fee for the interment. Should the family- niche be located in another building the remains are taken there when they are disinterred. 13 The fasting between death and the first burial recalls Easter, and the ban on meat is reminiscent of the ban on Fridays. 14 In Italian and in the Neapolitan dialect there is one word for both meat and flesh: carne. So, my informants did not need to specify. Yet, at least on this occasion, no distinc- tion seems to be actually made. 15 A positive correspondence exists between the length of agony and the sins of the dying person (Prato 1983). Also, the more sins the more painful and long the dying. 16 On this see Huntington &amp; Metcalfs detailed discussion (1979). 17 Nevertheless beliefs are passed on. As a man said: 'you know, when such important thing happens to you, you can't avoid mentioning it... to your wife, your children...'. 18 Begging monks do not completely belong to the non-religious life but are also per- ceived as marginal in the Ecclesiastical hierarchy. Unlike 'proper clericals', they informally deal with people and are familiar in ordinary life. Moreover, they are said to harass women sexually. Similarly, a woman's mother 'was badly annoyed by one of these (liminal) spirits. She couldn't sleep at night, and we too... She shouldn't have mentioned him. She also refused his advances... this, I think, brought her to death while still a young and strong woman. 19 I have analysed elsewhere the perception and control of time and condition of purga- tory (Pardo 1981). On the Catholic doctrine of purgatory see Michel (1939) and Colzani (1977). 20 Le Goff (1984) discusses the characteristics and genesis of purgatory. 21 This makes their souls less pezzentelle. It also underlines the meanings of tremendum and fascinans attached to the mysteriurn of the catacomb (Otto 1950) which are so important on the first ritual visit. REFERENCES Aries, Ph. 1981.

La mort est vue comme un processus, une transition. Cela permet certains adoucissements de son sens de laceration sociale et psychologique et laisse une place aux domaines de l'ambiguite, de la negociation et de la mediation qui sont cruciaux dans les relations corps et ame, aussi bien que dans la pensee locale et la vie pratique.
