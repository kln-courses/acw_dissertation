<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Ways of Ontology. NICOLAI HARTMANN. Translated by Rein- hard C. Kuhn. Chicago: Henry Regnery Co. [1953]. 145 pp. $4.00. Although Nicolai HIartmann is best known to the English-speak- ing world through his Ethics, he considered this work, which is itself by no means slight, to be merely on the "periphery" of his contri- butions to philosophy. His main concern was with ontology, to which he devoted most of the last twenty years of his life, and which is embodied in the four-volume sequence: Zur Grundlegung</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 109 der Ontologie (1935), Miglichkeit und Wirklichkeit (1938), Der Aufbau der realen Welt (1940), and Die Philosophie der Natur (1950). The little book under review may be considered a short synopsis of Hartmann's ontology. It first appeared in Germany in 1943, and was republished separately in 1947.1 It has now been trans- lated into English. I believe that it is the first of any of Hart- mann 's numerous writings besides the Ethics which has been made available to those who cannot read German. Considering the im- mensity of his philosophical output, this seems somewhat of a scandal. Moreover, it is unfortunate that this particular book was se- lected for translation, since it is not as important as the other writ- ings and was probably chosen merely because of its size. It should seem obvious that it is impossible to summarize a study of such proportions in so few pages. The richness of detail which is so characteristic of Hartmann's approach is entirely lacking, and the presentation sounds more dogmatic than usual. Hartmann mav be said to belong to the tradition of philosophia perennis represented by Aristotle, the Scholastics, Spinoza, Leibniz, etc. That is, he is primarily interested in the nature of reality, the kinds of bein(, etc., rather than in epistemology. He is a realist par excellence, maintaining as he does that it is easier to under- stand reality, i.e., the object of knowledge, than knowledge itself. He accepts the intentional view of knowledge advanced by Brent- ano, and contends that our epistemological categories are derived from ontological ones, rather than conversely, as Kant maintained (p. 19). However, he departs fromn his ancient predecessors in several respects. In the first place, he is more of a "naturalist " than mnost of them since he rejects God and immortality, and any anthropocentrie or anthropomorphic interpretation of reality. Thus, he denies that teleological categories ean be applied to reality in general. Moreover, he is an anti-reductionist aiid a pluralist. There are many "realms of being'" and it is a mistake to believe that they can be reduced to one or a few. For instance, he rejects both idealism and materialism for what they deny, and accepts them for what they affirm. Finally, he eschews the older a priori method, and prefers em- pirical phenomenologfical analysis-which is more difficult and 1 The German edition of the Neue Wege der Ontologie was reviewed in this JOURNAL, Vol. XLVII, No. 14, July 6, 1950, pp. 417-419.</page><page sequence="3">110 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY perhaps less precise but truer to the facts of experience. "Cate- gorical analysis must keep close to the given phenomena, avoiding speculative conclusions, even those that have a certain hypothetical value" (p. 112). This program suggests that Hartmann 's work might be ac- cepted more sympathetically among American naturalists than that of any of his continental contemporaries. Indeed, there are many similarities between his philosophy and that of Santayana. Hartmann's whole system of ontology may be said to be a de- scription of the various kinds of entities which have being. Per- haps it might be called a "map of the realms of being." A funda- mental distinction is made between ideal being and real being (reales Sein), which somewhat resembles the traditional distinc- tion between essence anid existence, although it is not identical with it (cf. Ontologie, p. 74). The realm of ideal being includes mathematical entities and values (the realm of Wesenheiten). Thus the discussion in the Ethics is concerned with only a small segment of Being, i.e., ideal Being. Most of the New Ways of Ontology is devoted to the realm of real being. Real being is distinguished from ideal being because "Everything real is in time" (p. 26), "the real is perishable and thereby also unrepeatable" (p. 26), and "everything real is in flux" (p. 28). There are four main kinds of real being: the inorganic world, the organic world, the psychic world, and the spiritual world. These are called "strata of reality" (Schichten). There are certain "categories" which are shared by the various strata, and some that are peculiar to each. Hartmann is careful not to give us a definition of the term "category" except to char- acterize it as a "fundamental assertion about being as such," or as a "constitutive principle'" of real things (p. 13). Categories thus determine all the entities within their particular stratum (p. 65). Examples of special categories are: space and time, causality, etc., for the inorganic world; adaptation and purposiveness, etc., for the organic; act and content, etc., for the psychical; and thought, freedom, evaluation, etc., for the spiritual world. In addition to these special categories there are categories which are common to all strata: "unity and multiplicity, concord and discord, contrast and dimension, discretion [sic] and continuity, substratum and relation, element and structure," etc. (p. 66). Hartmann conceives one of the principal problems of meta- physics to be the description of the interrelations of these categories,</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 111 i.e., the "laws of dependence and of autonomy." These laws de- termine how the stratum of living things is dependent upon in- organic reality, how the psyche is dependent on the body, etc. Hartman contends that the higher strata are dependent on the lower strata, but that they possess some autonomy or novelty over and above that of the lower strata. However, the types of de- pendence vary, since the relation of organic to inorganic is quite dissimilar to that of the psychic to the organic, or of the spiritual to the psychic. There are two basic kinds of dependence; super- information (Cberformung) and superimposition (uberbauung). It should be clear that Hartmann's system is extremely compli- cated, and that one misses any value that it may have by omitting the details of his analysis. One is tempted to ask whether it has any value at all. In answer, I shall make a few general comments -but must again warn that to do justice to Hartmann one cannot disregard the details. First, I think that there is a great deal of value in the kind of phenomenological-empirical description which he gives of the vari- ous types of reality and of their interrelations. His work calls our attention to the data which must be considered by any philosophi- cal analysis. It certainly is a fact that living things behave dif- ferently from inorganic things, and that an animal with a psyche is different from an animal without one. Moreover, Hartmann has done a great service by emphasiziilg that class of peculiar entities included under what Hegel called the "objective spirit," i.e., so- ciety, knowledge, etc., of which we as individuals appear to be carriers (cf. Das Problem des geistigen Seins, 1933). However, I find Hartmann's analyses to be far too "tolerant," since he accepts every traditional distinetion that has been made in ontology and by combination and permutation multiplies the number of entities in his universe with extraordinary abandon. Perhaps Occam's razor can be used indiscriminately, but it must be used sometimes. Moreover, I suspect that in portraying the interrelationships of these entities he has been seduced by his own technical terms, which are highly metaphorical. It is interesting to note that almost all of Hartmann's key terms are based on spatial metaphors, e.g., Schichten, Uberformung, Uberbauung, "transgression of boundaries," etc. (cf. p. 111). He quite cor- rectly criticizes the ancients for conceivingr of the relation between "higher" and "lower" forms of being in terms of ends and means, and he also shows that a genetic account (e.g., in terms of "emer- gence," i.e., earlier and later) presupposes an analytical one (cf. pp. 109 ff.). Nevertheless, I fail to see that we have learned much</page><page sequence="5">112 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY by being told that "higher and lower" is better understood as some mode of being "on top of"! In reading the voluminous works of Hartmann one cannot fail to be impressed by his immense learning and sensitivity to distinc- tions and differences, but when one is finished he rarely feels that he has gained any illuminating insight into the nature of things. I might add that the translation appears to me to be accurate as well as readable. I hope that Mr. Kuhn, if he feels inclined, will translate some of the more interesting books by Hartmann.
