IT is only within the last few years that William Stern has begun to attract attention as a philosophical thinker. His philosophy of Critical Personalism is expounded in a work entitled Person und Sache. The first volume, Ableitung und Grundlehre, published in 1906, has only recently appeared in a second edition; the next</page><page sequence="2">88 CRITICAL NOTICES: volume, Die mnmnschliche Persanlichkeit, published in 1918, has already reached a third edition. The third and concluding volume, Wer.tphilosophie, with which we are here concerned, was published in 1924. Stern's Critical Personalism has been developed chiefly in opposition to what he calls Abstract Idealism, though it shares with it the conviction that the "true nature of being is not to be found on the level of the given ". Nevertheless it regards the real not as idea, abstract and with universal validity, but as a hierarchy of persons, concrete and individual. Critical Personalism is also opposed to recent forms of philosophical humanism and pluralisms of the pragmatist type, rejecting, their anthropomorphic features and striving for a view of the Whole as unitats rnultiplex. Critical Personalism is essentially metaphysical resting on ultimate convictions not of the nature of propositions appealing simply to the reason. Metaphysics itself cannot be conceived as something final and fixed: it is always in flux, conscious that its task can never be fully accomplished. Though the existence of facts and the validity of values are categories of quite different order m3taphysics unites them in a form of ultimate conviction. In this volume Stern se-3ms to set himself two tasks: to describe con-eptions in which fact and value are related; and to give an analysis of the realm of values. He endeavours to expound a metaphysic3 in which Lebens-anschauund and Welt-anschauitng- philosophy of life and view of the world-are united. " Person" is by far Stern's most important conception, and to avoid misunderstanding in the later use of that term and relateil expressions, such as " I," it is best to indicate at once what he intends by it. " By person is meant an existent, which, notwith- standing the muliplicity of its parts, forms a real unity of its own kind and worth, and as such, in spite of the variety of functions of the parts, achieves a unified purposive activity of its own." " A thing is an existent, which, formed of a number of parts, con- stitutes no real unity of its own kind and worth, and with a variety of functions has no unified purpose of its own." Some of the English words used here, as for example, purposive, are not to be taken in a very definite or specific sense. The concept of person is very different from that of consciousness: it is much wider in its extension. Turning to the subject of value Stern maintains that the search for an a priori rational knowledge of value fails. Whether conceptual or presentative, it would be simply cognitive and not have the- practical character of value as realised in the person. On the other hannd mere empirical knowledge is insufficient, for the norm or standard lies outside of the empirical. Stern criticises the attempt to arrive at a philosophy of values through con- sideration of the particular values found in human culture. Philosophies of value so oriented in our day satisfy themselvds with a number of ultimate ideas of values under which the individual</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAM STERN, Wertphilosophie. 89 spheres of culture are subsumed, as the intellectual, the msthetic, the moral, and the religious. They fail to show how these values are related to one another, to a philosophy of life, or to a co-or- dinated view of the universe. Further, the principle of value is infinitely wider than human culture and its different spheres. The metaphysic of value must therefore be something other than a philosophy of culture. It cannot remain bound up with such an anthropomorphic view, but must start from categories which, not dependent on the limits of human culture, govern the whole world of values. The theory of values of Abstract Idealism must also be rejected, for the notion of an abstract existence of ideas of value is an absurdity (Ungedanke). It is a self-evident conviction that true being can be conceived only as effective being. As a matter of fact, Abstract Idealism has always tended to hypostatise and personify its ideas. But the significance of ideas is derivative. In a footnote Stern makes the important remark that the derivative character of ideas is not in their psychological existence in the consciousnesses of individual men. They have an objective char- acter as constituents of a higher whole, and are in a manner normative for the individuals co-ordinated within that. They are derivative in that they have no existence outside a " person " in Stern's sense. The ultimate conviction from which the consideration of values starts may be expressed in the affirmation: " I value, therefore I am." (Ich werte, also bin ich.) Stern then passe-3 to what appears a highly debatable inference, in fact, a non sequitur, for he says that the capacity of valuation implies the intrinsic value of the person valuing. " I value, therefore I am-value." (Ich werte, also bin ich-Wert.) For in valuing the " I posits itself as the value centre of a value cosmos ". The person affirms value as having validity, but as validity can have no meaning unless value exists, it posits it as existing. Thus we are supposed to have arrived at the recognition on the one hand of the value of the "' I," in valuing, and on the other of the value or values of the " not-I ", the objective, as valued. " I have value," and " There are values There is no definition of the concept of value, since there is no more elementary concept to which it might be referred. So much, however, may be said, that value is an adjectival conception: it is not itself a substance but attaches to such. We cannot rightly say: "This is a value," but only " This has value, or, is valu- able ". Stern classifies values as Selbstwerte, Strahl werte, and Dienstwerte. Strahlwerte might be translated literally as " radial values ". For a number of reasons it seems advisable to use the following equivalents for those terms: Intrinsic, Constituent, and Instrumental Values. Stern maintains that error is frequently incurred, both in treating Constituent Values as Intrinsic, as in the Abstract Idealist hypos- tatising of the ideas of the good, the true, and the beautiful, and also in regarding them as merely Instrumental, as by Pragmatism.</page><page sequence="4">90 CRITICAL NOTICES: This distinction of a class of values intermediate between Intrinsic and Instrumental Values is one of the original and most interesting contributions of the volume. Intrinsic value is absolute: but this "absoluteness " must not be identified with universality, immutability, eternity, or timelessness- Intrinsic value is absolute in the sense that it depends on nothing outside of it. Following out the implications of his fundamental metaphysical conviction, Stern equates intrinsic value with person. A person is an existent whole having intrinsic value. Only what, is a real whole has intrinsic value, annd only what acts as a whole, that is, is a functional whole, is a real whole. But what indicates, the bounds or limits of such a whole? A true whole, a genuine person is when there is not only activity starting from it, but when activity starting from it also in its aim in some manner comes back to itself. Such " self-determination" is the philosophical criterion of parson and of intrinsic value. Stern holds that he here arrives, at a union of the ideas of being and of value, and supplies a test, for judging any claim to absolute value. The act of valuation affirms the existence of values: the values. of the persons valuing and the values of the objects valued. It is impossible to avoid recognition of a plurality of values, or, in other terms, of persons. It is, however, only by a metaphysical paradox that one may talk of a system of values. For the nature of a system is such that all its members are related: and the nature of intrinsic values is that they are dependent solely on themselves. Here, says Stern, we are at one of the crucial points of metaphysics, where the concepts of the intellect no longer suffice. What is not logically explicable must nevertheless be accepted as a fundamental fact of the world :-that some existents may at one and the same time be absolute and relative, have both intrinsic and in- strumental value. The term " system " is not satisfactory for such an ' overlogical?' combination, for a system ought to be capable ot reconstruction in thought, but this whole is open only to meta- physical conviction and intuition. The paradox is also apparent with reference to the problem of the gradation of intrinsic values- For gradation implies relativity to a standard, a sort of absolutis- simum, to which values, themselves absolute, are related. Stern meets these difficulties in part by the conception of a hierarchy of intrinsic values, or more correctly, a hierarchy of persons. having intrinsic values. The exact relation of persons in such a, whole cannot be adequately comprehended intellectually, but Stern insists that a whole need not shut out other wholes from itself: it may include them and their intrinsic values. A priori one arrives at the conception of the highest stage of the hierarchy, the All-person. One implication of this hierarchical arrangement is that the distinction between person and thing has only relative exis-ence in the realm of facts: it is a distinction of ways of looking at the same set of facts. For in the region of the finite, every whole is part of a higher whole, and to higher persons is,</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAM STERN, Wertphilosophie. 91 "thing". But the lower wholes do not lose their own intrinsic values by their inclusion in higher wholes. The concept of the All-person is reached a priori, but the intrinsic values or persons of the different stages of the hierarchy are to be known empirically. Except for the important consideration that Stern does not stress the psychical aspects his enumeration of the stages of this hierarchy is suggestive of Paulsen. The gradation of intrinsic values, otherwise the positions of persons in the hierarchy, is said to depend upon the extent of the "tfullness of intrinsic value" as compared with the All-person. From this notion of " fullness of intrinsic value," which Stern calls a category, one may pass to his distinction of " real " and " ideal " intrinsic values. As the person is a futnctional whole the nature of 'it. intrinsic value can be clearly understood only throuoh its openness to the world. But for the individual person the world has a double sense: as a system of forces in which it has its place, receiving, and giving; and as a hierarchy of intrinsic values into which it must fit itself and towards which it must take up its position. It is to the latter that the conception of ideal intrinsic value has reference. Real intrinsic value is the person as actual, the being living with its inner striving and its external influences. Ideal intrinsic value is a whole conceived as complete or perfect- not now a reality but a tendency to realisation. Each person is a, centre of the cosmos of intrinsic values, and each has a common relation to the value-universum, and this determines in some manner the ideal intrinsic value for each. Through its connexion with the value cosmos, the individual person has its religious rank and its ethical direction. The intrinsic value of a person is a quality of the whole as such, yet all that belongs to the person has some sort of share in that value. Nevertheless the part is something other than the whole, for in the part only a side of the being comes to effect. There is a tendency for the value in the part to be looked upon as merely of the status of instrumental worth. From another point of view the whole is present in the part, and then there is a tendency to treat values theremn expressed as intrinsic. Nevertheless such values are neither intrinsic nor instrumental: they have no independence of the person as a whole; and they are not simply instruments but constituents of the person. These are the interme-Jiate values, the Strahlwerte in Stern's terminology; the Constituent Values as it has been proposed to render that term. They are constituents of persons though they have not the self-determination and being characteristic of persons. Intrinsic values are said to flow in and. to express themselves in Constituent Values. From the metaphysical standpoint of Critical Personalism, the distinction of physical and psychical is not fundamental: the person is both. At some length, but proportionately indefinite and vague, the author endeavours to distinguish his view from that of Spinoza, and from modern forms of psycho-physical parallelism. The</page><page sequence="6">92 CRITICAL NOTICES: psycho-physical distinction has a central significance in the realm of Constituent Values. Having considered the forms of modality of Constituent Values and the question of their gradation, Stern passes to a description of the main types of these values. Con- sciousness, only a state of a person and not independent being, is a Constituent Value. Its treatment as independent being has led to the error of regarding it as of intrinsic value. Stern believes that the discovery of the "Unconscious " has been fundamental for metaphysical theory and psychological knowledge, and is perhaps still more significant for the valuation of the world. But the Un- 'conscious includes both that which is "over" and that which is " under" the conscious. One may speak of the unity of the person, but not strictly of the unity of consciousness, for this in order to attain its significance has continually to draw upon the "over" conscious. In his treatment of the various Constituent Values associated with self-consciousness, the person's experience of its- self as "I," Stern discusses the status of feelings of pleasure and pain. He seems to hold that both are inseparable from individua- tion. They betoken the conflict through which the person comes to self-consciousness. He makes the very debatable assertion that pleasure requires for its existenc3 both the existence of the capacity to suffer and the existence of actual suffering. Nevertheless, pleasure and pain are qualitatively different and cannot be quantitatively measured one against the other. And yet, in spite of the apparent correctness of this, may it not be asked whether there is not, in some theoretically inexplicable manner, in practice a sort of commensurability of all values, some sort of summation and comparison of totals ? Truth, regarded by Abstract Idealism as of intrinsic value, and by Pragmatism as instrumental, is a typical example of what Stern classes as Constituent Values. It involves as presupposition the intrinsic values of the knowing persons and of the objects known. Nevertheless, it is not a constituent of either alone, but of a unity in which both are present. There is a multiplicity of truths in the different stages of the hierarchy of persons. As expressed through ideas representing constituents of higher unities, they have an objectivity and something of the normative for persons lower in the hierarchy. It is difficult to surmise what might be Stern's theory of error, which he entirely fails to discuss. There is an important chapter on the historical. Persons, particular wholes of intrinsic value, may be finite in time, have a beginning and an end. Tnat appears to be his view as to particular human persons, and even of humanity, but there is much which is barely consistent with this, and he points later to a conception of God in which all persons, all intrinsic values, find their completion, perfection, and persistence. There is astonishingly little consideration of the asthetic. It is interesting to observe that even in the brief account of Instrumental Values, as throughout the book, the concept of " thing " plays practically no part.</page><page sequence="7">H. J. WATT, Sensory Ba8is and Structure of Knowledge. 93 In a third part of the volume Stern elaborates his views on 'Introception," by which he wishes to express the active relation of the individual person as real intrinsic worth to the Value-cosmos. Introception is contrasted on the one hand with theoretical sub- jectivism and practical egoism, and on the other with theoretical objectivism and altruism. In Introception the I makes the affirmation of the values of the not-I a constituent part of its. own intrinsic value. The fundamental forms of Introception are love, in its types as erotic; as in the family and in wider social wholes; "understanding knowledge," an intellectual comprehen- sion which is something more than theoretical science; a3sthetic appreciation and expression; and religion. FThe final chapter treats. of morality from the point of view of Critical Personalism, showing the meaning of Introception as the fundamental ethical ought. As contrasted with Kant's "I ought, therefore I can," Stern stresses the importance of the implication of " I can, therefore I ought," but he appears somewhat inappreciative of the confusion which that as a maxim might bring into human conduct. Enough has been said to indicate Stern's general position. He makes a valiant attempt to elaborate a metaphysic which shall represent a unity of a theory of being and a theory of value. But it must be said that, apart from intimating their common relation, to the person, he is no more successful in showing the nature of the unity of values than the philosophies of culture which he con- demns. His neglect of the side of the value-problem which may be called the evil, especially error, ugliness, and immorality, is a serious defect. ALBAN G. WIDGERY.</page></plain_text>
