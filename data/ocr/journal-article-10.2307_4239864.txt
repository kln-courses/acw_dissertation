Starmont House, 1986 [rpt. 1983 ed.]. 79pp. $7.95 (paper).-By the very fact that Twayne has issued a revised H.G. Wells, one is reminded of how much has happened in Wells studies since Richard Hauer Costa originally produced his survey in 1967; and, indeed, in the updated index, bibliography, and acknowledgments, Costa cites some 25 new books about Wells. Pity he does not make better use of them. He does remedy some of the holes in the 1967 text. The discussion of Wells and feminism has been expanded, and there is a head-on effort to gauge the Wellsian and Jamesian types of "central intelligence" by comparing them in Britling and The Ambassadors. But very little has been added or altered as regards the Wells of the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, where the survey was -and remains-the scantiest. What has not been remedied at all (indeed, has in some ways been exacerbated) is bad organization, with attendant repetitiousness, and factual unreliability. For present purposes, I shall consider mostly the revised text. Rather than assimilating the old text to the requirements of the new findings, Costa typically retains the major sections of the original nearly verbatim and then at remote and arbitrary junctures interpolates the results of recent criticism. In large part because of this untidy and repetitious procedure, the book has fattened by maybe 30%. For example, the discussion of Wells's early SF is barely altered (occupying chapter 3 in the 1967 edition and chapter 2 in 1985); but then eight chapters later, without warning, comes a new section, "The Science Fictionists: The Time Machine," which is subheaded disjunctively under "Suvin," "Parrinder," "Philmus," and "Huntington,"</page><page sequence="2">96 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 15 (1988) and which alludes to the chapter 2 discussion only in passing. The all-new chapter 8, "Wells and Science," is another unexpected add-in. It explicates the science con- nection in Wells's opus by reference to the recent critics, Roslynn Haynes and (again) John Huntington; but the eighth chapter (out of I 1) would be much too late for the basic question of Wells and science were it not that the subject has already been broached in the aforementioned chapter 2. This sort of postscriptum procedure makes the book a chore to read. Unreliability is a bad problem. The book being a frankly derivative summary survey of Wells and his critics, factual accuracy is particularly important. I made a partial check of quotations and quickly turned up over 100 errors in the quotations themselves, the page references, or the attributions, and the majority of them were carried from the first edition. Too many slips are symptomatic. A survey may be derivative, but it ought not to be erroneously derivative. That last sentence is Richard D. Mullen's from a 1967 review (in Riverside Quarterly) that decisively memorialized Costa's remarkable ignorance of the contents of The Holy Terror (taken as a sample of his general ignorance of the later Wells) and his evident erro- neous understanding of his second-hand source, whatever it was, which he had not acknowledged. Actually, the source tums out to be Antonina Vallentin (apparent from verbal echoes), and it is true that Costa condenses her remarks to the point of inanity. The stinger, though, is that the "revised" (1985) Holy Terror discussion reads exactly as before. After that nothing is surprising, but I shall add four other curious inaccuracies. The Philmus-Hughes bibliography of Wells's early science journalism is said to list over 200 items (p. 10), when in fact it lists fewer than 100; William Bellamy's Rieffian psychological analysis of Wells at the fin-de-siecle is said to account for the "exhilaration" of Wells's short stories (p. 31), when in fact Bellamy's analysis sets out to account for "images of malaise"; Huntington is said to chronicle all of Wells, "The whole performance" (p. 107), when in fact Huntington halts at about 1905-except for the elaboration of a single phrase that he borrows from The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind; and Philmus is said to have stated that the Time Traveller brings back a wilted flower "from the one hundred twenty-first century" (p. 146), when in fact Philmus mentioned that century in another connection, did not relate it to the wilted flower, and would have been about 690 millennia in error if he had. As a Starmont pamphlet, Robert Crossley's H.G. Wells surveys exclusively the SF, a much less ambitious undertaking than Costa's, which is further simplified by limiting discussion to Wells's five SF classics (The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, The First Men in the Moon) and a rather spotty run-down of the short stories. Granted these disclaimers, Crossley offers much in little. The core of individual readings of the SF, in the above order, is preceded by a sketch of Wells's life to age 30 and a concise account of Wells's development after 1900 as a movement from the "pure fantasy" of the SF to the "applied fantasy" of the action-oriented works that followed. So even though those works lie beyond Crossley's scope, he shows the SF as opening a path to them. The individual readings themselves are thematically unified in terms of con- tinuing religious, political, and social motifs; but, at the same time, Crossley's approach is at bottom literary and aesthetic, as indicated by his rarely equalled interest in Wells's characters-as-characters and his attention to Wells's use of lan- guage. The latter involves generous and often un-shopworn chunks of quotation. Also, Crossley's own style is fluent and strikes off teachable if sometimes glib crit- ical phrases. A few examples: as already noted, fantasy may by "applied" or "pure" (p. 13); Wells, with Samuel Johnson, would "regulate imagination by reality"</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS IN REVIEW 97 rather than, with Henry James, build "a house of fiction," because Wells's was "a documentary imagination" (pp. 16-17); the Time Traveller is in part "profoundly Morlockian" (p. 26), and in the cannibalism of his future, "politics shall become flesh" (p. 28); and so forth. Altogether, this is a fresh, readable guide to Wells's most famous SF, and, at the same time, it is knowledgeable, unobtrusively at home with the recent secondary literature (i.e., as of 1979, the date of composition; and the 10 pages of primary and secondary bibliographies, usefully classified and annotat- ed, have been brought up through 1984). Science is Crossley's blind spot-I think less from a humanistic or aesthetic than from a religious standpoint. He minimizes the science Wells knew by treating T.H. Huxley's influence as purely philosophical, as if Huxley never taught the dis- section of a rabbit, and by encapsulating all of Wells's science in the fact that "he left school with a mediocre record and got various undistinguished jobs teaching science to preadolescent boys" (p. 13), as if Wells had not later taken the B.Sc. with first-class honors in zoology, taught adults (one of whom he married), and written or collaborated on two biology texts. Then, turning to the fiction, Crossley tends to equate science with the pseudo-scientific patter that accompanies time travel, invisi- bility, or anti-gravity, and by dismissing the patter, to undercut the claims of science upon Wells's science fiction. In turn, the vacancy thus opened up tends to promote religious themes stepping in, not necessarily an implausible displacement: it is 15 years since the Mackenzies connected the evangelical Christianity of Wells's youth with the apocalyptic aspects of Darwin (especially Huxley's Darwin). Cross- ley's religious glossings make good (if only partial) sense. He notes Wells's fre- quent biblical language and comments on the creation scenes by Moreau and on the lunar surface, the transformation scenes in The War of the Worlds, and the first (Adamic) and last (contra-Adamic) men scattered through the SF. In a word, Crossley seems to miss the point that Wells uses the vistas opened by science to dwarf the "eternities" of religion and to create out of religious language and imagery an ironic comment on religious anthropomorphism. In spite of this caveat, Crossley's H.G. Wells excels as an introduction intended for a wide audience, including non-specialists of all sorts. David Y.
