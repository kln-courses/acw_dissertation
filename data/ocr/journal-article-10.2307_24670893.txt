Status quaestionis e nuove linee di ricerca (The present essay is a continuation of the earlier study published in Hen 28,2 [2006]: 140-159. It provides prelimi nary results of the edition of the Papyrus Gizeh [G; Codex Panopolitanus], which the two authors are preparing. It contains excerpta mostly from the Book of Watch ersers of 1 Enoch in Greek. The edition in process includes comparative material from Georgius Syncellus' Chronographiae, and the Aramaic fragments of4QEnoch [cf. Milik, 1976]. The authors suggest that a Greek 1 Enoch probably existed in early Christian times. G has the tendency of preserving the "mythological" color ing of the narrative. In his turn, Syncellus preserved fragmentary texts of a Greek 1 1 Enoch, which are less "mythological" and deserve to be taken into serious account. In fact, in some cases Syncellus is preferred when compared to G. How ever, both G and Sync, seem to derive from different Greek traditions. Two more preliminary studies are scheduled before the final edition: one will concentrate on the relation between G and Syncellus; the other will investigate on the proba ble connections between G and 4QEn); 50/3-4 (2008), 129-146 Ephraim Nissan, The Giving of the Law: Which Shape the Tables of the Law?
