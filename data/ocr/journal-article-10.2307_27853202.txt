<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fourth Dimension: Toward a Ge ometry of Higher Reality. Rudy Rucker. 228 pp. Houghton Mifflin, 1984. $17.95. In the first part of this book, which is addressed to an audience of intelligent nonmathematicians, Rucker attempts to convey the meaning of a fourth spatial dimension by drawing analogies be tween the embeddings of one-, two-, and three-dimensional objects in spaces of dimension three or less?embeddings which we can visualize?and embedd ings of three-dimensional objects in four-dimensional space, which we can not visualize. The analogies are often very clever anthropomorphic ones along the lines of Abbott's Flatland, and I feel they succeed in enabling the lay reader to develop an intuition for four-dimen sional objects. Rucker argues that additional dimen sions actually exist, and as partial evi dence he discusses physical models from general relativity: multiply-connected three-dimensional spaces, and the view of time as the fourth dimension. His analyses of the examples from general relativity are often technically incorrect. For instance, he claims that wormholes could be used as passages to other regions of space-time, but relativists have known for years that actual travel through a wormhole is impossible. He also claims that one could see the other universe connected by an Einstein-Rosen bridge, but this is also impossible. He concludes the book with the claim that the actual universe has not merely three or four dimensions, but is a Hilbert space of in finitely many dimensions, with parallel worlds. His arguments for this thesis are metaphysical; he surprisingly makes no reference to the many-worlds interpre tation of quantum mechanics, a theory which would physically justify both the Hilbert space and the parallel worlds. The lay reader who wishes to learn the higher-dimensional geometry of physics must look elsewhere.?Frank ]. Tipler, Mathematics and Physics, lutane Univer sity</page></plain_text>
