Adonis No species remains constant: that great renovater of matter Nature, endlessly fashions new forms from old : there 's nothing in the whole universe that perishes , believe me; rather it renews and varies its substance. What we describe as birth is no more than incipient change from a prior state, while dying is merely to quit it. Though the parts may be transported hither and thither, the sum of all matter is constant. Ovid Metamorphoses O Lady!

We have to consider, in this final chapter of our work, how the insightful claim of Claude Lévi-Strauss, to the effect that a myth is a link between nature and culture, has been applied to bridge the basic dichotomies between subject and object, between individual and the group, history, and transcendence.</page><page sequence="4">1 1 4 God as the Shadow of Man Our mythogene is supposed to create the mediational structures between these divergent dichotomies. In order to do this properly, we must examine carefully the nature of the barrier between the discordant elements of these dichotomies. Next, we must examine the composition, function, and dynamics of the mythogenic mediation between the dualities. Finally, we shall take stock of our accomplishments, if any, and look for new fields, adjacent to our present one, to plough. We envisage four major barriers between the developmental phases of man: the ontological barrier between being and nothingness, the existential barrier between pantheistic participation and the crystallization of the individual self, and the ethical barrier between normative non-responsibility and ethical culpability. Finally, there is the transition from1 life to death. Schematically these developmental phases, and the barriers dividing them, may be presented as shown in figure 3.1. The first barrier divides non-being and being. In Judaism, non-being (ain), is the potential of being. This stems from an interpretation by the Maggid of a verse in Job, which asks: 'But where shall wisdom be found?'1 in the affirmative rather than the interrogative form. The result is that 'from where?', (meayin) becomes 'from nothingness'. Hence, says the Maggid: 'This wisdom is within reach of the worthy yet in order to reach it, they have to think that they are dust... wisdom is nothingness.'2 Therefore, 'the purpose of man is to abolish... reality and to return to the mystical ayin (nothingness) which preceded Creation.'3 The ontological transition from non-being to being by birth is registered, as we have seen, by the neonate as a catastrophe, which has its mytho-empirical projection in the Kabbalist cosmic disaster of the breaking of the vessels. The existentialist counterpart of this catastrophe is the conception of birth by Heidegger as a Geworvenheit zum tod, a 'thrownness unto death'.

Here the passage is registered by the infant as an expulsion, which is mythologically projected as an ejection from paradise. Indeed, the arrow of time points in a one-way direction of developmental growth; the way back is barred by the cherubim brandishing their flaming swords in every direction, preventing the return to the Edenic bliss of early orality. The enormity of original sin relates to the attempt of Adam to know God, or rather be reunited with Him, since da ' at , knowledge, in Hebrew, is also union with the totality of pantheistic unity. This would have annihilated life, since creatures need their spatio-temporal boundaries in order to exist. Since the God of Genesis has created the world and its creatures as his magnum opus, therefore the annihilation of temporal existence and its reversal into the wholeness of pantheism is, indeed, a primal affront to the creator. We have dealt extensively in previous chapters with the normative barriers between the forgiveness of non-responsibility within the family fold and culpability outside it. The passage through of this normative barrier forced on us by our elders has been extensively dealt with by us while discussing the Isaac and Iphigenia syndromes. The last transition, that from life to death, is massively documented mytho-empirically. Ancient Egyptian culture is almost totally based on a preparation for death, i.e., the passage from the domain of Horus in the here-and-now to that of Osiris in the west where the sun sets and the dead go to rest. The domain of life is separated from the domain of death by seven gates guarded by ugly monsters. They have names such as 'He whose face is inverted', 'He who eats the corruption of his hinder parts', 'He who lives on snakes', and 'He who cuts them down'.4 The keeper of the door to the west, the domain of the dead, is Babai, alias 'He of sharp knife',5 which brings to mind the cherubim guarding the gate to Eden with a turning sword of fire. In order to pass through the gates to the domain of Osiris in the west, one has to recite spells, manipulate the guards, and</page><page sequence="6">1 1 6 God as the Shadow of Man flatter and placate them with offerings.6 Another way of convincing the gatekeepers to grant passage is to argue that one was sent as ambassador to Osiris by a god in the east, such as Re, Shu, or Tefnut;7 better still, the supplicant claims to have a theurgical mission of mending the blemished god. This reminds us of the soul of the worthy in the Kabbala, which mends the less than perfect god, but in ancient Egypt, it was concrete, like the restoring of a gouged eye of Horus, which made complete the red crown of the deity and 'caused the plume to grow into the shoulder of Osiris'.8 In Mesopotamia, we find the transition from the world of mortality to the immortal realm of the gods guarded by the mountain Mashu. 'Its upper parts touch the skies' foundation, below, their breasts reach Arallu. They guard its gate, scorpion-men whose aura is frightful, and whose glance is death. Their terrifying mantles of radiance drape the mountains. They guard the sun at dawn and dusk'. 9 In Greece, Cerberus, the three-headed dog with a pelt of snakes, guards the gates of Hades, the underworld and the domain of the dead. Only Hermes, the professional border smuggler, was crafty enough to deal with the horrid Cerberus and safely conduct the souls of the dead to their abode in the underworld. We shall now examine the barriers in the corresponding development, or rather formation, of energy-matter. Figure 3.2 shows the four phases of material existence that correspond to human development. I. Ontological Barrier Event Horizon Ain-singularity ; Big Bang I II. Existential Barrier Uncertainty Principle Quantum World III. Phenomenal Epistemic Barrier Perceived Object Classic World IV. Temporal Barrier Diachronic Entropy i Big Crunch Figure 3.2</page><page sequence="7">Epilogue and Overture 1 1 7 The ontological boundary of energy-matter is the event horizon, which is the boundary of a black hole. The singularity is situated within this region of super-gravity, from which even light cannot escape - hence, its blackness. The singularity is matter compressed into a region of zero volume, so that 'the density of matter and the curvature of space-time become infinite'. 10 Mytho-empirically, the ain-nothingness, was conceived by the striking imagery of the Kabbala as the potential of the singularity with an event horizon around it, the initiation of the tsimtsum (contraction) by means of the creation of a round space and a concentrated point within it.11 The potentiality of all the world's energy, as well as that of astral bodies, is envisaged by the contraction of infinity into a localized round space, tehiru , in which all the worlds have subsequently been created.12 Describing conception of contraction by the sixteenth-century Safed School of Lurianic Kabbala, Scholem says: If, therefore, the Midrash says that, originally, the world was to have been based on the quality of strict judgment, din, but that God, seeing that this was insufficient to guarantee its existence, added the quality of mercy, the Kabbalist who follows Luria interprets this saying as follows: The first act, the act of tsimtsum, in which God determines, and therefore limits, himself, is an act of din which reveals the roots of this quality in all that exists; these roots of divine judgment subsist in chaotic mixture with the residue of divine light which remained after the original retreat or withdrawal within the primary space of God's creation. Then a second ray of light out of the essence of en-sof brings order into chaos and sets the cosmic process in motion, by separating the hidden elements and moulding them into a new form. Throughout this process the two tendencies of perpetual ebb and flow - the Kabbalists speak of hithpashtuth, egression, and histalkuth, regression - continue to act and react upon each other. Just as the human organism exists through the double process of inhaling and exhaling and the one cannot be concéived without the other, so also the whole of creation constitutes a gigantic process of divine inhalation and exhalation. In the final resort, therefore, the root of all evil is already latent in the act of tsimtsum. 13 This is indeed a striking picture of the initial dialectics of separation (hithpashtuth) and participation (histalkuth) in forming both our initial symboloi structures as prime-movers, as well as the subsequent Promethean Holons. After the 'contraction' of pregnancy, conceived by the Kabbala as vile dinim (stern judgment), in contrast to the hessed (grace) of non-differentiated infinity, a major catastrophe occurred, which to our</page><page sequence="8">1 1 8 God as the Shadow of Man mind, is the Kabbalist mytho-empirical projection of birth. Indeed, Vital expressly says that the death of kings, which in Kabbalist imagery is synonymous with the breaking of the cosmic vessels, is not real death but a descent from a higher to a lower echelon 'like a woman giving birth who also emits refuse'.14 This conception of the breaking of the vessels as a mytho-empirical projection of birth is in line with some bio-psychological premises which envisage the experience of birth by the neonate as a catastrophe. In the first chapter of Salvation Through the Gutters,15 we showed that at birth the fetus is fully capable of registering the enormity of the shock of its expulsion from the womb, both bodily and mentally. In a publication on the psychology of childbirth, Leboyer describes the infernal experiences of the neonate during birth and just after it, thus: ...Hell exists and is white hot. It is not a fable. But we go through it at the beginning of our lives, not the end. Hell is what the child goes through to reach us. Its flames assail the child from every side; they burn its eyes, its skin, they sear its flesh; they devour. This fire is what the baby feels as the air rushes into the lungs. The air, which enters and sweeps through the trachea and expands the aveoli, is like the acid poured on a wound.16 The transition from the womb to the world is violent in all respects: the need to breathe instead of receiving oxygen directly from the bloodstream of the mother, the need to seek food and digest it, and the exposure to changing temperatures and hard objects instead of the constant warmth and cushioned, resilient walls in the womb. The expulsion from the womb is also accompanied by a period of varying intensity and length, of being squeezed and pushed into the rather narrow and inflexible birth canal which we mercifully do not remember, as a necessary defense against its intense bodily pains and psychic trauma, but is undoubtedly registered by our sub- or pre-conscious and projected, inter alia, as myths. The myth of the breaking of the vessels relates to the birth-giving mother and the ejection from the womb, whereas the myth of the scattering of the divine sparks, which in Lurianic Kabbala is a sequel to the breaking of the vessels, relates more directly to the neonate himself. The newborn feels himself as a precious particle of divinity, omnipresent and, hence, omnipotent, because at this stage of his life he cannot be aware of anything or anybody except himself. Yet, in his omnipresent egocentricity, he experiences a disastrous catapulting from blissful self-sufficiency into painful, troubled, and hostile surroundings which are not far removed from the mythical characteristics of hell.</page><page sequence="9">Epilogue and Overture 1 1 9 It is also in line with the anthropocentric structure of the Kabbala that whatever happens in the divine realm has an immediate bearing on the temporal world and the fate of man. Conversely, the theurgic conception of the Kabbala considers every human act to have an immediate effect on divinity. This makes for a symbiosis between God and man. The less than perfect Kabbalist God, who is subject to catastrophes he neither foresees nor controls, needs man to mend (kabbalist tikkun) the catastrophe of the breaking of the vessels. Furthermore, the nature of Lurianic Kabbala seems to be teleological; thus, it is less concerned with the catastrophic nature of the breaking of the vessels than with the fact that this cosmic catastrophe gives divinity a chance to cleanse itself of its polluted components and allows man to save himself while mending the blemished divinity. It should be stressed, however, that Ibn Tabul, the second major disciple of Rabbi Isaac Luria, does not see the breaking of the vessels as a cosmic catastrophe unforeseen by divinity, but rather as an operation planned by God to cleanse Himself of dinim, the sinister elements within the infrastructure of divinity. After this planned breaking of the vessels, the theurgic mending (tikkun) by man will clean divinity of its vile residues. Again, a teleological theodicy of a catastrophe within divinity is concomitant with a mytho-empirical projection of the thrownness of man into temporality, because it gives divinity the opportunity to cleanse itself and man the opportunity to save himself. We hold that the Kabbalist myth of the breaking of the vessels is also a projection of the birth of energy by the Big Bang - although its mytho-empirical projection is somewhat different and comes from another mythological layer than the breaking of the vessels, which relates to human birth. The Big Bang is described by Steven Weinberg as follows: In the beginning there was an explosion. Not an explosion like those familiar on earth, starting from a definite center and spreading out to engulf more and more of the circumambient air, but an explosion which occurred simultaneously everywhere, filling all space from the beginning, with every particle of matter rushing apart from every other particle. 'All space' in this context may mean either all of an infinite universe, or all of a finite universe which curves back on itself like the surface of a sphere. Neither possibility is easy to comprehend, but this will not get in our way; it matters hardly at all in the early universe whether space is finite or infinite. At about one-hundredth of a second, the earliest time about which we can speak with any confidence, the temperature of the universe was about a hundred thousand million (1011) degrees centigrade. This is much hotter than in the center of even the hottest star, so hot, in fact, that none of the components</page><page sequence="10">1 20 God as the Shadow of Man of ordinary matter, molecules, or atoms, or even the nuclei of atoms, could have held together. Instead the matter rushing apart in this explosion consisted of various types of the so-called elementary particles, which are the subject of modern high-energy nuclear physics.17 We have seen that the Kabbalist myth of the breaking of the vessels is projected in a dual manner. One mythical layer, expounded by Vital, relates this cosmic catastrophe to a chance and, hence, to an uncontrolled, explosion more suitable for the projection of the Big Bang, whereas the other mythological layer expounded by Ibn Tabul, conceives the breaking of the vessels as an indeterministic self-cleansing act which is more suitable to the value-laden mytho-empiricism of human birth. Moving further with the dynamics of human development and to the second existential barrier, which separates the quantum world from the classic one, we shall compare it to the coagulation of the separate human self out of the pantheistic mass of early orality and to the analogous creation of the Eigenstate of the separate particle out of the nondescript superposed energy. The mytho-empirical projection of these analogous processes is the expulsion from paradise and the fall from grace. After original sin, God condemned man to a cursed land in which he would live in sorrow all his temporal life. Psychologically, the pantheistic neonate learns through deprivational-interaction with his surroundings and, especially, with his mother or her surrogate who cannot fulfill all his wishes immediately and automatically as in the womb that he is not with everything, but against everything. The moment he becomes embodied in the scar-tissue of his delimiting individual ego boundary, his pantheistic participant togetherness gives way to the loneliness and the encapsulated existence of the human individualized separatum. This separation, the existential coagulation of the individual self, is also perceived by the organism as a catastrophe and projected onto mythology as the ejection from paradise following the original sin, which according to the Kabbala disrupted the equilibrium of all the worlds, both divine and temporal. The formation of the separate self, which according to our model occurs in the middle of the oral phase of development and marks the division between early and later orality, is not instantaneous but gradual. It is a transformation along a continuum, from a sense of partaking in a totality, to a feeling of séparant individuation. Mytho-empirically, this coagulation of the separate self is envisioned by the Kabbala as a double process of Neoplatonic embodiment, from infinite divine light to the profanity of the body, coupled with a transition from grace (hessed) to the harshness of temporal stern judgment. This in our model is the mytho-empirical</page><page sequence="11">Epilogue and Overture 1 2 1 transition from the participant pantheism of early orality to the séparant individuality of later orality. Before the realization of creation and man within it, the light of infinity was boundless, eternal, imperceptible, and non-differentiated.18 The motivation of emanating infinity in forming separate entities was to be able to confer grace onto them, because within the unity of infinity there can be no giving and no receiving.19 Yet this divine emanation and formation of individual beings was also motivated by a desire to rule and dominate.20 This might well be the mytho-empirical projection of the alternation at the oral stage between the graceful, nourishing good mother and the harsh bad mother withholding nourishment and care. The embodied émanant matter are considered by the Kabbala as profane shells.21 Moreover, according to Ibn Tabul, the differentiation of the emanent matter is effected by its swallowing of harsh dinim.22 This alludes to the importance of the oral introjection of emanation in Lurianic Kabbala. It is stated expressly by Ibn Tabul23 when he divides the suckling period of 24 months into three phases of 8 months each. Every life form and object in creation, as well as in divinity, is composed, according to the Kabbala, from endless combinations and permutations of ten rungs: keter , crown, which is part of divine infinity and has not emanated from it and is, thus, an emanating entity; chochma , wisdom, an archetype of divine masculinity; bina, intelligence or maternal divinity; hessed, grace or the goodness of God; gevura , signifying stern judgment or the sinister powers of divinity; tiferei , splendor; netzah , eternity; hod, awe; yesod, foundation, standing for the masculine components of the émanants, and malchut, kingdom or the feminine aspect of creation. Each rung may be likened to a holon, as conceptualized by the late Arthur Koestler to designate Janus-faced entities within a hierarchy.24 Or better still, the holographic images of laser-based photography which are composed of endless combinations of the same images. As for the formation of particles out of superposed energy, the mytho-empiricism of Lurianic Kabbala has the straight light stemming from the godhead as grace. Taking into account the participant bias of the Kabbala, this would stand for non-differentiated superposed energy. Then there is the refracting light, which has already interacted with émanant entities, and, thus, accordingly the Kabbala' s participant bias, is less sacred and is already afflicted with stern judgment, which for the Kabbala represents vileness. The straight light of grace and the refracted light of stern judgment, which to us represent the participant and séparant vectors within the connecting structure, then interact dialectically, in a process described by the Kabbala as 'blows' and 'thuds'. Out of their skirmishes the reshimu the coagulated particles of light are formed,25 which due to</page><page sequence="12">1 22 God as the Shadow of Man the Neoplatonic participant bias of the Kabbala are considered as sinister and vile. We have here the mytho-empirical projection of the coagulation of the separate human self out of pantheistic early orality, but also some layers of mythology projecting the encasement of particles into shells. This brings to the fore Penrose's quantum gravity theory which we have mentioned earlier and which envisages a general relativity dynamic which effects a space-time curvature around superposed energy to form an Eigenstate of a particle.26 Also, the dual guardians, the 'cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life' (Genesis 3:24), might well be the projection of Heisenberg' s uncertainty barrier preventing both position and momentum of a particle or similar pairs of variables from being measured out of the quantum world boundaries. This brings us to one of the most important components of our model, namely, the barrier which exists between the quantum and the classical worlds. At later orality a separate self has already emerged. A fixation on the early-oral pantheistic stage of development would result in a participant skewed personality longing to revert back to nothingness whereas a later oral fixation would effect a separantly skewed personality. The crucial point, however, is that a barrier separates a pantheistic totality from a separate individual. This barrier is necessary for the evolution of creatures. It is necessary for the formation of a feeling of solitude, of a lack and a longing for communication and dialogue. Finally, this barrier is indispensable for creativity and revelation. Consequently, the evolution of man as the anthropic mediator between consciousness and matter is dependent on the barrier forming around the individual. When the separate anthropos longs to reach the other life forms and objects, he becomes a revelatory Tantalus, a creative Sisyphus, and a meta-connecting Prometheus. The analogous barrier in quantum mechanics cuts off the superposed energy from the classic level. Many problems in quantum mechanics stem from the inability of its exponents to decide where the superposition ends, and where to collapse the wave function. Where should we place the quantum barrier: in the observer's brain as not dismissed out of hand by Von Neuman or in the measurement instrument. We hold that the barrier lies with the measuring instrument. Once a particle has been detected on the classic level by the measuring instrument, the superposition ends, and the barrier between the superposed quantum world and the classic world has been established. Passing over to the third barrier dividing the perceivable object from the non-perceivable particles, we shall compare it to that normative</page><page sequence="13">Epilogue and Overture 1 23 barrier dividing the individual from the social self. We have mentioned the processes of the formation of the social self, the rites of passage from adolescence to adulthood, and the painful expulsion from the cushioning family fold to the harsh and cruel interaction with the others as hell, to borrow Sartre's dramatic metaphor again. These dynamics of social separation imbue man with normativeness and, thus, make him capable of endowing meaning, values, and norms to the life forms and objects in his surroundings. The strong nuclear force binds the quarks into protons and neutrons, and these into the nucleus of the atom. The strong nuclear force is short-ranged and strong enough to overcome the mutually repellent, positive charge of the protons. It is mediated by the spin 1 virtual gluons. The weak nuclear force has the opposite effect to that of the strong force. It disintegrates or dissolves fermion matter-building particles of spin 1/2 by radio-activity. The weak force is mediated by virtual vector bosons. TTie electro-magnetic force holds together the atom in a system-in-balance. The negatively charged electrons are attracted by positively charged protons. The electro-magnetic force is mediated by spin 1 virtual photons. A feature of this force which is most interesting to our present context is that the negative charge of the electron is mediated by a virtual cloud forming a field where vectors point inwards. In contrast, the vectors of the field surrounding the positively charged protons point outwards. The pointing outwards is a symbolic giving whereas the pointing inwards is a symbolic taking. If we compare this dynamic with the mytho-empirical Kabbalist imagery, then grace is participant giving whereas stern judgment is séparant taking. To come back to our personality model, we should recall that the core personality is kept in a system-in-balance by the dynamics of the participant vector longing to revert back to the totality of unity of the pure ani-consciousness and the séparant vector aiming to swallow the object and dominate it. It should be pointed out that the four-fold division of the forces of nature (strong, weak, electro-magnetic, and gravity) is an artificial construct; except for the elusiveness of gravity, some successful attempts have been made to unify these forces. Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the weak and electro-magnetic forces. The grand-unified (gauge) theories (GUTS) integrated the strong nuclear force with electro-weak interactions, while Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking have tried, not altogether successfully, to co-opt the gravitational force to this interaction. Still, if we accept Penrose's quantum gravity theory, the collapse of the j amplitudes fonction, which is a participant superposed state, and the creation of a particle Eigenstate, which is a séparant</page><page sequence="14">1 24 God as the Shadow of Man concretization of matter, is effected by a space-time quantum gravity curvature.27 On the macro level, the séparant gravitational force mediated by the virtual graviton, which is responsible for the attraction of astral bodies, is countered by the participant centrifugal force. Still, even though the forces of nature have more séparant and more participant aspects, all of them would be far removed on the séparant pole of the participant-separant continuum in comparison to the rather chaotic participant force of entropy, which would be farther on the participant pole of the continuum. The third epistemic barrier divides atoms, which are invisible to the human eye, from perceptible objects composed of masses of matter and is analogous to the barrier between individuals and human groups and aggregates. We have also described earlier the séparant least interest principle, which prevents participation, since the reversal back to unity means the end of life. In energy-matter, Pauli' s exclusion principle fulfills a similar function, since the participant cohabitation of spin 1/2 fermions would be the end of energy-matter. We have also mentioned that, mytho-empirically, this proscription against fulfilled participation is presented in the myth of original sin, where knowledge stands for the reversal to unity. The proscription of participant reversal in time is projected by the myth of Lot's wife, who was punished by being paralyzed into immobility, and the mytho-empirical proscription against the unification of language is presented by the myth of the Tower of Babel. The séparant creator, the God of Genesis, protects his cosmos and the plurality of life forms and objects by the proscription of the contraction of space, the annihilation of temporal sequences, and the abrogation of the plurality of objects, representing a diversity of symboloi structures which secure the plurality and diversity of creation. We have also presented the need for a system-in-balance, the disruption of which destroys creatures and objects. And yet the innovative creators do commit the hiibris of innovation and, hence, disrupt the system-in-balance and rock the boat of structural stability. They pay dearly for it: a Van Gogh, a Galileo, and a Giordano Bruno are martyred for their creative innovations, and Prometheus their mytho-empirical predecessor is chained to a rock. Their creativity is, thus, punished normatively by their sacrificial martyrdom, which is, thereby, infused with meanings, values, and norms. The general theory of relativity tells us that gravity is responsible for the curvature of space, whereas entropy, as expressed by the second law of thermodynamics, decrees that in any closed system order tends to decrease and organization to disintegrate. Entropy, thus, indicates the arrow of time. The wrinkles in my face and the brown spots on my hands</page><page sequence="15">Epilogue and Overture 1 25 indicate to everybody, especially to myself, that I am over sixty and that I have a great future in my past. The system-in-balance between gravity and entropy indicates the integrated equilibrium between space and time. Space-time entails also a system-in-balance between the participant leveling of entropy and the séparant encurving embodying and enclosing dynamism of gravity. Penrose describes how the geodetic lines of the shortest routes, that of a positively curved surface would converge, whereas the geodetics on a negatively curved surface would diverge. Says he: Thus, our space-time, indeed, seems to possess a curvature analogous to that of our two surfaces, but more complicated because of the higher dimensionality, and mixtures of both positive and negative curvatures are involved for different displacements. With positive curvature the geodetic converge, whereas with negative curvature they diverge. This shows how the concept of curvature for space-time can be used to describe the action of gravitational fields.28 Figure 3.3 Geodetic lines on a curved surface29 This gives us a clue as to how gravity, effecting an elaborate process of space curvature, encases space around a symbolon structure in the process of creating a Promethean holon. The curvature of space through gravity as expounded by general relativity, thus, supplements the dynamics of special relativity which does not let matter escape from space by the limit of the velocity of light. Creatures and objects are thus encased within space-time as their viable context. Biologically, creatures can only exist within space-time. We have seen that Hawkings' two dimensional dog would not be able to retain anything in his two dimensional digestive tract, and that entropy and, hence, time, are of the essence in the developmental sequences of life. Space-time engulfs objects and life forms like the water in an aquarium, constitutes the essential life medium</page><page sequence="16">126 God as the Shadow of Man of goldfish, to utilize a crude metaphor. Entropy is a dynamic process, and so is time. Hence, the developmental transition from the Big Bang to the big crunch, from an ain singularity back to an ain singularity may be described, inter alia, by the thermodynamics of high and low entropy. The sense of time is also acquired through the developmental process of aging. The sense of the passage of time is acquired through our exterioceptors' and interioceptors' perception of our entropie bodily changes which could be reduced to energy-matter dynamics. The ani-consciousness is not subject to entropy and is, therefore, timeless. If we possess the right tools of introspection or mediation, we could sense that our ani-consciousness is as young or old now as it was when we were teenagers, adolescents, or infants. The ani-consciousness does not age because it is not subject to the developmental processes of thermodynamics generating the arrow of time. Finally, we have to deal with the fourth temporal barrier dividing the decay, disintegration, and death of matter leading to another cycle, da capo, of life and death of matter, similar in a metaphoric sense to the growth, decline, death, and resurrection of life forms. In chapter one, we have seen how the interaction between the participant and séparant personality core vectors, which constitutes the Tantalus Ratio (TR) is the prime mover of human personality. By analogy, we have seen that the interaction between the canned ani-consciousness and superposed energy constitutes the prime mover and dynamic contents of the structure of the created particle. We hold that the human TR (and that of other life-forms) and the prime movers of artifacts and objects are structurally and dynamically similar and, hence, comparable to one another, except for the one major difference that the ani-consciousness of life-forms is indeterministic, whereas the 'canned' consciousness of artifacts and life forms is algorithmically deterministic. The analogic examination of the prime movers of objects and life forms is the subject of our present section. We shall deal, for didactic purposes, with these dualistic interactions out of their context because, in reality, they interact in endless holonic combinations and permutations both in life forms and objects. We have already mentioned the dualities of the basic forces of energy-matter and their comparability with the dual forces fueling human beings and life forms, but for clarity's sake we shall present the following two continua, the first relating to energy-matter, and the second relating to man as the anthropic connecting agent.</page><page sequence="17">Epilogue and Overture 1 27 Quantum Atoms Macro world world strong nuclear force negative charge gravity séparant electro-magnetism ^ - participant weak nuclear positive charge entropy force Figure 3.4 The Continuum of Energy-Matter The quantum world contains the duality of the séparant strong nuclear force binding and encasing the nucleus of the atom, whereas the weak nuclear force participantly decays particles by radioactivity.

The analogy here to the human individual is in the anthropic continuum, whose personality is held in balance by the interaction of the participant ani component of the self with its séparant atzmi component. Both the atom and the human individual (or for that matter other life forms) constitute the connecting agents between the amorphic non-differentiated stage of their development and matter and human aggregates respectively. On the macro level, séparant gravity delimits and encases matter, whereas entropy diffuses and disperses it. With human aggregates, the analogy is to the dialectics between Sisyphean and Tantalic cultural patterns to be at</page><page sequence="18">1 28 God as the Shadow of Man the basis of the developmental fluctuations of cultures.30 We propose now to examine at greater length some of the analogies between the anthropic and the energy-matter continuums. The most basic analogy lies in the fact that the creation of energy-matter was made possible through the disintegration of uniformities into imperfections and the breaking of symmetries into asymmetries. We have already mentioned Steven Weinberg's 'The First Three Minutes'31, in which he describes the breaking of uniformities into diversities immediately after the Big Bang. Furthermore, a most lucid and concise description of this process is provided by Heinz Pagels: If we go back to the beginning of time, to the first moments of creation, the energy of the primordial fireball was so high that the four interactions were unified as one highly symmetrical interaction. As this fireball of swirling quarks, colored gluons, electrons, and photons expanded, the universe cooled and the perfect symmetry began to break. First, gravity was distinguished from the other interactions, and then the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions became apparent as they froze out of the cooling universe manifesting symmetry breaking. Exotic quanta like charmed particles decayed away, and soon mostly protons, neutrons, electrons, photons, and neutrinos were all that was left. After still further cooling, atoms could form and condense into stars, galaxies develop and planets emerge. As the surface temperatures of some planets dropped, complex molecules began to form the building blocks for life. Even in the evolution of life we see this process of symmetry breaking at work as organisms generally evolved from simple to more complex ones. Human societies, too, seem to become more complex as they develop. The universe from its very beginning to the present may be viewed as a hierarchy of successively broken symmetries - a transition from a simple perfect symmetry at the beginning of time to the complex patterns of broken symmetries we see today. At those immense energies at the beginning of time, life could not exist. Although interactions were unified and perfectly symmetrical, it was a sterile world. The universe had to cool and the perfect symmetries break before the complex interactions that gave rise to life could exist. Our world manifests a broken or imperfect symmetry. But out of that imperfection arose the possibility of life.32 Thus disruption, diffusion, and discrepancy mark the creation of energy-matter. Perfection and symmetry mark the potentiality of the singularity, which is the nothingness of the ain. The analogy to our anthropic continuum is the basic lack, the inability to achieve perfection which characterizes our core-vectors and which constitutes their prime</page><page sequence="19">Epilogue and Overture 1 29 movers. Both our Tantalic and Sisyphean vectors, as metaphorized by their mythological projections, are characterized by their inability to fulfill their aims. Hence, their unquenchable quests and unrequitable longings constitute their ontological fuel. The basic asymmetry of the physical forces constitutes their prime mover because their teleological aim is to revert back to the unity of the singularity and to the potential equilibrium of the nothingness of the ain. Although the séparant and participant forces function through diametrically opposed dynamics (telos), their aim (telos) is to revert to the potential of unity. This is the basic premise underlying the dynamics of our personality core-vectors. The séparant vector aims to close the rift between the object and itself by swallowing it and achieving unity by incorporating the object or life form into itself. This goal, however, is not achievable. No power politics, manipulations, or creative molding can gain for the séparant vector absolute dominion over the object life form. These attempts at dominion and creative efforts are projected as séparant mythologies, and recharging the batteries of our séparant core-vectors refueling them for further attempts at dominating the object and creating more art and artifacts. The unachievable goals of the séparant core-vectors are projected as deities, perfections unallowable to mortals. These are, inter alia, the Greek gods and the séparant components of a creator God, like the deity of the first chapters of Genesis. The participant core-vector, on the other hand, aims to achieve primeval unity by melting back into the object-life form. This goal is again unachievable, although revelatory and mystical experiences may give a momentary impression that it is possible. Hence, the non-fulfillment is projected as a myth of longing to fuel the participant core vector whereas the unachievable goals are projected onto religion as the abstract, unitary, and synchronizing God of Exodus ever immutable ehyeh asher ehyeh, I am that I am, in a continuous present. We have shown earlier that the TR, the contents of the symbolon structure which in its turn generates the Promethean holon, is indeed fueled and recharged by the mythologems projected by the experience of the séparant vector and the unrequited longing of the participant core- vector. Coming back to the quantum world, we have the strong nuclear force which binds together the particles that constitute the nucleus of the atom, e.g., protons and neutrons and are denoted as hadrons . However, a great proliferation of particles were discovered in the atom nucleus. The basic unit of matter within the hadron was named a quark, after a line from Joyce's Finnegan's Wake by the literate Murray Gellmann. These quarks were bound together by the séparant strong force in a remarkable way which not only overcomes the mutual repulsion of the positively charged</page><page sequence="20">1 30 God as the Shadow of Man protons, but also confines the quarks in their prison bags with such strength that it is impossible to extract and isolate a single quark from the strong nuclear forces' grip. Moreover, the quarks within the hadron bag hardly feel the strong forces' push or pull. Only when the quarks try to escape from their demiurgical prison bag or, rather, straight jacket do they feel the confining potency of the strong force. A similarity may be noted here with the effects of fast velocities on space as decreed by special relativity. Low velocities have a negligible special-relativistic effect on space-time. However, if an object approaches the speed of light, its time, for an observer, slows down, and its size flattens. As the speed of light would seem to be the archonic guardian of objects and life forms within spàce-time, so the strong force is apparently the demiurgical guard of the quarks within their hadronic prison. The quarks, which are also denoted by color (another measure of distinctness), are bound by gluons, which are also colored. These colored gluons interact not only with the quarks within the hadron bags, but also with themselves. This multiphasic hadronic interaction creates a strong force indeed. However, this very remarkable séparant harnessing of energy-matter is far from the omnipotence which it seemingly aims to achieve. Beta-decay effected by the weak nuclear force causes the disintegration of a neutron into an electron which leaves the nucleus, while a stable proton remains within the hadronic core. On the quark level, the disintegration of a hadron like a neutron is mediated by the massive vector bosons (W+W'Z0) which are the carriers of the weak nuclear force. The flavor of quarks - a differentiating measure coined seemingly in a moment of a poetic visitation or a culinary craving - may be 'up', 'down', and 'strange'. The weak force interacting with a quark may effect, for instance, a transformation from a down flavor to an up flavor causing an emission of a W vector boson which disintegrates into an electron which leaves the nucleus as an anti-neutrino. However, even the proton, the most common and most stable particle in the hadronic nucleus, is liable to disintegrate in a period of about 1028 times the age of our cosmos. Well time is an attribute of the anthropic agent interacting with the ani-consciousness and energy-matter. This is not the Kantean temporal filter in our minds, it is rather a quality of our conception of the anthropic principle as mediating between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter as a meta-symbolon structure. For the ahistorical ani-consciousness time does not exist, and, for the demiurgical energy-matter, time is meaningless. Both have eternity. What then is a mere ten billion billion billion years in which a proton may decay in the face of eternity?</page><page sequence="21">Epilogue and Overture 1 3 1 The temporal proviso is important because on the scale of eternity all our universe will ultimately be sucked back by the big crunch into an ain singularity, which will explode again into a Big Bang to collapse again into a black hole, da capo ad infinitum. These are the dynamics of existence observable both in the cosmological dimensions of energy-matter and in human societies. They are projected onto mythology as the cycles of creation and destruction of worlds and the death and resurrection of gods representing both energy-matter and life forms. If we come back to the weak interaction, it can affect the unstable baryons (the heavy ones stemming from the Greek ßapus within the atomic nucleus), but does not influence the (historically) stable proton, whose life expectancy, we have seen to be about 1028 years. It also affects the leptons (Greek Xsrcras = light) orbiting the nucleus, but not the electron itself, whose life expectancy is about 1021 years. Since electrons and protons are the main building blocks of the atom, the decaying effects of the weak force are partial indeed. Hence, the teleological goals of the séparant strong force and the participant weak force are partially achieved and partially frustrated, like the aims of the human participant and séparant core vectors. The aims of these forces, viewed as absolutes, are not achievable, analogous to the goals of the human core-vectors as projected by the meta-myths of Sisyphus and Tantalus. Turning to the atom, the basic structural unit of matter, we see its dynamic as a system-in-balance between forces: the positively charged electro-magnetic nucleus is balanced by the negatively charged leptons. Hence, the total charge of the atom is 0. However, what exactly is meant by a negative or positive charge? These are, of course, arbitrary notations, but represent an intrinsic variance. The positive charge lacks energy quanta, because it has given them out, whereas the negative charge has been taking in quanta. The negatively charged electron, thus, has an accompanying field with vectors pointing inwards, whereas the field accompanying the positively charged proton has vectors pointing outwards. The séparant negative charge swallows or takes, whereas the participant positive charge is the givers. This is in line with our conceptualization of the dual structure of objects and life-forms and their interactional dynamics. On the bio-psychological level, we have the female separantly absorbing and holding within her womb, whereas the male gives out participantly, injecting semen into the female. In chapter one, we have shown how the personality core- vectors are characterized by the séparant vector aiming to incorporate, to swallow, whereas the participant vector</page><page sequence="22">1 32 God as the Shadow of Man aims to melt into, to give of itself, so to speak, to, the object life form. On the social level, we have recently completed a volume-length analysis of separant-Sisyphean carnivorous, aggressively martial cultures interacting with participant Tantalic self-effacing and normatively-sacrificial cultures.33 We, thus, have an analogy between the séparant-participant dynamics of the electro-magnetic force and the similar dual forces operating on the three bio-psycho-social levels of human and other life forms. On the mytho-empirical level, we have the Kabbalist hessed, which is a participant radiation, a giving out of grace, whereas din is an attribute of the séparant depriver-taker. This analogy is replete with the attraction of non-likes and the repelling of likes, as phrased by Coulomb's law regarding electro-magnetic forces. This law states that, unlike electric charges, opposite magnetic poles will attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and proportional to the product of their force - producing electric charges or magnetic pole strengths. This is a special case of what we have denoted as the least interest principle. A séparant personality type is repelled by another séparant type, likewise a participant type34 is repelled by another participant, whereas a séparant type is attracted to a participant type, and vice- versa. However, the rule against the fulfillment of the vector goals puts a veto on a relationship that has become too close - love affairs peter out, friendships sour, and an I-thou dialogue deteriorates into an I-it petrification. We are not meant to reach a dialogical union for more than a limited, often a pitifully short, time. On the quantum level, Pauli's exclusion principle guards against too close a rapprochement between fermions. A too close human relationship gives rise to frictions which destroy the love, friendship, or dialogue, and, similarly, an overcrowding of fermions would play havoc with the structure of matter. On a higher level of abstraction, this injunction against a union or too close a proximity is a variation on the theme of original sin. We are not supposed to revert back to unity as craved and longed-for by our core-vectors. For life and matter to continue to exist, the distinctness of the atoms and the separate individuality of humans and life forms must be preserved - the alternative is disintegration, chaos, and death. Finally, we propose to deal with gravity and entropy on the macro level. Due to its relative weakness, the impact of gravity on the quantum and nuclear levels is limited. Its most spectacular impact is in astrophysics and cosmology, as demonstrated by Einstein's general theory of relativity and more recently by Hawking' s and Penrose's insights into the Big Bang and big crunch. We have already mentioned that, as early as 1928, Chadrasekhar hypothesized that a cold star of more than 1.5 times the mass of the sun would possess a gravity more powerful than the</page><page sequence="23">Epilogue and Overture 1 33 opposing Pauli' s exclusion principle - hence, the star will collapse. Hawking demonstrated that this collapse would end up in a black hole in the center of which would be the singularity potential (our ain) surrounded by the event horizon which does not let most (not all) energy escape from the black hole.35 The Sisyphean cycles of astral bodies, or for that matter of the universe itself as ordained by séparant gravity, means that after a cooling of the gas explosively expanded by the Big Bang, some gravitational effects would produce irregularities in the expansion which would then effect a coagulation of astral bodies.36 In time, as measured astronomically by thousands of millions of years, stars expand to red giants with a white dwarf in their center acquiring ever-larger density while sucking up the red stars' energy-matter. The white dwarf might cool and become a black dwarf - astral debris cruising insignificantly and invisibly in space. When the gravitational pressure is greater than the exclusion principle, a violent nuclear explosion could turn the white dwarf into a super nova. The explosion affects only the outer core, while the inner core still contracts and becomes a neutron star. The gravitational density of this mighty dwarf is immense. When it reaches the Landau-Oppenheimer-Volkov limit (2.5 Mo) and when the exclusion principle as applied to neutrons does not hold, the star collapses or, rather, is sucked into a black hole.37 As the transition from the Big Bang to the big crunch is holonic, it applies both to individual astral bodies and to the meta-cosmogonical processes. The rather rugged representation of these cosmogonie transitions is presented by Penrose as shown in figure 3.6: Figure 3.638 The Sisyphean cyclic dimension of gravity is inherent in the fact that black holes re-explode into a Big Bang with the force of millions of H</page><page sequence="24">1 34 God as the Shadow of Man bombs. The séparant spiral cycles of gravity may, therefore, be presented as a curved continuum as shown in figure 3.7. This curved continuum shows us at the meeting point of the edges what we have described anecdotally in the previous pages, namely, that séparant gravity not only does not achieve its goal of an absolute mastery over energy-matter, but is self-defeating. After it has overcome its most potent adversary, i.e., Pauli's exclusion principle, and presumably achieved mastery over its entrapped energy-matter, its trophy collapses into the nothingness (ain) of a point-singularity within a black hole. This is presented in the upper left point of the continuum where the séparant cycle of gravity starts another spiral curve from the point-potential of a singularity. When we turn to entropy, on the participant extreme pole of our continuum, we may observe a similar self-defeating cycle. The high entropy radiation of the sun provides the means for photosynthesis, which sustains the flora that further sustains the fauna. The high entropie disintegration of life-forms and minerals provides the nourishment for flora which are consumed by fauna. The high entropy emanation of oxygen by plants allows fauna to breathe. The plant absorbs the carbon dioxide which is noxious to fauna, releases the oxygen, and ingests the carbon. Fauna then reverse this process into a recombination of carbon and oxygen da capo. This participant cycle of entropy is Tantalic because it is similarly self-defeating. A high-entropy participant process at the left-hand side of our continuum would be instrumental in producing a highly structured organism, whose entropie aging starts from the moment of its creation. séparant ^ secaral participât ^ gravity J ertrag ' ^ 1 11 patanal Figure 3.7 The analogy with human aggregates has been suggested by us in our recent study of the psycho-history of the Holocaust. In this study, we have shown that some participant experiences may push a Sisyphean social character to be even more aggressively Sisyphean. Likewise, extreme participant experiences of a Tantalic social character would effect a</page><page sequence="25">Epilogue and Overture 1 3 5 movement across the social character continuum towards a more séparant reaction. Thus, the defeat of the Germans in the First World War - a participant experience - served as a dialectical lever for the ascent of the Nazis to power, whereas the Holocaust, a colossal participant experience, was instrumental in the creation of the State of Israel, which is quite power-oriented: as Golda Meir said, 'I shall never forgive the Arabs that out of the People of the Book (participants) they helped turn the Jews into arms merchants' (séparants). This is not the place to go into these dialectics of the social characters, and interested readers are referred to our Valhalla , Calvary, and Auschwitz?9 Similar transformations on the social-aggregate level are taking place right now in Eastern Europe, but their examination likewise lies outside the scope of the present work. To summarize our deliberations in this section, comparing the forces of nature and the forces that move man, the teleological aims of both the forces of nature and the core-vectors thereof are unattained and unachievable. This makes them not only the prime movers of man (and all life forms) and the fueling ding-an-sich of energy-matter, but also eternal. Energy-matter moves from the Big Bang to the big crunch, from singularity to singularity ad infinitum. Likewise, man is moved by Sisyphean cycles, never achieving his original ends, but undergoing creative experiences in the process which creates the séparant myths that fuel his core-vectors da capo. Man's Tantalic aims are also not fulfillable by definition; but revelatory experiences recharge our participant core-vectors and feed our religions with Tantalic myths of longing. As our ani-consciousness is eternal, only our bodies rot away. We are endlessly reincarnated like Varuna, Mithra, Ahaswer, and the Flying Dutchman. Another important analogy can be made between man's wish to revert back to earlier developmental phases, even ultimately to the non-being of unity, and the apparent striving of energy-matter, which is also ever-frustrated, to regain the perfect symmetry40 at the beginning of time. With complete uniformity, there are no structures; with complete smoothness there is no differentiation. With no comparative information, there is a homogenous nothing. We have described in chapter one how the human being continuously wishes to revert back to earlier developmental phases: from the burdens of normative responsibility to the relative impunity of the family fold; from the loneliness of individuality to the pantheistic togetherness of early orality; from the deprivational interaction of being to the bliss of non-being in utero. The reversal to earlier developmental phases are, of course, impossible, hence, sublimatory processes might channel the participant longings and</page><page sequence="26">136 God as the Shadow of Man séparant quests into creative and revelatory channels. For energy-matter, the initial perfect symmetry and the subsequent differentiation into forces and matter may be schematically presented as follows (figure 3.8): Time that has passed Temperature of the since the Big Bang Present universe -jio 2.7 k seconds ļsj Uc Iear Electro- B Weak force Gravity force magnetic ■ force I 12 -4 I H) k 10 seconds I i5 -io i-^ * 10 k io seconds * Strong force ' ^ seconds j -43 72 1 (j -43 seconds ^ 1_0 k Figure 3.8 By analogy with the human core-vector's quest to revert back to earlier developmental phases, we hypothesize a quest of energy-matter to revert back to the perfect symmetry at the beginning of time. Short of achieving this ultimate goal, energy-matter sublimates by ever striving to achieve symmetry after it has been spontaneously or purposely broken. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that some of the most revolutionary theories in modern physics are related to a mathematical restructuring of broken symmetries. These gauge symmetry transformations are responsible for the unification of electro-magnetism and the weak force noted by Weinberg and Abdus-Salam. They claimed that a spontaneous breaking of a symmetry invariance was at the base of the differentiation between the electro-magnetic and the weak forces. In the symmetrical invariance, all four bosons mediating the electro-magnetism and the; weak interaction were massless. After the breaking of the symmetry, the photon-mediating electro-magnetism remained massless, but the three particles mediating the weak force (W+ W- Z°) acquired a large mass. The catalyst which triggered the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry was denoted the Higgs particle after its discoverer. It is important to point out that the Weinberg-Salam unification of the electro-magnetic and weak forces was made possible by Yang and Mills who developed the measurement criteria (gauges) by which to provide a complementary field to the broken symmetry in order to restore invariance. The Yang-Mills gauge symmetry restoration principle has also been applied to the strong nuclear force. This gauge symmetrical theory, developed by Gellmann and Fritzch and denoted as quantum chromo-dynamics, relates to quarks and their color charges. These color charges were red, blue, and yellow: the three primary colors. If rotated these three primary colors achieved the invariant colorless symmetry of</page><page sequence="27">Epilogue and Overture 137 white. According to the gauge symmetry of quantum chromodynamics, all three quarks constituting the hadron have color charges. The quarks are glued together by boson power particles named gluons. This is effected by the eight color-carrying gluons that interact with the three quarks inside the hadrons as well as with themselves. The gauge symmetry invariance is restored here by the gluons. When a quark emits a colored gluon and thereby changes its color, it also breaks the symmetry of the (white) colorless invariance of the whole hadron, due to the complementary rotation of the three basic colors (red, blue, and yellow) of the three quarks. This broken symmetry is immediately restored by another quark within the hadron, absorbing the colored gluon and changing its own color in a complementary manner, which would restore a colorless symmetry to the hadron. An important point here is that whereas the breaking of symmetry in quantum electro-dynamics is spontaneous, the breaking and restoration of quantum-chromo-dynamics is hidden. There is no way to pry open a hadron and measure the charges of individual quarks. Gauge symmetries have been applied in an attempt to transform bosons (power particles) into fermions (matter particles). This attempt has been denoted as the supersymmetry of grand unification theories (Susy Gut). The particle-antiparticle duality may also be related to a symmetry breaking restoration context. Dirac's original conceptualization of the particle-antiparticle relationship was anchored on the imagery of a sea of negative energy electrons in a vacuum. When a high energy photon hits one of the negative energy electrons it infuses it with energy so that it flies up excitedly filled with positive energy. What remains in the sea of negative energy electrons in the place of the electron which was excited out of its place and injected with positive energy is a hole. This hole is a lack, an absence of a negatively charged particle with negative energy. Two negatives make a positive and indeed this hole is a positron, the electron's antiparticle. Schematically, this may be presented as follows: Figure 3.9 Dirac's Ocean42</page><page sequence="28">138 God as the Shadow of Man This is clearly a breaking of the symmetry with the lack, the hole, wishing to be filled up again by a restoration of the symmetry; yet this longing of the electron and positron to reunite, to fill up the asymmetrical hole, is a self-defeating venture. When the electron and its anti-particle, the positron, meet, they annihilate each other, and the photon is emitted back into infinity. One moral of the story is that the fulfillment of a quest means annihilation and death. This could provide one clue to the fact that our participant longings and Sisyphean quests are never fulfilled, so that the processes of creation and revelation are endless. In a similar vein, the dialectical breaking and restoration of symmetries in the realm of energy-matter are also endless, in ever-recurring Sisyphean and Tantalic cycles. The Flying Dutchman is ever reincarnated, and the quest for a transformation from the karma of the samsara wheel to the Nirvana of a Mandala are unrealizable dreams. Mytho-empirically, this is projected by Lurianic Kabbala as the inability to achieve a complete tikkun, a complete mending of the rift between man and transcendence. The breaking of the vessels was the initial cosmic catastrophe catapulting man as a particle of divinity away from his sacred source. Thence, the efforts of man to mend a blemished God (and himself) by the manufacture of grace was again thwarted by original sin. Yet Sisyphus, Tantalus, and Prometheus stooped down, lifted their worn-out tools, and started to mend the injured God-man - only to be hurled back to the abyss by the sin of the golden calf. These alternations of grace-stern-judgment are endless and will continue ad infinitum. We shall never, states Haim Vital stoically in his Etz-Haim , achieve complete tikkun.43 The dialectical spiral of the anthropic connecting agent effecting endless cycles of creativity and revelation by linking together the ani-consciousness and energy-matter will never cease. This is the thing-in-itself, the only reality; it is all there is. As for the mytho-empirical evidence for the macro processes leading from the Big Bang to the big crunch and back to a resurrected genesis, there is an abundance of choices from almost every culture. We shall choose two representative myths - one from a participant, Tantalic culture and the other from a séparant, Sisyphean one. The first is none other than the biblical myth of the Flood which has many counterparts in ancient Mid-eastem mythologies. Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of Genesis state, inter alia, as follows: 6: 5. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6:6.And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.</page><page sequence="29">Epilogue and Overture 139 6:7.And the Lord said, 'I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.' 6:8.But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. 6: 13. And God said unto Noah, 'The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 6:14. 'Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shall pitch it within and without with pitch. 6:18. 'But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 6:19. 'And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 7:4. 'For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.' 7:9.There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 7:21. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 8:1. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged; 8: 17. Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 8:22. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.44 We have here the participant stress on the moral depravity of man as the basis for the world's destruction. However, in order to assure the eventual resurrection of the world the basic dualities of life were preserved by admitting couples of all fauna into Noah's Ark. Thence, after the revival of the earth's life forms, verse 22 of chapter 7 of Genesis promises the eternal recurrence of day and night the four seasons and the seeding-harvesting cycles. A more violently séparant destruction-resurrection myth involving, not only the fauna, but also the world's flora and its elements is the Ragna Rok or Götterdämmerung , the twilight of the gods of the Germanic Eddas.</page><page sequence="30">1 40 God as the Shadow of Man The sun becomes dark. Earth sinks in the sea. The shining stars slip out of the sky. Vapor and fire rage fiercely together till the leaping flame licks heaven itself.45 The wolf, Fenrir, swallows the sun, the séparant life-giver and matri-normative symbol of dominion over fecundity and nature. The dissolution of culture and the family is marked by the emergence of the snake, the primeval phallus, escaping from its abyss and poisoning the sea with unchasteness, after which the land is flooded. Moreover, the proscription of incest, which sublimates forbidden sex into culture, breaks down, bringing about the disintegration of civilization.46 Brothers shall fight and slay each other, Sisters' sons break kinship bonds, Hard it is on each with much unchasteness.47 Finally, the Aesir will be vanquished by their enemies; their swords and shields broken and cloven. The chaotic 'wind age, wolf-age' will reign supreme, and the world will sink under, as fire burns out the gods and creation. This is the end of a Sisyphean cycle. The Promethean fire which was instrumental in forging man's culture now destroys man, his artifacts, and his gods. After the doom, a new Sisyphean cycle will be initiated, and the resurrection of the world initiated by a new sun. The god Balder will rise Christ-like from the dead, and Lif (life) and Lifthrasir (the one who holds fast to life), the new human couple, will repopulate the earth. Here the resurrection not only involves the fauna, but the new Sisyphean cycle restructures a new cosmos, a new creation sired by resuscitated deities. Thus, the inability of our core-vectors as well as the basic forces of energy-matter to achieve their teleological aims raise the participant unrequited longings, the unfulfilled séparant quest, and, especially, the dialectics between them to the stature of a universal prime mover. Mytho-empirically, this is beautifully portrayed by the myth of the heart and the spring recounted by Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav: The heart and the spring are divided from each other by a mountain and cannot reach each other, yet the impossibility of their encounter makes their longing more intense. Hence, the unrequited longing in itself generates continuous energy. Rabbi Nachman was so convinced by the primacy of longing per se that he even risked the sacrilege of the affirmation of doubt, because the longing for a presumably unattainable perfection intensifies faith and raises it to a higher stature. In this, he shares the conviction of Kierkegaard that renunciation may enhance faith.</page><page sequence="31">Epilogue and Overture 1 4 1 Renunciation of a goal turns the process into a goal in itself. Relinquishing the realization of the hopes for Godot's coming turned the waiting for him into a timeless vocation. Jesus' kiss on the forehead of Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor might have symbolized his agreement to the latter' s waiver of the Second Coming. The longing for the Second Coming may enhance the belief in God (and the interests of the church) more than the reappearance of the Messiah. Renunciation of a goal and anchoring on the process creates ritualism which in sociology was tagged by Robert K. Merton as anomic deviance.48 In our context, the ritualist is a success, since he anchors on the processes of life and on the continuous present, which if authentic could enhance revelation and creativity. The renunciation of achievements and ends enables one to realize that time-space and causality are cognitive filters, and that the underlying realities - the things-in-themselves - are yearnings, independent of their telos. The relinquishing of the telos frees us from beginnings and ends. The processes and the dialectics of yearning, as the transcendental things-in-themselves, render us into quanta without mass, into flows of energies which are common both to us and to God. Renunciation is also extant in the mytho-empirical sale by Esau of his birthright to Jacob. This is a mythological projection of the normative directive of older children to relinquish their possessions and rights to their younger siblings. Renunciation is also apparent on a grand scale in the willing victims of the Isaac Syndrome. This sacrificial normativeness is inherent in the feeling of righteousness concomitant with sacrificing one's wealth, well-being, and, even, life for a norm or an ideal. The Kabbalist account of Joseph Dela Reinha by Abraham Ben Eliezer Halevi49 tells of the protagonist, a Spanish pre-expulsion practical Kabbalist, who tried to bring about redemption by prayer, rituals, and magic. Yet, in one of his rites, either purposely or inadvertently, he offered incense ( levonah ) to Satan. This, of course, further postponed salvation, and like Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor vindicated the greater importance of waiting, longing, and yearning for salvation as against its realization. This is highlighted by George Steiner' s Mount Nevo syndrome. Steiner claims that the spiritual excellence of the Jews was greater in the Diaspora, when their longing for Zion fueled their creative energies, than in Israel. In Hasidism, we find the statement by Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, whose doctrine was influenced by Lurianic Kabbala, that 'when grace is postponed and (God) does not endow us with his peace, then we have to strive for his revelation'.50 Hence, the striving for divine revelation is preferred by Rabbi Nachman to actual theophany. This can be seen as a mytho-empirical projection of the</page><page sequence="32">1 42 God as the Shadow of Man dynamics of the internal saboteur. A person who is successful in business, for instance, may make a grave error or a patently stupid move when he could or must have been aware of its disastrous effects. Such an error may be explained by our core dynamics. The suppressed participant core-vector of his personality surged up to sabotage the achievements of the séparant core-vector, so that the renewed longing for success might resuscitate and recharge his presumably dwindling core energies. For Kierkegaard, the renunciation of goals effects an éxtasis to a continuous present and to an authentic process of coming. He says: The principle that the existing subjective thinker is constantly occupied in striving, does not mean that he has, in the finite sense, a goal toward which he strives and that he would be finished when he reaches this goal. No, he strives infinitely, is constantly in a process of becoming. And this, his striving, is safeguarded by his constantly being just as negative as he is positive and by his having as much essential humor as essential pathos; which has its ground in the fact that he is an existing individual and reflects this in his thinking. This process of becoming is the thinker's own existence: from which it is, indeed, possible to make abstraction, but only thoughtlessly, in order to become objective. How far the subjective thinker has come along this road, whether a long distance or a short one, makes no essential difference. This is, indeed, only a finitely relative comparison; but, as long as he is an existing individual, he is in the process of becoming.51 And likewise: 'Earthly hope must be killed. Only then can one be saved by true hope'. The renunciation of the hope of realizing one's quests in the here-and-now prepares one for a leap of faith in transcendence. If Kierkegaard's waiver is sublime, the following renunciation is shmaltzy and kitschy: Nora stood up, 4 Well, I'd better leave now. . . ' 'I wish you happiness. . . 'Sean said, putting his arms around her. For a moment they stood silently together. She was soft and sweet, an angel of love. He could feel her determination begin to melt into surrender. If he insisted now he could have her, he was sure, have a life with her in which the sweetness would never end. Images from their past love tumbled through his mind. Oakland Beach... Amalfi... Yet surely the sweetness would be short-lived. Not having her, he could love her forever. Not for Jimmy McGuire, not for all the priests of Chicago, not even for the Pope, but for Nora. . .yes, for Nora. . .he would do what his damn fool church and his damn fool God wanted him to do. He disengaged himself from the embrace. 'I've got to get ready for Mass.'52</page><page sequence="33">Epilogue and Overture 1 43 Yet the effect is the same - a transition from ends to processes, from time to timelessness, from paradox to transcendence. By renouncing the theophany of Godot, Beckett's tramps may experience transcendence just by waiting for it. As one critic put it, they may sing a 'Kyrie without God'.53 Finally, Camus's Dr. Rieux gives up all hope of vanquishing the plague, yet he can experience grace by treating its victims. The linkage between the human developmental phases and passing over or smuggling the barriers between them and the developmental phases of energy-matter is effected by who else than man - the great anthropic mediator. The individual human being is endowed with a uniqueness which stems from his irreplicable link between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter in all their combinations and permutations and the various formations of human aggregates. The individual is the only human entity capable of authentic dialogue, revelation, and creativity. The phalanx, the army groups, are séparant, carnivorous power structures. States, parties, and universities are demiurgical organizations, with no freedom of will, but rather algorithmically programmed to preserve themselves. The individual is the only entity empowered with real indeterminism, and, as such, God is mytho-empirically created in his own image. Finally, crowds and audiences are carnivorous organizations. Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and James Dean are the modern counterparts of Mithra, Horus, and Varuna. They may achieve dialogue with some members of their audience, but, as a crowd, any audience is a multi-headed Gorgon aiming to swallow ingest, and possess their idols. Often the fans drive them to suicide, drugs, and madness, performing a modern rite of human sacrifice, and, then, projecting it onto mythology as resurrected deities. In thirteenth-century Spanish ecstatic Kabbala, man's participant longing to unite with God is expressed by one of Abraham Abulafia's disciples as follows: Man is the last of the compound entities and is, therefore, represented by the letter yod, that is, the number ten, which is considered the last primary number. He is the yod in this world, who has received the power from the all, and he comprises the all, like the yod in [the realm of] the sefirot. Understand, therefore, that there is no discernible difference between this yod and that yod, but a very fine one from the aspect of spirituality, and that it [the letter yod] is the milluy [contents] of the other yod... And this is the secret [of the verse] 'and cleave unto Him' - the cleaving of yod to yod, in order to complete the circle.54 In a similar vein, the Maggid Dov-Baer of Meseritz states in his drash (hermeneutic) on the meaning of the verse, 'Make thee two trumpets':</page><page sequence="34">1 44 God as the Shadow of Man Two halves of forms, as it is written 4 on the throne, a likeness in the appearance of a man above upon it, as man [Adam] is but D and M, and the speech dwells upon him. And when he unites with God, who is the alpha of the world, he becomes 'Adam. . .and man must separate himself from any corporeal things, to such an extent that he will ascend through all the worlds and be in union with God, until [his] existence will be annihilated, and then he will be called 'Adam'. The Maggid bases his homily on the verse: 'Make thee two trumpets of silver, of a whole piece shall thou make them'. The Hebrew word for trumpets, Hazozerot, is interpreted as Hazi-zurot, that is, '[two] half-forms'.55 However, as actual union with God is impossible in the here-and-now, the longing for it in itself may effect a participant experience of a unio mystica. The same holds true for Gnostic mytho-empiricism. The meaning of Gnosis is to revert back to the original perfection of non-being and to partake in the alien, ex-temporal God. The following Hermetic prayer is quite illuminating: Saved by thy light, we rejoice that thou hast shown thyself to us whole, we rejoice that thou hast made us gods while still in our bodies through the vision of thee. Man's only thanks-offering to thee is to know thy greatness. We came to know thee, O light of human life, we came to know thee, O light of all gnosis, we have come to know thee, O womb impregnated by the seed of thy father... In adoration of thy grace, we ask no other grace but that thou shouldst preserve us in thy gnosis and that we shall not stumble from the life so gained.56 We have here, first, the revelatory partaking in God, so that we become gods ourselves. Second, gnosis is contained in the womb, which is clear evidence of the projected quest to annul birth and revert to the non-being in the womb. Third, gnosis may be experienced by our soul in the evil here-and-now, while it is still entrapped in its profane body, through a revelatory vision of God. Gnosis is, therefore, a form of grace for the alien souls stranded in the squalor of creation.57 Hence, actual reversal to non-being is not necessary for a Gnostic revelatory experience of non-being - the longing for it may in itself provide the participant fuel to effect it. We claim that our yearning, be it for Sisyphean possession of objects and life forms or Tantalic longing to fuse with them, is the essence of our being. The process of involvement kindles our energies and not the attainment of our goals, which are as unachievable as the aims of our</page><page sequence="35">Epilogue and Overture 1 45 participant and séparant core-vectors. Nietzsche laments not so much his lost love for Lou as the destruction of his illusions of love and his ability to long for it.58 Indeed, Plato describes this yearning for union as follows: For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else which the soul either evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment. Suppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the pair who are lying side by side and say to them, "What do you people want of one another?" They would be unable to explain. And suppose further, that when he saw their perplexity he said: "Do you desire to be wholly one; always day and night to be in one another's company? For if this is what you desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live a common life as if you were a single man, and after your death in the world below still be one departed soul instead of two - I ask whether this is what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attain this?" There is not a man of them who, when he heard the proposal, would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need. And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love.59 The essence of love is, thus, not the attainment of unity, but the longing for it. In a similar vein, our childhood memories have a life of their own detached from our adult present. The middle-aged men and women in class reunions seem de trop compared with our memories, and the encounter with our overweight, double-chinned, talkative first-love of a generation ago all but kills cherished memories. Moreover, our nostalgic participant yearning for the past and the séparant longing for the future provide our activating energy. They are the real dynamics behind appearances; they are the thing-in-itself. In Gnosis, we find the gospel of truth claiming this: The Father, this perfect one who created the All, in whom the All is and whom the All lacks for he had withheld in himself his perfection, which he had not given to the All.60 The lack is presented as a prime mover of the All which longs for the perfection withheld from it. This could provide a mytho-empirical anchor for the longing of the expelled particle of divinity (the human soul) to reunite with the godhead in primordial perfection. In the Hypostasis of the Archons, we find that when the powers of darkness saw the image of incorruption which was reflected in the water, 'they were inflamed with love towards it and wanted to seize it'.61</page><page sequence="36">1 46 God as the Shadow of Man This would seem to be the mytho-empirical projection of the séparant type's wish to reunite with the object/other by swallowing and incorporating it within himself. However, the Book of Thomas the Savior laments that the love of light symbolizing the godhead is unattainable.62 This is the mytho-empirical vindication of our meta-myths of Sisyphus and Tantalus as metaphors for the unachievability of our yearnings as their energizing force. In Theosophic Kabbala, we find that the participant quest of the strewn particles to reunite with their perfect nothingness is impossible, since it would lead to the annihilation of the temporal worlds.63 As the godhead does not desire this ultimate union of man with infinity it cannot be realized. Indeed, just as the revolving sword of fire does not allow man to return to paradise so the particles of divinity strewn amidst the vile kellipot are not allowed to return to their divine source.64 This is so, apparently in order to preserve their yearning to return to their source as a constant motivational force. In Existentialism, we have Kierkegaard stating that the human mind yearns for the absolute, yet cannot reach it; hence, his quests become continuous. Man searches for the aesthetic idea which he can never dominate and, thus, becomes dominated by the quest. The aesthetic man anchors, according to Kierkegaard, on the outside, whereas the ethical man probes into his inner-self. His aim is to negate himself so that his historical self merges with the infinity of his inner-self. This aim cannot be achieved, and all that remains is the longing for it. The religious man, prompted by his unconditional faith, anchors on the insoluble paradox of the fusion of the historical with the non-historical. This faith, or if one wishes, this longing to solve the insoluble paradox fuels man's belief: credo quia absurdum. Unrequited longing is a constant malaise, a constant lack. If these unfulfilled quests are our prime movers, then life indeed is characterized as Heidegger postulated, by angst (anxiety) and sorge (worry). We go even further than Heidegger by claiming that pain is the central phenomenon of life, both physical and mental, and only authentic revelation and creativity may provide a temporary relief from it. Finally, the relationship between the man-God-object triad and the God-object-dyad is one of a self-other conflict and a godhead-demiurgos strife. If we abstract all these three relationships, we have lack, strife, and frustration, which are perceived by the individual as varying dosages and kinds of pain. Hence, the universal emotive principle is pain. This was expounded by Freud in his pleasure principle, according to which pleasure is the reduction of frustration, irritation, and pain. Freud confined the pleasure principle to intra-psychic dynamics, whereas we</page><page sequence="37">Epilogue and Overture 1 47 regard pain as governing both the temporal and transcendental relationships of man. Moreover, our programming, with its remarkable ability to utilize a very limited number of parameters - the four nucleotides of genetics, the four powers of physics, the two sexes required for procreation in most species, the two core personality vectors - to control and activate creation, utilizes pain not only to activate man but also to preserve him and regulate his relationships. Thus, pain guards the organism against injury, it serves as a communicative medium, it prods man to seek creativity and revelation. As we have seen, when internalized by Ego, suffering may form a basis for an existentialist system of ethics. In Existentialism, this is marked by the Heideggerean angst and sorge and by Kierkegaard's description of human existence as characterized by fear and trembling. Life is marked by varying degrees of deprivational interaction, yet its motivating efficiency is curvilinear. A moderate dosage of it prods us to act and create, but too much of it crushes us under the Sisyphean stone or the Tantalic rock, as in the earlier version of the myth. The Greek meden agan serves as a working maxim in this case too. One cannot create if afflicted by unbearable agony. For revelation, one should 'let pain flower' as Kierkegaard counseled, but a crushing blow damns the flow of grace and prevents it from reaching the victim. Lack, pain, and frustration are ordained by the developmental phases of the human child and adolescent. The fetus is accustomed to a soft self-sufficient coziness in the womb only to be expelled into a world of changing temperatures, hard surfaces, and erratic feeding and care by the breast-mother. In early orality, we feel an Edenic pantheistic togetherness with our surroundings only to be confined into the scar tissues of the ego-boundary and the loneliness of later orality. Within the family fold, the adolescent usually enjoys an unconditional forgiveness for almost everything he says or does, until the sacrificial rites of passage of the Isaac Syndrome thrust him into the cruel rat race of socio-economic competition and full normative and legal responsibility. The openness of the infant and the adolescent expectations of an I-thou encounter with his surroundings are usually frustrated and meet with an I-it response. Hence, man's relationship with his surroundings is characterized by a deprivational interaction interspersed with occasional spells of grace. Mytho-empirically, this is represented by oc^epcov, the Greek river of woe surrounding hell. Man's communication with his infernal others, to extend Sartre's metaphor, takes place through a flow of agony. Moreover, man does not initially know that 'hell is other people'. On the contrary, he is conditioned by previous developmental phases to expect a welcoming and comforting other only to have his innocence bruised, scarred, and</page><page sequence="38">1 48 God as the Shadow of Man raped by the I-it other. According to Lurianic Kabbala, God also created the world in order to give and to share his flowing grace. However, the breaking of the vessels caused him to lose control over it and since then he has been confronted by the Sitra Achara, the sinister powers. Man in his struggle with his infernal other, thus, reflects an image of God in his conflict with the demiurgos. The message here is unequivocal: man in pain reflects a suffering God (Christ). Perfect theistic gods do not suffer. They make their creatures suffer, either to entertain themselves like Roman caesars watching the throes of man and beast in the arena or partake vicariously in the joys and sorrows of their creatures and, thus, extricate themselves from solitude in eternity. The God of Lurianic Kabbala is a suffering God and, hence, imperfect and blemished. The Gnostic God is pestered and attacked by the demiurgos and his archons. The Kabbalist rung of keter, which is an integral part of the godhead, is denoted by the partzuf, the countenance, of arich anpin - literally, the 'long suffering' - while Kierkegaard's existentialist God is effectively involved in his creation through his suffering son. The suffering Christ on the cross broadcasts an appeal for communication and help on behalf of the blemished godhead and a maieutic message to man to seek revelation. Man has the choice whether to open or close himself to the God-man's cry of anguish. When this call of distress is felt within the inner-self, it represents the universal awareness of the godhead. In Gnosis, the soul was initially a part of the godhead, but afterwards, she fell into a body and came into this life, then she fell into the hands of the robbers. And the insolent tossed her to one another and [defiled] her. Some used her violently, others persuaded her by a deceitful gift. In brief, they dishonored her. She [lost] her virginity and played the harlot with her body and gave herself to everyone. And the one to whom she adheres, she thinks he is her husband. Whenever she gave herself to the insolent, faithless adulterers that they might misuse her, then she sighed heavily and repented. Again, when she turns her face away from these paramours she runs to others, and they compel her to be with them and to serve them like the lords on their couches. But from shame she no longer dares to forsake them. But they deceive her for a long time (by behaving) in the manner of true and genuine husbands, as if they honored her greatly, and at the end of all these things they abandon her and go. But she becomes a poor deserted widow who has no help - nor does she gain a hearing in her suffering; for she has no benefit at all from them, except the defilements which they gave her when they consorted with her. And those whom she bore by the adulterers are deaf and blind and sickly, their heart is bemused. But when the Father who is above in Heaven visits her and looks down upon her</page><page sequence="39">Epilogue and Overture 1 49 and sees her sighing with her passion and the unseemliness and repenting over her harlotry which she has committed, and she begins to call upon his [na]me that he may help her, [sighing] with all her heart and saying: 'Deliver me, my father. For behold, I will give account to [you], because I have forsaken my house and have fled from my maiden chamber. Once again I turn to you.' When he sees that she is of such a character, then will he resolve to make her worthy that he take pity on her, for much pain has come upon her because she abandoned her house.'65 The soul - the particle of divinity - was exploited, assaulted, raped, battered, manipulated, and manhandled after falling into its demiurgical body, yet the soul's cry of anguish pierced the boundaries of history and reached the godhead. In a similar manner, Isaac Yehuda Yehiel Safrin, the nineteenth-century Hasid and Kabbalist, recounts his revelatory experiences. Because of their importance, we shall quote them at length: In 1845, on the 21st day of the Omer, I was in the town of Dukla. I arrived there late at night, and it was dark, and there was no one to take me home, except for a tanner who came and took me into his house. I wanted to pray Ma' ari v and to count the Omer, but I was unable to do it there, so I went to the Beit Midrash alone, and there I prayed until midnight had passed. And I understood from this situation the plight of the Shekhina in exile and Her suffering when She is standing in the market of tanners. And I wept many times before the Lord of the world, out of the depth of my heart, for the suffering of the Shekhina in exile, and Her suffering when She is standing in the market of tanners. And I wept many times before the Lord of the world, out of the depth of my heart, for the suffering of the Shekhina. And through my suffering and weeping, I fainted and I fell asleep for a while, and I saw a vision of light, splendor, and great brightness, in the image of a virgin adorned with twenty-four ornaments... And she said: 'Be strong, my son' etc. and I was suffering that I could not see but the vision of her back and I was not worthy to receive her face. And I was told that [this was because] I am alive, and it is written, "for no man shall see me, and live.66 It was his [R. Zevi Hirsch' s] custom regarding the matter of holiness, to pray in order to bring upon himself a state of suffering, uneasiness, and affliction on every eve of Sabbath. This was done in order to efface himself completely before the Sabbath so as to be able to receive His light, be He blessed, during the prayer and the meal of the Sabbath [eve] with a pure, holy, and clear heart. This was his custom regarding the matter of holiness, due to his constant fear lest arrogant and alien thoughts would enter his heart. Once on the Feast of Shavuot, hundreds of people crowded around him. Before the [morning]</page><page sequence="40">1 50 God as the Shadow of Man prayer, with the [first] light of dawn, I entered one of his rooms, but he did not see me, for he was pacing about the room to and fro, weeping and causing heaven and earth to weep with him before God. And it is impossible to write it down. And he humbled himself before God with a mighty weeping , supplicating that he not be rejected from the light of His face - then I was overcome by a great trembling, because of the awe of the Shekhina and I opened the door and ran away.67 His weeping and suffering mirror the crying and pain of the Divine Presence (the Shekhina) and this brings about the revelatory encounter between them. The pain Safrin radiated and the pain of the Shekhina received by him made him a flowing stream,68 a communicative current of pain. In his revelatory experiences and his search for the roots of his soul, Safrin was convinced that he was the Messiah, the son of Joseph.69 Indeed, his being a Messiah was necessary for synchronization between the ani (the inner-self) and the ayin (infinity), which contains the same letters in Hebrew but in a different order. The message here is that only a Messiah, a son of God, can serve as the mediator between the infinity (ayin) of the godhead and the historical self (ani). Only the man-God, who is at once both in history and outside it, can effect a union between the godhead and its particle (soul). Finally, Kierkegaard discusses the man-God's paradoxical offense of declaring himself to be God. Yet through the common suffering of man and God which meets in the man-God, the revelatory communion between man and God is made possible. Man suffering in history cries from his inner self, 'Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord'. This is reciprocated by the God-man's shriek of anguish, 'Eli Eli lama sabakhtani'. And both cries of pain are synchronized in Christ on the cross. In him the suffering is historical. The suffering of God and man integrates both history and eternity. This is the feat accomplished by the revelatory leap of faith through the communicative force of pain. A blemished suffering God and man, in fear and trembling in history, can communicate in an ever-suffering Christ. The savior's kiss continuously seared the forehead of Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor as a painful communicative reminder of God's presence in the here-and-now. Camus's judge-penitent's refusal to heed the drowning girl's cry for help in The Fall was the existentialist original sin because it blocked the communication between man and transcendence. It prevented the judge-penitent from feeling the suffering of the girl within his inner-self and from communing with her by saving her. Her unanswered cry of anguish became a free-floating piece of scar tissue which encapsulated both protagonists in their solipsistic solitude.</page><page sequence="41">Epilogue and Overture 1 5 1 An answered cry for help, on the other hand, extricates both man and God from their impending solipsism. Indeed, Kierkegaard demonstrates how the crucifixion in an eternal present crosses timelessness and history. The Gnostic messenger, the Kabbalist Shekhina, and Kierkegaard's Christ, who differs radically from the son of God of institutionalized Christianity, pierce the walls of the demiurgical tornado with their cries of anguish and reach the covert flow of grace within the eye of the storm. Brel's ne me quitte pas, which is a variation on the theme of separation anxieties, is absorbed into the innermost selves of the audience, thus, effecting a direct communication with the artist. Bosch's Christ transmits his suffering to St. Veronica, as symbolized by the image of his face which was imprinted on the handkerchief with which she wiped his face. Christ's suffering radiates from his agonized, yet graceful, face stoically calm amid the gaggle of vile, ugly, cruel, stupid, covetous, violent, and debauched faces surrounding him, until it seems to reach the innermost serenity of St. Veronica who contemplates Christ's image on the handkerchief. This image seems to be visible only to her since she is attuned to the pain emanating from the man-God. The poet Nelli Sacks sang of the pain she sensed was emanating from one of the stones of the Wailing Wall. Pierre Legendre, a world renowned legal anthropologist, confessed to the author, 'without misery I would feel lonely'. In Greek, sympatheia, sympathy, is literally the feeling of suffering with the other. Indeed, pain extricates both man and transcendence from ontological loneliness. The communicative effect of pain was recognized by the sixteenth-century Safedean Kabbalists. Abraham Halevi Baruchim woke up every night at midnight and wandered the streets shrieking in a bitter voice: 'Wake up to honor God, the Shekhina is in exile, our temple is burnt down, and the people of Israel are in great trouble'. The circle of Lurianic kabbalists in Safed practiced the tikkun Rachel, behaving as follows: 'They took off their shoes, dressed their heads in mourning, and cried with all their might'. In this way they partook in the suffering of the Shekhina. The suffering of man and the pains of God coincide within the exiled Holy Presence. As for the effect of tears as a communicative medium between man and God, Haim Vital states the matter this way: When a person weeps and sheds tears for [the death of] a righteous man, he also causes tears to be shed on high, as it were, of God [Himself]. As it is said: 'The Lord God of Hosts will call to weeping and mourning' etc., [or] 'my soul shall weep in secret', etc., or as it is written: 'Oh that my head were waters [and my eyes a fountain of tears]' - namely, that I long for the act of the lower [entities], as by weeping below, they cause 'my head to be as waters and my</page><page sequence="42">1 52 God as the Shadow of Man eyes a fountain of tears.' May they do so, and, thereby, I may also weep for my dead.70 Pain, thus, almost automatically effects a dialogue between man and God. According to Kierkegaard, the crucified Jesus effects an éxtasis, in the Greek sense, from the sequences of time, and, hence, his pain is continuously manifest in the perpetuity of the present.71 The suffering of Christ is also introjected by man as pertaining to his own daily crucifixion. Thus, Christ pierces the imminent solipsism of man by partaking in his suffering self-image. The shriek of a normatively sacrificed Isaac meets the God's laments which are communicated to the innermost being of man through the tribulations of His son on the cross. The suffering of God as felt by man may break his heart; yet, as Rabbi Nachman of Brazlav taught, 'There is nothing so whole as a broken heart'. The calvary of Christ radiates Lacrimoe Rerum into man, but also fills him with the enthousiasmos (again in the Greek sense) which connotes the entry of divinity within man. Physical pain is the demiurge's tool for guarding 'his property' - the body. Without the pain incidental to bodily injury, disease, and death, most human beings and many other creatures would probably take their own lives. The demiurgos controls a built-in safety mechanism to keep the inmates exiled particles of divinity - incarcerated in their temporal prison, i.e., the body. Without pain, the souls would easily destroy their prison-body and revert back to their origin in the Godhead. The demiurgical ananké, the coercive cosmic forces, as well as evolution, also avail themselves of pain in order to implement their aims. If one exceeds one's moira, the Furies strike with a vengeance in order to push the deviants back into line. Those who do not fit the designs of evolution are wiped painfully, yet unceremoniously, out of history. Suffering and history are true phenomena, yet pain is also instrumental in jolting man out of his complacency in his demiurgical body and his fear of eternity (death). Man's revolt against his demiurgical ananké and moira is, thus, prompted by pain, and some suffering (though not too much) is also necessary for revelation and creativity. Dostoevski says that one should be worthy of one's suffering. In our model this would mean that one must first experience an impasse, a fall, a breaking of the vessels, an exile in order to embark subsequently on the rebellious road of creativity and revelation. This is expressed by Kierkegaard as 'letting the pain flower' and represented by Rabbi Nachman' s seeking of hardship and suffering in order to reach a higher rung of grace.</page><page sequence="43">Epilogue and Overture 1 53 In Existentialism, suffering, if it does not crush the protagonist, leads him to a deeper insight into himself and into his relationships with his surroundings and with transcendence. This is the professed reason for Rabbi Nachman's search for a Machloikess, disagreement or quarrel, with his surroundings in order to experience the cathartic pain and suffering leading to spiritual revelation. 'We begin to live', said Yeats in his autobiography, 'when we have conceived life as tragedy'.72 As for creativity, we have Damocles, who never danced so well as when the sword was hanging over his head. A Celtic myth tells of a bird which impales itself on a thorn in order to sing its most beautiful song. Ezra Pound wrote his most powerful Cantos after the 'braves' of Pizza imprisoned him in a cage in the marketplace to be laughed and spat at by the passers-by. Kierkegaard's and Rabbi Nachman's conception of the cleansing value of pain was shared by Kordo vero who said, 'Those who suffer willingly will be cleansed and purified... until they become as clean and pure as silver (Psalms 130:1)'. Suffering is a precedent condition ordained by the Holy Presence prior to salvation.73 In Mandean Gnosis, suffering and exposure to destructive lions and to the carnivorous dragon that surrounds the world preceded the healing and deliverance of the human soul from its demiurgical tribulations.74 The suffering of the other, as internalized by me, brings me first to recognize the other's existence as a separate entity, and enables me to sympathize and empathize with him. This non-verbal communication, which has to be reached through dialogue, generates within me a flow of grace which is shared - as inferred by me epistemologically - by the other. This is the essence of Dr. Rieux' s feeling of grace when he treats the sick and tries to ease their pain, although he knows that he can never vanquish the plague. In order for the treatment of physical and mental ills to be authentic and, hence, effective, the healer must empathize with a concrete sufferer and not with an abstract or imaginary one. Often, people identify with the suffering of actors in films or characters in novels, thus, avoiding the need to identify with real sufferers or to help a concrete person in pain. Opening up to the suffering of the other is a prime communication dynamic which extricates man from solipsism. It posits both healer and sufferer in the grace of an authentic encounter within a present which becomes continuous, in that it lends meaning outside sequential time both to the life of the helper and to that of the person helped. Thus, Mother Theresa, treating the lepers of Calcutta, sees in them the image of the suffering son of God. This might lend a new interpretation to St. John's dictum: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</page><page sequence="44">1 54 God as the Shadow of Man that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16)'. God's need was for communication with man about his predicament and for man to effect a 'mending', a Kabbalist tikkun, through creativity and theurgic revelation. The causa causans for the sacrifice was, therefore, the crossing between time and eternity effected by the crucifixion, so that the Godhead's anguish outside of time would be heard and heeded by man within history. As each human being, or, for that matter, creature, is epistemologically transcendental to Ego, feeling of the suffering of the other and a readiness to respond to it facilitates a dialogue with both the transcendental and temporal son of God. The covenant between the man-God and the God-man represented by any authentic dialogue is wrought by common suffering. We see, thus, that lack, deprivation, and pain constitute our prime movers. They are the fuel that activates us. They lead us to higher echelons of revelation and creativity. However, the relationship between revelation, creativity, and pain is curvilinear: too little is ineffective whereas too much pain risks our being crushed by the Sisyphean rock and by the Tantalic stone in the earlier version of the myth of Tantalus. Pain guards the structure and function of our bodies and serves as a prime communication agent. Pain is also the activating agent in the acquisition of morals. We have seen that normativeness needs the pain of sacrifice. Moreover, as the dialectics between participant longing and séparant quests are the Ding an Sich (the thing in itself), the underlying reality of objects, artifacts, and life forms, and our prime mover - the refueling and recharging of the batteries of these core dialectics takes place through more deprivation and pain: this again occurs in a curvilinear manner and is structured properly by myths which are the prime form palatable to our core dialectics. Thus, the myths of martyrs feed our Tantalic normativeness. The stunning efficacy of Christianity stems, inter alia, from the fact that Jesus Christ the arch martyr is ever crucified in a continuous present - thus continuously fueling the core-batteries of Christians with participant normativeness. Heroes and, especially, the myths about them, rejuvenate, refresh, and resuscitate the deflated séparant core batteries of political ideologies. Finally, one is ever stunned by Vincent Van Gogh and by the force of the myths about the trials of this Promethean innovator as well as by the effects they have on artists and aspiring artists. This recharging of our core batteries is a continuous process. Each of our experiences can provide us with séparant creative fuel or stifle us. The mass communication media as well as all literature and art expose us to an endless torrent of mythology, and it is our indeterministic decision whether or not to expose ourselves to the authenticity of a Jacques Brel or</page><page sequence="45">Epilogue and Overture 1 5 5 to the shmaltzy crooning of a Tino Rossi, to be inspired by the borderline crudeness of Batman or by the rebellious authenticity of a Keating in The Dead Poets ' Society , to swallow the name-dropping and shallow profundities of a Simone de Beauvoir, only because her journals are reviewed by Le Monde, and Le Figaro and are discussed in I ' Apostrophe or to read the all-but-forgotten, yet authentic and ever-relevant, journals of Karl Kraus. A burning instance of a fatally stifling experience is the encounter between Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin. Vincent wrote to his brother Theo that his drive to create was his life-line, or in our terms, the charging of his core batteries. 'My dear boy', he wrote, 'sometimes I know so well what I want. I can make do very well without God both in my life and in my painting, but I cannot, in spite of my sickness, exist without this thing which is bigger than myself, which is my life, and this is the power to create'.75 Vincent's drive to create which was his life and raison d'être was deflated by Paul Gauguin's brutal devaluation of Vincent's art. After this assault on Vincent's life-line against which he was seemingly defenceless, his life became meaningless, and he eventually committed suicide. A prime mode of recharging our participant core-vectors in prayer is an idea given expressed by Van Gogh invoking Psalms: Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come unto thee. Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. My heart is smitten and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread. (Psalms 102:1-4) My days are like a shadow that declineth, and I am withered like grass. (Psalms 102:11) But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations. ( 1 02 : 1 2) He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. (102: 17) I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.</page><page sequence="46">1 56 God as the Shadow of Man Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore, will I call upon him as long as I live. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell got hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou has delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. (116: 1-9) Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. (130: 1-6) Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. Prayers like these may lift us up by our own bootstraps and inject some grace, hope, and joy even in the midst of misery, depravity, and squalor. The prayers do not change the objective conditions, and they may change the way we perceive them and help us to cloak these squalid conditions with different meanings and values. As intensive and sincere prayer recharges our participant batteries, it may act as a catalyst for revelation and give us certitude in our normative stance and support in our affective attitudes; hence, it may also enhance our creative capacities. Here again is</page><page sequence="47">Epilogue and Overture 1 57 another instance of the symbiotic link between Tantalic revelation and Sisyphean creativity. The crucial point, however, is that each mythogene recharging our participant and séparant core-vectors is unique because it follows a unique experience or a quest. Consequently, the dialectic between the core-vectors, the Tantalus Ratio, is unique and so is the symbolon structure. Finally, the Promethean connection which is the culmination of all these uniquenesses is certainly unique. Indeed the bio-psycho-social configuration of life forms makes each creature statistically unique, and Pauli' s exclusion principle makes the fermion matter particles unique when all their measurable parameters are then taken into account. Why all these uniquenesses? We claim that the irreplicability of experiences and creatures is related to the necessity of our longings for our earlier developmental experiences - our childhood, our mother's grace, our past love - to be unrequited and for our dead beloved to be irreplaceable. There is no cloning or replication of our past experiences so that our quest for them will ever fuel our creative imagination. These are the meanings of myths which create unique gods, experiences, and creatures in their own unique image so that they will never be exactly recreated and our longing for them will be eternally unrequited. Evolution has perpetuated these uniquenesses as our prime movers so that Tantalus will never cease to chase his receding nourishment, Sisyphus will never stop pushing his stone up the hill, and Prometheus will be ever resurrected till the end of time, and all the three will thus effect unique revelations and acts of creativity ad infinitum. Hence, there will always be a gap, a disjuncture, an abyss between our longings and our quests and our ad hoc reality - a rift which ensures the continuity of our longings and quests and the revelation and creativity which they fuel. As we have already mentioned, the Ding-An-Sich the prime mover lies not in the separate vectors but in the dialectics between them. Only the interaction between the two provides the ontological energy of being. As we have seen, the kabbalist zivug, mating, is the mytho-empirical projection of this core dialectic as prime mover. Indeed, the agapic mating between the supernal countenances of father (in Hebrew Abba ) and mother (in Hebrew Ima) which also stand for the dialectics between grace and stern judgment is constant and provides the energy for the whole of creation.76 This is the TR, the raw energy. When structured into the symbolon structure and then invested into the creation of a Promethean Holon, the processes are ad hoc, depending on moods and needs. Hence the erotic mating of the lower countenances of the Kabbala: ze'er anpin (lower masculinity) and nukbeh (lower femininity) represent the processes of</page><page sequence="48">158 God as the Shadow of Man creativity whenever they take place.77 The TR provides the basic energy which is value-neutral, but in the symbolon structures and the actual processes of revelation and creativity, evaluation and normativeness are imminent. Revelation and creativity may be authentic or inauthentic; when a dialogue flows between an I-and-a-thou both may experience grace, but when the dialogue degenerates into an I-it petrification the other becomes my hell à la Sartre and vice-versa Indeed, the Kabbala envisages this theurgic tikkun, which we expound as a projection of creativity, as entirely within the value realm of man who may radiate grace or stern judgment. In our terminology, man has an indeterministic free choice to infuse himself with authentic revelation and, thence, to use it as a lever for authentic creativity, or to sink into the slumber and petrification of inauthenticity. Revelation, creativity, theurgic tikkun, and the mending of a blemished God are, indeed, some of the modes of mythogenic mediation, linkage, and connection, which is the subject of the following section of our present chapter. The Promethean Fire and the Burning Bush The process of mediation is the smuggling over the ontological, existential, and aggregate developmental barriers of both humans and energy-matter. Then the synapses between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter are linked by man as the anthropic connecting structure within which the elements of consciousness and energy-matter interact in a maieutic-Socratic manner. It should be stressed that man as the anthropic connecting structure obeys the laws of evolution. We hold that man had evolved to be what he is - as a function of his fitness to link between consciousness and energy-matter. Once a more efficient mediator evolves between the two, man would become extinct, or run around in zoos, like his predecessors in the tree of genetic transition. This could be linked to the fact that any barrier building behavior is shunned, proscribed, and punished. On the ontological level, the quest for non-being may take the form of a spiritual unio mysticia, and the longing for the perfect non-differentiation in perfect unity could effect a revelation by prayer, yet the wrong behavior would build up the barriers between history and transcendence. An apt illustration is in the Lurianic Kabbala, which describes sin as feeding the kelipot, or shells, which are literally the partitions between history and transcendence. However, one ought not to go to the other extreme of reverting back to non-being. This was one of the meanings of original sin, since the exposure involved (da 'at) in the knowing of transcendence might lead to the nihilation of the</page><page sequence="49">Epilogue and Overture 1 59 boundaried individual and his ability to mediate the primal dualities of universal consciousness and to the nullification of energy-matter. The existential barrier may be passed by an I-thou dialogue between two individuals, but the alternative I-it mutual petrification actually thickens the boundaries between human beings. Also, various substances, like alcohol and drugs, resorted to in order to achieve a smoother and easier rapport with one's environment, may eventually become a hindrance to dialogue since they give an illusion of concord and harmony, but actually twist the perception of objects and others and, hence, exacerbate the rift between the self and its human and objective surroundings. Finally, the social barrier may be overcome by authentic creativity which may give one a sense of freedom and fulfillment even in the confines of a normative mesh. Per contra, the ambitious social-climber, dominated by the expectations of the generalized other would find his isolation augmented the harder he tried to climb the achievement pyramid. Also, once he amasses power and wealth he is bound to feel more lonely amongst the hordes of lackeys, camp followers, and spongers who follow him only so long as he hands out positions and money. Since the aim of creativity is better to bridge between consciousness and matter, whatever is not authentically creative may boomerang back at a person or group and stifle, injure, or degenerate it. Authenticity in this context is creativity which is preceded by an inner revelation as to the most appropriate manner of creativity, which would lead to a sense of pure fulfillment free of the dictates of the generalized other. This, of course, is paradoxical. Yet precisely this paradox may lead to a more effective link between consciousness and matter since of the endless modes of individual creativities some would be more viable mediators than others among man, objects, and life forms. This is evolution on a primary interactive scale. Creativity and revelation are individual attributes, yet man the creator works in a group, in a society, which demands conformity to its rules lest it be injured or, in extreme cases, disintegrate. Here again we witness a paradox: The creative innovator who enhanced the well-being, development, and aesthetic pleasures of a society is usually suppressed, oppressed, and off-times ostracized by the very same society which benefits from his creativity. This may be related to a need of a group or a social or cultural system to guard itself against too great innovation, for which a society may not be ready, and which may hence rock the boat, shake its system-in-balance, and even disrupt it. This may be the reason for the Greeks' injunction against hübris, which may disrupt the contextual balance of society. Revelation may also be too extreme and, hence, be proscribed by the directional ethics like that of the Jews. We have already mentioned the celebrated apocryphal mishna of</page><page sequence="50">1 60 God as the Shadow of Man four who entered the mystical orchard. Of the four, one died, one lost his mind, and a third turned away from God. The password of a successful linkage between consciousness and matter is a balanced complementarity between revelation and creativity. The aim is to create self-sustaining connecting structures, the nature of which we shall examine in extenso in the following pages, to link the divergent dualities of consciousness and energy-matter. There is still no comprehensive theory on the link between consciousness and energy-matter on the quantum level, although there is a fair amount of consensus as to the existence of such a link. This may be contrasted with the plethora of attempts to bridge over the basic dualities of the macro world, e.g., Descartes's bridging over consciousness and the objects by the mediation of the good and truthful God, five hundred years of German philosophy trying to link between epistemology and ontology, and more recently the Existentialist striving to achieve dialogue with the other through one's inner-self. We hold this division between macro and micro worlds to be necessary and justified by their apparent nature and differences. Otherwise, some unwarranted hypotheses might be proffered. A recent exposition, for instance, trying to link mind and quantum mechanics advocates an isomorphism between quantum and macroscopic states, especially as far as superposition is concerned.78 Well, as Lockwood does not posit any limit to the macro-superposition state, it could encompass the whole universe and the observer.79 The world with all its galaxies and nebulae is, thus, dragged back from limbo into reality by a conscious act of observation. This, to us, is untenable. Superposition is an attribute of waves. Even if we take particles to be pockets of waves à la de Broglie and Schrodinger, then after they are structured in atoms, molecules, objects, and organisms Pauli's exclusion principle would not allow more than one fermion-matter particle (spin 1/2) in one state. Hence, these original wave packets (particles) are not likely to allow an instantaneous crowding in on them of masses by other wave packets competing for the same exclusive positions. For living organisms, this going in and out of superposition would entail death and resurrection. We hold, therefore, that superposition is an attribute of unbound waves of and the fuzzy quantum world. Thus, structured matter and organisms in the macro world cannot be subject to superposition. This view, incidentally is shared by Penrose,80 Lockwood's endorser. Moreover, we hold consciousness to be non-spatio-temporal; hence, it cannot be superposed. Finally, the isomorphization of the quantum and macro worlds ignores the uncertainty barrier which does not allow any direct observation of the superposed unstructured micro world behind it. Thus, we hypothesize a multiplicity</page><page sequence="51">Epilogue and Overture 1 6 1 of energy-matter states, ranging from the potential ain singularity, through the fuzzy unstructured, superposed quantum world and the atom, which is the structure unit of matter, to the molecule, objects, and life forms. Consciousness, on the other hand, is unique and unitary. Quantum theoreticians with their usual materialist, physical biases are trying to link consciousness to some measurable, observable, or quantum processes in the brain. Thus, Roger Penrose tries to explain such unity of consciousness by the quantum correlation phenomenon such as the particles flying in opposite directions in the EPR and Bell's inequality violation experiments. Penrose states: Quantum mechanics involves many highly intriguing and mysterious kinds of behavior. Not the least of these are the quantum correlations... which can occur over widely separated distances. It seems to me to be a definite possibility that such things could be playing an operative role over large regions of the brain. Might there be any relation between a state of awareness and a highly coherent quantum state in the brain? Is the 'oneness' or 'globality' that seems to be a feature of consciousness connected with this? It is somewhat tempting to believe so.81 Lockwood goes even further and cites the cases of patients whose corpus callosum had been severed and who consequently displayed two different streams of consciousness.82 This, as Lockwood himself noted, is not entirely accurate, because the Gestalt nature of the brain induces one hemisphere to develop or sublimate the functions of the other, with relative unity being regained through the unsevered brain stem. However, this to us is unnecessary. Penrose's query as to the source of the cognitive unity of consciousness is readily answered by us. We see it as stemming from the unity of the ani-consciousness, which is reflected indeterministically in the consciousnesses of all life forms and deterministically in the contained consciousnesses of all artifacts and objects. The differences between the cognitive perceptions of each life form are related to their specific bio-psycho-social configuration, which indeed renders their consciousness sui generis. In artifacts and art the contained consciousness varies according to the purpose, use, or message meant to be conveyed. As for Sperry's commissurotomic patients, even if their split mind does not rectify itself through the Gestalt functions of the hemispheres and brain stem, both minds reflect a single ani-consciousness. No one tries to belittle the functions of the brain since every mental and physical function is either generated or mediated by it,</page><page sequence="52">1 62 God as the Shadow of Man but the ani-consciousness which is a non-historical structure is integrated within the human personality in the manner described by us in chapter 1 . We have accepted Wheeler's dictum that observer and observed collaborate in the act of creation; he does not, however, elaborate on the dynamics of this partnership. We hold that Existentialism of the Kierkegaard-Buber dialogica variety does expound how the ani, the archetypal observer, interacts and initiates the processes of becoming. Buber postulates primary words which are spoken from the innermost being. Primary words signify a relationship. 'Primary words do not describe something that might exist independently of them, but being spoken, they bring about existence'.83 We hold that the primary word concept articulated by the anř-consciousness is a revelatory happening which structures the symbolon. The primary word spoken, not in isolation but, in intentional dialogue already entails a relationship, an I-thou, or an I-it. This fits our model, insofar as the TR structured within the symbolon contains within it an integration of ani-consciousness and energy-matter. Our atzmi, or interactive component of the self, is a conceptualization of one such integration. Hence, the speaking of a primary word integrates the I-thou of the ani and the I-it of the atzmi into a self-contained unit which stems from the self, but which is directed towards the object. It, thus, initiates the process of creation or, rather, provides a vectorial seed or tool of creation which is the essence of our connecting symbolon structure. 'And God said, Let there be light, and there was light'84 is, indeed, the speaking of a primary word-concept which forms a symbolon structure directed at creation and serving as a primary tool for it. The Mediation Most philosophers dealing with quantum mechanics refrain from postulating that the observer - by himself, or through the measuring instrument - actually creates the particle, presumably lest they be accused of metaphysical inclinations. Thus, Lockwood says, 'As a first approximation, one could think of awareness as a kind of searchlight sweeping around an inner landscape - literally inner: inside the mind. The searchlight may be thought of, in part, as revealing qualities that were already part of the landscape rather than as bringing these qualities into being'.85 In a similar vein, Dummet says, 'Our investigations bring into existence what was not there before, but what they bring into existence is not of our own making'.86</page><page sequence="53">Epilogue and Overture 1 63 We claim that the symbolon structure is of our making and so - through the measuring instrument - is the Eigenstate, the particle. We hold that the connecting symbolon structure is generated by a process of inner revelation. The vectorial intention of the symbolon is conscious, but the actual integration of the TR within it and its structuring is unconscious. The symbolon seed is utilized as a connecting or, rather, integrating agent between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter to catalyze the creation of a Promethean holon, be it the Eigenstate of a particle, a chanson, or a sculpture. In this matter, we agree with Churchland's claim: ...the world of inner sense, the world of sensations, and of thoughts, and of emotions, is... a constructed world. As with its access to the external world, the mind's access to itself is equally mediated by its own structural and conceptual contributions. It has access to itself only through its own self-representations.87 This, in a sense, would be what Foster calls 'mentalistic realism' according to which phenomenal qualities are self-revealing.88 However, our conception of the revelation which gives rise to the symbolon structure and the process of creation of the Promethean holon is sui generis and we propose to describe it in extenso. Historically, revelation was related to religious experiences, to the exposure of the individual to transcendence. For us, however, all these accounts of revelatory religious experiences have a mytho-empirical value because they constitute a mythological projection of core personality experiences. These are transmitted by the ani to the level of consciousness and to mythology, although the core personality processes are largely subconscious. Thus, although our empirical anchors in the present context are taken from belief systems, our aim will be to understand the revelations triggering creativity. Creative activity presumably displays dynamics similar to the revelatory processes underlying the exposure of the individual to his ani in the process of structuring the symbolon connecting agent. Indeed, we claim that mytho-empiricism is probably the sole method for gleaning information about the otherwise unfathomable dynamics of structuring the symbolon. The psychological basis for the quest of revelation is the participant vector's directive to the personality core to revert back to the Edenic pantheism of early orality and to the blissful omnipresence and self-sufficiency in utero. As these goals are unattainable, the revelatory processes allow their sublimation. But we believe in the conservation of psychic energy. Hence, the energy of the participant core-vector</page><page sequence="54">1 64 God as the Shadow of Man unexpended in the sublimatory process of revelation is projected mytho-empirically onto transcendence. The way to a participant revelation is a one-way journey into the inner self. This is also the irreversible direction of salvation because the pure ani without attributes is the manifestation of divinity. To seek revelation and redemption outside the self is, thus, not only ineffectual, but also sacrilegious according to some participatory belief systems. Indeed, for Kierkegaard the subjective inwardness constitutes the self-evident truth whereas the subject-object relationships are dependent on the mediation of inferences to uphold their shaky hypotheses. Kierkegaard proclaims, therefore, with the categorical finality of a preacher that 'God is a subject'. Authentic existence is, therefore, lonely, and Kierkegaard declares with his irrepressible irony, 'Let no one invite me, for I will not dance'.89 It takes two to tango, but, according to Kierkegaard, authentic being-in-the-world is a game of solitaire. The solitude of the individual is a unique loneliness because his inner core is linked by an umbilical cord to unity. Of this the individual can be aware of only if he turns inwardly to his pure ani. By prodding into his inner-self, man is revealed to truth and to God, which are synonymous. To this end, the outside, the objects, and the others are unnecessary and confounding and should be relegated by Occam's razor to the realms of superfluity. Tautologies are sometimes not only useful but necessary. 'I am, therefore, I am' is one such tautology. It points to the primacy of the existing self, whose awareness is not inferred from anything extraneous to itself. It rejects the Cartesian cognito, because in order to think one has to exist first, and therefore, existence does not have to be inferred. It manifests itself through the inner attributeless self which is the primary channel of awareness both of oneself and of one's surroundings. This pure self was theorized by Husserl and conceptualized by Heidegger as Dasein, which is the state of being in the world and knowing it.90 The Dasein man's being-in-the-word is uncovered (&lt; aufgedeckt ) by, and from, its very being and does not, or cannot be, inferred from anything else.91 Marcel also points out that the inner-self exists without the pure-self 92 : the Dasein is the Veritas transcendentalis, the transcendental and phenomenological truth.93 The unveiling, the disclosedness, the uncovering of being stems from the being-in-the-world itself and from a direct awareness of it without the mediation of logic or inference from human thought processes. Indeed, man's revelatory potential stems from this basic unveiling of the self by himself and to himself. The participant stance that all sense perception is illusive and that all truth stems from the inner sense of being which is the manifestation of the</page><page sequence="55">Epilogue and Overture 1 65 infinite and indivisible unity is projected, mutatis mutandis, in most monotheistic creeds and proclaimed, inter alia, in the first commandment of the Decalogue. The primacy of the self as a chip of divinity was expounded by the Neo-Platonists, adopted by mystics of most denominations, and developed as the anchor of a whole philosophical Weltanschauung by Kierkegaard. Heidegger reasserted the dasein as the expression of the 'I' about itself which is not itself a predicate, but the absolute subject.94 Niels Bohr, a lifelong Kierkegaardian, was motivated in his studies of physics to unearth his truthful inner-self. Heidegger's philosophy is central to contemporary Existentialist thinking; hence, it is useful to compare his conceptualization to ours. Heidegger's conception of dasein as the unveiling and disclosure of being, as the basic ontological truth which needs no further proof,95 is quite similar to the extreme participant pole of our personality continuum with its objectless pure-self (ani). This is the pole towards which the individual would move or yearn when his revelatory experiences are likely to manifest themselves. The séparant pole, however, where the interactive self (atzmi) is posited, anchors on logic and causality and would be quite amenable to the Cartesean cognito as proof of its existence. We do not, however, envisage an either/or alternative of either the dasein pure-self (ani) or the Cartesian cognito and the interactive self. In our model, both the inner-self and the interactive-self are part of the same continuum of being, though at opposing poles. This is where we differ from Heidegger and Descartes. Heidegger sees his dasein as being within space96 whereas our ani is the primary awareness of being without the attributes of space and time. Many of our mytho-empirical anchors are Gnostic and Kabbalist. These two disciplines are dualist and, hence, fit our basic conception of all creation as a perpetual interaction of the ani-consciousness and energy-matter through the mediation of symbolon structures. Our first mytho-empirical anchor is taken from Sha' arei ZedeĶ a thirteenth-century Spanish Kabbalist tract, which states that lower man and the 'higher man sitting on the divine throne'97 are both signified by the letter yod - this is the first of the Tetragrammaton and has the graphic shape of half a circle in Hebrew. These two yods, the two semi-circles, long to be united into a whole circle when lower and upper man are elevated to the Throne of Divinity. This could serve as a mytho-empirical anchor for the revelatory process of structuring the symbolon. The lower man representing the mortal human being is exposed to the upper man, who could signify the exposure to the inner ani-consciousness. This results in the integration of the two half circles into one. Translated into the conceptual context of our model, the interactive atzmi séparant vector</page><page sequence="56">1 66 God as the Shadow of Man is integrated with the ani participant vector into the TR which forms the contents of the subsequently structured symbolon. This symbolon then triggers the creation of the Promethean holon, be it a Christmas dinner or an Eigenstate of a particle. In a similar vein, the Gnostic Gospel of Philip speaks about truth and its image. 'Truth', it says, 'did not come into the world naked, but it came in types and images. It (the world) will not receive it in any other way. There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth. It is truly fitting to be reborn through the image. What is the resurrection and the image? It is fitting that it rise through the image' . 98 We claim that the truth here, for the fiercely participant Gnostics, stands for the attributeless, pure ani-consciousness. The created world of spatio-temporality cannot accept it in its nakedness. It needs a go-between, an image which we interpret mytho-empirically as being our mediating symbolon structure. In Gnosis, light, which with its participant bias would stand mytho-empirically for the ani and darkness, which represents the profane energy-matter, intermingle to create the world. In the theosophic Kabbala, the ten sefirot contain an image of God clothing himself, yet these sefirot are an integral part of the divinity, 'like the garment of the grasshopper whose clothing is part of itself." These are the mytho-empirical manifestations of named archetypes, which are both an inner ani-consciousness dynamic and coined denotations facing creation. These holonic manifestations also represent the initial formations of the symbolon structures. The sefirot are then structured into five countenances which are the mytho-empirical projection of full-fledged symbolon connecting structures. As we shall see later, the coupling interaction or intercourse of these countenances constitutes acts of creation. In our conceptualization, the countenances are symboloi connecting structures which produce the Promethean holon, the entire holonic product, creation, or artifact. According to the Kabbala, each life form and object has a transcendental root. This we could take to be a mytho-empirical projection of the symbolon structure as constituting the transcendental model or blueprint for creation. These roots constitute an integration of grace and stern judgment. Here again the participant bias of the Kabbala would conceive grace to be the projection of the ani-consciousness and stern judgment the projected profanity of energy-matter as represented by the interactive atzmi. The intermingling of sacred and profane elements in these Kabbalist roots is universal even at the risk of sacrilege. Thus, Moses had his root not only in Abel (grace), but also in Cain (stern judgment).</page><page sequence="57">Epilogue and Overture 1 67 The initial stages of the symbolon formation are within the ani-consciousness. It is an intra-psychic revelatory dynamic - a dialectic between the ahistorical, pure ani and the historical Tantalic participant vector within the historical self. Mytho-empirically, this could be found in the Kabbalist notion of the divinities, self-entertainment. This dynamic could be a projection of the individual's prodding into his inner-self for the structuring of the symbolon through the revelatory intercourse (zivug) with the ani, pure transcendental consciousness. The Kabbala conceived this revelatory process as a divine game of solitaire with the unitary God playing faute de mieux with himself.100 This divine game of solitaire resulted in the formation of the symbolon connecting structure. Mytho-empirically, this intra-psychic revelatory dialectic resulting in the formation of the symbolon is envisaged by the Kabbala as the process of creation, which started with God clothing himself in garments woven from the Torah and the letters of the Tetragrammaton. It is of crucial importance here to note that words and letters as intermediaries, i.e., as symboloi connecting structures between God and Creation were known in Jewish mysticism as early as Sefer-Yetzira (3rd to 6th century).101 The symbolon, which structures the TR within it, contains both participant ani-consciousness components and séparant energy-matter components. The main asset of the symbolon is that it integrates within it the ahistorical ani-consciousness and spatio-temporal energy-matter. Thence, it can serve as a synthetic seed for further creation. Since revelation is not communicable, the revelatory components of the Tantalic ani must interact with temporal energy-matter in order to be communicable and to serve as a trigger for further cycles of creativity. To sum up our present deliberations, we may envisage the revelatory intra-psychic dialectic as culminating in the structuring of the symbolon. The symbolon not only reveals what to do, i.e., lends meaning, but also how to do it and in which direction, i.e., lends value to the subsequent act. This when implemented in the act of creation will lend meaning and value to the created Promethean holon. The act of creation is, therefore, a dual process: an intra-psychic ontological dialectic leading to the formation of the symbolon and a subsequent epistemic process of creativity linking the ani-consciousness and energy-matter by the symbolon structure, thus creating the Promethean Holon. Schematically, this may be presented as follows (figure 3.10):</page><page sequence="58">1 68 God as the Shadow of Man Man, creature, or contained consciousness of artifacts /' ani- Tantalic Sisyphean energy- consciousness core-vector core-vector matter 3romethean Holon _____ ^ĻJ a Promethean _____ ' Creating a Promethean ' holon and imbuing Symbolon connecting values and meanings structure onto it Figure 3.10 In its center, the scheme presents the dual Tantalic and Sisyphean core-vectors of man as the most elaborate synthesis of the basic dualities of creation. Alternatively, it could also represent any other creature or artifact with contained consciousness, like our quantum measurement instrument. The intra-psychic revelatory dialectic structures the symbolon and with it creates meanings and values to be subsequently transmitted to the created Promethean holon. The actual act of creation is represented by the creative process linking the outer columns of the scheme. We may note that the two consecutive processes form a spiral which represents our basic dual processes of the symbolon structure formation and the Promethean holon creation. Before embarking on the actual process of creativity and, in our present context, the creation of the particle Eigenstate, let us examine the tool of the coupling creativity, i.e., the symbolon structure itself. The symbolon, being the contents of the relational process, constitutes the raw mixture of elements of the ani and the cognitive elements of the object-other embodied in the atzmi within the self. The essence of the symbolon is the first ontological manifestation of the togetherness of the interacting elements different from its initial components. In so doing, the various symboloi overcome the ontological, existential, and social barriers. This happens because the cognitive relationships between the</page><page sequence="59">Epilogue and Overture 1 69 elements of ani-consciousness and atzmi elements which contain cognitions of energy-matter may create cognitively meaningful links between transcendence and history; self, objects, and others and relate oneself as an individual to the demands of society. Apart from this relationship within the symbolon there cannot be any meaning and, indeed, there is not. The symbolon is, therefore, our prime mover as far as our being-in-the-world is concerned since the measurement relationship between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter actually creates the Eigenstate of a particle. The symbolon linking the 'I' and thou actually create the meaningful relationship between the self and its surroundings and the authentic revelation within oneself projected outwardly are the mythogenic symboloi linking the 'pure ani with transcendence'. Still, the symbolon is not operative as a linking agent without its existential structuring. Hence, the tool of passing barriers and the linking between the ani-consciousness and its physical and metaphysical surroundings is the symbolon structure. The Structure The content of the symbolon structure is the TR, i.e., the ani-consciousness as reflected in our participant core-vector interacting with the atzmi components of the séparant core-vectors of the self. These, when structured within the symbolon, would contain superimposed waves and/or virtual particles. However, at this stage we cannot offer a hypothesis as to how the ani and atzmi components of the TR actually interact within the symbolon structure. There was a time when brain researchers knew that there was a biochemical and electromagnetic interaction within the synapses between axons and dendrites of neurons, but did not know how the interrelationship and transfer of information actually took place. We are, by analogy, at a similar stage of knowledge - or rather ignorance - as to how the ani and atzmi actually interact and communicate within the symbolon structure. It may be that some spectacular advances in quantum mechanics and neuro-science will shed light on the basic interactions between consciousness and energy-matter within the symbolon structure. It is more likely that we shall never discover these basic dynamics because they are linked to the basic paradox of our being. This paradox relates to Ego's feeling and his realization that he was chosen to be the channel of awareness through his ani-consciousness, not only of his own being but also of the whole of creation. This makes for a solipsistic sense of being a unique and exclusive center of the cosmos. Schopenhauer admitted that one cannot argue with a solipsist but only</page><page sequence="60">1 70 God as the Shadow of Man send him to a madhouse. Surely, if the solipsist is willing to extricate himself from his quandary he may do so through our conception of an imperfect, ever-striving transcendence in the following manner. He should realize that the awareness of the ani is not his alone. The unique awareness perceived in his pure ani-consciousness - without interactional attributes - is a unity and, hence, common to all fauna and flora. Each lifeform, as well as Ego, feels this basic awareness through this unique bio-psycho-social configuration and, therefore, perceives this ani awareness in a kaleidoscopic manner specific to itself. This space-time kaleidoscope cuts off Ego from the other life forms and from the realization that the basic awareness in his pure ani-consciousness and transcendence are one. The immutable ani-consciousness peers through ever-changing configurations of life forms, artifacts and objects, and this combination of immutability and kaleidoscopically changing plurality makes for the uniqueness and irreplicability of each creature. Hence, the reflected historical ani in a specific self and the transcendental, pure ani-consciousness cannot be creative in unity: as Sisyphus has to have his stone in order to be creative, so Ego has to feel apart and separate from the transcendental ani for the interactive experience of creativity or, for that matter, for all experience, except for revelation, to take place. Hence, Ego is a partner of the transcendental ani in creativity. Mytho-empirically, we have the description of the Maggid of Meseritz following certain Kabbalist traditions according to which God contracted himself so that he could experience man's adventures vicariously through human cognition. 'The sages', says the Maggid, 'affect God through their mind; so that He thinks what they think. If they think in love, they bring God into the realm of love as stated in the Zohar. A King (God) is imprisoned in the tresses of the (human) mind'.102 The kaleidoscopic presence of divine unity in every object and life form is also apparent in the following passage from Plotinus: It is a common conception of human thought that a principle single in number and identical is everywhere present in its entirety, for it is an instinctive and universal truism that the divinity which dwells within each of us is single and identical in all.103 In Lurianic Kabbala, the doctrine that God is present in every life form and object is basic. 'There is nothing in the world,' says Vital, 'and in all the worlds and in all parts of creation; the inanimate plants, living and talking, that does not have in it sparks of divinity which are embedded in their profane shells.'104</page><page sequence="61">Epilogue and Overture 1 7 1 All creation, not only man, was thrown into spatio-temporality, and all flora, fauna, and inanimate objects are, in this respect, equal to man, with exiled cores of divinity encased in every created separatum and every vestige of spatio-temporality. Ibn Tabul describes this sequel to the breaking of the vessels as follows: 'And the reshimu of (Divine) light... was scattered within and amongst the (sinister) powers of judgment, and these were crystallized like containers which served as a body for a soul and, thus, a light particle is clothed by a (profane) container',105 Hence, each object and life form of creation is composed of divine particles embedded within containers of less sacred, and, in the lower spheres, downright profane, matter. The barrier between Ego and transcendence must be hermetically sealed; otherwise, the creative interaction between experientially different entities cannot be effected. Ego is, thus, interacting with a less than perfect transcendence which needs him for its feeling of creativity, yet cannot allow him to know that he is part of it. Ego is moved and motivated as we have seen by the dialectical quests of the TR, which are the things-in-themselves and, hence, part of transcendence. The longing for a perfect transcendence cannot and should not be realized, otherwise the seemingly all-important relationship between Ego and transcendence cannot be creative or even sustained. Hence, we have a double paradox: an imperfect transcendence makes for existence, creativity, and revelation whereas a perfect absolute transcendence, if achieved, is tantamount to nihilation and extinction of both transcendence and Ego. The possible solution of this paradox is that imperfection is perfect in the sense that it lends life and creativity to the dyad of Ego and transcendence, whereas the perfection of transcendence spells inertia, sterility, and the perfection of absolute death. However, we still have another paradox and this is the question of why the universal ani-consciousness chose a specific, atzmi historical, interactive self, such as a particular lump of energy matter or, in the author's case, a unique 95 kg. heap of flesh, bone, marrow, blood, and sinew, to be the seat of the awareness of the whole cosmos. This paradox seems to have no answer, and it may be that this is our metaphysical prime mover which keeps us ever looking, probing, and searching for the transcendental meanings of our existence, our origins before birth, and our destination after death. If the TR is our prime mover within our personality, the second paradox relating to the unexplained choice of our body as the channel of universal awareness and consciousness may be our transcendental prime mover. There could be no better illustration of our present premise than Roger Penrose's self-searching question as to why he wrote the book which we rely on in our present work. Penrose says:</page><page sequence="62">1 72 God as the Shadow of Man ...there is a simple bottom line reason for believing that consciousness must have some active effect even if this effect is not one of selective advantage. For why is it that beings like ourselves should sometimes be troubled - especially when probed on the matter-by questions about self? (I could almost say; 'Why are you reading this chapter?' or 'Why did I feel a strong desire to write a book on this topic in the first place?') It is hard to imagine that an entirely unconscious automaton should waste its time with such matters. Since conscious beings, on the other hand, do seem to act in this funny way from time to time, they are, thereby, behaving in a way that is different from the way that they would if not conscious - so consciousness has some active effect! Of course, there would be no problem about deliberately programming a computer to seem to behave in this ridiculous way (e.g., it could be programmed to go around muttering, 'Oh dear, what is the meaning of life? Why am I here? What on earth is this self that I feel?') But why should natural selection bother to favor such a race of individuals, when surely the relentless free market of the jungle should have rooted out such useless nonsense long ago!106 The answer to Penrose's query might well be the paradox which we have presented here; a paradox of a universal consciousness having chosen a specific body, mine (or Penrose's) through which to be aware of the whole of creation. This paradox may well provide Penrose's (and my own) motivation to probe into the relationships between consciousness and energy-matter. This paradox is exacerbated, or rather complemented, by the basic paradox of quantum mechanics: the duality of particles and waves which has fueled the efforts and imaginative questions of quantum physicists from Bohr to Wheeler, from Feynman to Everett, and from Böhm to Penrose. They and many others have tried to solve this paradox with apparent success only to realize that the vicissitudes of the paradox re-emerge again from unexpected angles and quarters. Our own work is no exception. We have tried to integrate this paradox using new tools and a hitherto untried frame of reference, yet here again, when all is said and done, a doubt sets in, and either we or somebody else, prodded by the ontological and metaphysical paradoxes which we have presented above as well as by the quantum mechanical paradox, will again try to solve these contrarieties by new methods and from new angles. This is the Sisyphean essence of all creative ventures. To sum up our deliberations on the symbolon structure, we might as well return to our spiral model linking the symbolon structure to the Promethean holon.</page><page sequence="63">Epilogue and Overture 1 73 Man, creature, or consciousness Of artifacts /' ani energy- consciousness ani atzmi matter p Ï Sv i î y s: i ® * * î ® « s? - - revelation Figure 3.11 The act of revelation created the symbolon and imbued it with contained consciousness. The symbolon is, thus, provided with a deterministic goal. The creation of a Promethean holon (PH) in the form of the quantum measuring instrument is an indeterministic decision by the human observer. However, once the instrument has been constructed, the deterministic task of the contained consciousness of the instrument is to create a PH in the form of a particle. It cannot innovate, improvise, or decide to measure. Its contained consciousness is strictly commissioned and deterministically programmed to perform preordained tasks. In this respect, there is no difference between a measuring instrument and the most sophisticated computers. Both are programmed by their contained consciousnesses to perform deterministically pre-ordained tasks. The human observer may conceive of another symbolon structure and then decide indeterministically to construct with it another PH, but as far as the previous PH is concerned, he is out of the game. He cannot have direct recourse to the micro quantum world; only the PH, the measuring instrument, can do thus. The human observer can decide to cut off the power to the measuring instrument or otherwise neutralize it, but this is another ball game, another symbolon structure. Man is ever-conceiving new symbolon structures. This characterizes more than anything else his mental functioning. Subsequently he will decide to implement only a few of these symboloi into Promethean holons. The creation of the symbolon structure is a participant dynamic and mostly unconscious; whereas the creation of the PH is a séparant process and mostly conscious. Thus, the creation of everything from a micro</page><page sequence="64">1 74 God as the Shadow of Man quantum mechanical Eigenstate of a particle to the twin towers of the New York Trade Center is an alternation between participant symboloi and séparant Promethean holons. This is the universal rhythms of revelation and creation. This is also our conception of complementarity, in contrast to the non-realistic disconnected probability and, at the same time, mechanistic complementarity of the Copenhagen interpretation. Mytho-empirically, this is projected by the Kabbala as the constant agapic mating of the two supernal countenances of Abba (father) and Ima (mother). The erotic mating of the lower countenances, ze ' er anpin (the lower masculine countenance) and nukbah (the lower feminine countenance), are not continuous but sporadic for ad hoc needs.107 This mytho-empirical mating represents the Kabbalist world of tikkun, the world of mending or of making whole. In our conceptualization, this would represent the processes of transition from the mental (agapic) structuring of the symbolon to the actual construction or (erotic) procreation of the PH by the seed of the symbolon structure. Indeed, the supernal mating between the Kabbalist upper countenances of Abba and Ima produces the da'at, the knowledge of revelatory grace. We hold that da' at represents the revelatory symbolon structure mytho-empirically. It is the shout of Eureka! when the parts of the model fall into place and when the design of the quantum measurement seems to us to be complete. The erotic mating between the lower countenances which we hold to be the actual creation of the PH is facilitated by the theurgic, mending efforts of man.108 This is the complete mytho-empirical dynamic of the revelatory formation of the symbolon structure and the creation of the PH through the mediating services of man. One important result of the complementarity between the supernal revelatory agapic mating and the lower erotic creative mating is that every life form and object must have a particle of divinity in it. Mandean Gnosis posits that the will of the Father (the Godhead) flows into every object and life form. The Kabbala postulates a panpsychism with particles of light present in all objects and life forms.109 Kordovero, the sixteenth-century Safedean Kabbalist, held that God is embedded in all creatures and all objects,110 and Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav declared that everything, animal and plant, contained a spark of divinity in its core. Buber's Existentialism envisaged a hidden thou in each life form and object, capable of being discovered by dialogue. This is the mytho-empirical projection of the presence of the reflection of the universal, pure ani-consciousness, integrated with energy-matter, in all life forms, artifacts, and objects. We may sum up our deliberations on the symboloi structures by pointing out that they can be conscious or subconscious and, thus, be in</page><page sequence="65">Epilogue and Overture 1 75 the realm of potential non-being. They constitute the ego-boundary formed around the self at the end of early orality to form an individual self, which is distinct from his objective and human surroundings and the ego-identity, which is the individual's normative structure vis-à-vis the social and normative structures. Once a link between consciousness and energy-matter between the inner-self and the outside objects and others, between the historical-self and transcendence, have been formed, it is subject to evolution, and the nascent symbolon structure is viable according to its ability to better link between the ani-consciousness and its human objective and metaphysical surroundings. Therefore, our conception of functionalism as related to structuralism is the aptitude of the symbolon structure to help the ani-consciousness better pass over its ontological, existentialist, and social barriers and link it to energy-matter. Man is the crown of creation so long as he is the best available creator of symboloi structures. Once a better (i.e., more functional) mediator evolves, man is sure to be dethroned. At this stage, however, man is the mediating agent between his psyche and the created work of art and the artifact as well as between the measurement instrument and the Eigenstate of a particle. Once the symbolon structure has been formed, it is fueled by the séparant quests and participant longings within its TR, but the transition from the potential of the symbolon structure to the act of creation takes place through an indeterministic act of intention. This intentionality, as we have mentioned earlier, lends meaning to our acts. This has been noted by Husserl and fits the vectorial teleology of our model. The transition from the thought to the word, from the Logos to the Act, has been admirably described by Goethe's Faust, as follows: It is written: 'In the beginning was the word'. Here am I baulked: who now can help afford? The Word? - impossible so high to rate it; And otherwise must I translate it, if by the Spirit I am truly taught. Then thus 'In the Beginning was the Thought' This first line let me weigh completely, lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly. Is it the thought which works, creates. 'In the Beginning was the Power', I read. Indeed? Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested, that I the sense may not have fairly tested. The Spirit aids me: Now I see the light. 'In the Beginning was the Act', I write.111 The evolution of a Faust progresses from the word, the core of a holistic idea, to the thought: the derivation of being from the Cartesian cognito. The power is the dialectical energy which is generated within the TR and which finally finds its outlet in the act, in the object manipulation of the atzmi. Indeed, there could be no better description of the flow of</page><page sequence="66">1 76 God as the Shadow of Man energy from the self to the object than this outward bound progression of the Faustian atzmi. In our conceptualization, the transition from the potential of the symbolon structure to the creative act is by an indeterministic intention which lends meaning, not only to the act but also, to the Promethean holon produced by the act of creation. This intentionality also reflects the unity of the ani-consciousness, which we hold to be at the basis of the experimentally observed unity of consciousness, as well as the unifying nature of perception.112 We also claim that our perception is then selectively directed by our indeterministic intention to choose from our surrounding energy-matter, objects, and life forms those items and patterns which fit the design of the symbolon structure for the construction of the Promethean holon. We have already pointed out that perception is biased by the bio-psycho-social configuration of each individual, but we now add a more basic bias of perception according to the vectorial contents of each symbolon structure. The selectivity of perception is an ad hoc dynamic determined by the intention to look for raw material for the construction of the Promethean holon as decreed by the symbolon structure. It might be useful to refer again to our spiral model as a visual aid for our explanation as to the relationship between the symbolon structure and the Promethean holon in the act of creation.

The link of the ani component of the symbolon structure with the pure ani is direct and instantaneous. The ani-component of the symbolon is just the reflection of the pure ani-consciousness. Both are ahistorical. Hence, there is no need for non-local pilot waves or tachion particles which fly faster than light to convey information from one particle to another in the EPR thought experiment and the Bell-Aspect inequality violation experiment. Distance, diachronicity, and locality are spatio-temporal dynamics, whereas the link between the ani component of the symbolon and the pure ani-consciousness (Buber's universal Thou) is synchronic, direct, and non-local, because both are manifestations of the same ahistorical entity. Moreover, our solution would not encounter special-relativity difficulties as other models do,113 because the communication through the ani-consciousness is instantaneous. The particles in the EPR thought experiment and the Bell and Aspect experiment were correlated before flying off to different directions and, thus, had the same ani component which further facilitated the instantaneous non-local communication between them. Yet, as Penrose rightly says,114 most if not all particles in creation are entangled and correlated. Hence, the possibility of instantaneous non-local communication through the ani-consciousness contained within these particles is universal. However, we should stress once more that this instantaneous communication is possible only on the quantum level and not on the classical level. There 'monads have no windows', to borrow Liebnitz' s enigmatic phrase again. We also exclude any ESP phenomena on the classical level as bases for the arguments in our present work. Per contra, the link between the atzmi component of the symbolon and energy-matter is elaborate and rather indirect. This might be related mytho-empirically to the link effected by the kabbalist or yashar (direct light) streaming from the Godhead, whereas or hozer (returning or refracted light) characterizes the dynamics of the lower sefirot (holonic rungs) and the world of creation, which is the mytho-empirical projection of energy-matter. The atzmi and energy-matter, both being spatio-temporal, obey the rule of the attraction of non-likes and the repelling of likes which prevails both in physics and in socio-personal relationships. This rule, which we have denoted as the least interest principle, operates in the manner we shall now outline. Most of our experience in deprivational interaction with our surroundings is negative, because of our basic séparant competitive</page><page sequence="68">1 78 God as the Shadow of Man orientation towards other human beings and our achievement-motivated efforts to control our environment. Such efforts usually fail because others also aim to control their environment, including the ego itself, and because the more one succeeds in one Sisyphean task the more one increases one's Sisyphean goals which, thus, become progressively unattainable. This is one of the main séparant mechanisms guarding against a too close rapprochement between the ego and its surrounding objects and life forms. However, the most effective séparant safeguard against participation is the least interest principle, which ordains that the more the ego strives to gain control over its surroundings or to gain possession of goods, power, and money, the less it is likely to succeed in its aims. The least interest principle operates on all levels of human behavior and may, therefore, be denoted as a meta-dynamic. It functions in a curvilinear relationship with séparant goals. Some achievement motivation is needed for the ego to muster all its energies to achieve its Sisyphean aims, but, at a certain intensity of motivation and effort, it becomes counterproductive. Beyond a certain level of exertion to achieve a séparant aim, the marginal returns decrease. The least interest principle operates, thus, as a negative feed-back cycle effecting a rupture between the ego and its goal whenever the efforts to attain it become too strenuous or frantic. Consequently, when the ego's attitude towards the achievement of séparant goals is almost neutral or nonchalant, it has the best chance of gaining them. The least interest principle operates in full force in the emotional relationship between the sexes115 and in power-based interaction in politics and business.116 Dialectics, as the unifying mechanism of existence, ordain that man can never achieve his Sisyphean quests and Tantalic longings but only a synthesis between them, which then serves as a thesis for another dialectical zig-zag ad infinitum. Consequently, man's fate is ever to seek something and always attain something else. This is masterfully portrayed by Beckett, whose Watt always longs to go north while his legs lead him southwards. The synthetic result of dialectics is the compromising middle range principle of the golden rule - or, the Greek, 'nothing in excess' - which was projected onto transcendence as the main principle governing both life and the heavenly bodies. Even the planets will be scourged by the Furies if they leave their ordained course. If one exceeds the middle course and one's moira, one commits the capital sin of hübris, punishable most strenuously by the Olympians. If one does not maneuver oneself skillfully between the extremes of Scylla and Charybdis, one is sure to perish.</page><page sequence="69">Epilogue and Overture 1 79 In physics the least interest principle is apparent in the attraction of nonlikes and the repelling of like ones in electromagnetic charges. It also operates in the short range of the strong nuclear force, which is just strong enough to offset the repelling force of the positively charged nucleus and in Pauli's exclusion principle, which does not allow Fermions of spin 1/2 to occupy more than one physical state. The dialectics between the repelling and attracting forces within the atom are responsible for its system-in-balance; otherwise, all matter would be squeezed back into singularities. To return to the interaction between the atzmi and energy-matter, in view of the least interest principle, which guards against successful participation in unity, marking the end of life and creation, the interaction must be indirect and maieutic in the following manner: The ani component of the symbolon structure ingrained in the measurement instrument of the double-slit experiment transmits to the ani component (the contained consciousness) of the photon emitting instrument that it intends to measure a particle. When the superimposed energy flowing into the physical system (double slits) comes into contact with the atzmi component of the symbolon structure contained within the measurement instrument (the particle counter) it serves only as a maieutic trigger which catalyzes the actual particle formation. This is so because the information (order, decision) to form the particle was already transmitted synchronically by the ani component contained in the measuring instrument to consciousness contained within the energy source (the photon gun the ani). The contact with the energy-matter component (the atzmi) of the symbolon structure triggers the emergence of a packet of energy from the superposition in the physical system into an Eigenstate of a particle. We have here a complementarity between the formation of a particle transmitted outside spatio-temporality through the synchronicity of the ani-consciousness, and the actual atzmi component of the symbolon structure embedded within the measurement instrument. The trigger could be effected by a local junction between a virtual particle or a resonant tangential junction stemming from the atzmi component of the symbolon structure embedded in the measurement instrument and the superposed energy within the physical system. Such a trigger is unobservable and also unhampered by the uncertainty barrier. This is our conception of the complementarity between consciousness and energy-matter in the formation of a particle in the double-slit experiment. Similar complementarities may explain the Bell inequality violation, as well as the transmission of the stunning force of a fifteenth-century Bosch painting to the author, who recently visited the Prado Museupi in Madrid.</page><page sequence="70">1 80 God as the Shadow of Man The Neoplatonic Plotinus envisaged that the creative transition from transcendental unity to the world soul, which contains the temporal created world, is mediated by the Nous , the cosmic intelligence.117 The Gnostic Gospel of Truth envisages the Father (Godhead) mingling with matter through the mediating services of the savior-messenger (Logos).118 We, however, hypothesize an intermingling of the transcendental ani-consciousness and energy-matter which already takes place in the mediating symbolon structure. Hence, it can trigger the Promethean holon which is the product created in its own image. The crucial point, however, is that the measurement act raises the quantum event to the classical level. Apparently this transition is effected by a quantum jump through the barrier dividing the classical and quantum worlds. This is the basic enigma of quantum mechanics. Roger Penrose's elegant mathematical formula linking the amplitudes of the time-evolving wave function (u) with the indeterministic act of measurement (R) is an immensely useful computation. It does not, alas, explain the processes represented by the mathematical formalism. We, however, try to explain this quantum jump over the boundary separating the quantum and classical worlds by a convergence of two processes: the instantaneous transmission of information by the ani-consciousness component of the symbolon structure contained within the measuring instrument, followed by a maieutic triggering of virtual particles and processes stemming from the séparant energy component of the symbolon structure which catalyzes the formation of the PH particle. The quantum jump is, thus, effected, not by a direct, local link, but by a maieutic trigger which algorithmizes - this is a preposterous expression, but it does describe the process - a particle out of the superimposed energy waves. This is an act of creation, ex nihilo. We do not accept the implication of Penrose's description of an orthogonal combination of states from which the measurement act chooses one which jumps into reality.119 Thus, the act of measurement creates - although maieutically and by means of an indirect trigger - the spin of a particle and the particle itself. The System-In-Balance Once the particle has been created, it requires a system, in, balance for its subsistence in its Eigenstate. If Roger Penrose is right, this system-in-balance is between quantum gravity and entropy.120 Even if Penrose is not right, then some other forces will prove to sustain the system-in-balance of the particle. This system-in-balance is universal and stems from the holonic duality of life forms and objects. We postulate that nuclei of atoms are held together by a system in balance</page><page sequence="71">Epilogue and Overture 1 8 1 between the strong nuclear force and the repelling force of the positive charges of the protons in the nucleus, that the electromagnetic force and Pauli' s exclusion principle hold the atom in a system-in-balance while gravity and the centrifugal force hold the solar system in-balance. Life forms, from the cell to the organism, are held in a system-in-balance by forces which we do not have the ability or the knowledge to examine. In chapter one, we showed how the human personality is held in a system-in-balance by its participant and séparant core-vectors. We hold that such a system-in-balance of objects and life forms is necessary for their space-time existence and evolutionary survival. It is reflected in our model of the system-in-balance of the symbolon structure between the . ani-consciousness and energy as well as in the holonic balance between the Tantalic and Sisyphean forces within the PH. If we return to the particle, so long as the system-in-balance holds, so does the particle. Once the balance is disrupted, the particle may decay into other particles or revert back to a superposed wave-like form. Following our method, we shall trace some of the mytho-empirical anchors for the necessity of a system-in-balance of both life forms and objects on all levels of existence. Any conspicuous difference between individuals and groups may lead to an increase in their mutual suspicions. Such differences reduce one's tendency to identify with others and make it easier to project guilt upon them in the form of social stigma. Thus, one of the most ancient sources of ethnocentrism lay in the perception of members of the outgroup not only as different, but actually as dangerous. Sumner tells us that 'each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior.. .and looks with contempt on the outsider... The Tupis called the Portuguese by a derisive epithet descriptive of birds which have feathers around their feet on account of their trousers'.121 The significant point, however, is not success, but rather conspicuousness. The Azande will proclaim persons who are deformed, ill-tempered, glum, or who behave in a bizarre manner to be witches. All these signs show their potential danger, and they are, therefore, stigmatized and ostracized.122 When Azande say that an action or feeling is bad, they mean that it is socially deplorable and condemned by public opinion. It is bad because it may lead to witchcraft and because it brings the offending person into greater or lesser disrepute. It is in the idiom of witchcraft that the Azande express moral rules which mostly lie outside criminal and civil law. The stigmatized person is outside the realm of the normative system of the tribe; he is a dog-like being whose huts may be burned and whose women and children destroyed with impunity.123 We mentioned earlier that the criteria for proclaiming a person a heretic in the</page><page sequence="72">1 82 God as the Shadow of Man Middle Ages were peculiarities of conversation, strange language, dress, manners, or unusual restraint in conduct. If a Jew is strangely attired, a black man has a strange family life and different sexual mores, if a foreigner acts queerly, or if an intellectual has strange and dangerous ideas, he is different and incomprehensible and, therefore, arouses anxiety. The stigmatizer cannot identify with them. They are 'not like us' and are, thus, suitable objects of the stigmatizer's projection and displacement mechanisms. For example, in the ancient tribal society of the Middle East, fratricide was among the worst crimes, since it undermined the basis of social organization - family relations. The bearer of the original Mark of Cain was not only damned by man; the land that he cultivated was cursed: 'When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be in the earth'. The pollution presumably stems from the identity of social norms and religious ones in ancient times. The offender acted against the divine order and was, therefore, considered a representation of evil. He, thus, became a source of moral pollution. Ranulf cites a seventeenth-century English Puritan sermon: 'Sinne leaves a kind of blemish and stain upon the soul after the commission of it... The Scripture calls it the excrement of naughtiness, though the act of sin is gone yet there is a blemish on the soul.. ..So a man after sin shall find himself dull to any good, and prone to any evil'.124 This is a perfect illustration of the symbolic value of the derogatory tag. This pollution was deemed to be contagious; the stigmatized offender was very often segregated and ostracized. Frazer cites instances of this stigmatized pollution.125 In ancient Attica, murderers were ostracized and outlawed, and anyone could injure or kill them with impunity. If another trial was pending against a murderer, he could return to defend himself, but he had to do so on board a boat, while the judges conducted the trial on the seashore. The murderer was not allowed to touch the shore lest he pollute the land and the people by contagion. Thucydides tells the story of Alcmeon, who wandered the earth after the murder of his mother; he had been told by the Oracle of Apollo that he would never find peace until he discovered some place which had not yet been in existence nor been seen by the sun at the time he slew his mother; only there could he settle; the rest of the earth was accursed to him.126 Thus, stigma and its social consequences historically preceded the normalization of sanction. Sanction was originally an expiatory act that was supposed to cleanse and purge the pollution and stigma incurred by the violation. Philological support for this premise is to be found in the origin of the word punishment ( peine in French, poena in Latin, and poine</page><page sequence="73">Epilogue and Overture 1 83 in Greek), which derive from the Sanskrit root PU, which means to cleanse, to purify. The crime offends the gods and pollutes the community; formal punishment cleanses the community of its pollution and, thus, appeases the gods. The phenomenon of stigma for violation of norms is almost universal. There are numerous examples in mythology, drama, and history. In Aeschylus' House of Atreus, the Oracle of Apollo instructs Orestes to avenge the blood of his father Agamemnon because the murderer has been cursed by the wrath of the gods. If the sin is not expiated by punishment, the whole community might suffer diseases and disasters.127 The Manteans of ancient Greece purified themselves after they met the murderers of Arcadia. The Kikuyu tribesmen in Kenya used to purify themselves after a chance meeting with a murderer; every chattel or object which came in contact with the murderer also had to be destroyed. The Chama Indians forbade the murderer to wave his hands, comb his hair, or dine with his fellow tribesmen, and in the hunting period he had to camp far away from the tents of the rest of the tribe.128 Another instance of stigmatization has been described in a study of the Amazon Indians. This is of special importance because until recently these tribes possessed a whole system of purification rites, the sole purpose of which was to cleanse the tribesmen from the polluting presence of a murderer or other offender against tribal taboos.129 In a primitive society, stigma in the form of taboo is the most prevalent sanction for non-normative behavior. Stigmas are applied to enforce dietary, familial, and sexual norms and to sanction rules pertaining to property, war, ghosts, religion, and group solidarity.130 Frazer cites many instances in which usurpers of the chiefs authority, unauthorized users of his property and clothes, and uninvited participants in his meals became taboo. Being declared taboo in a primitive society is the strongest sanction imaginable, sometimes tantamount to a death sentence. Frazer' s examples include a New Zealand native who died of painful convulsions after becoming taboo for eating his chiefs food and a Maori chiefs tinder-box that actually killed several persons who lit their pipes from it because they died of fright on learning to whom it belonged. Death from taboo, although induced by shock from imaginary fear, is a potent reinforcement to the norm. For the savage, taboo is not a spiritual or intangible entity; for him it is, to quote Frazer, 'as real as gravity and may kill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid'. It is not only the anthropomorphic Greek gods or primitive tribes who punish man's disruption of the system-in-balance severely. Lurianic Kabbala sees original sin as inherent in Adam's hübris, as expressed by his over-eagerness to copulate with Eve. He disrupted the cosmic</page><page sequence="74">1 84 God as the Shadow of Man system-in-balance by carrying out his mating zivug before the Sabbath - an optimal time for a zivug of mending, tikkun. In addition, he performed a disrupting and polluting mating with Lilith-Satan's consort, thereby, bringing about the profane zivug of Eve with the snake.131 In a like manner, Moses also committed hübris by striking the rock, instead of talking to it as ordained by God, in order to free the water within. Moses, thus, also caused a disrupting zivug instead of a harmonious one.132 The fiercest excesses and their ruthless punishment are found in Amos chapter 6:1-14: 1 .Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came! 2.Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to He'math the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? 3. Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; 4.That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall; 5. That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; 6. That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. 7 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed. 8. The Lord God hath sworn by himself, saith the Lord the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. 9. And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 10. And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burnetii him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord</page><page sequence="75">Epilogue and Overture 1 85 1 1 .For, behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts. 12. Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgement into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock: 13. Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 14. But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of He' math unto the river of the wilderness.133 We have here the luxurious excesses of hedonism, the hübris of assuming to be like King David, God's abhorrence of the hübristic excesses of Israel, and his smiting of those who falsely claimed to have vigor (horns). The hübris of pride, indeed, disrupts man-transcendence relationships. Hence, 'everyone that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord[...]he shall not be unpunished.'134 We have already pointed out that the breaking of the vessels was a violent disruption of the system-in-balance of the Godhead, whereas original sin and the golden calf represented dramatic disruptions in the process of his mending. Indeed, man's system-in-balance on all three levels of his being - biological, personal and social - is very precarious. In The Myth of Tantalus , we discussed the vulnerability of the Sisyphean and Tantalic types to outside stimuli. On the cortical level, the activist Sisyphean needs the initial arousal more than the Tantalic type in order to initiate his functioning. On the personality level, the Tantalic type is averse to stimuli, whereas the Sisyphean is hungry for them. On the social level, the Sisyphean is a group performer, whereas the Tantalic type is a loner.135 These traits, as measured along continua, can be used to indicate the vulnerability of the various types to the disruption of the system-in-balance on these three levels which are, of course, interrelated within the individual as a holistic unit. When one of these levels, or the whole person, is exposed to a traumatic experience, they try to mend themselves on another level of being. However, when these tikkunim are not successful, the individual may die, become insane, or become alienated. There is no intrinsic difference between the vulnerability of the system-in-balance of man or of God. Both have to be mended if their inner equilibrium has been disrupted. This makes for constant change, both in man and God. Both mortal and divine are in a constant process of</page><page sequence="76">1 86 God as the Shadow of Man becoming. They undergo processes, but, in line with their Tantalic and Sisyphean meta-myths, they never reach their goals. A system-in-balance also constitutes a prerequisite for revelation and creativity. Revelation can flow through a balanced infrastructure and then be transmitted to others and to God as a universal thou. Man, through his creativity, is also the connecting link between the mindless, valueless demiurgos and the powerless and silent Godhead. Man creates the viable equilibrium between psyche and soma, between God and his creation. There can be no abdication for a creative Sisyphus; without him everything reverts to chaos. The Spiral The act of creation brings us back to our original spiral. The symbolon structure is the structured operational containment of the Tantalus Ratio (TR), which in turn is the prime moving dialectic between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter. As we have seen, this symbolon structure triggers the creation of the particle as a Promethean holon (PH). We have seen that although the PH could be any artifact or life form, in all cases the holonic dynamics of creation are similar. Yet the spiral does not stop there. We have seen that the participant longing and séparant quests inherent in our prime moving TR can never be achieved, so where, then, does this non-expended vectorial energy move to. We hold that after the act of creation the vectorial non-expended energy inherent in the TR is projected onto transcendence as séparant myths of experience and participant myths of longing. These in turn refuel the batteries of the TR, which has been deflated, which then invests its energies into more symboloi structures which trigger the creation of PHs, da capo. Graphically, our spiral would then look as follows: Figure 3.13</page><page sequence="77">Epilogue and Overture 1 87 Our scheme, thus, presents the whole dynamic progression from the TR as prime mover, its structuring within a symbolon to its maieutic triggering of a PH. Since the continuum of these Tantalic and Sisyphean myths - the projection of which is generated by the unachievable goals of our core-vectors - corresponds to the participant and séparant dualities of the TR, the symbolon structure. Then, mytho-empirically and even etymologically, this duality is apparent from the Greek and Hebrew words for the world. In Greek, it is cosmos, i.e. order, the séparant arrangement of objects and life forms in a pre-determined scheme. In contrast, the Hebrew word for world is olam, which is related to healem, the clandestine nothingness, representing participant wholeness. This is related to our core continuum, ranging from séparant being to participant nothingness. Tantalio longing M participant ^ séparant ► Séparant quest Figure 3.14 The recharging of our participant core vectors by Tantalic myths of revelation would correspond mytho-empirically to the Kabbalist hessed, the Gnostic ogdoad and the Buberian universal Thou. In Eastern creeds, this would have its equivalent in the mandala and other revelatory mythologenes. The séparant recharging of batteries would be by Sisyphean mytholegenes ranging from the Greek archetypal anthropomorphic gods through the Germanic war gods to the contemporary American myths of the superman, the cowboy, Horatio Alger and his rise from rags-to-riches. The participant mythological recharging of our ani core vectors make for a mytho-empirical projection of our ani-consciousness as a particle of divinity. In fact, the mytho-empirical projection of our ani core- vector as part of divinity makes our TR an initial link between transcendence and history. The dialectical quests of the TR are both in history and outside it. The fact that</page><page sequence="78">1 88 God as the Shadow of Man my body has been chosen to be the channel for transcendence is the initial metaphysical factor which motivates our transcendental quests. This is the insoluble riddle which leads us to turn to God for answers. 'Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?', asks Isaac, and Abraham answers, 'God will himself provide for a burnt offering'.136 But he does not. Isaac is offered as a burnt whole, and the sacrificial Isaac syndrome actually provides the basis for morals and normativeness, both for man and transcendence. The link between the transcendental thing-in-itself and the prime mover in history is provided by revelation. Transcendence is revealed to history through exposure and the flow of grace. The participant giving of transcendence is supplemented and complemented by séparant receiving. The myths of participation are myths of yearning, of our ani-consciousness's core-vector, and, hence, are also expressed in theological mythologies of the Godhead. The myths of experience are projections of the prime movers of the demiurgical quests of possession and power. The Tantalic mythologies, thus, fuel our primal dialectical yearning, while the séparant mythologies project myths of man's development as well as of cosmogony. Hence, both man and God are in a constant process of becoming linked to the dialectics between Tantalic myths of yearning and Sisyphean myths of experience generating the signs of language and the symbols of religion. The demiurgos is the God of creation and of history, of space and of atomic energy. He is the divine container of the Kabbala receiving the flow of the light of grace from the Godhead. The demiurgos interact with the Godhead through creativity to produce creation. Sisyphus, thus, imbues his stone with grace, and the inert Godhead is able to vicariously experience the authentic triumphs and disasters of a Mozart, a Van Gogh, or a Brel. Existentially inauthentic creativity, which is unpalatable to him, is left to the demiurge as Gnostic error or Kabbalist din and kellipot. Creativity, if authentic, may generate the energy for an I-thou dialogue, linking the Godhead (the universal thou) and creation. If inauthentic, flawed creativity would degenerate into the petrification of an I-it relationship. The Gnostic messenger, the Kabbalist initiate performing the tikkun, the mending, the go-between of revelation, links the thing-in-itself of transcendence with the prime mover emanated into history. This is why Tantalus the protagonist of our meta-myth is a Titan: part god who is still in transcendence and part man; he is God's image and émanant theophany within history. The dialogic prayer between the self in history and the transcendental universal thou actually generates the energy of revelation. It is the process of revelation in itself without any further goal beyond it.</page><page sequence="79">Epilogue and Overture 1 89 Revelatory prayer is God. Sisyphus, likewise, is the creative link between the Godhead and the demiurgos. He symbolizes the integration between man's desperate creative spirit and the demiurgical stone which is both his burden and his destiny. The Descent into History The most formidable barrier is the ontological one between being and nothingness, since whatever is on the side of non-being stems from and longs to revert to metaphysics. The mediation between transcendence and history preceded Christianity. In India, the avatara signifies a descent of a God into history. Vishnu, for example, as an avatara, assumed many forms, both human and non-human. There would, indeed, be mediating agents between temporality and transcendence. When in history the avatara serves as such an independent connecting structure it has been self-regulating and equal in significance. Since the linking function involves the structured mixture within itself of both connected elements, the connecting structure has a dual nature, temporal and divine. Developmentally, early oral non-differentiation would make for the linkage in a single consciousness as the arena, a nascent-self, and a residual outside transcendence. Hence, a universal pure-self would be anchored onto pantheistic early orality. The plurality of objects crystallized at later orality would, therefore, be conceived as subsequent to, and stemming from, the unity of early orality. The mytho-empirical primary mediator between unity and plurality would be the Son of God, the Kabbalist adam kadmon, or the son of man which in Christianity is embodied in Jesus Christ. There are many instances of a man-God mediating between history and transcendence, but the figure of Christ predominates. The mediation of the man-God creates a trinity, the most common mode of linkage between two divergent entities. Jung examines the psychological sources of the trinity and starts with the Pythagorean assertion as to the perfection of the number three. 'One is the first from which all other numbers arise, and in which the opposite qualities of numbers, the odd and the even, must therefore be united; two is the first even number; three is the first that is uneven and perfect, because in it we find beginning, middle, and end'.137 Indeed, if dialectics is as potent and all-inclusive as it seems to be, the third is the synthesis resulting from the interaction between the first and the second. In our context, a trinity stands for the basic procreative triad of the father, mother, and child. The Christian Trinity has the Holy Ghost instead of the mother, because of Christianity's overt aversion to sex, which we have explored elsewhere. Feuerbach, for instance, states:</page><page sequence="80">1 90 God as the Shadow of Man It is true that the Virgin was not so placed between the Father and Son as to imply that the Father had begotten the Son through her, because the sexual relation was regarded by the Christians as something unholy and sinful. But it is enough that the maternal principle, the Holy Ghost, was associated with the Father and Son.138 Not so in other creeds and mythologies, which sanctify the trinity of the archetypal nuclear family. Some representative examples are the Egyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus and the Greek triad of Zeus, Semeie, and Dionysus. Our concern, however, is the triadic nuclear family, as projected on transcendence, with the divine siblings having a religio-normative status of their own vis-à-vis the created world and human society. This relates, naturally, to our third phase of separation where the adolescent offspring are pushed out of the protective family fold by means of some rite of passage to bear the burdens of social responsibility. Such placement within the mesh of the normative system of society has been dealt with by us through the Isaac Syndrome,139 with the positing of the offering of Isaac as a mytho-empirical anchor for the normative separation of adolescents from the forgiving protection of the family. Both Isaac and Jesus had been willing normative victims of the authoritarian séparant mandates of the archetypal father. In a similar vein, Iphigenia was a willing victim to the normative, patriotic mandates of Greece as imposed by her authoritarian father Agamemnon. All had been mytho-empirical normative sacrifices, symbolizing the harnessing of the young into their séparant social burdens. Here we near the séparant extreme of our continuum of gods: The son/daughter are normative success stories because they willingly sacrifice themselves to the normative standards of their society through the authoritarian services of the father and are projected on transcendence as séparant sun-gods and martyred redeemers. This trinitarian system is a clear séparant development introducing plurality into Christian theism. The Council of Nicaea rejected the Arian doctrine of the Son being created by the Father and, hence, subordinate to him, instead adopting the Athanasian doctrine of consubstantiality of three separate divine persons. This separation is the metaphysical projection of the surrogate sacrifice parent pushing out the pubescent young into the trials of societal strife, whereas the triunite formula is the transcendental expression of the young adult's participant quest to return to the cushioned forgiveness of the family fold. Our interpretation of this basic Christian dogma as a transcendental projection of the socio-normative separation of young adult male children and their ejection into the normative loneliness of responsibility for their</page><page sequence="81">Epilogue and Overture 1 9 1 own deeds and life explains its otherwise absurd logical inner contradictions. The Athanasian formula, sanctified by the Council of Nicaea, stresses the distinctness and separateness of the three divine persons. They are distinct selves: 'The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God'.140 This separate distinctiveness is then merged into unity: 'And yet', continues the Athanasian doctrine, 'there cannot be three Gods but one God'.141 No amount of scholastic hair-splitting could evade this logical contradiction, despite attempts to explain its viability over the centuries. It may, indeed, be explained by its intra-psychic reinforcement of the normatively ejected adult, trying to regain the togetherness within the fold of the archetypal triad of the nuclear family. It is a longing for unity in a trinity, which comes only as a metaphysical projection of the lonely adult's yearning for his lost cushioned forgiveness in his pre-adolescent family. The self-sacrifices of Isaac and Jesus had been to assert the authority of the father, as representing the normative structure of society. The purpose of divine legitimation of this paternal authority has been its imputation to God the Father. Christ himself asserts that 'the Father is greater than I'. The father commands and the son obeys. We have mentioned in an earlier chapter that the interpreters of the myth of the offering of Isaac claim that he bound himself to the altar.142 This to us symbolizes the self-enclosing of the obedient son to the separating social norms promulgated by the archetypal father. Both Isaac and Christ were active partners to their normative sacrifice. Jesus carried his own cross and Isaac carried the wood for his sacrifice on his shoulders, forming a cross, with his own body. This is a mytho-empirical account of successful séparant socialization. Isaac was believed to have been sacrificed and then resurrected so that the myth of his offering also parallels the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. The implication is that when the Son of Man sacrifices himself willingly to the paternal normative mandates of society he is projected on transcendence as a Son of God. Everyone in human society has undergone some rites of passage or other from childhood to adulthood. The surrogate sacrificial processes make for a strong identification with the archetypal suffering Son of Man, especially when he is projected ultimately as a Son of God. A paternal victim who becomes God is the strongest possible model for identification for a struggling adult, who has been pushed to paternal authority from the family fold to 'become a man', a responsible citizen/subject/party member in a depriving, competitive, cut-throat society. This is reinforced by the victimized son of man becoming a</page><page sequence="82">1 92 God as the Shadow of Man separantly omnipotent son of God, who can at will manipulate his objective human environment. The importance of this premise, which is beyond the scope of the present work, is that the surrogate sacrificial rites of passage from childhood to adulthood serve as a major dynamic for the reinforcement of social norms in adolescents and young adults. We have already pointed out elsewhere that the Freudian Oedipal aggressiveness of children towards their parents and its resolution is a necessary, but not sufficient, dynamic for the acquisition of morality. Such an Isaac syndrome is the supplementary dynamic of implanting social norms in the young and their enmeshing into the normative system of society.143 Indeed, by his suffering, Christ became normatively pure.144 His victimization was instrumental in his promulgation of a higher code of social norms and the announcement of ideals for human behavior. He also decreed through his sacrifice (and in like manner through the archetypal offering of Isaac) the need to obey social norms as invested by paternal authority and his own mandate to judge others through the authority of God the Father and his church.145 This most séparant power, to pass judgment on the world, has been relegated by the Father to the Son so that he may proclaim the Kingdom of God on earth. This kingdom is the séparant active control of God of all human affairs. The direct manipulation of all life forms, man and objects is relegated to Jesus through the reign of God the Father.146 These are the wildest dreams of the séparant type come true. The obedient Son has gained not only the vicarious, but the direct, authority of the father to impose his commands and mandates over his objective surroundings and life forms. The normative system which has been implanted in the Son by rites of passage and surrogate sacrifices is imposed by the conformist Son with divine paternal authority. With the proclamation of the Kingdom of God through the Son, the object-manipulative goals of the séparant core personality vector have achieved their projective fulfillment. However, the price for this séparant omnipotence is complete conformity - perinde ac cadaver , i.e., 'obey like a corpse', as the Jesuits put it. One has to surrender completely to the authority of the Messiah-King 'for his sake' and to be worthy of him.147 The séparant authoritarian cycle now becomes clear: become a willing victim to paternal authority as manifest by the normative structure of society, and its institutions permit one to demand obedience from others. Hence, all absolutist rulers reigned not with grace, but through the projected séparant tyranny of God. Indeed, Kabbalistic authority stems from vile stern-judgments and not from divine grace.</page><page sequence="83">Epilogue and Overture 1 93 One step further from the deification of a son who complies with paternal authority is the beautification of the normative system as a whole, which is the expansion of the authority of the archetypal father and its relegation to the whole body of societal laws and mandates. This makes for the enshrined status of legal systems among lawyers and law-makers. When God is dead or absent, the law becomes God. The original Indian avatara was a god who descended {ava means 'down') into history; his parallels in other religions were mortals who became gods. Surely, these opposite directions of linking history and transcendence have theological significance, but for our present purposes this is secondary, since we are mainly concerned with the function of linkage itself and not whether it was initiated in history or transcendence. St. Mark co-opts Elias and Moses to Jesus as divine mediators, but singles out the latter as the beloved son of God.148 Also, Jesus saw himself as a door or a linking structure through which one may enter and be saved in the ever-after.149 Jesus is the image, the refraction into history of the abstract invisible God. He is the archetypal model, the avataric blueprint for every creature.150 He is the potential, as the primary symbolon structure for the creation of everything.151 Still, Jesus saw himself as the Son of man.152 This could mean the elevation of a human, like Enoch and Elijah, to the throne of God or the sanctification of martyrs like Isaac and Jesus, who achieved divine status by taking upon themselves the sins of others - Isaac of Israel and Jesus of humanity as a whole. Another possibility is that Jesus, or rather his followers, saw in him the ideal man in the Platonic sense, which endowed him with the perfection of the Platonic idea from which all humanity has been fashioned. The importance of this view of Jesus for our context is its effort to pierce the veil between history and transcendence by devising anthropocentric means to reach out to the perfection of holiness. Also, the second coming of Christ is a truly avataric event, since Christ, who has become God, appears on earth, and would, thus, be recrossing the border from transcendence to history, so that the barrier between being and non-being is traversed back and forth. However, the Eucharist, a partaking of the body and the blood of Christ, is a ritual crossing over to transcendence by means of ingesting the divine substance of a man who became God, and re-enacting thereby the transition of Christ from here to eternity. The essence of Christ as the prime mediator between history and transcendence is extended to whoever believes in him.153 Christ, then, is a kind of universal exchange. Whoever plugs into him will experience a revelatory crossing of the barrier in the way that Jesus himself did. Hence, according to St. John, to believe in Christ is to shed off the temporal fetters and partake in eternity, while still in the here-and-now.</page><page sequence="84">1 94 God as the Shadow of Man In Jewish tradition, we have the interpretation of Goldzieher and Popper that Abraham was a Titan (an interpretation stemming from the etymology of his Hebrew name Av Ram ) and, thus, linked by mythogenic structures between history and transcendence.154 God appoints a servant - an elect who will be imbued with his spirit and bring forth judgment to the nations.155 This again is a linkage, an avataric theophany of God within history. Moses was the mediator between the children of Israel and God, since he spoke to them through Moses. The adam kadmon (Lekhol kedumim), the primeval anthropos was the mediating agent according to Lurianic Kabbala between God and his creation. Job says, 'In my flesh shall I see God'.156 This is a mediating struggle which is initiated in a diametrically opposite direction to the avataric descent into history and to the* dictum of St. John, 'that the word (the Logos) was made flesh, and dwelt among us'.157 It is more in line with the Lurianic Kabbala' s doctrine, that sparks of divinity are imbedded in every creature. However, the end result is really a link between history and transcendence, irrespective of whether the connection was initialed in the former or the latter. Likewise, the Neoplatonic doctrine of Plotinus postulates an intermediate entity which he called vous , the intellect, which was the ahistoric structure containing the Platonic forms - ideas, which connected between the transcendental abstract one and the individual soul. The Hasidic tzaddik was also a go-between for the Holy Presence and the community. In the various Gnostic sects, we have the intermediary messenger which links the profane creation and pure 'righteous alien God'. Thus, in Mandean Gnosis, the go-between is 'manda Hayé' the messenger of Kushta - truth. In the second-century texts of Poi-mandres of Hermes Trismegistus, the vous is the father from which emanates the word 'Logos', and then the mind-artificer (nous-demiurgos). These two intermediaries lead to primal man (anthropos).158 In Valentinian Gnosis, christos is the icon which may pass through the horos : the barrier between the Pleroma and the Cosmos and harmonize them.159 Krishna, being the avatara, the temporal incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu, is the divine messenger sent down to earth to reveal to humans the way to abandon the profane pleasures and turn to divine enlightenment. In Egypt ma'at, the concept of truth is an avataric descent of cosmic transcendental origin to endow harmony and justice to the created world and its creatures.160 Also, the Pharaoh was worshipped as the God Horus and, thus, was the link to transcendence and the ever-after since when the Pharaoh Horus died he became the God Osiris, Lord of the West, the realm of the dead. The function of primal man in connecting history and transcendence was of the nature of a complementarity since, on the one hand, he was created in the image of God,161 and, on the other hand this imago dei is reflected in</page><page sequence="85">Epilogue and Overture 1 95 all human individuals, although every human being is different from every other.162 Hence, within man as the prime symbolon structure there is a complementary interaction which complements and unites the here-and-now and the ever after. Indeed, the Midrash specifies that man was both created from supernatural and earthly elements so that the barrier between being and transcendence was traversed by the creation of man.163 We have already mentioned that God used the Torah as a prime tool for the creation of the world. Hence, whatever mediating function between time and eternity is effected by the avataras, sons of God and Jesus Christ is carried out in Judaism by the Torah. It befits the abstract nature of the Judaic God, since the abstract Logos is an apt mediator- between God and history. The Torah also lends its traversing powers to its temporal abode, the Ark of the Covenant, the Tabernacle, and to the Temple itself. Indeed, God instructs Moses that the communication between them shall take place from the Ark of the Covenant: 'And there will I meet with thee', says God, 'and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel'.164 Man expects reciprocity from God. He assumes that his efforts to cross the barrier towards transcendence will be met by a corresponding approach from God. Hence, God's sacrifice of his son to save humanity is an apt response, especially if we are to accept the hermeneutic of Kierkegaard to the effect that the sacrifice of Christ is continuous and takes place in a continuous present. Also, the Indian avatara is expected to remain in the here-and-now until his task is completed. Man may also strive to cross the border of transcendence in order to 'mend' (the kabbalistic/Hasidic tikkun) a blemished God. Christ is by definition a blemished God, yet his suffering is mostly regarded as a means for identification with Him, so that whoever empathizes with him will believe in Him and be saved. Not so Lurianic Kabbala. We have mentioned previously and elsewhere165 that the cosmic catastrophe of the breaking of the vessels was due to the inability of God to prevent it. Hence, God is less than perfect. Thence, the task of the Kabbalist and the Hasid is to effect a tikkun , a mending of God by collecting the particles of divinity, which have been strewn in the mires of profanity and lift them back to their sacred source. This lends meaning to the life of man. He is not just a subject of a perfect God to whom he has to pay daily homage and flatter him from time to time, but he is a partner, albeit a junior one, to divinity by helping to cure its blemishes and ineptitudes. Likewise, Horus and Orisis are mutilated, losing their eyes, so that the mending and restoring of their eyes is of</page><page sequence="86">1 96 God as the Shadow of Man prime importance in the eschatological Egyptian religion: the righteousness of those who wish to pass safely to the barrier of the ever-after in the west is measured by the ability of their good deeds to restore the blemished limbs of the gods. This is aptly phrased in the following spell from the Egyptian Book of the Dead : The plume is stuck into the shoulder of Osiris, the Red Crown shines in the bowl, the Eye is eaten and he who sought it is fetched. I know it, for I have been initiated into it by the Sem-priest, and I have never spoken nor made repetition to the gods. I have come on an errand for Re in order to cause the plume to grow into the shoulder of Osiris, to make complete the Red Crown in the bowl and to pacify the Eye for him who numbered it. I have entered as a Power because of what I know, I have not spoken to men, I have not repeated what was said. Hail to you, souls of Hermopolis! Know that Re desires the plume which grows and the Red Crown which is complete at this temple, and rejoice at the allotting of what is to be allotted.166 Indeed, the task of the dead passing over to the realm of Osiris on a theurgic mission for Re, the sun god and chief deity, is to repair the crown of Osiris and cure his blemished eye as well as to cause the plume to re-grow on his shoulder. The essence of the mending of a blemished god is that man, by his righteous deeds, theurgically transmits the restoring energies and grace with which the divinity may make himself whole again. The feeling of pain of a suffering god like Christ on the cross induces man to empathize with him and generate grace with which to restore him. This grace, which is formed in man and flows towards a needy transcendence, creates a symbiotic relationship between man and God and effects a reciprocal flow of grace through the barrier of non-being. This is the meaning of the dictum of the Zohar that man's deeds should be for the theurgic unification, or rather the coupling, of God and his Holy presence. In Hasidism, this mending is effected within the consciousness of man. God the king says that the Maggid of Meseritz following the tikkun ei hazohar 'is imprisoned within the tresses of man's mind'.167 Meaning that God, as a spark of divinity or as a reflection of his unity as a potential wholeness, is contained within the consciousness of man. Hence, whatever has to be mended in, or of, divinity may be effected in the intropsychic dialectics of the individual human being. Indeed, the phrase 'and thou shalt know your God' said when tying the phylacteries in the morning prayer is taken by the Bratzlav Hasidim to mean an agapic copulation, because yada means both knowledge and sexual intercourse in Hebrew. Hence, intentional</page><page sequence="87">Epilogue and Overture 1 97 concentrated prayer is meant to effect a dialogue between man and God through the barrier of transcendence. The meditative prayer which links the soul of man and God effects also an éxtasis of the psyche of a man at worship, although momentary from diachronic time to the synchronicity of timelessness. The goal of prayer is to pass over the threshold of temporality and reach God in timeless eternity. However, the ultimate union with God is effected through sanctification of the name of the Lord, by sacrificing oneself for one's faith in Him. Then the martyred soul ascends, according to Lurianic Kabbala, directly to heaven and unites with God.168 The Indirect Passage We have seen that ontological, existential, and social barriers are necessary; otherwise man would no longer be able to develop his proficiency as mediator between his subject and the material world. He would not be prodded to strive towards temporal and metaphysical goals, since a free passage to the unknown would make it graspable, familiar, and easy, like the tip of a mountain that has been climbed and explored. This might be another layer of the proscription of knowledge in the myth of original sin. The direct assault on metaphysical barriers is proscribed by most religions. The Jewish God cannot and should not be seen and no man can know his place.169 Likewise, Greek mortals should not avail themselves of the rights and privileges of the gods lest they be smitten for their hübris. Hence, the crossing of barriers must be roundabout, indirect, and clandestine. One may pass over the threshold of a partition only in a maieutic manner; meaning that the sender of intentions and desire to communicate such generates a symbolon structure which may transmit energies, words, and mythogenes which may not even pierce the relevant ontological, epistemic, and social barriers, but which may engender in the other partner of the dyad, on the other side of the barrier, a feeling, a message, or a belief that he himself created the idea, the design for an artifact or tenet. Such roundabout communication is intended to franchise the barrier between history and transcendence through interpersonal dialogue and between consciousness and quantum processes. Let us return to the maieutic relationship between history and transcendence. We may envisage the call of man: 'Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord; Lord hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications'.170 This is the call of prayer to be reciprocated by a maieutic response from transcendence. If revelation comes following authentic directional prayer, this is indeed a dialogue between man and God, since all mediation between subject and object, consciousness and</page><page sequence="88">1 98 God as the Shadow of Man energy-matter, history and transcendence, must take place within the cognitive processes of man, the meta-connecting agent. This is all that can be postulated, and, in all probability, this is all there is. In the Gnostic text, describing the revelation experienced by Zostrianos, through his rapport with Ephesek, we read thus: ...these same powers exist in the world. Within the Hidden Ones corresponding to each of the aeons stand glories, in order that he who is in [the world] might be safe beside them. The glories are perfect thoughts living with the powers; they do not perish because they are models of salvation by which each one is saved when he receives them. He receives a model and strength through the same (power), and with the glory as a helper he can, thus, pass out from the world.171 Indeed, there is an extatic revelatory link with hidden powers through the receiving of a cognitive model of salvation. This is, in our conceptualization, a maieutic enthousiasmos in the Greek sense, which is an experience of the divine through a cognitive trigger of a connecting symbolon structure believed to have been expedited by transcendental powers. Whether this is so is irrelevant since the experience of revelation in itself is sufficient to effect a religious belief in a link with God. This is even more apparent with Marcionite Gnostics who believed that 'the adopted souls that listen to, and accept, the message of the stranger of God are saved by their own experience of faith, not because they receive some sort of Gnosis'.172 Gnostic salvation is triggered by an inner process of maieutic revelation, irrespective of whether a message has or has not been sent by the 'stranger alien God', as reffered to by the Gnostics, who might have been even perennially silent, as postulated by Camus in his exposition of the metaphysical predicament of man.173 The effective teacher is like a midwife; he helps his pupils give birth to ideas which they cherish as their own much more than if they had been coerced by authoritarian teachers, who force their ideas on their charges ex cathedra. Aside from Socrates, the archetypal maieutic teacher, Mahavira, the founder of Jainism and Gautama the Buddha, who were almost contemporaries of Socrates, also preached their doctrine by personal example and roundabout metaphors. In all probability, Christ was also a maieutic teacher who had the charismatic quality of sparking in his disciples a revelation which they felt to have been generated within their inner-selves. Such maieutic transmission is the essence of Buberian dialogue. Buber regarded the I-thou dialogue as the prime ontological existence. The hyphenated I-thou dialogos , entering through the word in the Greek sense, creates maieutically an essence of being with which the</page><page sequence="89">Epilogue and Overture 1 99 'I' or the thou by themselves cannot effect. Such miraculous passing through the barrier of the subject-other is a moment of grace since the natural inter-personal relationship is an alienated I-it.174 Moreover, the flow of grace in an I-thou relationship creates God, who is the universal thou. Hence, in the Buberian context, an authentic I-thou dialogue also pierces the barrier between temporality and transcendence, since I-it is an historical relationship fettered in the prison of time, whereas an I-thou relationship is metaphysical. Buber distills some basic notions of Lurianic Kabbala and Hasidism into his dialogic philosophy. Thus, the creation of the universal thou through an authentic I-thou dialogue may be linked to the kabbalist premise that Akatriel, one of God's countenances, asked Ishmael, the high priest, to bless him175 and to the Ba'al Shem Tov's statement that God is the shadow of man. Dialogue is also the great equalizer, since an I-thou relationship can happen only between free equals. Subjugation invariably leads to an I-it petrifaction. Can love, both erotic and spiritual, cross the interpersonal barrier? We have dealt elsewhere with love as a variation on the theme of dialogue.176 The conception of the dyad of love as an unattainable dialogue has been expressed thus by Georg Simmel: The fact that male and female strive after their mutual union is the foremost example or primordial image of a dualism which stamps our life-contents generally. It always presses toward reconciliation, and both success and failure of the reconciliation reveal this basic dualism only the more clearly. The union of man and woman is possible, precisely because they are opposites. As something essentially unattainable, it stands in the way of the most passionate craving for convergence and fusion. The fact that, in any real and absolute sense, the 'I' can not [sic] seize mutual supplementation and fusion seem to be the very reason for the opposites to exist at all. Passion seeks to tear down the borders of the ego and to absorb T and thou in one another. But it is not they which become a unit: rather a new unit emerges, the child.177 Simmel' s ingenious observation, which is not very far removed from our own conception of the unachievable aims of the core-vectors, is that the impossibility of union between man and woman leads to the dialectical synthesis of the child. This seems to us as too mechanistic a concretization of dialectics. We envisage that man and woman are induced by a mirage of participation that emanate from sex and love to mate analogously to the way racing dogs are lured to win by an ever-receding plastic rabbit running in front of their noses. Male and female do not directly intend to perpetuate the species by their sex and love. They are tricked into it by their programming. They are driven to</page><page sequence="90">200 God as the Shadow of Man mate by the quest of orgasm, which is meant to be a quick glimpse of participation, and by the Tantalic visions of eternal love, which is a surrogate image of the unattainable aims of our participant core-vectors. The agonies of love described by the myriads of lovers, from pulp magazines to the Song of Songs , stem from Ego's feeling that 'he opened up' towards his beloved Alter and that he/she did not respond to him as expected. This is the inevitable gap between Ego's amorous expectations and Alter' s response. Ego many times experiences the chagrin of the disenchanted lover for having invested so much emotion in such an unworthy person. Ego would rarely have the inclination, or the ability, to realize that he projected on Alter his inner craving for participation and expected him to fulfill this core longing by their love. As intersubjective communication is an ontological impossibility. Alter cannot perceive Ego's expectations and is even less able to fulfill them. 'That love is suffering', says Capellanus, 'is easy to see, for before love becomes equally balanced on both sides there is no torment greater, since the lover is always in fear that his love may not gain its desire and that he is wasting his efforts'.178 Love, however, cannot be equally balanced on both sides because Ego's amorous expectations from Alter, and vice- versa, are determined by their differences in gender, in neuro-endocrinology, in personality core-vectors, and in cultural imprints. Furthermore, Ego's expectations are bound to change with time and place so that Alter' s ability to meet these expectations are diminished further. What characterizes love at its peak is that the lover, spurred by an intense longing for participation, claims the exclusive attention and time of his beloved. Ego desires (sometimes accompanied by overt demands) to share all the thoughts and all experiences of Alter. At that very place and time, Alter may not be able or be willing to totally attune to Ego and match his staccato display of emotions. Alter may have reached his own emotional crescendo at another time or place, and he cannot or will not match his emotional crescendo at another time or place, and he cannot or will not match his emotional peaks with those of Ego. The pangs of love and the romantic agonies stem from the disparity of expectations between lover and beloved. Love is either Sisyphean or Tantalic because we tend to project on our beloved expectations of which we ourselves are not aware, so that the beloved cannot be expected to be aware of them. If we aspire for our love to be what it cannot be, we make it impossible. Consequently, the impossibility of love is related to Ego's projection of his personality core longing for participation. As Alter cannot fulfill this longing in the form, content, and duration expected by Ego, love is bound to be a temporary and often lonely trip of Ego brushing occasionally and tangentially with the emotional orbits of Alter.</page><page sequence="91">Epilogue and Overture 20 1 We shall deal extensively with the continuum ranging from the Sisyphean séparant lover who aims to include, subjugate, and swallow his beloved to the participant Tantalic who longs to be immersed, excluded, and, so to speak, consumed by his love. The latter has been depicted in literature and art as l'amour sacré, the spiritual and sacred love for a person who stands for and symbolizes an archetype such as the Great Mother, the Virgin Mary, an absolute value, the divine presence or God himself. This love of an ethereal purity is tailor-made as a surrogate participation dynamic: by immersing oneself in the spiritual love of an unattainable woman one enacts the longing of the core participant vector to partake in the absolute. The Tantalic nature of these sacred loves calls for their partial, at least, impossibility. The less attainable they are, the more pure, spiritual, and sacred they become. Temporary blindness and selective perception is of great help in such cases. Without them a Don Quixote can hardly be expected to sing odes of love and worship to a Dulcinea the way she really is. The main function of the beloved in a Tantalic participant dyad is to trigger and reflect the lovers' own longing to partake in an omnipresent absolute and melt into an all-engulfing wholeness. Both the form and contents of the participant expectation of the lover are determined by his biological parameters including gender, his participant or séparant personality structure, and his socialization in a Sisyphean or Tantalic culture.179 For Ego's amorous expectations as determined by his bio-psycho-cultural configuration to be met by Alter, the latter' s expectations, as determined by his configuration must be exactly complementary, which is a statistical improbability. Second, as we have stated in the Violence of Silence , meaningful communication is more feasible on shallow and routine levels of encounter, whereas on deeper levels of encounter communication is hardly possible.180 The expectations of love are for the deepest level of encounter and for the most complete fusion of bodies and souls, yet communication between the lovers as to the intricate nuances of their mutual expectations is almost impossible. Consequently, the more a couple are in love, the less able the partners are to convey to each other the depths, range, and intensity of their emotions and mutual expectations of each other. Third, we know that an extreme need dulls all the other functions of the body and personality. It generates biased perceptions, even hallucinations. For example, hungry subjects perceive food-related stimuli, ignoring a wide range of others.181 Likewise, a sex-hungry subject or one who is emotionally infatuated by love cannot evaluate the stimuli and expectations of his beloved except in the context of his turbulent</page><page sequence="92">202 God as the Shadow of Man emotions. Ego, the lover, is bound, therefore, to twist his perception and expectations of his beloved Alter according to his emotionally biased perceptions, which are twisted in turn by his own intense motivated expectations. The more intense the love is, the more the impossibility of a meaningful communication between the lovers to enable them to realize their participant aim. Love seems to be dominated by a self-defeating negative feedback cycle. Finally, the investigators of the least interest principle have shown that when Ego is very high in his emotional involvement, Alter seems to cool off, and vice-versa.182 Although this phenomenon is well documented, as far as we know no one has yet offered an etiological explanation it. We, however, are able to do so: a séparant Ego who aims to conquer Alter will losé interest once he achieves his aim. This is especially so when Ego's desire to overpower Alter is dominated by his séparant core personality vector, which is not satisfied by an intermediate conquest, but which is ever craving to subjugate and swallow more bodies. A participant Ego, with his ever-ready submission, will be taken and had by the séparant Alter only to be rejected immediately afterwards, as just another item in the conqueror's log book. If both Ego and Alter are séparants (or participants), an amorous encounter between them would be quite unlikely from the outset. As their expectations are diametrically opposed, they are more likely to be repelled by each other than attracted to each other. If sex is bait, and the exclusive communion through love cannot be attained, what reinforces the torrents of emotion invested by couples throughout the world trembling with desire for each other? What sustains the furtive longing glances of girls and boys in societies which forbid public manifestations of love? What makes a Tristan and Isolde so turbulently immortal, or the death for love of a Romeo and Juliet so intensely and continuously relevant? What makes Solomon's love song ever fresh and the clichés of Segal's Love Story sell millions of copies? The answer is that the longing in itself for the communion of love, and not its attainment, is the necessary and sufficient reinforcer. Moreover, in many cases, some amorous longings should not be quenched, so as to ensure their viability. Solomon of the Song of Songs, after trying to fulfill his amorous longing with a thousand spouses, reached the abysmal despair of Ecclesiastes. Ephraim Kishon, the Israeli satirist, had the ingenuity of continuing the story of Romeo and Juliet who have been saved, been married, and have sunk into the nagging life of a bourgeois boredom. Kierkegaard, on the other hand, renounced the realization of his love, thereby freeing it from the bonds of its fulfilment. By making his love independent of its fulfilment, Kierkegaard assured its continuity.</page><page sequence="93">Epilogue and Overture 203 Participant union by sex and the grace of communion by love, as spurred by our core- vectors, are unattainable. Yet the common longing for them by people in love creates a bond and a frame into which their different participant cravings might be expressed. Love encloses the lovers within a common boundary in which their separate and disparate visions of union seem to each one of them as if flowing in unison. We have stated earlier that without the pleasure of orgasm species would probably not engage in sex. Yet the need for reproduction and for the ever-evolving more effective links between spirit and matter produces in the orgasm, if mutual, the most intensive sense of union between human beings in the here-and-now. It seems as if our programming has a desperate need to bring about reproduction for reasons known only to itself, with the process of reproduction being the aim of the exercise, while the reproducing life forms seem to be tools or secondary instruments to the process of reproduction itself. Moreover, we have seen that sex is a very consuming activity, both physical and mentally. It involves some violent conflicts with other males and some cramped, painful, and sometimes dangerous positions during mating itself. No life form is likely to engage in reproduction, which seems to be the target of our programming, unless we have been baited, as indeed we are, by short-lived experiences of participant bliss in orgasm and non-realizable visions of the communion of love. Our programming seems to be indifferent to the fact that the Tantalic fata morgana of love cannot be fulfilled as long as it helps to blunt the violence and stress incidental to courting and mating and brings the life forms to reproduce successfully. We are anaesthetized by sex and love to carry on reproducing in circumstances which are at best repetitive and at worst violent and painful. The name of the game is reproduction. Yet our programmer did not divulge why it is all so important to him or to us. Moreover, it seems to offend our sense of fair play that the baits of sex and love, although effective, have not been construed with more sophistication, so that they would seem, at least, more credible and viable. Reproduction seems to be the raison d'être of life. Animals stop their fighting and courting after mating, flowers wane after fertilization, and pregnant women lose their eagerness to flirt. In most cultures, especially séparant ones, youth is worshipped as a corollary to fertility, whereas sterile old age is dreaded and considered non-aesthetic. Only in some of the more participant cultures in the Far and Middle East, which anchor on transcendence and other worldliness, is old age revered. In a similar vein, the infatuation of love seems to wane with marriage and childbirth, as if the bait of love takes one up to reproduction and becomes superfluous after it. Also, with sexual arousal, and during intercourse, the body of the</page><page sequence="94">204 God as the Shadow of Man mate and its odors feel and smell attractive, but right after orgasm, some parts of the mate's body might seem repulsive and disgusting. After reproduction, the bait of sex and love has fulfilled its purpose. The rose petals fall off the swelling of the fertilized hips; pregnant women lose their expectant freshness, and the queen ants, after their mating flight, are shorn of their wings and the drones chased away. Life has fulfilled its purpose. The time for play is over, and the nest should be prepared for the young. The centrality of reproduction to life may be apparent in the frantic efforts of injured or sick plants to muster their last vestiges of energy to flower prematurely and produce seed. Lastly, the worst blow to a human being is the death of his offspring because it deprives him of his programmed raison d'être of reproduction. Yet the ecstasy of orgasm is short. It is, however, adequate for the function of reproduction, and it conditions us to seek more and more orgasm in order to experience again the fleeting sense of union. 'After intercourse all animals are sad', says the Latin proverb. Is it because the pitifully short bait of ecstatic orgasm has vanished and the participants are re-confronted with their séparant state of existential drudgery and misery? With the human male there is an abrupt post-orgasmic loss of sexual tension and a momentary loss of erotic interest in his partner. Although women are slower in their post-orgasmic loss of stimulation susceptibility and many are capable of multiple orgasms, Masters and Johnson have established that there is a marked similarity between man's and woman's post-orgasmic resolution phases.183 As for lower animals, males do experience varying kinds of orgasmic ecstasies during ejaculation, but it is an open question as to what extent female fauna experience orgasm.184 Nevertheless, most female fauna do disregard sexual approaches after a copulation by which they have presumably been fertilized, while most female insects even stop the secretion of sexually attractive pheromones after mating.185 Following are some observations by Briffault, which although outdated, have been supported by subsequent research: With a large proportion of mammalian species, the association between the male and the female does not extend beyond the primary purpose for which the sexes come together - the fecundation of the female. After that function is fulfilled there appears to be, as a general rule, an actual repulsion between the sexes. 'As soon as pairing is over,' says Brehm, speaking of mammals generally, 'great indifference is shown towards one another by the sexes.' Among most carnivora, cohabitation of the male with the female takes place for a short time only during the rutting season, and in many species there is no cohabitation at all. Weasels continue together during the mating season for a</page><page sequence="95">Epilogue and Overture 205 week or more, then separate completely. Bears do not cohabit after sexual congress; 'no one yet has found two adult black bears in one den; mother and half-grown cubs have been taken together in the same winter quarters, but never two old ones.' 4 1 have never seen the two (male and female) together at any time of the year,' says an experienced observer of the species; 'they meet by chance and again separate.' The same is reported of the Indian, and of the polar bear. The jaguar cohabits with the female during one month of the year only; and the cougar during a few weeks. The leopard male and female live entirely separate. 1 86 The conclusion is that after copulation and mating, the abating of orgasm and its instantaneous glimmering of participant bliss have fulfilled their purpose and are, henceforth, unnecessary. The males have impregnated the females, and the species is hooked on its task of reproduction. From this point on our programmer seems to lose interest in the moods, ecstasies, and sexual attraction of the parents. Its interest is already fully concentrated on the fetus. Orgasm is a short-lived exposure to a subjective peak experience of participant bliss cleverly manipulated to serve the purposes of our programming, which are unknown and unknowable by the sexual partners. The Spanish call orgasm la poca muerta , hinting at its participant and annihilating nature of longing to fuse with the sexual partner. Karen Horney realized the greater participatory significance of the nature of orgasm for the male than for the female. Man, she says, secretly longs for extinction through sex as a surrogate wish for reunion with woman-mother, whereas for a woman, sex is only the initiation of a new cycle of procreation.187 The more séparant role of woman in sex has thus been recognized by one of the pioneers of psychoanalysis. The participant component of orgasm is apparent in its temporary blunting of separate awareness and in the feeling of union with one's environment, bringing about a transitory sense of non-being. The Tantalic nature of the participant longing for orgasm is apparent in the physical and emotional build-up towards it. When the climax has been reached and a flicker of a sensation of union has been experienced, the orgasm is terminated, and the ecstatic participant revelation ends almost before it has begun. The longing for participation is the prime mover of orgasm because actual union with the object is, of course, not achieved. There is a marked similarity between the rhythmic movements of the devout in a participant mood of prayer and the pelvic thrusts striving towards orgasm. This might lend a serious hue to the 'wise guys about Jerusalem' who observe that the Wailing Wall is a very sexy place because men move to and fro in front of it, and the women behind their partition groan in ecstasy.</page><page sequence="96">206 God as the Shadow of Man Ferenczi envisaged the participant craving of man in orgasm as brought about by his identification with his penis, which itself identifies with the sexual partner in penetration; in ejaculation that identification is transferred to the semen.188 Individuals with a weak ego boundary may experience in orgasm a participant loss of body contour, a crumbling and melting down of the partition between themselves and their surroundings, including their sexual partners. This may account for the reluctance of individuals who have anxieties about their ego boundaries and body image to reach orgasm. For them to experience a participant melting down of their ego boundaries is tantamount to madness, for in their daily existence they relate a dissolution of their shaky ego boundary to just this. The enormity of orgasm and its overpowering effects on the senses have made people impute divinity to it. Indeed, the Greeks denoted genitalia as aidoion (inspirers of holy awe).189 Many religions frown on the pleasures of sex, and most condemn sexual activity which is geared only towards pleasure. Such condemnation seems to stem from the religious sanctioning of our programming to reproduce. Our programmer and his religious guardians feel cheated if we enjoy our sexual experiences without reproducing. The séparant component of sex is the epitome of Sisypheanism. Ego's craving to overpower and swallow Alter through intercourse may be phantasized during the short span of orgasm, only to be confronted immediately with the post-orgasmic reality. Yet the séparant ego is sure to resume his pursuit of more sex and more orgasms, culminating in identical Sisyphean failure, followed by the inevitable renewed effort to overpower the sexual partner through the peak imagery of orgasm. We should remind ourselves at this point that the séparant-participant components of orgasm constitute a continuum, with women biologically predisposed to be nearer its séparant pole and men to its participant pole. These biological predispositions are the results of many factors and may be shifted to smaller or greater extents by oral fixations and later cultural imprints. The séparant nature of the human female orgasm is not so much related to the vaginal or clitoral excitation as to the orgasmic platform which develops at the outer third of the vagina, contracting rhythmically at the onset of orgasm, embracing and containing the penis, and absorbing its flow of semen.190 The more participant nature of the human male's orgasm is inherent in the penetration and ejaculation of the penis spurting out spermatozoa to be absorbed by the ova (although some male orgasm may occur without ejaculation). Subjective phantasies in orgasm involving both body image and object perception are initiated by a participant blurring of the contours of both</page><page sequence="97">Epilogue and Overture 207 the self and partner by both men and women. The voluntary control of body movements is felt to be impaired, along with a feeling of emptiness, an internal void,191 as well as a diffuse floating and flying sensation.192 Both Kinsey et al and Masters and Johnson have reported a temporary lapse of contact with reality during orgasm. Kinsey and his associates have stated: All of our evidence indicates that there is a considerable and developing loss of sensory capacity which begins immediately upon the onset of sexual stimulation and which becomes more or less complete, sometimes with complete unconsciousness, during the maximum of sexual arousal and orgasm. At orgasm, some individuals may remain unconscious for a matter of seconds or even for some minutes. There are French terms, 'la petite mort' (the little death) and 4 la mort douce' (the sweet death), which indicate that some persons do understand that unconsciousness may enter at this point.193 The above is precisely our conception of a temporary participant diffusion of the ego boundary and body image. After such initial participant baiting inherent in the orgasm of both males and females, we may note the following marked differences: women see in intercourse and orgasm just the first phase of reproduction. Consequently, even their phantasies at sexual arousal, intercourse, and orgasm are related to the link between sex and reproduction, whereas men focus more during intercourse on their immediate sexual gratification.194 This indicates that even in the throws of orgasm the woman does not lose awareness of her séparant programming to reproduce. Kinsey et al have reported that women find more satisfaction during intercourse in their séparant sensation of receiving, whereas men find their psychological rewards and satisfaction mostly in their participant feeling of penetrating.195 Of special importance is Kinsey' s report that: The slower responses of the female in coitus appear to depend in part upon the fact that she frequently does not begin to respond as promptly as the male, because psychologic stimuli usually play a more important role in the arousal of the average male and a less important role in the sexual arousal of the average female. The average male is aroused in anticipation of a sexual relationship, and he usually comes to erection and is ready to proceed directly to orgasm as soon as or even before he makes any actual contact. The average female, on the contrary, is less often aroused by such anticipation, and sometimes she does not begin to respond until there has been a considerable amount of physical stimulation.196</page><page sequence="98">208 God as the Shadow of Man The more object-oriented woman needs substantive tactile stimulation to be sexually aroused, whereas the more participant abstract male may be easily aroused sexually by erotic phantasies and imagery. The more down-to-earth functions of woman seem to permeate right through her need to be more directly and physically manipulated in order to be sexually aroused and satisfied. As a woman is more firmly aware of her bodily contours and boundaries, she is also bound to have more anxieties of being, that is of losing her body image, during orgasm.197 The more séparant woman needs a firm anchor on her objective surroundings, and if these fade in orgasm she is liable to be frightened. Masters and Johnson report that their female subjects had a feeling of receptive opening during orgasm, whereas the male feels at the onset of orgasm the inevitability of his penetrating ejaculatory thrust.198 This again vindicates our portrayal of the more séparant Sisyphean role of woman and the more participant Tantalic role of man in sex and orgasm. Man and woman are predisposed to seek different aims. These aims can never be achieved, and even their baited imagery are diametrically opposed. Sometimes the latter are complementary, but mostly they are not. The fruits of orgasm are, indeed, a successful union between those involved in the act of sex and in love. The child synthesizes within himself the genes of his parents, their personalities, as transmitted to it during early socialization and the socio-normative imprints, as ingrained in it both by the parents and other socialization agencies. The child is the convergence of the desires, hopes, and longings of his parents. No wonder that it was projected mytho-empirically as the archetypal mediator: the Son of God. Indeed, the Trinity of Christian dogma, as well as the trinity of the Demetrian Tesmophoria, is the mytho-empirical incarnation of the synchronicity of the parents and offspring in the biological personal and cultural senses. This is also the resolution of the paradox of a plurality within unity as stated in the New Testament: For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.199 The Kabbala postulates a complimentarity between the erotic and agapic love as follows:</page><page sequence="99">Epilogue and Overture 209 Arikh anpin ^TnTa^ ^ ^ ^A b Keter Bina Hochma D in h essed ^ 0 ^ Tife'ret Netzah Y e s s o d A ^Ze'er I anpin ▼ N u k b a h M alchut ^ Figure 3.15 The ten rungs are divided into five countenances. The upper countenance is the arikh anpin , the long suffering imperfect God whose imperfections induces him to create and long for a mending tikkun with the demiurgical history. Abba and Ima the supernal father and mother, have to mate continuously in an agapic constant mating otherwise the work of divinity will perish. The lower two countenances of ze'er anpin , the male and nukbah, the female, mate for the purpose of reproduction and the complementarity between the supernal and lower countenance. Thus, they link transcendence and history. In Christianity, we also have the agapic mating which gave birth to Jesus through an immaculate conception and, likewise, the agapic spiritual love between Saint John of the Cross and Saint Theresa d'Avilla. We may ask, therefore, if love is agonizing, painful, frustrating, unattainable, illusory, subjugating, petrifying, and well nigh impossible, what then kindles its fires? What induces us to indulge, da capo, in the amorous cycles of involvement, infatuation, and disenchantment? We claim that our yearning for love, be it the Sisyphean covetousness of possessing our beloved or the Tantalic longing to fuse with him or her, is the essence of love. The process of involvement kindles our amorous fires and not the attainment of our love goals, which are as unachievable as the aims of our participant and séparant core vectors. Nietzsche laments not so much his lost love for Frau Lou Andreas Salomé as the destruction of his illusions of love, indeed, of his ability to long for it.200 Plato describes such yearning for union in love as follows: For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover's intercourse, but of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a</page><page sequence="100">2 1 0 God as the Shadow of Man dark and doubtful presentiment. Suppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, comes to the pair who are lying side by side and says to them, 'What do you people want of one another?' They would be unable to explain. And suppose, further, that when he saw their perplexity he said: 'Do you desire to be wholly one; always day and night to be in one another's company? for if this is what you desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live share a common life as if you were a single man, and after your death in the world below still be one departed soul instead of two - I ask whether this is what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attain this?' There is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need. And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love.201 The essence of love is, not the attainment of unity but, the longing for it. Which of us did not experience the thrill, the elation, the quickening of the pulse when revisiting the place of our first kiss and embrace. The yearning for an amorous encounter is enough to fill our hearts, even though its realization is remote or even impossible. The craving for love takes us out of our daily routines and drudgeries and lends a dimension of elation to our Sisyphean quests and infuses revelation into our Tantalic longing. Such independent potency of the yearning for love, which has an essence and a dynamic of its own irrespective of the object of love, might well be the reason for our being baited by it to mate and reproduce. Love songs, tales, myths, and drama are anchored on the yearning for amorous union and not on the processes of mating, reproduction, and growth. Camus succeeded in capturing the essence of this yearning by describing 'the Adulterous Woman', who exudes a free-floating longing for love towards no specific object, but radiates this longing in all directions to the earth, sky, sea, and stars to be borne along by the evening breeze.202 Man is in love with love. The objects of our amorous involvement, however, are transitory. What is permanent throughout our life is our yearning for love and to be loved. The Tantalic longing for love has been projected onto religion as the pure Mother of God, the graceful Sophia, and Shekhina. The timelessness of love is a function of the longing for it. A sacred love is a love for an inaccessible object. The rebellion of the participant lover is to immerse himself into his longing for his beloved, however unattainable he or she may be and however impossible the love might be. The rebellious lovers' motto is to love at all costs and to hell with the consequences. Adele H., of the movie portraying some of the</page><page sequence="101">Epilogue and Overture 2 1 1 actual trials of Victor Hugo's daughter, carries on her Tantalic love irrespective of the indifference of her beloved, oblivious to his rejection of her. The professor in The Blue Angel carries on his debasing love affair with the cabaret dancer even though he is fully aware that he is being destroyed by it. In a similar ideational context, but a different setting, Beatrix in Claude Grote' s film The Lace Embroidery can only achieve a pure and perfect love in the total isolation of an insane asylum. Kierkegaard performed his metaphysical rebellion concurrently with his renunciation of the consummation of his love for Regina Olsen. By so doing, he elevated his love to a stature of permanence. He extruded it from the precariousness of spatio-temporality and made it timeless. He also prevented it from souring through the leveling down and petrifying routines of matrimony. He renounced a love object and gained a permanent love-longing. To yearn for a love irrespective of the possibilities of its realization, and even being certain that it is unattainable, is to render it absolute. By the same logic, but for diametrically opposite ends, Sade aimed to destroy the longing for love and, thereby, annihilate love itself. He realized that the prime mover of love is the yearning for it. Hence, the destruction of such longing will bring with it as a necessary corollary the extinction of love. This fits Sade's radical nihilistic design of killing sex through boredom by repetitive perversion. He wished to be society's ultimate executioner, because, without a yearning for an amorous encounter and a longing for an emotional dialogue, man enters a state of indifference and loneliness and, hence, a lack of empathy and desire for involvement with his human surroundings. Without the longing fpr union, the act of sex becomes a mere banality which eventually destroys the erotic passions. Without the Tantalic longing for grace and the Sisyphean dreams anchored on sex, the contours of flesh, the texture of skin, and the glow of eyes lose their bait value, and love peters out. By killing erotic desire and the yearning for love, which sustain the human core-vectors, Sade meant to halt reproduction, dissolve the human family, and disrupt the normative system which he hated. He knew that by depriving man of the longing for love, human life, which he despised and aimed to annihilate, would become not only unbearable, but totally meaningless, and, hence, not worth living. Sade's negation highlights the basic assertion of life inherent in the longing for love. The mutual longing of lovers for an emotional dialogue provides a framework, a context, a scaffolding for their love. Two lovers holding hands on a moonlit shore might have different expectations and be on the opposite poles of the participant-separant continuum. Yet, their mutual longing for love provides them with a channel through which their</page><page sequence="102">2 1 2 God as the Shadow of Man divergent Tantalio revelations and Sisyphean aspirations may flow out and provide them and their offspring with some sort of a viable future. Only the longing for love can provide the human being's thrownness unto death with a silver lining of grace. To Storm the Wall Between One and the Many The barriers between the individual and society are both structural and normative. Since this is not a social or anthropological tract, we shall not engage in the present context in the interrelationship, either conformative or deviant, between the individual and society. We have elaborated extensively on these vast focal concerns elsewhere. Here we may deal with the various methods by which an individual may cross the structural and normative barriers of society. We should distinguish here between two barrier dichotomies: authentic versus inauthentic revelation and authentic versus inauthentic creativity. The crossing of these continua forms the model seen in figure 3.16: A u th e n tic Rebellious Prophet Innovator Martyr Creativity R evelation Administrator Priest Organized Appartchik cliques Inauthentic Figure 3.16 The prophet is the man who reveals ultimate meanings to his community of believers because he had a divine revelation concerning truth or the proper behavior. He either has the tablets of the Law like Moses or the Logos, the word of God, like later prophets. These ultimate meanings, when communicated to members of the community, irrespective of his social position, becomes, as Rabbi Joseph Sloveitchik has stated a community of the Covenant.203 This is based on the summing up of Moses in Deuteronomy: 'Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God: your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of Israel; your little ones, your wives and the stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water. That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; but with</page><page sequence="103">Epilogue and Overture 2 1 3 him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day.'204 This community of the Covenant enables each individual to cross the veil between himself and the group and feel at one with it. The same holds for ideologies. The charismatic leader-prophet reveals the social and political truths to be followed by each individual comprising the group, which may then serve as the economic glue which ties the group together and serves as the basis for every individual to identify with it. However, to make such solidarity possible, group martyrs are necessary. These martyrs, in the Greek sense, are witnesses - in Arabic even today every person who dies for a cause is a shaheed, a witness. The martyrdom effects the belief or ideology to emerge extatically in the Greek sense of éxtasis from the sequences of time and exist in an eternal present like the Christian belief that the crucifixion of Christ takes place everyday. Also, martyrs as mythogenes charge the batteries of all those who would follow in their religious and ideological steps and pay the price. Jesus Christ, el-Hlage, and Rabbi Akiba fired the beliefs and readiness for self-victimization of would-be martyrs; Socrates, Galileo, and Giordano Bruno strengthened those who were ready to renounce their truths. Jan Patočka, who signed the charter 77 together with Havel and Hayek in Communist Czechoslovakia and paid with his life,205 is just an instance of the myriad of political martyrs who fuel the altruistic solidarity of millions of ideological rebels and would-be rebels and, thus, help them to cross the barrier between themselves and the group and feel solidarity with it and act accordingly. Per contra, the priests of institutionalized religions, as well as the political apparatchiks who succeed the martyrs and self-sacrificing revolutionaries, reap the temporal rewards and build ramparts of power, suppression, and oppression, which strengthen and thicken boundaries between the individual and his membership groups. The institutionalized power brokers of the church have no use for martyrs and prophets. Dostoevski's Grand Inquisitor tells Christ, who made good on his promise for a Second Coming, to go away. The power structure of the church has no use for troublemakers who rock the boat. Likewise, Koestler portrays masterfully in his Darkness at Noon the way the apparatchik Gletkin crushes the old Bolshevik Rubashov and convinces him that the last service he can offer the party is to confess that he was an imperialist spy who sabotaged the latest five year plan and, thus, serve as an expiating scapegoat for the failures of the Stalinist regime. The creative innovators fare no better. The process of branding the creative innovator deviant starts with the essence of innovation, which is the ability to see the commonplace and the familiar from new angles. This</page><page sequence="104">2 1 4 God as the Shadow of Man seeing things differently than most people makes the innovator point out different aspects and voice different opinions to the reasonable man about town. Hence, innovation is by definition non-normative, which raises the probability of non-conforming behavior. Indeed, many times genius is not more (yet not less) than the ability to perceive contrary to normative conditioning and socialization in a given family and culture. The ability to innovate is linked to one's aptitude to extricate oneself from the harness of stereotypes and clichés imposed by the reigning mandates of the generalized other and to project a novel and, therefore, rebellious vision onto one's creativity. Here again the revelatory component of creativity is a crucial ingredient of innovation. The innovator is also a perpetual child ever astounded by his curiosity, perceptions, and experiences and not stultified by drudgeries or normative routines. Creativity also necessitates a certain detachment. True, without objective involvement there can be no creativity, but the relationship is curvilinear. A too intense involvement may paralyze the creator. Hence, a measure of distance, apartness, and dissociation is necessary for the artist to gain the right perspective for creation. The artist could very easily be tagged by the normative branding agencies as alienated or deviant. This tag might be reinforced by the fact that the authentic creator is immersed in the process of creativity and is relatively oblivious to money and fame. This is apparent in extremo with a Kafka, who was not even willing to have his work published, or with an Erich Neumann, who was determined to go on writing even if no one read his work, or with a Van Gogh, who continued painting with a staccato urgency while knowing he had no chance of being recognized in his lifetime by the art establishment. There might be no better way of illustrating our premise than the advertisement of the Time/Life Library of Art of its Van Gogh volume which says: 'It took the eyes of a madman to see the world in a new light and to paint it that way'. Indeed, to see the world in a new light may predispose one to be stigmatized as a madman. We may, therefore, propose a hypothesis for empirical investigation that most great innovations and creations have been carried out by creators who have been considered as outsiders, outcasts, deviants, and madmen in their own lifetime. This is a variation on Kropotkin's hypothesis that all great discoveries and epoch-making researches were carried out outside academic institutions or, we may add, by deviants and outsiders within academia.206 The persecution of Galileo, the pestering of Bach, and the early loneliness of Einstein are just celebrated instances representing a host of others. The extreme forms of creator-audience relationships present Scylla and Charybdis choices. The extremely isolated and non-communicative artist is embedded in the solipsism of being both creator and audience.</page><page sequence="105">Epilogue and Overture 2 1 5 This might be illustrated by Dostoevski's Man in The Underground. On the other extreme, we have the poet laureate and the court jester who are not so far apart in their total dependence on some relevant others and in their need to cater to the tastes and whims of their audience. However, these are extreme poles of a continuum; most artists can be positioned between them. The more the artist anchors on his participant revelatory inner core, the less is his creation marketable, although its participant uniqueness enhances its durability or even timelessness. The participant creator tries to ensure the authentic sincerity of his art, but he cannot evaluate its reception by the consumers of his creation. He may also decide that the process of creativity is more important to him than the peddling of his art, so that he would be discovered after his death or even not at all. We can only guess how many Bachs are totally forgotten, because they did not have a Mendelshohn-Bertoldy to rediscover them; how many Van Goghs have been consigned to oblivion because they did not have a brother Theo to love, cherish, and preserve their work for posterity; even how many Johnsons are untraceable because they did not have a Boswell to pester them and record their utterances for generations to come. Often the participant revelatory artist immersed in visions of his inner-self is not willing to compromise with his audience and insist à la Artaud to be accepted on his own esoteric terms, not realizing that he is asking for the impossible. Mostly, however, the artist receives feedback of his worth from a specific audience or from people whose opinion he values most. This is even more apparent in the case of the performing artist, whose art is focused on his ability to pass over to his audience. A prominent Israeli actress once said that the stage for her is a sacrificial altar on which she prays to achieve revelatory elation; yet even for her, the audience was essential because the actor-audience relationship is the creative unit of the dramatic performance. Many times an actor sacrifices his personal well being, his health, and his livelihood for the actor-audience dialectical interstrains and interplay which are the essence of his art and its main reward. As we have tried to show earlier, creativity aims at communication with objects and people - this is its authentic raison d'être. However, when the end product is complete, its promotion and exposition may be pursued for recognition, fame, and money. These two processes have hardly anything in common. The quest for communication in creativity anchors on the process of creation and fuels the self-expression inherent in this process, whereas the sale of the end product depends solely on promotion, image-building and public relations not very different from the technique of selling detergents and cereals. Writing a book with a wish that someone pick it up today or a hundred years from now and feel</page><page sequence="106">2 1 6 God as the Shadow of Man an affinity with the author's ideas is a dynamic of communication inherent in the process of authentic creativity. Per contra, the part of one's motivation to write for pecuniary gain or recognition by the generalized other is extraneous to authentic creativity. The initial sale of creations and works of art is inversely related to their authenticity and revelatory depth, which stems from the uniqueness of the creator's inner-self. This is based on promotion techniques, which cater to the lowest common denominator of public tastes, in order to ensure a widest possible exposure and largest sale. When an author tries to communicate the intricate feelings, conflicts, thoughts, and interpersonal relationships as experienced by his unique psycho-cultural configuration, he is bound to experience difficulties in expressing himself with the rather inadequate means of language. Words at best are only approximate echoes of one's thoughts and feelings and at worst twist the level of the uniqueness of the author's experience. Also, an authentic creator anchored on the process and not on the end product of his art is not likely to make compromises with his audience to facilitate the easy understanding and absorption of his creation. Hence, his audience is bound to be rather limited. On the other hand, an author writing for the generalized other with a view to selling as many books as possible will utilize the shallow clichés and streamlined stereotypes which are palatable to the modal tastes of the masses. In extremo, this trend is manifest in the currently commercially very successful, no-frills books. The motto of the publishers of these books is 'avoid originality'. The Westerns in this genre of literature usually end with an immortal line like 'Joe (the cowboy hero) rides and fades into the sunset' and the romance novels with 'wordlessly, he swept her into his arms, and their spiral of ecstasy began'. The marketing of a creation, like the selling of any other product, is a function of power, money, and skill. Publishers, for instance, look for bestsellers, and if they have enough of them, allow themselves to publish occasional, quality, prestige pieces, which are good PR, even if they don't bring in enough money. Yet, one shouldn't exaggerate! When Herman Melville insisted on writing more of his think pieces, his publishers retorted that they had enough of these, and the public would prefer some racy adventure stories. Melville declared like Luther before the Inquisition that he could not do otherwise. He was then rejected into oblivion until he was rediscovered in the twenties after the centennial of his birth. Mostly, however, a certain creation will be recognized, accepted, and rewarded with money and fame because of vested economic and political interests, fads, or snob appeal. This is irrespective of the timeless value of a creation or its authenticity, which might be similar to other works of art which have not been discovered and publicly</page><page sequence="107">Epilogue and Overture 2 1 7 recognized. Some books, for instance, are carried onto the bestseller list by a new diet, a wave of feminism, or the marriage of the Prince of Wales. Others, like Arthur Koestler, Jacob Bronowsky, and Kenneth Clark are master popularizes for the masses of intricate scientific doctrines, philosophical theories, and art movements. Also, some great artists like Picasso, Dali, Graham Greene, and Ernest Hemmingway, who became financially successful in their lifetimes, were astute businessmen. Finally, chance, luck, and coincidence may play a major role in the rediscovery of creative giants like Bach and Melville. A great number of profound writings are probably still buried in oblivion because a convergence of factors did not generate a renaissance of interest in them, the likes of which happened to the works of Melville and Herman Hesse. Fame and money, however, have quite often asphyxiated creativity by a kiss of fat, inducing the artist to rest on his laurels. The greedy bourgeois so much despised by the authentic artist may, thus, have the last word. Especially painful is the case of Jacques Brel, whose last record, which he considered to be his rebellious testament, was callously commercialized by the carnivorous bourgeois peddlers who he so masterfully ridiculed in his songs. Creativity, being Sisyphean, is marked by fierce competitiveness, which tends to push it into an inauthentic quest of marketable products. The participant component of creativity makes for blunting this competitiveness and anchors the processes of creation. There is, however, enough venom and malice within ambition-crazed cliques to push many unheedful creators of the success pyramid into the abyss of oblivion. In the lore of the combative artistic cliques, this is expressed by the observation that the moment one starts climbing the ladder of public recognition and success there are those who already engineer his downfall. This, together with what is known in Hollywood as 'the curse of the Oscar' and in scientific circles as 'the noose of the Nobel Prize', constitutes the self-defeating component of public recognition. A best-selling author, an Oscar winner, or a Nobel laureate may be swept by success from his state of mind, which may be optimal for authentic creativity, and hurled into the momentarily loving but carnivorous bosom of the admiring public. Their roots may subsequently be severed from their sources, drained their juices of creativity, with a resultant blackout of production, which may last until a readjustment is effected. This temporary creative recession related, at least partly, to public recognition and glory was suffered by Rod Steiger and Albert Camus and is dreaded by John Le Carré with every new bestseller. This is the reason for his constant refusal to accept very lucrative invitations from Hollywood.</page><page sequence="108">2 1 8 God as the Shadow of Man We may denote mytho-empirically such fear, or flight from public acclaim, as the Jonah syndrome. Apart from the realization that material success is liable to deflate the dialectical energy underlying creation, the Jonah syndrome may also be motivated by the creator's agoraphobic dread of an excess of stimuli to which he may be exposed. It is quite understandable, according to our model, that a séparant carnivorous public, which cannot distinguish between the artist and his art, would devour both physically and mentally some muddle-headed performers like Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley. The institutionalized art establishment may also muffle the rebelliousness of creative artists by burying them in the coziness of its soft and overflowing contours. This happened to Jean Genet. After Sartre wrote a blockbuster of a book that turned Genet into the first existentialist saint, Genet, it is reported, could not write for five years. All he did was drive around in a Rolls Royce, changing his young male companions every few days. De Sade was completely institutionalized by the academic establishment which showered him with torrents of pompous verbosity - no doubt making the divine marquis turn in his grave. More disturbing, and yet proof of the universality of our model, is the fact that Camus himself, expounder of the myth of Sisyphus, succumbed to the vicissitudes of success. Public acclaim deprived him of the dialectical strain so vital for creativity. However, most creators search for recognition and the wealth that goes with it as a reinforcement of their sense of séparant worth. If public acceptance fails to materialize, they may be resentftil, basking in the halo of the genius unrecognized by the Philistines. This is sure to place our acclaim-thirsty artist under the dominion of the generalized other whose recognition he is trying to gain. This, in turn, further decreases the chances of authentic creation. The course which may finally prove to be both more authentic and more politic is to immerse oneself in the process of creativity and, thereby, gain one's sense of inner dialectical fulfillment. If public acclaim does come, one may accept it as a fringe benefit to authentic self-realization. Another fringe benefit might be, for those who are bent on it, vengeance against one's real or imaginary enemies. However, when one invests one's limited energies, in time and effort - consuming schemes to get even with one's opponents, one loses even if one gains, since the expended energies came to naught and the benefits are momentary, emotional satisfactions which are soon filed and forgotten. On the other hand, authentic creativity is rewarding to the creator as well as the best means of having one's enemies eat their hearts' out. Hence, even if the creator's motivation is strongly fueled by a desire</page><page sequence="109">Epilogue and Overture 2 1 9 to show them up (meaning his colleagues and competitors and the generalized other), his course of action should still be authentic creativity. Talent is not democratic. It has not been equally distributed among human beings. But nor does it favor the power elites of artistic cliques. The powerful and talentless within competitive groups, therefore, begrudge the talents of others in the group, especially if they are powerless and, hence, appropriate objects for stigmatization and scapegoating.207 The powerless talented are, therefore, predisposed to be tagged as deviants among the powerful pacesetters of professional, academic, and artistic groups. Moreover, in many forms of art and creativity, the cliques are also the arbiteri elegantiari. They use their power to brand as mediocre and worthless the work of the authentic creators who reject their authority or do not conform to the rules of the clique. The innovative outsider is usually ill-equipped to fight this judgment because he is mostly powerless, roaming somewhere on the fringes of institutionalized art or outside it. Therefore, the test of the artistic worth of an artist is outside time and place. Only in retrospect can we appreciate the excellence of a Mozart, a Van Gogh, or a Melville. The sad fact is that most innovative creators are recognized only after their death. During their lifetime, they are evaluated by cliquish interests and power structures averse to those who rock the boat. When the creator's critics and rivals are dead, as well as he, his creation can be given its rightful due in a disinterested context. Creators and their creations must effect an éxtasis in the ancient Greek sense in order to be evaluated in their proper perspective. Mere operators who enjoy wealth and acclaim because of their position of power will not even be remembered in footnotes, whereas the creative outsiders will be recognized for their contributions without the marring, blocking, and twisting effects of vested interests and power politics. The vested-interest and clique-based evaluation of the creator not only dates him, but also binds him in a derogatory manner to a given place. This could be denoted as the Muhammed syndrome, exemplified by the saying, 'there is no prophet in his own country'. The people of Mecca, Muhammad's hometown, did not accept him as their prophet, so he moved to Medina, where he was acclaimed as the emissary of God. Muhammad's trip from Mecca to Medina, the hej ira, was considered so crucial that it came to serve as the baseline for the Moslem calendar. Indeed, we could hear the gentry of Mecca muttering, 'This runny-nosed epileptic a prophet? Never!' The British say that 'familiarity breeds contempt', while Proust remarked that we cannot impute genius to the tablemate who picks his teeth after dinner. The deeper basis for the Muhammed syndrome is that the vested interests and power élite are wary</page><page sequence="110">220 God as the Shadow of Man of the creative innovator and try to suppress him. The authentic creator is more likely to fulfill himself creatively without the stifling normative prejudices of the indigenous others when he leaves, in a rebellious mood, for another place. Hence, authentic creativity is boundless. Artistic cliques are composed of a few artists, with many camp followers, lackeys, groupies, critics, managers, and spongers - all centered around a hard-core leadership that draws its power not from creative excellence but, from the control of budgets, journals, theaters, and radio and TV stations. They are separantly dependent on the clique for favors, employment, and for a sense of relative achievement which comes from stigmatizing their colleagues. The cliques, through their public-relations organs, create celebrities and destroy them. When some- one has been declared brilliant by the public communications channels, the declaration becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Even if everybody knows, including the artist who received the praise, that the critic responsible for the praise is a shallow mediocrity, the laudatory image receives the sanction of public opinion and vox populi, becomes vox Dei. This image of a given artist and his art created by the reigning pace setters and their PR organs, of course, have very little to do with authentic creativity, but are almost exclusively related to sales, power politics, and the egomania of some artists, reinforced by their camp followers and groupies. There are, however, many instances in which authentic creators need the good services of cliques, institutions, and establishments in order to expose their works to groups and individuals with whom they wish to communicate. These are, inter alia, professional organizations, congresses, publishing houses, theaters, and galleries. Camp followers, as well as sincere friends and constructive critics, give the artist the feedback he so ardently needs as a reinforcement of his sense of worth and an evaluation of the communicative worth of his creation. The creator may thereby become easy prey to flatterers who exploit him materially and emotionally. Because of his séparant need for reinforcement, he is in a poor position to distinguish between flatterer and sincere critic. The institutionalized outlets for his creations may shower him with prizes, honors, and positions that might stifle his creativity with a thick mesh of complacency and quench his authentic rebellion with pomposity and self-satisfaction. Creative people are usually too absorbed in their work to be willingly involved in administration and institutional power politics. Deans, directors of granting agencies, museum curators, and administrative directors of orchestras are usually people who have stopped being creative or have never been so. Yet they have power over creative people</page><page sequence="111">Epilogue and Overture 22 1 because they control the budgets and other essentials for the creator's work. Creative people soon find themselves at the mercy of such administrators, who are liable to abuse their power. The creator may rebel, but soon finds himself powerless. When he persists in standing on what he considers his legitimate rights, he is likely to be branded as a troublemaker or poor team member, be denied tenure, or even find himself without a job. His non-involvement in power politics - since his creative efforts absorb most of his time and energy - also predisposes him to loneliness, whereas the power-anchored controllers operate in cliques. Lilliputians always have to band together to fell a creative giant. The pseudo-bohemians, the synthetic bums and the salon rebels seek, and sometimes get, the best of two worlds: they are very good at adjusting to both fads and power shifts. They pose as artists and have the mannerisms, the expressions, and the bearing of poets, actors, and novelists. Apart from wearing the uniform, they also sit in the coffeehouses or bars which are reputed to be the watering holes of celebrities. What the pseudo-bohemians do not possess is the raison d'être of the artist - the process of authentic creativity itself which no material remuneration or social acclaim can rival in its sense of fulfillment. T.S. Eliot was usually clad in a conservative suit and tie. Modigliani frequented coffeehouses only to sell his paintings for a few francs to buy the cheap wine that eventually corroded his liver. Bach had the appearance and household of a harried shopkeeper. Yet all three felt what the synthetic bum could never feel - the majestic undulating of their inner eagles' wings lifting them from their places and times onto the boundless eternity of authentic creativity. As authentic creativity is a continuous process, one should continually seek new ways of expression and novel techniques of artistic communication. Any resting on laurels is tantamount to stagnation. However, in extremo, this constant pursuit of innovation may turn into a cult of newness which accepts anything, pseudo-art included, provided it is novel. 'We have learned so well how to absorb novelty', says Richard Hofstader, 'that receptivity itself has turned into a kind of tradition - the tradition of the new. Yesterday's avant garde experiment is today's chic and tomorrow's cliché.'208 Many phony artifacts or performances which intend to shock, overwhelm, or simply fool audiences may thus pose as art. However, most of the authentic innovators are stigmatized and ostracized by the processes we have described earlier in this section. This process may be described mytho-empirically as the transformation of the creative Sisyphus into the tortured Prometheus. Mythological transformations are very common, and we have elsewhere studied the transformation of Korē, Demeter's 'good' daughter, into 'horrible'</page><page sequence="112">222 God as the Shadow of Man Persephone.209 The process of transformation in the present context is the creative hiibris of the Sisyphus, which evokes the jealousy of the Olympian gods, who are the mythical projections of séparant men. The gods then punish Prometheus, just as the jealous and competitive power élite stigmatize and ostracize the unruly and rebellious creative innovators. The rock-burden of Sisyphus is, thus, symbolically transformed into the rock to which Prometheus is chained. It is also symbolic that the regeneration of Prometheus' liver and his subsequent torture by the vulture are cyclic, paralleling the cyclic trials of Sisyphus and his stone. (It is interesting in this context that the makers of Persian carpets deliberately introduce a flaw in it in order not to commit the hübris of perfection and thereby incur the wrath of the jealous gods.) The plight of the creative Prometheans may be pathetic when they do not understand the dynamics of relationships between innovators and the power structures of society. They may complain that their innovation benefited the group and humanity at large - so why have they been punished? Haven't the Promethean innovators brought light to humanity? Of course they have! But in the process they have rocked the boat. They have threatened the vested interests of, for instance, gas companies, which are bound to be threatened by Edison's electric light bulb. Above all, however, the creative innovators have raised the jealousy of the Olympians, the mythical séparant projections of the competitive power élite in society. They are much more concerned with maintaining their power than with artistic excellence, scientific progress, or the welfare of humanity. Creative, Promethean outsiders demand, with typical naiveté, that they be accepted by a public which is led and controlled by the power élite and vested interests against whom they have rebelled and whom they have injured. Their misfortune is, thus, exacerbated because they are ask- ing for the impossible. They do not realize that by being excellent they make the power élite appear even more mediocre and sterile than they are. Their difference and otherness fill the vulgur with apprehension and anxiety. Finally, their creativity makes them seem powerful, though socially and materially they are the opposite. Promethean outsiders are powerless power symbols and, as we have shown in The Mark of Cain , this combination makes them perfect scapegoats.210 On the macro level of metaphysical programming, the power élite, artistic cliques, and academia might offer an apology smacking of science fiction - that stigmatization of creative innovators serves as a guard against too much innovation, for which society is not prepared. The Inquisition, which in Galileo's time stood for stability, good order, propriety, and probity, and which, of course, was the staunch defender of the universal church, had to torture him to make him recant his atrocious</page><page sequence="113">Epilogue and Overture 223 contentions - which might have led to cosmic, social, and religious chaos. Yet Galileo could not help it. Being a rebellious creative innovator, he could not but declare against all convention 'and yet it (the earth) moves'. As we have shown throughout the present work, myths are projections onto mythology of human experiences. We, therefore, conclude our explorations of creativity and revelation with a mytho-empirical anchor of our theoretical model. Both our protagonists, Kierkegaard and Rabbi Nachman, have made public their revelatory Messianic experiences, and they have had to pay for their hübris by social ostracism, debilitating social stigmata, and life-long misery. Both the self-sacrificing creators like Van Gogh and self-victimizing prophets like Jan Hus break the barricades and melt the veils between the individual and the group whereas the false prophets, church rulers, and artistic power brokers break the ramparts between the individual and society. The authentic willing victimization of a Jesus Christ effects an éxtasis out of time and place and fuels the belief of millions in a continuing present. Likewise, the authentic sacrificial creativity of a Van Gogh made his art timeless and passes over group and institutional boundaries to fire the creative imagination of viewers and would-be artists in a timeless synchronicity from here to eternity. Seeing Is Believing: Hearing the Logos and Seeing with the Eye of Horus The epistemic barriers between man and his surroundings are legion. This is mainly related to the fallibility of human perception. Philosophically, the failings of the human senses has been expounded on by David Hume. We have shown elsewhere in a volume-length exposition the epistemic and cognitive obstacles to perceive whatever there is out there.211 Indeed, we are not concerned here with optical or visual illusions, such as the fact that the Muller-Lyer illusion shows the line with arrowheads pointing outwards to be shorter than the line with its arrowheads pointing inwards, although the two lines are of exactly the same length.212 We are concerned with the twisting of perception by motivation, needs, values, and personality differences. We are, however, interested by the fact that the sticks in the Muller-Lyer illusion appear to be of different lengths to different people and to the same person at different times and places. In this issue we side with the motivational approach to perception according to which we are very likely to misperceive because of a projection of needs and wishes on the stimuli. Consequently, we cannot adhere to the psycho-physical approach of</page><page sequence="114">224 God as the Shadow of Man Gibson and his disciples, which stresses the 'correspondence between certain mathematical properties of the retinal image and certain phenomenal variables of the visual world'.213 The psycho-physicist anchors on the stimulus with a scientific zeal for measurements, whereas we join the motivationists in trying to relate the individual's perceptual response to his needs and motives. Moreover, we hold that because Ego's motives and wishes, as determined by the dialectics of his personality core-vectors, largely determine his precepts and perceptual responses, they also play a crucial role in his interaction with his surroundings. To be more precise: our interest in Ego's value involvement with things, nature, and people makes us more concerned with the relationship between his motives and his perceptual responses than with the epistemic nature of the stimuli which impinge on his senses. There are, of course, some links between stimuli and their precepts which are not based on motivational pressures and their projections. These have been studied and supposedly measured by an impressive number of experimental psychologists, from G. Fechner to modern psychophysicians.214 We do not believe, however, that the non-motivational components of the perception can be effectively isolated from the motivated and projective ones, and then related separately to the stimuli. The science of man has not yet reached the level of sophistication to conduct the controlled experiments which are necessary for these kinds of measurements. Yet, we may carry on our reasoning and theorizing by assuming a given constancy of relationship between the stimuli and their non-motivated perception (which serve as a raw material for the final product of perception). This, in turn, is influenced and molded by the vast array of motivational and wish-based personality traits and cultural pressures. This assumption may be questioned by some scientific psychologists. Our defense is by reference to one of their own cherished assumptions: the behaviorist black box analogy of intrapsychic dynamisms which is very much like our present assumption about the consistencies of relationships between stimuli and their sensory perceptions. Even if there are some psycho-physical constancies in the relationship between stimulus and precept, they are bound to be twisted and remolded by the dynamics of the organism and the psyche. The form and quality of perception may be influenced by the intensity of the needs of the body, by some endocrine secretions, diseases, and drugs on the biological level, by developmental fixations and core personality characteristics on the psychological level, and by cultural imprints and social character traits on the social level. The complexity and variability of the configurations of these variables are so vast that the chances of one person having even a</page><page sequence="115">Epilogue and Overture 225 closely similar perception to the one perceived by another person of the same stimulus are very remote. Yet perceptual theory links meaning and reason to similarity.215 Consequently, the inevitable dissimilarity of perceptions makes the possibility of meaningful communication of precepts from one person to another sadly remote. Meaningfulness in the present context relates to the intersubjective domain and not to the mere mechanical transmission of symbols and signs. Worse still, even the meaningfulness of Ego's own perception is related, according to perception theory, to the resemblance of a given perception to a previous one. There is evidence that time differences may be related to different motivations, body chemistry, moods, and sex are also bound to influence the form and contents of the perception.216 Thus, the meaningfulness of a perception varies not only with the motivations, fixations, and cultural imprints on Ego's personality, but also on the time of perception by Ego himself. We may conclude, therefore, that the meaningfulness of Ego's perception is, not only non-communicable from the ontological point of view but in all probability also, statistically unique. This premise that perception is essentially a private language will have wide implications for our subsequent examination of Ego's ability to reach a meaningful dialogue with his surroundings. Our central thesis is that effective interpersonal communication is so unlikely that it borders on the impossible. This is so because Ego's cognition is related first of all to his biological potential, to his core personality fixations, to his peripheral personality parameters, and to the cultural imprints on his personality effected by socialization. The permutation of all these factors makes the cognition of Ego unique to himself and not shared by any other human being almost like his fingerprints. Consequently, there is no cognitive common denominator between Ego and Alter, and, even if there was, there are no adequate means of transmitting Ego's cognition to others. We assume that there are no effective direct means for intersubjective communication. Telepathy, even if it exists, is not developed and widespread enough to serve as an effective and universal means of interpersonal communication. Language operates on a very shallow level of encounter and is subject to the same twists and biases as other modes of cognition. To begin our argument we present the following model of dyadic interpersonal perception (figure 3.17):</page><page sequence="116">226 God as the Shadow of Man - Cognition Cognition S f Receiving Transmitting/ ' j response reponse / ' EGO ALTER V Cognition NCognition/ Transmitting stimulus Receiving stimulus Figure 3.17 Each stage of perception and response is subject to the biases and twists of both Ego's and Alter's cognition. The specific and virtually unique combination of Ego and Alter's cognitive processes intervene and stand between the reception and transmission of both stimuli and responses. As the cumulating and permutation of bio-psychogenic and socio-genetic factors make the twists and biases within the cognitive process unique for each person, the effective transmission of stimuli and responses on a common denominator of meanings between Ego and Alter is practically impossible. As for the value-laden attitudes and affects inherent in the cognitive processes of an individual, they are even less transmittable. The personality-and culture-bound attitudes and affects color each precept and cognition of Ego in hues and nuances peculiar to himself. They cannot be shared with Alter or communicated to him. The gist of our argument is first of all statistical, namely that the vast permutations of cognitive twists and biases, along with the combinations of effects and value judgments, make the cognition of Ego peculiar to himself and the possibility that they are shared by Alter is so remote that it is virtually non-existent. Second, all kinds of symbolic and non-verbal means of human communication are blunt, coarse, and inadequate tools for effecting an intersubjective rapport of meanings. Finally, Ego's psychological defenses and his congruity based longing for dialogue may create an illusion of communication. This illusion may constitute a further barrier against interpersonal communication because the illusion itself and its projection on Alter is peculiar to Ego and cannot be transmitted to Alter. Moreover, when this illusion of communication is projected onto the group, the collective, or society at large, it creates expectations by the individual from the group which are again peculiar to a given individual and are not shared by others. This makes for the vast heterogeneity of views as to the social and political functions of society and the inevitable rift between Ego's expectations from his membership and reference groups and the latter' s ability to fulfill them.</page><page sequence="117">Epilogue and Overture 227 The guideline for our analysis of the disjunctives in the process of dyadic communication is presented schematically as shown in figure 3.18: Transmission E@o s Ego's intended p. gap actual te- communication (Gl) transmission Reception - A Alter' s A»". A ► SS. ► cognition of PerceP^lon ^ ) Ego's transmission Figure 3.18 The first gap, denoted Gl, is between the communication which Ego meant to transmit and his actual communication. This gap may be related to a wide range of reasons. Some instances are that Ego lacks the necessary proficiency, verbal or non-verbal, in order to convey his meaning. Many times language or other means of communication available to Ego cannot depict or, hence, convey the depth of his emotions, the range of his ideas, or the subtlety and nuances of his meanings. In art, especially the performing arts, the artist may feel that he did not come through or that the music in his heart was not translated by his fingers into the music that actually emitted from the piano. Due to twisted perception and defense mechanisms of projection, displacement, pretense, illusion and elusion (double illusions boomeranging back at Ego),217 one may present a communication in a form and content quite different from the manner in which Ego intended to transmit it. The second gap, G2, relates to Ego's communication as stimulus and Alter' s twisted perception of it, due to biological, personality, and cultural factors. The third gap, G3, is the transformation of Alter' s precept by his cognitive processes and the biasing effects of his defence mechanism, personality peculiarities, and cultural imprints. The cumulative disrupting effects of these gaps on Ego's endeavors to communicate with Alter are brought home to Ego by Alter's dissonant reaction to his communication. Ego is then likely to experience a frustration because of this initial breakdown of communication. Man is motivated by his early developmental phases to be a congruity driven animal. Consequently, Ego is bound to try to overcome these gaps of communication (depending on his personality type) by either a séparant inclusionary effort to reach Alter by conveying his communication to him in an overpowering manner or by</page><page sequence="118">228 God as the Shadow of Man a participant exclusionary effort to achieve congruity by accepting Alter' s version of the communication as processed by him and fed back to Ego. When these congruity-based efforts to close the gaps in the process of dyadic communication fail, the breakdowns in the communication process are final and are recorded as such by Ego's psyche. The failure of dyadic communication is, of course, relative and varies in degree for every communication. Totally detached autistic psychotics are a very small minority in any human society. On the other hand, a mutually meaningful and successful dialogue borders on the miraculous. The middle range consists of near-failures, semi-failures, and partial dissonances. The main impediment to any measure of dialogue is that Ego is ever-motivated by his core personality vectors to achieve a deeper level of encounter with Alter and his contextual object than the level he deems himself to have achieved. This is the fate of man's Sisyphean ressentiment and Tantalic illusions that he ever chases a stone he cannot control or a communication he cannot achieve. However, the efforts of man to overcome the epistemic barrier between himself and his surroundings have been attempted by mythogenic means throughout the ages. These efforts are strongly related to the social character of the individuals attempting it. We shall, therefore, illustrate for our purposes the mythogenic efforts to overcome the epistemic barrier by means of the senses in the ancient Egyptian and the biblical Judaic social character. It would be useful to guide our analysis by a continuum as shown in figure 3.19: Judaic Egyptian social social character character Tantalic Sisyphean participant séparant perception perception by auditory by contextual directionality vision Figure 3.19 Thus, in Egyptian scripture, when Horus comes to look for his father Osiris, he sees Ra (the Egyptian chief deity) and he knows Ra.218 This direct epistemic visual exposure to God is seemingly anathema to the Mosaic conception of the abstract, unique God which was the antithesis to the polytheism of concrete Egyptian deities. Hence, original sin is</page><page sequence="119">Epilogue and Overture 229 direct exposure tö knowledge of God and, therefore, is considered to be the most heinous transgresson in both Judaism and Christianity. The visual organ occupies a central role in ancient Egyptian cosmology, mythology, and ritual. Egyptian cosmology identifies the sun and the moon as the two eyes of the falcon-god Horus. Thou art the God who came into being when no (other) God had yet come into existence, when no name of anything has yet been proclaimed. When thou openest thy eyes so as to see, it becomes light for everyone. The falcon radiating light from his eyes. The sun and moon are his eyes.219 This identification is somewhat peculiar. It confers upon the eye a function which is dissonant, if not opposite, to our present-day knowledge and way of thinking. We are accustomed to think of vision as the perception of light. However, from the cosmological statements above, it is clear that the Egyptian eye is no less a symbolical instrument of illumination than it is an organ of receiving light. The visual faculty of the god Horus is, at the very same time, a source of light radiation. His vision gives us our light. This conception of the eye as a light source, as an organ which actively participates in the creation of its own datum, is highly significant and deserves further attention. The sun and moon themselves occupy an immensely important role in Egyptian cosmology and mythology. The solar and lunar cycles of light and darkness are one of the essential bases, if not the fundamental one, to understanding the Egyptian preoccupation with the transformations between life, death, and resurrection. The rising of the sun, birth, ascension to the throne, victory, and the coming into being of light are intertwined to form a complex of partially related meanings in the Egyptian discourse. On the other hand, the dimming of light, the setting of the sun, death, and defeat are strongly associated together. The great, unfathomable abyss between life and death, and between reality and transcendence challenges each individual and every society with their respective cultures and religions to supply a satisfactory conception of what the bridge over this abyss might be. It is highly significant to our thesis that the specific conception supplied by the Egyptian religion to give meaning to the metamorphosis of life unto death relies so heavily on symbolism of light or its absence. The sun is life, and its rising means birth. Sunset means death, but as the sun returns to rise, life returns to rise in the ever-after. Life comes forth by day following a successful passage through darkness. Life is the presence of light. Death is the absence of it. Resurrection is the re-emergence of light. The two celestial luminaries, the sun and the</page><page sequence="120">230 God as the Shadow of Man moon, appear respectively in the day and the night. The fact that they are both symbolized as the two eyes of Horus transcends and resolves the seemingly unbridgeable gap between light and darkness and between life and death. The phenomenally shocking metamorphosis of human life into a human corpse, is, thus, made coherent within the transcendental face of the falcon-god, in which the sun and moon are equal partners. Indeed, it seems as if the universal medium, or ether, or space, in Egyptian cosmology is made of light. Where there is darkness, one cannot walk. The dead must be armed with the eye of Horus. The eyes of Horus, the fact of their co-presence within the same godhead, is far from taken for granted in Egyptian mythology. The universal continuity between life and resurrection has been symbolically secured and guaranteed not only through the resurrection of Osiris, but through the victory of Horus over Set, in the course of which Horus took possession of his eye or eyes unrightfully stolen from him by Set. It is customary to view the Osirian process as the essence of the Egyptian theory of eternal life, but, in truth, the Osirian process would be incomplete without the complementary significance of Horus and his eyes. Osiris is a one-way ticket to away and beyond. Osiris is the vehicle from reality to transcendence. But Horus, the son of Osiris, is the vehicle from transcendence to reality, and much of the complete, round trip, depends on his eyes. The story comes in numerous variations, but in all of them it is clear, that before or after Osiris is safely reconstituted, resurrected, and mounted on his rightful throne as king of the dead, there develops a cosmic battle, or conflict of some sort, between Horus, the son of Osiris, and Set, his sinister brother-shadow, in the course of which one of Horns' s eyes, or both of them, get stolen or damaged. The result is darkness. Absolute death, the sort of death which is not permissible in the Egyptian frame of mind, threatens to take hold of the universe. The exact manner of resolution of this threat varies from story to story, but in all of them the end result is the same: Horus regains possession of his eyes, and light returns to the world. A horrible threat on universal order is thus removed. In the next step Horus gives his eye to Osiris and, thus, complements the process of reconstitution. Horus's eye grants Osiris the gift of eternal life and the ability to rule the kingdom of the dead. The mythological picture here is somewhat incomplete. Common sense has it that Horus's gift to his father would leave the son blind again. But, as Budge convincingly demonstrates, the transfer of Horus's eye to Osiris does not damage Horus's own visual/enlightening faculty. How should we understand the meaning of the eye of Horus, in the context of this mythological array?</page><page sequence="121">Epilogue and Overture 23 1 We have two gods, father and son. The son loses his eye while avenging the death of the former, the loss constituting a universal catastrophe. The son wins his eye back, the catastrophe is averted. Then son transfers an eye to the dead father, who is thereby given powers of eternal life and authority. This time the transfer of the eye does not threaten the universal order. Indeed, it only strengthens it, since the eternal life and government of Osiris ensures the proper functioning of the crop cycle, to mention only one essential Osirian responsibility towards the human race. The eye, the visual sense, its image, symbolism and mythogenes are, therefore, the prime means by which the ancient Egyptians tried to bridge the epistemic rift between themselves and their surroundings. The eye has to bathe in humidity; the life-giving wetness of the Nile in order to survive. Hence, Seth, the evil Weidergeist symbolizing nihilation and death, is ever dry. Seth pushes his finger of dryness into the eye of Horus, and it dries and destroys it. But then Horus cries, and from his tears all human beings are created.220 Hence, humanity was conceived in pain and agony. This might well be linked to the notion of a blemished God in both Christianity and Luranic Kabbala whom man's duty is to help mend (tikkun). However, there is a daily resurrection of the sun and the day since Osiris, the god of death, gives Horus the eye and resuscitates, thereby, both him and the new day. Indeed, the Egyptians had eye-shaped saffron cakes, and their ingestion was like partaking of the host in Christianity. In all probability, there was a certain link between these two rituals: The eating of the symbolic eye of Horus sanctifies the eater, very much like the eucharist swallowed by the Christians. Also, Osiris eats the eye and is resurrected.221 In Egypt, the facts of life and resurrection are related to seeing and perceiving the concrete image. Per contra, in Judaism and sometimes in Christianity seeing is shunned as related to the visual concretizing image. Eidolon, an idol which stems from the Greek eidon (to see), is of course related to the heinous sin of idolatry both in Judaism and in Christianity. The medieval church proclaimed derisively: "Quod Legendibus Scriptura, Hoc Idiotibus Pietura". As the written word is to the literate, so is the picture to the illiterate - decreeing the supremacy of the Logos to the visual image. Indeed, Moses assures the children of Israel: 'Take ye, therefore, good heed into yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spoke unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.'222 The Mosaic God has no image he cannot be seen only heard. This, of course, is mytho-empiricized by the exhortation: 'Hear O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord'.223 The most important assertion of monotheism is related to abstract hearing and not to concrete seeing. Characteristically, the priests are sanctified by tipping</page><page sequence="122">232 God as the Shadow of Man their right ears with the blood of a sacrificial ram224 since it is with their ears that they have to receive the word of God. This is why the golden calf, the concrete visual image of an eidolon, was so starkly contrary to the essence of an abstract unseen and unseeable God. 4 Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me and live'.225 The God of Israel can only be heard. Mashma'ut (meaning in Hebrew) stems from the root to hear, which implies that meanings may be gleaned by hearing. Mishma'at - "obedience" in Hebrew - also stems from shma or hearing. Indeed, God commands Israel: 'Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people'.226 Here the hearing of the voice of God seems to be a condition precedent to the theophany of God of Israel, His agreement to be their God and to accept them as his people. In prayer, man calls, and God mercifully hears his prayer.227 The gist of our argument here is that, in directional Judaism, the inner revelatory conviction is effected maieutically through an inner voice which is taken to be divine. One cannot see himself interacting with one's surroundings and with other human beings; yet one can hear oneself in discourse with others. Hence, man who wishes to convey a directional meaning or norm projects onto others a sincere authentic exhortation with the intention that this other hears maieutically in his inner-self a resonant echo of Ego's exhortation. This is the attempt of Ego to cross the epistemic barrier between himself and Alter. To Dance with Particles Our final deliberation on a possible way to bridge over epistemic barriers will be a description of the possibility of crossing the rift between consciousness and matter which entails the crossing over from the classic into the quantum world. A volcano erupts and the earth revolves around its axis without knowing whether what they do or what happens to them is good or bad. Knowledge entails a complementarity relationship between man and physical systems both quantic and classic. This is apparent from the mytho-empirical interpretation of the myth of original sin which we have explained previously. The mytho-empirical method regards myths as, inter alia, a projection of developmental phases of the individual human being. Hence, the knowledge of original sin proscribed by the absolute directional abstract and unique God since he regards knowledge as his own prerogative, gained by interaction with a physical object, the apple. After the complimentarity interaction with the objects around him which gains his cognition ethical knowledge, the developing infant is able to distinguish between good and bad. Even before this when man was still in the Edenic non-differentiated phase of his development, he had the</page><page sequence="123">Epilogue and Overture 233 ability to label with a word the objects and life forms around him. This is epistemic knowledge, a purely cognitive intra-psychic dynamic which is followed by the interactional ethical knowledge of the original sin. Indeed, the word Logos is a prime directional tool. Moses, the inventor of directional ethics, lost his chance to enter the Promised Land because he smote the rock at the waters of Meribah instead of speaking to it to make it give forth water as ordained by God.228 This, indeed, is central to the directional creed. The Jews are the people of the word, the Logos, of the book whereas the gentiles and, especially, the Greeks act and use force to effect order, kosmos, in their contextual surroundings. Hence, Moses and Aaron committed sacrilege, and not just a trivial offense, by hitting the rock instead of talking to it. This mytho-empirical digression highlights the complementarity of ethics in the same way the observation effects a well-defined physical Eigenstate out of the probabilistic superposition of the wave function. This measurement interaction confers a physical definition and is, hence, meaningful to the stochastic diffusion of the Schrödinger wave function. This complementarity between observer and observed confers meaning on the measuring artifact and the physical system complex, not only according to the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics but also, according to the other major interpretations of the quantum measurement problem.229 If we take Von Neumann's mathematical formula, which described the collapse of Schrödinger wave functions into defined physical Eigenstate, we may point out the following problems. First, the Schrödinger wave function on which the probability of finding a particle is smeared, according to Born on the wave function and measured by the square of its amplitude, is linear and deterministic. The collapse of the wave function by the measurement of the quantum system as formulated by Von Neumann is stochastic and non-linear. Hence, there is a dynamic disconnectedness between the movement of the wave function and its collapse into a physical Eigenstate. A second point of criticism is that, according to Von Neumann, the collapse may be effected anywhere between the physical system and the brain of the observer, yet the dynamics are bound to be different if the collapsing measurement is effected by the measuring instrument or the observing brain. According to our reassessment of the Copenhagen Interpretation, a complimentarity relationship takes place between a meaning and a value endowing human psyche and quantum systems. The formation of a clearly defined physical phenomenon is as follows. The act of measurement plunges the measured quantum system, the measurement instrument as well as the observers' brain, into a superposition of states. This is the murky quantum soup of non-defined entangled probability waves and their squared amplitudes.</page><page sequence="124">234 God as the Shadow of Man The subsequent collapse of the wave function is carried out by a virtual particle originating in the human brain and engulfed by a hermetic force field. We denoted this force field hermetic after Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods, since its function is to link the cognition of the observer as contained in the measurement instrument (including the human brain) and the measured quantum system. The virtual particle has only a shadowy physical existence since it can violate the uncertainty barrier. The uncertainty relationship postulates h/2rc &lt;AEAT, where E is energy, T is time, and h is Plancks' constant. If AE is near to O, AT is moving towards oo. Hence, a virtual particle which has borrowed a minute amount of energy may exist for a relatively long time. As we do not grasp quarks, bossons, and gluons, but perceptible phenomena, the collapse of the wave function into a defined physical state is essentially a cognitive one. This is brought about by a hermetic force field cloning a virtual wave function, which engulfs the physical wave function like a cognitive halo. The cognitive collapse into a well-defined phenomenon does not affect either the physical system or the measurement apparatus which still remains in a superposition of states. The link between the cognitive system and the physical one is carried out by the hermetic force field through a maieutic resonance. The Socratic maieutic dialogical relationship was not foreign to Bohr, since it was expounded by Kierkegaard who influenced Hefding, Bohrs' friend. This maieutic relationship entails a mediating birth-giving trigger by the cognitive virtual particle and the hermetic force field. These clone a virtual wave function, which fits like a cognitive halo around the wave function. Then the cloned virtual wave function interacts with the wave function through a resonance. These nucleón resonances have proved to be excited, short-lived states that are momentary flirtations of a pion n -Mesons, the strong force-carrying particles binding the protons and neutrons together) with a nucleón (proton or neutron). In pion nucleón scattering, a pion can be caught in the momentary embrace of a nucleón; the two orbit each other briefly before separating once again. Think of two dancers coming together in a square dance, embracing warmly and swinging fondly before parting again and going on their way.230 This resonance minuet is the maieutic interaction by means of which the virtual cognitive collapse is effected and a minute quality of energy is transmitted to dent it in its superposed state so that whoever observes the physical state will perceive the same object. The resonance triggering a maieutic interaction between the cognition of the observer and the quantum system must result in a well defined observable stable for all observers. David Bohm's 'Hidden Variables' interpretation of quantum mechanics utilizes the point particle concept, which is very much like our</page><page sequence="125">Epilogue and Overture 235 virtual particle and is more of a cognitive entity than a physical one. Böhm envisages a Hamiltonian which evolves deterministically from initially known conditions. The pilot wave then chooses one branch of the probability density wave function and the other branches become, thence, ineffectual. Bohm's interpretation is realistic in the sense that, unlike the Copenhagen interpretation which postulates probabilistic relationships between the observer and the physical system, Böhm envisages real quantic processes among the measuring instrument, Hamiltonian wave, and physical system. Hence, Bohm's interpretation encounters Lorenz' s invariance and relativity problems. As we envisage a virtual collapse of the wave function which is largely cognitive, we do not encounter any relativity problems. The many worlds interpretation of Evertt and DeWitt has a science fiction aura. All the probabilities of the wave function materialize since each relationship between observer and observed does result in a well-defined Eigenstate, although in a world to themselves. Hence, there is no need for the wave function to collapse because all squared amplitudes of its probability wave are realized in a different space-time universe. Consequently, each measurement creates a separate world for the measurer, the measurement instrument, and the quantum system. The acute problem here is that if each observer disappears with the measurement instrument and the Eigenstate of the observed into a world of their own, what happens if the same observer and the same instrument measure another quantum system? Will they occupy another world completely cut off from the first? How then will persons keep a continuous stable identity if every single observation catapults them to a separate world? Also, the Schrödinger wave function does not contain any provisions for world splitting. Our interpretation would help the many worlds interpretation to evade some pitfalls since it envisages a dualism of consciousness and energy-matter. A hermetic force field sent by a particle originating in our consciousness clones the time-evolving Hamiltonian and leads the virtual particle to one wave packet whereas all the others became ineffective. Since this dynamic is cognitive and virtual and does not happen in the physical system each observer generates a different hermetic force field corresponding to his cognition. A variation on the theme of the many worlds' interpretation is the many minds interpretation of Albert and Lower. It postulates that each probability in the wave function has a corresponding state of mind and each probability materializes. Apart from the lack of the observer identity problem which is common to the many worlds and many minds interpretations, the many minds exposition is also vulnerable to the danger of solipsism since one observer functions as if his mind is the sole</page><page sequence="126">236 God as the Shadow of Man one in existence and unaware of other minds. If Albert and Lower had adopted our stance and synchronized it with theirs, they would not have succumbed to the dangers of solipsism. We postulate only one consciousness which is reflected kaleidoscopically in every life form. The resulting classical phenomenon, which is indeed a unique relationship between one mind and a physical system, is a cognitive reflection of the mind in the physical system, and does not preclude a similar cognitive reflection of another mind. Hence, the dangers of solipsism are avoided by means of our interpretation, and we also assure the continuous identity of the observer. The interpretation of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber postulates that there is a spontaneous collapse of the wave function of the measurement instrument into a particle which collapses by a domino effect the whole measurement instrument and, thence, the quantum systems. This happens because the measurement instrument is a macroscopic classic object big enough to have one of its particles collapse randomly and start the whole chain reaction, collapsing both the measurement instrument and the quantum system into a well-defined Eigenstate. The stochastic collapse is effected by the Gaussian (the normal) curve of the measuring instrument, which clones the wave function of the instrument which then collapses both the instrument and the quantum system. The problem here starts with the collapse, which poses relativistic inconsistencies. Also, the tails of the Gaussian curve never reach a zero, and, hence, the collapse cannot lead to a complete Eigenstate of a quantum system. Finally, Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber do not explain the domino effect by which the first collapsed particle collapsed all the others, both in the measuring instrument and in the quantum system. We try to solve these problems by envisaging a separate hermetic force field for each probability amplitude of each particle in the measurement instrument. The hermetic force field clones the Gaussian curve which takes the shape of the wave function of the instrument. Then the spontaneous collapse of a particle in the pointer occurs, the virtual particles which emanate from one consciousness transmit this information to all other hermetic force fields of the particles in the measuring instrument and quantum system. However, both the measuring instrument and the quantum system remain in superposition since the collapse of both the instrument and the quantum system are virtual and cognitive. In this manner we hopefully provide a more viable interpretation of quantum mechanics by utilizing a complementarity dynamic between consciousness and energy-matter. This basic duality of physics stems from Bohr's conviction that the basic duality between the observer and observed is the essential dyad of being. Indeed, if a relationship between an observer and a physical system</page><page sequence="127">Epilogue and Overture 237 is all there is - the minimum condition of ontology is a dyad between duality. This holds true, not only for physics but also for ethics as shown by the Dialogica philosophers, like Kierkegaard and Buber. In history, Croce and Colingwood assure us that history is generated by a relationship between the historian and his objects of study. Some major trends in religion and mysticism are patently dualistic like the various branches of Gnosticism and the Kabbala. Finally, evolution is effected by a relationship of the creature with his environment. Differentiation of forces and coagulation of matter came later. Indeed, Einstein's lifelong dream was to find a unified theory of physics. Although not entirely successful, Steven Weinber, Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashnow, and Stephen Hawking have made giant strides towards a unification of physical theory.231 Even if the grand unifying theories (GUTS) in physics have not succeeded up to now in incorporating gravity within their domain, the common, homogenous origin of all energy-matter is enough to contrast it with the historical and non-physical universal ani-consciousness. The next logical problem lies in trying to explain how, according to our model, energy-matter and consciousness are coupled together so as to form matter-particles, objects, and, eventually, life forms. In order to do this, we propose to return to the double-slit experiment and show how our interpretation differs from the Copenhagen interpretation. There are three actors in the double-slit experiment: the human-observer-experimenter, the classic measuring instrument which records the quantum event, and the observed quantum physical system. Man, the observer, and homo faber, the instrument maker , is, not only the most elaborate and sophisticated seat of the ani conscious but also, the most advanced connecting agent between consciousness and energy, the two basic dualities of creation. This he performs by means of the symbolon, the connecting structure. The original Greek symbolon signified an animal bone broken in the middle, with one half given to each of the two parties to the contract. The bone fibers were broken in a specific non-replicable manner and served as conclusive proof of partnership to the contract. In a similar manner, our symbolon as a connecting structure is also unique, insofar as it synthesizes the initial model of a phenomenon subsequently to be realized by an act of creation. We would like to point out the specific nature of our symbolon connecting structure. Our symbolon is all this except that its transformations do lead to outside components of the structure because it is a creative structure. Our symbolon triggers the creation of a phenomenon by synthesizing the ani-consciousness and the energy-matter as a means for the subsequent creation. More than anything else, man is a</page><page sequence="128">23 8 God as the Shadow of Man manufacturer of symboloi. Man's atzmi, his interactive self, synthesizes symboloi by connecting his ani-consciousness with well-defined or diffuse parts of his environment. Hence, each symbolon is dynamic, unique, and irreplaceable in another space-time configuration. As we have mentioned above, algorithms characterize computers as well as the contained consciousness of our measuring instrument. An algorithm is a programmed input which determines the function of a device. In this sense, an algorithm is the internal state of a device because it constitutes the inner specifications according to which a certain device should function.232 On the other hand, the indeterministic consciousnesses of creatures are not algorithmic because they are not computable. Penrose rightly says that creatures, especially man, have self-awareness, but that computers measuring instruments programmed by an algorithm to perform defined tasks do not and cannot have self-awareness.233 Searle has also shown that any machine, including the most sophisticated computer, does not have the faculty of understanding which man has. Hence, man is not just 'a computer made of meat', as Marvin Minsky quipped. 'The human mind', as Penrose says, 'is more than a collection of tiny wires and switches'. The communicative proficiency of the contained consciousness within an artifact operates through the symbolon structures ingrained in it by its creator. This communicative ability is necessary to substantiate our claim of an interdependence among the observer, the measuring instrument, and the quantum of the physical system. A contained vectorial consciousness is ingrained, for instance, into a work of art and, through it, is communicated to an observer. The Quanta Events The universe started from a singularity with the Big Bang and will end by reverting back to a singularity with the Big Crunch. This Sisyphean cycle is replicated in the birth and death of stars. It is not surprising that this dynamic was hypothesized by the Indian Chandrasekhar, whose tradition postulates Samsara cycles of creation, which are equivalent to our Sisyphean cycles relating only to matter and energy, because participant ani-consciousness is immutable and ahistorical. This notion of shrinking back into a singularity of infinite gravity and zero size was attacked by such giants of Occidental science as Einstein and Eddington, but Chandrasekhar was right. The dynamics of energy-matter are outbursts from singularities and sink back to them da capo ad infinitum. Singularities, however, cannot be observed. Not only are they outside</page><page sequence="129">Epilogue and Overture 239 space-time, but they are protected by black holes from which light cannot escape because of extreme gravity. These black holes are bordered by event horizons which form further barriers against the observation of singularities. This inability to detect, observe, and verify the existence of singularities led Penrose to expound the cosmic censorship hypothesis, according to which our programmer did not intend his creatures to be exposed to a singularity; hence, it is unobservable by man.234 We hold, following Koestler's holonic principle, that there is no reason to suppose that the Sisyphean cycles of energy-matter from singularity to singularity are confined to macro-events only. Singularities might well be the unobservable source of quantic energy and its final telos, from which another Sisyphean cycle will eventually sprout forth, in infinite Samsara incarnations. This sprouting of quanta energy from a potential was hypothesized by Heisenberg quite early on in quantum theory.235 Out of this potential, quanta energy spouts out in wavers and waves superpose. This is due to the additive nature of the wave amplitudes when interfering with each other. For de Broglie and Schrödinger, who conceived of particles as packets of waves, the superposition was of real waves, whereas for Born the waves were probabilities. They give the probability function of finding a particle at a given position by acquiring the amplitude of the probability wave at that position. These probability waves also superpose as described by Dirac as follows: When a state is formed by the superposition of two other states, it will have priorities that are in some vague way intermediate between those of the two original states and that approach more or less closely to those of either of them according to the greater or lesser weight attached to this state in the superposition process. The new state is completely defined by the original states when their relative weights in the superposition process are known, together with a certain phase difference, the exact meaning of weights and phases being provided in the general case by the mathematical theory. In the case of the polarization of a photon their meaning is provided by classical optics, so that, for example, when two perpendicularly plane-polarized states are superposed with equal weight the new state may be circularly polarized in either direction, or linearly polarized at an angle 1/471, or else elliptically polarized, according to the phase difference.236 The non-classical nature of the superposition process is brought out clearly if we consider the superposition of two states, A and B, such that there exists an observation which, when made on the system in state A, is certain to lead to one particular result, say a, and when made on the</page><page sequence="130">240 God as the Shadow of Man system in state B, is certain to lead to some different result, say b. What will be the result of the observation when made on the system in the superposed state? The answer is that the result will be sometimes a and sometimes ò, according to a probability law dependent on the relative weights of A and B in the superposition process. It will never be different from A or B. The intermediate character of the state formed by superposition thus expresses itself through the probability of a particular result for an observation being intermediate between the corresponding probabilities for the original states; the result itself is not intermediate between the corresponding results for the original states.237 Born's probability waves and Dirac's formulation of their superposition are both a staple of the Copenhagen interpretation. But how can probability waves imprint an interference pattern on the photographic plate in the double slit experiment?! Only real waves can do this. The Copenhagen interpretation gives a viable mathematical exposition of the superposition of the probability amplitudes of finding particles in given positions, but it refrains from stating anything about the reality represented by this mathematical formalism. Penrose introduces some sophisticated mathematical formalism to denote the spreading out of a particle over large regions of space,238 to describe the evolution of the wave function over time. He claims that the wave function's reality is represented by its amplitude, while, at the act of measurement, this amplitude turns into a classical probability, which, incidentally, is one of Bohr's claims in his exposition of the Copenhagen interpretation. It is hard to see why Dirac's denotation of energy waves superposed as vector states in quantum linear superposition is probabilistic, whereas Penrose's amplitudes of a particle smeared out over a large region of space are real. To us, they seem as probabilistic as an amplitude of a spread momentum. Until an act of measurement has dragged out the superposed energy into quantum reality, we are dealing with probabilities, whatever the elegance of their mathematical formalism. The decision to detect a particle collapses the probability waves. This is not specific to quantum mechanics, but stems from probability theory, according to which a certain result, such as the measurement of a particle which renders its probability one, reduces all their other probabilities to zero. The collapse of the probability function relates only to the Copenhagen interpretation. If we adopt the realistic de Broglie-Schrödinger interpretation, together with our conception of a vectorial consciousness contained within the measuring instrument, the measurement act drags out the energy necessary to form a particle from the superposition of waves. This is not unlike the measuring or dragging out of one color from white, which is the superposition of all colors. The</page><page sequence="131">Epilogue and Overture 24 1 problem of the Copenhagen interpretation is where to cut the measurement chain, or, more specifically, is where the superposition of probability waves collapses: whether before the measurement instrument, after it, or in the observer's brain, does not arise in our interpretation. We hold that the ani-consciousness, being ahistorical and attributeless, cannot be and is not in a superposition with waves. Hence, the superposition stops at the measuring instrument, which has a contained consciousness and certainly cannot engulf the human observer. Hence, the so-called Wignes's friend paradox cannot be applicable to us. The paradox is as follows: [the observer] was in a state of suspended animation before he answered [the] question. It follows that the being with a consciousness must have a different role in quantum mechanics than the inanimate measuring device. In particular, the quantum mechanical equation cannot be linear if the preceding argument is accepted. This argument implies that 4 my friend' has the same types of impressions and sensations and, in particular, that, after interacting with the object, he is not in that state of suspended animation which corresponds to the wave function. It is not necessary to see a contradiction here from the point of view of orthodox quantum mechanics, and there is none, if we believe that the alternative whereby my friend's consciousness contains either the impression of having seen [a live cat] or of having seen a [dead cat] is meaningless. However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of my friend to this extent is surely an unnatural attitude approaching solipsism, and few people, in their hearts, will go along with it.239 We also postulate a limit, a Greek horos or barrier, between the classic and quantum worlds. This barrier, represented by Heisenberg' s uncertainty relations, does not allow more than a single glimpse of related phenomena behind the barrier. Hence, the superposition of quantum waves themselves cannot be measured. We can record either their interference pattern or the particle created from them by the interaction of the symbolon structure embedded in the measuring instrument and the super-imposed quanta energy. It should be stressed that the interference pattern is recorded when there was no intention to record a particle. Thus, the interference pattern is the more basic state of the superposition of waves. Only when the vectorial symbolon needed to create a particle comes into contact with the superimposed waves is the particle created and recorded. The superposition of waves might not necessarily have disappeared from the observed quantum physical system; it just cannot be observed because of the uncertainty barrier. Hence, the singularity is a potential for energy waves, and the superposition of waves is a potential</page><page sequence="132">242 God as the Shadow of Man for particles. Thus, the hierarchy of the quantic phenomena vis-à-vis the uncertainty barrier might be presented as shown in figure 3.20: S eparant Participant ^ Particle ^ ^ unguilty barrier p^"¡" Singularity PH ^ ^ of waves symbolon vectorial structure Figure 3.20 The singularity, unobservable within the quantum world, is the potential of superposed waves. These are behind the uncertainty barrier superposition, which manifests itself by a séparant, measurable, and measured physical Eigenstate. This is why Dirac's denotation of quantum linear superposition, which stands for a complex vector space, combines real and imaginary non-observable number entities. Indeed, complex numbers are particularly suitable for our purposes because our dualistic model combines the non-measurable participant ani-consciousness with largely measurable séparant energy-matter. These two divergent entities are integrated both in the connecting symbolon structure and the ultimate Promethean holon, be it a life form or an artifact. To represent the symbolon structure, the Promethean holon and the processes leading to them, one must use complex numbers, as presented by an Argand plane as shown in figure 3.21 : Á k y Imaginary axis X z y y Q j R e a 1 a x i s The Argand plane, depicting a complex number z = x + i y . Figure 3.21240 Thus, a particle passing through both slits at once cannot be represented, except by complex numbers combining both real and imaginary ones. In a</page><page sequence="133">Epilogue and Overture 243 similar vein, the converging encounter between the evolving determinist-time linear Schrödinger equation of superposed waves and the indeterministic measurement act resulting in a particle eigenstate can be represented only by complex numbers combining real, séparant processes and imaginary, non-measurable participant dynamics. An Act of Creation The Copenhagen interpretation does not really relate to the underlying dynamics of the wave-particle duality of energy-matter. 'The paradoxes of the dualism between the wave picture and particle were not solved', said Werner Heisenberg. 'They were hidden somehow in the mathematical scheme'.241 However, we do wish to relate to the processes by which particles are created from the superposed waves behind the uncertainty barrier of quantum events. The Copenhagenists' contention that the act of observation not only infuses energy onto the observed quantum event, thus, biasing its momentum and position measurements, but possibly also in itself, creating a particle, is only partially true. The detector which counts particles in the double-slit experiment does not infuse any energy into the observed quantum event; yet we claim that the contained vectorial consciousness inherent in the symbolon structure embedded in the particle detector, which is intended to count particles, does actually create them. This it does by a dialectical encounter with the superposed energy waves behind the uncertainty barrier in the quantum world. We have already hinted that the uncertainty barrier is not partial to waves or particles. If one passes the barrier, the other cannot, and vice-versa. However, an undisturbed state of motion, which, in quantum mechanics (QM) terminology, stands for the undetected superposed flow of waves within, for example, the double-slit experiment, will emit an interference pattern of superposed waves, which will accordingly be recorded, on the photographic plate. This will change the moment the symbolon structure in the counting detectors interacts with the superposed waves in the undisturbed state of motion to create particles. Once the contained consciousness of the particle detector is removed, the undisturbed state of motion is again enabled by the uncertainty relations to record an interference pattern. Not that the superposed waves disappear from the quantum world. They are just not allowed to pass the uncertainty barrier once the particle detector is operating. The particle and wave are quantically complementary; hence, only one can pass the uncertainty barrier, but this complementarity has a much deeper significance for us than for the Copenhagen interpretation, as we shall presently see. One can</page><page sequence="134">244 God as the Shadow of Man regard the superposed waves in the quantum world as raw material or raw energy for the creation of a particle, such as a Promethean holon (PH). We have seen that the particle, as a PH, results from the interaction of the raw energy with the consciousness of the symbolon structure contained within the particle detector. Hence, as we have already pointed out, the measuring instrument is the one to collapse the wave probability function. However, in our model, it does more than that. With its contained vectorial consciousness, it forms the symbolon structure with which it reaches out to the superposed waves of energy in the physical system and creates a particle by a vectorial act of observation. Man the observer cannot do this anymore. Once he has relegated the act of observation to the instrument and imparted to it his contained consciousness, he is functus officio and cannot intervene any more, as a deus ex machina in the act of particle observation and particle creation by measurement. Man can fly to the moon only through the mediation of a space probe, and he can reach the quantum world only through the particle counter. The ani-consciousness is not within space-time and cannot be found in a wave superposition. Hence, it can interact with energy matter only through the mediation of the Tantalus Ratio as ingrained in the symbolon structure. The famous, or rather notorious, Schrödinger cat paradox stated in the words of the master himself runs as follows: A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following diabolical device (which must be secured against direct interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of radioactive substance, so small that perhaps in the course of one hour one of the atoms decays, but also, with equal probability, perhaps none; if it happens, the counter tube discharges and through a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of hydrocyanic acid. If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The function of the entire system would express this by having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts.242 For us, this paradox resolves itself by imparting a contained vectorial consciousness to the measuring instrument - in this case, the Geiger counter - which collapses the probability function of cp = 1/V2 (cp dead + cp alive) into the certainty of a dead or live cat. The act of creating a particle is executed by the symbolon structure of the measuring instrument dragging out energy from behind the quantum barrier to interact with the contained consciousness within it. But what is</page><page sequence="135">Epilogue and Overture 245 the nature of this barrier which divides the classic and quantum worlds? We might as well begin by considering the speed of light, which is a constant (299 792.5 kilometers per second) and forms the basis of the special theory of relativity engulfing spatio-temporality. Objects approaching the speed of light would become shorter for an outside observer until they disappear riding on a ray of light. Time slows down for the observer watching objects approaching the speed of light until it stops when riding a light beam. Thus, the speed of light as a barrier of history would seem to imply that in order to exist in spatio-temporality as a four-dimensional object, one must stay within the limits of the speed of light. The barrier dividing the classic four-dimensional world contained by the speed of light which cannot be exceeded and the QM world is Planck's constant, which lies at the basis of Heisenberg' s uncertainty principle. This constant relates energy to frequency, so that h is a constant of action, which specifies that allowed frequencies of light packet or quanta, emitted in Planck's case by a heated blackbody radiation in which a very small number is negligible in macro-classical physics, while in micro-physical events it specifies the frequencies allowed to pass through the uncertainty barrier. Indeed, Heisenberg' s uncertainty principle is expressed in terms of Planck's constant as (AE)-(AT)= h, where E is energy and T is time. Hence, if we measure E accurately, we cannot measure time and vice-versa. However, as h is a constant of action, it is expressed in terms of energy and time. Yet it seems to engulf the micro- world of quantum events, jealously guarding its secrets like the cherubim with their flaming swords guard the entrance to heaven. The constant of action lets out only one item of information at a time and suppresses the information on its complementary item. Thus, our ability to know and observe quanta events is precarious and uncertain. The ability to predict events in the macro-world deterministically does not apply to the quantum world. We cannot predict the future state of a quantum event from its present state. Schrödinger and Born provided us with a probability wave, the intensity of which at a given region gives us the probability spread, smear, or smudge of the occurrence of a quantum event. Quantum phenomena are sometimes waves and sometimes particles, and we have no way of knowing how the energy waves are superposed behind the uncertainty barrier. The spin, the angular momentum of particles, is also a sui generis phenomenon peculiar to the quantum world. The particles do not really revolve around their axis. The particles which constitute matter are those which have a spin of 1/2, i.e., they must revolve twice in order to have the same face to us. Force particles are those with spin 0, which look the same in all directions, those with spin 1, which must revolve 360° to</page><page sequence="136">246 God as the Shadow of Man present the same face, and those with spin 2, which must turn 180° to present to us the same face. Finally, virtual particles, like force-carrying particles, e.g., gravity, mediated by virtual gravitons, electro-magnetic force, mediated by the virtual photons, the weak force, mediated by virtual vector bosons, and the strong force, carried by virtual gluons, cannot be detected by particle detectors because they cheat the uncertainty barrier and perform their task in a time too short to be detected. Thus the micro-world is less real, less tangible, and less deterministic than the macro-world. The quantum world is aptly enclosed within an uncertainty barrier. It is the no-man's land, the twilight zone, between the being of the macro-world and the nothingness as wholeness, of the potential of ain, of the singularity. The latter cannot be observed. It is bounded by an event horizon which protects the phenomenality of the singularity. The quantum world is only partially latent. If we carry our holonic metaphor to the extreme, we might say that the quantum world is the meta-symbolon structure connecting the potential of the ani-singularity to the macro-world of classical physics. A Quantum Houdini The quantum barrier, as we have seen, is only partially, or rather selectively, closed. Particles can perform an Houdini act and jump over a barrier, or rather disappear and materialize on the other side of the barrier. This phenomenon is termed tunneling and is at the basis of both the electronic microscope and the decay of a nucleus due to the tunneling out of it of an alpha particle. Tunneling is based on the ability to perform a confidence trick on the uncertainty barrier. Time and energy are related to Planck's constant as follows: h/27i&lt; AE-AT, where E is energy and T is time. Hence AT &gt; h/27c®AE. Thus, a particle can borrow energy to get over a quantum barrier so long as it repays it within the time of h/2rc®AE. This is short indeed, but sufficient, if the materialization on the other side of the barrier is quick enough. However, the most widespread border cheating in the quantum world, and the one which we intuitively perceive as most relevant to our present context, is that one which we intuitively perceive as most relevant to our present context, is that done by the virtual particles we mentioned earlier. These virtual particles are force-carrying bosons with angular momentum of 0, 1, 2. The Fermion particles with spin 1/2 are subject to Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which no two-matter particles can occupy the same physical state. Force-carrying bosons, on the other hand, can be crammed together. More important, a light, massless, virtual photon carrying the</page><page sequence="137">Epilogue and Overture 247 electromagnetic force can cheat the uncertainty relationship for a longer distance and for more time. This, in contrast to a heavy virtual particle like the gluon mediating the strong nuclear force, which can cheat the uncertainty principle for only a short distance and a very short time. Virtual particles, as specialized border-smugglers, are, thus, admirably suited to carry our symbolon structures, and we shall describe presently our hypothesis as to how they do so. The virtual graviton photons, vector bosons, and gluons mediate all the forces of nature by being emitted and absorbed by matter particles. This transmission for the electro-magnetic force is shown in figure 3.22: Figure 3.22 Their ephemerality, as far as the macro-world is concerned, makes virtual particles more amenable to interact with the contained symbolon consciousness within the measuring instrument. Our hypothesis is that the séparant non-detectable and, hence, virtual energy component within the TR of the symbolon structure embedded in the measuring instrument is the communication agent for reaching a virtual particle in the observed physical system. Both particles interact and, thereby, transmit information or particle formation instructions. The crucial point, however, is that this information is in itself already a synthesis between the energy inherent in the atzmi, the interactive self or the Buberian I-it, and the ani-consciousness within the symbolon structure of the measuring instrument. This symbolon structure, which integrates the seeds of both epistemology and ontology, transmits these integrated messages and triggering instructions over to the observed physical system. There are</page><page sequence="138">248 God as the Shadow of Man two important dynamics at work here, which lie at the heart of our existentialist interpretation of QM: (A.) A dyadic dialogical integrative interaction takes place within the symbolon structure contained within the measuring instrument between a séparant component of virtual energy-matter and the ani-consciousness. (B.) The ani-consciousness, which, because it is ahistorical, permits instantaneous communication. Our first postulate is based both on our exposition of the TR and on the nature of virtual particles. We have pointed out that within its synaptic junctions, the TR integrates the participant longing of the Tantalic vector to regain the totality of the ani-consciousness and the séparant quest of the Sisyphean vector to revert to the omnipotence of the ani energy potential (singularity). Neither the Tantalic nor the Sisyphean vectors can fulfill their teleological aims, and, hence, they constitute the prime mover. The nature of both Tantalic and Sisyphean vectors as continua are of crucial importance. To express this in Buberian terms, both the I-thou and I-it contain components of both consciousness and energy-matter. In our terms, the Tantalic vector has mostly participant ani-oriented components, but also has some interactive components epistemologically oriented towards objects and energy-matter. The TR may, thus, be presented graphically as shown in figure 3.23: Barrier Participant vector ^ ^ Synaptic . . Interaction Ani- . . consciousness Barrier Ani ^ potentiality Séparant vector Figure 3.23 The barriers signify the inability of the vectors to regain their teleological aims, which lends continuity to their actions. When this TR is structured within the symbolon, it constitutes the connecting medium between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter. The full dynamics of our model may be seen in figure 3.24:</page><page sequence="139">Epilogue and Overture 249 séparant ear|y orality. birth irt. development social later orality birth irt. participant interaction individuals pantheism _ of individua with an ^ and society ego-boundary ^ " ^ " """ ont )logy • - - " bar ier ■- - • ani- "reaI" consciousness particles symbolon ģ i a I -^--structure tartalic v;ctor w an :hored o i ani di ectional T sisyph an ahistorical A,0mS U communication chen istry y macro barier ^¡n interactions ur certainty egislen »krgy - ' _ -barier ^ singularity Big Bang séparant classical quantum development world world participant Figure 3.24 The upper part of our model represents the development of individuals, stemming from the ani singularity. For the sake of convenience, we shall begin the analysis of our model from the second column. The symbolon structure is situated within a quantum world swarming with superposed waves and virtual particles. The ephemerality of this world is parallel to the early orality-anchored ephemerality on the Tantalic vectors of the human personality. The Tantalic vectors operating on the early oral subconscious layers of the ani-consciousness become structured within the TR and the symbolon, where they interact and become integrated with the virtual particles, which are potentialities as far as the classical world is concerned. The latter are kept within the quantum world by the barrier of the uncertainty principle. However, as we have seen, these virtual particles are professional go-betweens, mediators, and messengers. To mediate between forces, they can cheat the uncertainty barrier and interact with the ani-consciousness within the symbolon structure. They are, therefore, the most suitable communicative agents, together with the ani-contained consciousness, for triggering the potentialities of superposed waves and other virtual particles into a Promethean holon, a real, measurable, and recorded particle which may then become the building block of the real classical world. Of crucial importance is column 1 in our model, which presents the potentialities of both the .ani and the ain singularities, on which our core Tantalic and Sisyphean vectors are anchored. Behind the ontological and epistemic barrier, the pure ani-consciousness and the ain potentialities may exchange information directly and instantaneously because they are outside space, time, and locality (physics terminology for causality). Hence, the Tantalic vector,</page><page sequence="140">250 God as the Shadow of Man anchoring on the ani, and the Sisyphean vector, stemming from the ain, can interact through their ahistorical sources, instantaneously and non-locally, provided they are still in their seed form within the pantheistic and ephemeral symbolon structure. This is because the possibility of communication between the ani-consciousness and energy-matter decrease with each column. In ahistorical column 1, communication is direct, instantaneous, and non-local. In column 2, it can only be effected within the TR as structured within the symbolon. In the real world of column 3, we have individuals, both human (and other life forms imbued with freedom of choice) and energy-matter individuals such as real particles imbued with contained consciousness. The communication in column 3 can only be dialogical. For humans this is possible, but Buber tells us that dialogical communication borders on the miraculous. In particles, dialogical interaction takes place as resonances which Riordan describes poetically. 'These nucleón resonances have proved to be excited, short-lived states that are momentary flirtations of a pion which can be caught in the momentary embrace of a nucleón; the two orbit each other briefly before separating once again. Think of two dancers coming together in a square dance, embracing warmly, and swinging fondly, before parting again and going their way'.243 Another dialogical interaction between particles takes place when they interact initially and then fly apart. Relevant examples include the EPR thought experiment, in which pairs of photons are correlated within their positron atom source and are then fired in opposite directions. Also, in Bell's inequality experiment, as well as in the double-slit experiment, particles are fired from the same source and interact before flying out. In these cases - and here is the punchline - the initial interaction makes for a mutual ani and ain, so that they have a common symbolon structure. Thus, the questions are: How does the flying particle in the double-slit experiment know that the other slit is open or closed, and how does one particle in the EPR of Bell experiment know about the spin or polarization of its twin particle. These are readily answered. The communication between initially correlated particles, which have a common symbolon structure, is carried out through the underlying ani and ain sources of the séparant and participant vectors in the TR of the symbolon structure. The communication is, thus, instantaneous and non-local. This instantaneous communication can be much more widespread than one might initially expect because a great many acts of creation in nature start, as we have already mentioned, from a correlated interaction.</page><page sequence="141">Epilogue and Overture 25 1 Roger Penrose argues that this non-local communication between particles, both in the EPR thought experiment and in the Bell and Aspect type of experiment, makes the correlated particles dependent and non-separated entities.244 He does not, however, offer an explanation as to how this faster-than-light communication takes place from the superposed wave amplitudes (Penrose U) to the collapse of the wave function into an Eigenstate of position, momentum polarization, or spin (Penrose R), depending on the type of experiment. Indeed, such an explanation is impossible unless one assumes, as we do, a non-spatial, non-temporal, and acausal - i.e., non-local - synchronic, holistic entity like the ani-consciousness, which serves as the immediate link between physical states of energy-matter. The time differences also do not constitute a problem since the time arrow with its relativistic effects starts to move only in columns 3 and 4 of our model. In column 2, behind the uncertainty barrier, time is either partially fuzzy or nonexistent, whereas column 1 is ahistorical. Column 4 is the demiurgical I-it relationship of the individual and the group, in which an authentic I-thou dialogue is impossible and discourse is either on a routine or power-based level. The diagonal lines dividing the upper and lower parts of our model signify the continuum nature of the séparant-participant structure of both consciousness organisms and energy-matter structures. The Creative Intercourse The virtual particles within the symbolon do find an epistemic outlet from the classic world by cheating the uncertainty barrier for a short period of time, which is inversely related to their energy. They also have an epistemic way of communicating with other particles by absorption and emission. A virtual particle may combine with another virtual photon in the cloud surrounding an electron to create a pair of real particles. A photon may jump over the uncertainty barrier and borrow energy on the other side, creating an electron-positron pair - all this for a very short while within the limits allowed by the uncertainty relations - and then combine back into a photon. A virtual photon may be exchanged by one of the quarks in the proton or electron. This is the basic exchange between a virtual force-carrying boson, undetectable in the real world, and a quark, the most basic Fermion energy-matter particle, also undetectable in the real world. These virtual processes, although brilliantly described by Richard Feynman diagrams replete with conceptual (but not realistic) jumps back and forth in time (although undetectable in the real world), are represented in column 3 of our model. Yet, precisely because of the</page><page sequence="142">252 God as the Shadow of Man virtuality and ephemerality of these processes, they are admirably suited to be the communicative agent within the symbolon structure. We must stress again that our model does not ascribe any magical occult faculties to energy-matter à la Fritjoff Capra. We do accept that energy-matter particles, although virtual, must fully obey the ananké, the coercion of the rules of nature, as formulated by theoretical and experimental quantum physics. Our present endeavors just exploit to the hilt the Copenhagenists' idea of co-opting consciousness with energy-matter, as the co-creators of physical reality. The Copenhagenists did not wish to think out the psychological, phenomenological, and existentialist implications of this co-option, nor could they have, whereas we at least try to do so. The gist of our argument is that the virtual processes, as structured within the symbolon, are transmitted together with the participant ani-consciousness, which interacts with the virtual energy within the connecting structure. The ani-consciousness, which is outside history, is given a free ride in and out of spatio-temporality by the virtual-particles, and, thus, together they create matter and artifacts. The ani-consciousness appears to give the order to create a particle, but it is the virtual particle within the Tantalus Ratio of the symbolon structure which actually passes over the message to other particles (virtual, real, or anti) and to waves in quantic superposition and triggers the act of creation. The symbolon structure is both the blueprint (seed), the messenger, and catalyst of the act of creation, while the end product is a synthesis of energy and consciousness, as a PH which is the basic building unit of the whole of creation. Hence, we do not need the superrealist image of solitons as particles structured out of crests of localized, yet mobile, solitary waves,245 in order to solve the double-slit paradox. Our particle is a novel synthetic creation, a PH intended and ordained by consciousness and executed by energy as a common endeavor through the mediation of the symbolon structure. If we compare our interpretation with other endeavors to solve the quantum world paradoxes, we might find support for them in Bell's hidden variable hypothesis as vicariously formulated by Heinz Pagels: We have described the experiment and Bell's inequality in some detail because it is rather elementary and illustrates the crux of quantum weirdness. Bell was motivated to find a way of testing if there are hidden variables that exist out there in the world of rocks, tables, and chairs. He showed that the violation of the inequality by quantum theory did not necessarily rule out an objective world described by hidden variables, but the reality then represented had to be non-local. Behind quantum reality, there could be another reality described by these hidden variables, and in this reality there would be influences that move</page><page sequence="143">Epilogue and Overture 253 instantaneously an arbitrary distance without evident mediation. It is possible to believe that the quantum world is objective - as Einstein wanted - but then you are forced into accepting non-local influences - something Einstein, and most physicists, would never accept.246 We relate to Bell's hidden variable hypothesis for illustrative purposes only, since a more elaborate hidden variable hypothesis has been developed by David Böhm.247 Our ani-consciousness is, indeed, the kind of hidden variable needed to account for the non-locality of Bell's inequality infringement. This is rather significant because of Bell's centrality in recent developments in quantum mechanics, theoretical and experimental. We have mentioned Everett's248 and De Witt's249 many worlds hypothesis, according to which all the probabilities in Schrödinger' s wave function, the particle and wave alternatives, and the spin up and spin down alternations of the EPR thought experiment materialize, but in different worlds. These many worlds are not linked, as in the 'monads have no windows' of Leibnitz. We do not accept this absolute separation, since the quantum world as represented by column 2 of our model and the ahistorical potentialities of column 1 are interlinked and interconnected. Only the real, classic, and macro-pluralities are disconnected, but, even in them, a miraculous Buberian dialogue may occur and a flow of grace sometimes radiate to a crowd from an authentic performer like Jacques Brel. Particles, objects, and life forms as presented in columns 3 and 4 of our model are indeed secluded by the boundaries around them, but windows may be found perchance through which virtual energy, dialogue, and grace may interchange. This dialogue might lend meaning to the ani-consciousness as well as to the energy-matter, objects, and life forms interacting with it. Our interim conclusion is that authentic revelation and creativity might link us to other people, objects, and energy-matter as well as to transcendence and may perchance extricate us from the meaninglessness of an absurd existence. The Overture Summing up our rather long deliberations is not easy, but necessary. We call our stock-taking an overture since all summations serve as a stepping stone to further enigmas to explore. We initiated our exploratory study of myths by utilizing the ingenious insight of Claude Lévi-Strauss that myths are structures connecting nature to culture. We claimed for our mythogenes much more, since mythology</page><page sequence="144">254 God as the Shadow of Man sanctifies history, by introducing God into it. Also mythogenes link subject and object, individuals to their membership groups, and consciousness to energy-matter. A mythogene, as a generating structure, follows first of all Bergson' s notion of élan vitale, life as a self-generating dynamic. Piaget was so impressed with Bergson' s insight that he conceptualized a self-generating, self-sustaining dynamic which suits our notion of a mythogene: a generating myth. A mythogene is ahistorical. Indeed, there is no historical record of Moses, an Egyptian prince, who led a massive slave revolt in Egypt. Yet this myth was structured into a religion and still fuels the Judaic ethos to this day. A mythogene is also a symbolon, a connecting structure in the Greek sense. The Torah, for instance, was God's tool, according the Midrash, for the creation of the world. As the act of creation is continuous, so the Torah as a creative mythogene is also timeless. We propose to summarize our deliberation on mythogenes by surveying its ontological, existential, and relational aspects, relying mostly on Judaic mythogenes. We might as well start our ontological survey by examining the nature of the Mosaic deity, denoted as ' Eheyeh Asher Eheyeh' or 'I am that I am'. This is, indeed, an abstract, non-spatial mythogene, in contrast with the concrete Egyptian deities against which Moses presumably rebelled. It is also diametrically opposite to the Greek conception of tangible deities. The Judaic conception of an abstract deity influences Judaism's whole ethos. World in Hebrew, olam, is related to Healem, non-being, whereas the corresponding Greek concepts are kosmos, ordered universe, related to cosméticos, or contextual aesthetics. This might account for the largely non-aesthetic Judaic ethos and its negation of concreteness and proscription of graven images. Still, in Judaism god is spaceless: he is nowhere and everywhere. Hence, the spaceless Mosaic God is a mythogenic nothingness who is a potential for everything. Existentially Eheyeh Asher Eheyeh is synchronic, timeless, in contradistinction with Cronos or, as some denote the son of Uranus, time who eats his children, implying a temporal diachronic passage which passes from the future to the past and, thus, negates itself. By being synchronic, it negates the temporal cycles and pagan fertility rites. The Greek Tesmophoria and the Demetrian and Dionisian procreation rituals depict the impregnation, growth, death, and resurrection by actually emulating the cycles of nature. In the process, the mystriarchs and bacchants, participants in the fertility rites, commit incest, idolatry, kill the sacred king, and eat his flesh. Hence, incest, idolatry, and murder have become, by exclusion, the capital sins of Judaism. It is characteristic that the ultimate salvation in Judaism is related to a synchronic éxtasis from the diachronic sequences of time: 'And it shall come to pass in that day', says Zechariah, 'known to the</page><page sequence="145">Epilogue and Overture 255 Lord which is not day not night'.250 In that synchronic éxtasis, man and all creation shall be liberated from the diachronic fetters of time. The authentic relational dialogue is between the Logos, the word of God, and the maieutic acceptance of God's word in man's inner-self. This dialogue is essential in Judaism. The Mosaic God speaks whereas the pagan god acts. Hence, the gross transgression of Moses at the waters of Meriba: instead of talking to the rock, he struck it in a pagan manner. That transgression of Moses was heinous enough to punish him by not permitting him to enter the Promised Land. The mythogenic primacy of the word in Judaism is related to the importance of the audible sense, in contrast with the visual, which is of paramount importance in Egyptian and Greek mythology. The synchronic essence of God is imbued in the burning bush mythogene in Judaism which links the divine fire of transcendence with the temporality of the bush. Not so in Greek mythology, where Prometheus must bring the fire down from the mountain of Olympus to another dimension of space and time where mortals dwell. Since man prays to God in words which are pregnant with grace, the accosting of God in authentic prayer creates the presence of the wholly other, the universal thou. Hence, an authentic dialogue between man and transcendence actually generates divinity; therefore, as the Ba'al Shem Tov put it, God is the shadow of man.
