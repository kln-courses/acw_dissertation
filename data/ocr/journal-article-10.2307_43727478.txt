Paper Â£19.99, $32.95. This volume is intended as a source book for students, combining thematically organized quotations from primary texts and inscriptions with introductory commentary on the topics addressed. Wyatt' s underlying concern is to illustrate the ways in which ancient Near Eastern peoples employed metaphors derived from human experience and especially from cultic practice to conceptualize time and space. Spatial themes include cosmogony (myths of both creation and destruction), cosmology (the cosmic ocean, the central moun- tain), and their replication in temple architecture. Temporal themes include ancient time reckoning (calendars), foundation myths, eschatology, and periodization. One of the great strengths of this collection is its broad-ranging scope. The inclusion of Greek and Latin authors makes it a convenient resource for illustrating the Mediterra- nean inheritance of Near Eastern myths. The extension of its coverage to Second Temple Jewish and early Christian sources similarly enhances its value for the study of how those literatures reuse and refocus some long-standing continuities with both preexilic Israelite and Levantine culture generally. Copious cross-referencing assists the reader in following a particular thread through an array of overlapping themps, and up-to-date bibliography puts the student in touch with the most recent scholarship on a given topic. From a teaching perspective, the chapters follow a logical sequence. In chap. 1 , W. begins by interrogating the vocabulary of orientation (north-south-east-west) in several Near Eastern languages. Through this process, the student receives an excellent entree into the way ancients used the positioning of the human body to conceptualize not only space but also time (past and future) and their relation to it. In chap. 2, W. expands the discussion of anthropomorphism to metaphors of world-creation, whereas chaps. 3 and 4 follow in discussing the role of temple cult (chaps. 5-7) in defining cosmology by exploring the royal imagery of the Chaoskampf The remaining chapters address a variety of social uses of myth and ritual.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 563 The one downside of this sequence is that W., although he speaks of it already in chap. 2, does not provide a sustained definition of "myth" or its ramifications until chap. 8. Students (especially those who may not be familiar with the approach to myth adopted here) could have benefited from a presentation of this material early in the book. The only other caveat is that this tome is definitely geared toward the graduate level. Although written with clarity, the commentary and notes tend to be dense and laden with references that could easily intimidate undergraduates if they are not explained by the instructor. Even so, this is an excellent teaching resource, whether excerpted or used in toto. Chris Seeman, University of California, Berkeley ; CA 94720</page></plain_text>
