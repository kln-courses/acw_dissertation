The., consequences of undermining the faith of the millions are with us in such political, social and moral disorders as have startled the prophets of unbelief. The results, above all in Russia, are instruc tive and have driven serious thinkers back to a recon sideration of many ac300ted hypotheses. Hence, even if intellectual difficulties continue to exist, they are less paraded before the eyes of the multitude. Such agnos ticism as survives has largely lost its aggressive character; and something of what I may call the Locarno spirit has settled down upon the intellectual as on the political arena. But this is far from being a complete explanation. There is more than a recoil from practical consequences</page><page sequence="2">The Conflict between Religion and Science 465 in the change that has taken place. Even before the Great War signs were not wanting that men in general were growing weary of negation. The mystery of life persisted, nay, was only rendered more bewildering by the growth of knowledge. And it was increasingly realised that certain faculties, aspirations, hopes and fears of humanity were too fundamental to be eradicated ; too vast to be satisfied by the mere progress of mechanical invention or the spread of material well-being. Post egtuitem sedet atra cura. It is as true to-day of the aeronaut as it was of the Roman cavalier in the age of Horace. Man's soul persistently protests against the denial of its existence. There was bound to be a reaction against the materialistic 600ism of the nineteenth century; and that reaction has now carried us to a stage where a false spiritualism is a greater danger than the materialism which lingers, indeed, in certain quarters, but (to use Mr. Chesterton's words " as an atmosphere in which men live rather than as a thesis which they defend." The books indicated at the head of this article afford sufficient basis for an attempt to analyse the tendencies of modern thought on the greatest of all questions. To suppose that they, or many more like them, will decide the issue would be childishly sanguine. But they do show that the trend of opinion is distinctly away from the hasty and shallow s300ticism of Victorian days. Science, while enlarging enormously its area of conquest, has also become increasingly conscious of the limits of its possible achievements. It has acquired that virtue which is not uncom600ly the fruit of experience humility. Dr. Murray's work is primarily a history of science and scientific progress in the nineteenth century. It has great human interest as giving us a sidelight into the careers of the men who made that century so remark able in human progress. But its apologetical value lies in the de600stration that most of these men were 2a</page><page sequence="3">466 Studies [SEPT. too truly scientific to turn into agnostic philosophers. Of one of the few ex300tions, Professor Huxley, we are told: "He spawned hypotheses, though he never, as far as we know, originated a single discovery save the one he made as an undergraduate of nineteen " (p. 318). Dr. Murray himself explains his purpose in the preface :-- Some scientists they are not of the greatest---seem to think that a love of truth actuates a man in their ranks more than anyone else. If one reads such a tenth-rate book as J. W. Draper's History of the Conflict between Religion and Science, or even such a book as A. D. white's History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, one is conscious that both authors assume unques- tioningly that the theologian is moved by prepossessions, whereas the man of science is moved by nothing else than the desire to ascer tain the facts as they actually are. Would that it were so with all men of science . . . I have enough of faith in the candour of men of science to think that if-it is a big if it is possible to convince them that there are every whit as many prepossessions in their departments as there are in theology, we shall hear less of the warfare between science and theology. He accomplishes this by showing that there is an odium scientificum quite as passionate as the odium theologicum, and that it has done more to impede the advance of science than the opposition of the theologians. With almost 600otonous regularity all the great discoverers have had to struggle in youth against the neglect and opposition which sprang from the conservatism or jealousy of their forerunners, only in turn to manifest the same human weakness towards their own successors or supplanters.' Of personal expressions of opinion cited the most valuable is perhaps Lister's, made in 1909 : "I have no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, there is no antagonism between the religion of Jesus Christ and any fact scientifi cally known." (p. 259). Mr. Chesterton's lively and acute volume is more 'very pathetio is the story of Ignaz Philip semmeiweis of Vienna, who anticipated Lister, but met with such ridicule and opposition that he lost his reason and had to be sent to an asylum. (P. 267).</page><page sequence="4">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 467 popular in its appeal and more frankly polemical. He tilts gaily and gallantly against the weird anthropology which assumes our evolution from the ape or beyond. He makes no claim to erudition or research, but voices the plain man's vigorous protest against the pseudo science which pretends to write the history of pre-historic man; and the equally foolish liberal criticism which seeks in one way or another to diminish the dimensions and thus obscure the transcendence of Christ. The book is full of shrewd thrusts, as for example :- Touching this matter of the origin of religion, the truth is that those who are trying to explain it are trying to explain it away. Subconsciously they feel that it looks less formidable when thus lengthened out into a gradual and almost invisible process. But in fact this perspective entirely falsifies the reality of experience. They bring together two things that are totally different, the stray hints of evolutionary origins and the solid and self-evident block of humanity, and try to shift their standpoint till they see them in a single fore-shortened line. But it is an optical illusion. (p. 53). Practising a self-denying ordinance I will permit myself only one more quotation, in which Liberal criticism of the New Testament is severely but not unjustly handled The date of the Fourth Gospel, which at one time was steadily growing later and later, is now steadily growing earlier and earlier, until critics are staggered at the dawning and dreadful possibility that it might be something like what it professes to be. The last limit of an early date for the extinction of true Christianity has probably been found by the latest German professor whose authority is invoked by Dean Inge. This learned scholar says that Pentecost was the occasion of the first founding of an ecclesiastical, dogmatic and despotic Church utterly alien to the simple ideas of Jesus of Nazareth. This may be called, in a popular as well as in a learned sense, the limit. What do professors of this kind imagine that men are made of Surely anybody's com600 sense would tell him that enthusiasts , who only meet through their com600 enthusiasm for a leader whom they loved, would not instantly rush away to establish everything that he hated. No, if the "ecclesiastical and dogmatic system " is as old as Pentecost, it 2G2</page><page sequence="5">468 Studies [SEPT. is as old as Christmas. If we trace it back to such very early Christians, we must trace it back to Christ. (p. 250-251). Mr. Chesterton is . fully cognisant of the currents of thought sweeping over the English-speaking world at least, and he writes as one who feels that the vast, i pal pable cloud of doubt, which hung over that world a genera tion back, is lifting. Or, to change the metaphor, he seems to himself like a cavalry officer called upon to charge a defeated enemy, sullenly retiring and fighting here and there a rearguard action. But a weightier and more important work is un doubtedly Science, Religion and Reality, which may be described as a symposium of ten eminent scholars and writers who seek, with admirable impartiality, to examine the question: Are Science and Religion in conflict or in har600y There is one grave ex300tion to be taken to this volume. The Roman . Catholic attitude finds no representative, and: the resultant ; loss is greater than its authors are aware. But there is also an advantage. Nobody can cast the cheap reproach that fear of Roman anathemas has influenced the opinions expressed. Earl Balfour's introduction is a piece of exquisite prose, and he puts in almost perfect form, what is for many the most perturbing objection against faith It seems clear that such difficulties as there are belong more to the sphere of emotion. They are aesthetic rather than rational ; and it is only in some mood of aesthetic sentiment that we can do them justice. Let us then conceive ourselves to be gazing on a clear and quiet night upon the unveiled glory of the heavens, striving to form some adequate representation of the greatness and splendour of the innumerable suns which, crowded though they seem, lie far removed from each other and from us in the unsound' able depths of space. And then, when imagination wearies of the effort, let us consider the petty planet which for the moment is our home, and recall the tremendous events of which in the Christian story it is alleged to have men the scene. Surely in the mood which this experience naturally provokes, the contrast between the conclusions of -science and the doctrines of religion, though it</page><page sequence="6">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 469 may leave our reason unperplexed, must somewhat disturb our feelings. An American writer has described this sense of human insignificance amid the vastness of the universe as the "cosmic chill" Earl Balfour answers it by the latest teaching of science as to the nature of celestial bodies : The glory of the stars is the joint product of our mental con stitution, our nervous system, our eyes and certain electro-magnetic happenings whose effects are conveyed to us from the remotest parts of space through the ether ' by which we are surrounded. The orbs of heaven, apart from our per300tion of them, consist of incre dibly minute electric charges thinly scattered through the vast and vacant areas, which, in the language of sense per300tion, we describe as stars . . . . It is to us who dwell on earth that these glories owe their being. If we are nothing, they are nothing. They are born of our terrestial sensibilities. Perhaps a simpler answer is that mind and matter are incommensurable quantities, and that the simplest spiritual being transcends in dignity and importance a thousand suns and solar systems. The spectacular immensity of the universe creates a difficulty for the imagination, but not for the intellect. Men in general are too much under the domination of the imagination. But the philosopher should control the operation of this important but de300tive faculty. It is the function of the intelligence, Kant tells us, to set limits to the imagi nation's play of fancy (Schwa*armerei). It is difficult to imagine so vast a world pivoting on so poor a thing as man appears to be. Yet if man is the only creature of intellect and will within the confines of the cosmos -a question we cannot settle with certainty the cosmos exists that he, seeing it, may glorify God. For the glory of God is the end of creation; and only reasonable beings can give formal glory to God. All this may seem scholas tic or mediaeval to modern thought. But let the latter supply an ac300table substitute before it asks us to abandon the only explanation which gives a meaning to any single thing within our ken.</page><page sequence="7">470 Studies [SEPT. Now that we are spiritual beings, that there is some thing in us which cannot be explained in terms of matter, whatever be the ultimate analysis which science offers of matter, is generally admitted to-day. As Earl Balfour well says, "no man really supposes personally Y Y p . is nothing more than a changing group of electrical charges, so distributed that their relative motions enable or compel them in their collective capacity to will, to hope, to love, to think, perhaps to discuss themselves as a physical unity." And spiritual reality once admitted, the laws governing it are immediately and obviously removed from the empire or inquisition of the physical sciences. Ifence the possibility of conflict is excluded, and such opposition as appears to exist necessarily springs from exaggerated statements or claims on one side or the other. The fact that misunderstandings between science and religion have at times arisen in the past is too obvious to be denied. But the whole drift of this volume is to show that there have been misunderstandings and no more. The blame for them has lain now with the theologian now with the scientist; but the number and the extent of them have also been exaggerated. Dr. Charles Singer in a paper entitled Historical Relations seeks to specify the times and circumstances in which opposition, real or apparent, arose between the two great departments of human knowledge. He does not find such opposition a600g primitive men, to whom indeed he attributes too little of either science or religion. Neither does he discover it in the early civilisations of Egypt or the Mesopotamian peoples, nor yet a600g the Jews. For him the true idea of science, as we under stand it now, arose a600g the Greeks; and it was first clearly differentiated from religion by the Coan physician Hippocrates the Great. The philosophers trenched upon both domains, and might (he thinks have come into conflict with religious teaching if there had been any serious religious system; but there was not. Curiously</page><page sequence="8">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 471 enough he sees in Wisdom ch. V. a Jewish repudiation of Greek thought, and in the Apocalyptic literature of the Rabbis, as well as the early Christian insistence upon the Day of the Lord, he detects a revolt against the study of phenomena, which is science. Galen of Pergamum (150-200 A.D. took up intermediate ground between Stoicism and Christianity, and with his death "science too fell dead and was not reborn for a thousand years." The early Christian Church was in opposition to the philosophical basis of pagan thought, and sofarforth in opposition to the deterministic science embedded in it. "But the conflict was simply with a philosophical tradition which contained dead, non-progressive, and misunder stood scientific elements." In the Middle Ages Christi anity and Aristotelianism worked har600iously, though Dr. Singer thin the har600y was conditioned to a large extent by mediaeval ignorance of the real teaching of Aristotle. Such conflict as arose "was not of faith versus observation, but of opinion versus opinion," Indeed the Ptolemaic system, coupled with the general philosophic outlook of the time, rendered conflict impossible. There were no discoveries of natural laws, no proclamation of scientific theories based upon detailed observation, experi ment, and research to clash with received beliefs. The birth of modern science falls between 1,500 and 1,700 A.D. Here we find the beginning of misunderstandings. Even then " it was the cosmical speculations of astronomers and physicists, not the investigations of biologists, that attracted unwelcome ecclesiastical attention." Dr. Singer tells the story with a laudable effort at impar tiality. Thus he writes: "Giordano Bruno (1548-1600). who was no practical scientist, had eagerly incorporated into his often fantastic philosophy the ill-worked-out conclusions of Copernicus. Despite the allegorical pre sentation of his thoughts, his works leave us in no doubt of the vehemence of his attack upon established religion." In his account of the famous Galileo controversy he</page><page sequence="9">472 Series [SEPT. exaggerates tes the part played by the Jesuits in opposition to the great scientist, who had friends as well as adver-o series in the Order. Bellarmine was distinctly friendly, though he seems to have thought the doctrines dangerous and wrong. It was a Dominican who: first. brought Galileo's teaching under the notice : of the Inquisition, and the theological opposition was too general . to be laid at the door of any particular group. The new ideas were startling, and it is to be noted that Galileo brought very inadequate scientific proofs, while his efforts to wrest the Scriptures to his views were not felicitous. But Dr. Singer, at least, spares us all the nonsense about torture and persecution which has been current ever since in non-Catholic circles. Of epler, who carried on the work of Galileo, he writes: " Kepler, despite the mystical and doubtless heretical tendencies of many of his religious views, retained a perfectly simple religious faith, and regarded scientific discovery as a process of the revelation of the greatness of the Creator." Again neither Des nor . Newton were at loggerheads with religion. The errors of the former both in philosophy and science were soon manifest enough. But they were debated without any particular odium theologicum, and were refuted by scientists and philosophers more than by theologians. In conclusion Dr. Singer thinks that the real achievement of science which may be supposed to constitute a difficulty for religion is the discovery of the reign of law. Even Darwinism has introduced no new factor. "After Darwin it was neither easier nor harder to explain how man could escape from the tyranny of natural law. Darwin doubtless brought the problem home to the ordinary man; he did not create it for the thinker." Yet we may ask ourselves: Does it exist for the thinker at all The Reign of Law may be taken to mean the existence of . an ordered universe governed by a Supreme Lawgiver, and then no difficulty is created for any thinker</page><page sequence="10">1926 The Con, flirt between &amp;ligion and Science 47s who has an elementary grasp of logic; or it may mean, as on the lips of many it apparently does mean, the existence of an uncaused, unexplained universe subject to laws emanating from no lawgiver, governed by no purpose and moving to no end. Such a con300tion certainly eonfiicts with religion; but does it not also conflict with the primary laws of thought. And if any scientist asserts such a metaphysical system, is he not quitting his last very foolishly and erring very palpably Dr. Singer is able to assure us that the majority of men of science " have ac300ted their religion as they found it ... . A proportion of scientific men, incensed by the mere discrepancy between the Biblical and the scientific record, have abandoned more or less completely their relation to religion." He himself seems to suppose 'there are only two ways out--a separation of internal from external experience and a flight to a haven of peace down the mystic way, or a combination of determinism and pantheism such as has appealed to many scientists since Spinoza. But is there not a tertium quid, namely, a synthesis of internal and external experience, leading through reason to a higher unity and a First Source of spirit and matter as well as of laws governing both realms Nothing is more astonishing than the assumption that religion needs a lawlessness in the universe either for its existence or for its de600stration. On the contrary one of the metaphysical arguments for the existence of God is based precisely on the awe-inspiring manifestation of wisdom in the ordering of the cosmos. The Book of Wisdom and St. Paul. argued from it; and the pre Copernican scholastics argued . from it with no less fervour than the post-Copernicans. Every increment to our know ledge of that order reinforces this impressive argument. Neither does free-will clash with the reign of law. It certainly clashes with a purely mechanical, deterministic interpretation of life. But does this not also clash with one of the evident data of consciousness-our own free</page><page sequence="11">474 Studies [SEI!r. dam: lessor Needham in his own able contribution .concludes : I -have hoped also to show that although mechanism in biology is perfectly justified, and indeed essential, it cannot be applied to psychology.... The earlier mechanistic biology,, before the era of experimental science, was indeed somawbat incompatible With religion, because it did not know its own limitations, nor did these become apparent until quite recent times. But now that the assumptions on which the triumph of mechanistic biology in the last century is based have been well examined, it is seen that for its own sphere it is a real triumph, but, at the same time, its jurisdiction over other fields cannot be admitted. The theologian is not called upon to take sides in the purely biological discussion. But if mechanism is excluded from psychology, he has all he needs for main taining the freedom of the soul. And here it is interesting to observe a certain ironical revanche de Dieu, which has its pathetic as well as its instructive : aspects. The Reminiscences of a Maynooth Professor appeared simultaneously with the volume under consideration. In this retrospect of a troubled career, Dr. McDoonald retells the story of his work On Motion, with an unshaken assurance that the thesis condemned by Church authority was and is true, was and is alone compatible with science. Let us see. Dr. McDonald assumes as a conclusion of science that all energy is kinetic. From this he goes on to argue that all causation in secondary causes is motion received from the First Cause and passed on. He then extends this to spiritual activities, and bases on it a novel theory of the Divine Coneursus, natural and supernatural. We need not here enter into this highly metaphysical question. It will be enough to examine the starting point of the discussion. Is all energy kinetic It is true that many scientists thought so half a century ago. But now Professor Aliotta of the University of Naples, in a paper entitled Science and Religion in the Ninmke h Century, informs us that " C'arnot's principle shows the impossi</page><page sequence="12">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 475 bility of reducing all the varied forms of energy to kinetic alone." Hence, even in the domain of physical forces, the hypothesis that led a Professor of theology to views on spiritual agencies which seem to jeopardise the freedom of the will has been disproven by experiments in thermo dynamics I This is only one example of what has often occurred, namely, the appearance of conflict arising from the too hasty ac300tation of scientific hypotheses and the extension of them to fields where, whether true or false, they do not apply. If Dr. McDonald had brought to the consideration of scientific teaching as critical a -spirit as he manifested in his study of theology, he might have been spared much spiritual anguish. Professor Aliotta adds: "The law of the conservation of quantity has no significance in the spiritual life, but is rather a perennial creation of new qualities." And again: "Some of the foregoing observations have shown us that there was a profound contradiction in the very bosom of the theory of evolution, which was the pet idea of Positivism." Professor Needham in another place writes : " The triumph of mechanistic biology has indeed been a real one, for it has succeeded in abolishing the vital force in living things which so unnecessarily complicated the whole question. We are back again with the con300t of the undivided anima, and the .ground is perfectly clear for philosophical and psychological discussion as to the psychophysical problem." This looks very like a confir mation of that Canon of the Council of Vienne which Dr. McDonald held . would need revision, namely that " the rational or intellectual soul is essentially and per se the form of the body." Needless to say I pass no judg ment on the biological problem. Much in the Professor's paper supposes a specialised knowledge which I am far from possessing. But I may again point out the ironical contrast between Dr. McDonald's abandonment of an infallible statement and the most recent confirmation of that statement by biologists, not theologians.</page><page sequence="13">476 Studies [SEPT. Professor Eddington in his contribution, The Domain of Physical Science, sums up the present situation thus We have attempted in this essay to show the direction which, it appears to us, the tendency of modern scientific thought is taking. It differs markedly from the views of thirty years ago . . . . Let the scientist stick to his pointer-readings, is a good rule; and if, like many before us who have broken it, we have lost our way in the outer fog, we may perhaps plead that it was necessary to show that -students of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have at least different ways of losing themselves, and the unqualified materialism of the last century is not to-day the most inviting bypath. Our thesis has been that the recent tendencies of scientific thought lead to the belief that mind is a greater instrument than was formerly recognised in prescribing the nature and laws of the external world as studied in physical science ; that in exploring his own territory the physicist comes up against the influence of that wider reality which he cannot altogether shut out . . . . We have spelt mind with a small" m," for our values are human values ; yet we trust there is in us something that has value for the eternal. Perhaps the activity of the world is not only in these little sparks from the divine mind which flicker for a few years and are gone, but in the Mind, the Logos. " The same was in the beginning with God . . . . And without Him was not anything made that was made." It will not be expected that science should indicate how this colourless pantheism is to be made into a vital religion. Science does not indicate whether the world spirit is good or evil, but it does perhaps justify us in applying the adjective " creative." It is for other considerations to examine the daring hypothesis that the Spirit in whom we have our being-our actuality is approach able to us ; that He is to us the beneficent Father, without which it seems to me, the question of the theoretical existence of a God has little significance. This is not a very precise or triumphant credo; but it is all the more typical of the work we are examining on that account. All the writers are clear about the dualism of mind and matter. All admit that science keeping to its own province cannot pronounce on origins or ultimate causes. All deny that the sciences invalidate the claims of religion. All agree that the laboratory cannot settle everything. They are conscious that physics, however</page><page sequence="14">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 477 developed, do not render metaphysics superfluous. . Thus far their papers have apologetical value. But it must be admitted that their own philosophical and religious ideas are neither clear nor accurate. Even Professor Oman, in a conscientious effort to define religion, arrives at a definition which is inadequate rather than erroneous. But he registers one very useful protest Religion, more than any other subject, claims interest ap its due, and more definitely affirms that it cannot. be found or understood without something like enthusiasm for it .... But this view is far from receiving universal ac300tance. While students of other subjects are approved for regarding their facts as certain and impor tant, interest in religion is frequently forthwith and without further discrimination identified with bias. Thus, not only a complete lack of interest, but a positive distaste for the whole business has at times beenput forward as a necessary qualification for an uncor rupted inquiry. Lack of interest in a subject which deserves interest is itself bias, and is sure to overlook or distort the facts to be considered. Dean Inge in his Conclusion, while agreeing with the tenor of what the scientists had said, adds the warning: " Those Churchmen who airily declare that there is no longer any conflict between Christianity and science are very thoughtless or are .wilfully shutting their eyes. There is a very serious conflict, and the challenge was presented not in the age of Darwin, but in the age of Copernicus and Galileo." His difficulty is, however, very different from the one mentioned by Earl Balfour. He thinks that the creeds of the Church suppose geo centrism so essentially that they are rendered meaningless by the Copernican astronomy. Of all the difficulties touched on in the volume this seems the strangest. The dullest mediaeval theologian or philosopher would have smiled at the idea that the dogmas of the Resurrection and Ascension, of Hell and. Heaven could be essentially dependent on our ideas of space and time. No doubt there was, is, and must be a certain anthropomorphism in our formulation of divine truths. Yet surely an</page><page sequence="15">478 Studie8 [SEPT, A quiet or a Scotus saw that too clearly to be deceived by the form of the expression. That the dogmas of the faith were irrevocably bound up with "a geographical heaven" such as is found in the Ptolemaic system would have seemed to them just puerile. It is a relief to pass from this work, ire and reverent though it be, to the two volumes in which Abbe Moreux makes a comprehensive survey of the whole question. It is a relief for the reason that both sides of the case are so clearly stated. He begins by assuring us that "if we follow him we shall discover that the . confines of religion and science are much more restricted than is generally thought." The dogmas of faith which come under consideration are: "An eternal God, Creator of the world, which He has drawn from nothingness and governs by laws freely chosen by Himself, which do not exclude miracle or prayer. God, finally, creating man in His Image, that is, giving him a spiritual soul endowed with intelligence , and freewill." Does science contradict any one of these The learned Abe (and the adjective is here no epitheton ins gives a very decisive negative. He shows, first, that science, unlike dogma, is perpetually changing, advancing from hypothesis, to hypothesis. Of these some are later de600strably falsified; the best suffer very profound modifications. He does not deny to scientists the right to form hypotheses, without which there would be no advance at all, nor even the right to call in the aid of philosophy and metaphysics. Only he pleads that they shall first acquire some grasp of philosophy, especially of the fundamental branch called Logic, that is the laws of right reason, and of the basic truths of metaphysics. But the agnostic scientists, while pretending to deride philosophy and metaphysics, are perpetually making statements that are not the offspring of scientific investigation, but the fruits of mental bias. Littre declared: " The essential postulate of materialism is the eternity of matter, namely, that it has had no origin</page><page sequence="16">1926 The Conflict between Religion and Science 479 and shall have no end." This and the infinity of space are, according to Abbe Moreux, the fundamental dogmas of positivism. Both are, he contends, de600strably false. The world we behold, though unimaginably vast, cannot be infinite and cannot be eternal. Science affords no basis for eternal evolution. On the contrary the phenomenon of entropy or transformation of energy shows that the cosmos, if existing from eternity, would be like a clock run down. And to suppose a winding up again without some extracosmic power would be, first, a gra tuitous supposition and, secondly, an absurd one. The value of these volumes, however, lies rather in the proofs they give how the recent discoveries of science have made the older materialistic hypotheses appear rather ludicrous. On the whole, then, we may conclude that science to-day creates less difficulties for faith than ever. It has altered none of the facts upon which metaphysics based its proofs of God's existence, attributes and activi ties. It has in no wise disproved a causa finalis or weakened the force of the teleological argument. It has utterly failed to explain mind as a function of matter. It has not and cannot disprove the possibility of miracle. It leaves the problem of belief where it was from the beginning, and where it shall be to the end.' P. I. CANNON.
