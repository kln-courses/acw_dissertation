These accounts may be seen as conforming unconsciously to accepted patterns of dream reporting in the ancient world. These dreams fall into the categories of auditory message dreams, visual symbolic dreams, and human dream-images. For Josephus the dream was important since he viewed himself as a dream interpreter. Sommaire Flavius Josephe témoigne de trente deux récits de rêves dans ses écrits. Ces récits semblent se conformer inconsciemment aux schémas de rêves de l'antiquité. Ils se classent en : rêves à message auditif, rêves visuels symboliques et images humaines rêvées. Pour Josephe, les rêves étaient importants en ce qu'il se percevait comme un interprète des rêves. INTRODUCTION1 By his own testimony Flavius Josephus was an accomplished interpreter of dreams ( War III, 352). 1 With this skill he not only foresaw the ultimate triumph of Rome over the Jews (War III, 351- 354), but even was encouraged to surrender at Jotapata and thereby 1 I would like to thank Loyola University, New Orleans, for the research grant which made this study possible. 2 All citations of Josephus' work are taken from the editions of H.

Perhaps the truth lies in a subtle combination of both observations. Dream interpretation was probably a common phenomenon among the popular beliefs of first century Palestinians.6 Scholars have proposed that Josephus might have learned the techniques either from the Essenes, whose movement attracted his attention early in life, or the Sadducean priests, the party to which Josephus belonged by birth and pedigree. Josephus refers to the teachings and practices of the Essenes in several places, and Simon the Essene reputedly interpreted a dream of Archelaus which no one else could unravel (War II, 111-114; Aril XVII, 345-346).7 This has led writers to presume an Essenic origin for Josephus' skill or at least his literary interest in dreams.8 But Josephus' own reference to his priestly 3 Tessa Rajak, Josephus: The Historian and His Society (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1984), pp. 169-170; and Morton Smith, "The Occult in Josephus," Josephus, Judaism, and Christianity , eds.

Hence, we accept our inability to answer whether Josephus possessed the ability of dream interpretation or claimed it for the convenience of self-preservation and whether his skill or interest in dream interpretation was learned from Essenes or priests. Nevertheless, dreams play a role in the literature authored by Josephus. In the autobiographical material he claimed the course of his life to have been affected by several dreams. In the historical narratives he recorded the majority of dreams found in the biblical text and added to them the dream experiences of numerous other individuals (Amran, Ehud, Nathan, Jaddus, Theopompos, Hyrcanus, Herod, Matthias, Archelaus, Glaphyra, Monobazus) and in his apologetic work, Against Apion , he alludes to dreams of Stratonice and Amenophis. Altogether there are at least thirty two full dream reports or references to dream experiences in the writings of Josephus (three reports in the War of the Jews are duplications of reports in the Antiquities of the Jews). Despite Josephus' self-involvement in dream interpretation and the presence of thirty two dream accounts in his writings little attention has been paid to the phenomenon of dreams in Josephus.11 No special consideration has been given to the form and content of these dream reports. Scholars have observed that Josephus seems to have certain conscious agenda in his portrayal of dreams. He appears desirous of impressing his audience with the notion that dreams are messages 9 Lindner, Geschichtsauffassung , pp. 74-75; Rajak, Josephus , p. 19, considered it to be a skill of pagan priests emulated by Jewish priests; and Beall, Essenes , p. 110. Cf. Jacob Neusner, A Life of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai Ca. 1-80 C.E. (Leiden: Brill, 1962), pp. 110-111, who observed that such a skill would be unacceptable in pharisaical circles, hence by deduction an origin in priestly circles should be assumed. 10 J.

In the dream reports of pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar (two accounts), and Archelaus (two accounts) pagan divinators fail while the traditional Jewish prophet succeeds in unraveling the mysterious message of the dream. Herein we perceive the old Jewish critique of pagan religion: only prophets of the one true God can authentically reveal the divine will, for God has freely disclosed it to them, they have not divined the secrets of the cosmos by human skill. Beyond these observations, worthwhile though they may be, little assessment has been done of the actual dream reports. Perhaps the problem lies in the amorphous nature of the reports. Josephus did not consciously use a clear literary format in recording dreams, as did a contemporary source like the Gospel of Matthew, in which the Infancy Narratives of Matthew 1-2 contained five quite stereotypic dream reports utilizing the language of patriarchal message dreams in Genesis.14 This renders a systematic analysis of Josephus' dreams difficult, but not impossible. Though Josephus did not consciously use literary formula in his dream reports, he did impart formulaic expressions unconsciously from the various accepted modes of dream reporting current in the ancient world. One may observe among Josephus' dream reports three types of dreams: 1) auditory message dreams, most common in the biblical text, 2) visual symbolic dreams, best typified by the dreams of Joseph in Genesis and Daniel, and 3) visual image dreams (eïScoXov), a phenomenon common among greek dream reports. This essay will seek to analyze the dreams of Josephus to indicate that Josephus used the acceptable modes of reporting dreams in the hebraic and greek cultures of his age, and that his primary dependence appears to have been upon models taken from the biblical text. 12 Thomas Franxman, Genesis and "Jewish Antiquities " of Flavius Josephus , Biblica et Orientalia, vol. 35 (Rome: Biblical Institute, 1979), pp. 217, 244. 13 Smith, "Occult," p. 246. 14 In a forthcoming article entitled "Dream Genre in the Matthean Infancy Narratives," by the author.</page><page sequence="5">362 ROBERT GNUSE DREAM REPORT GENRES The evaluation of dreams in the ancient world prior to the time of Josephus has been undertaken in a number of very fine scholarly studies. A brief review of this material will enable us to more clearly focus upon the form and purpose that might underlie the dream reports of Josephus. Ancient near eastern dreams have been considered by a number of author,15 but the most thorough study of type and structure of dream reports has been provided to us by A. Leo Oppenheim.16 He classified dreams into three types: 1) auditory message dreams, clearly understood vocal messages from deities without significant visual imagery, 2) symbolic message dreams, visual images which usually required a professional dream interpreter's skill at decoding, and 3) psychological status dreams, fragmentary visual images usually requiring interpretation by a dream book to decode for the sake of removing the impurity brought upon the dreamer. The first two categories were the experiences of priests, kings, and significant people recorded for social and political reasons, while the last category reflected the dreams of common people not worthy of recording and otherwise unavailable to us were it not for the omina lists in the dream books used by professional interpreters. The first two categories were divine theophanies, and the stereotyped reports in the royal annals resemble actual dream experiences very little, while the last category contained true dream-like images. Oppenheim delineated the structure of the dream report as follows: 16 Julian Oberman, How Daniel was blessed with a Son: An Incubation Scene in Ugarit, AOS offprint series 20, Supp. to JAOS 66,2 (1946): 1-30; Serge Sauneron, ed., Les songes et leur interprétation , Sources orientales 2 (Paris: Seuil 1959), pp. 19-124; A.

A form-critical and linguistic connection between these dreams, particularly the auditory message dreams, and dream reports in the Hebrew Bible may be established. Biblical dreams have been evaluated in a number of fine studies.17 In previous work this author sought to demonstrate in particular the connection of ancient near 17 Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich, Der Traum im Alten Testament , BZAW, vol. 73 (Berlin: Gruyter, 1953), pp. 1-170, has provided the most thorough evaluation of dream reports and references to dreams in the Hebrew Bible; Wolfgang Richter, "Traum und Traumdeutung im Alten Testament," BZ 1 (1963): 202-220, undertook a thorough form-critical analysis of the Joseph dreams which demonstrated the significant difference between auditory and visual-symbolic dreams; Andreas Resch, Der Traum im Heilsplan Gottes: Deutung und Bedeutung des Traums im Alten Testament (Freiburg: Herder, 1964), pp. 1-137, tried to understand the biblical dreams with psychological categories, but failed to understand the critical dynamics in the creation of a literary text (cf. critical response by Robert Gnuse, The Dream Theophany of Samuel: Its Structure in Belation to Ancient Near Eastern Dreams and Its Theological Significance (Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1984), pp. 57-59); Murray Lichten- stein, "Dream Theophany and the E document," JANES 1/2 (1969): 45-54, who vainly tried to refute the existence of separate pentateuchal traditions by an analysis of dreams in Genesis over against the anthropomorphic form of divine revelation (cf. critical response by Gnuse, Dream , pp. 73-74) ; Albert de Pury, Promesse divine et légende cultuelle dans le cycle de Jacob: Genèse 28 et les traditions patriarcales , 2 vols., Études Bibliques (Paris: Gabalda, 1975), 1:212-240, 312-330, 368-387, who analyzed dreams by Abraham in Genesis 15 and Jacob in Genesis 28; Walter Beyerlin, We Are Like Dreamers: Studies in Psalm 126 , trans.

The pattern found in these dreams by the author is:19 i. Theophany ii. Recipient in. Dream Reference iv. Time of Dream v. Auditory Message Dream Address Formula vi. Message A. Introductory Formula (particle hinnēh) B. Divine Self-Identification C. Message Proper: Assurance, Promise, Warnings, or Directions to Recipient D. Dialogue (optional) vii. Fulfillment (usually occurs in subsequent narrative) The theophany is expressed by the phrase, "God/angel of God/Lord" "came/stood/spoke/appeared." The recipient is the human dreamer, usually listed by name as the indirect object (Ie). The dream reference is almost always to a "dream" (halôm), only once to "vision" (mar'oih) in Genesis 46:2. Night is usually listed as the time of the dream (Genesis 20:3, 31:24, 46:2, Numbers 22:20, I Kings 3:5). The auditory address formula (wayyo'mer) clearly indicates that God spoke - implying this is an auditory message dream, not a visual apparition (only in Genesis 28:13, 31:10 is incidental visionary imagery implied). The message begins either with the particle "behold" ( hinnēh ) in Genesis 20:3 or a vocative in Genesis 31:11, 46:2. God identifies himself in Genesis 28:13, 31:13, 46:3. Assurance of divine presence and promise are given in Genesis 28:13-15, 46:2-3, I Kings 3:5-15; directions are provided in Genesis 31:12, 46:2-3, Numbers 22:20; and orders are issued in Genesis 20:3, 31:24. Dialogue occurs in Genesis 20:4-5, 31:11, 46:2, Numbers 22:10-11, I Kings 3:5- 18 Gnuse, "I Samuel 3," pp. 379-390, and Dream , 11-177. 19 Idem., Dream , 75-79.</page><page sequence="8">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 365 15. Formal termination is provided in Genesis 20:8, 28:16, and I Kings 3:15 with the expression that the recipient "awoke"; I Kings 3:15 adds the formula, "it was a dream." Though the pattern is not perfectly uniform in every dream report, the language is stereotyped enough to warrant calling these texts part of a common form-critical genre. Visual-symbolic message dreams are likewise evident in the Hebrew Bible, the examples include the dreams of the Midianite soldier (Judges 7:13-15) two dreams of Joseph (Genesis 37:5-9), the dreams of the butler and the baker (Genesis 40:8-23), two dreams of pharaoh (Genesis 41:1-32), and two dreams of Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2:1-45, 3:31-4:34). In most instances symbolic dreams come in pairs, for their vague symbolic nature makes interpretation difficult, and paired dreams often enable the professional interpreter to more readily decode the message.20 Visual-symbolic dreams generally lack the tight dream report format of auditory message dreams, though as Oppenheim's study of ancient near eastern dreams indicated, the general pattern remains much the same for both types of dream. However, the special pattern of visual-symbolic dreams in the Hebrew Bible has received a fine form-critical assessment by Wolfgang Richter. His pattern is:21 i. Announcement of the Dream ii. Introductory Dream Formula in. Dream Corpus A. Image B. Result iv. Interpretation of the Dream A. Formula of Interpretation B. Interpretation 1. Identification 2. Meaning v. Dream Fulfillment (ensuing narrative) The dreams of the Midianite, Joseph, the butler, the baker, pharaoh, and Nebuchadnezzar contain these elements rather consistently. The dream is announced by an expression like: "X dreamed a dream" (Genesis 37:5, 37:9, 41:1, 41:5, Daniel 2:1), "I dreamed a dream" 20 Alfred Wikenhauser, "Doppelträume," Bib 29 (1948): 100-111. 21 Richter, "Traum," pp. 202-220; and Gnuse, Dream , pp. 80-81, 92-101.</page><page sequence="9">366 ROBERT GNUSE (Judges 7:13, Genesis 37:6, 37:9, Daniel 2:3, 4:5), or "in my dream" (Genesis 40:9, 40:16). The introductory dream formula is "behold" ( hinnēh ) (Judges 7:13, Genesis 37:7, 37:9, 40:9, 40:16, 41:1, 41:5, Daniel 2:31). A dream-image is given (Midianite's barley cake, Joseph's sheaves and stars, butler's vine and branches, baker's basket of baked goods, pharaoh's corn and cows, and Nebuchadnezzar's statue and tree) and the action it undertakes is described. A formula of interpretation is given, such as: "this is nothing else but" (Judges 7:14), "this is the interpretation" (Genesis 40:12, 40:18), "the dream of pharaoh is one" (Genesis 41:25, 26), and "we will tell the interpretation" (Daniel 2:36). An identification of the key image is made in one or two verses, and the activity or interpretative meaning of the image is explained in slightly longer fashion (only in Daniel 2:36-45 is the interpretative identification not separated from the interpretative meaning). Though visual-symbolic dreams tend to be longer and more complex than auditory message dreams, form- critical analysis has discerned a clear pattern in the dream reports. Dream reports also abound in classical and hellenistic sources. Over the past several generations excellent studies have been generated by classicists concerning the nature and development of greek dreams and their recording.22 Graeco-Roman sources reflect a complex 22 A.

Several different types of dream report may be observed: 1) the etStoXou or dream-image, which speaks, 2) the voice or noise from the heavens which occurs at a symbolically pregnant moment, 3) symbolic visions, similar to ancient near eastern and biblical types, 4) dream reports about a healing deity, such as Asclepius, who manifests himself or some apparition in the process of healing an incubant in a shrine, and 5) true dream-like images, often reported in vague or incoherent fashion (the psychologi- cal status dreams identified by Oppenheim in the ancient Near East). The eiScaXou has special interest for this study, since some of the Josephus dreams appear to have been influenced by this dream type. The eïScoXou is a dream image of a deity, deceased, or living person who appears 4 'standing" above or by the dreamer to deliver an oral message containing either warnings, predictions, or directions for the dreamer.23 The dream types seems to have replaced the frequent auditory message dream of the ancient near eastern materials in Greece. In this regard we may anticipate that some of the auditory message dream reports in Josephus may begin to appear as greek eï8o)Xoo dream reports. Classic examples may be found in Homer and greek tragedy: 1) Nestor appears to Agamemnon ( Iliad 2:lff.), 2) a human form appears to Dolon ( Iliad 10:496-497), 3) Patroclus appears to Achilles ( Iliad 23:62-107), 4) Iphthime appears to Penelope (Odyssey 4:787-841), 5) Athene appears to Nausicaa (Odyssey 6:13-51), Clytaemestra appears to the Furies in the play Eumenides by Aeschylus, and 7) Polydorus addresses the audience from the stage in the play Hecuba by Euripides.24 Despite the wide diversity of the different dreams which convey messages (auditory or symbolic) John Hanson has undertaken to delineate a dream format for the later greek and hellenistic dream reports. His format is as follows:25 Haase (Berlin: Gruyter, 1980), pp. 1395-1427, evaluated dreams in the New Testament and the early church as well as late hellenistic period; and R. G. A. van Lieshout, Greeks on Dreams (Utrecht: HES , 1980), pp. 1-125, provided a very thorough analysis of dreams, dream interpretation, and theory of origin of dreams among the Greeks. 23 Van Lieshout, Greeks, pp. 15-18. 24 Messer, Dream , pp. 2-20, 24-30, 74-77, 83-90. 26 Hanson, "Dreams," pp. 1405-1414 especially, but also "Dream/Vision Report," pp. 1-2 et passim.</page><page sequence="11">368 ROBERT GNUSE i.

These three categories will operate quite well in assessing the dreams of Josephus. The auditory and visual-symbolic dreams of greek sources correspond to similar types in the ancient Near East and the Hebrew Bible; the dream-image format may have evolved out of auditory message dreams in the ancient Near East where the appearance of the deity was occasionally mentioned in some vague fashion. Likewise, in biblical texts there are allusions to incidental visual phenomena in otherwise clear auditory messages (especially in dreams associated with the Jacob cycle in Genesis). These biblical texts share ancient near eastern traits in this regard and fall short of the more developed</page><page sequence="12">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 369 dream-image which speaks in clear fashion. On the whole, greek dreams are far more complex than ancient near eastern and biblical dreams, especially in terms of portraying mental processes and attitudes of the dream. The Semitic dream reports contain terse language and simple representation of the external circumstances of the theophany. Finally, the New Testament also contains some dream reports worthy of mention. In the Infancy Narratives of Matthew 1-2 five dream reports (1:20-25, 2:12, 2:13-15, 2:19-21, 2:22) occur in very terse, stereotypic language, which correspond closely to the auditory message dreams of the patriarchal narratives.26 A number of visions articulated with a loose form-critical structure are located in Acts (Paul had a vision, opoqxa, of a man of Macedón in 16:9, Cornelius saw the angel of the Lord in 10:1-8, Peter heard a voice with a vision in 10:9-20, Paul received encouragement from the angel of the Lord in 18:9, 23:11, and 27:23, and perhaps the experiences of Paul and Ananias in 9:3-17 might constitute a dream). These have been assessed by Hanson in a very thorough study.27 With the insights provided by the consideration of these various dream types found throughout the ancient sources the scholar can approach the dream reports in Josephus and begin to make sensitive observations. Although Josephus did not appear to use any particular format consciously, it does seem that he used the language and format of patterns existent in his cultural milieu. COMMENTARY ON THE DREAM REPORTS Thirty two dream reports or references are found in the various writings of Josephus: four in War of the Jews , twenty five in Antiquities of the Jews , one in Life , and two in Against Apion.

The dreams will be considered in the writings according to the order in which Josephus generated the works. Herod: War I, 328 A brief reference to a dream is provided in the greek text of Herod's experience.28 Herod had dreams (övap) warning him of his brother's death. He jumped from his bed in terror only to hear the news confirming his dreams. The use of the word "to warn" (7rpoay)fxaivouaiv) may imply that these dreams were predictive. The reference to more than one dream may imply the dreams were visual and symbolic rather than auditory, since ambiguous symbolic dreams often come in pairs. Symbolic dreams likewise are usually predictive, while auditory dreams are clear and directive. But this is a hypothetical assessment on a brief text. The reference to jumping out of bed may be considered some form of formal termination or response to the dream. Archelaus: War II, 112-113 The dream of Archelaus is clearly a visual-symbolic dream comparable in form and content to the Joseph dreams in Genesis.29 Before Archelaus was banished he had a dream in which "nine ears of corn were eaten by oxen." We are reminded of pharaoh's dream wherein seven cows and seven ears of corn are consumed respectively by the thin versions of their own kind (Genesis 41). Here more logically corn is eaten by the animals. Perhaps there is more than just coincidence with the use of these symbols, Josephus may have shaped this text under the influence of the Joseph narratives. The experience is called an övap toióvSe, and he observed it (iSelv). The actual vision is introduced with the formula, eSoÇev ópãv, and as Hanson's outline of greek dreams indicated, this verb (8oxéa&gt;) is common in introductory dream formulas. We shall note its frequency with symbolic dream reports in Josephus. As both the pharaoh in Genesis and Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, Archelaus called for skilled interpreters of dreams ([aocvtek; xai twv ^aXSaicov), who failed, then Simon the Essene successfully interpreted the dream. Ears of corn 28 However, the Slavonic text does provide a dream account, John Thackeray, Josephus : The Man and the Hislotian (New York: KTAV, 1967; reprint, Jewish Institute of Religion, 1929), p. 150. For our purposes we shall consider only the greek text. 29 Beall, Essenes , p. 109.</page><page sequence="14">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 371 denoted years and oxen indicated a change; thus Archelaus' rule was perceived to be at an end. Simon was outside the established court order, just as Joseph and Daniel, who also succeeded when the professionals failed and proclaimed a word of judgment. Josephus' account may have influence from both novellas of Joseph (Genesis 41) and Daniel (Daniel 2, 4). 30 Interpretative method especially reminds us of Joseph's technique: devouring of substances forebodes evil, and their number allegorically equals years.31 The dream report is clearly predictive and visual-symbolic; it shares much with biblical tradi- tions. Glaphyra: War II, 114-116 The dream of Archelaus' wife, Glaphyra, follows directly in the text. It is altogether different than the preceding account, for visual and auditory phenomena are mingled. The central feature is the image of a dead person (e£8&lt;oXov), so common in Homer and greek tragedy,32 and this text appears as a classic example of that type of dream report. The deceased Alexander, first husband of Glaphyra and brother of Archelaus, condemned her for the present marriage to his brother and predicted her death. She obliged and died two days later. Thus while Archelaus' dream appears influenced by biblical accounts, this dream reflects greek influence. Her experience was called an ovap and the dream image was imagined (êSoÇev) by her. The dream figure was ''standing" (è7turrávTa), as is the case with dream-images, and he spoke in clear auditory fashion. Though his message contained clear judgment, reminiscient of biblical spokespersons, such messages occur with dream-images in the greek tradition along with the more commonplace predictions. The greek style of this dream contrasts with Archelaus' dream: visual symbols capable of interpretation have been replaced by a dream- image. Perhaps Josephus received the account of Glaphyra's dream from his sources, but creatively wove Archelaus' dream from biblical images. The repetition of both of these dreams with further 30 For the patterning of Daniel dreams upon the Joseph dreams see Gnuse, Dream , pp. 99-101. 31 Harold Attridge, The interpretation of Biblical history in the Antiquitates of Flavius Josephus , Harvard Dissertations in Religion, vol. 7 (Missoula, Montana: Scholars Press, 1976), pp. 61-62. 32 Messer, Dream , pp. 2-20, 24-30, 74-77, 83-90; and van Lieshout, Greeks, pp. 15- 18.</page><page sequence="15">372 ROBERT GNUSE elaboration in Antiquities of the Jews may add further credence ot this tentative supposition. Josephus at Jotapata: War III, 351-354 At one of the turning points in Josephus' life he remembered dreams (cppixo&gt;87) cpavraafjiaTa)33 dreadful in nature, which had predic- ted the future, and thus he decided to surrender to the Romans even though many comrades had died. This section in his work appears to be a plaintive self-justification of his capitulation after the fall of Jotapata, over which he had been the commander.34 Presumably the prediction of Vespasian's rise to emperor was rooted in these same dreams ( War III, 400-402). 35 The recalled dreams are described as 8vap in the text, or specifically "dreams of the night" (t&amp;v Siá vuxtòç ôvetpcov). He remembered them, even though originally God had sent them to reveal (7rpoea7)fi.evev) the impending fate (&lt;ju^&lt;pópaę) of the Jews and Romans. Thus received at a prior stage in his life these dreams were predictive. The expression, "ambiguous utterances" (àfjupiêóXox; ... XeyVeva) makes difficult for us to determine whether the dreams were auditory messages or visual- symbolic. However, the implication of spoken words indicates an auditory nature, but the term XeyVeva need not imply spoken words. The aspect of ambiguity coupled with Josephus' self-styled attribute of oneirocratic skill (xpíaeiç ôvetpcov) as necessary in decoding the dreams may imply the more vague visual-symbolic dream type. Likewise, calling them cpavrácr^axa may indicate visual experiences. Finally, this text is most important to us, for here is a statement by Josephus about his own personal involvement in dream interpreta- tion; and Josephus seems to connect dream interpretation with some form of priestly skills.36 Abimelech: Ant I, 208 Josephus' account contains the basic elements of the biblical text in Genesis 20, 37 although the dream theophany formula is not fully 33 Lindner, Geschichtsauffassung , pp. 52, 69, noted the term is used by the Romans, which leads us to suspect Josephus is concretely engaging in apologetic self-justification in his later years for the sake of royal patronage. 34 Rajak, Josephus , pp. 169-170. 36 Lindner, Geschichtsauffassung, p. 70; and Rajak, Josephus , pp. 185-195. 36 Reiling, Hermas, pp. 75-76; Rajak, Josephus, p. 19; and Beall, Essenes, p. 110. 37 Franxman, Genesis, pp. 24-27, 149-151, et passim, pointed out that generally Josephus did not alter the Genesis text in extensive fashion, as critics have observed in the past, rather his modifications were subtle and for significant reasons.</page><page sequence="16">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 373 preserved. Abimelech had a dream in which God admonished him not to violate Abraham's wife; the message is a very abbreviated version of the Genesis 20 text. The formula to describe the dream is: "he saw a dream in his sleep" (Ó7Tvcóaa&lt;; övap ópą). All three words in the greek are characteristic terms used in dream reports; the expression is even more terse than the common formula in Genesis 20:3: "God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him." Josephus did not translate the hebrew directly, nor did he use a fixed formula of his own, since the expression does not occur elsewhere in Josephus. Even though the verb is "to see," the original form of the account in Genesis can lead us to assume that Josephus was essentially rendering this as an auditory message dream. Abimelech's communication of the dream message upon awakening likewise implies that a verbal message was imparted. The dream seems to be auditory and provides directions to the recipient. Jacob at Bethel: Ant I, 279-284 Jacob's theophany at Bethel is rendered essentially as presented in the hebrew text, except the angels on the ladder become phantoms.38 The full dream report contains both visual and auditory communica- tion, as in the biblical text. Just as in Genesis Jacob is provided direction and promise of divine presence. The experience is described as a vision (o^tç), which Jacob saw (ópã) and in which God appeared (9atvó(jL£vov). Jacob was asleep (xarà touç 07tvoi&gt;ç), an expression often synonymous with dreaming. The experience is also termed a vision (êcopaptivoLç) late in the account. The visual aspect of the dream is underscored by use of the term, "he thought (ëSoÇev) he saw," the expression common to visual-symbolic dreams. But an auditory component is clearly present, for God called to Jacob (xaXéco) and provided a long message (I, 280-283). The content of the message is characteristic of auditory message dreams with emphasis upon divine direction and guidance. Thus this dream combines elements of the auditory message dream and the visual-symbolic dream, but the cause for this synthesis lies in the presence of both forms in the hebrew text. Certain ancient near eastern dreams which were of the auditory message type contained allusions to the appearance of the deity, but that motif was peripheral to the message, unlike the later 38 Ibid., pp. 185-187.</page><page sequence="17">374 ROBERT GNUSE greek dream-images where emphasis was placed upon the appearance of the dream-image. Jacob's dream report may have affinity with those reports. With this imagery in the hebrew text and Josephus' unconscious familiarity with greek dream-images he cast the present text in the form of a report which seems to be auditory and have a dream-image. The vision as a whole is said to "stand" (7rapa&lt;7Tã(rav) before Jacob, as greek dream-images do, and God is said to have been visible to Jacob (0èov èvapy&amp;ç oco tćo &lt;paivófjievov). This gives the dream the feel of an eïScoXov appearance. Thus Jacob's dream is in a special category, merging two types of dream report. Laban: Ant I, 313 The brief dream reference of Laban is to a divine warning typical of auditory message dreams. The dream reference is introduced by Laban's retiring for the night (yjaúxaÇev). God appeared (èmaTaç) in a dream (övap) and warned him not to harm Jacob. The brevity of the report would lead us to assume that, like the biblical text, this is an auditory message dream, except for the verb ítzigtòlç. This gives the impression of a visual dream-image of God. But that might be to infer too much from the incidental use of a verb. Hence, this dream appears to be an auditory message dream with a directive message, and the characteristics of an eiScoXov theophany may be associated with the dream only tentatively. Joseph: Ant II, 10-17 With the Joseph dreams we encounter clear examples of visual- symbolic dreams, for the nature of the biblical text would permit no other form of dream report. In the text of Josephus the accounts of Joseph are notably expanded, perhaps an indirect reflection upon the interest Josephus had in dream interpretation, since such a skill manifests itself most evidently in the Joseph narratives.39 In his first dream (II, 11-12) Joseph saw the sheaves symbolic of his family making obeisance to his sheaf, a foreshadowing of his future rise to power. The text describes Joseph's dream as different than everyday dreams (II, 11) the only such reference in Josephus to the distinctly different nature of revelatory dreams, even though all but 39 Ibid,, p. 285.</page><page sequence="18">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 375 one of Josephus' dream reports are revelatory. The second dream (II, 13-16) portrayed the sun, moon, and stars revering Joseph's star, another foreshadowing of his rise to power. Visual-symbolic dreams often come in pairs, since their ambiguity requires interpretation, two dreams lend greater certitude to the interpreted message.40 Josephus added the detail that Jacob interpreted the dreams, and did so correctly. Perhaps Josephus believed that since dreams came from God and a prophet must properly interpret them, a person could not interpret his or her own dreams, even though he or she might be a prophet.41 This would be a form of self-praise, for Josephus did indeed interpret his own dreams, a task that even Joseph could not undertake. Both reports are called a dream (ovap) and a vision (o^iç) repeatedly. Joseph is described as seeing them (ópáco and Oeáato). In the first account the expression xocxà toùç forvouç occurs in reference to ordinary dreams. In the second account the common visual-symbolic dream formula, ISoÇe, introduced the description of the dream. The second dream is said to be more marvelous (toXu... Oaufxaoruoxepav) than the first, a term which Josephus occasionally used in visual-symbolic and dream-image dream reports. Finally, a formula used for indicating the termination of a dream occurs in the first dream report: "he awoke" (Trepieyep Qziq). Consistently the Joseph dreams display the elements of visual-symbolic dreams, although they lack the tight formulaic structure evident in the hebrew text. Butler and Baker: Ant II, 63-73 The butler's dream, as in Genesis 40:9-15, is interpreted to imply the butler's return to pharaoh's court. In Josephus' version the interpretation of the motifs of the dream are altered, and the entire text is expanded;42 presumably Josephus sought to demonstrate his own oneirocritic virtuosity. The experience is called both a dream (ovap) and a vision (o^iç) several times, it is experienced in sleep (xaxa toùç u7tvouç), and it is seen (lScjv, from opaco). It is clearly a visual- symbolic dream predicting the future. The baker's dream in expanded also in comparison to the hebrew text in Genesis 40:16-19, though not as much as the more positive 40 Wikenhauser, ' ' Doppelträume, " pp. 100-111. 41 Franxman, Genesis , pp. 217, 224. 42 Ibid., pp. 239, 243-244.</page><page sequence="19">376 ROBERT GNUSE dream of the butler. The experience is called a dream (ovap) and a vision (6^tç) ; and the description of the scene is introduced with the characteristic idiom, ISoÇa. Again we have a predictive visual- symbolic dream paired with another, as is the custom with this genre, even though in this instance the two dreams reflect the fates of two different individuals. The pairing reminds us of the two dreams of Archelaus and Glaphyra in this regard. Pharaoh: Ant II, 75-86 The two dreams of pharaoh are not expanded as much in Josephus as the earlier dreams of the butler and the baker; the dreams are not recounted twice as in the biblical text of Genesis 41:1-7, 17-24, nor does Joseph's interpretation of the motifs vary from the biblical text. The experiences are called variously dreams (ovap and èvÚ7rviov) and visions (Ô^tç) experienced in sleep (xaxà xoùç forvouç). Pharaoh saw them (ópáo) and Oeáaco), and they "seemed" (èSóxet) to be evil. After the first dream of the cows there is a formal termination: "pharaoh awoke" (SisyepOeiç èxxou ötcvou). The second dream of the corn was more marvelous (Oaufjiaaiorrepov) than the first; the same was said of Joseph's second dream. As with so many visual-symbolic dreams professional interpreters were summoned unsuccessfully, and the prophetic figure alone interpreted the dreams. Joseph indicated that both dreams had the same meaning in predicting the future, a basic characteristic of symbolic dreams. Again we have two classic examples of predictive visual-symbolic dreams. Throughout the Joseph cycle of dreams Josephus seemed desirous of emphasizing and elaborating upon the biblical text, perhaps reflecting his own interests.43 But as Franxman observed: «Determined as Josephus seems to be to give slightly more sophisticated accounts of all dream interpretations, he has in this case unquestionably done less than justice to the treatment.»44 Jacob at Beersheba: Ant II, 172-176 The experience of Jacob at Beersheba is described quite similarly to the biblical text45 where Jacob is visited by God "visions of the night" and addressed with a double vocative prior to the giving of the 43 ibid., pp. 239, 243-244, 285. 44 Ibid., p. 244. 45 Ibid p. 272.</page><page sequence="20">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 377 message. Though the format is similar, the dream message is greatly elaborated by Josephus, but it still retains the basic themes of divine self-identification, promise of divine guidance, and direction, all typical of auditory message dreams in the hebrew text. The experience is called a dream (8vocp), the term occurs not in the introductory formula but only at the conclusion of the account. The auditory nature of the visitation is emphasized by God calling (xaXéco) to Jacob. But the expression, "God appeared to him" (èmaxaç ... 0eòç aÙTw), may imply a visual theophany, and the verb form is typical of the dream-image reports. Perhaps Josephus used the word incidently to reflect the hebrew idiom "visions of the night," or perhaps the greek dream-image format is merged with the auditory message dream format as was the case with the earlier dream of Jacob at Bethel. This ambiguity ironically occurs in all the dreams of the Jacob cycle (Jacob at Bethel, Laban, Jacob at Beersheba) either as a result of intimations in the hebrew text or due to an unconscious synthesis of dream report formats. Finally, there is a termination to the dream report: Jacob was "encouraged (Oappyjaaç) by the dream" and left for Egypt. Amram: Ani II, 212-217 Amram dreamed of the greatness of his son Moses in a dream experience which conforms nicely to the auditory message dream format of the Elohist dreams in Genesis. God appeared (ècpúrraTai) in a dream (xocxa to ùç fevouç) to him (auTto). This terse expression of five words resembles closely the hebraic formula in Genesis by listing divine theophany, dream reference, and recipient in an introductory formula. The oral message is long, beginning in indirect discourse and completed in direct quotation (II, 212-216). The content, like Elohist auditory message dreams, contains reassurance, promise of divine presence, and directions for the dreamer in a "salvation history" proclamation. Formal termination comes in II, 217: "these things revealed to him in a vision (o^iç), Amran on awaking (TrepLeyepOeíç)." Amram then told the content of the dream (ovap) to his wife. As a result they decided to have the child, Moses, and the course of their actions were altered, which is the usual result of auditory message dreams (both in Genesis and Matthew 1-2). This dream report has many of the components found in Elohist dream accounts. There is: situation prior to the theophany, divine theophany, dream reference, dream recipient, message of reassurance and promise of divine presence, formal termination listing the</page><page sequence="21">378 ROBERT GNUSE recipient's awakening, and subsequent action of the dreamer prompted by the dream, all listed in rather clear fashion. The formulaic language is not as stereotyped as that found in Genesis, however. Perhaps Josephus unconsciously used the terminology rather than employing it deliberately for effect, as is the case in Matthew's Infancy Narratives. Ehud (Judes): Ant V, 193 The reference by Ehud (or Judes, as Josephus calls him) to a dream is most likely a fabrication designed to enable Ehud to assassinate Eglon. The experience is called a dream (8vap) whether it existed or not. Such a reference is not found in the hebrew text. Midianite: Ant V, 219-222 The dream recounted by the Midianite soldier to his comrade and overheard by Gideon is retold as the hebrew text in Judges 7:13-15 recounts it. A visual-symbolic dream of a barley cake knocking down a Midianite tent was seen by the soldier, and his comrade interpreted it as a sign of the impending Israelite victory. Thus the visual- symbolic dream format occurs here: the dream is recounted and another person interpreted the component parts of the dream. The experience is described as both a dream (8vap) and a vision (8^lç) several times. The scene of the dream is introduced by the term èSóxei. The interpretation is provided in a terse expression (V, 220), and then the further elaboration is given (V, 220-221), a definite expansion of the hebrew text by Josephus. A form of termination may possibly be provided by the reference: "the hearing of this dream inspired Gideon." Samuel: Ant V, 348-351 Though the terminology for a dream or visionary experience is not found in the hebrew text or Josephus, the integrity of Samuel's experience as a dream (at least in part) has been defended elsewhere.46 The boy Samuel was asleep (xoL[xto(jievov) when God called him (xocXéco). If in any way Josephus perceived this as a dream experience (though the lack of at least the idiom xocxa tooç ôttvouç is an argument against this), it would be an auditory message dream which provides direction, in this case an oracle of judgment. 46 Gnuse, "I Samuel 3," pp. 379-390.</page><page sequence="22">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 379 Nathan: Ant VII, 147 The brief reference to Nathan's dream experience implies an auditory message dream was heard, an expression comparable to Samuel's reception of a message of judgment. Nathan was led to utter an oracle, itself an auditory message, so we would assume the initial communication was likewise oral. Nor is the presence of visual experience implied. The seven word formula in terse fashion declares that God appeared (&lt;ç&gt;&lt;xveí&lt;;) to Nathan in a dream (xara to ùç u7tvou&lt;;, which stands alone here to indicate a dream experience). The message, in indirect discourse, states that God found fault with the king, a message subsequently delivered to David. Short as it is, this dream report still contains many basic components of an auditory message dream: situation, theophany, recipient, dream reference, message, and response of the recipient. Like Amram's dream the introductory formula is brief but thorough and the word for sleep (07cvouç) refers to the dream. Ironically, the dreams of Amram and Nathan, not found in the hebrew text, correspond more closely to the auditory message dream format of Genesis than any of the renderings of those very same Genesis texts (Abimelech, Jacob, Laban, Jacob) by Josephus. Again the implication is that Josephus used this formulaic language only incidentally and by unconscious reflex. Solomon: Ant VIII, 22-25 The dream of Solomon reported in I Kings 3:5-15 is found to be slightly elaborated in Josephus, but the essential themes remain. It also tends to retain a formal set of expressions typical of an auditory message dream. The dream report is introduced by a terse eight word formula: "he appeared to him in sleep that night" (cpocvetç yap ocutco xaxà toùç u7cvouç èxeÉvTjç T 7)ç vuxtòç). The dream experience is identified by the phrase xaxà toùç 07rvoi&gt;ç. God is said to have appeared (cpavécù), the same verb used in dreams by Jacob at Bethel and Nathan, which may have the notion of physical manifestation. But the term may simply be a general word used here to imply presence of some form; it lacks the notion of concreteness asociated with è7rL&lt;rràç, ' 'stand over," which occurs in the dreams of Glaphyra, Laban, and Jacob at Beersheba. The time of the dream is identified as being at night (èxeivTjç r vjç</page><page sequence="23">380 ROBERT GNUSE voxtòç), an expression common for auditory message dreams in the hebrew text, but not common for Josephus. The dream contains dialogue, as do the dreams of Abimelech and Solomon in the hebrew text. The dream message is both promissory (but slightly different than the usual promise of divine accompaniment) and directive. Finally, there is a termination in a general way: "When Solomon heard these words of God he at once leaped up (àve7r7)$Y)&lt;jev, a different term than Josephus normally used) and did obeisance to Him." As in the biblical text this dream report seems to be an auditory message dream. It contains the basic components of that format: situation, theophany, recipient, dream reference, message, and termination. Solomon: Ant VIII, 125-129 Whereas the hebrew text does not use any dream formula in Solomon's second dream (I Kings 9:2 merely says the appearance was as the first at Gibeon), Josephus does provide dream terminology. His text slightly expands the hebrew but keeps the essential message. A terse eight word formula introduces the message: "a dream appeared to the king in his sleep" (Övap 8* è7CL&lt;pavèv tg&gt; ßaaiXsi xaxà toùç Ö7TVOIN;). The dream experience is identified by 8vap and xocrà toùç ôtivouç. God appeared, and the verbal root is related to çocvéto, as in previous texts. The message is not so much predictive as it is a conditional statement of what might occur with future Judean rulers - it seems to be more of a prophetic oracle, thus relating this dream experience to that of Samuel and Nathan. A more formal termination is provided for this dream than for the previous one by the idiom: "God spoke to him in his sleep" (ocòtcJ) tòv 0eòv eiTueiv xaxà toùç 07tvouç). This is likewise an auditory message dream, as the first dream. The component parts of the dream format are even more developed; they include: situation, dream reference (twice), theopha- ny, dream recipient, message, and formal termination. Again, the ironic observation must be made - where the hebrew text has no real dream report format Josephus has provided formulaic language akin to the dream reports in Genesis. Nebuchadnezzar: Ant X, 194-212 Though the material in Daniel is more in the genre of apocalyptic literature, the hebrew text identifies the experiences of Nebuchadnez- zar in Daniel 2:1-45 and 4:4-27 as dreams. Likewise, this nuance appears in Josephus, who considered these two dreams to be important, but paid little attention to the remaining Daniel visions.</page><page sequence="24">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 381 The first dream of Nebuchadnezzar wherein he saw a giant statue is retold by Josephus in a manner similar to the biblical text. Josephus hinted that there is more in the biblical text, however (X, 210), though he avoided any further discussion, for he did not wish to mention the popular Jewish notion that the final empire to be destroyed by the stone was equated with Rome.47 Above all, Josephus would not alienate his Roman audience. The experience of Nebuchadnezzar is called variously Övap, 8^iç, and èvÓ7Tviov quite frequently. In the initial formula the dream is described as öaufxacrnSv, a word used of visual-symbolic dreams. He observed the dream (i8¿ &gt;v, from ópáco) while asleep (xaxà toùç forvouç). As did pharaoh, he awoke and summoned professional interpreters (xaXSatouç, jjLáyouç, and [xávTeiç) who failed, but the prophetic personage alone rendered the true meaning. When Daniel interpreted the dream he also had to tell the king what the dream had been, as in the biblical text. He used the common term, eSoÇaç ópãv, the expression with symbolic dreams, and then explained each of the component parts of the dream. The experience was clearly a visual-symbolic dream which predicted the future, closely related to the Joseph dreams, as is the case also with the text in the hebrew.48 Nebuchadnezzar: Ant X, 216-217 Directly following the first dream report is the second dream of Nebuchadnezzar, for Josephus had greater interest in the dreams than the narrative materials in Daniel. The second dream predicted future insanity for the king. Josephus abbreviated this account greatly compared to the biblical text. The experience is called 8&lt;1»tç and èvÚ7rvtov (8vap may be omitted inadvertently owing to the brevity of the account). It was experien- ced while the king was asleep (xaxa to ùç 07tvouç). He saw it (ópáco and öeaaco). Again he called the magi (jjLáyouç) who failed, but Daniel succeeded. Josephus observed that, ''Daniel alone interpreted it, and as he foretold to him so it came to pass," an expression which sounds formulaic, but it appears nowhere else. This dream, like the first, is a visual-symbolic predictive dream. It may be forced to say that the 47 Jay Braverman, Jerome's Commentary On Daniel: A Study of Comparative Jewish and Christian Interpretations of the Hebrew Bible, CBQMS , vol. 7 (Washington: Catholic Biblical Association, 1978), pp. 110-111. 48 Gnuse, Dream , pp. 99-101.</page><page sequence="25">382 ROBERT GNUSE Nebuchadnezzar dreams are paired as clearly as the three pairs of Joseph dreams. But their placement together in Josephus' text gives that impression more than the biblical text in Daniel, which has a narrative account separating the dreams. Jaddus: Ant XI, 326-328 Jaddus, the high priest, feared the approach of the Macedonian army, so he initiated public sacrifice and general prayer among the Jews. After the sacrifice he fell asleep and experienced a dream theophany, which makes the cultic activity appear to us as a form of dream incubation. He arose from sleep and announced the dream to the people, as though they were awaiting just such a sign. However, the terse nature of the text makes it difficult to assume deliberate incubation; inadvertant or indirect dream incubational process in a sacred place may be operative here, as with Jacob at Bethel and later at Beersheba, and Samuel at Shiloh. (The dream of Solomon appears to be more deliberately incubated at Gibeon, since he went there for a particular purpose, while Jacob was passing through the two sites of his dream experiences.) Perhaps, Josephus refrained from portraying cultic activity which would appear to manipulate a message from God, so he left references to incubation ambiguous, as did the earlier biblical texts.49 Jaddus experienced a dream (xocrà toùç utcvoin;) in which God spoke (èxp^jxáTiaev) to him. The message rendered in indirect discourse provided encouragement (Oappeiv, the same verb used of Jacob at Beersheba) and directions for action, the usual content of auditory message dreams in Genesis. Formal termination of the dream occurs with the expression: "he arose from sleep" (Stavaaxáç 8è ex tou Ö7tvou). This auditory message dream contains most of the parts of a dream report: situation, theophany, dream recipient, dream reference, message, termination, and response of the recipient, the full form used in the Genesis account, even though it is not as developed as Amram's or Solomon's second dream. Theopompos: Ani XII, 112-113 The simple reference to the dream (övap) of Theopompos makes it difficult to determine whether it was auditory or visual, but the 49 Ehrlich, Traum , pp. 18-19, 35.</page><page sequence="26">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 383 nature of the message might imply that the dream was auditory. The verb form "to see" (elSev) could imply a visual experience, but this is not necessarily the case, since the meaning of the verb (opaco) can include wide range of semantic possibility. Theopompos learned from his dream that his previously experienced mental disturbances were caused by his undue curiosity about divine things and a desire to disclose them to the public. He then gave up his intentions. Thus the message might be called a warning or directive and its impact changed the course of the dream recipient's plans. The message is then comparable to the warning or directions given in the dreams of Abimelech and Laban. It would be easier to envision this message as oral rather than visual. Hyrcanus: Ant XIII, 32250 The dream received by Hyrcanus is likewise a dream reference. From the text, however, we can ascertain that the dream contained both auditory and visual elements. The combination of auditory and visual elements might imply an eïScoXov appearance. The dream is predominantly visual, however, since the only reference to audition is the spoken question of Hyrcanus, and no indication is given of divine speech. The dream is either visual-symbolic or an eíScoXov appearance, with greater probability for the former category. God appeared (cpavevTa) in a dream (xaxa to ùç utcv ouç) to Hyrcanus (aÙTo&gt;). The terse stereotypic formula contains in five words the elements of theophany, dream reference, and recipient. Dialogue occurs (as with Abimelech in Genesis) which is initiated by Hyrcanus. Inquiring as to his successor Hyrcanus learned by the appearance of an image (xapaxTïjpaç) that Alexander would succeed him. In this regard, it is difficult to tell whether there was a dream-image of God in addition to the symbol observed by Hyrcanus. Thus a visual dream with no apparent dream-image implies a symbolic dream rather than an eíScoXov. Herod: Ant XIV, 451 The reference to dreams of Herod mentioned by Josephus in the War of lhe Jews is recorded again here as experiences existing at some time in the past for Herod. The experiences are again called dreams 50 Ferrari D'Occhieppo, Der Stern der Weisen : Geschichte oder Legende, 2nd ed. (Vienne: n.p., 1977), pp. 62-64, has evaluated this dream in detail.</page><page sequence="27">384 ROBERT GNUSE (8vap), and a visual nature is somewhat implied by the verb from opaco. Likewise the dreams foreshadow (Trpocpaivoúaaç) his brother's death, and symbolic dreams characteristically predict the future. If the dreams were auditory with clear communication, one would expect only one dream to suffice, but visual-symbolic dreams often come in pairs to insure clarity of interpretation. Thus these dreams may be classified as visual-symbolic dreams tentatively. Matthias: Ani XVII, 166 The dream of Matthias may be the only authentic dream-like experience in Josephus. Matthias, the high priest, was rendered impure by a dream (Övap) in which he seemed (eSoÇev) to have intercourse with a woman. The visual nature of the dream and the use of the verb Soxéco implies a visual-symbolic dream. But the self- involvement of the dreamer is not typical of symbolic dreams, and the nature of the imagery reflects the real human psyche. Rather than a symbolic dream, we have an existential dream, the third category of Oppenheim: everyday dreams of common people, usually not recorded lest they bring impurity upon the dreamer (as is obviously the case with Matthias). Archelaus: Ant XVII, 345-348 Another account found in War of the Jews is repeated here with several variations. Archelaus tells his friends that he seemed (SóÇa) to observe in his dream (Övap xotovSe, the same expression used earlier) that "ten thick ears of wheat that had reached their full growth were being eaten by oxen." The number has been changed from nine to ten by Josephus, and the verb form has changed from opaco to 0eáa&lt;o (which then corresponds to Glaphyra's following dream report). Formal termination of the dream report has been added with Archelaus' awakening (izzpieyp6[ievo&lt;;). The interpretative motifs of Simon the Essene have changed somewhat, for now oxen denote suffering, since they are beasts of burden, and their ploughing the earth implies change, hence the end of Archelaus' rule. Finally, a declaration of interpretative certitude has been added (XVII, 347): "this was how Simon interpreted the dream," a formula reminiscient of the expression used by Josephus to conclude the Daniel dream reports. The expression also reminds us of formulas in the hebrew text like, "this is the interpretation" (Genesis 40:12, 18), "the interpreta- tion of the dream is one" (Genesis 41:25, 26), "we will tell the interpretation" (Daniel 2:36), "the dream is sure, and the interpreta-</page><page sequence="28">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 385 tion is to be trusted" (Daniel 2:45), all which indicate interpretative certitude. The additions and modifications in this text indicate Josephus was influenced by the stereotypical format of biblical dream reports, especially the Joseph and Daniel dreams. The addition of ôeáaco as the verb of seeing standardized the dream with other visual-symbolic dreams (i.e., pharaoh's dreams) as well as the subsequent dream of Glaphyra, the addition of formal termination brings the account closer to the format of dreams in general (but especially auditory message dreams), and the statement of certitude reflects increased influence of Joseph and Daniel dreams, which may have been initially foundational for the Archelaus dream report. This seems to be further evidence of Josephus' unconscious patterning of dream reports to conform to established types, a process accelerated in later works. Glaphyra: Ant XVII, 349-353 The dream of Glaphyra again follows directly after Archelaus' dream as in War of the Jews. In her dream (tolovSe ovap, the same term as used for Archelaus'dream) she thought (è&amp;óxei) that she saw (0ea&lt;i&lt;o, the same verb as in Archelaus' dream report) Alexander, her former husband standing (émcrravTa, the same verb as used in the account found in War of the Jews ) before her to condemn her for marrying his brother. The dream report varies little from the earlier version of the same, save for the addition of the expressions xoíovSe ovap and 0eacra[xév7), perhaps drawn from the report of Archelaus to standardize both reports. Comparing the development of the dreams of Archelaus and Glaphyra from their earlier to their later versions one notices more modification in the dream report of Archelaus. This may imply that Josephus received the dream report of Glaphyra in rather fixed form, while the dream of Archelaus could have been flexibly molded by biblical patterns of speech - again, an unconscious process in the writings of Josephus. Monobazus: Ant XX, 18 The dream of Monobazus is an auditory voice from the heavens. While sleeping with his hand on his pregnant wife's belly, he thought he heard (eSoÇev u7raxouetv) a voice (cpomję tlvoç) telling him to remove his hand. In indirect discourse Josephus informs us of the message not to cramp the unborn child, since the baby would have a good future. Thus more than just a voice was heard, a verbal message was provided. This distinguishes the experience from those in which a</page><page sequence="29">386 ROBERT GNUSE mere noise is heard at a symbolic or crucial point in time. The theophany has a termination: Monobazus is disturbed (xapaxôetç) and he awakened (eù0ùç SieyepGeiç). He immediately told his wife the dream as had Amran. In terms of influence the dream is difficult to assess. The auditory voice from the heavens is reminiscient of the Elohist motif in the Pentateuch of having God speak from the heavens, but the voice or loud noise from the heavens is likewise a characteristic of a separate greek category of theophanic experiences which are purely auditory. In general, auditory dream reports of the ancient Near East have been replaced by greek dream-image reports, so this category of auditory voices from the heavens may be the remnant of the old ancient near eastern form. If so, we might be tempted to classify Monobazus' dream as an auditory dream, but of greek origin rather than biblical. In several respects, such as the use of the term «pcovyjç, this dream stands by itself in the collection of Josephus' dream reports. Josephus in Galilee: Life, 208-210 An extremely significant dream in the life of Josephus was the marvelous vision (Gaufxáaiov) beheld in his dream (8vap) where he seemed to behold (ôeáato) a man standing before him (emcrrdcvTa) who spoke to him. Throughout the report has the basic language of a classic greek dream-image report, like those of Glaphyra in both versions. The dream-image provided reassurance and the promise of the presence of good fortune (rather than divine presence, as we find in auditory message dreams). A clear termination is provided by the expression: "cheered by this dream vision I arose." The dream is one of the few etScoXov reports in Josephus. Stratonice: Ap I, 207 A very vague allusion to Stratonice's dream (evwrviov) is provided in which Stratonice followed the direction of a dream and was killed as a result. The story is recounted by Agatharchides to ridicule her superstition and to subsequently conclude (I, 211) that dreams ought not be followed seriously. It is the only reference in Josephus to a deceptive dream (they do occur in Homer). Whether it was auditory or visual cannot be determined. Amenophis: Ap I, 289 Pharaoh Amenophis, who lived fifteen hundred years before</page><page sequence="30">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 387 Josephus wrote this account, was said to have experienced a dream (xaxà toòç unvouç) in which Isis appeared (ecpavv)) to him and rebuked him for the destruction of her temple. Whether the goddess appeared visually as a dream-image cannot be determined, since the verb occurs with many auditory dreams. The nature of the message implies auditory phenomena with the clear statement of judgment (Samuel, Nathan, Solomon's second dream). CONCLUSION The dream reports of Josephus do not fall into a simple pattern, rather they tend to fall unconsciously into categories such as the biblical auditory message dream, the biblical visual-symbolic dream, or the greek etScoXov dream, which is somewhat related to the visual- symbolic dream. Our tentative classification has emerged as follows: 1) Auditory Message Dreams - dreams of Abimelech, Jacob at Bethel (in part), Laban (in part), Jacob at Beersheba (in part), Amram, Samuel (if it is a dream), Nathan, Solomon's two dreams, Jaddus, Theopompos (perhaps), Monobazus (perhaps), and Amenophis (per- haps); 2) Visual-Symbolic Dreams - Herod (both versions), Archelaus (both versions), Josephus at Jotapata, Joseph's two dreams, butler, baker, pharaoh's two dreams, Midianite, Nebuchadnezzar's two dreams, and Hyrcanus (perhaps); and 3) Dream-Images - clear exam- ples include Glaphyra (both versions) and Josephus in Galilee, while three dreams may have some aspect of the dream-image style due to the nature of the original hebrew text: Jacob at Bethel, Laban, and Jacob at Beersheba. Unclassifiable dreams include those of Ehud and Stratonice, while the dream of Matthias was like that of psychological status dreams. The classification of these dreams cannot be held rigidly owing to the brevity of many of the texts, and more importantly because Josephus did not consciously seek to fit his dream reports into such categories. Nevertheless, the ability to categorize many of the dreams, especially those with no parallel in the hebrew text indicates that in some way he unconsciously conformed to the accepted patterns of dream reporting, especially those of the biblical text. A closer consideration of the vocabulary likewise indicates there are some patterns in the dream reports. They are not fixed as cleanly as the formulas in the Elohist dreams of Genesis or Matthew's</page><page sequence="31">388 ROBERT GNUSE dreams, nonetheless the patterns indicate more than mere random- ness of language. The key observations are to be made concerning the use of terms denoting dreams. The two most frequently used words, ovap and 6^iç, tend to be interchangeable, and are often found together with 07rvouç and èvÓ7Tvtov as synonyms. But some patterns emerge: 1) When 6vap and ô^iç are used together (Joseph's two dreams, butler, baker, pharaoh's two dreams, Amram, Midianite, Nebuchadnezzar's first dream) in all but Amram's dream a visual-symbolic dream is described. 2) is used alone only in conjunction with Jacob's dream at Bethel, while ovap is used a number of times by itself (Herod in both versions, Archelaus in both versions, Glaphyra in both versions, Josephus at Jotapata, Abimelech, Laban, Ehud, Solomon's second dream, Theopompos, Matthias, and Josephus in Galilee) for both auditory and visual dreams. 3) (tav ooç generally occurs alone with auditory dreams (Nathan, Solomon's first dream, Jaddus, Hyrcanus, and Amenophis) with only the dream of Hyrcanus being problematic; otherwise in conjunction with other dream terminology 07rvouç may be associated with any dream type. 4) ovap tolovSs occurs only with symbolic dreams or dream-images (Archelaus in both versions, and Glaphyra in Ant). 5) Ivutcvlov is used generally in symbolic dreams (pharaoh's two dreams, Nebuchadnezzar's two dreams, and perhaps Stratonice). Hence, it appears that Josephus did not consciously delineate Övap as dream for auditory message dreams, and Ô^lç as vision for visual-symbolic dreams. But he tends to favor the usage of èvÚ7rvtov, and övap tolovSs with visual-symbolic dreams and fevouç with auditory message dreams. Other terminology associated with dream report formats are used by Josephus with some consistency: 1) Soxéco in various forms is used with visual-symbolic dreams or dream-images (Archelaus in both versions, Glaphyra in both versions, Jacob at Bethel, Joseph's second dream, baker, pharaoh's two dreams, Midianite, Nebuchadnezzar's first dream, Matthias, and Josephus in Galilee), the exception being the unusual dream of Monobazus. 2) OaufxácjLoç/OaofjiaaTÓç are adjecti- ves used to describe visual-symbolic dreams or dream-images (Joseph's second dream, pharaoh's second dream, Nebuchadnezzar's first dream, and Josephus in Galilee). 3) Oeáaco is used with visual- symbolic dreams or dream-images (Joseph's two dreams, pharaoh's two dreams, Nebuchadnezzar's second dream, Archelaus in Ant , Glaphyra in Ant , and Josephus in Galilee). 4) ópáco is more frequently used with visual-symbolic dreams (Joseph's first dream, butler,</page><page sequence="32">DREAM REPORTS IN THE WRITINGS OF FLAVIUS JOSEPHUS 389 pharaoh's two dreams, Nebuchadnezzar's two dreams, Herod, in Ant , and Archelaus in War), but it also occurs in auditory dreams (Abimelech, Jacob at Bethel, and Theopompos). 5) &lt;paLv&lt;o more frequently occurs with auditory dreams (Jacob at Bethel, Nathan, Solomon in both dreams, and Amenophis), but it is used in the symbolic dream of Hyrcanus (though that dream does have an auditory component). 6) e&lt;picmr)[AL, ítzígtohioli, and 7rapí&lt;mr)fAL occur obviously with dream-images and dreams in the Jacob cycle (Glaphyra in both versions, Jacob at Bethel, Laban, Jacob at Beersheba, and Josephus in Galilee), but strangely occurs in Amram's auditory dream. The use of certain terms with either auditory or visual dreams may be coincidental, due to the very nature of each dream, but at least there is consistent usage. More significant is the content of the message in these dreams, as we have classified them. The message in auditory dreams is almost always directive. In three instances (Samuel, Nathan, and Solomon's second dream) the directive message is that of judgment. Only the auditory dream of Monobazus is predictive, but this dream is quite irregular as a greek-influenced auditory message dream. Solomon's dreams also add a promissory element, but this is not so far removed from the patriarchal dreams in Genesis which are directive with the promise of divine presence. All the visual-symbolic dreams are predictive. Only the dream of Hyrcanus is problematic, but the visual element seems more important than the auditory. Dream-image theophanies mix categories: the two versions of Glaphyra are predictive, and the Josephus in Galilee dream is directive, while the three dreams with some apparent dream-image influence in the Jacob cycle are directive. These observations square with the dream report formats as they were used prior to Josephus. Auditory message dreams tended to be directive in the ancient Near East and the Hebrew Bible, visual-symbolic dreams tended to be predictive in the Hebrew Bible (they were not too frequent in the ancient Near East), and greek efôtoXov dreams can be either directive or predictive. Thus it appears to this author that Josephus has conformed to the pattern of dream reports in the ancient world in regard to correlating message content with dream type. This study hopefully provides an insightful commentary into the dream reports of Josephus. Though he did not use a rigorous literary form to communicate his dream reports, he has at times used very loosely the formulaic language of his age in a way which conforms to the usual patterns of dream narration. To this author's subjective</page><page sequence="33">390 ROBERT GNUSE point of view it seems that Josephus has been influenced unconscious- ly by formulaic language in his writing style. Though many of the dream reports are loose in their articulation, at times a concise formula appears, and throughout the content of the message and purpose of the dream correspond quite consistently to the dream format used. This essay may be a stimulus to further thought in this area of Josephus studies. Dept. Religious Studies Loyola University New Orleans, LA 70118 Spring, 1989 Robert Gnuse.</page></plain_text>
