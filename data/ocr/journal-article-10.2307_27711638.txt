<plain_text><page sequence="1">Playing with Reason: Aspects of Hooker's Rhetoric in Lawes I-V A. D. Cousins, Macquarie University The words beginning the first book of Richard Hooker's Of the Laives of Ecclesiasticall Politie allude to dissident rhetoric: "He that goeth about to perswade a multitude, that they are not so well governed as they ought to be, shall never want attentive and favourable hearers ..." (I.i).1 There Hooker indicates his interest in the tactical problems of persuasion and foreshadows his role as spokesman for the current organization of the En glish church. In the following discussion, though I do not essay a compre hensive account of Hooker's rhetoric?which is necessarily the topic for a monograph?I do seek to pursue both implications of his opening re mark, briefly considering in general the rhetoric through which he inno vatively reworks the conformist case (just how innovatively has been per suasively argued by Peter Lake), and focusing especially on those moments of his text where he attempts to seal an argument with set-pieces in the major modes demonstratio or pragmatographia.2 The pivotal argument put forward is that looking closely at those moments of rhetorical emphasis or climax shows how astutely Hooker, an insistent advocate of reason, can deliberately diminish the importance of reason as a persuasive tactic and try domination of his readers through a rhetoric of unreason, one trans gressing the rules of logic and (or) of emotional rather than primarily logical coherence. Perceiving that, it is also argued, illuminates the inter textual relationships forming Hooker's rhetorical practice?in particular, its relationship to Ciceronian style and theory. i.

For Hooker, it seems still accurate to suggest by way of beginning, the universe is or dered by the Divine Reason as embodied in eternal law and mediated to the creation?that is to say, particularly to humankind?by a sequence of dependent laws (I.3.1 ) .4 As a rationally designed and governed construct, the universe is of necessity concordant: "all things," unless disturbed, ex ist and function harmoniously in terms of "measure, number, and waighf (1.2.3); moreover, reason, order, and the Good are self-evidently one (I.7.2-4). Hooker's point is inevitably that, in such a universe, to commit a significant act of disorder will be at once immoral and self-destructive? in other words, irrational. And that is precisely his accusation against the presbyterians (which has relevance also to other puritans). Hooker sees them as refusing to acknowledge that humans live within a (Thomist) scheme of interdependent laws and as trying to sever revelation from rea son. Hooker insists, byway of contradiction, that revelation complements reason, perfects it, and is meant to be scrutinized by it; he iterates and reiterates Thomas's notion that grace perfects the natural but does not supplant it (see 1.2.4; I.3.1; 1.8.3-8; 1.12.3; III.8.11-15, and so on). He proposes that revealed law must be interpreted and administered in the contexts of the laws of reason and of nature, which are the same (1.8.9, among many instances). To claim the self-sufficiency of revealed law, ac cording to Hooker's orthodox and impassioned argument, is not only to misrepresent it but ultimately to frustrate it. Furthermore, to make that claim is to attack the network of laws sustaining life and so to become an outsider, an advocate of disorder, a mediator of the Other. The social implications of his position are presented distinctly in Book Five. Hook er asserts that as the values in fact basic to social order are located, in their 3- On the idea of reason as arbiter see 1.6.6-1.7.1 .

Now Hooker sees the church?whatever else one might take it to be?as society in its highest form, so for him the frustration of revealed law finally and more obviously means an attacking of the church itself (all those views pervade V. 1 ). To appreciate even a little of Hooker's thought on reason is indeed a preliminary to understanding how unreason can function in his rhetoric. But there is a further preliminary, and the preceding discussion leads directly to it. Hooker's thought on reason clarifies his interest in Cicero nian style and theory; that is to say, it clarifies Hooker's choice of the rhe torical mode within which his persuasive uses of unreason are subsequently manifested. It is apparent that Hooker wants to promote the idea of rea son's being the basis of rhetoric, and that he wants to do so because rhet oric will then be perceived as having the same foundation as the structure of reality: rhetoric will become in effect a component of his world view and indisseverable from it. To affirm that, Hooker of course cites Christ? the Logos himself?and the Apostles as examples of public speakers bas ing what they say on reason (III.8.17). (He thereby implies that a rheto ric of religious dispute, unless rational, cannot be in imitation of Christ's; thus he discredits presbyte r?an and related notions of centering discourse on revelation.) Yet if Hooker's identification, through reason, of rheto ric with his world view allows him to suggest the Logos as the divine pre cedent and authority behind his own writings?a particularized Logocen trism?at the same time it puts him in an advantageous position to appropriate Cicero as the most potent secular authority available in Tu dor rhetorical theory. It is not hard to see why the latter should be so. Cicero depicts in Som nium Scipionis a hierarchic and concordant universe whose rational order resembles that of the world view described in Hooker's work.5 Moreover, in De Inventione Cicero explicitly connects rhetoric with his cosmology: the mythic orator who, early in the work, first establishes society among hu mankind does so by imposing the rational order of his own soul upon his fellows and thus bringing rational human nature into unison with the harmonies of the heavens.6 His oratory?the primal rhetoric, according to Cicero?has to be recognized as manifesting essentially the same ratio nality as that which governs the surrounding universe. Those themes re cur in both De Oratore and Brutus; in the former, Cicero implies that the harmonies of oratorical prose reflect the congruences informing nature 5- Cf. Africanus's description of the heavens. 6. See DeInventione, I.1.1-I.2.2, in DeInventione, De Optimo Genere Oratorum, T?pica, trans. H. M. Hubbell, Loeb Classical Library (1949; rpt.

Press, i960).</page><page sequence="4">18o Cousins and the spheres.7 The obvious affinities between Hooker and Cicero need no underlining and are enough to indicate at least why Hooker might want to align his rhetorical practice with Cicero's, for thereby he could evoke authoritative Ciceronian ideas of cosmology, of social order, and of rhet oric's connections with both. Nonetheless, one can make more specific suggestions. First, Cicero's implication in De Oratore that oratorical prose and the order of things are linked at once structurally and aesthetically expresses his general inclina tion to see human art, especially rhetoric, and the universe as manifest ing identical principles of beauty.8 Hooker perceives the divine configu ration of reality to be rational and also beautiful; he asserts, predictably, that reality's design is both structurally and aesthetically perfect (1.2.5; I.8.1; cf. Li 1.6). Hooker, then, seems to imitate Cicero's style because it derives from, and its harmonies affirm the principles of, an aesthetic sim ilar to his own. Second, Hooker imitates Cicero's style because Cicero asserts in his works of rhetorical theory, and indicates in various of his orations, that the distinctive function of rhetoric is to defend rational social order against the forces of unreason and disruption. Finally, a number of conservative Tudor rhetoricians and political theorists had long acknowl edged Cicero's preeminent authority as a theorist on the role and con texts of rhetoric by closely imitating the argument proposed in the early sections of De Inventione and developed thereafter. In imitating Cicero's style, therefore, Hooker is identifying himself with the man that Elyot, Wilson, and Puttenham use as a source for some of their basic ideas.9 II In what follows, I want now to examine Hooker's Ciceronian imitation and to focus on unreason in his set-pieces, the aims being to consider Hooker's strategic, atypical diminution of reason, as well as to suggest the flexibility of his Ciceronian manner?something widely overlooked. The place to begin is a brief passage from Hooker's Preface, a pragmatographia of Calvin's attempt to justify scripturally his reorganization of the church in Geneva: 7- De Oratore, 3.6, in De Oratore, trans.

That which Calvin did for es tablishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable then that which he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in us all a love to our owne counsels. The contradiction of others is a fanne to inflame that love. Our love set on fire to maintaine that which once we have done, sharpneth the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all meanes to reason for it. Wherefore a marvaile it were if a man of so great capacitie, having such in citements to make him desirous of all kind of furtherances unto his cause, could espie in the whole Scripture of God nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that divine authoritie it selfe was the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the wit even of Calvin was able from thence to drawe, by sifting the very utmost sentence and syllable, is no more then that certaine speeches there are which to him did seeme to inti mate that all Christian Churches ought to have their Elderships indued with power of excommunication, and that a part of those Elderships every where should be chosen out from amongst the laitie after that forme which him selfe had framed Geneva unto. But what argument are yee able to showe, whereby it was ever prooved by Calvin, that any one sentence of Scripture doeth necessarily enforce these thinges, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his against the orders of your owne Church? (Preface, II.7) What one perceives immediately here, as far as the emotional tenor of the passage can be discerned, might be called a certain restrained condescen sion delivered through an uncomplicated dialectic. In fact, however, Hooker's relating of emotion to reason for persuasive effect is much more shrewd than that. In the Preface to Hooker's Lawes, Calvin is forcefully present as a for midable opponent: formidable because learned, politically influential, and respected. The passage quoted above shows, I think, Hooker trying early in his work to assume some control over Calvin, to displace him if possi ble, as a figure of ecclesiological authority dangerous at once to the con formist cause and to himself as defensor fidei. At first it looks as if Hooker tries to transcend the authority of Calvin by a condescending reasonable ness, as I have just observed. The opening of the passage, with its plain and direct speech, seems to discredit Calvin through an axiomatic argu ment ("Nature worketh ... to reason for it") that leads to revelation of the great man as, after all, humanly fallible in his self-love. One seems to see Calvin scratching through Scripture for a kind of selfjustification?which he cannot find. But virtually all this is a cunning illusion. Hooker's plain style implies, until the final sentence, intimacy, shared common sense, and yet the patronizing argument it unfolds does not have, for all its being axiomatic, a necessary truth. After all, reason, which Hooker persuasively celebrates throughout his work, can sometimes convince a person deci sively and rapidly that even a cherished belief or opinion is in fact wrong; moreover, a person may sometimes be so convinced by unreason. The reasonableness of the argument and its rhetoric is more apparent than</page><page sequence="6">18 2 Cousins real. Thus the elaborately ironic conclusion drawn from that argument, aimed at discrediting Calvin ("Wherefore a marvaile it were . . ."), has no genuinely logical force. Even so, it would be inaccurate to infer that if the passage depreciates reason to amplify emotion through false logic?for Hooker's false argumentation leads to his mock-pitying of Calvin?then a condescending description of Calvin in action must be its strategy. The point is, of course, that Hooker follows an unreasonable argument with a mere caricature of Calvin in action, a calculatedly distorting pragmatograph ia: one could hardly be said to receive a verifiable representation of him at work or to see any of his words. Hooker does not, in that sense, show the reader Calvin but a usefully satiric icon of him?a to-be-representa tive image fashioned here to allow Hooker an easy victory over his oppo nent and to facilitate/prefigure other victories. Moreover, while Hooker certainly wants to achieve that, he clearly wants something further: to end with victory over Calvin's presbyterian heirs rath er than with victory merely over Calvin himself. The final sentence of the passage is crucial here. Breaking the intimacy of address created until now by Hooker's plain speech, the aggressive last sentence turns the emotion previously directed at Calvin against Hooker's adversaries. Calvin having been treated with wry condescension, at least on the issue of church disci pline, Hooker unexpectedly turns to address those who have based their concepts of church reform on Calvinist principle.10 One sees that they are meant suddenly to find themselves included in the patronizingly dismiss ive treatment of their master; Hooker adroitly transfers the emotional weight of the passage onto them. They are meant suddenly to recognize themselves as the blind and humiliated followers of a blind guide. Hooker pauses there and then quickly goes on to praise Calvin, though, of course, the praise is qualified by an emphatic use of the word "indus trie" (Preface, II.8). But the damage has already been skillfully and irrep arably done; in the Preface to his Lawes, Hooker's survey of Calvin's work in Geneva comes to a climax with that denigration of both Calvin and his English heirs. One consideration remains, then, at this point: the plain style whose ironic intimacy and false reasonableness allow the passage to function so well. The natural context of Hooker's deft plainness is the English tradition of Attic prose and so ultimately the Ciceronian model of a plain stylist (Orator, 23.76ft0.), with its emphasis on subtlety and wit. Now discussion of Hooker's Ciceronian imitation has tended to focus exclusively on the hierarchic patterning of his prose, on its elaborate ?o. That is to say, he uses the tactic of quaestium: a question being asked in order for the speaker to achieve emotional emphasis.</page><page sequence="7">Aspects of Hooker's Rhetoric 183 rhythms, but to ignore its variety and flexibility.11 Here it can be seen that if Hooker's prose may fit some long conventional ideas of "Ciceronian" style in sixteenth-century England, then nonetheless the strategic diver sity of his Ciceronianism also has to be acknowledged, including his use of what seems a calculatedly unreasonable Attic style. Noting that serves to introduce a quite different and more usually dis cussed aspect of Hooker's Ciceronian imitation: his use of the high style. Cicero thought that without mastery of the high style no orator could fulfill his archetypal, civilizing role.12 In Orator he describes it as manipulating an audience's senses, emotions, and thoughts. He goes on to say that the speaker using it seems himself to be overcharged with feeling, and is ap parently unmindful of the logical niceties of discourse (28, passim)?all of which form an oratorical ideal far removed from that of a "gentlemanly" plainness, as described earlier in Orator and celebrated in De OfficiisP Hooker seems to imitate the Ciceronian version of the high style in the first book of his Lowes where, through a pragmatographia of universal dis order, he seeks to seal his argument that without obedience to law there can exist nothing truly creative or fruitful, in short, no life as humankind knows it. The much and justly admired passage runs: Now if nature should intermit her course, and leave altogether, though it were but for a while, the observation of her own lawes: if those principall and mother elements of the world, wherof all things in this lower world are made, should loose the qualities which now they have, if the frame of that heavenly arch erected over our heads should loosen and dissolve it selfe: if celestiall spheres should forget their wonted motions and by irregular volubilitie, turne them selves any way as it might happen: if the prince of the lightes of heaven which now as a Giant doth runne his unwearied course, should as it were through a languishing faintnes begin to stand and to rest himselfe: if the Moone should wander from her beaten way, the times and seasons of the yeare blend them selves by disordered and confused mixture, the winds breath out their last gaspe, the cloudes yeeld no rayne, the earth be defeated of heavenly influence, the fruit?s of the earth pine away as children at the withered breasts of their mother no longer able to yeeld them reliefe, what would become of man him selfe, whom these things now do all serve? See we not plainly that obedience of creatures unto the lawe of nature is the stay of the whole world? (1.3.2) 11.

Press, 1961).</page><page sequence="8">184 Cousins What I want to suggest about this passage is not that its logic breaks down? though its logic is by no means beyond query?but rather that while di rectly putting forward one logically based and powerfully emotive case to confirm an argument previously unfolded, it indirectly puts forward an other, at this point emotional rather than logical, which in effect forms the basis of an argument yet to come. In what might be called, for the sake of convenience, the set piece's direct case, Hooker confronts the reader with an essentially teleological argument whose logical structure and, to a large extent, emotional force are generated by his tracing but negating the universe's supposed design. That is to say, in doing the latter he at once develops the logical sequence of his case and tries to manipulate the reader's emotions through an amplificatory rhetoric of comprehensio and incrementum. His heightening of emotion in the set-piece is, then, both obvious and tied to reason, his proposal being that a reasoned survey of nature's aberration from law (of nature become, as it were, irrational) must evoke only terror. Within the passage's comprehensio and incrementum many specific emotional effects are created by conformado, and it is on Hooker's use of personification that I want to focus. After stating its hypothesis ("Now if nature should intermit . . .") the passage moves directly to an image of motherhood, ending its picture of universal disorder with another; moreover, both images refer to the earth and so begin as well as finish the cosmic picture with men tion of our home. That astutely familial emphasis, registering a cosmolog ical economy in terms of a domestic one, is rhetorically apt, reasonable, and highly emotive. On the other hand, not everything else in the picture functions so reasonably. Hooker's elaborate, if brief, personifying of the "celestiall spheres" gestures easily?and understandably enough?towards making their now "irregular volubilitie" look menacing, yet Hooker choos es not to specify how their arbitrariness, while of course potentially dan gerous, would of necessity be destructive to humankind: he emphatically but vaguely alludes to danger and does no more than that, assuming or feigning his idea to be self-evidently true. However, it is not so much the logical detail of the personifications in the set-piece's direct case that I want to examine; rather, it is how they construct an indirect case, here less ra tional than emotive, which virtually lays the foundation for an argument to be developed soon after (and briefly anticipated at 1.3.2). At the end of the passage, Hooker asks: "See we not plainly that obedi ence of creatures unto the lawe of nature is the stay of the whole world?" The word "creatures" points primarily to the various physical components of the heavens and of the earth that (as Hooker says) "do all serve" the microcosm "man"; nonetheless, the word necessarily includes "man him selfe," implying that just as merely material creatures obey natural law so</page><page sequence="9">Aspects of Hooker's Rhetoric 185 too should human creatures. In affirming that implicit idea, I suggest, the personifications of the set-piece present its indirect case. Because of Hook er's personifications in the passage, the reader finds himself/herself look ing, so to speak, at not just an animate universe but at one that is for the most part anthropomorphic: he or she looks at an image of the universe in which beings humanized to various degrees are hypothesized as depart ing from?or as affected by others' departing from?natural law, thereby ruining themselves or being ruined. Thus the personifications create something of a mirror effect that seems to invite the reader to learn from the imaginary, disastrous disobedience to natural law of his/her fellow and like "creatures." The personifications do not invoke consideration of what human obedience to natural law is, or of how human obedience to natu ral law differs from that by "creatures" without intellect; in particular, they do not raise the issue of how human obedience to natural law relates to humankind's obeying revealed law. Instead they bypass such relevant con cerns?as they must, for those concerns are not of first importance in the set-piece?to argue primarily through their emotional force, generated by their vivid anthropomorphizings of a single, simple concept. A little later that indirect case (in almost, but not quite, the same terms) is rath er directly presented, Hooker asserting, for example: And the lawe of reason or humaine nature is that which men by discourse of naturall reason have rightly found out themselves to be all for ever bound unto in their actions. Lawes of reason have these markes to be knowne by. Such as keepe them, resemble most lively in their voluntarte actions, that very maner of working which nature her selfe doth necessarily observe in the course of the whole world. The workes of nature are all behoovefull, beauti full, without superfluitie or defect; even so theirs, if they be framed accord ing to that which the law of reason teacheth. . . . Law rationall therefore, which men commonly use to call the law of nature, meaning thereby the law which humaine nature knoweth it selfe in reason universally bound unto.... (I.8.8-9)14 It might be suggested, then, that if Ciceronian precept allows a rhetori cian using the high style to appear overcharged with emotion and oblivi ous of logical niceties, Hooker's prose in the set-piece should be viewed as adroitly in keeping with Ciceronian theory. Certainly Hooker does seem here to be fashioning something akin to the Ciceronian concept of the high style with its legitimized unreason. From this point, however, having suggested how unreason can function in Hooker's set-pieces (and the two examined above would seem important to the main argument of his 14- Cf. 1.5fr. Here one should, I think, also note the similarity of Hooker's thought to Calvin's in relation to notions of the "natural order." See Institutes 1.16.2 (and, with refer ence to the high style, 1.14.21) in Institutes of the Christian Religion, trans. Henry Beveridge, 2 vols. (1845; rPt- Grand Rapids: Wm. B Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1983).</page><page sequence="10">186 Cousins Lawes), I do not wish to consider further passages at equal length. But even to consider them briefly supports and elaborates upon what has so far been proposed, especially with reference to Hooker's defence of natural law. That can be seen in the second book of his work where, with an interest ingly dramatic pragmatographia, Hooker seals his reasoned opposition to the taking of Scripture as life's sole guide. Imagine, he writes, what would happen if God had in fact established Scripture alone for the direction of life?as presbyterians have claimed God did: But admit this, and marke, I beseech you, what would follow. God in deliver ing scripture to his Church should cleane have abrogated amongst them the lawe of nature; which is an infallible knowledge imprinted in the mindes of all the children of men, whereby both generall principles for directing of humaine actions are comprehended, and conclusions derived from them, upon which conclusions groweth in particularitie the choise of good and evill in the daylie affaires of this life. Admit this; and what shall the scripture be but a snare and a torment to weake consciences, filling them with infinite perplexities, scrupulosities, doubts insoluble, and extreme despaires? Not that the scripture it selfe doth cause any such thing (for it tendeth to the cleane contrarie, and the fruit? therof is resolute assurance and certaintie in that it teacheth) but the necessities of this life urging men to do that which the light of nature, common discretion, and judgement of it selfe directeth them unto; on the other side this doctrine teaching them that so to doe were to sinne against their owne so?les, and that they put forth their handes to iniquitie, whatsoever they go about and have not first the sacred scripture of God for direction; howe can it choose but bring the simple a thousand times to their wits ende: how can it choose but vex and amaze them? For in every action of common life to find out some sentence cleerly and infalliblie setting before our eyes what wee ought to do, (seeme wee in scripture never so expert) woulde trouble us more then wee are aware. In weake and tender mindes wee little knowe what myserye this strict opinion woulde breede, besides the stoppes it woulde make in the whole course of all mens lives and actions. Make all thinges sinne which we do by direction of natures light and by the rule of common discretion without thinking at al upon scripture; admit this position, and parentes shall cause their children to sinne, as oft as they cause them to do any thing, before they come to yeares of capacitie and be ripe for knowledge in the scripture. Admit this, and it shall not bee with masters, as it was with him in the Gospell, but servantes being commanded to goe shall stand still, till they have their errand warranted unto them by scripture. Which as it standeth with Christian dutie in some cases, so in common affaires to require it were most unfit. (II.8.6) Hooker argues that accepting revealed but not natural law as a guide to conduct will fragment and paralyze especially the troubled and (or) sim ple personality, so causing social discord. The rhetoric of his argument seems orthodox (definitio, admonitio, contrarium, divisio, and so on, textur ing an Attic plainness) yet his logic seems not to be. Hooker is, of course, elaborating here on his basic principle that the laws of nature and of rev</page><page sequence="11">Aspects of Hooker's Rhetoric 187 elation act in conjunction; however, to show the effects of their divorce upon the individual and society he reasons selectively and posits extremes of behaviour. For example: having declared that the law of nature is pos sessed by the mind innately, but in general terms, Hooker chooses in ef fect to deny that there are lucid, at times concordant, and no less general rules for conduct?as well as many specific injunctions?easily taught and easily assimilable from Scripture. He ignores the relevant and uncomfort able issue of education in scriptural truth. (He has to argue so narrowly because to do otherwise would be to undermine his Thomist scheme of laws, hence the basis of his world view, and to confront his opponents on their own terms). He also refuses to consider that the (unexemplified) promptings of nature could, in the ordinary course of things, be habitu ally and finally judged against scriptural imperatives?a quite familiar notion in the New Testament and one which would accord with his think ing elsewhere in his Lawes. His argument labours awkwardly to displace the weight of Biblical authority. Hooker admits that Scripture offers "res olute assurance and certaintie in that it teacheth," postulates nonetheless that it must be hard to base everyday actions on Scripture, and evades all argumentative difficulties to focus on picturing the notionally "common" person becoming neurotic from the vexations of a Bible-burdened life. Hooker's real intent in the set-piece would seem, then, to be too emphat ically political: he ends a reasoned case with the unreason of his prag matographia so that he can present his emotive, hypothetical and hyper bolic picture of the disturbed "common" person and thus play on his readers' fears of anarchy?that is to say, on his readers' fears of perhaps irremediable social disruption. How important that is to the function of his set-piece can be seen from its close, for Hooker concludes by negat ing a gospel story, illustrative of (among other things) civil obedience. So far I have suggested how in his set-pieces Hooker can diminish rea son and seek domination of his readers through unreason. What remains to be examined within the scope of this discussion is one of those moments when he chooses virtually to conceal reason beneath a weight of emotion. There is a clear instance ofthat in Book Three, occurring where Hooker concentrates on puritan attempts to discredit reason: But so it is, the name of the light of nature is made hatefull with men; the starre of Reason and learning, and all other such like helps beginneth no otherwise to be thought of, then if it were an unluckie Comet, or as if God had so accursed it, that it should never shine or give light in things concern ing our dutie any way towards him, but be esteemed as that starre in the Revelation called woormewood, which beeing fallen from heaven, maketh rivers and waters in which it falleth so bitter, that men tasting them, dye there of. (III.8.4)</page><page sequence="12">i88 Cousins Hooker does not reason about reason but dwells on some of its emotive names, beginning with familiar representations of it. As image follows im age in the demonstratio, Hooker leads the reader from one, that has the authority of being a (reassuring) philosophical commonplace, to another that is impressively dignified and carries a Biblical authority. Hooker then confronts the reader with an alien, apparently incongruous, image of rea son and ends with an image which, (falsely) drawing on Biblical authority to denigrate reason, parodies the puritan fondness for viewing things in terms of the Apocalypse. That aptly final and climactic image indicates how astute Hooker's management of the set-piece has in fact been. Moving from the conventional and logically defensible (but not here defended) to the appropriately Biblical ("appropriately" because the reader rationally per ceives that the Biblical image is relevant, and that the image itself offers a valid analogy) in his representations of reason, Hooker then proceeds to what the reader recognizes to be the excessive as well as irrational?thus moving deftly towards suggesting unreason and idiosyncrasy in the puri tan mind, with its distaste for natural reason. Hooker exposes that mind to elaborate ridicule without himself proffering an overtly and systemati cally reasoned argument about either it or the nature of reason. It could be readily shown that other set-pieces, for instance those on puritan opposition to "Romish ceremonies" (IV.4.3) and on zeal (V.3.3), accord with what has been argued above. Now, however, it might be more useful to suggest what the set-pieces considered above tend to reveal about Hooker's rhetoric in his Lawes as a whole. They imply, for a start, that Hook er's Ciceronianism is more inclusive than has been usually allowed. To be sure, Hooker does write at times in apparently close imitation of the Cice ronian high style, as has been widely observed; on the other hand, at times he also writes in what seems to be close imitation of the Ciceronian plain style. And his Ciceronianism appears to reflect a double, significant affini ty between the two rhetors that has not been noted or examined, namely, as regards their ideologies of the aesthetic, and as regards the rationale of rhetoric itself. Nor has there been focus on Hooker's Ciceronianism as a link between him and those conservative Tudor rhetoricians and political theorists who had previously acknowledged, or were contemporaneously acknowledging, Cicero's preeminent authority as a theorist of the role and contexts of rhetoric. But I would suggest that the set-pieces examined in this discussion imply more important things than those just oudined. Study of them indicates that the conventional view of Hooker as a writer pains takingly conducting a tolerant, rational argument amidst intolerant, un reasonable extremists needs reassessment. Now it is true that his Lawes does painstakingly express tolerance, that his text does have a painstaking rea sonableness?those are aspects of his Lawes that many readers have found</page><page sequence="13">Aspects of Hooker's Rhetoric 189 and continue to find attractive. It is true, too, that he was surrounded by extremists, among whom were some members of his own party. For all that, the major set-pieces studied in this discussion (or merely alluded to) tend to indicate Hooker's willingness to play with reason, to diminish it, to ig nore it, when doing so suited his purpose. They tend to imply how strate gically he could deploy unreason, how subtly (and with what various intol erance) the advocate of reason could exploit emotion at reason's expense in reason's service, while feigning reasonableness. One does not, then, have to query the conventional view of Hooker as being?in his Lawes?reason able as well as tolerant and proceed totally to deny his text those qualities; nor does the conventional view of him demand to be collapsed by some familiar deconstructive manoeuvre that would, ultimately, represent the Lawes as yet another discourse signifying the impossibility of rational dis course. The moments of the Lawes considered in this essay, however, seem unable to be contained by the conventional view of Hooker.15 They tend to indicate that Hooker the defensorfidei was a shrewder, more adroit po lemicist than the greater number of even his admiring critics have conced ed. Those moments of the text do not establish the total unreasonableness of his Lawes; they do not establish his text's intolerance. Nonetheless, they do imply that the notion of Hooker as an icon of reasonableness and tol erance needs revision; they do imply that Hooker, seeking to employ rea son, defend it, and define its scope, could play with and (or) downplay it; and they likewise imply that Hooker's range and inventiveness as a rheto rician have been greatly underestimated. 15. On Hooker's seeking to establish the scope of reason in relation to religion, see Debora Kuller Shuger, Habits of Thought in the English Renaissance (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1990), pp. 17-47. Arthur Pollard, in his Richard Hooker (London: Longman, 1966), remarks that in IV.7.6 "Hooker has, in fact, tried to conduct a sort of verbal sleight-of-hand" (p. 27) ? but he proceeds to describe that as an aberration. Pollard is one of the few critics to have even raised the notion of unreason and deception in Hooker's rhetoric.</page></plain_text>
