Cowper HIS He reflects CLOSE alludes FRIEND on to whether Isaiah's AND fellow evangelical, the poet William Cowper reflects on whether one can recognize the onset of the end-time. He alludes to Isaiah's prophecies concerning the events that precede the last day, which begin, "Behold, the lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhab- itants" (Holy Bible , Isa. 24.1). Remarking on the "singularity of the present season," Cowper wonders how one can distinguish millen- nial presages from meteorological extremes in regular seasonal cy- cles (143).1 Earthquakes had devastated southern Italy in the spring, and in Cowper's Buckinghamshire village of Olney the June weather had taken a turn eerily reminiscent of Isaiah's apocalyptic prophe- cies. "The inhabitants of the earth are burned," foretells Isaiah (24.6); "the fogs," Cowper writes, "continue, though 'till yesterday the Earth was as dry as intense Heat could make it." "The moon shall be con- founded, and the sun ashamed," according to the prophet (24.23); in Olney, the sun rises and sets "without his rays, and hardly shines at noon even in a cloudless sky," and the moon is "the colour of heated brick," an effect of a "misty atmosphere" unlike any in "re- membrance." Calling his perspective "perfectly Scriptural," Cow- per decides that, while "some will look for" Judgment Day "at one period and some at another," there is no point in seeking signs of its imminence. There will be no meteorological premonitions, be- cause the Last Judgment constitutes a total interruption of nature's [ © 2012 BY THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA j 477</page><page sequence="2">478 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A spatiotemporal continuity, an apocalyptic un- veiling recognizable only on "the day itself." Over the next year, as Cowper composed his great poem, the six-book georgic The Task (1785), he continued to ask what the weather, a summer of scorching heat and noxious haze followed by the coldest winter in memory, might reveal about an uncertain present. As he wrote his poem of "modern times," what troubled Cowper was not the inevitable ap- proach of the end, which he expected any day, but the possibility that the means of keeping time, of recognizing what endures and what gives way, were being lost ( Task 178n). Cow- per was writing in the late eighteenth century, at the beginning of a modernization process defined by the industrial combustion of fossil fuels. But The Task , I suggest, is marked by the uncertainties and anxieties of a modern climate. Frank Kermode, in his 1967 study of eschatology as narrative form, observes that the Greeks distinguished between chronos , times steady succession, and kairos , "the sea- son, a point in time filled with significance, charged with a meaning derived from its rela- tion to the end" (47). Like the French temps , kairos refers to time and weather, indexing an etymological connection between temporal perception and meteorological periodicity. In modernity, according to Kermode, "perpetual crisis," reckoned in chronological time, sup- plants both the punctuations of kairos and an "apocalypticism" that anticipates the end as an "imminent historical event" (27-28). In a year of atmospheric disturbance, in an age of temporal acceleration, Cowper grappled with the insufficiency of chronos as a measure of crisis, as a means of apprehending the unique critical conditions of the present. The Present Climate The defining global condition of the twenty- first century will be the ecological, economic, and demographic disruption caused by an- thropogenic climate change. There is now sci- entific consensus that human-forced warming is transforming the earths geophysical and biological systems at a speed and to a degree with only a few cataclysmic precedents in the geologic record. Experts describe the dire con- sequences of climate change, some of which have begun to occur: a global temperature rise of 1.1-6.4 degrees Celsius during this century ("IPCC"), biodiversity loss and potential eco- system collapse, déglaciation and rising sea levels, widespread population displacement, and ever-more-extreme weather. The gravest concern is that we are approaching or have already passed a climatic (if not climactic) tipping point, where abrupt and irreversible feedback loops- related to the carbon cycle, methane release, and ice albedo - precipitate runaway global warming. Today it is scien- tists, not prophets, who speak the language of apocalypse. James Hansen, the climatolo- gist who heads NASAs Goddard Institute, foresees "a chaotic transition period" that will begin with the disintegration of the polar ice sheets, leading to unprecedented "social and economic devastation" (250, 257). Meanwhile, the public and its political representatives in the United States and much of the world respond with near indifference. In January 2010, following the hottest de- cade on record, a Pew Research Center poll found that climate change ranked last among twenty-one national priorities ("Public s Pri- orities"). The climate catastrophe- a violent alteration in the physical order of nature, a conclusive downward turn - is in some cru- cial way illegible, recalcitrant to representa- tion, a "problematic object of perception" in the words of Gillen D'Arcy Wood (32). In The End of Nature (1990), the first signifi- cant book to alert the American public to the threat of global warming, Bill McKibben at- tributes our incapacity to recognize the deter- mining condition of our present to defective timekeeping. "We tell time badly," he writes (xv). More recently, Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued that anthropogenic climate change</page><page sequence="3">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 479 eludes our capacity for historical narrativ- ization. The fact that "humans now wield a geological force" on a global scale throws our "usual historical practices for visualizing times, past and future . . . into a deep con- tradiction and confusion" (206). Similarly, in Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor &gt; Rob Nixon describes the "represen- tational challenges posed" by a "violence that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space," of which global warming provides a definitive instance (2). Extending these analyses of the represen- tational intractability of climatic temporality, this essay focuses on periodicity, a word (like revolution) bound up with the enigmatic dia- lectics of duration and completion, repetition and rupture, that underlie our perception of time. Periodicity refers both to recurrent tem- poral cycles and to diachronically organized historical eras. In a 2002 paper published in Nature , the chemist Paul Crutzen identi- fied a new period in the history of the earth, the Anthropocene. He dates this "human- dominated, geological epoch" to the "latter part of the eighteenth century, when analy- ses of air trapped in polar ice showed the be- ginning of growing global concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane. This date also happens to coincide with James Watt's design of the steam engine in 1784."2 It also matches, with eerie precision, the year in which Cow- per composed The Task. The Anthropocene, my reading of The Task will suggest, is the pe- riod in which the human capacity to radically transform geologic and climatic processes al- ters the conditions of periodicity itself. The idea of the Anthropocene poses several challenges for cultural historians and critics. It requires us to reshuffle long- standing periodizations, to distinguish between the culture of the Holocene, the twelve-thousand-year era of relative climatic stability in which human civilization devel- oped, and the culture of the Anthropocene.3 Moreover, it is difficult for humanists and scientists alike to recognize a "geological modernity" because, as Bruno Latour ar- gues, modern disciplines are founded on the conceptual separation of human acts from natural facts. By distinguishing "signs [from] things," post-Enlightenment thought enables us to tell the time of the present, the distance between the "obscurity of the olden days, which illegitimately blended together social needs and natural reality" and the "luminous dawn" of a modernity "that cleanly separate [s] material causality from human fantasy" (35). The separation Latour defines has the para- doxical effect of proliferating the hybrid en- tities that modern thought is constitutively unequipped to analyze, disturbing the mod- ern idea of steady "time that passes" with "a turbulent flow of whirlpools and rapids" (68, 73). Anthropogenic climate change is a para- digmatic hybrid phenomenon, a human arti- fact studied by scientists as if it were a natural object. Human beings have become geologic agents - collectively, a "natural condition" on a planetary scale (Chakrabarty 214) - and to recognize our role in the changing climate would be to see a human imprint where we have been taught, since the Enlightenment, not to look: in the weather. Modernity holds weather and history apart, measuring both in an abstract and linear temporality. Analyzing the turbulence of modern time- and its me- teorological equivalent: urban hazes and toxic sunsets, epochal storms and decade-long draughts- requires a historiography attentive not only to the interdependence of "meanings and mechanisms" but also to time s variabil- ity, as it is structured by material conditions and discursively mediated (Latour 35). It was Walter Benjamin, still the indis- pensable theorist of modern temporal me- diation, who first diagnosed modernity's telling incapacity to measure its own time. In an era of temporal acceleration, social frag- mentation, and shortened cycles of aware- ness, historical flux comes to be apprehended</page><page sequence="4">480 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A primarily in the perceptual disturbance Ben- jamin termed "shock." Benjamin analyzed a modernity embodied in Paris's glass-roofed shopping galleries, which replaced unpre- dictable weather with panoramic paintings of natural scenery.4 This essay, inspired by Ben- jamin s reading of "bad weather" in Baude- laire's lyrics, emphasizes "the differentials of time" that Benjamin claims are the condition of any materialist historical "reckoning" ( Ar- cades Project 111, 456). Rejecting a positiv- isti historiography that characterizes time as a continuous and uniform flow (chronos), Benjamin argues that our experience of time is variably structured and that temporal re- flexivity emerges at the intersection of hetero- geneous temporal modes- often, it turns out, the intersection between weather and history. And yet, as I suggest in my conclusion, Ben- jamin nostalgically holds onto the promise of climatic continuity as a condition of histori- cal self-awareness. In "The End of Temporality," Fredric Jameson follows Benjamin by contending that temporal self-reflexivity, the hallmark of mod- ernist aesthetics he calls "sensitivity to deep time," reflects a "comparativist perception" of contrasting rural and urban "socioeconomic temporalities" (699). Unlike the modern- ist writers who lived in London but retained experience of seasonal rhythms and dilatory rural time, Cowper, writing in the 1780s, witnessed the incipient stages of moderniza- tion - mercantile imperialism, urbanization, enclosure, and industrialization - from the village of Olney. Like the modernists, Cow- per, who in a letter to Newton deemed himself an "(Economist of time" (10 Nov. 1783 [186]), was profoundly alert to variable speeds, du- rations, and time scales, as well as to what Mary Favret calls "time's utterance," the per- ceptual and representational measures that make time articulate (53). In recent books, both Favret and Kevis Goodman have revital- ized our understanding of The Task as a poem preoccupied with temporal mediation and with the particular challenge of knowing and representing the historical present.5 Build- ing on their insights, I suggest that Cowper understood "modern times" as a structure of temporal consciousness characterized by the intensification of present awareness and short- term expectation. In The Task , he contrasts the temporal disorders of the modern impe- rial metropole with several modes of meteoro- logical time: cumulative experience in a stable English climate, the georgic synchronization of human cultivation with recurrent seasonal cycles, and a providential or prophetic herme- neutics that looks to the atmosphere for signs of divine judgment. Yet Cowper is unable to escape modernity's temporal disorientation. The heat and sulfuric haze Cowper describes in his June 1783 reflections on eschatology, we now know, had a natural cause, the massive eruption of the Icelandic volcano Laki. As he composed The Task , however, Cowper came to regard the atmospheric turmoil as a symptom of modern time. Immersed in the haze, the meteorological countermeasures with which he sought to record the passing historical mo- ment themselves seemed occluded, as if the calendar were changing according to a hid- den logic. The Laki Haze Much is revealed about the ascendance of em- pirical meteorology when a poet as saturnine as Cowper, writing to his most devout friend, reacted to the biblical weather of June 1783 by designating himself "a great Observer of nat- ural appearances, but . . . not a superstitious one" ("To John Newton," 13 June 1783 [143]). Reporting on the toxic haze, violent storms, and deafening fireballs, Cowper distinguishes between natural time and messianic time, the book of nature and the fate of man; he does not read "Scripture by the contingencies of the day." He defends his weather reportage in En- lightenment terms: "Misty however as I am, I do not mean to be Mystical , but to be un-</page><page sequence="5">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 481 derstood like an Almanac maker" (144). The almanac, as Jan Golinski explains, had un- dergone a significant redefinition in the eigh- teenth century, as astrological prediction gave way to daily record keeping. The new alma- nacs bound the contingency of unpredictable atmospheric events to the sequential forward movement of the "civic calendar" (101-04). Weather became a "quotidian occurrence," rather than a singular event (a "meteor"), when inscribed in the chronological time of the almanac, newspaper, calendar, and clock (78). The analogical worldview gave way, the sky was emptied of portent, and the weather, silenced and secularized, came to mark time's movement in its most prosaic register. Reject- ing an anthropomorphic meteorology that would see in strange weather a presage of his- torical eventfulness, Cowper claims that even the most unusual atmospheric phenomena fall within the general uniformity of nature. Yet, having adopted an Enlightenment under- standing of meteorological time, Cowper does not altogether eschew the possibility that the singular weather tells a different story: "As a poet nevertheless I claim, if any wonderfull event should follow, a right to apply [it] ... to the purposes of the tragic Muse" (144). Unbeknownst to Cowper, a sixteen-mile volcanic fissure in southern Iceland opened on 8 June 1783. Laki was the most powerful and devastating volcanic eruption between Huaynaputina in 1600 and Tambora in 1815. During its early eruptions it produced as much sulfur dioxide in two days as European industry does now in one year ("Summer"). Observers reported the progress of the toxic cloud as it drifted over Scandinavia, France, and Britain, triggering a "range of extreme atmospheric, meteorological, and environ- mental phenomena" (Grattan and Brayshay 126). The accumulation of sulfur dioxide in the lower atmosphere amplified the natural greenhouse effect, leading to the hottest sum- mer recorded in England until 1995 ("Sum- mer"). Extreme summer heat, along with the miasma of poisonous gas, aerosol, and ash, amplified the typical mortality rate by forty percent (Witham and Oppenheimer 18). La- borers died during the harvest, as Cowper noted in a 7 September 1783 letter to William Unwin (157). As the volcanic gases accumu- lated in the upper atmosphere, they deflected solar energy back into space, causing global cooling (much as they did following Mount Pinatubo s eruption in 1991) and leading to a severe winter and another mortality peak. The average temperature in 1784 in Europe was two degrees Celsius below the norm, and global weather patterns remained abnormal for years, causing famines in France, Egypt, Japan, and Alaska. Over the following decade, naturalists correctly correlated the meteorological dis- turbance with Laki s eruption. In 1784 Benja- min Franklin, ambassador to France, linked the "universal fog" of 1783 with "the vast quantity of smoke, long continuing to issue during the summer from Hecla," a volcano near Laki, "which might be spread by various winds, over the northern part of the world." Immersed in the thick haze, though, even as empirical an observer as the Selborne natu- ralist Gilbert White found himself wondering what the remarkable atmospheric phenomena might portend. "The country people began to look with a superstitious awe at the red, lour- ing aspect of the sun," he wrote to Daines Barrington, "and indeed there was reason for the most enlightened person to be apprehen- sive" (247-48; see also Peterfreund). Though 1783 was an eventful year- Britain recog- nized American independence, the first hot air balloon rose over France - it was not an obvious candidate for apocalypse. Observers did not look to the skies expecting portent; rather, the ominous weather made them re- consider the present. As Cowper explained to Newton on 29 June, the sun rising and setting with "the face of a red hot salamander," the weather had precipitated anxious "specula- tion among the Connoscenti" (148-49). Some</page><page sequence="6">482 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A wondered if the earth s orbit had tilted, a sure sign of "the last times." Although no miraculous event oc- curred, Cowpers tragic muse was awakened. In the 29 June letter to Newton, he associ- ates his own surprising "Sally of Genius," a witty rhyme at the start of the letter, with the "Boeotian atmosphere" - Bœotia being a region in central Greece known for its fogs (148). Invoking the initial description in Para- dise Lost of Lucifer s sublime obscurity, which echoed in the minds of many of his contem- poraries that June, he writes, "We never see the sun but shorn of his beams."6 In this in- spired, agitated state, Cowper began writing The Task. He first discusses the poem in his correspondence as it neared completion dur- ing the freezing winter of 1783-84. Writing to William Bull on 22 February 1784, he reports the end of the long frost: "The Ice in my Ink however is not yet dissolved. It was long be- fore the frost seized it but at last it prevailed. The Sofa," as the poem was originally titled, "has consequently received little or no addi- tion since" (217). Composed over the course of a year in which none of the seasons seemed as they should, in which time had lost its most reliable measure, The Task is a sustained re- flection on the obscurity of the present. Signs of the Times Early in the awful summer of 1783, Lady Austen suggested that Cowper, who had seen his first public success with his 1782 volume of moral satires, divert himself by writing a poem on the subject of the sofa. Cowper ac- knowledged the arbitrariness of his choice to "sing the Sofa," but what is clear from The Task's opening is that the theme of the domestic interior initially served Cowper's intention to reflect critically on the state of English society without the sententiousness of his previous volume (1.1). It is in the sit- ting room, after all, that he read both the "the historians page" (4.158) and the newspaper, which, by bringing "intelligence [from] ev'ry clime," provided "a map of busy life, / Its fluc- tuations, and its vast concerns" (111, 55-56). The furniture that is the setting of historical inquiry, Cowper decides, may also be its ob- ject. The Task commences with a "historical deduction of seats," in which trade and labor contribute to the invention of the sofa. The bathos of the sofa as a synecdoche for "the manners and arts of civil life," however, sug- gests that history's tendency is not unequivo- cally progressive (1.595). Advancement and decline are inseparable, for Cowper uncovers in the sofa not only the comforts of home but also the ills of the present: imperial war, fash- ionable consumption, even deforestation. Genteel repose offers an unsatisfactory posture for a poet who aspires to rouse his urbane readers by "speak[ing] to purpose" (4.25). To judge the present requires an un- timely voice, an alternative vantage. Seeking an understanding of the present beyond that available in the nightly reading of the news- paper, the poet heads outdoors. "For I have lov'd the rural walk" (1.109), he explains, and here the eddying temporality of the present perfect, the tense in which the past cumulates in the present, establishes the poem's spatio- temporal distinction between the accretion of experience in natural cycles and the dizzy- ing motion of historical succession. The once again of a return that measures change, which Wordsworth learned from Cowper, reflects the periodic temporality of a stable climate: a klima , or inclination, of the earth, of a region and its prevailing weather. Rural scenes and cycling seasons sustain a continuous cadence in a world of individual and social senescence. Recurrence- paths and prospects revisited, the daily and seasonal round - is perceived as renewal because "long experience" (Benja- min's Erfahrung) accumulates unconsciously: "we have borne / The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew" (147, 155-56). Cowper is drawing on the Hippocratic model, revital- ized in the Enlightenment, which emphasizes</page><page sequence="7">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 483 the long-term, subconscious influence of cli- mate, an influence that is, in Cowpers view, as much calendrical as cultural. Climate, as Serres writes, is "the inclination from which the time of order is born" ( Genesis 102). A careful "Observer of natural appear- ances" who flirts with natural theology and amateur natural history, Cowper describes a dynamic system he calls, adopting the term popularized by Linnaeus, an "economy" (6.579). His conception of nature s economy is essentially climatic, stressing not stasis but a stability that prevails within fluctuation, cy- cles that recur amid variation, global systems with local permutations. This economy is de- fined by the periodic motion of the earth s rotation and its orbit around the sun, by the hydrologie cycle, and by the passage of winds and vapors: "By ceaseless action all that is subsists. / Constant rotation of th unwearied wheel / That nature rides upon maintains her health, / Her beauty, her fertility" (367-70). Cowper is describing a global circuit - "Winds from all quarters agitate the air" (373) - but its perceptible manifestation is decidedly re- gional. The locodescriptive account of Olney, its natural cycles generating a tempo of rec- ollection and return, is followed, in book 1, by scenes of displacement across an "earth ... so various" (506): the mariner longing for home, the widow whose fancy follows her lost sailor "to distant shores" (540), the displaced Tahitian Ornai. In contrast with these dislo- cated imperial subjects, only one who remains "still" in place (143) recognizes the "revol- vency" that "upholds the world" (372). As Favret notes, stillness has a "peculiar charge" in The Task , as a state of "hesitation" encom- passing "ongoingness" and completion (106). Cowper understands the cumulative, what is still, as the condition for registering change, what is new. It is neither his knowledge of his- torical events nor an all-encompassing pros- pect that offers a critical vantage on "modern times" but rather sustained, subconscious ex- perience of a settled English clime. Though its title, "The Time-Piece," sug- gests the regularized measure of time pass- ing, book 2 opens with the poet's seeking to elude the demands that historical awareness places on his moral sensibility by retiring to a "lodge in some vast wilderness / Some boundless contiguity of shade" (1-2). What interrupts the rhythm of rural time, however, is not the news from a "noisy world" (4.5) but rather bad weather: "Fires from beneath, and meteors from above, / Portentous, unexam- pled, unexplaind, / Have kindled beacons in the skies" (2.57-59). The time of weather has become meteoric, in the early modern sense of the "unstable, unpredictable, aleatory, tur- bulent, disruptive, and chaotic" atmospheric event (Reed 9). Cowper recounts the awful harbingers and natural calamities of recent years: a massive hurricane and tidal wave in Jamaica, the earthquakes in Calabria, violent thunderstorms, and the inexplicable, inter- minable toxic fog. "The Time-Piece," Cow- per later explains to Newton, "is intended to strike the hour that gives notice of approach- ing judgment, . . . dealing pretty largely with the signs of the times " (11 Dec. 1784 [309]). The natural-historical scrutiny of Cowper s initial reports on the Laki haze has been sup- planted by a thoroughly "mystical" meteo- rology. Although "prophecy" may require a "longer respite," deferring the "end" augured by these "frowning signals," here it is not cli- matic regularity but its rupture that sustains moral-social critique (65-68). The poet gains his authority to judge modern times not as one who has experienced the comprehensive workings of general providence but as one who recognizes special providence, interpret- ing the "voice" that speaks in atmospheric violence (52). Correlating the apocalyptic weather with urbanization, the slave trade, and imperial warfare, Cowper contends that a wrathful God "involves the heavn / In tempests, quits his grasp upon the winds / And gives them all their fury" (2.180-82). In "The Time-Piece," Enlightenment natural</page><page sequence="8">484 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A philosophy gives way to the doctrine Vladi- mir Jankovic refers to as "Divine steering," according to which God acts as a "moral coordinator," maintaining a " causal link be- tween nature and human affairs" (56). Cowper initially interpreted the Laki haze as a contingent meteorological event in the uniform flow of seasonal time, and then, in "The Time-Piece," he identifies it as a portent of Judgment Day, when God arrests natures recurrent temporality. In these two interpretive modes, which would seem to dis- tinguish primitive from modern knowledge, the weather is understood as constituting a time and measuring an agency distinct from human action. But what seems truly discon- certing to Cowper is the possibility that the haze may be related to the modernizing pro- cesses that are obscuring meteorological signs and times. This concern is anticipated in the 29 June letter to Newton. In rejecting a mil- lennial understanding of the sulfuric fog - what he calls "the present obfuscation" - he asks how "signs in the heavens" could predict the end-time when Londoners, enveloped in a "dingy atmosphere" caused by burning coal, would be unlikely to notice (149). The city, he observes, generates its own smoggy weather, a secularized atmosphere devoid of divine sig- natures. London keeps its own time. The two-line description of the Laki haze in "The Time-Piece"- "Nature with a dim and sickly eye / [seems] to wait the close of all" (64-65)- is so peculiar that Cowper added a footnote clarifying that it refers "to the fog that covered both Europe and Asia during the summer of 1783" (86n). The per- sonification is confusing because it designates not the occluding agent but what has been oc- cluded, the sun, which is presented, paradoxi- cally, as both an instrument of vision and a source of illumination. The sun is imbued with what Benjamin calls aura: "To perceive the aura of an object we look at means to in- vest it with the ability to look back at us. This experience corresponds to the data of the mé- moire involontaire y ("On Some Motifs" 338)7 If "long experience" reflects the role a given climates diurnal and seasonal cycles play as a subconscious calendar, the haze interposes between self and sky, which no longer serves as a container for memory. This waning of at- mospheric aura, a sky that has lost its period- icity, will be linked to the crisis in perception that defines modern time. The ontic status of the haze is indeterminate: as sign or context, physical or cognitive condition, natural, di- vine, or human artifact. The haze is a visible manifestation of obscuration, what Good- man calls a figure of "expressive inarticulate- ness" (97), and while it interrupts the rhythm of time it also alerts the poet to the problem of the present, which is why he clarifies its standing as a historic event. What must have been most distressing about the Laki haze was how physically remi- niscent it was of the everyday atmosphere of London: a noxious mix of ash, sulfur dioxide, and other gases. The "wholesome airs" of the Buckinghamshire countryside were replaced with "smoke . . . the eclipse / That Metropoli- tan volcanos make, / Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long" (3.732-38). Serendipitously figuring smokestacks as vol- canoes, Cowper aligns the infernal Laki haze with Londons perpetual smog, the result of the burning of highly sulfurous seacoal. In The Botanic Garden (1790), Erasmus Darwin made the same connection: "The dry mist of summer 1783 . . . was probably occasioned by volcanic eruption . . . and therefore more like the atmosphere of smoke which hangs on still days over great cities" (71n). In The Task , Cowper draws attention to London s noisome atmosphere, its worsening industrial pollu- tion, the "smoke of lamps," and "the pent-up breath of an unsavry throng" (4.195-96). "All for smoke," he writes, dismissing modern industriousness and ingenuity (3.174). The city is plagued not only by haze and miasma but also by an artificially bright ambiance, lighting that upsets circadian rhythms and</page><page sequence="9">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 485 obscures the sky. In the brown study scene, fa- mous for having influenced Coleridge, the re- fulgent urban atmosphere is contrasted with "slow-moving" natural twilight and diurnal repetition, the gentle approach of evening that encourages untimely ruminations (4.243-66). London's obscuring smog and bright lights intensify awareness of a fleeting pres- ent, which becomes more consuming as it becomes less knowable. Unhitched from the earth's steady "revolvency," modern time moves so quickly and is perceived so acutely that those who live in the city "know no pause" (4.283). Time passes without accu- mulating in memory. Cowper worries that the time of the beau monde- the annual mi- gration to London, "time in masquerade," he calls it (4.213)- has displaced seasonal time.8 Fashions, which "change with ev'ry moon," provide an example of time unnaturally quickened and therefore incapable of ripen- ing in experience (2.599). For the shopper who lives à la mode, "constant revolution" fails to bring satisfaction because the spell of "fancy" remains tilted toward the imme- diate future (1.462). Newness is experienced as enervating repetition. The gambler exem- plifies this mode of life lived in a present so demanding that all times beyond the coming instant disappear.9 The "hour-glass" is trans- formed into "a dice-box," a speculative tem- porality defined by unceasing anticipation of what is about to occur (4.220-21). As readers have long noticed, The Task is unable to sustain its symbolic moral topog- raphy- "God made the country, and man made the town" (1.749)- because the languid, cumulative, and periodic temporalities of ru- ral life are being subsumed within modern time. "The town has ting'd the country" as "fashion runs / Down into scenes still rural" (4.553-56). Viewed according to picturesque principles, estates become "landscapes," sub- ject to altering acts of "Improvement" (3.755- 64). Without considering seasonal patterns, the landscape architect Lancelot "Capability" Brown refashions the English countryside as swiftly as the earthquakes upended Calabria: "The lake in front becomes a lawn; / Woods vanish, hills subside, and vallies rise" (774- 75). The loss of forest shade is, for Cowper, the starkest example of this remaking of ru- ral time and clime. In his initial account of country rambles, in lines composed during the hottest summer in memory, he describes the relief of entering the "cooler clime" of a leafy forest- like the dusk-lit parlor, a recess in which time eddies, duration expands, and consciousness is emancipated from the de- manding present (1.335-37). Yet shade has grown "obsolete" (265). While previous gener- ations "knew the value of a screen / From sul- try suns" (255-56), changing fashions and the short-term calculations of absentee landown- ers, who sell timber to pay gambling debts (3.752-63), have contributed to Englands de- forestation. Cowper celebrates the decision of the local squire, John Throckmorton, to leave uncut a chestnut grove on his estate at Weston Underwood, yet it is the poets elegy for lost shade and lost time - "Ye fallen avenues! Once more I mourn / Your fate unmerited" (1.338- 39)- that registered so acutely with nostalgic nineteenth-century readers.10 When Cowper, acknowledging his debt to Vergil, the "Mantuan bard" (453), turns to the art of cultivating cucumbers in book 3, "The Garden," he aims to define a rhythm of human action harmonized with natural cycles, the "employs of rural life, / Reiterated as the wheel of time / Runs round" (625-27). As James Thomson demonstrated with his immensely popular poem The Seasons (1726- 46), the georgic, with its metaphorics of cul- ture as tending and its attribution of semiotic legibility to natural phenomena, is the proper mode in which to treat the cultivation of temporal synchronization. In its eighteenth- century heyday, the georgic promised to bridge modernity's epistemic rift between human conventions and natural objects, the time of history and of weather. As in Vergil's</page><page sequence="10">486 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A Georgics , which offers a key to those atmo- spheric "signs" that "presage / Of heats and rains, and winds impetuous rage" (1.483-84), in "The Garden" Cowper teaches his readers to slow down and attend to meteorological and horticultural signs. Time slackens as Cowper narrates the process of cultivating cucumbers, an art ac- quired through "Experience, slow precep- tress" (3.505). The gardener must yield to the tempo of the garden, patiently accepting a "discreet delay" in order to catch "[^h* aus- picious moment" when "time subdues / The rage of fermentation" (504-19). Here Cow- per s narration becomes self-reflexive.11 Even so prolix a mode as a georgic composed in blank verse, he worries, is insufficient to nar- rate the pace of gardening and would try the patience of modern readers. If his account of cultivating cucumbers fails to accord with the time and temperature of his readers, they will "judge the song / Cold as its theme" (563-64). Yet if Cowpers contemporaries inhabit the accelerated temporality of an overheated at- mosphere, so does the hothouse gardener. He builds a cold frame, "overlaid with clear translucent glass," which keeps the rain out and the warmth in, allowing a pile of manure to ferment (485). Here, in this greenhouse atmosphere, a surprising vapor and familiar simile enter the poem: "behold! / A pestilent and most corrosive steam, / Like a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast, I ... I Asks egress" (493- 99). The only other use of this stock figure re- corded in Cowper s correspondence or verse is the description in his 29 June letter to New- ton of the toxic Laki haze - which, like a cold frame, intensified heat and which, like the fermenting compost, was noxious to plants. Although "fog Boeotian" refers to "smoking manure," the figurative migration is reveal- ing, for, throughout the poem, haze appears at moments of temporal opacity. The influx of a "vapour dank," figured in the same terms as the portentous summer haze, indexes the disordered time of the greenhouse. Although Cowper associates horticulture with the perceptual slow time of seasonal peri- odicity, the reappearance of the haze suggests that there is a point at which cultivation, the "Assistant art" to "natures office" (3.541-42), becomes history and the timeless becomes irrevocably new. Cucumber gardening, after all, is a recent innovation, "an art / That toil- ing ages have but just maturd" (449-50). The hothouse enables the gardener to escape the capriciousness of spring in a "clime so rude" as Englands, producing artificial and per- haps ill-begotten blooms: "hence evn winter fills his wither d hand / With blushing fruits, and plenty, not his own" (427-31). The dream image of the greenhouse, which collects the worlds floral plenitude in its imperial grasp, is of a cornucopia unhitched from seasonal cy- cles and climatic variability, lhe greenhouse offers an ultimately unsatisfactory site for the georgic task of harmonizing human acts with seasonal recurrence, for its climate is exotic, inundated by the fog of history.12 Apocalypse Now The final three of The Task's six books - largely composed between December and March of the frigid Laki winter, which, Cow- per reported to Newton, saw "a frost of nine weeks' continuance" (22 Feb. 1784 [214]) - narrate the condensed span of a single eve- ning and morning. Time pools up, as the poet seeks the still clarity of an ending. The mo- ment is given palpable duration by a winter storm, first recognized by the poet in book 4 when he closed the shutters before reading the news. The scene that follows perfectly stages Cowpers experience, both bewilder- ing and illuminating, of inhabiting a pres- ent riven among contending temporalities. The newspaper promises "intelligence [from] ev ry clime" (111), access to the synchronic social simultaneity of a present projected onto global space. The paper s temporality is one of anticipation, for "who can say / What</page><page sequence="11">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 487 are its tidings?" (24-25), and addiction, mo- dernity's obsession with its present: "I long to know them all" (33). What keeps Cowper in place, "still at home," is the regularity (if unusual frigidity) of "Winter" (119), a percep- tion of the stable climate that underlies the vicissitudes of a season. As he scans the cata- strophic news - falling stocks, battles lost, the exploits of empire (16-30) - he also tracks the blizzard, its "sleet like ashes" (121). In this fluctuating temporal weave, he remembers his own intention not only to record the digres- sions of a "wand ring muse" (3.692) but also to narrativize, and thus make knowable, the present: "Roving as I rove, / Where shall I find an end?" (4.232-33). Cowper hesitates, safely ensconced beside the fire, his fancy freed in the "slow moving" twilight, before being re- vived, his question apparently answered, by the storms "freezing blast" rattling the shut- ters (303).13 The events of distant climes dis- sipate as the snow accumulates, for it is in the weather of a recognizable season that tomor- row (and thus today) may be known: To-morrow brings a change, a total change! Which even now, though silently perform' d And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face Of universal nature undergoes. Fast falls a fleecy show'r. (322-26) The snowstorm measures time silently but surely, its incessant drift clarifying by obscur- ing - "Assimilating] all objects" - a world of human acts and artifacts (329). The promise of clarity is short-lived. To- morrow does arrive, and the present remains hazy. The reassurance of climatic periodicity as countermeasure gives way to unsettling modern weather. In book 5, "The Winter Morning Walk," the poet wakes to the sun rising on the wintry scene, and "the clouds / That crowd away before the driving wind, / More ardent as the disk emerges more, / Re- semble most some city in a blaze" (2-5). The clouds are like an urban crowd and the sky a burning city. Obscuring resemblance sup- plants the clarity of juxtaposition. As the poet walks through the snow-covered landscape, a frozen waterfall reminds him of the notori- ous ice palace built in Saint Petersburg for the Empress Anna Ivanovna. While the palace exemplifies the correlation between climatic and political extremism explored by Mon- tesquieu, Cowper emphasizes not environ- mental determinism but the artificial time of tyrannical rule: "'Twas transient in its nature, as in show / 'Twas durable" (173-74). More unsettlingly, the absolutism of "barb'rous climes," like the blossoms of equatorial flora, is coming to England (1.604). In Cowper s Whiggish ruminations on sovereignty, cli- mate change indexes the anxieties of imperial expansion.14 Cowper sees the development of English liberty as recompense for an intem- perate climate, preferring freedom in a "fickle clime" to arbitrary governance in a temperate region (4.484). Yet, as he reflects on increas- ing faction, corruption, and absolutism, he admits that under a tyrannous English crown he would prefer to live "under skies / Milder" (487-91). As his jeremiad heats up, the me- teorological tropology of the Laki summer is applied to a nation in decline. The haze re- appears as a figure for kingcraft: "They semi- deify and fume him so / That in due season he forgets" he is a man (266-67). Partisanship produces "factious fumes," and irreligion is the "eclipse that intercepts truth s heavenly beam" (513, 683). The storm of history causes the "tempest-beaten turrets [to] shake" on the "old castle of the state" (525-27). The English climate is infused by history. The snowstorm and "morning sharp and clear" are followed by May-like warmth at noon, a return to times reassuring periodicity after the unprecedented Laki winter. Book 6 begins with Cowpers observing signs of sea- sonal change, bleating lambs and budding primroses, which "[d]eceive no student" (114). These auguries of spring reveal the "powr di- vine" evident in the "constancy of nature s course," the providential consistency of the</page><page sequence="12">488 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ PMLA English climate (119-24). Yet the restoration of spring, "the renovation of a faded world" (124), also anticipates the Resurrection: "from death to life, / Is Natures progress when she lectures man / In heav'nly truth" (181-83). This narrative contradiction- spring's return affirms both a cyclical and an eschatological conception of time- encapsulates the herme- neutic problem that haunts Cowpers weather reports. If every atmospheric occurrence is a miracle, the "regular return of genial months" no less than the "punctual sun" frozen at Gibeon (123, 125-27), then there is no way of interpreting the specific implications of the Laki haze. Everywhere Cowper looks - the English state; its capital, London; its growing empire; his own garden and native country- side - he discovers a smoggy intermingling of human affairs and atmospheric phenom- ena. Ascribing this murky atmosphere to "a present God" (252) does nothing to dispel it, for what is illuminated by providential meteorology is the opacity of natural signs, the "veil [that] / Hangs over mortal eyes" (3.233-34). Turning from almanac maker to mystic, from natural history to the designs of an inscrutable God, Cowper finds himself no closer to understanding the sky's "frowning signals." In a world in which human acts and meteorological facts are indistinguishable, in which an urban haze obscures divine portent, providential explanations fail to clear the fog of the present. If rural time and modern time, the gar- den and empire, the skies and the state are inseparably mixed, the poet must reclaim a more absolute temporal measure. Cowper assumes the prophetic voice and invokes the clarity of the end. Instead of prognosticating the future by casting his gaze on the present, the prophet identifies himself as the medium by which the illumination of futurity, "a flash from heav'n," casts its backward glow (5.884). Invoking the apocalyptic tradition, Cowper speaks of the promise of time's legibility, "that blest moment [when] Nature throwing wide / Her veil opaque, discloses with a smile / The author of her beauties" (891-93). Like Milton and Thomson, when Cowper accepts the bur- den of prophecy what he envisages is not the cataclysmic transition described by Isaiah or John but the timeless world to come without tempests, where people "from ev'ry clime" congregate in a sacred city under cloudless skies (6.814). But for the absence of smog, however, this reparative end of time is indis- tinguishable from Cowper's own time. As in the greenhouse, climatic variation disappears, "Rivers of gladness water all the earth, / And clothe all climes with beauty" (763-64), and the yearly cycle is suspended, "The various seasons woven into one, / And that one sea- son an eternal spring" (769-70). This ancient fantasy of a renovated world is what empire offers as its Utopian end of history: weather managed and climate overcome. In the final stanzas of The Task , Cow- per turns from his readers to address God directly. Plaintive apostrophe replaces pro- phetic meteorology, as if the poet's own power to speak is all that remains secure in a foggy world. He calls on the seasons to accelerate, "Haste, then, and wheel away a shatter'd world, / Ye slow-revolving seasons!" (6.823-24), and then speaks to God: "The very spirit of the world is tir'd / Of its own taunt- ing question, ask'd so long, / 'Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?"' (869-71). Cowper is left waiting, wondering about the weather, and hearing only his own voice. In the final stanza, he reflects on his distance from "the haughty world": "Perhaps she owes / Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring / And plenteous harvest, to the pray'r [the poet] makes" (945-47). As the poem ends, Cowper is more confident about his capacity to influence the seasons, entreating God for a final revolution even as he prays for steady revolvency, than he is about his capac- ity to recognize the prevailing weather. The weatherman has become a weather maker. In other words, the Laki haze - he continues to</page><page sequence="13">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 489 wander, he assures us near the end, "Neither mist, / Nor freezing sky, not sultry, checking me" (6.296-7) - has become his own. Climatic Continuity and Apocalyptic Knowledge The idea that time, whether secular or di- vine, moves toward disclosure - a final inter- pretation, the narrative revelation Aristotle termed anagnorisis , an apocalyptic unveil- ing or judgment- has deep roots in Greek as well as Judeo-Christian thought. This idea is expressed in modernity's recurrent meteoro- logical tropes- fog lifting, a storm passing, a new dawn - which narrativize the progressive trajectory that makes the present ever more recognizable. In The Task , though, Cowper de- scribes "modern times" as shrouded in haze. In an unsettled, modern climate, time loses its outline. The reasons for this are complex. The "present obfuscation" becomes a figurai crux for a host of temporal-epistemic conditions, of which the strange weather of a volcanogenic climate is only one. The Enlightenment divi- sion of knowledge separates weather from his- tory, even as it generates a kind of unreadable human atmosphere; providential and eschato- logical explanations lose their force; seasonal experience, and thus the memory encoded in climatic periodicity, is attenuated; new modes of energy production and their environmen- tal consequences outscale modes of repre- sentation; and time itself appears to pass, to dissipate, ever faster. Just as there is no reason to assume that time necessarily tends toward revelation, however, there is no reason to as- sume that time simply passes. Time may also be understood as cumulative, like the "pile of debris" that, for Benjamins Angel of History, provides the only sure measure of history's tempestuous flux ("On the Concept" 392; see also Baucom 319-21)- or like greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Benjamin himself sought to identify a kairotic measure that would enable recogni- tion of "a present [that] is not a transition" ("On the Concept" 396), a form of memory, still time, that would make the present legible, a "now of recognizability" ( Arcades Project 473). For Benjamin, climatic regularity re- cords with the palpability of long experience the continuity in which historical change is enfolded and thereby revealed. In "The Story- teller" he writes of the First World War, "A generation that had gone to school on horse- drawn streetcars now stood under the open sky in a landscape where nothing remained unchanged but the clouds and, beneath those clouds, in a force field of destructive torrents and explosions, the tiny, fragile human body" (144). Benjamins atmospheric tropes stand for the cumulative and cyclical experience against which the immediacy of a narrowing instant may be known. The clouds, the air, and the sun are witnesses to history's tumult, palpable figures for the "tiny fissures in the continu- ous catastrophe" and "splinters of messianic time" that sustain the possibility of interrup- tion and revelation ("Central Park" 185; "On the Concept" 397). Benjamin writes of how what has apparently passed may be reintro- duced as that which illuminates and so alters the present: "The past carries with it a secret index by which it is referred to redemption. Doesn't a breath of the air that pervaded ear- lier days caress us as well?" ("On the Concept" 390). This atmospheric index- a countervail- ing temporal order, archive of the other times that remain- reappears, in "On the Concept of History," as the "open air of history" (395) and the "sun which is rising in the sky of his- tory" (390). It is a blast of wind that bears "the fullness of [the] past" (390), driving the clouds before it: "In every true work of art there is a place where, for one who removes there, it blows cool like the wind of a coming dawn. . . . Progress has its seat not in the continu- ity of elapsing time but in its interferences- where the truly new makes itself felt for the first time, with the sobriety of dawn" ( Arcades Project 474). Benjamin's "now time" ( Jetztzeit ),</page><page sequence="14">490 "The Present Obfuscation": Cowper's Task and the Time of Climate Change [ P M L A in other words, assumes climatic continuity, time that endures and so measures alteration ("On the Concept" 395). To identify the end in the middle, motion in stillness, what is novel by way of what remains, is the narrative work accomplished in the periodicity of a stable climate. Like Cowper, Benjamin diagnoses the temporal disorders that make the mod- ern present unavailable - what he calls the "blinding experience of the age of large-scale industrialism" ("On Some Motifs" 314; my emphasis) - and yet holds out hope, sustained in a metaphorics of meteorological legibility, that buffeted by arctic winds the clouds will still part, unveiling other destinies. In directing attention to our own climate crisis, the unprecedented state of planetary emergency that began with the industrializa- tion of carbon energy during Cowper's life- time, McKibben anticipates an apocalyptic revelation enabled by the knowledge produced by temporal juxtaposition: "More and more frequently, [climatic] changes will clash with our perceptions, until, finally, our sense of na- ture as eternal and separate is washed away, and we will see all too clearly what we have done" (8; my emphasis). In McKibben s secu- larized eschatology, what actuates our instant of self-recognition is the clarifying breach of nonsynchronous temporal orders. Toward the end of his book, however, he offers a differ- ent portrait of the future. In a world in which modern time is the only time, in which the perceptual baseline of climatic continuity has given way to anthropogenic forcing, he writes, "The loss of memory will be the eternal loss of meaning" (213). Without the prevailing weather as its measure, time is emptied of palpable content and becomes unknowable.15 Immersed in "time that passes," we fail to notice the catastrophe of the present because we are unable to represent the schism within what endures and returns, the periodicity that endows time with duration (Latour 68). We are unable, as Cowper intuited in June 1783, to read in modern weather signs of historical rupture, to recognize in the passing instant the disappearance of the time that remains. Notes 1. All citations of Cowper's letters refer to volume 2 of The Letters and Prose Writings. 2. Edmund Burke III asks how modernity may be redefined within "the larger context of the flow, conver- sion, and storage of planetary bioenergy." He concludes that the Industrial Revolution constitutes an "unprec- edented break" (33). Modernity is defined not only by novel modalities of capitalist expansion, production, and consumption enabled by intensive coal- and oil-based energy but also by a growing gap between the means and perception of energy production. 3. Michel Serres anticipates such a periodization when he reads J. M. W. Turner's hazy Romantic land- and seascapes, which envisage "the entire world" as the inte- rior of "a steam engine," as realist representations of the Industrial Revolution ("Turner" 57). 4. The arcades represent an image of progress Benjamin found exemplified in a book published in 1886 in which the author speculates that by 1987 "a crystal canopy . . . would slide over the city in the case of rain" (Arcades Project 109). 5. In Geòrgie Modernity , Goodman characterizes Cowper's verse as managing the process whereby the de- mands of historical eventfulness, especially the cacopho- nies of information conveyed by the daily newspaper, may be registered in silence, stillness, and inarticulate aífect. Favret, in War at a Distance , studies The Task's di- vergent temporalities, most significantly the "meantime" of modern war, the anticipatory present in which "his- torical meaning cannot yet be assigned" (80). 6. White writes that the simile to which Cowper al- ludes- "As when the sun, new risen, / Looks through the horizontal, misty air, / Shorn of his beams"- captures the "superstitious kind of dread, with which the minds of men are apt to be impressed by . . . strange and un- usual phenomena" (248). Horace Walpole, writing to the countess of Upper Ossory on 15 July 1783, draws on the same simile: "A sun shorn of his beams, and a moon that only serves to make darkness visible, are mighty homo- geneal to a distracted state" (21). 7. As Elissa Marder explains, "[W]hen one receives the returned gaze of the world, one is 'remembered' by the world through those very parts of the self- the un- conscious memory traces- that one has forgotten" (27). 8. Writing to the earl of Strafford on 24 June 1783, Walpole describes the Laki haze: "We have exchanged spring and summer for autumn and winter, as well as day for night." This inverted weather prompts reflection on a general attenuation of seasonal awareness: "The most</page><page sequence="15">12 7-3 ] Tobias Menely 491 fashionable hurry into the country at Christmas and Eas- ter, let the weather be ever so bad." The beau monde is indifferent to the weather, and Walpole is indifferent to fashion: "The sun and the seasons were not gone out of fashion when I was young, and I may do what I will with them now I am old" (15-16). 9. Martin Priestman sees Cowper's focus on the ills of gambling as exaggerated: "Gambling was indeed one of the luxuries to which the country's fair dues were being diverted, but to make this specific sin the whole cause of large-scale social change is just wishful thinking" (105). But if one understands gambling, as Benjamin does, as a trope for the temporality of both speculative capitalism and factory labor, in which a subject is "completely liq- uidated [of his] memories" ("On Some Motifs" 329-32), Cowper's critique seems prescient. 10. In Jane Austen's Mansfield Park , Fanny Price responds to Mr. Rushworth's plan to raze an avenue of trees by quoting these lines from The Task (41). As he was completing The Task , Cowper published one of his most popular short poems, "The Poplar Field," which laments the local climate change caused by deforestation, in the Gentleman's Magazine (Jan. 1785). 11. Cowper defines poetic labor as the cognitive act of slowing the mental phantasmagoria: "T' arrest the fleeting images that fill / The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast" (2.290-91). Benjamin's "On the Concept of History" contains a surprising echo of Cowper's de- scription: "Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts, but their arrest as well. Where thinking sud- denly comes to a stop in a constellation saturated with tensions, it gives the constellation a shock. ... In this structure [the historical materialist] recognizes the mes- sianic arrest of happening" (396). Cowper worries that in an accelerated media culture, the authority of literature- and perhaps the claims of a prophetic poet to recognize "messianic arrest"- will be supplanted: "at a time [like the] present, what Author can stand in competition with a Newspaper" ("To William Unwin," 29 Feb. 1784 [220]). 12. Deidre Lynch has identified alongside "green Romanticism" a parallel tradition she felicitously terms "greenhouse Romanticism," concerned with the global circulation of natural objects and the tropes of rhetori- cal naturalization in national and domestic spaces, above all the "artificial climates" of the increasingly popular greenhouses (692). 13. Favret sees this interruption as a turning point in the poem. "With the inrush of noise" from the storm outside, "the poet takes up an alternative mode for tell- ing the time of war, one that turns its untimeliness not to wayward vacancy but to fullness and conviction" - to the "voice of prophecy" (82). 14. During the awful Laki summer, Walpole ex- pressed a similar concern: "I begin to think that the Rumbolds and Co. have robbed the Indies of their cli- mate as well as of their gold and diamonds" ("To the Countess of Upper Ossory," 4 Aug. 1783 [38]). 15. In a recent book examining McKibben's argument, Paul Wapner rejects this nostalgia for apocalyptic disclo- sure, deploying a meteorological trope to illustrate our contemporary condition: "Clouds have overtaken the night sky of environmentalism. We are on our own to define and negotiate our way toward a collective destination" (176). Works Cited Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park. Ed. Claudia Johnson. New York: Norton, 1998. Print. Baucom, Ian.
