The symbols concerned are those of the deities of the lunar asterisms and the planets-the naksatra and navagrahlhz series, respectively, of the Hindus-as com- pared with the structural features and symbols of the 20-day period in the 260-day Tzolkin/Tonalpohualli sacred calendar of Mesoamerica; a series of nine lunar hieroglyphs of the Maya; and certain groups of deities of the Aztecs and the Zapotecs. These comparisons seem feeble not only because they are superficial and intrinsically contradictory, but also because they are opposed by a vast body of variations in Hindu reli- gious symbolism. Furthermore, they are chronologically incom- patible with historical events. The arguments against these comparisons of imagined parallels have broader implications concerning the totally independent development of astronomi- cal-astrological beliefs among pre-Columbian societies isolated from the Old World, and they illustrate the hazards of uti- lizing a veneer of religious data that would obscure this in- dependence. The notion that certain features of pre-Columbian religious symbolism and art stemmed from Mesoamerican contacts with the cultures of India or Indianized Asia is persistently fostered by a minority of modern Americanists. It is reminiscent of earlier hypotheses that seem to reflect a reluctance to grant New World aborigines the potential of fully independent social evolution, particularly when there exists the slightest hint, albeit imaginary, of "parallel," "ancestral" situations among the Old World civilizations. Not only systematic archaeology, but also modern physical anthropology, geology, hematology, and epidemiology all strongly suggest the absence of foreign influences in Mesoamerica earlier than the 16th century (see Stewart 1973). One cannot ignore the data from these fields when discussing trans-Pacific culture diffusion, though the present theme is not at all dependent on their support. The early history of beliefs about culture diffusion to the New World, however, is of some relevance even though we need not consider it here. The writings of Garcia (1607), Viollet-le-Duc (1863), Charnay (1885), and Baron de Waldeck (1838), among others, set the tone of views held between the 17th and 19th centuries. Bizarre and fanciful though they may seem to us now, they were moulded by contemporary scholar- ship and European social attitudes. Modern proponents of the view that cultural influences may indeed have been transmitted across the Pacific during the few centuries immediately pre- ceding or following the beginning of the Christian era differ essentially little from its earlier champions, at least regarding the relative ease with which they seem to detect influences that, they imply, were grafted upon Mesoamerican cultures. The data these proponents advance, however, are characterized 1 This work was done while I was Visiting Fellow at Yale Univer- sity, 1976-77.

BALAJI MUNDKUR has an adjunct appointment on the faculty of Art History, to lecture on Hindu-Buddhist religious art and architecture and on Islamic art, while retaining his formal posi- tion as Associate Professor of Biology at the University of Con- necticut (Box U-42, Storrs, Conn. 06268, U.S.A.). His publications in the sciences have appeared in Experimental Cell Research, Cancer Research, Genetics, Journal of Histochemistry and Cyto- chemistry, Acta Cytologica, Nature, Zeitschrift fur Zellforschung, and the Journal of Bacteriology, among others. For the past several years, however, his research interests have been exclusively in the humanities and cross-cultural, particularly concerning anthro- pological aspects of religious art, animal cults, and iconography. His publications in these areas include "The Cult of the Serpent in the Americas: Its Asian Background" (CA 17:429-41), "The Enigma of Vainayaki" (Artibus Asiae 37[4]), and "Western Karnataka Icons at Shirali" (Archives of Asian Art and Pro- ceedings of the American Oriental Society). He has two articles now in press-"The Roots of Ophidian Symbolism" (Ethos) and "Notes on Two Ancient Fertility Cults" (East and West). He is currently preparing for publication an article, "Hayya in Islamic Traditions," and a book on serpent cults of the world utilizing an approach based both in the sciences and in the humanities. He received his education both in India, where he was born, and in the U.S.A. and owes his nonscientific interests partly to extensive travels. The present paper, submitted in final form 29 xii 77, was sent for comment to 50 scholars. The responses are printed below and are followed by a reply by the author. Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 541</page><page sequence="2">by considerably more attractive sophistry, involving deeper facets of art, symbolism, and religion, and for this reason merit attention. The general topic is covered in a recent sym- posium and review (Riley et al. 1971, Gardini 1974). It is remarkable how certain attitudes from the older litera- ture have been revived in the face of contradictory data and, sometimes, simple logic. For example, Baron de Waldeck, who between 1829 and 1836 explored the Mayan ruins at Palenque, made sketches of friezes at this site purportedly depicting ele- phant heads. Commenting on these, Thompson (1927:393), whose authority and archaeological experience few will ques- tion, understated that Waldeck, "who . . . was more of an artist than an archaeologist, was not strongly blessed with the gift of accuracy." Waldeck's sketches are paradoxical not only because the elephant is not a Western-hemisphere species and even its prehistoric relatives were extinct here thousands of years ago, but also because the sketches have no correspon- dence at all to actual Mesoamerican relics. Yet, Heine-Geldern (1966) and Ekholm (1953), unaware of the complexities of the art of India, and on the basis of very meager examples which show only the most tenuous traits of elephantine physi- ognomy, have regarded them as one of the indicators of Hindu- Buddhist religious influence in Mexico, exerted in the early post-Christian centuries and peaking at perhaps ca. A.D. 700. Various Southeast Asian countries-ancient India's cultural outposts-are envisioned as way stations. Examples of this kind, based largely on subjective compari- sons of works of art or other fragile coincidences such as occa- sional linguistic similarities, need not detain us. The icono- graphic and architectural precepts of Hinduism are unique, and the differences in the essential qualities of Asian and pre- Columbian religious art are wholly implacable, not to mention their quite distinct conventions of symbolism, aesthetic pref- erences, and treatment of the subject matter portrayed. Rands (1953), Caso (1962), and Willey (1974) have questioned the alleged Asian "origins" of artistic motifs even without in- voking the support of Hindu iconographic texts. I will examine only the more beguiling line of argument of three modem writers, Kirchhoff (1964), Kelley (1969, 1972, 1974), and Barthel (1974, 1975a), who imply that a certain sig- nificant class of resemblances exists among the cultures of Hinduized Asia and Mesoamerica. Their thesis is beguiling not in that it is stated eloquently and accurately, but, rather, in that it depends, in my opinion, upon a body of specialized knowledge so unfamiliar and, understandably, difficult for most archaeologists and anthropologists to grasp that, unless closely scrutinized, it is apt to be seductive. Oblivious of the intrica- cies, they invoke certain debatable features of Hindu pan- theism. These they isolate from context, treat superficially, document inadequately, and only very perfunctorily cast against a historical background. They compare certain Mexi- can with Asian, predominantly Hindu, deities, categorizing them by function and symbolic attributes such as their animal mounts or the natural elements they personify. They either interpret these features with undue latitude or unaccountably overlook them, to the extent that the detection of resem- blances between these deities is held out as palpable. In the end, what their arguments disclose is insensitivity to an ex- tremely complex Asian religion and its literature-the more so because an immense body of ancient texts in Sanskrit has been translated and competently annotated by Hindu as well as Western scholars. Thus, the majority of physical anthro- pologists and archaeologists, who, surely, are even less cog- nizant of this literature than the diffusionists, are liable to be confused by the clash of the latter's conclusions with their own more systematically established tenets. It is in this sense that claims of Mesoamerican "parallels" and "Hindu influ- ences" are subtly distractive. I wish to refute these, pointing out only my most salient objections and some of the key sources. To facilitate verification, I have cited, with few ex- ceptions, works in the European languages. An important part of this critique deals with what may seem at first to be an emphasis on tendentious detail. I do not disagree with any general theory of diffusion which holds that the implantation of strange cultural elements from across the vast expanses of the Pacific, if such indeed occurred, very likely entailed complex modifications of the imported traits. Yet, it is the three diffusionists considered here who choose to envision parallels built upon superficial details of religious symbolism. ICONOGRAPHY To understand the principal subject of this critique-calen- drical symbolism-the reader may require a few, very brief in- troductory remarks on iconography. An overwhelmingly great proportion of the Hindu-Buddhist archaeological record, espe- cially that part of it which is significant from the viewpoint of possible diffusion to Mesoamerica, belongs to the post- rather than the pre-Christian era. The religious art of this period underwent, in India, a rapid development. Its roots lie in the pre-Christian centuries, but, beginning a further differ- entiation during the Christian era, it had crystallized well before the end of the 1st millennium. This interval coincides with the growth of Puranic literature, an immense body of fanciful myths rather like the Greek ones. They retain a weak, modified base of the much earlier traditions of the Vedic and Epic periods. The essentially demotic, rather than philosophi- cal, character of the Puranas was complemented by a profu- sion of artistic and architectural monuments representing the very complex Hindu pantheon. The need to categorize the attributes of the innumerable deities for purposes of identifi- cation and as a guide for the sculptor or painter and the archi- tect was fulfilled through numerous very detailed texts in San- skrit, known generically as the silpa s'stra and vdstu sdstra. These sastra prescribe almost every imaginable detail of image making: when and how to begin work on one; the reli- gious ceremonies and rituals involved in the process; the materials to be used; composition of the alloys; colors; animal and other symbols; postures of seated and standing deities; ornaments; vestments; ancillary attendants; the days or times most propitious for worshipping a particular deity; the varied forms assumed by a deity; taboos; and an incredible list of other details. It is no wonder, as we shall see, that differences of interpretation of detail exist in the various texts despite a certain underlying unity and standardization. Thus, the reli- gious myths of the Puranas and the astronomical-astrological beliefs of the period, which lasted until about the mid-i5th century, were interpreted through highly formalized, easily recognizable symbolic devices. What characterized the art of India, however, was an insis- tence upon the observance of certain canons of proportions, basic symbolic motifs, and gestures which convey a message. The iconometric and broad morphological constraints upon the artist fashioning an image of a deity were severely conserva- tive. It is these qualities that typify Hindu (and, by extension, Buddhist) art that have enabled the perpetuation of the "In- dianness" of its visual impact even in those countries of South- east Asia to which India exported its religions and that demand instant verification when a claim is made that traces of its symbolism are detectable in the art motifs or abstract calen- drical signs of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. I will exemplify these remarks with reference only to the work of Kirchhoff, but they are no less pertinent when Kelley and Barthel invoke Hindu deities and their symbols-as these authors understand them-in their comparisons of Hindu and Mesoamerican ca- lendrical structure. 542 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA Kirchhoff's criteria for his thesis that the Hindus diffused their religious system to Mesoamerica include the practice of blood sacrifices and such traits as are ascribed to deities like those of rain, war, fire, fertility, and death among diverse cultures the world over-cultures totally isolated from each other during their historical development. Kirchhoff draws up a list of 12 Hindu-Javanese deities to parallel the Mexican. There are, according to Kirchhoff (1964b:13), resemblances in "a considerable number of motives in religious art, in- cluding the representation of specific gods with their charac- teristic paraphernalia." In fact, a comparison of the iconog- raphies of Mexico (Seler 1960-61, Beyer 1965, Nicholson 1971, Proskouriakoff 1950) with those of India (Gopinatha Rao 1914, Banerjea 1956) will reveal the hollowness of this assertion. Kirchhoff mentions not a single one of the numerous pertinent Hindu treatises either to support his claim or to facilitate independent judgment by the reader. The Hindu artistic convention of representing deities with multiple pairs of hands is well known. Each of the hands is normally assigned a specific object, such as a weapon, flower, trident, axe, or conch. The deity is not only identified by attributes like these and the particular order in which they are held, but also char- acterized by hand gestures, or mudra, that denote the deity's aspect or mood, for example, threat, anger, protection, ser- monizing, generosity, benediction, etc. In addition, there are innumerable details involving ancillary personages, animal mounts, hierarchical ranking, and taboos, all of which are set against a background suggesting a specific myth concerning the deity. In short, the Hindu sculptor's personal and profes- sional expression was constrained by strict adherence to the traditional rules of composition and artistic proportions. These conventions were so standardized between the early post- Christian era and the 10th century that neither the identifica- tion nor the exact meaning of an artistic representation is likely to remain obscure. Nothing remotely akin to these Hindu symbols and conventions occurs in Mesoamerica. What little is known about gesture in the art of the Maya (Benson 1973), taken together with the extraordinary disagreement among modern Mayanists as to whether Classic Maya sculp- tures represent priest-kings or deities, only serves to sharpen the contrasts. I shall return to these fundamental contrasts of religious systems later, but an incongruity must be pointed out imme- diately. The parallels Kirchhoff draws are not between Hindu deities and the shadowy ones of the Maya, usually considered by diffusionists the primary recipients of Hindu religious cul- ture. Rather, they involve the deities of the Aztecs-a people identifiable in history only some five centuries after the cessa- tion of alleged Hindu influence upon the Maya, whose own, undoubted cultural impress upon the Aztecs was transmitted indirectly through the Toltecs. Even if one were to imagine that direct contact between the Hindus and Aztecs occurred in about the 14th century A.D. or that earlier, indirect influ- ences were exerted through peoples other than the Maya, Kirchhoff's effort to seek parallels between their deities does not withstand scrutiny. The fundamental differences are too many, and they contrast glaringly with the occasional, minor "shared" attributes which diffusionists regard as impressive. For example, a parallel is drawn between the gods of fire, the Hindu Agni and the Mexican Xiuhtecuhtli. Gopinatha Rao (1914, vol. 2:523-24) translates the Agamic description of Agni's iconic characteristics as follows: Agni should be of red colour, with four arms and the hair or jati of the head which should also be of red colour, standing on end and forming a sort of prabhdmandala [aureole]. He should be seated upon a ram. The front two hands should be held in the varada [boon-granting] and abhaya ["fear not"] poses, while in the back right hand there should be the sruk [ladle] and in the back left hand the sakti [spear]. According to another aulhority, Agni should be of the colour of molten gold or the red colour of the rising sun and be clad in red garments; he should also have a moustache and a yajiiopavita [sacred thread across the torso]. In his hands he should keep the aksamdld [rosary] and the kamandalu [ritual waterpot]. Where he is represented as possessing four arms, the Vishnudharmottara states, he should carry in his right hands the flames of fire (jvdlds) and the trisula [trident spear] and in one of the left hands the aksamdld, while the remaining left hand should be embracing his wife Svaha. It also adds that Agni should have four sharp tusks and that his chariot should be drawn by four parrots and that the banner on it should be dhAmaketu [smoke]. Of course, variations of this description, which is taken from the Suprabhedahgama, occur even in India. Some icons of Agni are two-headed, and other variations of major and minor na- ture occur in texts like the Devatdmfirtiprakarattam, Matsya- Purdaia, Ruipamandanatm, Visnudharmottara-Purdna, and others too numerous to be named. A certain degree of transmutation of iconographic precepts would be inevitable were Hindu influ- ences grafted upon the very different Mesoamerican culture. Still, one would be hard put to recognize in Xiuhtecuhtli a feature which approximates any of these in significant ways. The single most characteristic attribute apparent in the de- tailed descriptions of Xiuhtecuhtli (Seler 1960-61; Beyer 1965:237-44; Palacios 1935) is one with which Agni has no mythic association whatsoever-the serpent. Xiuhtecuhtli's fiery reptile, the xiuhcoatl, is the direct metaphoric equivalent of Agni's flames, but his numerous other symbols are icono- graphically no less important. On the other hand, Xiuhtecuhtli, like Agni, is symbolized by red, the color people everywhere normally link with heat and fire. Few would seriously advance this or the fact that Xiuhtecuhtli occasionally carries the guacamaya (macaw) as more than superficial similarities. It would seem superfluous to argue further along iconological lines to point out flaws in Kirchhoff's equivalences and group- ings of Hindu and Mexican divinities. The example I have just given, along with others involving deities of the sun, rain, and cardinal directions discussed previously (Mundkur 1976: 432, 452), should suffice. In addition, many of my statements concerning the views of Kelley in the next section on the naksatra series also apply to Kirchhoff's, as I will show with specific examples. The weaknesses of Kirchhoff's thesis have been considered from another viewpoint by Caso (1964), who discusses the many factors which make transoceanic historical contacts between Asia and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica highly improbable. Kirchhoff's simplistic reasoning is perhaps best illustrated by his own words. Invoking pre-Columbian Chinese influences-which, he believed, may have fused with predomi- nantly Hindu imports to Mesoamerica-he compared the Chi- nese dragon, mythic symbol of benevolence, prosperity, and life, with the Mexican Itzpapalotl. The latter is a demoniacal butterfly goddess who bears the emblems of death on her face. Itzpapalotl, states Kirchhoff (1964b:15), "is likewise drawn with wings and claws, that is, as a dragon." And (p. 27), "We might think that the great religious complex of War, Human Sacrifice and Blood first arose among the Olmecs if it were not for the fact that the rise of that people or rather group of peoples seems to have coincided with the arrival in Mexico of Indian-Southeast Asian ideas and institutions." Need one ask the obvious questions as to what evidence Kirchhoff had for the prior absence of these traits in Mesoamerica and where he got the notion that the Hindus practiced bloodthirsty human sacrifices? Apart from sati-the rite of self-immolation, practiced symbolically by upper-class widowed women during the Vedic age (ca. 1500 B.C.) and revived in a literal way, though only occasionally and in extremely limited situations, during the mid-2d millennium A.D-human sacrifices have Vol. 19 - No. 3 * September 1978 543</page><page sequence="4">never had a place among Hindu religious customs (Apte 1951: 381, 454, 513; Malik 1928; Thapar 1966:41, 152). Cases of child sacrifice to the goddess Kili have sometimes been given much publicity in recent times, but these are exceedingly rare, uninstitutionalized aberrations which few will seriously con- sider to be one of the typical Hindu legacies to Mesoamerica. THE NAKSATRA SERIES The propositions of Kirchhoff (1964a) and Kelley (1969), including their tabulated alignments of Asian and Mesoameri- can calendrical symbols, undoubtedly possess a certain super- ficial attraction stemming from their originality. Their basic assumptions have more recently been adopted by Barthel (1974), but his discussion of the theme of this section is brief and based on much the same type of reasoning. I will consider primarily Kelley's and Kirchhoff's schemes, as they are earlier and more exhaustive. Kelley (1969) concentrates on comparisons involving as- tronomy, with several tables and astral maps pertaining to Chinese, Hindu, Jain, Burmese, and Cambodian divinities or calendric symbols, and the Greek and Hebrew alphabets. At first glance, these impressed me greatly, particularly because Joseph Needham's great work on the history of Chinese science forms one of the bases of Kelley's discussion of Asian- Mesoamerican "parallels." One soon realizes, however, that the pivot of Kelley's argument is the central position he accords to Hindu lunar calendrical deities and that considerations in- volving other Asian countries are wholly ancillary and less weighty. Needham's "discussion of the Hindu nakshatras [lu- nar asterisms]," says Kelley (p. 147), "covers the main points. [His] analysis draws heavily upon the work of de Saussure and of J. B. Biot but adds a great deal to their accounts.... Needham, rather than his sources, will be cited." The writings of de Saussure and Biot, one might point out, have long since been superseded by more accurate and pertinent information on Hindu astral concepts. Oddly, if one explores Needham's text (1959:252-58), one finds that he nowhere cites the list of naksatra utilized by Kelley. Presumably, the latter has extracted this from limited information given in one or another of the very few sources of Hindu astronomy which Needham himself depends upon, though these adequately fulfil his own quite different aims. Kelley points out sequences and attributes of Hindu deities associated with the lunar cycle, purportedly to establish paral- lel sequences and attributes of days, which, in the Aztec and Maya calendars, are named after deities, animals, or natural phenomena. As with Kirchhoff's alignments, one is struck by the historical paradox of Kelley's statements (p. 151) that "the Maya list shows only four obvious sequent similarities with the Hindu deity list" whereas "the Aztec list shows 12 of 20 obvious, 'primary' sequential correspondences with the Maya list but only seven with the Hindu deity lists." That is to say, the Aztec calendar exhibits three more correspondences with the Hindu deity list than are allegedly detectable in the much earlier list of Maya calendric symbols. This claim tacitly carries an implication which is difficult to accept: namely, that the Hindus exerted cultural influence more effectively upon the Aztecs than upon the Maya. The calendrical concepts of the latter were surely mature by the first quarter of the 4th cen- tury A.D. (Thompson 1954:53), and their cultural eclipse, partly by Toltec domination, was largely manifest by the end of the 1st millennium A.D. The Aztecs did not clearly emerge in ethnohistory before the beginning of the 14th century. Thus, the paradox arises from the circumstance that while undoubtedly the Maya transmitted, through the Toltecs, the essential features of their calendar to the Aztec homeland, history and archaeology-and the ensuing discussion-cast doubt upon the notion that the Hindus diffused their calen- drical symbols to the Maya, the Aztec, or any Meosamerican society which affected the latter. Certain details in Kelley's comparisons require close ques- tioning. For the convenience of readers, I have reproduced his crucial figure 19 as my table 1, omitting his columns on Chi- nese lunar mansions and on the Greek and Hebrew alphabets because they are irrelevant for our purposes. I have, in addi- tion, eliminated the glyphs linked to Maya day names and a pictorial column on Jain symbols. The Jains are a very small, ultraorthodox religious group very different from the Hindus and share many of these symbols with the latter, but they never diffused their beliefs beyond India, since sentiments of self-pollution prohibited them from venturing overseas. Except for these deletions, the contents of table 1 appear exactly as Kelley presents them, his errors and omissions included. Table 1 should be explained briefly: In the first column are 28 Hindu naksatra (lunar mansions or asterisms). Each repre- sents a different group of stars, varying in number from one to about one hundred. They occupy successive segments of the night sky corresponding to angular distances of approxi- mately 1310 in the moon's orbital path. Now, the moon, in addition to moving westward along with the stars, is also ob- servable as slowly moving eastward among them. The fact that the moon acquires a different background of naksatra about every 24 hours and cyclically returns to the initial naksatra in about 271 days explains why 27 or 28 members comprise the series. Each naksatra is personified by a young girl, has a fixed sequential position in Kelley's scheme, and is associated with a presiding deity. The deity list, as Kelley chooses it, and the attributes of each deity, as Kelley em- phasizes them, are shown in the second column. It is the sequences of certain of these deities, together with their attri- butes, that, according to Kelley, betray similarities to his cor- responding alignments of Aztec and Maya day names, attri- butes of the days, or deities, as listed in the remaining four columns. My opposition to this claim stems from Hindu litera- ture and art, but important facets of the Maya and Aztec religions are also involved. Before I elaborate on table 1, two important points need stressing: First, Kelley's emphasis is not on the naksatra list per se, but on the characteristics of a few selected naksatra and, even more, of their presiding deities. I will endeavor to show that these Hindu deities (a) are not so commandingly important in the naksatra series as Kelley imagines, (b) have inconstant, interchangeable attributes, and (c) are inconstant in their sequential positions. Second, the sequences of the individual naksatra have not, historically, always commenced with the same leading naksatra. In addition, a certain naksatra may be listed twice but in the company of different presiding deities; a particular naksatra may occupy the same sequential position in separate lists, with different presiding deities; two different naksatra, each with a different deity, may occupy the same sequential position in different lists; and one of the nak- satra in a sequence may be dropped. Variations like these only show the futility of rigid alignments of Hindu versus Meso- american deity lists. The implications are most pertinent to questions of time relationships in culture diffusion. In the list chosen by Kelley, a standard, "modern" one used even today, the naksatra series is headed by AMvini and ends with Revati. AMvini's leading position only signifies the fact that the vernal equinox occurred in the first point of AMvini approximately during the early to mid-6th century A.D. and that this particular naksatra series was not used before that event. As proof of this, one may point out that the AMvini-to- Revati order is attested neither in the Yajniavalkya-smrti nor in even the most recent additions, ca. A.D. 500, to the Maha- bharata (Chatterjee 1967:111), which indicates that innova- tions in astronomy had not as yet crept into the religious 544 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA literature of the masses. This is consistent with the fact that astronomical treatises which adhere to the AMvini-to-Revati order are not known earlier than the Suirya-Siddhdnta or the Khandakhddyaka of Brahmagupta (A.D. 598-665?). Hazra (1958:143) deduces that the old Krttika-to-Bharani order "held ground at best down to the latter half of the 5th century A.D.," and that the AMvini-to-Revati series was "an established fact in all parts of India . . . only as late as A.D. 550," approxi- mately coinciding with its adoption in the Brhat-Sathitd of Varahamihira.2 Here I must indicate the significance of the concept of mukham (Jdipramukha), or temporal headship, of the nak- satra series. In the Vedic age, commencing 2000 B.C., and earlier, epochs were named after particular members of a series -the change of leadership synchronizing with the end of one naksatra epoch and the beginning of another. In the earliest, 1Rg Vedic, period, for example, the leading naksatra was Mrgagiras, but a recession to the constellation Pleiades, i.e., the naksatra Krttika, is reflected in the literature comprising the Brahmanas (as in the Taittiriya-Brihmana) and in the Taittir6ya-Sathkitd, i.e., ca. 800 B.C. Law (1965) and Abhyan- kar (1976) give many details, as do Macdonell and Keith (1967), but the latter authors erroneously state (pp. 4-20) that "all the lists of the Naksatras begin with Krttikas." Krttika persisted as leading member surely during the time of Patanjali (whose dates of birth and death are problematical), but even Panini (300-250 B.C.?), in his Astddhydyl, recognized Krttika for ritual purposes but placed gravistha (= Dha- nistha), and not AMvini, at the head of the list for ordinary reckoning (Agrawala 1953:177). In the Mahabharata, the leading naksatra is Sravan. a. The Vinudharmottara-Purdna (A.D. 400-500) invariably retains Krttika as mukham. Even the Agni-Purdna (A.D. 800-900) follows this practice, except once, in verse 8 of chapter 219, which recognizes Agvini as mukham. From the viewpoint of cultural diffusion, these essential points enable us to detect a curious feature in Kelley's list. In conformity with modern usage, he commences the naksatra series with AMvini in the lead, but vitiates chronological con- notations by giving mukham rank No. 1, midstream, and for no apparent reason, to Krttika. Thus, we are denied the clue as to when the naksatra deities should be understood to have been imported into Mesoamerican thought. The transition from Krttika, as mukham, to Agvini was effected, as I have just said, only in the mid-6th century A.D. This date heralds the Puranic age and coincides with the active cultural domina- tion by the Hindus of the coastal or riverine regions of what are now Java, Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Here they left their legacies of Puranic iconography, myths, secular tradi- tions, and, in particular, an important corpus of inscriptions in the Sanskritic and Dravidian languages of India (Coed6s 1968, Gonda 1973, Majumdar 1963, Nilakantha Sastri 1949). Evidences of these cultural imports are as abundant in South- east Asia as their absence is conspicuous in Mesoamerica. Not a shred of these survives, not even recognizably transmuted, in any of the ceremonial centers of Mexico and Guatemala to which the Hindus are believed to have diffused their religious symbolism. Yet, Kelley sees these traits in a body of naksatra- associated deities whom the Hindus themselves do not envision in quite the same light that he casts upon them. That these presiding deities grace the naksatra series merely honorifically, while overriding importance is bestowed upon the naksatra, is evident in numerous ways. In astrology, so crucial in day-to-day activities and so inseparable from the lunar calendar of the Hindus, one's destiny is considered to be determined by the particular naksatra under which one is born. Children ordinarily are named not after the presiding deity so much as after the naksatra, or the various stars they represent, particularly when these are considered to be auspi- cious (Kane 1938). To this day, Hindu women worship Krttika and Rohini, rather than their corresponding deities, Agni and Prajapati (Hazra 1958:176). A commentary (pp. 40, 41) on the Yajnavalkya-smrti recommends "secret," "beneficial," naksatra names. Epithets like Amba, Dula, Varsayanti (and other stars represented by Krttika), Rohini, Citra, Anuradha, Revati, Ardra, Siddhya, Tisya, or their derivatives are common even today. The practice is an ancient one, specifically noted in the Astddhydyi (IV.3.28, 34, 37; VIII.3.100) in the 3d cen- tury B.C. Indeed, it is probable that the importance of the naksatra antedates the arrival of the Aryans and their sub- sequent addition of their (mainly male) deities as regents of these lunar asterisms. The pre-Aryan element is evident from such Dravidian deity names as Jyestha among the naksatra. The apotropaic, divinatory utility of the naksatra has always overshadowed the ornamental role of their presiding deities (Bapat 1953). The second argument against the placing of undue emphasis upon the presiding deities is summarized in table 2. It shows the variations in naksatra lists in only a few representative religious works, all of which belong to approximately the be- ginning of the 1st millennium B.C. They are based on Kirfel (1920), but I have added the presiding deity corresponding to each naksatra in the various lists. The deities are shown by capital letters, and, to avoid confusing the reader with too many names, are indicated only where there are differences in the Hindu texts or inconsistencies with Kelley's list in their appearance alongside a particular naksatra. When the presiding deity is not indicated, it should be assumed that there is no difference in the pairing from that given by Kelley. A few of these inconsistencies are the following: Rohin! (No. 2 and/or No. 16) occurs twice. Prajapati normally ac- companies Rohini in position No. 2, but Indra displaces him in two of the lists in position No. 16. Jyestha (No. 16) occu- pies the same position as Rohini in four of these lists, in one of which her presiding deity is neither Indra nor Prajapati but Varuna. The latter also appears alongside Satabhisaj (No. 23) in one of the lists, whereas Indra appears in the others. Vig&amp;khe (No. 14) has Indragni as presiding deity, not Indra as in Kelley's list. Citra (No. 12) has Tvastr in three cases but Indra in the two others. Invaka or Mrgagiras (No. 3) occurs alongside both Soma and Marutah. Mula (No. 17) is not only joined to another naksatra, Bharani, to give the com- pound appellation Miilabharani, but also replaced by Vicrtau- variations which involve three very different presiding deities. Minor variations in the form of appellation for certain naksatra are apparent in table 2, but, apart from this, one can easily detect in table 1 several differences in sequential positions of the presiding deities and naksatra in addition to those just pointed out. The trifling importance the Hindus attach to the sequence of the presiding deities is apparent in other ways. According to a myth of very early origin, popular to this day, the god Soma (the moon) is simultaneously the spouse of the 27 (nak- satra) daughters of Daksa. Soma's favorite, and the one in whose company he spends too much time, is Rohini (No. 2). However, Soma is never her presiding deity in any of the various naksatra lists, archaic or recent. To continue with the myth, Rohini's jealous sisters complain bitterly to their father, who, in anger, forces Soma to be impartial to his daughters and at the same time punishes him with the curse of consump- tion and alternate periods of recovery and wasting. This is why the moon, at present, waxes and wanes, becoming full along- side a different naksatra each month. By contrast, in the 2 For a critical appraisal of the date of Varahamihira, based on his own astronomical computations and statements, see Dhavale (1968).

Another important case is that of Krttika (No. 1), whose presiding deity is the very high-ranking god Agni (indi- cated in table 1). In the voluminous Agni-Purdna, a text named after Agni, Krttika nowhere appears as this god's con- sort (de Mallmann 1963). Some of the Puranic lists replace Agni, the god of fire, by Skanda (= Karttikeya), the god of war (Apte 1890:420[a], 2). A few of the Puranic pairings of naksatra and presiding deity that differ from the "modern" sequence in table 1 are mentioned by Gupta (1967:151, 169). That the Hindus histor- ically have attached only minor significance to these pairings and have never insisted on their rigidity is best disclosed by the Vdmana-Purdna (54.1-9), a text datable to between the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. In this, the god Visnu (No. 21 in table 1) presides over not only Sravana, but also every one of the remaining naksatra. He is conceptualized as "Naksatra- Purusa," the primeval man, each part of whose body is con- stituted by a different one of the 27 (not 28) naksatra. Pan- dey's (1970:81) comparisons of astrological works suggest that this concept can be traced back at least to about A.D. 550, when Varahamihira wrote his Brhat-Samthitd. The authenticity of Kelley's estimates of Hindu deities is in large part diminished by a facet of Hindu religious culture which I must initially explain. It involves the abstruse philo- sophical concept of dvandva, which, entwined with the demotic Vedic and Puranic mythology, is reflected in the bewildering situations just examined and in others yet to be discussed. Zimmer's (1951) very lucid treatment of dvandva should be consulted if further clarification is needed. Briefly, the central idea of the concept of dvandva is that, in the final reckoning, all manifestations of nature, material as well as phenomenal, intermediates as well as extremes, are but qualities which de- scribe, emanate from, and are fused in the Divine Power referred to as Brahman (brahmanah parimarah). In this ulti- mate, transcendental Power-the sole reality in nature-oppo- sites are truly indistinguishable. They have no separate exis- tence, for in this Power opposites dissolve in union, so that the distinctions we see in nature are only illusory. Thus, dvandva embraces the union of, for example, opposites like fire and water, knowledge and nescience, darkness and light, death and immortality, male and female (fig. 1). Hinduism, however, has always existed at two levels. On the one hand are the profound ancient philosophies, compre- hended by a few, on the other the popular mythologies of the vast majority, who have injected the core idea of dvandva- namely, that phenomenal manifestations are but transient, TABLE 2 VARIATIONS IN PAIRINGS OF Naksatra AND PRESIDING DEITIES IN REPRESENTATIVE RELIGIOUS WORKS (After Kirfel 1920, modified to include presiding deities) Atharva Veda Kd(haka-Saihhitd Maitrdyani-SaMhitd Taittiriya-Sanhhitd Taittiriya-Brdhmana Tailiriya-Brahmana XIX.7.1 ff.; 8.2 ff.

To avoid confusion, however, the text employs modern renditions of the appellations. 548 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA indistinct, and ultimately one-into their conceptualization of the attributes of deities. Hence, Hindu iconography, which reached maturity largely in the early post-Christian, Puranic era, assigns certain symbols, such as animal mounts, orna- ments, and gestures, to the images of deities. These devices permit one to visualize and identify deities who personify fire, disease, wealth, etc. While these personifications also prevailed in the earlier mythologies of the Vedas and the Brahmanas, the influence of dvandva in these literary works is apparent in the far less rigid conceptualization of divine attributes than is occasioned by the icon maker's dependence on visual sym- bols. For example, Agni, who personifies fire, is not merely the "god of fire" as Kelley leads us to believe. Agni also embodies principles which, in the mythical, popular sense, are assigned to other deities. Agni, like any other Vedic deity, is Brahman, the transcendental essence, and is ultimately indistinguishable FIG. 1. Ardhanarigvara, a personage representing the fusion of male and female principles, of the god 8iva and Uma, an aspect of his consort the goddess Parvati. The sculpture expresses the archaic philosophical concept of dvandva, the union of opposites, as much as it portrays a mythical Puran)ic figure involved in the ceaseless battles between the gods and the asuras (antigods). 12th century A.D., Khiching, Orissa. (Photograph courtesy of the Archaeological Survey of India.) from other deities. Though a "fire god," Agni is equally Vayu, the "wind god," or Apah, the water deities, or Sfirya, the "sun god," or Nirrti, the "goddess of suffering and death," or any one of the other deities. The union of wholly unrelated divine attributes is exemplified in compound appellations like Ag- nisoma and Indragni and dualities like Soma-Piisan, Vayu- Savitr, and others. In addition, all of the other "individual" deities listed by Kelley have flexible, interchangeable attri- butes, as described by Dandekar (1942), Desai (1967), De- vasthali (1965), Gajendragadkar (1965), Godbole (1965), Gonda (1974), and Sharma (1960). There is no evidence whatsoever that a pantheistic outlook of the kind just described ever existed in Mesoamerica. Nor does it seem remotely likely that these exceedingly complex Hindu ideas were transplanted there and then modified into forms now unrecognizable. Anders (1963) lists seven pairs of deities from the Popul Vuh of the Quiche Maya, a very late work showing Christian influences, but these are all under- world gods of destruction and resemble not at all the celestial, Hindu, dvandva deities. A few pairs of Aztec day gods (Nos. 3, 6, 9, 17) occur in Kelley's list, but, as we will see, they hardly resemble the Hindu deities. A class of particularly noteworthy resemblances has to do with the suggestive power of contradictory natural phenomena. An example is the Aztec metaphor of "burning waters" (Se- journe 1957:112). In almost identical Hindu metaphors, the waters (Apah) are said to spring from fire (Agni), and bhasma, or fiery ash, is synonymous with Agni in contexts of its union with the waters ("?ukla" Yajur-Veda Samihitd, adhyaya 12). Garibay (1959) sees "similarities" between Hindu and Nahuatl notions of space and time. He compares the philosophical speculations of the Upanisads (ca. 660-550 B.C.), in which the mythical roles of the deities are ignored or subordinated, with the largely mythical Mesoamerican notions recorded in Codex Borgia, a rather late work datable perhaps to the mid-2d millennium A.D. (cf. Glass 1975:11-13). Garibay is properly careful, however, to avoid any deductions regarding the origins of the Mesoamerican ideas. These cases deserve special men- tion only to underline the fact that notions of dual divinities or metaphoric unions of opposites are not a Hindu monopoly. They have been independently envisioned, but at other levels of abstraction or of artistic interpretation, by such diverse peoples as the Chinese, African tribes, and the Ngaju of South Borneo (Scharer 1963). With this brief background, we may proceed to examine a few specific frailties in the "parallels" drawn by Kelley be- tween the attributes and sequential positions of the deities presiding over the naksatra, on the one hand, and those of the Maya-Aztec day names and deities, on the other. The follow- ing discussion will be clearer if one refers frequently to table 1. Kelley aligns Aztec Day 8, Tochtli (rabbit), connected with the goddess Mayauel of the moon and of drunkenness, along- side the Hindu Soma (No. 3), whom he incorrectly refers to as "god of liquor." The facts are that the rabbit is hardly Soma's characteristic animal attribute or inebriation exclu- sively his vice. The intoxicant called soma, probably a hallu- cinogen extracted from an agaric, is a weakness of all the Vedic deities, who delight in this so-called moon-plant juice. The god Indra (No. 14) is linked with it in particular. Indeed, in the Sdma Veda Samihitd (1.1.1) it is not Soma, but Agni, who initially is glorified as the consumer of this "inebriating delight," and the same text glorifies Indra (No. 14) as its principal user, "who delights in quaffing it [and for whom it] is expressed and . . . strained out pure." Kelley resurrects a minor myth which identifies the shadowy figure in the moon as that of a rabbit, but the frog qualifies equally for attention, as the metaphorical caricature of the moon candram jighrksuth Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 549</page><page sequence="10">(Sanskrit: [the frog] "croaking at rainclouds") suggests. In yet another myth, the dark spot was made by a priest, but in this case it is Indra who is called the moon (Hopkins 1915:89, 135). Kelley aligns the Aztec Day 15, Quauhtli (eagle), not with Soma, Indra, or Agni, all of whom have pronounced mythic associations with the eagle (Macdonell 1963:63, 89, 112, 152), but with Tvastr (No. 12), who has none. One might over- look this in order to accommodate Kelley's desire to match Tvastr's title "Chief of Craftsmen" with the Maya Day 15 attribute "Master of All the Arts," but here, too, one is per- plexed. This title precisely and more appropriately befits Rudra (= giva, No. 4) in his aspect as daksinamurti; and it is this god, rather than the archaic Vedic Tvastr, whom the Hindus even today revere as master or lord of the arts. An alignment of Rudra with Maya Day 15 would seem equally, if not more, appropriate. The eagle and the vulture have distinct associations with three days (Nos. 15, 16 and 20) in the Mesoamerican calen- dars, but Kelley selectively aligns the Maya Day 20, Ahau, with the naksatra Abhijit (No. 20), stating in his text (p. 161) that "Abhijit . . . for the Hindus was Vega and two neigh- boring stars in Lyra; another Hindu name for Lyra was 'vul- ture.'" As authority he cites Allen (1899:282), who, in fact, equates Lyra with "eagle or vulture." However, this inconsis- tency must be explored further. One should be aware that Sanskrit vocabulary (Apte 1890:562b, c; 465a; 1969:126) clearly distinguishes the eagle (garutmat or utkrofah) from the vulture (grdhrah or dak.syyah). Furthermore, dAkfsyanf, a cognate of the Sanskrit word for vulture, loosely used, could mean any one of the naksatras, but is used specifically in refer- ence to Revati (No. 26). Thus, Kelley's alignment of Abhijit (No. 20) with the Maya Ahau, with its attribute of eagle, is not convincing. In addition, the god Brahma, who presides over Abhijit, has neither the eagle nor the vulture, but a celes- tial goose, the hamsa, as his mount. Kelley aligns the Maya and Aztec day names symbolized by death with the Hindu god Yama (No. 28). It is the Aztec moon god Tecciztecatl (No. 6) who happens to be aligned with Yama, while the logical equivalent, Mictlantecuhtli, the god of death (No. 10) is not. Kelley describes Yama as the god of death. This is partly justifiable and partly not. As Gombrich (1975:129) correctly observes, Yama is the god of death, and he lives in heaven, the opposite of hell, according to the Atharva Veda; the two ideas, his heavenly abode and his frightening character as Death, are not well integrated; in the Mahdbhdrata [good persons] . . . go at death to Indra's heaven rather than to Yama's. . . . worshippers of giva [Rudra] and Visnu believed that after death they might enjoy bliss in the heaven of their god-but these heavens find no place in the con- temporary Purinic cosmology. But to return to Yama; he gradu- ally loses his place as a killer to a personification called Death, and retires to a sinecure in his high heaven. . . . When the good die, they go straight to the world of Indra, whereas the bad go to Yama. The goddess Nirrti (No. 17), Yama's counterpart, and as fearsome, personifies death no less (Bhattacharji 1970:80). Mourners at the important postfunerary obsequies known as frdddha appeal, even today, to Agni and Soma no less than to Yama. In fact, it is Agni who is initially invoked. His name is called in hymnals thrice, Yama's but once and no more ear- nestly than are Soma's, Vayu's, Savitr's, and Nirrti's (Jaimini Grkyasatra II.1; II.2). Yama's messengers of death are pi- geons (not mentioned by Kelley) or an owl, but his most characteristic and regular association is with a pair of dogs (Macdonell 1897: 172-73). Several questions are obvious: Why is Yama singled out for alignment with the Maya-Aztec day names for death when certain other Hindu deities serve equally well? Why, despite their canine symbolism, are Oc and Itzcuintli (Day 10) not aligned with Yama? Why is Vayu (No. 13), who personifies wind, so out of alignment with the Maya Ik and Aztec Ehecatl, Day 2, named after the wind? Why is the Maya-Aztec Day 19, Cauac or Quiahuitl, symbolized by storm or rain, aligned with the Hindu water deities Apah (No. 18)? Why not with Indra (No. 14), whose quite subordinate role as "prop of heaven" Kelley emphasizes, ignoring that he is also "supporter of earth" and that Indra's well-known primary function is that of producing storms and rain? And why is Mesoamerican Day 19 not aligned with Varuna (No. 23), whose associations with the waters are just as pronounced as Indra's (Gajendragadkar 1965:32)? Is not Soma qualified for alignment with Day 15? Surely, he merits more than the ludicrous title of "god of liquor" that Kelley bestows upon him. Soma's pluvial associa- tion is clear from a hymn in the Sdma Veda Samhitd (adhyaya 13): "O Soma, pour forth to us rain, even floods of water on all sides, in abundance, and large supplies of wholesome food." And why is Prajapati ignored? He is the "fertilizing rain cloud" (Joshi 1972:103). Chuen and Ozomatli (monkey), Day 11, do not align with Indra. Why not, considering the stress Kelley places on the significance of the monkey (p. 165), when the monkey is "Indra's favorite" (Macdonell 1963:151; Law 1965:35)? Cipactli ("earth crocodile"), Aztec Day 1, has been aligned with the Vasus (No. 22), Hindu "earth gods"'in Kelley's list, but he also considers an eventual revision, stating (p. 159) that "there are good arguments for my original alignment and for this readjustment . . . [which] would put the 9 Vasus oppo- site Quetzalcoatl, who was, as I hope to show, the leader of the 9 gods of America." Here it must not be overlooked that the Vasus are not nine, but eight, in number and that the San- skrit word itself connotes "eight." These eight deities personify natural phenomena-pole star, moon, earth, wind, fire, dawn, light, and water-hardly justifying their characterization as "earth gods" (Apte 1890:953; Gopinatha Rao 1914, vol. 2: 552). As for the realignment of the Vasus with Quetzalcoatl, is not this "feathered serpent" more appropriately alignable with Visnu (No. 21)-a solar deity whose primary attributes are the cosmic serpent and the celestial bird? Considering the historical and iconographic developments of the "earth-crocodile" Cipactli of the Aztecs and of the makara of Hindu-Buddhist art, I cannot elaborate upon these aspects beyond making comments of immediate relevance. In neither case does it seem justifiable to point to the crocodilian nature of these mythic creatures without reference to the period and provenance of specific iconographic representations. In each case the prototypes may be crocodilian, but, artistically, they are highly stylized hybrids in which ophidian and piscine ele- ments also blend in differing degrees. The makara is exclu- sively aquatic and purely a creature of fantasy. Essays on the iconology of the makara (Coomaraswamy 1929, Vogel 1929- 30, Viennot 1954) make it clear that this creature may assume various forms, including that of a mammal-like hybrid with a proboscis resembling an elephant's and feet like those of a rhinoceros. In the earliest artistic renditions, it is pisciform and scaly. Occasionally shown with a "serpentine" body, the makara is almost never depicted as possessing the uniquely ophidian characteristic of a bifid tongue. By contrast, depic- tions of Cipactli which emphasize this feature, even in croco- dilian heads, are common (Beyer 1965:201-202, figs. 138-40; Seler 1960-61, vol. 4: figs. 654-63, 665-68). Cipactli may also be depicted with a serpent's head or as a fish (see fig. 2). The correspondences, both on developmental and artistic cri- teria, for Cipactli and makara do not justify a genetic rela- tionship permitting Kelley's alignment of the Vasus with Maya-Aztec Day 1. This is because (a) none of the eight Vasus has a makara mount; (b) the makara is primarily the mount of Ganga, a riverine goddess not involved in the nak- 550 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">satra series; (c) Yama, the god of death, is identified with the makara (Visnudharmottara-Purdna III.54); (d) Varuna, the deity of the waters, also has the makara as his mount (Agni-Purdna LI.5); and (e) Kama, the god of love and en- snarement, who in certain naksatra lists supplants Tvastr (No. 12) as presiding deity, may have either a fish (gdraddtilaka Tantrami XVII.120) or a makara (Sivaramamurti 1942:90) as his mount and banner emblem. Cipactli, says Kelley (p. 165), "corresponds in sequential position to goat-fish (Capricorn) of the Near East, known to the Hindus as makara"! On the contrary, the Hindu zodiacal period of Makara (December- January) corresponds to the lunar month of Paugya and to the naksatra Punarvasu and Pu?ya (Ketkar 1923). Thus, Kel- ley's statement would require moving Cipactli alongside the deities Aditi and Brhaspati (Nos. 5 and 6), far from its present position in table 1. Clearly, Kelley could have availed himself of any one of these conflicting alternatives, but he ignores them all without telling us why. Kelley calls attention (p. 176) to his alignment of "the Aztec cipactli also with the lunar minsion Sravana [No. 21] because an alternate Hindu name for this constellation was Acvatta, the Sacred fig tree." He continues, "Compare the previous discussion of Tree/Vulture association which rather tends to align gravana with Ahau. Perhaps the vulture was supposed to be in the crocodile tree as on page three of the Dresden Codex" (italics mine). Analogies of this kind only beg the question why Kelley does not align Cuetzpalin (liz- ard), Aztec Day 4, with the naksatra Jyestha (No. 16), since the Sanskrit cognate jyesthi translates precisely as "lizard" (Apte 1890:519b). Or, as an alternative, might one not align Jyestha with Maya Cauac (storm), Day 19? As a personifica- tion of the storm or rain, we have in the Maya Chac a probos- cidiform deity who qualifies strongly as a parallel to Jyesthi, for this naksatra, too, is named after a "long-nosed" goddess bearing the epithet hastimukhd, literally "elephant-faced" (Banerjea 1956:382). Ophidian symbolism occurs in both the Mesoamerican and Hindu lists. In view of the cultic importance of the serpent Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA in these civilizations, Day 5 Chicchan and Coatl (serpent) are obviously misaligned with the A.vins, the Hindu presiding deities "the twins" (No. 27); these have no ophidian attributes whatsoever. Presumably, Kelley's reason is that coatl also means twins. It seems to me that he has ignored the more important fact that the primary pre-Nahuatl symbolism of the serpent in Mesoamerica is pluvial and cosmological. As a re- sult, two major Hindu ophidian deities, Ahi and Ahi Budhnya (No. 7 and 25), plus the important god Visnu (No. 21), whose symbol is the serpent of the cosmic sea, are out of alignment. Any one of these ophidian presiding deities with pronounced aquatic associations is clearly a more reasonable parallel to Mesoamerican Day 5 than are the AMvins. Kirchhoff's (1964a) alignments seem to me as hollow as Kelley's, since they are susceptible to exactly the same type of questioning. These authors disagree radically in their match- ings of the Aztec sequences and the naksatra deities-a mea- sure of the absence of any clear-cut similarities among them and of the artificiality inherent in inferences based on at- tempts to correlate uncorrelatable data. Kirchhoff draws spe- cial attention to his lists, stating that they are "without interruption" while reminding us that Kelley's "operates with interrupted sequences." The net effect, however, is no more convincing than Kelley's. In Kirchhoff's table 2, Soma is "the home of the dead," Durga "the goddess of death and destruc- tion," Visnu "the god of fertility," Apah "the mothers of fire," Vayu "the bringer of rain," and Indra "the god who destroys when drunk with soma"! These descriptions range from partly true to incorrect. Furthermore, Agni and Xiuhtecuhtli, though each personifies fire, are far out of alignment. So are Yama and Mictlantecuhtli, who personify death. Kirchhoff, like Kelley, also compares the calendrical animals of the Aztecs with the animals associated with the Hindu deities, but, again, their disagreements are sharp. Calling atten- tion to its novelty, Kirchhoff produces a list of 27 animals, each of which symbolizes a naksatra. It is important to realize (&lt;. LYAk C ',~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~tt '~ -1- FIG. 2.

That it contains 27, not 28, animals would instantly characterize it as archaic and cer- tainly Vedic, but this is highly improbable, as we will see. On the other hand, his presiding-deity sequence betrays archaic traits, since it begins with Agni, i.e., corresponds to Krttika as mukham. To aid the reader in drawing his own conclusions by com- paring Kirchhoff's and Kelley's animal correlates (from table 1), I have reproduced a visual scheme, rather than a word list, in figure 3. To be consistent with Kirchhoff's animal list, this religious pictogram is intentionally chosen from South India. It depicts various astral symbols and is taken from an anonymous 1835 report. It is of unknown date, perhaps late 18th century, but it will eventually be clear that it reflects ideas originating mostly after about the 12th century A.D. The central 9 squares house the planetary deities, and these are ringed by the 12 zodiacal symbols. Only the sequence of 28 animals in the peripheral segments need concern us now. Kirchhoff's list is identical with this except that he (a) does not account for the absence of animal No. 28, the important makara, especially since his parallel naksatra list has 28 mem- bers; (b) replaces the female goat and the male and female cobras in Segments 3, 4, and 5, respectively, by the "constella- tion Auriga" in each; (c) replaces the male goat in Segment 8 by a male buffalo; and (d) replaces the fox in Segment 21 by a lioness. One should note that the horse in Segment 1 initiates the sequence by symbolizing the naksatra AMvini. In Kirch- hoff's animal alignments, the horse corresponds to the rabbit (Tochtli, Aztec Day 8) via Mayauel, the Aztec deity whom he aligns with the Hindu presiding deity Brahma (No. 20 in table 1). Kelley, on the contrary, aligns Brahma very differ- ently-with the eagle or flower, Maya and Aztec symbols for Day 20, corresponding to the Aztec deity Xochiquetzal. 2 ~~~367 8 12 ? 28 9 I 46 27lo 26. 9 ' 1 a 1tt 3?:t* - - 22 21_2 19_ 17 1'15 FIG. 3.

Only 7 out of 27 have animal con- nections: horse's head, cat's paw, snake, dog's tail, boar's head, and fish. Of these, only the horse is common to Kirchhoff's and Kelley's lists. To conclude this section, I should cite the lack of any firm linkage of animal symbolism, presiding deity, and naksatra inter se. I shall draw two examples from the highly structured succession of festal events occurring during the Hindu lunar months. These are named sidereally and have a special asso- ciation with the series of naksatra in that the name of each month is derived from the particular naksatra in which, or adjacent to which, the moon is full in a given month: Yama (cf. table 1) is the presiding deity of the naksatra Bharani, which corresponds to the month of AMvina. Nevertheless, Yama is honored in the month of Karttika-when the two presiding deities are Agni (of Krttika) and Prajapati (of Rohini). The second example is of one of the most important festivals involving an animal, the serpent. The worship of live cobras or their effigies is set for the month of Margagirsa, which corresponds to the nak.satra Mrgagiras, symbolized by a deer's head. It is also more commonly observed in the month of gravana, corresponding to the naksatra Sravani, whose pre- siding deity, Visnu, has a serpent attribute. However, the fes- tival was rooted in India's prehistory long before the ascen- dancy of this god in the early post-Christian era. More significantly, it is not observed in the months of Magha and Bhadrapada, though each, through its naksatra, is linked to an ophidian presiding deity, Ahi and Ahi Budhnya. In addition, the festival of the very important serpent goddess Manasa occurs in Agidha, a month that has no ophidian connotations. Other examples may be deduced from Kielhom (1897). Clearly, the classical, Puranic, and demotic traditions in India are replete with variations of the kind I have noted. Unless one is intent on detecting "similarities," the utilization of a few imprecisely presented items of information as data can be hazardous. In cross-cultural comparisons involving Mesoamerica, it is even more difficult to justify when little or no specific reference is made by the diffusionists to textual chronology and the cultural history of Hindu-Buddhist India. The. next section, on the symbolism of the planets, illustrates this no less equivocally than the nak.satra. THE NAVAGRAHAH SERIES Efforts to show that there is "good evidence that much of the Mesoamerican calendar system is of Old World derivation" have also depended upon the attributes of a group of nine Hindu planetary deities known as the navagrahdh. Kelley (1972) and Barthel (1974, 1975a) describe what they believe to be correspondences between these deities and a group of nine Mesoamerican "Lords of the Night." These are known from glyphs pertaining to a lunar sequence (Glyph G) origi- nally deciphered by Thompson (1929). The correspondences claimed, in my opinion, are no more persuasive than those adduced from the naksatra system and susceptible to much the same lines of counterargument. I wish to point out only a few of the many facets overlooked by Kelley and Barthel. As the foundations for their alignments are essentially alike, -I will discuss Barthel's view less extensively than Kelley's, though there are grounds for an ampler consideration of spe- cific weaknesses in his arguments. The nine Lords of the Night represented on Maya monu- ments can be traced back to at least A.D. 322, the date borne by the important jade relic termed the Leyden Plate, described in detail by Morley and Morley (1939). It must be stressed that the glyphs and the elaborately costumed figure engraved Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA (~~~~~~~~~~~ a . L.. .;.f... a.

(Re- printed courtesy of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.) on this relic (fig. 4) are executed in the Proto-Classic Maya style and that it constitutes the earliest surely dated hiero- glyphic record of the nine Lords. Thus, the possibility exists that these nine Maya personages were conceptualized several centuries earlier. Little or nothing seems to be known about their evolution. By contrast, Hindu ideas about the planets and the deities personifying them emerge clearly in the literature of quite early periods. To the sun and the moon (which were regarded as planets) were added Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn to yield a complement of seven. The chronological de- velopment of their divine symbolism need not detain us, for it long precedes the period of trans-Pacific culture contacts between India and Mesoamerica pictured by the diffusionists. Of greater relevance is the fact that an eighth member, Rahu, originally known as Svarbhanu, a demoniacal asura (antigod) who causes eclipses, is a late addition. When Rahu is first en- countered, in the Atharva Veda (XIX.9, 10), it is in connec- tion with the sun. The literature of the Epic period, such as the Rdmdyana (ca. 400 B.C.), continues the older planetary beliefs. The important astronomical treatise composed in A.D. 499, the Aryabhattiya (III.15, 16), mentions only seven planets, omitting Rahu entirely.3 The latter's rise in impor- tance, therefore, was rather tardy and occurred only after or during the 7th century. Banerjea (1948:100; 1956:444) states that no more than eight planetary divinities, Rihu included, 3 The influence of Aryabhatta, its author, was so great throughout India that "well nigh every one of the scores of astronomical [and astrological] works produced in Kerala follows the Aryabhattiya basically" (Sarma 1972:6). This circumstance is noteworthy be- cause of the importance of southern India in the history of Hindu migrations overseas, as the later sections of this essay will amplify.

(From the Narapatijayacarydsvarodaya [A.D. 11701, pp. 132, 207.) occur in the Grahayagapatta, a text of the 8th to 9th centuries A.D. The full complement of nine, the navagrahdh, was attained with the addition of Ketu-an event most likely to have occurred in the late 9th or 10th century. In Orissa, the Indian province whose ancient seaport of Palura connects it with the period of Hindu cultural expansion in Southeast Asia, the temples of nearby Bhuvane9vara4 have no sculptural repre- sentations of Ketu until the Ganga dynasty (A.D. 1076-1586). The Muslim chronicler al-Biruni recorded in about A.D. 1030, during his visit to India, a note on a mythic serpent whose head was called Rahu and whose tail Ketu (Sachau 1910, vol. 2 :234). However, this notion seems to have been neither widespread nor important in the art, astronomy, and religion of even the two preceding centuries. At the important mid-7th- century Para?urime?vara temple at Bhuvane?vara, the prin- cipal lintel at the entrance to the inner sanctum depicts only eight grahah, including Rahu but excluding Ketu. The first mention of Ketu in an astrological-numerological context occurs in the Narapatijayacaryasvarodaya by Narapati (d. A.D. 1176), a Sanskrit text in part devoted to rites for propitiating the planets and the naksatra. Rahu (p. 118, verses 11-15) is here caricatured as a serpent, and his tail is termed Ketu. Thus Rahu-Ketu is a single entity, and he is associated with the 27 naksatra (fig. 5a) more pronouncedly than with the other grahah. Narapati refers far more frequently to Rahu than to Ketu, and a similar predilection persists even in later reli- gious-astrological works like the Muhurtacintdmani of Ramadai- vajnia (A.D. 1600) and in the very comprehensive survey of the history of Hindu astrology by Diksit (1931:163, 166, 170, 184, 200). All three authors, among others, emphasize five, seven, or eight grahah and/or the naksatra, often ignoring Ketu. It is clear that Ketu's astrological status is rather subordinate and that it was tardily derived from comets and meteors, for he is referred to in the plural in at least two Sanskrit texts reproduced by Gopinatha Rao (1914, vol. 1: appendix C, 97). In the mid-6th century, Varahamihira's Brhat-Sathiita (XI.7- 28) listed 1,000 ketu, naming 32 of these meteors or comets as the malefic sons of Rahu. Discussion of additional information is deferred. To sum up: Rahu gains prominence not much before the 8th century A.D. and Ketu not much before the mid-lOth.5 By this time, each bears the fictitious appelation graka, "planet," and represent the ascending (Rahu) and descending (Ketu) nodes of the moon. Their enhanced status is built upon (a) an early, Vedic reputation of Raihu as a malefic demon of eclipses; (b) the eventual metaphorical superimposition of a serpent's evil character upon Rahu; and (c) the abrupt as- similation of Ketu into the group of planetary deities to repre- sent the tail half of a serpent's severed body-an assimilation perhaps inspired by the analogy of a comet's or meteor's tail. These relatively late visualizations acquire greater meaning when they are related to a myth: Rahu, the anthropomorphic demon, has obtained by stealth the elixir of immortality and is apprehended by Visnu-but only after he (Rahu) has drunk a drop of it. Visnu cuts off Rahu's head before the elixir descends his gullet. This episode simultaneously explains (a) the withering away of the headless part of his body (repre- sented by Ketu, as the descending node of the moon); (b) the immortality of the head, which pursues the moon cease- lessly for its store of elixir and, vengefully, the sun (an aspect of Visnu), occasionally even succeeding in catching up with them and swallowing them-thus causing eclipses; (c) the astrological usefulness of these symbols of malevolence; and (d) the occasional, though by no means exclusive, iconographic characterization of Rahu and Ketu as partly ophidian in bodily form. It is important to remember this last point, for both Kelley (1972:60, 66) and Barthel (1975a:49) make much of ophidian symbolism. We will soon see that this is remark- ably inconstant, so that the ophidian simile derived from the myth of the decapitation of the anthropomorphic demon Rahu cannot be stressed unduly. Indeed, nowhere does Narapati, 4 Panigrahi (1961) and Fabri (1974) discuss dates and other de- tails of the Bhuvanegvara group of temples. 5 The perennially avid Hindu interest in astrology has occasioned a recent book, Uttar Kdldmrta (1976), in Sanskrit, with commen- tary in modern Hindi. Ketu is mentioned on p. 167. The original text is said to be the work of "Kavi [poet] Kalidasa"-a name certain to enhance the book's commercial prospects. However, one must not confuse this author with his illustrious namesake, the poet-dramatist who, according to some Indian scholars, flourished in the 1st century B.C. (Others argue that he lived from A.D. 240 to 300 [Ketkar 1955].) In any case, his surviving works certainly are not centered upon astrological or astronomical themes. The Ydjfiavalkya-smrti [Acdradh., XII.295], composed between A.D. 100 and 300 (Kane 1930, vol. 2, pt. 1: p--xi), mentions ketu, presum- ably in the same sense as in the Brhat-Sarhitd, i.e., as meteors or comets. 554 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA Ramadaivajfia, or Diksit refer to Rahu and Ketu as the severed head and tail of a serpent. These observations provide a minimal background for testing Kelley's (1972:63) belief that "the Indian evidence throws a good deal of light on the Mesoamerican sequences and strongly indicates that the list of nine planets was borrowed from India." With this assertion he generically allies the navagrahdh not only with the nine Maya Lords of the Night, but also with certain Zapotec and Aztec deities that he regards as equivalent to the Maya G series of nine lunar hieroglyphs. Some of these equivalences may not be acceptable to Mesoamericanists, and Kelley (1972:53-54, 59) himself speculates when accounting for certain obvious discrepancies. From our viewpoint, the pivotal focus is on the nine Maya glyphs and the nine Aztec, rather than the little-known Zapotec, deities. The most decisive argument against linking them with the navagrahah should by now be apparent: How could the Maya complement of nine Lords, whose existence can be traced back to at least A.D. 322, possibly be akin to the Hindu planetary deities when the eighth and ninth members of this series were not added earlier than about the 8th and 10th centuries A.D. respectively? Indeed, as we have seen, Ketu, unlike Rahu, had neither mythological nor iconic forerunners. It might seem unnecessary to extend the argument beyond this point. Yet, it is desirable to dispel claims that divine symbolism analogous to the Puranic Hindu is detectable not only in the G series of Maya glyphs, but also in the Aztec pantheon (which is not clearly identifiable before the 14th century) and in the modern calendrical pantheon of the Zapo- tecs from the Loxicha region of southern Oaxaca. These two pantheons may, of course, have early origins and possess some elements inspired by the Maya. Referring to the symbolism of these Mesoamerican deities, Kelley (1972:59) asserts that "there are some striking simi- larities with the Hindu sequences." This inference is founded on numerous errors of interpretation of the Hindu material, including the emphasis of minor points and the dismissal, perhaps unwitting, of very significant alternatives. Dowson (1968) and, especially, Mackenzie (n.d.), whom he cites in- ordinately, are, as we shall see, quite unreliable. The informa- tion attributed to al-Biruni, the l1th-century Arab chronicler, has inherent limitations and is sometimes complicated by errors on the part of his translator and interpreter Sachau (see Shas- tri 1974:332 n. 17). The foundations of Kelley's speculations, however, are enfeebled chiefly because the original, key sources of Hindu traditions and authoritative commentaries on them have been neglected. That Hindu and Mesoamerican divine symbolism have little or nothing in common will be apparent from table 3, which shows the iconographic traits of the navagrahah as described in a few representative texts. The data are abbreviated from the original. Only the most important identifying features are retained with sufficient completeness to reveal the range of variation that precludes alignments based on delineations of similarities. For ease of comparison, Kelley's (1972: table 1) tabulated alignments are reproduced without changes at the bottom of table 3. The data speak for themselves-for in- stance, the wide discrepancies in, even absence of, presiding deities connected with the navagrahdh, deities whose charac- teristics form the basis of Kelley's sequences. In addition, there are a number of inconsistencies which cannot be brought out through tabulation. I shall enumerate a few of these: 1. "The most obvious" of the "striking similarities with Mesoamerican sequences" (p. 59)8 is said to be that of the seventh Hindu graha, Sani (Saturn), and its regent Prajapati, with Maya G7. The basis of this statement is that Saturn is also the seventh planet in both the seven-day and nine-day weeks of the Maya. Now, it should be stressed that the custom of regarding Sunday as the first day of the week and Saturday (Day 7, Saturn) as its last day was adopted in India considerably later than A.D. 322, the earliest known date of the Mayan lunar G-glyphs. Kelley's homologizing of gani and G7 is inadmissible for the simple reason that it transgresses the methodological requirement of coevality. For the Hindus, the order of the planets, at least up to the beginning of the 6th century A.D., was Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon. This order was consistent with the ancient conception of the universe as geocentric, whereby these bodies were reckoned to be successively at decreasing distances from the earth owing to the "apparent" increases in their orbital speeds. The Hindus regarded each day of the week as being under the regency of a different graha (Rahu and Ketu excluded) according to a cyclical sequence beginning with Saturday. The Aryabhaf.tya (III.15, 16) reveals that gani (Saturn), at least up to A.D. 499, was accorded position No. 1, and not 7, when speaking of both the order of the planets and their regencies during the week. This convention, then, persisted in India for almost two cen- turies after the date engraved on the Leyden Plate. The archaic sequence indicated above, excepting only for the inter- changed positions of Sirya (Sun) and Guru or Brhaspati (Jupiter), is occasionally encountered even as late as the 12th century (see fig. Sb). An additional impediment in equating G7 with Sani is posed by the Tantric traditions of Hinduism. These originated quite early in India, though exactly when is not known. Their popu- larity, especially in eastern and southern India, dates back to A.D. 600 at least and continued strongly up to the 14th century. They are well known to have diffused to China, Indonesia, and Cambodia. Tantric representations of the images of the grahah or their symbols follow a circular pattern, the Sun being ac- corded a central position.

Is not an alignment with G9 equally justified for these very reasons? In Kelley's scheme, Sani's presiding deity is specified as Prajapati. He is interpreted, on the authority of Mayrhofer, as "Lord of Creatures"-a dubious categorization, considering the nature of the Vedic deities, for Prajapati applies equally to Su]rya, to Visnu, to Agni, to Savitr, and to Vi?vakarman (Apte 1890:730b; Joshi 1972:106; Sharma 1960:350,354-55), thereby further disrupting the alignment of Sani with G7, Mbaz, and Tepeyollotl. The latter two Mesoamerican deities are stated to have an "impressive correspondence" (p. 59) to Sani because each bore the title "Lord of Animals." This, however, transliterates precisely into the Sanskrit pafiupati, well known as the epithet of the god Rudra-Siva and a title conventionally applied to the latter, rather than to Prajapati or any other deity (Apte 1890:688b; Gopinatha Rao 1914, vol. 1:399). 3. The view that "the Mesoamerican sequences strongly indicate that the list of nine planets was borrowed from India" (p. 63) impels Kelley to make a statement (p. 64) regarding "the Hindu nine-day week." This error is repeated in his table 1, which lists the navagrahdh in a column entitled "India. Nine planets in day-name order." These are astonishing state- ments because the Hindus, unlike Mesoamericans, have never included more than seven days in their week. Rahu and Ketu, of course, are neither day names nor personifications of any day of the week. They play no part at all in the reckoning of time. Their significance is purely astrological (and not, as Kelley [p. 58] believes, partly "theological and scientific"). Their imaginary celestial positions are normally relatable to the naksatra under which one is born and also to the "real" planets, which, together, are believed to influence personal destinies. Treatises like the Jyotisa-sdra illustrate this un- equivocally. The diversity of Hindu beliefs that frustrates any comparison with the Mesoamerican calendar may be gauged from the precepts of the Bhdgavata-Purana. It is among the most exalted of the Puranas, to the extent that it is worshipped in many Hindu homes. Its section on the planets (Skandha V.22-23) makes no mention at all of Rahu and Ketu, but refers to nine orbits around a geocentric earth, personified as Visnu. In cen- trifugal order, these orbits belong to the Sun, the Moon, and then, in a strange departure from convention, Venus followed by Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The eighth and ninth "orbits" pertain to the constellation Rsi (Great Bear) and Dhruva (Pole Star). The presiding deities are mentioned con- fusedly, repeating the epithets of Visnu, or of Brahman, and including new ones like Dhata, Vidhata, and Dharma in addi- tion to Visnu, Indra, Agni, and Prajapati. 4. The 260-day Mesoamerican calendar is unusual enough to have maintained complete independence of Hindu, or any other, calendric influences. An additional feature is worth noting, however, when one compares the time periods under the regency of the nine Aztec Lords and the periods under the regency of the Hindu planets or of the deities representing the latter. The Aztecs, like the Hindus to this day, regarded certain periods as auspicious and others as inauspicious with the dif- ference that, for purposes of divination, each of the nine Aztec Lords was believed to affect the hours of the night, whereas, to the Hindus, each of the planets holds sway over a different day, including the night hours, i.e., a 24-hour day beginning at dawn. Rahu and Ketu are excluded, as no days are named after them. The comparison in table 4 maintains Kelley's sequential alignments of the Aztec deities alongside the navagrahdh, listed in the normal order observed by the Hindus after the mid-6th century A.D., i.e., after the era of Varahamihira. The information concerning the significances attached to the Aztec deities is taken from the Codex Telleriano-Remensis (No- wotny 1961:219) and from Serna (1892:345). There seems to exist no single clear list of good, evil, and indifferent days. These vacillations of the Aztec portents merely illuminate a further contradiction: The portents of the Hindu planets fol- low a convention which has remained extraordinarily immu- table since at least the 6th century, as almost any pertinent text will indicate. Contrasts in the portents listed in table 4 are sharp. One might have expected greater agreement regarding a simple sentiment of great significance to the Aztecs and Hindus alike. It is of particular interest that (a) though the Sun is exalted in both of these cultures, the deities who personify it portend different things: Suirya (No. 1) bodes ill, whereas Piltzinte- cuhtli or Tonatiuh (No. 3) is beneficent; (b) the view that the similarities of Saturn and Tepeyollotl are "the most ob- vious" (p.;59) in the series of alignments is not corroborated here, for Sanivara (Sani's day), as the most evil of the week, is opposite in character to the Aztec Lord's. The obstacles in comparisons of Mesoamerican and Hindu traditions would have been greater if Rahu and Ketu had been included. 5. The self-contradiction in the statement (p. 62) that "Sukra, the ruler of the planet Jupiter, is a name applied to the planet Venus and its regent" is an obvious one. (The error is repeated on p. 59.) Sukra, of course, is the planet Venus and does not share this identity with Jupiter, which is "ruled" by Brhaspati. Sukra is here confused with Sakra, an epithet of the god Indra. The latter is the first-rank presiding deity of Venus and the second-rank one of Jupiter in but one text 558 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA (Sabdakalpadrumah; cf. table 3), though it is not this, but a statement attributed to Dowson (1961:307), which is the source of Kelley's confusion. This has generated a far-reach- ing speculative inference concerning Jupiter: Bhattacharyya (1958:368) is cited (p. 62), though incompletely, as informing us that "Brhaspati, the usual name of Jupiter, is . . . seated on a frog"-an aquatic symbol utilized by Kelley to justify his alignment of Jupiter with the water deities Chalchiuhtlicue of the Aztecs and Ndan of the Zapotecs. What Kelley withholds from us is that Bhattacharyya, in fact, indicates that "Brhaspati.... is seated on a frog or human skull." Should not the latter symbol place Mictlante- cuhtli, Aztec god of death, on a par with Chalchiuhtlicue and Ndan, thereby disrupting the present alignments? 6. The Hindu goddess Gauri is equated (p. 60) with Tlazol- teotl, the Aztec goddess "identified in Sahagun and other early Spanish writers as Venus, patroness of sexual license and of prostitutes, and likewise given a multiplicity of names." This "striking parallel," according to Kelley, derives from Gauri's being an epithet of Devi, the Great Goddess, who possesses a variety of aspects, both benign -and fierce, the latter aspect being propitiated by "bloody sacrifices . . . and indecent orgies." But the fact is that Gauri's aspect is a benign one, so that the reference to Devi is redundant and does not strengthen the parallelism with Tlazolteotl. It is quite doubtful that Indologists would approve of the qualities imputed to Gauri in this way, for, though she is the spouse of Siva, she personifies the eight-year-old virgin: innocence itself (Apte 1890:470e; Gopinatha Rao 1914, vol 2:360). Gauri, furthermore, is alleged to be "the goddess who rules the planet Venus." The source of this assertion is not given, and I have been unable to confirm it despite much effort. I may point out, to the contrary, that Friday-the day of Venus -is reserved for the worship of the goddess Laksmi, who, like Gauri, is a benign aspect of Devi. Gauri, as a rule, is worshipped on Tuesday, a day that belongs to Mars. The cus- tom of planet worship is an ancient one, observed particularly in the month of Sravana, but the worship of Gauri in this context is of very recent origin. Its influence upon Mesoameri- can thought seems most improbable. Any Hindu almanac will furnish details of these customs, and the extremely late his- torical development of some of these has also been noted by others, including Underhill (1921:70, 71). 7. Kelley's quite puzzling identifications (p. 65) of "Vyana" and "Kalmasha" as presiding deities of Soma and Bhauma, respectively, frustrate verification totally. Apte (1890:1022c, 388c) gives the Sanskrit meanings: vyana is no divinity, but merely "one of the five vital airs of the body. . . ." The ad- jective kalmdsa, among other unrelated meanings, describes an obscure form of Agni, who, however, is preempted by Siirya not only in the ?abdakalpadrumah and Matsya-Purana, where Agni's significance is secondary, but also in Kelley's scheme (see table 3). 8. Xiuhtecuhtli, Lord of Fire, first of the nine Lords in the Aztec sequence, in Kelley's view (p. 63), can be equated directly with Agni, "fire," the "god who ruled the Sun in the Hindu sequence [but is] displaced from this alignment." We have seen that Xiuhtecuhtli exhibits hardly any of the icono- graphic features typical of Agni and that the importance of this Vedic god had slipped drastically during the Puranic period. Apart from these facts, which seriously call into ques- tion the homology with Xiuhtecuhtli, Kelley's claim that "Agni, 'fire', rules the Sun, although he is often associated with Mars and Sun himself appears as a deity" (p. 59) must be viewed in correct perspective. That Siurya is simultaneously the sun and the deity that personifies it cannot be disputed, nor that the sun evokes psychological associations of fire or deities representing fire among diver.se culture.s. Hrowever, one must not for^get that in India almost every one of the Vedic deities is solar. The sun is not merely Agni, and not even primarily Agni, as Kelley implies, but bears 108 names drawn from the Vedic pantheon, including every one of the other grahih except Rahu and Ketu. All of these are listed by Pandey (1971:134, 135). Obviously, the homology of Agni with Xiuhtecuhtli is difficult to sustain. One might go farther and contest the assertion that "Agni rules the Sun." It is, of course, Siurya who represents and "rules" the sun. However, in the context of the navagrahah as a group, there is, as far as I have been able to determine after much search, only one source, the Matsya-Purdna (ad- hyaya 93, Nloka 15), which mentions Agni as the presiding deity of the Sun-and then in second rank, subordinate to INvara (= Siva). The Garuda-Purdna (adhyaya 58) names 92 divinities and semidivinities who are directly associated with the Sun during different zodiacal months. Agni nowhere figures in this list. In the Visnudharmottara-Purana (III.69.2), Agni is explic- itly likened to Bhauma (Mars). Should not Kelley have con. sidered aligning this planet, i.e., the god who personifies it, with Xiuhtecuhtli (cf. tables 3 and 4)? 9. Elephantine and ophidian symbolism is given much im- portance in Kelley's Hindu-Mesoamerican comparisons, but, once again, his alignments do not reflect a proper understand- ing of these symbols in religious myths. Much of his confusion may be attributed to his reliance on Mackenzie, a writer of the early 1920s whose "popular" books show few signs of scholarship, not to mention his very poor bibliography. To rectify its inadequacies would be inappropriate here; suffice it to clarify a few points that have engendered erroneous inferences. The association of elephants and serpents with moisture is well known in Indian mythological themes and consistent with the immense popularity of these animals in diverse aspects of Hindu folklore. The word naga signifies both animals, though the literal, and more usual, meaning is "serpent." Both serpents and elephants are symbolically associated with the cardinal directions. Now, "the gods of rain in India," says Kelley (p. 61), "four-fold like the Chacs [of Mexico], were, in fact, elephants." In Kelley's alignments, Tlaloc, the Aztec rain deity with ophidian attributes, is equated with Rahu, whose presiding deity (we are told) is the elephant-headed Ganapati or Gandea. This assertion is not supported by the Hindu literature, but in Kelley's estimation (p. 60) the association of Rahu and Gandea is clear enough because the myths of each involve incidents of decapitation. He apparently does not realize that Soma, who personifies the Moon, is "the essence of water" [Visnudharmottara Purdna III.68.12], the god who, in the Sama Veda Satmhitd (adhyaya 13), is implored to "pour forth to us rain, even floods of water on all sides." Is not an align- ment of Tlaloc (and of the Zapotec rain deity Mdi and Maya glyph G8) with Soma more appropriate than the present pair- ing of the latter with Piltzintecuhtli, the desiccating sun? And why should not Tlaloc be aligned with Sukra (Venus)? The latter's abode, the Matsya-Purana (adhyaya 128, Nloka 53) tells us, is water. Apart from the fact that mythology ascribes rain-making potential to a variety of divinities-including, as we have seen, to Agni, the "god of fire".!-the statement that there are four rain-making Hindu gods who "were, in fact, elephants" or possessed elephant symbols is quite incorrect. Traditionally, the four quarters plus the four subcardinal directions are assigned to eight dig-gajah, or space-elephants, which are paired with eight serpents. These, together, may presage rain, but their significance is primarily spatial. They are under the Vol. 19 * No. 3 *SeA,bfemhr 107R 559</page><page sequence="20">overlordship of eight anthropomorphic deities. Other than Indra, the rain and weather god par excellence, there is no god or goddess in the Hindu-Buddhist pantheon who has both pluvial and elephantine or ophidian associations. Of the "clas- sical" deities connected with water-Parjanya, Apah, Varuna, Ganga, and Prajapati-none is symbolized by an elephant. The goddess Laksmi and the god Ganeda have elephant symbols but no special directional or pluvial significances. The god Visnu has an important ophidian alter ego but is visvaksenah, "omnidirectional" (Apte 1890:1000b). To be specific, the eight directional gods, the astadikpdla, and their animal em- blems are as follows: Indra, white elephant or horses; Agni, ram, occasionally bull; Yama, water buffalo; Siurya, horses; Nirrti (substitutes for Surya), lion or donkey; Varuna, ma- kara; Vayu, lion or deer; Kuvera, normally borne on human shoulders, ram, mongoose, or rarely, elephant; and ITuna (a form of Siva), bull. These deities are easily identified on a pillar (fig. 7) from the temple of Sri Ekambaranath in Kanchipuram, the capital of the Pallava kings (A.D. 600-750) of South India, who, like their "heirs" the Cola- (ca. A.D. 907-1053), exercised great cultural influence in Southeast Asia. It may be of interest to note the variations in two points of iconography that we have touched upon earlier-Agni's two heads and the makara. Varuna's makara mount has in this case an "elephantine" snout and feet that contradict the "crocodilian" nature of this creature of fantasy, which Kelley has likened to the Aztec Cipactli. As regards ophidian symbolism, this has been interpreted imprecisely or exaggeratedly in his comparisons of the Hindu and Mesoamerican sequences. The seven-hooded character of certain serpent semidivinities (pp. 59-60) has been invoked to establish connections between Sani, G7, and the Zapotec god Mbaz. Now, Hindu-Buddhist artistic convention typifies serpent divinities or semidivinities-the ndgas-as possessing seven, five, or three fused cobra hoods, or even a single hood, but this criterion, by itself, does not help one in identifying any particular mythic serpent among the innumerable mem- bers of their tribe. Furthermore, gani has two animal symbols, the serpent and the vulture, and Ketu can claim both (see table 3). The ophidian symbolism of Rahu and Ketu is no more helpful in the alignments than is Sani's. Their serpent charac- ter, as we have seen, gained currency quite late iq history. Nor is this metaphor a rigid one. The lion, the horse, the vulture, the dolphin, and even, on occasion, the wild boar or vardha avatar of Visnu may represent Rahu and Ketu. This last symbolic form is seen in figure 3, in the central portion of the diagram, which depicts each of the navagrakdh seated in a horse-drawn chariot. Rahu and Ketu are anthropomorphic, except for their wild-boar heads, and occur in Segments 8 and 9. By contrast, Rahu is symbolized by a "dolphin" (makara?) and Ketu by a sword in the corresponding segments of the Tantric representation in figure 6. In the well-known nava- grahah temple at Citracala, the images of the planets, in- cluding those of Rahu and Ketu, are represented in phallic form and distinguished from each other only by their order, which is Tantric (as in figure 6), and by the colored cloths draped over each of them (Kataki 1930:368; Tucci 1929). The minor significance attached to the ophidian aspect of Sani, Rahu, and Ketu is exemplified by numerous artistic varia- tions that treat it lightly or ignore it. The navagrakdh group in figure 8 is an example. Here, Rihu is represented by a large head (the ascending node of the moon) and torso terminating :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~N a b FIG. 7.

By contrast, only an isolated head and right arm are prescribed by the Visnudharmottara-Purdna (see table 3). Neither Sani, immediately on Rahu's right, nor the latter per- sonage has a halo of fused cobra hoods. Only Ketu exhibits serpent symbolism. Not only is Ketu not headless, as we might expect him to be on the basis of the myth concerning his origin, but his relatively small visage (descending node of the moon) has a halo of five cobra hoods.7 Mitra (1965:18, 20) describes two sculptures of the navagrahdh which repre- sent Ketu as a female symbolized by a serpent's tail and hood. In the late mediaeval temples at Kathiawad, the lintels at the principal entrances carry images of all the navagrahdh. The shrine at Somnatha-Pattan represents Rahu by only a large, severed human head which is bereft of cobra hoods. Ketu is depicted anthropomorphically from the waist up, but is serpent-bodied from the waist down. By contrast, the shrine at Thin portrays Ketu as a full-bodied anthropomorph, while Rahu is represented exactly as at Somnatha-Pattan (Cousens 1931 :29, pl. 14, 49). In the Ekambaranath temple (Cola sec- tion, ca. 11th century A.D.) at Kanchipuram, southeastern India, I have observed that the images of Sani, Rahu, and Ketu are full-bodied, anthropomorphic, and entirely devoid of ophidian symbolism. One might cite several more inconsistencies in the compari- sons of Hindu and Mesoamerican traditions, but my point has perhaps been made sufficiently. Flaws of much the same kind occur in the writings of Barthel. It would be superfluous to delve further along these lines, for Barthel's schemes of equivalence are built upon an acceptance of Kelley's general position, though they differ in details. Whether the inferences of Kelley concerning the equiv- alences of the G series of Maya glyphs, the Aztec Lords of the Night, and the Zapotec deities are sound or not is for the Mesoamerican specialist to judge. Barthel's treatment of the Hindu material may need separate and more detailed con- sideration. It may not be out of place, however, to dwell briefly on a particular instance in which an extensive web of Hindu-Aztec homologies has been built upon a fundamen- tally weak foundation. The case in point concerns the nine Aztec Lords of the Night as they are depicted in Codex Borgia 14, reproduced here as figure 9 and discussed by Barthel (1974:52-61 and fig. 1). These Aztec deities customarily are identified in bou- strophedonic sequence as indicated by the -numerals supplied. The colors which emblematize these deities are, respectively, red, black, red, yellow, white, yellow, yellow, black, and green. 7 The provenance of this specimen is Kakandighi, in Bengal, a site only about 35 km east of Tamralipti (modern Tamluk), the an- cient port prominent in India's maritime connections with South- east Asia. Every one of the navagrahdh in this specimen, including those not shown in figure 8, has a semicircular aureole consisting of seven lotus petals. Readers should not mistake these decorative devices for stylized cobra hoods, which are clear enough over Ketu's head. 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ . . . Ng .

The futility of such attempts will be apparent, how- ever, from the inconstancy of the trait of color ascribed to the navagrahdh by the different texts listed in tables 3 and 5. Barthel's alignment of the Aztec Lords with the navagrahdh is totally different from Kelley's-in itself an indication of the latitude available if one is intent on detecting correspondences, but no more convincing. In table 5, the Aztec Lords are listed in the sequence assigned to them in Codex Borgia 14, i.e., beginning with Xiuhtecuhtli and ending with Tlaloc. Along- side are listed the navagrahdh in the sequence assigned to them by Barthel (p. 61), consistent only with his own criteria for correspondences, and the colors symbolizing these deities ac- cording to various Hindu texts. The examples given reveal the untenability of Barthel's surmises, which stem chiefly from a single text, the Bodhdyana Grhyasuitra. The oddity of the navagrahdh sequence occasioned by Bar- thel's equivalences is conspicuous in table 5, for it begins with Ketu and ends with Brhaspati (Jupiter), with the remaining planets in severe disarray in between. Now, the order of naming the planets (including the eighth and ninth "astro- logical" grahdh, Rahu and Ketu) is rigidly established by the sequence of the Hindu day names, which are derived from the first seven of them. The immutability of the current Hindu order (which is identical with the European) dates, back at least to the early 6th century. The order of the planets up to A.D. 499, as I have noted, was Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, and Moon.

It differs totally even from the unconventional sequence adopted in ritual antinomianism by the historically significant sects of Tantric Hinduism, whose heyday both in eastern and southern India was between the 4th and 14th centuries. The Tantric mandalas illustrated in figures 3 and 6 are remarkable in that their fields of nine squares offer a precise geometrical parallel to the pictogram from Codex Borgia 14 in figure 9, a circum- stance that neither Barthel nor Kelley has reckoned with. But the discordance in the order of the deities in the Tantric and Borgia pictograms is radical: The Sun (Siurya) initiates the sequence from the crucial center of each mandala. While the mandalas are not read boustrophedonically like the pictogram, there would be discordances even if they were. For example, Suirya, the giver of life, and Mictlantecuhti, the god of death, would remain in identical positions, though they are not paired in Barthel's scheme. Yet another contradictory sequence is shown in figure 10, (East) 7 2 3 0 Eir t~ ~~-4 4 6-1 09 Al ~~~~~~5 OS C+ ~~~~~~~~0 ~~~~~ _~~~~~~A 6 9_ 6___ (West) FiG. 10.

Their locations are different from those in the mandala in figure 6. reproduced from the Devatamuirtiprakaranam (IV.38-39). The Sun, as usual, initiates the series from the center, with the remaining eight grahah conceptualized ritually in the normal post-6th-century order but haphazardly located in the seg- ments of the mandala, as indicated by the sequence of numer- als supplied. In addition, their boustrophedonic order-8, 6, 9, 4, 1, 5, 3, 2, 7-is totally at variance with the normal sequence of the Aztec deities in Codex Borgia 14. Thus, the fundamental basis of Barthel's equivalences, indicated in table 5, is once more contradicted-for Rahu is forced into leader- ship, followed by Sukra (Venus), Ketu, Budha (Mercury), Surya (Sun), Guru (Jupiter), Kuja (Mars), Candra (Moon), and SanaiAcara (Saturn). Barthel's (1974:61) omission of Rahu from the position corresponding to Mictlantecuhtli's in Codex Borgia 14 is par- ticularly odd, considering that the alignments do include Ketu, who joined the Hindu planetary series much later than Rahu. In a more recent article, Barthel (1975a:49) erroneously at- tributes to Varahamihira the recognition, in the 6th century A.D., of Rahu and Ketu as the symbolic nodes of the moon, though, in fact, Ketu's importance, even in astrology, did not clearly crystallize until about A.D. 1170. Varahamihira, it should be emphasized, mentions Ketu neither in his astro- nomical treatise, the Brhat-Sathhitd, nor in his astrological work, the Brhat-Jataka. The former (LIII.3; LXXXV.75) specifies the eight "planets" that are associated with the eight quarters of space, not naming Ketu among them, and the latter (II.1-2 1 ) also consistently omits any reference to Ketu-mentioning Rahu only twice (II.3, 5)-in every context involving the planets. To Varahamihira, as explained above, the ketu were a group of comets or meteors. Barthel (1975a:44), furthermore, seems not to have recognized the subtleties of the generic term ketu and the ideas behind the creation by the Hindus of a non- pantheistic, nonastronomical, purely astrological, personified concept, represented as Ketu. Thus, he advances "Dhuma- Ketu" as an appellation for Agni, the "red" god of fire, to justify his equivalence of Ketu with Xiuhtecuhtli, since the latter's "coloration [is appropriate to] Ketu's position [for] Ketu is dark red or 'black' in India [and] smoke-colored in Bali" (p. 44, translation mine).8 The k in "Dhiuma-Ketu" is wrongly capitalized, however, implying a change of sense through an error which is not committed by Dowson (1968:8), 8 "Farbgebung passt gut auf die Ketu-Position, gilt Ketu doch in Indian als dunkeirot oder 'schwarz,' auf Bali als 'rauchfarben."'

The Aztec Lords of the Night, from the Codex Bologna (Cospi). The lower row represents the symbols of the deities in the upper row. The sequence is identical with that indicated for figure 9. The only symbol remotely suggestive of a Hindu graha (Ketu) is in Segment 6, but it is incompatible with Hindu sequences, conventional or antinomian. the chief authority quoted by Barthel (1975a:58 n. 4) for his assertion concerning Agni's appellation. The primary, literal meaning of ketui is "flag," though it also means "comet," and Agni's appellation is a reference to the symbolic smoke (dhi zma) depicted on this god's flag. Yet, Agni figures only obscurely in our contexts. He is, as far as I know, not a pri- mary presiding deity in the navagrahdh series (though Kelley, without citing the authority, regards him as Suirya's). Icons of this god sometimes include Agni (Pifigala), but as merely one of two minor attendants. Barthel, in my opinion, resurrects Agni and links him with Ketu on artificial, rather than theological or iconographic, grounds. In our contexts, the Sanskrit words dhuimaketu and diimnagraha directly identify Ketu and Rahu, respectively (Apte 1890:423a, 599b). If Xiuhtecuhtli can be likened to Ketu on the basis of color indirectly through Agni, one must remember that red symbolizes Bhauma (Mars) far more con- sistently than it does either Ketu or Agni. Agni is black in the Harivuizis'a (Gopinatha Rao 1914, vol. 2 :522) and is described as kalmdsa, "black," "variegated black and white," "demonia- cal" (Apte 1890:388c)-appellations that are also apt for Sani (Saturn). The Visnudharmottara-Purdna specifies (111.1- 10) that icons of Bhauma "should be made like Agni," i.e., red, except for differences in their chariot emblems. Are not Bhauma and Sani as well qualified as Ketu for alignment with Xiuhtecuhtli, on Barthel's own criterion? The central segment, No. 5, of Codex Borgia 14 houses Mictlantecuhtli. The corresponding segment in Thntric man- dalas, as I have noted, is always occupied by Surya, and not by Rahu, as Barthel's alignments would require. Moreover, Mictlantecuhtli is white. RThu is black and evil, like Sani, according to the Bodhdyana Grhyasiitra (adhyaya 16, sfitra 7, 9, 19) and also Goudriaan and Hooykaas (1971:34-36), on whose work Barthel bases his color comparisons. Barthel's (1974:61) omission of Rahu, therefore, seems inexplicable and is inconsistent with the data at hand. Variations in the form of symbolism are not only a Hindu characteristic; they occur in Mexico as well and damage the diffusionists' comparisons even more. In the Codex Bologna (Cospi), each of the Aztec Lords of the Night is emblematized by a head depicted in profile and by a symbol. These are shown in upper and lower rows in figure 11 in their original linear sequences. They are reproduced from Seler (1960-61, vol. 1:343, 606), who, for convenience, depicts the heads and symbols separately in nine-segmented squares which super- ficially resemble the Codex Borgia 14 arrangement. However, the sequences in the latter and in figure 11 are identical. Now, it must be pointed out that the symbols in figure 11 do not at all resemble those of any Hindu deity that Barthel regards as an equivalent of the Aztec deities represented in this figure. A single exception may be made, though indulgently, for the symbol in Segment 6 on the grounds that the severed lower part of the body recalls the metaphor sometimes applied to Ketu-the "headless serpent" or "serpent's tail." This symbol, however, is preempted by Chalchiuhtlicue, who Barthel has equated with Sukra rather than with Ketu. A second Mexican variant occurs in the Codex Fejervary 44 (fig. 12), which gives prominence to Xiuhtecuhtli, the god of fire. He occupies the center of this unusual pictogram in lieu of Mictlantecuhtli, the god of death, who customarily is as- signed a central position in the squared pictograms of Codices Borgia, Vaticanus A, and others. Once again, the point to note is that Piltzintecuhtli (Tonatiuh), the sun god, is denied this prominence whereas in the Hindu mandalas the sun god Sfirva always holds center stage. The remaining eight Lords in figure 12 occur in opposing pairs in the arms of the Maltese cross, so that a clear-cut comparison with mandalas is impossible. To sum up: Kelley's and Barthel's efforts to match the nine Lords of the Night with the navagrahadh are not persuasive for a number of reasons: the fortuitousness of the bases of comparison, the inaccuracies in, or contradictions to, most of their interpretations, the availability of untested alternatives, the inadequacy or lack of textual and chronological support for their assertions, and, in Barthel's case, an unwarranted disruption of the Hindu planetary sequence. On balance, these 0 -~~~~~~ FIG. 12. The Aztec Lords of the Night, from the Codex Fejervary 44. The central figure represents Xiuhtecuhtli, god of fire, rather than Tonatiuh-Piltzintecuhtli, the sun god. By contrast, Surya, the Hindu sun deity, invariably occupies central position in all Tantric mnandalas and is No. I in post-6th-century-A.D. planetary nomenclature. 564 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA easily outweigh the usefulness of the trivial or superficial detail in the particular examples of divine attributes which these writers adduce as links between the cultures of India and Mexico. THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS A potentially rewarding aspect of cross-cultural anthropology is the search for similarities of traits among racially unrelated peoples who, historically, were separated by seemingly insur- mountable oceanic barriers. If adequate evidences of culture diffusion are not forthcoming, one may still benefit from obser- vations of convergences in artistic creations and religious thought-lessons perhaps ultimately pertinent to an under- standing of the progression of thought in the human family as a whole. By selecting religious criteria, Kirchhoff, Kelley, and Barthel took a commendably different course from the hitherto more usual, but inferentially quite unrewarding, comparisons limited to art or linguistics. I recognize the difficulties of their task and am impressed by their enterprise. However, their efforts, far from yielding evidences of overseas cultural influences in Mesoamerica, only disclose a series of untenable premises and contradictions. How and when these influences may have been exerted is an important part of the picture. Yet, the fundamental premise of Kirchhoff, Kelley, and Barthel-that the deities or symbols of the Mesoamerican calendar are comparable with certain members of the Hindu pantheon-is independently vulnerable to the objection that all three have represented the religious traditions of the Hindus lopsidedly and out of context. The sheer volume of these traditions and their range of variation undermine the validity of the few feeble "correspondences" they have indicated, the more so because they have not con- sidered the incongruous absence of innumerable far more sig- nificant facets of Hindu religious culture of the post-Christian era that one might expect to thrive alongside these "corre- spondences." One is asked to envision the transmission from India, and an easy germination in Mesoamerica, of certain very esoteric divine symbols, whereas the highly popular tradi- tions from the Mahdbhdrata and the Rdmdyana are ignored. The heroes, both divine and secular, who people the pages of these epic compositions were implanted with ease in Southeast Asia. They have their own very complex symbolism and ico- nography as well as direct metaphoric connections with the planets and the naksatra, as Shamasastry (1942) has lucidly shown. There are, in addition, variations in the enormous body of Hindu-Buddhist Tantras, much of whose symbolism also found its way to Southeast Asia. The alternatives that influ- ence interpretation are many, and they impose extremely severe constraints upon Mesoamerican comparisons. Perhaps the most notable weakness in calendrical hypotheses of culture diffusion has to do with textual chronology from the centuries of the Vedas, through those of the Saffhitas and Brahmanas, to the Puranas and the Upapuranas, in a litera- ture which had undergone many variations in emphasis and losses in meanings. Most of the important Vedic deities, for example, the Vasus, Indra, Agni, Tvastr, Apah, and Varuna, are rather obscure in the Puranic age; others like Visnu, Yama, and Ganega-a deity in the ascendant only after the 5th cen- tury-receive more attention than before. In the Rg Veda (IX.66.19-21) and the epic Mahdbhdrata (I.65.39), the moon god, Soma, is closely associated, even identified, with Agni and Yama, but in the post-Epic texts-the very popular Hari- vanXa and the Puranas-Soma's importance is much reduced; he gains a new function as a great warrior (Hanivan'fa 369. 7581 .2382; Hopkins 1915 :93) . The comparisons with Meso- american deities involve little discrimination, if any, of multi- farious, changed roles like these which directly invalidate the "similarities" imagined by the diffusionists. In addition, the archaic naksatra lists in which Krttika was the leading asterism had been abandoned before the mid-ist millennium A.D. Astronomical conceptions of the planetary system were inseparable from propitiatory rituals, known as grahas'anti (Bodhdyana Grhyasutra I.18.1-10) and were over- laid with varied symbols prescribed for the householder by an extensive class of books known as the grhyasuitra. Diffusionists' comparisons seize upon but a very few of the available alter- natives in religious tradition during the long history of Hin- duism-not only some of the Vedic traditions which persisted in the Epic and the Puranic phases, but especially those of the latter.9 By not sufficiently recognizing the many nuances which characterize both esoteric and plebeian Hinduism, by stressing minutiae, by overlooking essential, unifying qualities, they have missed the evolutionary and chronological points of reference so necessary in hypothesizing the migration of Hindu symbols to Mesoamerica. Even if the broader question of cultural transplants is for the moment set aside, it is difficult to see which, if any, of the claims made by Kirchhoff, Kelley, and Barthel is justi- fiable. Adding only a minimum of essential detail, and em- ploying the very same criteria used by them, I have endeav- ored to show specifically why their analogies carry scant conviction. My chief goal has been that of collectively ex- posing the untenability of their hypothesis. I have avoided probing deeper than I need to, at this juncture, into the hol- lowness of many other assertions which all three make in their extensive writings. The need for brevity, for instance, prevents a discussion of Barthel's preoccupation with the nu- merological criterion. He sees meanings in the number of "pearls" worn by Mexican deities, the number of twists in the ropes they carry, and other such matters which, he be- lieves, are sufficient to propose connections between the Hindu and Aztec pantheons. Their conclusions perhaps might have been very different had they surveyed the literature of Hinduism more extensively and analyzed the data more rigorously. Most of the sources they have relied upon are tertiary, at best, and rarely, if ever, is an inference supported by a precise citation of an original Hindu text. Barthel's efforts at quoting scholarly interpreters are noticeably greater, but even he extracts little new Hindu material capable of reviving the fundamentally indefensible position initially adopted by Kirchhoff and Kelley. The former, by explicitly pronouncing upon the "diffusion of a great reli- gious system from India to Mexico," and the latter, by ex- pressing his belief that the Mesoamerican "list of nine planets . . .borrowed from India" follows the navagrahdh sequence and that "much of the Mesoamerican calendar system" is linked to the navagrahdh and naksatra deities, imply much more than is warranted by their very lean bibliographies. Barthel's (1974:48) explicit approval of Kelley's (1972) work is therefore ironic, since his own planetary alignments are totally dissimilar, as are his methods. Is not great caution justified when examining their premises and the reliability of their inferences? Kirchhoff (1964:76 and table 1), for instance, uses a modern "Tamil" list (source unspecified) of calendrical animal sym- bols for comparison with the Aztec sequence of calendrical animals. The former is identical, except for a very few sequen- tial inconsistencies, with another South Indian animal sequence represented in my figure 3, which contains 28 animals. It 9 Specific complications arising from the problem of the chronol- ogy of certain Puranas, their literary style, and the contents linking them to literature of much earlier periods of the Vedas and the Brahmanas are discussed by Altekar (1942). Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 565</page><page sequence="26">would appear that Kirchhoff's also contained an equal number, for his animal sequence corresponds to the modern, Mvinl-to- Revati order of the naksatra. Almost surely, he is oblivious of, or has ignored, the 28th animal, for it is absent in his list. This is the makara, as is clear from my figure 3; but it should be equally clear that this animal cannot be forced into an alignment either with the Aztec Tochtli (rabbit) or Atl (water), as Kirchhoff's scheme would necessitate. By contrast, the naksatra deities listed in his table 2 correspond, though Kirchhoff seems unaware of this, to the archaic Krttika-to- Bharani sequence, which begins with Agni and has Yama as the 28th presiding deity. Allen (1899), an astronomer whom Kelley (1969) fre- quently cites, has a very limited treatment of the Hindu nak- satra and deities, and it includes such errors (p. 366) as calling the god Indra a "sky-goddess." In his 1972 work, Kelley relies upon al-Biruni for information on Hindu astral deities. Al-Biruni's impressions are not unwelcome; however, while the bibliography contains two general reference works and one on Buddhist iconography (which, as noted above, Kelley quotes imprecisely), there is no mention of any primary sources of data to help clarify the evolutionary links between Hindu religious precepts, astral symbols, and iconography. In this work Kelley detects a correspondence between groups of nine Mesoamerican divinities and the nine Hindu "planets." But are we not entitled to know why he is silent about his earlier arguments and promise (1969:159) to show us that Quetzalcoatl, "the leader of the Nine Gods of Mesoamerica," can be aligned with the "nine" Vasus from the naksatra list?10 In a more recent paper (Kelley 1974:136, 142), we are assured that "iconographic evidence directly associated with the calendar [and based on comparisons of] cipactli with makara is most striking and Mesoamerican forms most closely resemble Indian forms of the first century B.C. or slightly later." One might seriously question the diffusionist's rationale for comparing Indian art of this period with that of the Aztecs, whose depictions of Cipactli surely are at least a mil- lennium later. Apart from this, the highly subjective nature of these comparisons is evident from our earlier discussion of these two symbols. Even comparisons of Cambodian with In- dian iconography, of roughly the same period and despite many resemblances, at times pose problems of interpretation. This is true specifically in regard to a group of nine deities whose complete identity with the navagrahdh has been dis- puted (Bhattacharya 1958, Malleret 1960, Mitra 1965, Pal and Bhattacharyya 1969). Thus, the inferences diffusionists make about "the deriva- tion of the Mesoamerican calendar from India" fail partly because of the inadequacy of their methods of comparison and partly because religious precepts cannot be divorced from the art they have inspired. It is odd, too, that diffusionists strive to discover shadowy parallels in divine symbolism when the sacred almanac of 260 days, the most important of the three concurrent calendrical systems of Mesoamerica, is itself totally different from the Hindu. "I see no evidence," says Thompson (1974:83) in a detailed exposition of the Maya calendar, "that Maya successes in astronomy and calendrics owe anything to Old World influences except perhaps for a basic stratum in- troduced, one may suppose, by hunter-gatherers crossing from the Old World via the Bering Strait from 10,000 B.C. onward." The problem of deciding at what initial point the Meso- american calendar, with its series of only 20 named days, should be aligned with the 27 (or 28) naksatra is itself a formidable one, for there is some disagreement as to exactly when the Mesoamerican year commenced (Alvarez Alcali 1972, Caso 1967, Broda de Casa 1969). The Hindu luni-solar religious and astrological year commences, if one overlooks minor regional variations, with the new moon of the lunar month of Caitra. This corresponds to the naksatra Citra and Svati. Hence, Mesoamerican Day 1, Cipactli, might logically be juxtaposed with Tvastr (No. 12 in table 1). An alternative, considering that Caitra is the "windy season," which in India falls in March, is to align Day 2, Ehecatl (wind), at this point. A logical point for Kelley to commence his sequential comparisons might have been to align Aztec Day 2 with the naksatra Citra (No. 1.4). For reasons already given, the very nature of the Hindu deity lists ensures failure of even non- arbitrary alternative alignments like these. To the Hindus, the calendar of paramount importance for sacred events is that based on the naksatra series. Solar time reckoning is used primarily in astrology and as a modem civil convenience. The lunar day, termed tithi, does not necessarily correspond in time to the solar day, for the length of each tithi varies according to the difference between the moon's and the sun's relative positions. The lunar month comprises 16 named tithis, but as it is divided into bright and dark half- months, 14 of these names are common to both halves. Each tithi is associated with a specific deity, and together they fol- low a certain definite order, the details of which are super- fluous here (cf. Mackenzie 1874, Kielhorn 1897). However, excluding the circumstance that Soma (the Moon) is aptly the presiding deity during full moon, only one of the tithi deities (Suirya) is also a deity in the solar, planetary series. Of the other 12 tithi deities, some are absent in the naksatra list; others are common to both lists but follow very different orders. Diffusionists have made no attempts at Mesoamerican correlations for the tithi list, despite its importance, but these, too, are bound to fail. Kelley (1974:139-42) recently reiterated that "the nine- day planetary week of India is composed of the normal Hel- lenistic seven-day planetary week, with the addition at the end of . . . Rahu and Ketu" and that the seven-day week was not introduced into India until between A.D. 40 and the 3d century. Thus, the sequence and symbolism of the Meso- american Lords of the Night allegedly are rooted both in India and in Greece. The origins of solar time reckoning in India are very ancient. The Brahmanas record a period of six days, termed sadhah, five of which made a month. Yet the twelve months are named after the naksatra. Besides the sun and moon, at least Jupiter and Venus were "deified in the youngest portions of the Veda," and all the seven planets were mentioned in the Atharva Veda, during the early 1st millennium B.C. (R3g Veda I.105.10; Kaegi 1886:67; Kamesvara Aiyar 1919:96; Sarma 1976:137, 138, 150)-centuries before the Indo-Greek contacts known to his- tory.1" Ironically, despite the recognized overlordship of the solar days (vdsara or vara) by these planets, the seven days are not named even in the Mahdbhdrata (Das 1928b:503). It is not known precisely when the solar days were arranged in their present weekly order, but Rahu and Ketu have never figured in the computations which gave birth to this arrange- ment. In these computations, each of the seven planetary deities dominates the first hour of his respective day, the in- fluence of the other deities during the same day being regu- lated in an hourly, cyclic, sequential shift, such that the first hour of the following day falls under the dominance of the presiding deity after whom that day is named (Mackenzie 1874:138). Suffice it to say that this hourly sequence involves, 10 Actually, the Vasus are a group of eight deities. 11 Indologists versed in the sacred literature of the Hindus have questioned more than a few assertions concerning the latter's in- debtedness to Greek astronomy. Das (1928a) gives several exam- ples, and Law (1965) reviews the various sources of information. Whether or not this position can be vindicated in specific cases other than the one considered here is irrelevant for our purposes. Shamasastry (1942:139) points out that a conjunction of seven planets, in Pisces, in about 3102 B.C. is implicit in the Rg Veda. 566 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">first, Siirya, then Sukra, Budha, Soma, Sani, Brhaspati, and Bhauma. Whether this system was independently envisioned and dif- fused by the Hindus or borrowed from the Greeks is not the issue here. But Kelley (1972:63-64) states that it is "appar- ently an unintelligent borrowing in which the two planets [Rahu and Ketul were simply added on without understanding that this ruined the entire mathematical basis of the [Helle- nistic seven-day] system" underlying the "Hindu nine-day week." There is, of course, no such thing! Rihu and Ketu not only have no days named after them, but are ignored in the hourly, sequential shifts described above. As for the imagined Mesoamerican homologies, the equivalences, inter se, of the nine glyphs of the Maya G series and the nine Aztec and Zapotec deities are moot. More importantly, there are no grounds for suspecting that these symbols were sequentially arranged in imitation of the hourly shifts of the planetary deities during the seven-day civil week of the Hindus and Greeks. Just when extremely esoteric ideas like the ones we have discussed were allegedly introduced into Mesoamerica is worth examining briefly: Some pertinent problems of navigation and culture change in the trans-Pacific context are discussed by Schneider (1977), and the possible dependence of ancient navigation on astro- nomical knowledge is considered by Baity (1973) and by Kursh and Kreps (1974). That not more than an occasional small band or bands of Hindus or Hinduized Southeast Asians could have been the instruments of culture diffusion is hy- pothesized by the diffusionists themselves. The physical anthro- pological constitution of Mesoamerican aboriginal populations is much too homogeneous (Stewart 1973) to allow a contrary opinion. The immigrants may have been members of deliberate voyages or shipwrecked. Perhaps we should assume that they had little difficulty in transmitting complex beliefs to Meso- american aborigines. We may assume that linguistic barriers filtered out an extremely wide range of simple and utilitarian ideas, though common sense might prompt us to look for traces of these. We may, for the sake of argument, even ignore the important fact that Hindu-Buddhist cultural pene- tration of Southeast Asia was very gradual and entirely pacific. It occurred during at least eight centuries and involved vastly greater numbers of purposeful immigrants from India than may ever have reached Mesoamerica from Southeast Asia. The historical and archaeological facets of Hindu-Buddhist penetration of Southeast Asia are well documented. Coedes (1968:7, 16-17) points out that one passes without transition from the late Neolithic to the first Indian re- mains. On the coast of Viet Nam and in Cambodia, there is nothing between the Neolithic strata of Sa-huynh and Samrong-Sen and the Xuan-16c megalith, on the one hand, and the first monuments of Champa and Cambodia, on the other. The Indian establishments of Oc Eo (in Cochin China) and Kuala Selinsing (in the state of Perak in Malaya), from which come seals engraved with Sanskrit names in the writing of the second to fourth centuries, have also yielded instruments of polished stone. In the Celebes a bronze Buddha of the Amarivati school was found at Sempaga above a Neolithic layer. . . . So we can say, without great exaggeration, that the people of Farther India were still in the midst of late Neolithic civilization when the Brahmano-Buddhist culture of In- dia came into contact with them. There is positive evidence that the Hindus penetrated Cam- bodia in the 1st century A.D. The earliest known Sanskrit in- scriptions are in the writing of the 3d century. The most ancient Hindu archaeological vestiges in Viet Nam are of the Gupta period, ca. 4th century. In Malaya, Sanskrit inscrip- tions do not go back farther than the 4th century. In Sulawesi (the Celebes), Java, and Borneo, the most active contacts with India were in the 4th and 5th centuries. Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA The dilemma of the diffusionists now seems even more obvious. If Hindu voyages to the New World were extensions of those to Southeast Asia, were sporadic, at best, and, to be consistent with genetic and demographic data, involved ex- tremely small numbers of immigrants, the chronological con- tradictions become plain. It is not easy to explain how archaic, intricate features of pre-Puranic Hinduism and the evolved ideas of the Puranic age could each have influenced the Meso- american calendar despite the total absence, in the New World, of Hindu-Buddhist epigraphy and iconography of the kind so much in evidence in Southeast Asia. Here, they are the hall- marks of Indian culture, proofs of the presence of visitors from overseas. In a classic study of Sanskrit in Indonesia, Gonda (1973:70) reminds us that many inscriptions there are written in good and flawless Sanskrit and the numerous tech- nical and more or less literary works . . . show that India's sacred language and literature were highly cultivated. The Mahdbhkrata and Rdmdyana and other Indian cycles and literary works were most popular and have to this day furnished the themes of the shadow play (Wayang) and of large parts of literary production. . . . the Sailendra rulers of Sri Vijaya [Sumatra] derived their religious inspiration especially from Bengal which was in those days [ca. 7th century] the chief seat of [tantra] on the mainland. These Northeast Indian influences were as effectively "im- posed" upon the natives of Sri Vijaya as were the South Indian, for example, the devardja cult, upon the Khmer of Cambodia (Auesrivongse 1976). What proponents of affinities between Hindu and Meso- american calendrical symbolism in effect ask us to accept, not- withstanding its temporal incongruities, is that an abstruse set of Hindu traits had found receptive soil in the New World earlier than A.D. 322-the date of the Leyden Plate-and con- tinued to germinate in the Puranic age under conditions of history and culture interaction wholly different from and un- favorable in comparison with the Southeast Asian. The Maya religion, in the opinion of many Americanists (summarized by Kubler 1969:35-36), was animistic and de- void of a pantheon: "Maya rulers and priests wear emblems and carry signs, but they rarely if ever submit to godly authority.... Classic Maya representations show only instru- ments, costume jewelry, and emblems of office, but never a deity or a god as defined by an overwhelming numen receiving institutional worship." In the Classic period of Maya history, ca. 7th century A.D., the surmised approximate period of Hindu influence in Mesoamerica according to some who rely on artistic criteria alone (Ekholm 1953, Heine-Geldern 1966), not more than three or four numinous personages seem detect- able in Maya iconography, and then not with certainty. It is only in the codices belonging to the very late phases of Maya culture, coinciding with the Spanish penetration of Mexico and Guatemala, that we have proof of a Maya pantheon (Anders 1963). Its comparison with the Hindu is irrelevant from the perspective of culture diffusion. How, then, can one envision the Maya extracting a very few foreign symbols, without knowledge of the labyrinthine Hindu pantheon or its fickle astral associations, and then grafting these in the "right places" upon an incompatible indigenous calendar consisting of 260 days? The roots of this calendar surely lie in the pre-Christian era (Caso 1967:143-53). The subtleties of diffusionists' reasoning are rather obscure to me for these reasons: Their schematic constructions are erected on the premise that, in the wake of trans-Pacific voy- ages (presumably involving very small numbers of immigrants, as everyone seems agreed), certain complex calendrical systems and strange symbolic values might be expected to have taken root in Mesoamerica and flourished. Actually, the 260-day calendar has certain very basic features which cannot be found Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 567</page><page sequence="28">in systems outside America. It is pan-Mesoamerican to a de- gree, but not entirely so. Even within Mexico, the correspon- dences between the Tarascan and Aztec calendars are not fully understood. Some Tarascan month names cannot be translated. Nothing is known about the glyphs and names of the Mixtec months. The Mixe, Otomi, Totonac, and Huaxtec systems are little known and sometimes controversial. The surviving south- ern Zapotec 260-day calendar runs continuously without ref- erence to the solar year; the 16th-century Zapotec calendar had very ancient roots, with features that were not related to the "standard" Mesoamerican system, though it resembled it in other ways (Caso 1967:211-52; Broda de Casa 1969:81- 92). Precious little is known about calendrical symbolism other than that of the Maya and of the Aztecs-and all this in a region which offered ample opportunities for cultural interaction between diverse tribes that were united by history and ethnic origin and shared traditions that are now richly preserved in art and hieroglyphic records. One cannot but agree with the socio-ethnological argument, sometimes advanced by the diffusionists, that many factors determine whether a people will easily adopt and modify cer- tain unusual, foreign cultural peculiarities and just as easily reject other, more utilitarian and common characteristics of the donor culture. Yet, the circumstances considered so far make an extension of this argument to the case of Hindu cultural influences in Mesoamerica a tenuous academic exer- cise, especially in view of the intangibilities of some of the Mesoamerican calendars and the fact that diffusionists them- selves invoke what they think are impressive, persistent paral- lels of detail in symbolism. It is, moreover, extraneous to my goal even if one overlooks the substantial scientific and archae- ological counterevidence and assumes that these influences somehow overcame the innumerable severe impediments to their transmission. The vulnerability of arguments that espouse calendrical "borrowings" and "derivations" is sufficiently seri- ous at the very root. For the reasons I have indicated, diffu- sionists' examples of similarities of calendrical structure and symbolism are themselves suspect and, hence, inadmissible as evidence. Proof or disproof of Hindu cultural influences in Meso- america cannot be adduced from one area of analysis alone. The question of possible correspondences in religious culture is, however, a legitimate, hitherto neglected part of the com- parative ethnology of Asia and the New World. It is worth examining on its own merits. Comments by GEORGE AGOGINO Department of Anthropology, Eastern New Mexico University, Portales, N.M. 88130, U.S.A. 26 iII 78 The basic ingredients that comprise the cultures of Classic Mesoamerica have roots in a well-defined Archaic period and a rapidly developing Formative era. The Olmecs of the 1st millennium B.C. seem to have been the first to utilize the traits characteristic of the civilizations of Mesoamerica-pyramids, the jaguar cult, the zero in mathematics, a number system of bars and dots based on units of 20, a hieroglyphic writing system, a religiously oriented ball game, stelae and other stone monuments, and a well-organized priesthood able by force or religious encouragement to get the peasants to contribute back- breaking labor for civic enterprises during the nongrowing season. I agree with Mundkur that all available osteologic evidence suggests that there was little or no foreign influence in Meso- america prior to the arrival of the Spanish. In defense of the proponents of trans-Pacific migration, however, it must be pointed out that the few bones available for study from the early Formative culture of the Olmecs are certainly insufficient to support a conclusion that outside influences were absent from this group. The similarities between the culture of Mesoamerica in the early centuries A.D. and Hindu culture are no stronger than some apparent similarities between the Olmec culture and the Shang Dynasty of China, both of which existed in the 1st millennium B.C. In both instances, however, it is possible that the "similarities" are the result of independent invention rather than diffusion. The human mind, while it has infinite paths to follow, seems to follow a more restricted number when tied down to similar environments and cultural economic patterns. Independent invention can be mistaken for diffusion when one is dealing with similar ecological and cultural situa- tions. Many instances of diffusion from one area to another-for example, pottery and matches-can be clearly traced, but there are always wide areas of culture in which diffusion or independent invention can be neither proven nor disproven. Recent publications on trans-Pacific migration to Mesoamerica, pro and con, have done nothing to sway most readers one way or the other; still, the speculation encouraged by printed ex- change and verbal argument is healthy for both sides, and readers may still make their own judgments as to the validity of either point of view. by THOMAS S. BARTHEL Volkerkundliches Inslilul, Universildi Tubingen, Schloss, 7400 Tiibingen 1, Federal Republic of Germany. 24 iJI 78 First of all, I wish to thank Mundkur for his extensive criticism of the attempts by three Americanists to tackle one of the most important problems in elucidating the history of ancient Mesoamerica: showing the presence of Hindu-Mexican syn- cretism in both polytheistic systems and astronomical-calendri- cal-astrological patterns. What I call "Indo-Mexican Studies" is still in its infancy. The most thorough checking and re- checking is badly needed. I totally agree with Kirchhoff, who wrote (1964c:306, translation mine):' Obviously Orientalists have to check each and every word said so far by Mexicanists and examine any future venture of comparison with Asiatic cultures. Much of what Mexicanists believe they under- stand will probably turn out to be quite different. Actually Mexican- ists are more motivated to ask for such a check than Orientalists: the Asiatic origin of Mexican cultures is a more important problem for Mexicanists than is the expansion of Asiatic cultures into Mexico from an Orientalist viewpoint. Mundkur's aggressiveness is no substitute for good argu- ments. His most interesting sentence (for me) is the admission "I recognize the difficulties of their task and am impressed by their enterprise." The task is formidable indeed, but the problem could be solved within a decade by furthering closer cooperation of Mexicanists and Indologists and by training students in the religions of both cultural regions and in their most salient languages (Sanskrit and Nahuatl are indispensable). Mundkur presents a rather useful wealth of Indian data on the navagrahah series. Unfortunately, his understanding of a proper method for comparing them with the "Seniores de la Noche" is inadequate. He seems to have overlooked the follow- 1 ((Selbstverstandlich muss alles, aber auch alles, was wir bisher getan haben, und ebenso jede zukiinftige Exkursion eines Mexi- kanisten in das Feld der Vergleiche mit den asiatischen Hochkulturen von den Orientalisten nachgepriift werden, und dabei wird sich vieles als ganz anders herrausstellen, als wir Mexikanisten es zu verstehen glauben. Aber der Anstoss zu dieser Nachprufung muss doch wohl von uns Mexikanisten ausgehen, denn die Frage nach den asiatischen Urspruingen der mexikanischen Kulturen ist ja in hoherem Grade unser Problem, als die Frage nach der Ausdehnung der asiatischen Kulturen nach Mexiko Problem der Orientalisten ist.p 568 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="29">MNndkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA ing (Barthel 1974:57, translation mine):2 "The direct equation of Mesoamerican Lords of the Night and the Indian 'nine planets' cannot be the simple key one must apply for trans- Pacific transformations; there has to be an indirect comparison of a series of nine as a subsystem within the fundamental twenty-day series." Space forbids a detailed repudiation of Mundkur's factual evidence and of certain methodological fallacies in his argu- ment. My comments will be the subject of a separate paper to be published in Germany in the near future. A program of Indo-Mexican studies has to avoid shortcuts, because (1) we are dealing with a historical chain of qualita- tively differentiated links that must be analyzed individually, and (2) the transformation of Hindu religious concepts (on a preiconographic level) into the very different mode of overt expression of, for example, the Mixteca-Puebla codices has to be studied by deep-structure analysis. In Tubingen at present we are investigating the rules which were used in pre-Columbian times to convert Sanskrit names of deities and rites from literary sources of Greater India into the quasi-pictorial notational system of the ancient Mexican codices (see, e.g., Barthel 1972, 1973, 1975b). CA readers might be interested to know that the Ethno- logical Institute of the University of Tiibingen has recently started a middle-range research program of Indo-Mexican studies with a grant from the Breuninger Foundation, Stutt- gart.

BAUDEZ Proyecto Arqueol6gico Copan, A partado Postal 1291, San Pedro Sula, Honduras. 27 iII 78 The real Mesoamericanist diffusionist is a scholar who wishes to "demonstrate" trans-Pacific contacts or influences through resemblances or parallels in Asian cultures. With little research and a bit of luck, he is able to find them. The Orientalist bibliography he uses is generally small and composed of second- ary, popular sources. His readers are nearly always only Americanists, who even if they are not convinced by the "evidence" he offers do not dare to refute him. They have neither the time nor (often) the interest to acquire the necessary knowledge (which has to be considerably greater than that of the diffusionist) to do so. The latter therefore perpetuates his myths with impunity: his presentation of the facts is biased by the selection of the alternatives fitting the demonstration, the chronology is ignored, the sources are distorted or misunder- stood. We may be grateful to Mundkur for having unmasked the imposture. Unlike his opponents, he has taken the time to get acquainted with the Mesoamerican literature which lies out- side his specialty. His article will benefit trans-Pacific contact studies, which until now have been rather a matter of faith ("Do you believe in the Jomon-Chorrera relationships?") than objects of science. The first question is: Are there evidences of imported cultural elements or complexes from Asia in pre- Columbian Mesoamerican cultures? Then follows: When, where, how, and why were they adopted? The problem has to be seriously tackled, following the rules of scientific research. Only then will transoceanic contact studies get the serious attention they deserve. by MARGARET N. BoND Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Jersey City State College, Jersey City, N.J. 07305, U.S.A. 31 iii 78 The possibility of trans-Pacific contacts between ancient Meso- america and Asia is always intriguing and controversial. Along with many Mesoamericanists, I cannot deny the possibility of intermittent pre-Columbian contacts between the civilizations of Mesoamerica and Asia, but I have never been convinced that those contacts influenced in any important way the origin and development of Mesoamerican civilization. Admittedly, the parallels in art styles illustrated by Ekholm (1953) and Heine-Geldern (1966) are striking. Also, studies of the possible similarities of Asian and Mesoamerican calendars are intriguing. Most Mesoamericanists, however, have generally remained unconvinced that the similarities discussed by Kelley (1969, 1972) and Kirchhoff (1964b) are striking or close enough to warrant deriving the basis of the Mesoamerican calendars and other religious symbolism from India and/or China. Mundkur's discussion of the complexities of Hindu symbolism and its developmental history goes far to show the difficulties the diffusionists face in making such ties and the pitfalls they may encounter. In addition to indicating some of the problems in making sound comparisons of the calendrical systems themselves, another important point made by Mundkur is the contradictory time factors and the lack of Hindu material evidence in the Americas. If, indeed, we do view possible Hindu influence as a result of their voyages beyond Southeast Asia, then why do we not also see transmission to Mesoamerica of such other, more obvious, Hindu traits as are found in Southeast Asia? An answer to that question, of course, is that different cultures may adapt the same borrowed traits in very different ways. Still, the evidence should be more apparent than it is, especially when a large complex of religious thought and symbolism is what is considered to have been transmitted. The question of the dynamics of culture change concerns the general processes of diffusion and adaptation of cultural traits. In the case of Asian contacts with Mesoamerica, we must question just which segments of the societies were in contact with one another. Were there good-sized populations of Asians immigrating into Mesoamerica? If so, were they accepted peacefully? If that were the case, would not a peaceful absorp- tion of foreigners be more likely if it were the Hindus adapting to the indigenous American traits rather than the other way? If we consider the contacts to have been merchants and/or sailors, how would such individuals carry the complexities of Hindu religious beliefs, and how would they be able to impress those completely and permanently upon the Mesoamerican belief system? Why did such supposed merchants and sailors not leave any physical evidence of their presence? Even if we postulate deliberate missionizing from Asia, with priests carry- ing the ideas, still we must question how they would be success- ful in translating complex beliefs into an acceptable form for the native Mesoamericans. It is apparent from studies of both voluntary and enforced culture change that people are far less likely to accept new ideas in their world view than other things. Mundkur points out that it seems odd that more Hindu correlations are found with the Aztec calendar, dating quite some period after the postulated influence, than with the Maya, which supposedly was directly influenced. I disagree with him, however, that the Maya calendrical features "undoubtedly" were transmitted to the Aztecs through the Toltecs. Similarities in the Maya, Aztec, Zapotec, and any of the other Mesoameri- can calendars and belief systems are no doubt the result of their ancient basis (probably Olmec?) in the origins of Meso- american civilization. Archaeological work in Mesoamerica has shown that the 2 ((Nicht die unmilldbare Gleichung zwischen mesoamerikanischen Nachtherren und indischen ((Neun Planeten)), sondern die indirekie Vergleichbarkeit solcher Serien, uber ein Subsystem in der funda- mentalen Zwanziger-Folge, ist als transpazifisches Umformungsmodell zu benutzen.) Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 569</page><page sequence="30">roots of the civilization lie in the 2d millennium B.C., and it is apparent that some elements, such as the 260-day sacred calendar, the bar-dot numeration system, and some widespread Mesoamerican deities-for example, the rain god and the feathered serpent-originated at least in the Olmec period of the 1st millennium B.C. In general, the archaeological record indicates a good, consistent sequence of development of the basic Mesoamerican cultural forms from the village-farming level to the more complex communities of the Preclassic, out of which rose the Classic period cultures. Therefore, it seems rather futile to attempt to derive the impetus toward civiliza- tion from the Old World, when it appears clear that an in- digenous base for it is found in the Americas. It seems equally clear that the calendars and widespread elements of Meso- american religious symbolism have an ancient native base which would rule out their Asian origin. by DONALD L. BROCKINGTON Department of Anthropology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C. 27514, U.S.A. 31 iII 78 The subject of pre-Hispanic trans-Pacific contacts between Asia and Mesoamerica (and the rest of the New World) is of considerable interest to many for several reasons. Accurate reconstruction of culture history is one obvious reason, but the understanding of the evolutionary processes resulting in civiliza- tion also is at issue. Further, if the New World civilizations indeed evolved independently from those of the Old World and yet share many characteristics with them, study of parallel traits and institutions should contribute to the understanding of all mankind. I regard the question of trans-Pacific contacts as one of major importance, not one to be lightly treated or quickly dismissed. I do not think there were any such contacts. If there were contacts, I do not think they had any appreciable effect on the course of New World civilizations. I may change my thinking, however, if sufficient evidence is presented. Such evidence must be carefully gathered, critically examined, and judiciously evaluated by those claiming there were contacts as well as those with contrary views. In addition, alternative explanations to diffusion must be considered. Mundkur presents a detailed and cogent rebuttal of three cases for trans-Pacific contacts, all proposed by reputable and highly respected scholars. Few Mesoamericanists have the intimate knowledge and understanding of Hindu religion needed for full evaluation of his critique; I certainly do not and therefore must leave that to others. If his facts and arguments are accepted, Mundkur clearly appears to have been successful. He is to be thanked. We are left with a residue of similarities which merit further study, perhaps from a nondiffusionist viewpoint. How may such similarities and others noted by various scholars be ex- plained without calling upon diffusion? There are several categories of possibilities which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Chance can be ignored, since it explains little or nothing, except in situations in which the number of possi- bilities is limited and rather small. More fruitful explanations may be based on historical reasons (common background of varying antiquity), nature (phenomena found throughout the world), technological limitations or dictates, functional de- mands, and biological factors (such as similar effects of wide- spread poisons, hallucinogens, etc.). I hesitate to recommend "psychic unity" as a possibility, although recent work by sociobiologists may be pointing us again in that direction. by JOHANNA BRODA Centro de Investigaciones Superiores del Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, General Victoria 75, Tlalpan, Mexico 22, D.F., Mexico. 21 III 78 Only by serious and detailed treatment of specific data can the discussion of trans-Pacific diffusion be advanced. Mundkur shows convincingly that the three Mesoamericanists whose contributions he analyzes have relied for their comparison on details of religious symbolism chosen in an eclectic and un- critical way; in this sense their approaches are basically the same. As Mundkur demonstrates with ample evidence, Indian religion and culture history are far more complex than the three writers imply. The main problem in comparing Mesoamerican society with that of ancient India arises from the unequal situation of sources. In Mesoamerica written documents do not exist until the 16th century, and although some indigenous sources refer back to approximately the 12th century A.D., none speaks about society prior to the Postclassic period. Classic Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions have not yet been deciphered satisfactorily. For the early periods we have to rely entirely on the archaeological record. By the middle of the 1st millennium B.C., when the most characteristic features of Mesoamerican civilization began to take definite shape, astronomical knowledge had led to the elaboration of a calendar system which combined exact solar observation (a year of 365 days) with a ritual calendar of 260 days composed of 20 signs and 13 numerals. Polytheistic speculation in connection with this calendar system seems to have been going on at least from the beginning of the Christian era onwards. The pantheon of these periods can only be studied through iconographic material in frescoes and sculpture. Al- though these reveal a great similarity with the pantheon known from the 15th and 16th centuries, it is very risky to make inferences about lists of gods and assume continuity over some 2,000 years. Mundkur shows with the Indian material that numerous changes, well documented in the historical sources, occurred in the polytheistic speculations there; the diffusionists deal too liberally with the question of chronology, in the case of trans-Pacific relations as well as within Mesoamerica itself. Mundkur's argumentation convincingly discredits the diffu- sionist hypothesis, but on the other hand his paper shows the usefulness of comparative cross-cultural studies. In the case of Mesoamerican polytheistic and calendrical speculations, a comparative approach contributes to a better understanding of these complex phenomena. They are much less amply docu- mented in the written tradition of Mexico than they are, for example, in India. The series of patron deities and the elaborate structure of their calendar ritual are in fact still very little understood. From a purely "ethnological" comparison with "primitive cultures" or with ethnographic material from modern Mexican peasant communities, one will never obtain correspondingly complex material. The cultures to compare are indeed those of ancient India, China, and the ancient Hellenistic world. Such comparisons can be useful in the sense of suggesting possible interpretations for the less well-docu- mented Mexican material. These comparative studies have to be undertaken in "multi- disciplinary" collaboration between Mesoamericanists and other specialists, not because the "Indo-Americanist" is an impossibility, but because it is extremely difficult for a single scholar equally to master several different fields. Mundkur's article proves this circumstance. To my knowledge, it is the first serious scientific reply to the diffusionist postulate of trans- Pacific Hindu influences on Mesoamerican religion written by a competent specialist on ancient India. Although his paper disqualifies the diffusionist approach, it allows one to visualize the possibility of cross-cultural comparisons between equally complex phenomena in the Old and the New World which by no means need to be of common historical origin. The similari- ties exist in structural-functional aspects of systems of beliefs rather than in concrete details as the diffusionists imply. In order to explore such similarities in ideological systems of different cultures, it is, however, necessary to analyze at the same time the social and economic conditions which have pro- duced such ideologies. 570 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="31">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA by MICHAEL D. COE Department of Anthropology, Yale University, New Haven, Conn. 06520, U.S.A. 2 II 78 I am in no position to comment upon Mundkur's use of Hindu data in his attack on the diffusionists, but he definitely needs to sharpen up his pencil when using Mesoamerican material. Among inaccuracies of data and interpretation are the following: 1. He confuses the Glyph G series on Maya monuments with lunar calculations: "a series of nine lunar hieroglyphs of the Maya," "a lunar sequence (Glyph G)." 2. He underestimates the role that hand gesture played in Maya iconography. As an unpublished study by Lawrence Bardawil shows, this was highly codified, very complex, and quite comparable to the mudrd of Hindu-Buddhist art. 3. He claims that there is an "extraordinary disagreement among modern Mayanists as to whether Classic Maya sculp- tures represent priest-kings or deities." I don't know what Mayanists he is talking about. All those known to me identify the figures as rulers. 4. Contrary to Mundkur, there is no evidence that "the Maya transmitted, through the Toltecs, the essential features of their calendar to the Aztec homeland." Most of us believe that the shared features derive from a common origin. 5. A study of the works of Miguel Leon-Portilla (not cited here) would show Mundkur that a pantheistic religious system very similar to the Hindu dvandva-including dualism and a transcendental essence-existed among the Aztec intelligentsia, the only Mesoamerican group for which we have adequate data. 6. The Popol Vuh shows little or no Christian influence, even though it was written down in Spanish letters after the Con- quest; this important source mentions many more than seven deities, not all of whom are "underworld gods of destruction." 7. Mundkur assumes that because our surviving Meso- american religious codices are Postclassic, the material which they contain cannot be earlier than this. Those few which came through the holocaust of the Conquest almost surely are compilations of far older material, probably going back to the beginning of the Classic. 8. The Maya Chac is not a "proboscidiform" deity; what is usually taken for his "long nose" is a much extended upper lip. 9. There is no evidence that "the primary pre-Nahuatl [sic] symbolism of the serpent in Mesoamerica is pluvial and cosmo- logical." 10. The unfounded notion that the Maya religion was "animistic and devoid of a pantheon" is peculiar to George Kubler and his followers, but not taken seriously by most Mesoamericanists. On the testimony of pictorial Maya ceram- ics, as well as the codices, the Maya pantheon was just as large and complex as that of Hindu India. 11. In his discussion of Mesoamerican calendar systems, Mundkur confuses the 260-day cycle with "months" (20-day periods belonging to the 365-day "year"). I point out these errors because they tend to weaken my confidence in other data for which I do not have much expertise. In a more general way, I believe that his tendentious stand against trans-Pacific diffusion is probably wrong. It should be noted that he puts all his emphasis upon India, not upon Southeast Asia or Indonesia (which are far from the mere Hindu cultural outposts he would have us believe) or upon early China. Tolstoy's (1963) magnificent study of the making of bark paper on both sides of the Pacific presents compelling evidence that this process and its paraphernalia diffused at an early date from eastern Indonesia to Mesoamerica. Now, the primary use of bark paper among the Maya and probably other Mesoamericans was in screen-fold codices remarkably similar to ritual books collected by ethnographers among the Batak of Indonesia. If screen-fold books on bark paper reached the New World from Indonesia, then one may assume some- thing was written on them and that there was somebody to interpret these writings. Why not calendrical-astronomical knowledge? Even though Mundkur believes his Hindu data demolish the diffusionist argument, I hold that some Asian-Mesoamerican correspondences will turn out to be homologies and not just analogies. by MARVIN COHODAS Department of Fine Arts, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada V6T 1W5. 4 III 78 The author criticizes several Mesoamericanists on their hypothesis of the influence of Asian calendric systems and deities on Mesoamerica for the following weaknesses: (1) They have sufficient knowledge of only one of the two traditions they are comparing. (2) They cite so many esoteric data that the reader is unable to judge and therefore accepts the hypothe- sis blindly. While the author casts considerable doubt on the contributions of Kirchhoff, Barthel, and Kelley, his argument may be characterized by precisely the same two weaknesses. This suggests that we will not achieve an understanding of the diffusion problem until Mesoamerican and Asian specialists sit down together and objectively examine the evidence for and against trans-Pacific contact, as revealed in calendric systems and religious symbolism or in any other cultural artifacts. The competitive backbiting represented by this paper will not foster either cross-cultural harmony or the advance- ment of knowledge. by JEREMIAH F. EPSTEIN Departent of Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Tex. 78712, U.S.A. 5 iv 78 Mundkur's critique is a most welcome and long needed addition to the literature on pre-Columbian trans-Pacific diffusion. He has demolished the Kelley/Kirchhoff argument with a careful review of the Hindu data and, at the same time, has given us a statement of Hindu thought that serves for comparison with Mesoamerican religious-calendrical concepts. Having struggled with the tantalizing correspondences pointed out by Kelley and Kirchhoff, I believe it necessary to emphasize that, even without Mundkur's decisive paper, their thesis was uncon- vincing. In brief: (1) they were not comparing the same things, and (2) the attributes chosen were selected from such a huge data bank that some parallels seem almost inevitable. Kelley and Kirchhoff, and their predecessors, point out resemblances between the sequence of deities and names of the Hindu lunar mansions and the day names and presiding deities in the Aztec Tonalpohualli. These are not the same things. It is Aztec and Hindu lunar mansions, or Aztec and Hindu day names, that should be compared. It is impossible to compare lunar mansions because the presence of this concept in Meso- american thought is doubtful. The idea of lunar mansions or a zodiac is based on the awareness of an ecliptic and a set of asterisms that permit the observer to mark the passage of the sun, moon, and planets in the sky. Spinden (1916) reviewed the claims for a Mesoamerican zodiac and rejected them with arguments that are still valid. Those who favor the zodiacal view base their claim on some statements found in Duran and on debatable interpretations of p. 23 of the Paris Codex and a mural found at the Monjas in Chichen Itza. While Kelley (1976:45-50, fig. 14), in a carefully reasoned review of the data, argues strongly for a zodiac in the Paris/Monjas material, his arguments are unconvincing. Prevailing opinion is that these glyph sets are related to eclipses, and Lounsbury has recently supported this interpretation (Coe 1975:28-29). Whether or Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 571</page><page sequence="32">not the Maya or Aztec had a zodiac is obviously an unsettled issue. Until it is demonstrated that the concept of an ecliptic with its attendent asterisms was part of Mesoamerican thought, any comparisons of Aztec day names with Hindu lunar man- sions must be considered as something akin to comparing apples and oranges. Mundkur's discussion of Agni, who in one guise or another is a god of fire, water, wind, and sun, emphasizes the multiple roles and attributes of Hindu deities. Precisely the same con- fusing situation occurs in Mesoamerica. Vaillant (1944:table 10) tried to bring some order into the picture by classifying the Mesoamerican pantheon into great gods, creative deities, fertility gods, gods of rain and moisture, fire gods, etc. These were not mutually exclusive categories; Quetzalcoatl, Tlaloc, Tezcatlipoca, and Xipe were among the most prominent of those who occupied two or more domains. Nicholson's (1971) brilliant effort to organize the pantheon in terms of a series of themes and deity complexes represents a different approach to the same set of data. The complexity of the Mesoamerican pantheon is such that no single scheme will ever prove totally satisfactory. The Mesoamerican deities, like the Hindu ones, have multiple domains and multiple attributes. Under such circumstances, one is bound to find some striking resemblances between them. These criticisms of the Kelley/Kirchhoff thesis are caveats rather than decisive arguments, and herein lies the root of the difficulty in dealing with these religious-calendrical resem- blances. What has long been needed is a view from the other side, and this is precisely what Mundkur has given us. He has shown that the Kelley/Kirchhoff appraisal of the Hindu material is superficial, if not wrong. Therefore their carefully worked out list of resemblances cannot stand on its own. One would now suppose that the subject of Hindu-Meso- american diffusion of calendrical-religious concepts is a dead issue, but there are so many resemblances between the two areas in their approaches to reality that one cannot help but wonder about them. Explaining the parallels between separate, isolated cultures is something we need to do. Here, Mundkur's last paragraph says it all. by YOLOTL GONZALEZ Soffa 14, Mexico 20, D.F., Mexico. 27 III 78 Mundkur's critique is very useful and well documented, both on the Mesoamerican and the Indian areas. I agree with him on the whole in his main arguments, which I myself have made to Kirchhoff. Mundkur says that to think that the calendar system was borrowed from Asia is to underestimate the possibility of an autonomous development of the pre- Columbian societies, but to deny such a possibility is to go to the other extreme. I cannot forget that Kirchhoff's main argu- ment about this possible contact was that such a complex calendrical system associated with gods and animals could not be the product of independent invention. We must continue our research, gathering data that may prove or disprove some type of contact. In Mexico, and I think on the American continent in general, new archaeological discoveries are continually changing our ideas. My approach to the study of the astronomic-astrological beliefs of the ancient Mexicans was actually born with the idea of doing a comparative study of Mexico and India. So far I have completed only the first part (Gonzalez Torres 1975). I studied the Mexica for the same reason that Kirchhoff examined their calendrical systems and gods-there are more data available for these people than for the others. I found that they worshipped the sun and the planets and thought they influenced people in different ways, but I could not advance farther in that area, which is very obscure. For instance, the name of the month of the 365-day calendar is metzt1i, "moon," yet its duration is only 20 days. I have advanced the hypothesis that the Mexica may have had something of the type of the Egyptian decanates and that the 20-day month was actually formed of two 10-day periods. There are almost no references to moon worship or to the moon's influence on people or on nature, and though I am sure they must have existed there are no data on anything like the nakshatras or thithis. I stopped short of a serious comparison with the Indian system because, on the one hand, I would have had to choose a particular period and perhaps a particular place for the Indian data, the range of time for these data being so wide, and, on the other hand, the data on the Mesoamerican side are too limited. I think that comparisons along this line may be very useful, however, mainly in helping us understand the ancient cultures for which there is not enough evidence. I think that the great merit of Kirchhoff's (1962, 1963, 1964a) works on trans-Pacific contacts was to open a way which was absolutly blocked-at least in Mexico-by an absurd chauvinistic attitude: that nothing could have come from outside, that all of the American culture was autochthonous. This attitude was not backed by a sound critique like Mund- kur's. On the contrary, any idea of possible contact was fought with an almost religious zeal, to the point of rudeness to Kirchhoff and Heine-Geldern at an Americanist Congress held in Mexico in 1962. This chauvinistic attitude in Mexican studies was reflected not only in attacks on anyone who dared to suggest foreign influences on Mesoamerican culture, but also in a lack of interest in the study of other civilizations. This situation can be seen even now with the "Asiatic mode of production"; everyone accepts what Marx said about the Asian societies without trying to learn more about those societies. Comparative studies, however, are fundamental for an under- standing of the cultures with which Mesoamericanists are concerned. Mundkur somehow ignores the Teotihuacan culture, giving the impression that the Maya were the predecessors of the Aztecs. Kirchhoff thought that the Mexica had long ago left the Teotihuacan area, going to Aztlan in the north and then coming back, bringing their old gods with them. He considered the Aztec gods very ancient, and that is the reason he could compare them with the Indian ones. Finally, I disagree with Mundkur's opinion that human sacrifice never had a place in Hindu custom. Not considering sati, which was practiced not only in India but also in China and Japan (with a different form of death), Mitra (1876) wrote an essay on human sacrifice in Vedic times, and for later times there are writings like the Kalika Purana, in which the full instructions for a human sacrifice are given (Gait 1913). There are also many instances in the gazetteers, though it seems that the ideas about human sacrifice in India and in Mexico were totally different. by JOHN S. HENDERSON Department of Anthropology, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. 14853, U.S.A. 24 iII 78 If the difficulty of dealing with more than one complex cultural tradition is insufficient to dissuade serious scholars from taking up the problem of Asian influence in pre-Columbian America, fear of becoming the object of a critique like Mundkur's helps tip the balance for all but the thickest-skinned. To my mind, Mundkur leaves little doubt that Kelley, Kirchhoff, and Barthel fail to come to grips with the internal complexity and historical context of the Hindu tradition. Mundkur is most convincing in dealing with Hindu symbols, though even here fewer details and a more straightforward organization might have made for a more effective presentation. When he ventures into Mesoamerica, though, Mundkur too falls victim to an imperfect understanding of a complex tradition. Toltec and Aztec symbols trace their ancestry to Teotihuacan, not to the 572 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA Maya, and few Mesoamericanists would agree that the Classic Maya were animists devoid of a proper pantheon. Fortunately, Mundkur concentrates on the use Kelley, Kirchhoff, and Barthel make of Hindu symbols. This is timely, for some Mesoamericanists have come to accept a connection between the two symbol systems as established. Kelley, no longer concerned with demonstrating a relationship, uses Hindu data to elucidate Maya symbols. Mundkur's concern that Mesoamericanists were being beguiled en masse, though, is exaggerated. To be convincing, any diffusionist argument must be founded on specific comparison of documented cultural complexes with an appropriate chronological relationship. Most archaeologists, innocent as they are of the intricacies of Hindu symbols, can easily see that this is not what Kelley, Kirchhoff, and Barthel were up to. Mundkur's paper is a narrowly focussed critique of these three scholars. He leaves the issue itself-the possibility of Hindu influence in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica-open. This is understandable. Even when the comparison is limited to religious-astronomical-calendric symbols (a dubious procedure), the complexity and internal variation of each tradition are formidable. Admitting the possibility that Hindu influence might have been transmitted via Indianized Southeast Asia compounds the difficulties. Worse yet is the possibility that similarities between Asian and American cultural features might be the result of a very ancient common heritage-a hypothesis with stupefying data requirements. The resem- blances catalogued so far are too general or too scattered to demonstrate a pre-Columbian connection, but it strikes me as rash to dismiss the issue out of hand. by R. A. JAIRAZBHOY 37 Hillside Rd., Northwood, Middlesex, England. 21 iII 78 In championing his cause of antidiffusionism, Mundkur gets carried away, pronouncing that the hints of parallel traits between Old and New World civilisation are imaginary and that there is a complete absence of foreign influences in Meso- america before the 16th century. From the carefully selected literature he cites, such a view might just be tenable, but why suppress references to works which present very different evidence and arrive at quite contrary conclusions? It seems that Mundkur would tend to dub all such researches "sophistry" or "superficial." Even if in some cases these charges are de- served, however, this is no good reason for condemning the whole. Mundkur is himself guilty of the sin of omission. In a journal avowedly concerned with current developments, he stops short at literature many years old and ignores recent developments that have made the latter seem old hat. I should like to bring the picture up to date. In my 1974 book, I set out a vast body of new evidence showing that the first civilisation of Mesoamerica, the Olmec, was a composite of Ramessid Egyptian conceptions and traits and those of Shang China. Historical explanations were given for the presence of these, and they were dated ca. 1187 B.C. and ca. 1110 B.C. respectively (completely consonant with current archaeological thinking). Mundkur has first ignored, then scathingly condemned (CA 18: 340) the book, and I have already replied (CA 19: 459-60). Meanwhile, Wiercifiski's examination of Olmec skulls (1972; see Jairazbhoy 1974:135) resulted in his detecting Negroid racial traits and those of Shang China, which once again confirmed the cultural evidence I had offered. Von Wuthenau's study (1975) of early Meso- american physiognomy corroborated the presence of a great variety of racial types, mainly Negroid and Chinese. He cited and supported my identification of the Egyptian presence. Van Sertima (1976) followed suit, though relying on an obsolete earlier chronology dating the presence of Egyptian Negroes in Mexico to the 8th century B.C., by which time the Olmecs were well past their prime. Carter resuscitated the elephant contro- versy (1975a) and elsewhere set out reasons "why I'm no longer a 'standard Americanist'" (1975b). Shao (1976) has demonstrated Tang Dynasty influence on Maya iconography. My second volume, entitled Asians in Pre-Columbian Mexico and privately printed in a limited edition (1976), among other things makes nonsense of Mundkur's daim that there was "nothing remotely akin to Hindu symbols and conventions in Mesoamerica" (see esp. Jairazbhoy 1976:58, 62-63, 73, 80-82). For the first time in this book, the theme is treated throughout in a chronological framework, and the imported traits are linked historically to their sources. (For long impartial reviews of the two volumes, see Young 1975 and Covey 1978.) For a score of years I have worked and published on the diffusionist theme in the Old World and the New. Scarcely any of the primary civilisations has escaped my net. I hope to show in a work now in progress the immense debts the great cultures of the past owed to each other. by DAVID H. KELLEY Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta., Canada T3C 2M2. 27 II 78 It is flattering to have one's work subjected to such detailed scrutiny, and in future works on this subject I shall attempt to correct my work in the light of Mundkur's criticisms or to answer them in detail. Here, I will restrict myself to certain general points. First, I disagree in principle with the view that "proof... cannot be adduced from one area of analysis alone." If one can show a sufficient number of apparently arbitrary parallels between any two systems or parts of systems, that alone is adequate to prove some sort of common origin, regardless of time, place, or other apparent obstacles. Such a demonstration can be refuted by showing that the parallels are faulty, as Mundkur has attempted to do here, or by demonstrating that they are not arbitrary, but not by showing that other parts of the system are different or that some other system shows no parallels. Second, I think that human groups have been influenced by other human groups since the australopithecines and that no group has ever evolved "independently" if by that is meant without significant contacts from other cultures. I see no difference in this regard between Mesoamericans and other cultures. The invention of the Mesoamerican calendar was a major intellectual feat, and the fact that the inventor or inventors relied on ideas introduced from outside Mesoamerica in no way diminishes that feat. All invention and all culture rely on previous ideas. It is of some interest, however, to try to determine where the ideas came from. Third, unlike Mundkur or Kubler, I think that a full Meso- american pantheon of deities has deep roots in Mesoamerican culture. I also assume that most deities have multiple aspects and that nonetheless they have salient characteristics which lead to cross-cultural identifications. For purposes of the seven-day week, Woden may be equated with Mercury, and was. I do not think that any of the equations I have suggested involve a greater cultural distortion than that of the equation of Woden and Mercury. People themselves borrow traits out of context and create new patterns. Distortion and change are often coupled with historical persistence. Symbols from a foreign culture, even when accepted, must be modified to fit existing local beliefs. They are not introduced into a vacuum. With respect to the meaningful identification of particular deities, the fact that Agni's name is linguistically cognate with ignis, Lat. 'fire,' seems to me to validate a special connection with fire, and similarly with Soma's name. One final point: Mundkur thinks that my view "is apt to be seductive" because it depends on specialized knowledgfe which Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978 573</page><page sequence="34">needs to be "closely scrutinized." In my own experience, precisely because it depends on specialized knowledge most scholars feel free to reject it without examination. I hope that Mundkur's arguments will lead others to examine the argu- ments. As a starting point, I recommend my 1960 article, not considered by Mundkur. by JoHN PADDOCK Apartado 464, Oaxaca, Oax., Mexico. 29 iII 78 Apart from clarifying the area of diffusion, Mundkur's article shows that many benefits would come from a non-European analysis of Mesoamerican religion-and, presumably, other aspects of culture as well. Diffusion, however, is the question before us. Like others, Mundkur refers to antidiffusionists as "isolationists." They may exist, but I have never found anyone willing to confess being one. A widely acceptable statement missing here is that of Phillips (1966). In addition, I have suggested to a number of Mesoamericanists-without ever hearing an objection- that when the Polynesians reached Easter Island, they had no way of knowing that the next stop eastward was South America; some of them, given their seafaring skills, must have reached it, but they left no trace. Further, as Caso showed with examples in the widely neglected article (1962) that Mundkur justly brings to our attention, no amount of similarity in form, function, symbolism, or all three is proof of contact. Before Caso's death in 1970 he had collected many other examples with overwhelming similarities of detail in cultures that could not have had contact. If such able and industrious scholars as Mundkur here reviews can't demonstrate the India-Mesoamerica diffusion, perhaps they have done something else for us, with his help: shown that there wasn't any. That would hardly be strange, since India is as far from Mesoamerica as one can get on land; the farthest point is in the ocean south of it. Resolving one question always poses another. If not from India, where did the Mesoamericans get their calendars? Inventing is not rare; "inventors" differ only in degree from the rest of us. American Indians can't and couldn't stop in- venting, all day every day. Even when aiming at imitation, humans imitate imperfectly, i.e., innovate. Nearly all inventions are inconsequential; many that might have been important occur at the wrong time or place; but the hidden assumption of the old-time radical diffusionists-that American Indians were incapable of significant invention, or at least of inventing anything that had already been thought of a hemisphere away-surely is not in the thinking of many today. The implicit racism of the early Egypt-centered school surely is no part of modern diffusionists' attitudes. What, then, are some of the psychic needs met by a diffusionist stance? The practice of science is motivated human behavior, and it is a long time since scientists have been naive enough to propose that they are moved solely by a burning need to know the truth. We are not amebas, or even ants; our motivations are complex. The psychology of ancient peoples too affects archeology. The sudden development of ancient cultures is often explained by diffusion, from nearby or from afar. We tend to assume that the exact site we are excavating was not the place of origin of any invention we find there (Kidder, Jennings, and Shook 1946:256). Cultures normally develop, however, by fits and starts, enabling archeologists to define phases or periods. All culture is created by human beings who differ not only from each other, but also over time. As Kroeber (1944) showed, innovators of consequence often coincide temporally, so that well-recorded recent instances tend to occur as bursts of creativity. The tiny daily individual alterations of culture do not always cancel each other out, like Brownian movements; sometimes they add up to surges of important culture change in which diffusion may be absent or insignificant. by ALLISON C. PAULSEN Horseshoe Hill Rd., Pound Ridge, N.Y. 10576, U.-S.A. 29 III 78 Only a decade ago, the organizers of a symposium devoted to problems of pre-Columbian contacts found few scholars to argue a case against long-distance cultural diffusion (Riley et al. 1971:446). In the last two years, however, statements have appeared discrediting not only a theory of proposed Shang- Olmec connections (Grove 1976), but also a Jomon-Valdivia hypothesis of trans-Pacific New World origins (Paulsen 1977). Mundkur's devastating critique of supposed Hindu-Meso- american ideological linkages now makes the score against trans-Pacific origins three in a row. Times have changed. Why? I believe that the unprecedented respectability of anti- diffusionism today is one aspect of the advancing front of the well-known theoretical and methodological revolution that has already drastically transformed both cultural anthropology and archaeology. The antiuniformitarian denial of regularities of cultural process, the untestably idealist nature of interpretive models, and the reliance upon "emic" (Harris 1968:571) in- formation that characterized the vanishing era of historical particularism also included a strong dependence upon diffusion. All these formulations reflected an "aquatic view of culture ... [whose] literature abounds in phrases such as 'cultural stream' and in references to the 'flowing' of new cultural elements into a region" (Binford 1965:204). "Aquatic" is certainly the word for a theoretical position that gives credence to hypothetical long-distance ocean voyages, while the term "diffusion" itself comes from the Latin verb "to pour." For some time now, anthropologists and archaeologists alike have been discovering the overwhelming explanatory power of a materialist approach that is directly antithetical to historical particularism in every respect. In this view, regularities of cultural change exist and are discoverable; such changes arise primarily from autochthonous interaction between environ- mental, ecological, technological, demographic, and economic factors; a demonstrable extralocal contact or incursion is not a unique historical accident, but rather the result of the operation of these factors within a macrosystem that includes the receptor group; and "etic" (Harris 1968:575) data must be adduced to support any hypothesis whatsoever. By renouncing emicism, or "paleopsychology" (Binford 1965:204), postrevolutionary ar- chaeologists have, in effect, expanded the dictum "Archaeology is anthropology or it is nothing" (Willey and Phillips 1958:2) to read "Archaeology is materialist and elic anthropology or it is nothing." Every successful scientific revolution displays a striking advance in quantitative precision (Kuhn 1970:151-52). More- over, any development that makes possible more precise relative dating thereby increases the opportunities for studying cultural process (Rowe 1959:317). Thus it is no accident that the counterarguments most effective against the Shang-Olmec, the Jomon-Valdivia, and the Hindu-Mesoamerican trans- Pacific theories consist primarily of specific chronological anomalies, incompatibilities, and discontinuities brought out by close examination of the chronological placement and order of elements in the archaeological record of the supposedly related areas. If trans-Pacific hypotheses can be invalidated today simply by means of today's relatively crude and incomplete local sequences-for example, in Mesoamerica, where a signifi- cant revolutionary skirmish against outmoded developmental- stage schemes is just starting (Sabloff 1973:1772; Niederberger 1976:9), and an inevitable revolt against type-frequency seriation has not yet begun-we may confidently expect other, equally shaky trans-Pacific hypotheses to be exposed in the future, after strict periodization and stylistic, or similiary, seriation have produced local sequences that are more highly refined than present methods of archaeological analysis and ordering allow. Even now, however, long-distance cultural 574 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="35">diffusion has already lost whatever explanatory competence it ever possessed; it now occupies a backwater, outside the main- stream of current anthropology. by J. D. STEWART Department of Anthropology, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ont., Canada P7B SEJ. 28 iII 78 My comments pertain to the material with which I am most familiar, namely, the Indian nakfatra and Mesoamerican day- name complexes, plus an additional host of Old World lists described by Mundkur as "wholly ancillary and less weighty." Contributions from specialists in Indian literature and ico- nography are sorely needed in this field. Mundkur's critique, however, seems to me as blemished by polemics and ad hoc reasoning as the writings of the "diffusionists." It is difficult to transcend this in our present state of theoretical and method- ological weakness. The lack of diagnostic criteria for determining what degree of item similarity, short of identity, constitutes "correspondence" impedes progress, since neither a proponent nor an opponent can make a falsifiable statement concerning the validity of a proposed "correspondence." For example, Mundkur's objections to comparing Agni with Xiutecuhtli, Soma with Mayauel, or Yama with the Mesoamerican day Death are objections that I find unconvincing, but he and I would be unable to argue these points from principles com- parable in power to the principles used, say, in linguistics. Even where scholars can agree on particular item compari- sons, the formal properties of the lists complicate the alignment problem. Every one of the lists shows some degree of internal repetition and overlapping of symbols. Furthermore, virtually every list is known to vary from one source to another in sequential ordering, item alternation, and so on. These formal properties make it possible for different analysts, or even a single analyst at different times, to produce differing alignments of the lists. Mundkur considers this merely futile game-playing, if not devious manipulation of the data. He may be interested to learn that, when the sequential orders of the lists were randomized and these randomized lists compared, it was possible to align them in a seemingly meaningful way, though the agreement was not as good as that attained with the real ones (Stewart 1974:239-59). Thus, some patterned similarity is built into any group of lists sharing some common core of items, and it does create analytical problems. What calls for explanation, however, is why, if the lists are historically independent, different peoples have selected for inclusion in their lists similar restricted sets of symbols, given the inex- haustible range of animate and inanimate items present in their physical and intellectual environments. Chronology also is a problem, in that the earliest textual attestations of the various lists are scattered over a long time span. Dated textual or archaeological documentation, however, important though it is, only establishes the minimum ages of the lists. The assumption that these lists have earlier pre- histories which can be partially reconstructed through com- parative analysis underlies studies, like my own (Stewart 1974), which utilize late data in considering the possibility of early connections. In this context, the interlist and intralist variations, especially when structurally patterned, constitute crucial data, not a hopeless hodgepodge. Mundkur distorts the issue by passing off the Chinese, Burmese, Cambodian, and other lists as unimportant to the argument. These sequences are of considerable relevance to the question of relationships among various Old World calendrical-astronomical traditions themselves, as well as to the Mesoamerican system. Un- fortunately, the limitation of space forces me to refer elsewhere (Stewart 1974, n.d.) for substantive support of the points I have been making. Even with the Indian material, Mundkur is sometimes misleading. An example is his confusion of the set of nakEatra animals with the related but separate set of mostly Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA nonanimal pictorial symbols of the nakvatras. In fact, each of these sets of symbols is known in variant 27- and 28-item lists. Considering this variability, it is disappointing to see Mundkur allege that Kirchhoff's animal list differs from his because Kirchhoff is "oblivious of" the makara or has "replaced" this or that animal with another. Kirchhoff simply uses one variant of the list and Mundkur another. Although I hate to stop at this point, I must conclude by suggesting that, despite the complexities of the data and the shortcomings of analyses produced thus far (including mine), there are meaningful nonspurious correlations among the sequences. I still regard communication as the most plausible explanation for the similarities but am ready to consider other explanations. Reply by BALAJI MTJNDKUR, University of Connecticut, Box U-42, Storrs, Conn. U.S.A. 26 iII 78 I thank all my colleagues who have contributed to this debate with their comments. Their views speak lucidly for themselves, obviating the need for more than brief consideration of two or three points and detailed replies to only two commentators. Though my approach was primarily from the Indological standpoint, I am pleased that the few questions raised about the Mesoamerican material have been controverted by Ameri- canists themselves and, in any event, do not significantly affect the thrust of my critique. This is clear from the comments of Gonzalez (who, in addition to her experience in Indological and Mesoamericanist studies, is uniquely qualified to represent the late Paul Kirchhoff, her associate) and even more from those of Broda. Both recognize the reliability of the great mass of original ancient manuscripts available to the Indologist as compared with the frequently opinionative interpretations fostered by the rarity of intelligible preconquest Mesoamerican sources. It is clear, moreover, that the decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphs is as yet incomplete and that the grounds for recognizing an unambiguous pantheon of the Classic and Preclassic Maya are insufficient. I again touch upon this topic in my replies to Kelley and Coe, below. On the question of internal cultural relationships, some commentators seem to think that I regard the Maya as the predecessors of the Aztecs. I did not say this or mean to imply it, though I see that I may not have expressed myself clearly on this point. I was referring onlv to the transmission of calendrical concepts from the Maya to the Aztecs via the Toltecs. I now realize that the rudiments of a common calendar may have been shared by a number of Mesoamerican cultures, including that of Teotihuacan. Still, my chronological argu- ments remain unaffected. Gonzalez quite properly disagrees with the wording in my sentence on human sacrifice in India-a minor point in my theme which I had felt no urgency to elaborate upon-but we agree that the observances of this custom in Mesoamerica and in India followed utterly different patterns. From the view- point of diffusion of culture, this is an unproductive topic, but a brief explanation may be in order. Readers should realize that among Hindus human sacrifice never attained the level of a systematic, communal ritual. It was not practiced with the frequency and cyclic regularity of the Mesoamerican, nor did it involve at any one time as many victims. Mitra (1876) stresses the aboriginal background, but among Vedic Hindus human sacrifice (puruEvamedha) constituted only a very minor segment of their extensive sacrificial rituals. Its sporadic per- formance was usually in fulfillment of a private vow or to Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978</page><page sequence="36">mitigate a natural disaster and rarely involved more than a solitary victim. It is attested in certain periods of the Brihmaiias but not in others. Some Samihita hymns "probably" refer to it. To the vast masses of Hindus, whose philosophical outlook is basically a tolerant one and who abhor unnecessary killing of animals, human sacrifice, by and large, is an aberrant custom. In the Sveta Yajur Veda and Satapatha Brahmana (XIII. 6; II. 13) it is merely emblematic, for they enjoin that the "victims" be released. In theory, Hinduism can be shown through its varied literature to have sanctioned almost any custom, including gory ones. In practice, human sacrifice, though it is clearly attested in the Kdlikd Purazna, more often than not was largely of the token variety and involved no more than drawing a few drops of blood as a votive offering to the goddess Chandika (Mitra 1876:117). Details of sacrificial rites which give hardly any importance to human offerings are described by Sarma (1963a, b). These are Vedic customs of roughly the early 1st millennium B.C., when the Hindus, according to Kirchhoff (1964b:27), are alleged to have transmitted their "great religious complex of War, Human Sacrifice and Blood [to] the Olmecs [and] related groups of peoples...." The great volume of Puraiic literature has no place for human sacrifice. It is mentioned neither in the much revered Bhdgavata Purdana (also see Lalye 1973: xiv, 333) nor in the Tantric Agni Purdna. Its central deity, Agni, was propitiated by sacrificing a ram or he-goat (de Mallmann 1963:127, 241-44). I look forward to the detailed reply Kelley may make in the future. I hope he will consider CA as an outlet for it so that others besides myself will be given the opportunity of deter- mining whether his remarks relate specifically and directly to the many queries I have posed while spelling out my reasons for regarding his claims as unpersuasive. True, he has not had sufficient time to verify my objections by consulting the sources of information I have cited. On the other hand, it is doubtful that the superstructure of his extraordinary hypothesis of calendric borrowings and derivations from Hindu India and Southeast Asia would ever have been erected had he (a) been aware of the pertinent literature and (b) analyzed it judiciously. I will comment briefly on Kelley's three general points before I sum up my reaction to his latest position. First, Kelley's view of the reliability of conclusions based on "arbitrary parallels" (his own words) involving two systems or parts of these systems and no others is likely to shock those who respect the scientific method. Assuming that his parallels are plausible (leave aside for the moment their susceptibility to proof), does he really believe that one can ignore a far greater volume of data that reduces the magnitude of that plausibility and yet place credence in one's assumptions-and arbitrary ones at that? The word "arbitrary," the Concise Oxford Dictionary tells us, means "derived from mere opinion; capricious, unrestrained." Kelley's belief is tantamount not only to a rejection of alternatives from studies in archaeology and ethnology that demolish his reasons for imagining this parallel or that, but also to a disdain of the data from a number of scientific disciplines (see Stewart 1973) that bear on human migrations. The methodological resources of these scholarly areas are far more powerful and their premises much more demanding in respect to inductive reasoning than Kelley's. Whether he is justified in his claims of parallels, and in his belief that these should be, or can be, envisioned as independent isolates, depends entirely on one's standards for the acceptance of "evidence." Second, Kelley's remark (which I unreservedly endorse) that the invention of the (260-day) Mesoamerican calendar was "a major intellectual feat" is a bewildering one. As late as 1974 he maintained that "the Mesoamerican calendar system was an invention based on a thorough knowledge of Hellenistic science in its Indo-Greek variant" (p. 135, italics mine), and, thoug,h he did not elaborate on them, he wrote (p. 136 italics mine) about "the detailed similarities which suggest the derivation of the developed Mesoamerican calendar from India." What is one to make of these astonishing contradictions? Further, only last year he is reported to have suggested at a conference (see CA 19: 204) that a proto-Asian calendar astrology was brought to Mesoamerica, probably from northern India, at the end of the 1st millennium B.C. How much more (alleged) imitation of calendrical symbolism and/or structural features from overseas is he willing to tolerate in the Mesoamerican calendar before it ceases to merit recognition as "a major intellectual feat"? Let me be precise: What is primarily at issue is not a diminution of credit for Mesoamerica-assuming for the sake of argument that the 260-day calendar shows overseas influences-but the simple proposition that evidence of borrowings, derivations, and detailed similarities is woefully lacking in Kelley's (as in Kirchhoff's and Barthel's) writings, especially insofar as India and Southeast Asia are concerned. Third, Mesoamerican area specialists can judge better than I the correctness of Kelley's statement on Mesoamerican pantheons. Every pantheon, regardless of religion and country, has "deep roots." Kelley's thought is not a profound one. The questions that remain are many: Are deities identifiable in the early Postclassic Maya period as incontrovertibly as Hindu deities can be ca. A.D. 650? How many Maya deities are there? What is the function of each? What are their symbolic attri- butes? Is there agreement among Mesoamericanists about these? Are they consistent enough for purposes of identifica- tion? What is the evidence (other than in perhaps four plausible cases) that the personages represented in Maya art are deities rather than priest-kings or secular figures? The writings of Proskouriakoff (1950), Benson (1973), and Thompson (1970) and the background of evolutionary relationships in Meso- american religious art and iconography summarized by several authors during a recent symposium (Nicholson 1976) may serve as initial reference points. Kelley will have to produce more than guesses to justify his equivalences of the Maya Series G glyphs with the Aztec deities and those of the more recent Zapotec calendar from Oaxaca. The attributes of these deities loom large in his scheme of Hindu parallels. Caso (1965:946), unconcerned with Hindu comparisons, of course, has suggested a set of Zapotec-Aztec equivalences, but he avoids sequential alignments and includes only part of the complement of deities. Kelley (1972:53), dismissing many of Caso's equivalences as "not very compelling, although all are reasonable," proposes his own set. Caso and Kelley (or others venturing their opinions) may each be partiallv correct; yet the problem of equivalences and sequences leaves as much room for subjectivity as do the vastly better- documented iconographic and conceptual variations of the Hindu (leities. Mesoamericanists will almost certainly agree that a clear consensus exists neither on the equivalences nor on the sequences of Maya G glyphs, Aztec deities, and Zapotec deities, inter se. In his latest work, Kelley (1976:88, 92) writes as if his opinion constituted evidence of the correctness of his own sequential alignment of "the Aztec names with their charac- teristic Oaxacan equivalents." He admits that "unfortunately, no one has yet managed to satisfactorily equate the Aztec deities with the Maya glyphic series"-and this despite the close geographic, temporal, and cultural affinities of these three subdivisions of Mesoamerican civilization. How odd that he then proceeds to prop up his Mesoamerican "equivalences" with further conjectures (on which he is even more vulnerable) by invoking a totally different civilization from overseas! "On the basis of Hindu parallels," says he, "I have recently argued that G1 corresponds to Itzli and so on through the sequence (Kelley 1972)." As for his broad statements on borrowings, modifications, and creations of new patterns of culture traits, I can only voice agreement-provided that ancestral Asian cultures hailing 576 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="37">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA from the south of roughly 500 north latitude do not enter the (pre-Spanish conquest) picture. I must emphasize a specific issue: Kelley thinks he can recognize modified survivals of Hindu religious traditions in Mesoamerica. I, for reasons given in detail, submit that Kelley's discriminative choice among the available alternatives is, to begin with, poor and that he "arbitrarily" stretches his imagination until the "modified Hindu patterns" of symbols fit his schemes of parallels. On Kelley's final point: I remark in my article that Kelley's hypothesis undoubtedly possesses a superficial attractiveness. Nonetheless, scholars lacking the specialized knowledge of Hindu traditions who reject Kelley's view without examination merely because, as he says, it depends on specialized knowledge probably do not far outnumber those who do examine it and are apt to be "seduced." At least one Mesoamericanist, whom I answer below, falls into this category. I did not include Kelley's 1960 article in my discussion because his Hindu-Mesoamerican comparisons were quite brief and, in any case, were partly revised for his extensive 1969 paper. It contains little that is not speculative and has not been said or implied subsequently. I strove for high information density consistent with accuracy and the printing space avail- able. After all, my critique summarizes, in addition to my own, the ideas of three authors, each of whom has written more than one extensive paper on the subject. The inquisitive reader will note in the bibliography of Kelley's 1960 article two good Indological works (Macdonell 1897 and Hopkins 1915) and wonder why he did not use them better. One example from each will suffice. A glance through their pages cannot fail to convince one that rigid characterization of the Vedic deities is an impossibility. More than simple me- tonymy is involved, as I have explained in my critique. The reader will also discover that Kelley has a penchant for con- jecture and misrepresentation even when clear meanings and accurate information exist in the Hindu literature: For Aja ekapad, several unambiguous associations are known-aerial, aquatic, celestial, etc.-which obviously wreck Kelley's logic. He bypasses all these prominent, normal associations to choose the literal term "one-footed goat," ignoring Macdonell's clear indications (pp. 73-74) that Sanskrit lexicographers have disputed this connotation of Aja ekapad and that it is legiti- mately applicable to the deities Agni and Siva. Hopkins (p. 170) is both accurate and explicit about the Vasus-these deities "never vary in number. There are eight Vasus."-but Kelley insists on seeing nine. This whimsical version of Hindu mythol- ogy is repeated in 1969 (p. 159), when the Vasus inspired revised thinking at a point where abandonment of the erroneous number nine would have been disastrous to the invention of a new "parallel." To sum up: Kelley's task now seems clear-cut. To maintain his present position, he has to show (a) that I am substantially wrong in my interpretation or presentation of the Hindu, and where necessary the relatively less crucial Mesoamerican, evidence; (b) that the sources I have relied upon are of little or no consequence; (c) that his own sources, though they are very few, are sufficient to establish the correctness of his analogies, to the extent that the alternatives brought to his attention in my critique do not count; and (d) why he thinks Mesoamericanists who differ from him in their views of very early pantheons may be in error. Hard data, rather than hypotheses conjectured to nourish an earlier hypothesis, would be useful. When, for instance, Kelley begins a sentence or interrupts it with an "I think.. ." (as he habitually does), his ideas are welcome as transient suppositions to test a possi- bility-for this is standard scientific method-provided that he does not labor under the belief that they constitute evidence. I have pointed out numerous cases where he fails precisely on this score. Henderson, too, in his comment, criticizes Kelley for using Hindu "data" to elucidate complex Maya symbols as if he had already demonstrated a relationship between the two. The objections I raise in my critique are grave. They call attention to crucial segments of diffusionist writings that impinge not only on the subject matter of cultural anthropology but also on methodology. To be credible, diffusionists must show that their tenets can withstand challenges. Kelley, for his part, must explain apparent inconsistencies and contra- dictions in his own presentations of data, especially those which are unambiguous in the original sources. How can he justify withholding a crucial word from a citation used to bolster a case of alleged parallelism when disclosure of that word would have destroyed the logic of his argument? An illustration of this occurs under point 5 of my discussion of the navagraha4. I may point out another breach of scholarly propriety by giving an example not mentioned in my critique. Kelley (1974:142, italics mine) assures us that "recent evidence has shown that the reliability of the life of Apollonius is quite high and the story suggests that the seven-day week was known in India at that time." On the contrary, Colson (1926: 23), Kelley's source, states that the origins of the story, its literary source, and even the connection of its author with Apollonius "have always been a moot question." Kelley includes no other reference to support its "quite high" reli- ability. How, then, can he sustain his intricate web of con- jectures? Why does he persistently speak of a "Hindu nine-day week" when such a division of time has never existed? Why does he refer to the Vasus of the nakfatra list as a group of nine deities when every Indological source tells us that they are eight in number? These and other distortions reflect quite incomplete, if genuinely motivated, preparation for research on a difficult theme. The fact remains, however, that Kelley's edifice of "arbitrary parallels" is built upon this kind of shaky groundwork. Coe's logic is perplexing. His posture, however, is under- standable, since he seems committed to upholding his belief (Coe 1975: 30) that "some aspects of [Mesoamerican astronomy] may have been the result of diffusion." While there have been few objections to my assertions from other Mesoamericanists no less expert than he, Coe has several. The more relevant of these questions, however, remain unresolved. He advances my deficiencies (real or debatable) in this area as reasons for his lack of confidence in my presentation of an Indological case against trans-Pacific diffusion of culture from South Asia. He admits at the outset his helplessness regarding the Hindu data. This shortcoming did not prevent him from pronouncing (pp. 30-31, italics mine) that "Kelley has made the ingenious suggestion that the sequence of twenty named days may be a reduction of an oriental system of 28 lunar mansions." Is not Coe's support of Kelley, despite his inability to evaluate complex features of Hinduism-the crux of Kelley's "arbitrary parallels"-proof of premature judgment? He faults my stand as tendentious, the very word I self- consciously use in an introductory paragraph stressing that diffusionist claims of "evidences" leave no alternative. The last sentence in his comment sanguinely predicts a vindication of diffusionist claims of homology. As Paddock asks, "What, then, are some of the psychic needs met by a diffusionist stance?" Let us, however, first attend to the more urgent points raised by Coe: 1. Thompson (1960:208) used the same expressions as I have. Glyph G does appear among lunar series expressions on. monuments (p. 237). Aside from this and the fact that no other commentator considers this point critical, the situation before us is simple: showing the invalidity i f cemparisons of the "G1-G9 glyphic series of Mayan Lords" with the "Hindu Gods of the Nine Planets" (Kelley's own expressions) was my only concern. 2. When Bardawil publishes his work, we will know whether the claims Coe makes on his behalf are credible. Persons Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978</page><page sequence="38">knowledgeable in Hindu iconography will certainly be amazed by a thesis that Maya hand gestures are "quite comparable to the mudrd of Hindu-Buddhist art" even though it is now well known that there is a total absence of a host of other iconographic symbols capable of inciting further interest in "parallels." 3. All the Mayanists known to Coe may identify Classic Maya sculptures as rulers, but I got the idea that they may represent priest-kings (or -rulers) from Thompson's (1973:55- 57) synopsis of many years of study of the Maya. Halach uinic or ahau, i.e., chief rulers, he says, were both secular and religious leaders. Hieroglyphic tqxts and sculptured scenes at Yaxchilan and elsewhere suggest that this system is traceable to the Classic period. The Relaci6n de Izamal (Relaciones de Yucatdn) describes the halach uinic Tutul Xiu as a priest of the idols. The Motul Dictionary, says Thompson, indicates that the halach uinic had both secular and religious functions. He was referred to specifically as ah kin, "priest." He super- vised sacrifices and served as judge of appeal. "There is full evidence ... for the sacerdotal functions of a halach uinic," says Thompson amid much other detail. The notion that these historical personages were either deities or mere rulers can hardly be entertained if one accepts his interpretation. 4. The reader should refer to Kubler, who discusses this point in relation to the murals at Cacaxtla in the forthcoming proceedings of the third Mesa Redonda de Palenque. One may or may not agree with him, but I am not qualified to hold a firm opinion on this matter. I have recognized early in this reply that some rudiments of the calendar may have been shared by different Mesoamerican cultures, including that of Teotihuacan. 5. I have cited Garibay (1959) and Sejourne (1957) precisely on this point. I have explicitly acknowledged the "similarities" but urged caution and underlined that they prove nothing. Garibay, whose understanding of Hinduism is apparent from his essay, feels as I do and declines to homologize superficial features that, to the reckless, might seem "striking." Coe, I am certain, will agree if he consults the pertinent Indological treatises I have cited. 6. Goetz and Morley (1950:18-19), in their introduction to the English version, from the Spanish translation by Adrian Recinos, of the Popol Vuh, state: The influence of the Bible is evident in the description of the creation, although this does not succeed in taking away the indigenous flavor of the Quiche book. Commenting on the edition of the Popol Vuh by Brasseur de Bourbourg, Adolf Bandelier observed in 1881 that the first sentences appear to be transcriptions of the Book of Genesis and are not aboriginally American. He argues that in the epoch in which the Popol Vuhl was written the Indians of Guatemala were already under the influence of the paintings, books, and chants which the Spanish missionaries used to instruct them in Christianity. The native author expressly declares, in the Preamble of this work, that he is writing under Christianity. The editor of the Spanish translation of the French text of Brasseur de Bourbourg has carefully noted the concordance of its first chapter with the Book of Genesis. Max Muller had previously (1878) referred to certain similarities between the Popol Vuh and the Old Testament, but although admitting that there was Biblical influence in this book, he believes that it must be recognized that its content was a true product of the intellectual soil of America. Edmonson's (1971) translation of and annotations to the Popol Vuh are also quite unambiguous as to the Christian influences in this Quiche work (for example, line 45, pp. 6-7; line 2107, p. 72; line 8582, p. 255). I mentioned the underworld gods of destruction on the authority of Anders (1963:143). He lists seven such pairs from the Popol Vuh. Each consists of males only, unlike the Hindu dvandva representations, which may be uni- or bisexual (for examples, Harihara and Ardhanari?vara). Further, the significance of the latter is celestial, never that of the underworld. 7. I make no such assumption, at least not with the same implications. I merely question, with other Mesoamericanists, the intelligibility of these sources. Broda confirms this in her comment. 8. "Proboscis" and "snout" are synonymous in the Concise Oxford Dictionary; in fact, the latter word is given both oral and nasal connotations. The point, in any case, is trivial. Even so, it is not I but Kelley (1972:61) who should yield to Coe, for in violation of the latter's semantic subtlety he compares the Maya Chacs with the rain gods of India, who, according to him, "were elephants." 9. The term "pre-Nahuatl" was suggested by Paddock (I take responsibility for its use) during a prepublication review of my manuscript. Few Mexicanists will dispute the serpent's pluvial symbolism or its very early origins. I will elaborate upon its cosmological symbolism elsewhere. 10. Thompson's (1970) authority is unassailable here. He says (p. 198), "In considering the nature of Maya gods, we may first rid ourselves of certain misconceptions by noting that in our field the term pantheon should not be taken in its strictly Greek sense. The idea of a general assembly of gods finds no place in Maya theology." The reader should also recognize the significance of the arguments made under the third point in my reply to Kelley, above. Opinion is so divided on the matter of Classic Maya deities and the place of animistic beliefs in their cults that it is surprising to find Coe even venturing to insist that "the Maya pantheon was just as large and complex as that of Hindu India." Gopinatha Rao (1914), Banerjea (1956) and innumerable original manuscripts on Hindu iconography reflect a precision of description, categorization, nomenclature and ritual worship of deities unknown in Maya studies. 11. Coe seems to exploit my omitting to mention (in my abstract?) the vague solar-year calendar (18 X 20 + 5). My principal concern was with the 260-day sacred calendar (13 X 20), and my challenges to Kelley and Kirchhoff involve con- sideration primarily of the symbolism of the 20 named days. This is obvious in the body of my article. I am perfectly aware that the 260-day ritual cycle is not a "month"! I must take brief note of two comments, by Cohodas and Jairazbhoy. Cohodas irresponsibly speaks of my efforts as "competitive backbiting." Surely, he has misconstrued the purpose of a critique. Readers can judge me independently on his first point. He does not represent me accurately on his second, which, even otherwise, is hardly germane to the real issue. He offers no specific arguments. He says that my critique "will not foster cross-cultural harmony," as if that is mainly what he expected from it! Finally, as peacemaker, he urges us to "sit down together and objectively examine the evidence" [to contribute to] "the advancement of knowledge." Is not CA a respectable enough forum for his thoughts? Jairazbhoy sidetracks my calendrical theme completely but exploits the hospitality of CA columns to publicize his own book, which alleges that the Olmecs were under the influence of both Shang China and Ramessid Egypt. He now says that the Hindus, too, diffused their art into Mesoamerica. Even so, his viewpoint might have been of interest and sparked a response were it not for the circumstance that I, for one, find it impossible to take his utterances seriously. I have indicated why (CA 18:340). The reviews of his book by Adovasio (1975), Bushnell (1975), Bray (1977), and Daniel (1977), whose opinions of it I fully share, only fortify my present indifference. My critique seizes upon frailties in diffusionists' proposals that depend primarily on speculation. Their logic, as I believe I have shown without erecting a counterhypothesis, can be questioned through clear literary evidence from an exceptionally rich Indian and Southeast Asian repertory. I have debated Kelley, Kirchhoff, and Barthel using the same criteria as they plus much more of the same type of Hindu religious and his- 578 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="39">Mundkur: ALLEGED DIFFUSION OF HINDU SYMBOLS TO MESOAMERICA torical data than they muster to uphold their conjectures. This is not to decry conjecture. It has had its place in intellectual history. Many great discoveries in science and geographical exploration owe their origins at least in part to whim like that of those who draw parallels between Mesoamerican concepts or works of art and those of India and Southeast Asia and consider the resemblances "striking." A bas-relief at El Tajin, Mexico, showing two "deity-like" figures holding ends of a serpent around a pillar or tree between them, has given rise to the suggestion, at a conference (see CA 19:204), that the scene might represent the Hindu myth of the churning of the ocean of milk for its elixir. The extreme paucity in Mesoamerica of motifs that invite such fanciful comparisons is well known. Yet nary a thought is given to the complete absence of epigraphy or art that betrays the craftsmanship of, or even minimal supervision by, the persons most directly involved in diffusing their religious ideology and art. The Asian donors, we might reasonably expect, would have demanded (for they were allegedly powerful enough to inspire imitation) adherence to conceptual features that might have lent some credibility to diffusionists' comparisons. I have never been more convinced of the uniqueness of Mesoamerica, in its particular historical contexts, than after three summers in Mexico and Guatemala, spent in admiring pre-Columbian art and architec- ture. At no time did these toucb a sensitive Hindu chord in me. Diffusionists, I must admit, have an advantage over persons who are accustomed to gathering and analyzing data more fastidiously than they. The diffusionist can take refuge in the conviction that a diffused foreign trait may undergo complex modification to the point where he (better than anyone else) can recognize a case of authentic borrowing. Lest I be dubbed a blind "antidiffusionist," let me hasten to point out that I recognize that innumerable authenticated cases of diffusion of culture are known in the Old World despite the circumstance that geographic obstacles and accidents of history discouraged such diffusion. Yet, flights of fancy no less extraordinary than those I point out in my critique are detectable in diffusionist writings involving countries with indubitable commercial links, direct or indirect. Two examples involving ancient India illustrate this. The first case is that of Apedemak, the serpent-bodied, lion- headed (occasionally human-bodied) god of Meroe, in the ancient empire of Kush, in Nubia. India had maritime connec- tions with dynastic Egypt, Kush's cultural model and immediate neighbor to the north. This is the basis of a belief held by some that the iconography of Apedemak betrays a diffusion of Hindu religious ideas to Kushite Nubia. Zabkar (1975:36-51) not only shows the dubiousness of this view but also convincing- ly points out the great similarities in Kushite and Egyptian iconography which zealots of diffusionism overlook in their eagerness to detect correspondences with distant India. Numer- ous Egyptian divinities, including Sekhmet, Wepset, Isis, Renenutet, and Nephthys, have been represented in much the same manner as the ophidian-feline Apedemak. Zabkar, I believe, is correct in refuting Hindu influence in Kush on these and similar criteria. There is not a single serpent-bodied, lion- headed individual in the well-categorized assemblage of Hindu deities. The second case involves the history of iron smelting. Several early diffusionists who espoused the view, still entertained, that the Hittites once enjoyed a monopoly of this process held that the technology was too complicated to be separately invented in different regions. Ironworking is said to have diffused to India through her western neighbors, Babylonia and Phoenicia. In a recent thoughtful analysis, Chakrabarti (1976) reviews philological, archaeological, metallographic, and chemical in- formation which casts doubt on this view. He argues, with the aid of Brahmanical texts, that India was a separate and inde- pendent center of early ironworking and that the current diffusionist view is totally inadequate. Credence is lent to his argument by archaeology. In South and Central India, where Anatolian, Mesopotamian, and Phoenician contacts seem extremely doubtful during the period, ironworking is datable to 1100-1000 B.C., but in northern India, which did have links with Mesopotamia, iron smelting is attested at a later period. Cases like these occur not only because of India's important geographical position and cultural contacts in the ancient world, but also because certain crucial details of historical events remain unknown or are incompletely documented. The relations between Hindu and Greek astronomy, as I point out both in my critique and in my reply to Kelley, are not reliably established. Long before Das (1928) and others called attention to this, Mitra (1974), in a paper often neglected in astronomical literature, cast heavy doubt on the attributes of yavana, often taken to mean "Greek." He showed with an analysis of the Sanskrit literature that this term was also applied to peoples other than the Greeks-in particular, to Assyrians, Medes, and Persians, peoples from the "West of Kandahar." Indeed, the dictionary meaning is a revealing one: the word implies "any foreigner, or barbarian . .. applied at present to a Mahomedan or a European also" (Apte 1890:890a). "There is not a tittle of evidence," states Mitra (p. 279) "that it was at any one time the exclusive name of the Greeks." In addition (p. 277), Ptolemaios [Ptolemy] "is nowhere mentioned in Hindu astronomy or astrology." He also questioned the authenticity of al-Biruni's rendition of Sanskrit terms and names of Hindu personages because of the evident trans- mogrifications brought about by Semitic script. In regard to "Indo-Greek astronomy," however, the extent to which the former political and educational domination of India by the British (with their admiration of Greek culture) may have given rise to incorrect, or partly correct yet incomplete, infor- mation propagated by diffusionist writers is an unknown factor. Kelley shows an unawareness of the literature and historical background when making his sweeping conclusions. A similar deficiency can be shown regarding his statements on the naklatra symbols in Burma, Indonesia, Cambodia, and elsewhere in Asia. The variations in these countries, springing as they do from Hindu India, are indeed "less important and wholly ancillary" for the purpose of showing the fallacies in diffusionist thought. It is the original Indian system which Kirchhoff and Kelley initially stress, and justifiably so. The type of reasoning they apply to the variant systems and symbols is no different, and it crumbles simultaneously. The diffusionist whose criteria are conceptual may be un- aware of information existing at levels that he has not reckoned with. The data latent in historical, ethnographic, and scientific studies which undermine his assumptions are often obscure. In the Mesoamerican context, it seems to me that the cultural anthropologist who speaks solely in terms of the flow of cul- tures, psychological factors, inventiveness, borrowings, modifi- cations, comparisons of deity lists, linguistics, and the like is, to begin with, at a disadvantage. In this regard, I cannot improve upon the very pertinent, entirely acceptable viewpoint summarized in Paulsen's comment. Though I have not felt the need for it in this critique, I am convinced that neglect of the scientific, particularly the genetic- demographic, evidence can be a serious flaw. I have drawn attention to this earlier.' Diffusionists whose outlook is exclu- 1 Agogino, in his comment, ambivalently mentions the criterion of osteology in support of the view that pre-16th-century influences are undetectable in Mesoamerica, while arso saying "in defense of the proponents of trans-Pacific migration" that the few bones available for study do not rule out foreign influences. Actually, osteological studies have many drawbacks, aside from the difficulty of locating enough "foreign" skeletons for results of any significance. Stewart (1973) has a useful summary of the situation. He states (p. 180), "I find it difficult to believe that any Asiatics who might have crossed Vol. 19 * No. 3 * September 1978</page><page sequence="40">sively that of cultural anthropology are, understandably, tardy in relating their thoughts to the large body of data from the biological sciences bearing on human settlement in the Western Hemisphere. At present, the evidence offers little or no encouragement to them. I am, however, no fanatic. I feel that any data, even when they engender surmise, must be judged on their own merits first, and only then against a background of other data. I do not favor stifling conjecture (merely because it is conjecture) by invoking science. I only ask that diffusionists temper their pronouncements with some appreciation of the findings of science, and especially of the constraints under which an investigator may speculate when using the scientific method in his reasoning. "What, then, are some of the psychic needs met by a diffu- sionist stance?" is the question addressed to the reader by Paddock in his philosophical appraisal of the implications of arguments against Hindu influences in Mesoamerica. He has eloquently preempted my own thought. The concept of calendri- cal borrowings and derivations from India and Southeast Asia, along with the inherent religious symbolism, is but a part of the romantic and visionary aura which earlier had given birth to the hypothesis of trans-Pacific diffusion of motifs of religious art. This aura may perhaps turn out to be the greatest obstacle to conscientious reexamination of the soundness of the concept by its proponents and supporters. This thought had not crystallized in my mind until I read the comments of Barthel and Stewart. Until the latter publishes his Ph.D. dissertation or other work, I will, on the basis of the reasoning in his comment, assume that he does not substantially differ from his teacher, Kelley. I will therefore refrain from pointing out his errors and let the reader judge the extent to which he recasts my statements. Barthel has elsewhere an- nounced a forthcoming journal to be called Indo-Mexicana. Whether the goal of his activities is a truly impartial interest in the question of trans-Pacific culture diffusion, even to the extent of abandoning the present absurd forms of the hypothe- sis, or an entrenchment of those forms we do not know. Until this has been established, one may reasonably assume that Barthel has a vested interest in preserving, howsoever he can (as the trend of his comment suggests), the notion of Hindu calendric influences in Mesoamerica that Kelley propounded 18 years ago. I am glad, however, that he intends to refute my arguments in detail. Instead of doing so in a German periodical, as he hopes to, I would suggest, as I have to Kelley, that he follow my example and expose his reasoning to the scrutiny of scholars through the columns of CA. It would afford us the opportunity of knowing what his German colleagues, who have watched the development of his thesis at closer range, think of his prolific output vis-a-vis the few elemental questions that stand in opposition at its foundations. As for myself, I feel that I have voiced my salient objections with sufficient clarity consistent with modest goals. What is more important, however, is that not only Indologists in India and elsewhere, but also readers concerned with general problems of trans-Pacific contacts should be satisfied that my critique is in good taste and that it reflects scholarly discernment. Short of my accountability for what I have expressed in it, I have no ideological stake in the topic of diffusion of cultures. My interest was transient, and I will move on to other areas in the humani- ties. Like the merely visual arguments for trans-Pacific diffu- sions, the conceptual arguments, too, at present seem un- persuasive. References Cited ABHYANKAR, K. V. 1976.
