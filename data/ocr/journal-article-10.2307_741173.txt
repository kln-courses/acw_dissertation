<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEED SYMBOLISM ON EURASIAN STRING INSTRUMENTS By THEODORE C. GRAME and GEN'ICHI TSUGE E VEN the casual browser through a museum gallery containing musical instruments soon becomes aware that certain instruments possess clearly defined anthropomorphic or zo6morphic symbolism; how- ever much these obvious visual delights may grip the imagination of the amateur, the phenomenon has generally been subsumed by organologists under the rubric of "decoration." By this they perpetuate the notion of our technological society that instruments are simply tools for the pro- duction of sound. The musicians of other areas and other ages would not agree with such a definition: in Sweden - and quite recently - the player of the nyckelharpa "regarded his instrument as a living thing and gave it a woman's name. Its eyes were the sound holes and the instru- ment has to be hung with these the right way up."' Quotations of this kind could be multiplied ad infinitum and the point in all cases would be the same: it is a routine matter in many societies to define a musical instrument not as a sound-producing tool but rather as a "sounding statue" - as one of the authors has previously termed it.2 The extent to which an instrument possesses anthro- or theriomorphic meaning (whether symbolic, conceptual, or psychological) differs markedly from area to area and from era to era. What is completely obvious in the exuberant and explicit carvings surmounting certain African 3 and Celtic harps,' Mongol fiddles,5 South Indian vinas,6 or viole da gamba7 is 1 J.

We have found this last category to include rich and totally unmined sources for the organologist; indeed, in the deliberately specialized and restricted study that follows we will lean most heavily upon such evidence. Even the "scientific" system of nomen- clature practiced by European scholars and instrument-makers indicates an anthropomorphic point of view; members of the lute family possess bellies, backs, and necks. The ordinary European violin is a member of a large and variegated group of instruments so tenuously related morphologically that the only real linkage is provided by their common use of the horsehair bow. Like other lutes it is provided with the English-language nomenclature that we mentioned above; it has a back, a belly, and a neck. It also has ribs, a pegbox cheek, and scroll eyes.' Thus far the instrument could repre- sent either anthro- or theriomorphic symbolism. Further investigation discloses that the violin has in addition a saddle, a tailpiece, and a tail- pin."0 Let us assume for the moment that the words back, belly, neck, and so on, are merely handy appellations devised by scholars and instru- ment makers. Even if this is the case, what are we to make of the words saddle and tail? If we give any weight at all to this nomenclatural evi- dence, we are compelled to admit the possibility that the violin is some- how a steed symbol; additional material assembled by the authors, and reaching from easternmost to westernmost Eurasia, shows that this steed symbolism is far indeed from being an isolated phenomenon. It is a remarkable coincidence that from one end of Eurasia to the other the name for the bridge or the stringholder of the instruments of the lute family is often the local word for a steed; most often it is a horse, but the terms for ass and even camel are encountered on occasion. The phenomenon is not confined only to Eurasia; similar nomenclature is found in parts of Africa. In the following pages we shall examine in Mongols, part I, (Stockholm, 1943), pl.

Then we shall attempt to provide a theoretical framework for the existence of this phenomenon. (The bridge is defined by Sachs as "usually a wooden crosspiece wedged on edge between the soundboard and the lower part of the strings, in order to hold the strings away from the soundboard and to transmit the vibrations of the strings to the soundboard." The stringholder is the terminal point to which the strings are fastened; it is usually fastened directly to the belly of the instrument.) In East Asia we can point out many instances in which the bridge of instruments of the lute family is called by the name meaning "horse." In China the bridges of both the hu-chin (fiddle) and the san hsien (skin-bellied long lute) are called ma, which means "horse." In the Ryukyu Islands, which are thought to have imported the Chinese long lute from the continent, the bridge of the sanshin (the Ryukyuan version of the san hsien) is again called uma, "horse." The Ryukyuan version of the Chinese san hsien was introduced to Japan about the middle of the sixteenth century, where influenced mainly by the wood-bellied lute, the biwa (Chinese p'ip'a), it was re- modeled into a Japanese form which came to be known as the shamisen.13 The bridge of the shamisen is known in Japanese as koma, which orig- inally meant "colt." This terminology is by now well-established in Japan, and the bridge of other instruments, including that of the Western violin, is called koma." Even the frets of the Japanese short lute, the biwa, are sometimes designated with this term."5 In sum, then, the common term for bridges of a number of Far Eastern plucked and bowed lutes is also the word for horse, or colt; we should notice that these instruments are in every case comparatively recent arrivals in the Far East, though the short lute, as represented by the biwa, is far older than the long lute in this area. In South India, "the violin has become an integral part of any musical concert of Karnatak music where it accompanies the main artist, 11 Curt Sachs, The History of Musical Instruments (New York, 1940), p. 466. 12 Hisao Tanabe, Nippon no Gakki [Encyclopedia of Japanese Musical Instru- ments] (Tokyo, 1964), p. 124. 13 Eishi Kikkawa, "Sangen Denrai K6" [The Introduction of the Shamisen into Japan], in TOy6 Ongaku Kenkyd (Journal of the Society for Research in Asiatic Music), no. 14-15, (Tokyo, 1958). 14 Article "Koma" [Bridge], in Ongaku-Jiten [Heibonsha Edition Encyclopedia of Music] (Tokyo, 1959), pp. 1045-46. '5 The stringholder of the biwa, on the other hand, is called fukushu, "covering hand."</page><page sequence="4">60 The Musical Quarterly vocal or instrumental." 1' The English terminology for the parts of the violin has accompanied the instrument itself to Madras, the center of Karnatak music, though sometimes the Tamil or Telugu terms are still used by older musicians. For instance, the Tamil word kudirai, "horse," is sometimes used for the bridge of the Western violin. The bridge, how- ever, has another name as well in Tamil; this word, mefttu (which originally means "step"), is no doubt borrowed from the frets of the vina, whereas the bridge of the vina itself is called pita, something to sit on." Again, the bridge of the North Indian vina (bin) is known as the ghudach, meaning "horse." Moreover, this word seems to be widely accepted in the North as the name for the bridges of such other instru- ments as the sarangi (fiddle), and the long lute, the sitar." We see, therefore, that words meaning "horse" are widely accepted both in North and South India as designations for the bridge; we should, however, also like to highlight the use of the word pita for the vina-bridge; we shall encounter similar terminology elsewhere. The bridge of the Persian sehtar - an alleged ancestor of the Indian sitar - is known as kharak, which means "little donkey" in Persian."e Further, the bridge of the skin-bellied long lute, the tar,19 is called by the same name, as for that matter are the bridges of most other Persian chordophones, including the movable bridges of the santur (dulcimer). In Turkey, esik, "threshold," is the generic term for bridge of stringed instruments. However, the Persian term herek (=-kharak, "little don- key") is remembered still today by some old musicians, such as Asik Veysel. A hypothesis that the term esik might be derived from esek, "donkey," seems too far-fetched according to native Turkish speakers, though, in the Arabic script, both esik and esek are spelled the same. Another term, k6prii, should be mentioned here. This seems to be a direct translation from the English term "bridge." In Egypt, the string- holder of the 'ifd is known as faras, "horse" ;20 in the Maghrib the string- holder is called ihamar, "donkey," as is the bridge of the Arab rabab.21 In the desert area of Mauritania, where the horse is of little utility, the xe S.

In modern Greece, the bridge of an instrument is usually known as yefira, meaning 'bridge," but the word kavalldri is alloted to the bridge of the lyra (fiddle)." In his Reallexikon der Musikinstrumente, Curt Sachs gives (in the article "Steg") twenty-one names for the bridge in vari- ous European languages, and among these names we find a number that denote a steed." In Russian, Ruthenian, Polish, and Czech the word is kobylka, "little mare"; related words are encountered in other Slavic languages such as Serbo-Croatian (kobilica) and Slavonic (kobyla),25 In Bulgarian the term is magarentse, meaning "foal of an ass"; 2 in Albanian the word gomarice means "she-ass." 27 Other related terms encountered in European languages include, of course, the French chevalet and the Portuguese cavallete.8 In Finland the bridge is known as hepo, "horse," and in one part of Norway the bridge of the harding- fele is known as the hest, "horse." 29 Elsewhere in Scandinavia the mat- ter is somewhat more obscure. The Swedish word stall, for example, is applied to the bridge of the bowed instrument, the nyckelharpa; 30 this word means "stable" and, hence, can be seen as being possibly tenuously related to the idea of a steed. In Norway, however, the most common name for the fiddle-bridge is stol, "chair." It is obvious that stall and stol may be somehow interconnected. There are probably many more terms for the bridge similar in meaning to those that we have given above; it is doubtful, however, that their discovery will do much to change the distribution map, which already shows that words meaning steed are encountered from one end of Eurasia to the other, as well as in northern Africa. If we return to our original question regarding the anthropomorphism or theriomorphism of the violin (as displayed by its English nomenclature), it would seem that the word saddle, when fitted into a broad geographical context, 2 H.

It is possible to pursue other nomenclatural matters in order to round up still other beastly attributes: the Swedish nyckelharpa possesses a sadel;31 the Swedish tallharpa may be a "tail-harp." 32 Another sort of evidence is provided by the following Welsh bardic text of 1581: "For my harp is made of a good mare's skin / The strings be of horsehair; it maketh a good dyn." 3" In an exhaustive work dealing with the miniature painting on European medieval manuscripts, there are many delineations of, and references to, instruments played by animals including dogs, cats apes, lions, and asses. It is odd - and perhaps not without significance - that the horse (however everyday a creature he may have been in Europe) is shown only infrequently; when he is pictured in a musical context, he invariably plays a vielle.14 This bit of esoterica aside, the iconographic matters that we have here to deal with involve instruments decorated with horse-carvings; these do not seem to be as widely distributed as those with bridges named after steeds. Indeed, the extreme west of Europe, East Asia, and Africa are absent from this category. In western Europe, for example, the carvings surmounting viols, for instance, tend to be anthropomorphic (some would say under the influence of a general and pervasive anthropomorphism); in Norway the hardingfele (though its bridge is a hest) is nearly always surmounted with the archaic dragon symbol (dreki) of the Nordic peoples. In the Far East, too, ancient and elaborate tradition has prescribed the symbolism of nearly every part of a musical instrument, and no room has been left for the symbols of such johnny-come-lately instruments as fiddles.35 Nearly all of the instruments that we know of with horse-carvings come from areas that are bounded on the east by Mongolia and Tibet, and on the west by Lithuania and the Balkans. The list includes, besides Mongolia and Tibet, the Caucasus, Hungary, the Balkans, and Lith- uania. One therefore suspects that the phenomenon originated amongst those Central Asian peoples - Mongols and others - to whom the horse has been of an all-encompassing cultural, religious, and economic importance - the so-called horse cultures. Of the examples that we have 31 Ibid. 3a H.

The word horse does not always mean an animal of the family Equidae, but sometimes means something else associated with the horse. In English, for example, it means also "something on which a person rides, sits, or exercises, as if on a horse's back"; or "a frame, block, etc. with legs on which something is mounted or in chess a "knight." In Japanese koma means not only "horse," "charger," or "colt," but also "a chessman," "a checker," "a wood piece," and, of course, "the bridge of a lute." The French word for the bridge, chevalet, means pri- marily "wooden horse for punishment" and "something to support." Thus in some cases the bridge could be named after "horse" simply because its shape or function is associated with "any support for some- thing else," and it might not be directly related to the horse as such. The English term bridge, the Italian ponticello, the Spanish puentecillo, and the German Steg belong to this category. The Danish and Norwegian stol, "chair, seat," the Telugu pita, "something to sit on," the Slovakian podstavec, "something to put under," the Russian podstdvka, "support," "rest," "foot," the Ethiopian birkumma, "something to support," and even the French chevalet may also belong to this category. Viewed in this way, the terms that we have described would be technological ones; i. e., they would describe a functional piece of equipment, a sort of saw- horse for the support of strings. Such a conclusion seems not altogether persuasive, however; why, if this were true, would the violin have a tailpiece and a saddle? In Norway, as we have seen, the hardanger fiddle has a bridge which is known in some areas as hest, "horse," in others as stol, "stool"; yet almost invariably there is a dragon carving at the scroll. The dragon symbol is, of course, an ancient one among the Norwegians: in 868 King Harald Fairhair caused a great and magnificently equipped dreki (dra- 36 The horse-headed lyre is from New Kingdom Egypt; this so far solitary example might be regarded as the product of an instrument-maker's fancy - or as an instrument built for a special occasion. 37 Sachs, The History of Musical Instruments, p. 241.</page><page sequence="8">64 The Musical Quarterly gon ship) to be built, and this must have long antedated the arrival of the fiddle on the scene.3" Yet an echo of the original significance may linger in the word hest, just as it may linger in the English tailpiece and saddle. Thus, if we grant that the fiddle may have spread east and west from Central Asian horse cultures, and that it brought its unique symbolic meanings with it, yet it may have been affected in other ways by motifs that were native to the host civilization. Thus, the hardingfele possesses a reminiscence of its Central Asian model in the name hest; yet it maintains its Scandinavian identity through its dreki-carving. A given instrument, then, may well be the bearer of several different symbolic meanings at the same time, and many of these are nowadays applied for traditional reasons, with the maker having no conscious knowledge of the hidden meanings. While the authors are not yet in a position as yet to do much more than speculate about the possible reasons for this theriomorphic phenome- non, they have noticed that in case after case the origin of musical instruments is ascribed in myth and legend to matters closely connected with the complex of ideas that includes healing, rebirth, and fertility. Thus in Indo-European conceptions the horse was "closely connected with the sun"; it "played a large part in fertility and fecundity rites." 39 In the Talmud, the horse is "salacious." 40 Again in "Norse mythology a horse was buried or burned with its owner to carry him over Hellway." 41 (This practice, of course, was widely prevalent in many parts of Eurasia.) A Mongol tale tells how the winged horse of the star-prince, exhausted and hurt, sank to earth and expired. The grieving prince, weeping, caressed the body of his steed, and while he did this, a miracle took place: the dead horse was transformed into the first khil-khuur (horse- headed Mongol fiddle)."2 Further, the pegs are called chikhe, "ear," and this may indicate "that the Mongols regard.., .the instrument as an ani- mate being." 43 However, the "bridge is supposed to be made out of the inferior jawbone of a human being. This is thought to enable the player of the instrument to 'sing' with special expressiveness."

Common to both instruments, how- ever, is the implication that the lute is the voice of fecundity and rebirth."4 APPENDIX Chordophones with Visual Horse Symbolism Name Type of Instrument Place Morin Chur fiddle Mongolia 4 Khil Khur long fiddle Mongolia 47 Gusle fiddle Yugoslavia " Dram snyantzo long lute Tibet 49 Dram snyen Dhamnyen Tramning "Kastenleier" box lyre with two horseheads Egypt, 18th dynasty 50 Lyra fiddle Crete 65 (Greece) Cimbalom zither Hungary r Balalaika lute (with two horseheads) Russia 53 Kankles psaltery (with a scroll) Lithuania " Skrabalas wooden bells (with two horseheads) Lithuania 65 45The authors must mention, in conclusion, the mysterious and "awkward" bowed instrument supposedly invented by Leonardo da Vinci and made in the shape of a horsehead.
