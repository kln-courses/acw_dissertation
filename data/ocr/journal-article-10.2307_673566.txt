<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Question of Animal Awareness. Donald Griffin. New York: Rockefeller University Press, 197 6. 135 pp. $8.95 (cloth). Harvey Sarles University of Minnesota Certain books qualify as culminations of intellectual eras. Others signal a beginning, outlining programs for thinking or research which promise to illuminate some arena of ideas at conceptual impasse. Griffin's Ques- tion attempts both. Donald Griffin is an eminent (Rockefeller University, National Academy of Sciences) biologist whose special interests are animal navigation and orientation. How do bats navigate in the dark? How do blind humans avoid objects? Do birds "know" the sky and stars? He discovered the process and coined the term "echolocation" in bats and por- poises, in which a creature actively and "literally questions its surrounds with orien- tation sounds" (p. 12). He is a firmly grounded empiricist of the sort who found himself learning to fly to observe the flight of birds. The first chapter reports on a generation of his and others' observations, how Griffin's thinking has developed and enlarged into "Expanding Horizons in Ethology." He re- counts a major aspect of this development as his "surprises" at the discoveries of "in- creasing complexities in animal behavior," beyond what he or others had expected, or even suspected. And there have been dis- coveries of quite different channels of sen- sory modalities in some animals: echoloca- tion, changes in electric fields, spatial memory, orienting by polarization patterns of blue sky. "It is [now] reasonable to inquire whether there is any end to this series of surprises" (p. 12). Griffin pleads for renewed consideration of the usual terms which surround this question. It is better, in his view, to discuss terms such as "mental experiences, mind, awareness, intention, or consciousness," in an unsophisticated manner, than to come to a premature sense that they are well under- stood. He prefers to leave these terms open, to beg closure into some indefinite future, lest we load them in ways which entail proving what has already been assumed in their definitions. In fact, Griffin takes pains throughout to show how the Question has always been circular, adducing evidence to prove its assumptions and neglecting or denying entire universes of possible observa- tions and "new" questions. Chapter 2 outlines the results of the analysis of communication between animals. From the work of the Gardners et al. with chimps and sign language, Menzel's experi- ments with chimps' ability to relay new information, to the studies of bee dances inspired by Von Frisch, it appears clear that other species communicate "symbol- ically"-in possibly the deepest, widest senses of the term. In this chapter, Griffin begins in earnest his attack on the "behavior- istic tradition in psychology" and the "com- parable reductionism in biology." In Chapter 3, "Is Man Language?" the author enters the arena of human nature, showing that the claims of human unique- ness being due to language are really debata- ble. For example, he refutes Hockett's sorts of statements about language and human-</page><page sequence="2">165 ness. Not only is the Question about ani- mals, but it has implications for how we consider human nature. ... There is no doubt that for centuries philosophers and linguists have based their most fundamental definitions of humanity on very positive assertions about what animals can and cannot do. This means that whatever students of animal communication have learned, or can learn in the future, about communi- cation behavior is directly relevant to major questions of fundamental signifi- cance to linguistics and philosophy [p. 37]. "Are Animals Aware of What They are Doing?" asks Chapter 4. The fact is that we do not know! Griffin tries to show that the only reasonable position is "agnosticism" on this issue. This chapter is an elaboration of the issues, probing the claims that human uniqueness and awareness are the same. The evidence requires an opening of discussion which most thinkers do not want opened. The important question for Griffin: "Is there evolutionary continuity of mental ex- periences?" Until this question is discussed, "We can scarcely begin to attack the nature- nurture question" (p. 62). Thus the Ques- tion is fundamental to any future considera- tion of human nature! Chapter 5 is an attempt to foresee and respond to the sorts of objections which will be raised to Griffin's arguments: Behavior- istic; Anthropomorphic; Dangers of Relaxing Critical Standards; and "So what?" objec- tions. He shows they are limited in scope, and, in some cases, can be used to argue both for and against the Question. Why do most thinkers want the Question closed? It is clear that the straitjackets on our thinking prevent us from looking and, often, from seeing what there is to see. "What are we now overlooking, as a result of comparable restrictions imposed on the questions we ask, by our basic viewpoint about the nature of animal and human behavior?" (p. 75). Thus, the deconstruction. Griffin's program, Chapter 6: "Conscious Awareness," conveys an adaptive advantage, and will be selected for, much as any other morphological or behavioral feature. There can be no cogent biological-evolutionary argument against consciousness in animals. In this brief chapter, he claims that the converse position is also interesting in the way it highlights the nature of "plausible adaptive advantage" arguments. "A stronger form" of this argument is that "any attri- bute with a selective disadvantage will al- most certainly be eliminated unless it is genetically coupled with some compensating advantage.... No selective drawbacks to conscious awareness have been demonstrated [or even] suggested" (p. 86). The final construction is entitled: "A Possible Window on the Minds of Animals." Griffin suggests the extension of the "parti- cipatory investigation" method of anthro- pologists-linguists to other species. We will need two-way communication, for a number of reasons outlined by Griffin, lest our observations be too "coarse-grained," lest we impute our hearing to other animals' uni- verses of sound. It's an important book.</page></plain_text>
