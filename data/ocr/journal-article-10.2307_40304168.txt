<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURATORIAL REPORTS AMERICAN ART The Departments of American Art enjoyed another year of successful work centered upon acquisitions, installa- tions, exhibitions, lectures, research, and writing as the staff proceeds toward its goals of final installation of all American Wing display areas and the implementation of a wide-ranging and consistent program of American art exhibition, publications, and education activities. A particular focus for both departments has been - as it will continue to be - extensive planning for installa- tion of The Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, which is underwritten by a grant from The Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. Utilizing a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the depart- ments held a number of meetings and seminars with advisors representing potential users of the facility, such as school teachers and university professors, to solicit their views on the matter. In addition, thanks to generous support from Mr. and Mrs. Paul R. Greenwood, work has proceeded toward computerizing the American collec- tion, a step which eventually will allow staff and the public ready access to collection information. Additional display spaces were completed or re- organized with the opening of the splendid 1870 Renais- sance Revival Parlor of the Wilcox mansion from Meriden, Connecticut, and the refurbishing of The Israel Sack Galleries containing early nineteenth-century furniture. The William Cullen Bryant Fellows continued their vital support of publications originating in The Ameri- can Wing, providing support funds for Design in America: The Cranbrook Vision 1925-1950, J. Alden Weir: An Ameri- can Impressionist, and John Quincy Adams Ward: Dean of American Sculpture. The Friends of the American Wing, as in the past, contributed generously to the purchases of many important American decorative arts objects. The staff of the Department of American Decorative Arts has been diligent and particularly active. Morrison Heckscher was coordinator for the very popular Rhode Island Needlework exhibition, the installation of which was made possible by Marguerite Riordan. The opening events for that exhibition were kindly underwritten by Mr. and Mrs. Herbert A. Coyne and Mr. and Mrs. Leonard Marx. A very happy result of the exhibition was the gift from Barbara Schiff Sinauer of a collection of American and English samplers, three of which had been included in the exhibition. Mr. Heckscher completed the text of the catalogue of American Furniture in the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art: Late Colonial Period: The Queen Anne and Chippendale Styles, scheduled for publication in October 1985. Mr. Heckscher also lectured widely on a broad range of decorative arts topics. Craig Miller, following up on his work on the exhibi- tion Design in America: the Cranbrook Vision, 1925-1950 and the accompanying catalogue which received five national awards in 1984-85, has begun a book dealing with Eliel Saarinen's American career. Mr. Miller has lec- tured on these and related subjects and at the same time has held a joint appointment with this department and the Department of Twentieth Century Art charged with the care of that department's design and architecture collections. Oswaldo Rodriguez Roque oversaw, with the crea- tive design assistance of Ann Winston and the help of Frances Bretter and Amelia Peck, the reinstallation of The Israel Sack Galleries and participated as principal writer and designer of treatments, scripts, and textbook chapters for a proposed telecourse on American art. Mr. Rodriguez contributed an essay, "The Last Summer's Work," to the catalogue John Frederick Kensett: An Ameri- can Master. He also wrote the introduction to the Ameri- can art volume for a forthcoming multivolume series on the Museum. Mr. Rodriguez has lectured widely on both American decorative arts and paintings. Frances Gruber Safford, active as the overseer of daily operations of the department, has also resumed her researches on early American furniture which are aimed toward publication of the catalogue of the Museum's col- lection ofthat material. She also maintains her study and overview of the collection of American silver. Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen coordinated and orga- nized, with the aid of Frances Bretter, research consul- tant, the installation of the Renaissance Revival Parlor from Meriden, Connecticut. Mrs. Frelinghuysen is proj- ect director for the forthcoming exhibition In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement, which is made possible by Meredith Corporation, with additional support from the National Endowment for the Humani- ties. She has written two essays for the exhibition cata- logue. Mrs. Frelinghuysen has supervised planning for the installation of the William Jay Bolton stained-glass window, soon to appear in The Charles Engelhard Court, which is made possible by grants from The Vin- cent Astor Foundation, Samuel H. Kress Foundation, and The Charles Engelhard Foundation. Mrs. Fre- linghuysen has lectured throughout the country on American glass and ceramics, has organized the meetings of the American Ceramics Circle (which she serves as vice-president), and is a member of the Advisory Council for the Art Museum, Princeton University. Lewis Sharp, acting in his dual role as administrator 14</page><page sequence="2">View of John Quincy Adams Ward: Dean of American Sculpture exhibition, which was made possible by Clevepak Corporation of The American Wing and curator of American paint- ings and sculpture, has overseen the Wing's daily opera- tions, managed capital projects, coordinated both departments' extensive exhibition program, and pub- lished a monograph study, John Quincy Adams Ward: Dean of American Sculpture, which was done jointly with an exhi- bition of Ward's work. He has overseen work leading to publication of a catalogue of American sculpture in the Museum's collection, a project underwritten by The Luce Fund for Scholarship in American Art and coordinated by Research Assistant Donna Hassler. Mr. Sharp also con- ducted a seminar on museology for the Parsons/Cooper- Hewitt Collaborative Masters of Arts Program, and a seminar on "American Bronze Sculpture of the Late Nineteenth Century" for the City University of New York. Doreen Bolger Burke reinstalled the mezzanine por- tion of The Joan Whitney Payson Galleries, which tempo- rarily had housed the William Merritt Chase exhibition. She also prepared an essay for the catalogue In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement, as well as act- ing as coordinator of that publication, a project that has benefited from the organizational efforts of Catherine Hoover. In a major undertaking, Mrs. Burke, with the aid of Nancy Gillette and Peter Kenny, has overseen research and planning for The Henry R. Luce Center, carried out by the staff under a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Natalie Spassky supervised the design and installa- tion of two exhibitions, Erastus Salisbury Field, organized by the Springfield (Massachusetts) Museum of Fine Arts, and George Inness, organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art. Ms. Spassky also wrote the text for a book on Mary Cassatt. She devoted much time to numerous visiting scholars who needed access to departmental files and storeroom and delivered lectures on James McNeill Whistler and Winslow Homer. Kathryn Greenthal has organized an exhibition of the sculpture of Augustus Saint-Gaudens, to be shown at the Metropolitan and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Miss Greenthal has completed the book for the exhibition titled Augustus Saint-Gaudens: Master Sculptor. Both book and exhibition have been supported generously by the Clevepak Corporation. Dale Johnson, research assistant, has devoted her efforts to reviewing and researching the collection of American miniatures for eventual exhibition of the mate- rial. As heretofore the chairman has overseen all aspects, curatorial and operational, of the Departments of Ameri- can Art. He has devoted considerable time to planning for The Luce Center, and reinstallation of The Charles Engelhard Court. He also was a member of the Museum's long-range planning study for the Division of Educa- tional Services. He was an advisory member of the Execu- tive Mansion Preservation Society and sat on the advisory committees of the Archives of American Art and the American Art Journal. He also served as a trustee of the Intermuseum Conservation Association and of Hancock Shaker Village. A significant number of important acquisitions were made by both departments during the year. A major Fulper Pottery vase was given to the Department of American Decorative Arts by descendants of William H. Fulper, who was the mastercraftsman and owner of the Fulper Pottery. A rare and fine New York armchair of about 1 770 was the bequest of Barbara Bradley Manice, a charming late eighteenth-century maple side chair was given by Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Schwartz, and a superb group of Shaker artifacts was given by Mrs. G. James Fawcett, in memory of John S. Rudd. The Friends of the 15</page><page sequence="3">American Wing also made possible the purchase of a monumental cabinet of the 1870s attributed to Daniel Pabst of Philadelphia. Madeleine Thompson Edmonds gave three highly interesting paintings, two by Jerome Thompson and one by Cephas Thompson. An anonymous donor gave the entire remaining interest in Repose, a masterwork by John White Alexander, and an extremely delicate and beauti- ful silverpoint Portrait of a Woman by Thomas W. Dewing was purchased, as was an extraordinarily fine marsh scene by Martin Johnson Heade, thanks in major part to the generosity of Mrs. Samuel Reed. John K. Howat Lawrence A.

Whitcomb of the University of Chicago. Charles K. Wilkinson, curator emeritus, who was responsible for photography and drawing on the original excavation in the 1930s, assisted and advised Dr. Whitcomb. The vol- ume brings attention to important Sasanian and early Islamic architectural remains and objects from the site. Work continues on the reinstallation of the depart- ment's collection. A major step toward the completion of the final portion of the ancient Near Eastern galleries can now be taken as a result of a generous grant from The Howard Phipps Foundation. This grant will enable us to prepare plans, models, and drawings of the gallery space southwest of the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Gallery of Assyrian Art to exhibit works of art from Anatolia, the Levant, and Arabia, as well as a display of seals and tab- lets that will feature the Mrs. William H. Moore Collec- tion of seals on loan from the Right Reverend Paul Bowl decorated with 16 -pet ale d rosette. Syria, 1st millenium b.c. Bronze. Gift of Sheldon and Barbara Breitbart (1984.453.3) Moore, Jr., bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. A space will also be designated as a changing exhibition gallery. We expect to have the initial designs, executed by Etan Manasse Associates, Inc., completed by the end of this year and an estimate of construction costs. We can then seek funds for this final stage in the display of the Museum's collection of ancient Near Eastern art. A grant from The Hagop Kevorkian Fund enables us to produce an expanded version of the popular bro- chure placed at the entrances to the galleries of ancient Near Eastern art. The new brochure will include art his- torical and archaeological information about the objects on display in the existing galleries. The year has been exceptional for the department in the number of Museum Fellows who have been with us for various periods of time. At three meetings of the Vis- iting Committee, five of the fellows spoke about their projects. In October, Jens Kroger from the Museum für Islamische Kunst in Berlin gave a summary of his work on Sasanian and Islamic glass excavated at Ctesiphon; Trudy Kawami of Columbia University presented her ideas for the reconstruction and the dating of wall paint- ings from Kuh-e Kwaja in eastern Iran. Both scholars received J. Clawson Mills Fellowships, and their projects will result in publications of these portions of the Muse- um's collection. In February, Professor Richard S. Ellis of Bryn Mawr College gave a summary of his four seasons of excavation at Gritille in southeastern Turkey, a site that is scheduled to be flooded in 1985 because of dam construction on the Euphrates. The Museum has con- tributed to the Gritille excavations since 1981 with a gift from The Adelaide Milton de Groot Fund, in memory of Rhyton in the shape of a boar. Northwestern Iran, ca. 1000 B.c. Ceramic. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. J. Gordon Douglas III (1984.319.2) the de Groot and Hawley families. At the same meeting Ezat Neghaban, visiting curator at the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, and a Norbert Schimmel Fellow, spoke about his publication of groups of objects found in tombs of the second and first millen- nia B.C. at Marlik in northwestern Iran. Finally, in May, Aykut Çinaroglu, professor at Ankara University and a J. Clawson Mills Fellow for a year, reported on the relief sculptures of the first millennium B.C. he found in the Kesjik region of central Turkey, a project which he has prepared for publication while at the Museum. Michelle 19</page><page sequence="7">I. Marcus, a Norbert Schimmel Fellow and a Ph.D. stu- dent from the University of Pennsylvania, spoke about her initial research on seals and sealings of the first mil- lennium B.C. found at Hasanlu in northwestern Iran, the subject of her dissertation. Joan Aruz, a J. Clawson Mills Fellow, prepared her doctoral dissertation, "Aegean Seals in International Context," for publication, and Zainab Bahrani was a part-time member of the depart- ment as a Hagop Kevorkian Fund Curatorial Fellow. The staff of the department has been busy with many activities. Barbara A. Porter supervised the installa- tion of stone and stucco reliefs from Palmyra and Cte- siphon in the Richard and Jonathan Sackler Study Center, making this portion of our collection, still not on display, more available to interested students and scholars. She has also helped to coordinate arrangements for the first volume of the department's cuneiform tablet publication, Cuneiform Texts in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Vol. 1: Administrative and Commercial Texts from the 3rd and 2nd Millennia B.C. y a project headed by Ira Spar. Holly Pittman this year returned to her study of Proto-Elamite glyptic, the subject of her Ph.D. disserta- tion at Columbia University. With a Museum grant she spent six weeks at the Louvre examining and recording related materials. Arrangements were concluded with the University of Pennsylvania for the publication of this dissertation, once completed, as a Special Study in the Malyan Excavation Reports series. Miss Pittman is also at work on her portion of the Museum's cuneiform tablet publication, which will include drawings and text of all seal impressions appearing on the tablets in the first vol- ume. Oscar White Muscarella was a panel discussant at the College Art Association meeting in Los Angeles con- cerning Greek and Near Eastern relationships and his article, "Fibulae and Chronology, Marlik and Assur," appeared in the Journal of Field Archaeology (Nov. 4, 1984). During the past year I returned to my work on vari- ous subjects, notably the preparation of the second vol- ume of Silver Vessels of the Sasanian Period. With a Museum grant I spent six weeks in London and Paris examining silver vessels and discussing archaeological and inscrip- tional materials with colleagues. I also took part in a sym- posium at the Institute for Asian Research of the City University of New York on "Cross-cultural Influences on Chinese Buddhist Art and Metalwork of the Fifth to Sev- enth centuries A.D.," and gave a paper at a meeting at the University of Turin on art historical and archaeological materials of Parthian and Sasanian date. Miss Pittman and I collaborated in preparing a chapter on the depart- ment's collection in a forthcoming multivolume series on the Museum. Adela Oppenheim, a departmental part-time assis- tant, did excellent work in maintaining our library files and archival materials. Nayla Ghandour assisted Miss Pittman and Aykut Çinaroglu in drawing materials for their publications. Gifts from the Colt Archaelogical Institute, Inc., and Mrs. H. Dunscombe Colt enabled us to support the Brit- ish archaelogical excavation at Tell Brak, Syria, under the leadership of David and Joan Oates. Study materials, including an assortment of pottery given by the Oateses to the Museum, supplement our own collection of Syrian antiquities. This year a number of important works of art were added to the collection. A particularly impressive and beautiful piece is a carved obsidian plaque, a Lamashtu amulet, designed to ward off the power of a fearsome female demon who was the bringer of sickness, notably to pregnant women and children. The acquisition of this truly masterful work was made possible through a gift from James N. Spear. A fuller report on the piece appears in Notable Acquisitions 1984-1985. The department's seal collection continues to grow through the generosity of Martin and Sarah Cherkasky, who have presented us with another group of seals from their collection. Initial plans are now being made by Miss Pittman for an exhibition of this collection in early 1987. Other gifts to the department listed in full below repre- sent significant additions to our collection, and we are grateful to the donors for their generous support. Prudence O.

Sulzberger, is making highly satisfactory progress, thanks to two magnanimous pledges of Armand Hammer and Ronald Lauder. We also became the beneficiaries of a generous gift by Mrs. Samuel Reed for the renovation of our departmental library facilities and offices, a project far less glamorous but sorely needed. The new library shelves will accommo- date more than twice the present number of books. This additional shelf space is absolutely essential for the incor- poration of the private library of several thousand titles of our former curator, Stephen V. Grancsay, bequeathed to us in 1981 and now in the final stages of its searching and cataloguing. Along with the installation of the library shelves went a thorough renovation, painting, and car- peting of our offices. During the past year we made a few, significant acquisitions. Worth special mention are two Germanic shield bosses from the Migration Period and particularly two splendid edged weapons: a gold-hiked Indian dag- ger of the Mughal period, early seventeenth century, encrusted with rubies and emeralds, and a superbly ele- gant eighteenth-century court sword, signed by a Paris furbisher, with a hilt of agate and onyx mounted in a cagework of Rococo scrolls. Our department contributed to several loan exhibi- tions, notably the exhibition of medieval art, Songs of Glory in the Oklahoma Museum of Arts, Oklahoma City; Powderhorns: the Southern Tradition in the Museum of Flor- ida History, Tallahassee; and Heraldry in The New- York Historical Society. The tenth triennial congress of the International Association of Museums of Arms and Military History (IAMAM) was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in September 1984. Our department was represented by Stuart W. Pyhrr, associate curator, and David G. Alexander and Leonid Tarassuk, research associates. Stuart Pyhrr, during the past year, had to dedicate most of his time, including several trips to Europe, in Two shield bosses. Germanic, ca. 500 A.D. Bequest of Stephen V. Grancsay, by exchange, and Rogers Fund (1984.184.1,2) 21</page><page sequence="9">preparation of the forthcoming loan exhibition, Liechten- stein: The Princely Collections. He also published an article about the Milanese armorer Niccolö da Silva (recorded 151 1-49) in the Museum1 s Journal. David Alexander planned, organized, and set up a small, but significant exhibition titled The Bright Side of Battle: Symbol and Ceremony in Islamic Arms and Armor in The Hagop Kevorkian Special Exhibitions Gallery. He wrote four articles on Islamic arms, one on Turban hel- mets, one on Islamic daggers, another on Damascus swords, and a fourth on the Museum's collection of inscribed mail shirts; these were published in the Muse- um's Journal and in Waffen- und Kostümkunde. He was made membre étranger, U. A. No. 041077 (Civilization of Islam) du Centre National de la Recherche Scienti- fique, Paris. Leonid Tarassuk continued his cooperation with The Art Institute of Chicago, where he catalogued and installed for exhibition the George F. Harding Collection of Arms and Armor. His essay about an Italian pow- derhorn, dated 1560 and engraved with scenes from Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, was published in ArmiAntiche. The curator traveled in Europe, in Germany and Switzerland, on a National Endowment for the Arts grant to study display techniques in preparation of our gallery renovation. He also published two articles, one on the Unicorn Tapestries in the Musée de Cluny and in The Cloisters, and one on Carpaccio's painting Young Knight, which had been exhibited at the Museum with the loan exhibition, Old Master Paintings from The Collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza. He continued to serve on the educa- tional board of the Museum's/owrna/.

On July 1 we were the recipi- ents of a most generous grant from Mrs. Shirley S. Katzenbach, who has long been a friend of the depart- ment and has given many hours of service as a volunteer tour guide. This gift of $250,000 has made possible phys- ical improvements for the department, purchases of spe- cialized equipment, opportunities for curatorial study, research and development in costume conservation, and fellowships for study in the field of costume. We are most grateful for her confidence in our department and wish to express our appreciation for her support. Gratitude must also be directed to Mrs. William F. Buckley and her committee for their exceptional service to the Museum and especially to The Costume Institute. The Party of the Year, which they organized to herald the opening of our exhibition, Man and the Horse, was an out- standing success. Mrs. Buckley has made our annual ben- efit a much-emulated model for fund-raising events in institutions across the country and around the world. Man and the Horse, the thirteenth exhibition conceived and organized by our special consultant, Diana Vreeland, was made possible by the generous sponsorship of Polo/ Ralph Lauren. Many individuals graciously loaned objects for the exhibition, which was realized through the cooperative efforts of many volunteers under the super- vision of Mrs. Vreeland's staff: her assistant, Stephen Jamail; research associate, Katell le Bourhis; and senior administrative assistant, Jeannie D. Lawson. The National Horse Show Foundation presented the Museum with an award of merit to express their appreci- ation for the exhibition. The Costume Institute Visiting Committee, chaired by Geraldine Stutz, held its first meeting on April 10 to acquaint the members of the committee with the staff and activities of the department and to encourage their inter- est. We look forward to a continuing and productive relationship. Our collection has been enriched by a number of outstanding gifts and purchases. A superb habit à la dispo- sition designed by Jean-Baptiste Isabey for the coronation of Napoleon I, intended to be worn as the uniform of a French senator, was presented to the collection by Mary Tavener Holmes. Gregory and Barbara Reynolds gave an outstanding collection of costumes from the 1960s and 1970s, which has suggested directions for our contempo- rary collection. We were delighted to receive a gift that included a number of pieces by Schiaparelli from Miriam Whitney Coletti to augment our earlier twentieth-cen- tury holdings. Our purchases included two exceptional additions to our Regional Traditional Collection, a Japa- nese raincape of black seaweed and a Turkoman robe of 22</page><page sequence="10">Croquet dress. White cotton piqué trimmed with appliqués of black alpaca braid. English, ca. 1865. Purchase, Irene Lewisohn Bequest (1985.23.lab) purple velvet heavily embroidered in gold. A splendid man's French court suit, about 1780, of olive green silk corduroy was one of the important purchases for our eighteenth-century collection. Important advances were made in costume conser- vation with the completion of specific experiments using sound to clean fibers and with continued experimenta- tion using sound to repair fibers. The research resources of the department have been sought by an ever-increas- ing number of scholars, designers, and students from the United States and many foreign countries. Karen Mey- erhoff, assistant for Study Storage, works with more than 30 designers each month, as well as with the 1 14 classes from Parsons, Pratt, and New York University that study the collection in The Costume Institute classroom. Tours of the Study Storage and the exhibition given by our ded- icated tour guides numbered 175. The coordination of all the tours and classes was ably handled by Lillian Dick- ler, senior administrative assistant. With the retirement in May of Gordon Stone, associate Museum librarian, change came to the Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library. The staff and the more than 1800 researchers who use the library each year will surely miss Gordon's helpfulness. Robert Kaufmann is a welcome addition as our new librarian, and we anticipate the library will con- tinue as a major resource for costume studies. The Costume Institute staff has been active profes- sionally. Robert Kaufmann serves as vice-president and chairman of the Nominating Committee of the Metro- politan Chapter, Victorian Society of America, and chair- man of the Wittenborn Commitee for book awards presented by the Art Library Society of North America. He lectured at Columbia University on "Art Librarian- ship" and on "Book Restoration at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence, After the 1966 Flood." Karen Meyerhoff, a fiber artist, has exhibited at the American Crafts Museum and Julie Artisan's Gallery; her work has appeared in Fiber Arts Design Book II and the American Craft Magazine, in addition to other galleries and publications. Katell le Bourhis, research associate, lec- tured on "The History of Man and Shoes" at the Alliance Française and published "Miroir de la Belle Epoque" in FMR (USA). Anne Schirrmeister, assistant curator, joined the department in October. She received graduate degrees from Yale University and continues research for her dissertation, "French Progress and Pride: Fashion and Social Behavior in Impressionist Painting." She lec- tured on "Leisure Clothing in Impressionist Painting" for the United States Institute for Theatre Technology. Judith Jerde, associate conservator, has lectured at the University of Texas, for the Milwaukee Art Museum, for Marymount College in Milwaukee, and has served as a consultant to the Helen Clay Frick Foundation in Pitts- burg. Paul Ettesvold, associate curator, lectured at the Corcoran Gallery, Washington, D. C. in conjunction with the exhibition, The Sun King: Louis XIV and the New World, and on Coco Chanel's Russian Period for the Costume Soci- ety of America Region II symposium in Baltimore. In addition to coordinating and teaching the New York University Costume Studies program, I have lec- tured on the current exhibition for Sunday at the Met and for the Costume Society of America Region II; on the scope of The Costume Institute for The Virginia Museum, Richmond; and on "Art Deco Design in Fash- ion" for the Costume Society of America Region II Balti- more symposium. I have attended the 1984 ICOM costume meeting in Naplion, Greece, and the 1985 meet- ing in Finland. In Finland, I presented two reports, one on Man and the Horse and one on eighteenth-century English floral silks in The Costume Institute collection. This, combined with departmental loans to exhibitions at the Phoenix Art Museum, the Yves Saint Laurent retro- spective in Beijing, China, and research in India for the forthcoming Costume Institute exhibition, has given me the unequalled opportunity to examine costume collec- tions both in the United States and abroad. I continue as Vice-President of the Costume Society of America. Jean L.

This year another study for the same picture became available, and John R. Gaines has with great generosity promised the drawing to us and already given us part interest in the work. This fascinating study, quite different in character from the drawing acquired last year, is reproduced and discussed in Notable Acquisitions 1984-1985, as are two purchases made by the department, drawings by Perino del Vaga and Nicolas Robert. Other gifts should be mentioned: a black and white study for a male portrait by Levrae de Tournières from John M. Brealey, a charcoal Head of a Man from Mrs. Vin- cent Astor, and a Design for a Ceiling by Charles de La Fosse, an anonymous gift. Two drawings by the French sculptor Pierre Puget were purchased, a Design for a Tab- ernacle and A Frigate at Sea. The drawing illustrated here, Neptune and Ceres Pay Homage to Venus by Niccolö Berrettoni, the most gifted of the followers of Carlo Maratti, is a study for the ceiling fresco in the salone of the Villa Falconieri, Frascati. We purchased a drawing by Carlo Maratti himself; it is a pre- paratory study for a painting, St.Rosalia Interceding forVic- tims of the Plague, a commission from the Barberini family for the chapel adjacent to their palace in Palestrina. Three special exhibitions were organized by the department. Many of the French drawings acquired in the course of the last decade were shown in the Robert Wood Johnson, Jr. Recent Acquisitions Gallery. Our exceptionally fine group of drawings by the sculptor Barye, most of them from the H. O.

Mules, assistant curator, organized a beautiful show- ing of Dutch Drawings of the Seventeenth Century in The Metropolitan Museum of Art; she also wrote the text for the spring issue of the Bulletin, which was devoted to this subject. Lawrence Turcic, research associate, spent two months in Europe studying drawings in collections in Germany, France, and Great Britain. Mr. Turcic is pres- ently assisting the curator in the preparation of a collec- tion catalogue, 15th-18th Century French Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This book is scheduled to appear in 1986. We lent drawings to nine institutions in the United States and to exhibitions held in Rome, Cremona, Paris, and Berlin. More than seven hundred visitors came by appointment to the Study Room, and we were able to accommodate a number of small groups of graduate stu- dents for special seminars.

Sperling Fund EGYPTIAN ART The department was pleased this year to have the sup- port of many friends. Noorna Sarofim, Louise Melhado, James and Salle Vaughn, and Jack Josephson, all contrib- uted significantly to our reactivated field program in Egypt and were supported by other members of the Visit- ing Committee. Malcolm Wiener gave a generous contri- bution toward manuscript preparation of one of the Expedition volumes, and William Kelly Simpson offered a gift for a similar project. Norbert Schimmel and Michael Pomerance each lent us two major objects for exhibition; a wonderful Coptic bucket came as an anony- mous loan; Nathaniel Spear gave us a bell shaped as the head of Bes; and Richard Benenson gave a bronze shrew- mouse. We were also fortunate to have the use of The Adelaide Milton deGroot Fund, in memory of the deGroot and Hawley families, to support travel, our excavation, and the salary of our draftsman, and to have long-term loans from Bernard Pomerance and Norbert Schimmel continued. A xerox machine supplied by Mrs. Samuel Reed was in almost constant use. The staff was engaged in various projects. Dieter and Dorothea Arnold directed the work at Lisht for more than four months and followed that by preparing their publication on this site. Peter Dorman and Ray Anita Slater concentrated on their Expedition publications, and I did so on my royal tomb manuscript. In connection with this work, Dr. Slater, Mr. Dorman, and I spent a month in Egypt, Mr. Dorman getting training as well at the University of Chicago's Epigraphic Survey at Luxor. Edna Russmann spent a good deal of time with Museum volunteers this year, supervised a Hagop Kevorkian graduate fellow, taped a recorded tour, served on the Grants Committee, and lectured at the Bos- ton and St. Louis museums. She also arrranged the yearly meeting in New York of the American Research Center in Egypt of which she is a governor. During this time, she still managed to pursue long-term scholarly interests, write book and film reviews, spend a month with the Apis Project at Memphis, and serve as an officer in the Egypto- logical Seminar. Peter Dorman reviewed papers of former Expedition member Lindsley Hall, advised a stu- dent concerning Expedition film footage of the feast of Abu'l Haggag at Luxor, prepared a revision of our gal- lery time-line, and was responsible for the Egyptian sec- tion of a forthcoming multivolume series on the Museum. He addressed the Egyptological Seminar on 26</page><page sequence="14">Bell shaped as the head of Bes. 4th- 1st century b.c. Gift of Nathaniel Spear, Jr. (1985.73) eighteenth-dynasty chronology, completed a review of Christine Meyer's Senenmut, and continued to prepare his dissertation. Both Miss Russmann and Mr. Dorman were responsible, with the technicians, for maintenance and adjustments in the galleries. I planned the installation of the Abydos reliefs and corollary projects and the design of our Special Exhibition gallery. I worked with Objects Conservation on the authenticity of large bronze animals and Egyptian jewelry, reinstalled Coptic and Kharga cases, reviewed lighting, attended an ICOM conference in Paris on museums in Egypt, prepared a note on faience relief chalices, and looked for new acquisitions and supporters. Our research associate Marsha Hill improved vari- ous object files, made a final count of exhibited objects (34,178), and worked with unaccessioned material. She helped scholars and our curatorial staff with information in our archives and prepared the rearrangement of our offices. She assisted me with an article by the late Labib Habachi on our sphinx of Sesostris III. Vivian Peck worked on the records of our deaccessioned objects. Bill Barrette photographed Egyptian collections in four European cities for our archives and gold work in Cairo and Paris for my publications; his paper on climate control and case design was read at the ICOM conserva- tion conference in Copenhagen. William Schenck attended the Third Colloquium on Egyptian Ceramics in Cambridge and supervised two high school interns, Marie-Pier Winters and Katie Marshall. He prepared drawings for publications by Slater, Dorman, and me. New books, periodicals, book repairs, and file work were accommodated by Nita Dawson; Louis Kunsch helped Janet Wright with office work. Objects were sent for short-term exhibitions in Springfield and New York City and long-term display in Memphis. This coming year we will be installing our long- awaited Abydos reliefs and readying our Special Exhibi- tion gallery for its first show. We look forward to this new aspect of our program.

These will already be familiar to our visitors as among the most noteworthy loans exhibited here in recent years. The Coronation of the Virgin, a fine oil sketch by Rubens, was acquired with the Scofield Thayer bequest, and Pellegrini's Bacchus and Ariadne was given by Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Victor Thaw. A partial interest in a splendid Gauguin, Still Life with Sunflowers (L'Espérance), has been given by Joanne Toor Cummings. Paintings by Monet and van Gogh have also been added to the nine- teenth-century collection. A contribution from the Rudolph and Lentilhon G. von Fluegge Foundation, Inc. has made possible the pur- 27</page><page sequence="15">chase of Flora and Zephyr, a canvas by the itinerant eight- eenth-century Venetian painter Jacopo Amigoni. With funds donated by Mr. and Mrs. Wrightsman we have acquired Le Sueur's The Rape ofTamar, which is presently exhibited in the European Paintings galleries, but is des- tined to be permanently installed in the Louis XIV room. In October 1984, van Gogh in Aries opened at the Museum. This exhibition, which was organized by Ronald Pickvance in cooperation with the staff of the department, was designed to explore the paintings and drawings dating from the artist's stay in Aries, February 1888 to May 1889, and it was so successful that a further exhibition, on van Gogh in St. Rémy and Auvers, has been scheduled for the autumn of 1986. We owe a partic- ular debt of gratitude to our colleagues in the Nether- lands - especially the directors and staff of the Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh and the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, Amsterdam, and the Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo - without whose continuing cooperation such exhibitions could not be realized. The Age of Caravaggio followed immediately there- after and was the first of what we hope will be a series of exhibitions sponsored jointly by this Museum and the museums of Italy, under the aegis of the Ministero per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali. The organizers, here and in Naples, were assisted by an international committee of scholars, and the show, more than half of which derived from sources outside of Italy, traveled to Naples, where it opened to the public in May. It was decided that none of Caravaggio's Roman altarpieces could be sent to the United States; nevertheless, the New York public was afforded a unique opportunity to see many masterpieces by this celebrated artist, so few of whose paintings have found their way into American public collections. The exhibition was structured to take account of recent litera- ture and to show Caravaggio's work in the context of a survey of paintings by his contemporaries in Rome. The work of Nicola Spinosa, Soprintendente Reggente at Naples, on the organization of the Italian component of the exhibition, and the participation of Professor Mina Gregori in the preparation of the accompanying cata- logue were essential to the considerable success of the project. The department is occupied at present with prepa- rations for many forthcoming exhibitions. Liechtenstein: The Princely Collections, to open in October 1985, will include over one hundred paintings of the sixteenth, sev- enteenth and eighteenth centuries, among them the eight canvases which constitute Rubens's Decius Mus cycle. An exhibition devoted to François Boucher, which is jointly organized with the Réunion des musées nationaux de France and The Detroit Institute of Arts, will be on view in the winter of 1986. A Degas retrospec- tive, scheduled for the winter of 1 988, will be preceded by showings at the Grand Palais, Paris, and at The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. The Museum's only Stubbs was shown in a retrospec- tive exhibition at the Täte Gallery, London, and the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven; the picture subse- quently traveled to Washington. Two paintings by Degas, The Ballet from Robert Le Diable and Dancers in the Rehearsal Room, with a Double Bass, were included in Degas: The Samson Captured by the Philistines by Guercino (Giovanni Francesco Barbieri).

Gauguin's la Orana Maria was also lent to the exhibition Primitivism and 20th Century Art at The Museum of Modern Art, which traveled to Detroit and Dallas. We were able to make an important contribution to the Renoir retrospective. In the Meadow, Two Washer- women, and Tilla Durieux were exhibited at the Hayward Gallery, London, and the Grand Palais, and, quite excep- tionally, Madame Charpentier and Her Children, which is not usually available for loan, will be shown at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. One reciprocal loan of particular importance was also granted: in exchange for Caravag- gio's Supper at Emmaus, which was sent to the Caravaggio show, View of Toledo by El Greco was lent to the National Gallery, London. In the meantime work goes forward on catalogues of the permanent collections. Walter Liedtke's two-volume catalogue, Flemish Paintings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, was published in 1984. Mr. Liedtke also authored the winter issue of the Museum Bulletin, on Anthony van Dyck, and my Bulletin on Giovanni di Paolo is forthcom- ing. The reinstallation of the galleries for Old Master paintings is nearly complete: only two rooms, galleries 1 1 and 32, remain to be refurbished.

Plans for two new French sev- enteenth-century galleries, funded through the generos- ity of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman, were completed by the department. These will augment the existing Wrightsman galleries, one of them designed to evoke the aspect of a stately bedroom during the reign of Louis XIV (1643-1715), the other to exhibit some of our most splendid examples of furniture, tapestry, sculpture, and decorative arts ofthat period. Thanks again to the gener- ous support of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman and of Mr. and Mrs. John H. Gutfreund, we were also able to start designing four galleries for German and Austrian eighteenth-century art. These will allow us to show furni- ture, porcelains, and silver from the bequest of Lesley and Emma Sheafer, as well as ceramics and glass from the Wilson, Untermyer, and Mühsam collections. Finally, as plans are being made for adding new departmental gal- leries in the new southwest wing, we also have started reassessing our entire holdings, especially those that have been in storage for many years, in order to formulate a comprehensive exhibition plan for the many different aspects of our collections. The year brought us several important gifts. Fore- most among these were: a group of twenty sculptures by Rodin, presented by the B. G. Cantor Art Foundation, that have significantly enriched our collection of works by this master; a French eighteenth-century rock crystal and gilt-bronze chandelier and two small tables signed by the French eighteenth-century cabinetmaker Bernard II Van Risen Burgh, the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman; and many textiles from various donors, most interesting among these being an English eigh- teenth-century carriage cloth from the Bill Blass Collec- tion, and five French nineteenth-century printed cottons from Mildred R. Mottahedeh. In 1984 we were awarded a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and were able to continue with the conservation of our collection of thirty Flemish Ren- aissance stained-glass panels from the Carthusian Mon- astery at Louvain, a project carried out under the supervision of Jessie McNab by an outside conservator, Yourij Donskoj. Two departmental exhibitions were presented in the course of the year: Portugal and Porcelain, a loan exhibition from Portugal, supplemented by ceramics from our own holdings, organized by Jessie McNab in cooperation with the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Lisbon; and Reviv- als and Explorations: Decorative Arts of England and France, 1850-1900, a small exhibition, mostly from our collec- tions, selected by James Draper to illustrate some of the more interesting aspects of this complex period in the history of European decorative arts. A major effort on the part of the department was the preparation of the catalogue of the forthcoming loan exhibition, Liechtenstein: The Princely Collections, for which sixty-nine entries and essays were written by James Dra- per, Clare Le Corbeiller, Johanna Hecht, Clare Vincent, and me. The curators contributed also to the catalogues of other exhibitions: Portugal and Porcelain, with an intro- duction and entries by Jessie McNab, and The Sun King: Louis XIV and the New World, New Orleans, 1984, with entries by Clare Vincent, Clare Le Corbeiller, and Jessie McNab. We are grateful, moreover, to The Joseph H. and Florence A. Roblee Foundation for enabling us to add to our educational activities by publishing the first of a new series of small handbooks designed to focus on spe- cific facets of our collections: Eighteenth-century Italian Por- celain, by Clare Le Corbeiller. As usual, the curators lectured and traveled fre- quently throughout the year. James Parker spoke at The Frick Collection on "Louis-Marie Augustin, duc d'Aumont (1709-1782), Collector of Extraordinary Objects"; and James Draper spoke there on "Bertoldo's Pazzi Conspiracy Medal." Clare Le Corbeiller taught a seminar on Continental porcelain for one of the pro- grams organized by the Department of Public Education, lectured on French eighteenth-century porcelain at the Sèvres Museum in France and on German eighteenth- century porcelain at the Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Vir- ginia, and spent one month as Visiting Scholar at the J. 30</page><page sequence="18">Torso by Auguste Rodin.

The Friends activities began auspiciously with a gala formal dinner in The Astor Court in December. They sponsored two lectures: David Hockney spoke on the influence of Chinese paint- ing on his most recent work, and architect Kevin Roche discussed the stylistic development of the new Japanese galleries. At the first annual spring meeting, the Friends voted to give to the Museum three superb objects: a Swat Valley bronze, a Japanese Buddhist shrine, and a paint- ing album by Ch'en Hung-shou. The Flame and the Lotus: Indian and Southeast Asian Art from The Kronos Collections, the first exhibition of a private collection of this kind to be shown at the Museum, opened in September. Martin Lerner authored the cata- logue on the eighty-five sculptures and paintings dating from around 1500 b.c. to the end of the eighteenth cen- tury from this outstanding collection. The magnificent promised gift of more than two hundred Chinese scrolls, fans, and albums was high- lighted in a three-part exhibition, The John M. Crawford, Jr. Collection of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting. This entire remarkable collection, the most important of its kind in the Western world, occasioned an international sympo- sium in honor of Mr. Crawford: "Words and Images: Chinese Poetry, Calligraphy and Painting" was held in Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium in May. Organized by Wen Fong and Alfreda Murck, the three-day symposium was attended by more than 550 people and featured twenty-three papers by distinguished scholars from the People's Republic of China, Japan, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States. The symposium was made possible by a generous grant from The Dillon Fund. Construction of the Japanese galleries began in Feb- ruary after years of thoughtful cooperation between Wen Fong, Barbara Ford, Yasuko Betchaku, and the architec- tural firm Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates. In Japan, Dr. Ford and Arthur Rosenblatt, vice-president for architecture and planning, arranged for the con- Shinto/ Buddhist plaque with image ofjizo. Japanese. Gilt bronze.

Thanks to a grant from the Mary Livingston Griggs and Mary Griggs Burke Foundation, Dr. Ford is developing educational materials to supplement the exhibition program for use by the Division of Education Services and school and public groups. Alfreda Murck wrote an article on the Crawford col- lection for Orientations magazine. She lectured at the Museum and the Institute for Asian Studies. Suzanne G. Valenstein became a member of the Advisory Council of the Institute for Asian Research at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York and participated in its inaugural seminar. In addition to lecturing on Chinese ceramics, Mrs. Valenstein cata- logued the Chinese ceramics in the Robert Lehman Col- lection. Jean Mailey lectured on Chinese textiles at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, at China Institute in Amer- ica, and for the Needle and Bobbin Club. She attended the board meeting of Centre International d'Etude des Textiles Anciens, of which she is a member of their steer- ing committee for American Friends of CIETA. Maxwell Hearn co-authored with Alfreda Murck et al., The John M. Crawford, Jr. Collection of Chinese Calligraphy and Paint- ing in The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Checklist. He also organized and prepared labels for the exhibition of the Crawford material and in conjunction with that exhibi- tion gave a lecture at the Museum, "Traditionalist or Rev- olutionary, The Statesman-Artist Chao Meng-fu (1254-1322)." Mr Hearn worked on new acquisitions and gallery design for a projected permanent display of ancient Chinese art at the Metropolitan. Barbara Ford gave seminars on the Museum collection of Japanese ceramics for The Institute for Asian Studies. The results of a research trip to Japan in the fall were presented by Dr. Ford in a paper on the Kanto regional school of ink painting at a symposium at the Los Angeles County Museum in March. Yasuko Betchaku lectured on "Japa- nese Festivals and Customs" at the Ukiyo-e Society. In addition to writing The Kronos Collections catalogue, Martin Lerner delivered two lectures on "The Evolution of the Buddha Image in India" for Museum members and traveled in northern India on a research project. Wen Fong Special Consultant for Far Eastern Affairs FAR EAST CONSERVATION Much work has been done this year in preparation for the exhibition of paintings and calligraphy from the Craw- ford collection. Among these, the eleventh-century handscroll Fishing Village at Hsi-sai Mountain was com- pletely remounted. Previously backed with silk, it was in extremely fragile condition. A calligraphic hanging scroll of Hsu Wei with a Japanese mounting was remounted in Chinese style. The Shen Chou hanging scroll Silent Angler was also completely restored and remounted. Various Ukiyo-e style paintings in the Museum's col- lection have in the past been mounted directly on panels. The problems caused by the method of their mounting are common to Western collections. It has been possible to remove many of these from those mounts and restore them to the form of a hanging scroll. The major work of consolidating the pigments on the great Iris Screens by Ogata Korin has been com- pleted. In recent years these works, though glorious in general appearance, were deteriorating rapidly and could not be exhibited or viewed. The delicate condition of the painting of Fujiwara no Kamatari has also been stabilized. This year the Far East Conservation held an interna- tional workshop, "The Making of a Drying Screen," under the auspices of The Starr Foundation which has generously provided an endowment for training pro- grams. There were fourteen participants-primarily from museums, conservation centers, and universities in the United States and England-for the intensive five-day program. A variety of similar programs is being planned with these funds. Sondra M.

Mertens, the curator and administrator, wrote a Bulletin (to appear in the fall of 1985) on choice classical bronzes in the department's collection. The preparation of this publication entailed the physical examination and treatment of many of our bronzes, car- ried out in cooperation with the Department of Objects Conservation, with which she also worked closely in the program of cleaning the Roman wall paintings from Bos- cotrecase that are being readied for reinstallation. The Boscotrecase paintings were taken off exhibition thirty- six years ago when the Roman Court of the department was converted into the Museum Restaurant. Another project on which Miss Mertens worked was the successful completion of the restoration of the Parthenon model. She concluded her term of office on the Grants Commit- tee and continued as a member of the Editorial Board for the Metropolitan Museum journal, in which she published an article. The assistant curator, Dr. Maxwell L. Anderson, was elected chairman of the Curatorial Forum and appointed to the Steering Committee for the Office of Film and Tel- evision. In December he traveled with the deputy direc- tor to Jerusalem to assist in the planning of a projected exhibition of antiquities from the Israel Museum. He worked on the planned reinstallation of the wall paint- Black-figured lekythos. Attic, ca. 560 b.c. Cock between two men. Attributed to the Painter of Louvre E 705 ("Elbows Out").

In the spring he was the lecturer on the Museum cruise along the coast of Italy and Dalmatia and continued to work in the muse- ums of Rome and Naples with special attention paid to Roman wall paintings. He has submitted an article to the Archäologischer Anzeiger and wrote an entry on a marble head of the Emperor Augustus for the second volume of the catalogue raisonné of Mr. David Rockefeller's collection. Among the purchases made during the year should be mentioned a rare Apulian red-figured dinos that most dramatically tells the story of Herakles and the Egyptian King Busiris, as well as an archaic Attic marble diskos for- merly in the collection of Albert Gallatin. We have also been fortunate in securing many fine loans. Norbert Schimmel lent us his splendid cup by the Amasis Painter, a Roman bronze mask of a head of a satyr, a rare Roman bronze vessel with swinging handles, and a group of five Parthian silver vases. Encouraged by the newly installed Roman Gallery, Mr. and Mrs. Leon Levy lent an over life- size portrait of the Empress Julia Domna and a marble grave altar of Publius Annius Eros and his wife. Mrs. J. Seward Johnson allowed us to exhibit two marble busts, one of the Empress Vibia Sabina, the other perhaps of the Princess Vibia Matidia the Younger. The undersigned conducted a seminar on the attri- bution of Attic vases in the fall semester at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. His foreign travels took him to England, France, Switzerland, and Italy. In June he participated at the Beazley Centenary held at London and Oxford. Much of his time was taken up with the preparation of an international loan exhibition, The Ama- sis Painter and His World: Vase Painting in Sixth Century B. C. Athens, shared with the Toledo Museum of Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The exhibition cata- logue written by him was funded by the J. Paul Getty Trust. Elizabeth Milleker was the department's Classical Fellow during the academic year.

Seley Purchase Fund for Islamic Art and Elizabeth S. Ettinghausen Gift, in memory of Richard Ettinghausen (1984.213) The focus of the department has been primarily and with increasing intensity on various aspects of the exhibition Indial opening in September 1985. The exhibition will encompass more than three hundred works of art from Indian, European, Near Eastern, and American collec- tions. The department mounted the third exhibition to be held in The Hagop Kevorkian Special Exhibitions Gal- lery, The Bright Side of Battle: Symbol and Ceremony in Islamic Arms and Armor. The guest curator was David Alexander, research associate of the Arms and Armor Department, and the exhibition was coordinated by Marie Lukens Swietochowski and Carolyn Kane. Designed by Stephen Saitas under the supervision of Jeffrey Daly of the Muse- um's Design Department, it opened on January 17 and will close January 5, 1986. The department is immensely grateful, as always, to The Hagop Kevorkian Fund for making this valued Special Exhibitions Gallery possible and for its continued support of the exhibitions held there. The department is also grateful for the support of the collector in Europe who was an important lender to the exhibition. The special consultant in charge has been immersed in writing the catalogue for the Indial exhibition, a monu- mental task. He has been aided by members of the department and is also immensely grateful to Emily Wal- ter and Laura Hawkins of the Editorial Department for their invaluable assistance and devotion to the cause. Wheeler Thaxton of Harvard, Annemarie Schimmel, and Marie Lukens Swietochowski, all continued their work on the publication of the Kevorkian album of the Emperor Shah Jahan. Marie Lukens Swietochowski traveled to the Soviet Union to study Islamic art in Soviet Azerbaijan (Baku) and Georgia (Tbilisi), contributed the Islamic section in the Report on Projects Funded by the Adelaide Milton de Groot Fund, 1 980-1 983, in memory of the de Groot and Hawley Fam- ilies, lectured in the Museum, and taught a graduate course in Islamic art at Columbia. Marilyn Jenkins lec- tured in a special program in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and in the Kuwait National Museum, Kuwait. Her publications included an article on Mamluk pottery in Muqarnas, vol. 2 (New Haven, 1984), "Architectural Ornament and Decorative Arts," in Treasures of Islam (London, 1985), the catalogue for the exhibition at the Musée Rath, Geneva, and "A Vocabulary of Umayyad Ornament: New Foundations for the Study of Early Qur'än Manuscripts," in Masähif Sana'a (Kuwait, 1985), the catalogue for the exhibition at Dar al-Athar al-Isla- miyyah, Kuwait. She traveled to Turkey under the auspi- 39</page><page sequence="27">ces of the Institute for Nautical Archaeology to study for publication the ceramics and glass found in a medieval Islamic shipwreck and to Kuwait. Carolyn Kane gave a paper at the First International Congress on Turkish Carpets held in Istanbul and visited carpet centers in Anatolia after the Congress. She lectured at the Museum, Yale Art Gallery, and the New York and Princeton Rug societies and contributed to Notable Acquisitions 1984- 1985. Mahrukh Tarapor continued her work as coordinator of the exhibition Indial She made several trips to India to negotiate loans with museums and private lenders. She was assisted by Martha Deese, administrative assistant for Indial, who provided excellent organizational support for all aspects of the exhibition. Annemarie Schimmel published the following works this year: Calligraphy and Islamic Culture (New York Uni- versity Press); Stern und Blume (Star and Flower, an intro- duction to Persian poetical language) (Harrassowitz); Das Mysterium der Zahl (The Mystery of Numbers) (Diederichs); And Muhammad Is His Messenger, the Venera- tion of the Prophet in Muslim Piety (University of North Car- olina Press). She gave lectures at the Institute of Ismaili Studies, London; in the American University, Cairo; the University of Sanaa, Yemen; among others. In the spring she participated in conferences in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as a guest of the government. The department was happy to welcome Susan Salit as administrative assistant. George Berard continued to contribute his versatile talents not only to his regular duties but also in helping to rearrange the galleries on several occasions. Hilda Feiring continued her invaluable services to many aspects of departmental activities. Zdenka Munzer continued her volunteer translating ser- vices, and Karen Peterson volunteered her services for the Indial exhibition. The department is more than ever deeply grateful to Alice Heeramaneck for her generous gift of a Mughal dagger with a nephrite hilt and pommel exquisitely carved in the form of the head of a nilgai (large Indian antelope). A fragment of a rare Turkish small-patterned Vessel Iran, 9th century. Mold-blown glass. Gift of Everett B. Birch (1984.502) "Holbein" carpet of the second half of the sixteenth cen- tury was generously donated by Elizabeth Ettinghausen, in memory of Richard Ettinghausen; Everett B. Birch presented the department with a handsome ninth-cen- tury Iranian mold-blown glass vessel. The department is most appreciative of the generous support of all its donors. Among the exciting purchases were a marblejaft, or pierced screen, a marble basin with carved stylized lotus plants, and a bidri ware hookah base with a decoration of exquisitely wrought flowering plants. All the above are Mughal Indian of the seventeenth century. A further purchase of an enchanting painting of a bird by the renowned seventeenth-century Persian painter Reza-ye 'Abbasi added luster to the collection.

Oil on canvas. Robert Lehman Collection (1975.1.31) In the decade that has passed since its installation in 1975, the Robert Lehman Collection has become an integral part of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the American and international museum community. The permanent collections are organic and well-attended attractions of the Museum and with their wide variety and richness augment those of other departments. In addition, fifteen temporary exhibitions of drawings in our Drawing Galleries in the past ten years provided the visitors with constant enjoyment of these otherwise rarely seen works. Other shows displayed Renaissance furni- ture, maiolica, Venetian glass, and enamels. To share our treasures we organized ten loan exhibi- tions of paintings, drawings, watercolors, and decorative arts. Assemblies of eighteenth-century Italian drawings and of the watercolors of Maurice B. Prendergast trav- eled throughout the country from Ithaca, New York, to Houston, Texas, and from Huntington, New York, to Denver, Colorado. In 1977 the Museum of Western Art in Tokyo displayed more than one hundred objects in Renaissance Decorative Arts from the Robert Lehman Collec- tion; in 1983 the Oklahoma Museum of Art was the bene- ficiary of a whole exhibition that included thirty-six of our best Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Both exhibits were highly lauded firsts. In addition, the Robert Lehman Collection contributed hundreds of indi- vidual loans to various exhibitions in the Museum, in the United States, and all over the world. Further signs of integration were the loans from other parts of the Museum for our exhibitions; the latest in this year gath- ered sixty-one early German drawings ( 1 400- 1 600) from four curatorial departments, the total holdings of the Museum in this field. Since 1 975 the entire contents of the Robert Lehman Collection have been accessioned, provided with inven- tory numbers, and made available on catalogue cards, on location cards, and in photographs and slides. The Departments of Paintings and Drawings Conservation provided not only the necessary work for exhibitions but storage and exhibition mats for several hundred draw- ings as well. The departmental files and the library were doubled to incorporate the results of past and current research on the holdings of the Collection. The educational activity of the Robert Lehman Col- lection was also considerable during the last ten years. It included lectures and demonstrations in connection with our exhibitions, the writing of catalogues, catalogue entries, and labels, and providing information for the 41</page><page sequence="29">Education and Editorial departments. The curator has taught ten graduate courses and seminars as Distin- guished Visiting Professor of the Medieval and Renais- sance Institute of the City College of New York and in this year two courses for the Education Department of the Museum. Futhermore, ten masters' theses were written under his guidance and mentorship on subjects ranging from fifteenth-century Flemish paintings to Medieval and Renaissance decorative arts. Staff members of the Robert Lehman Collection have given close to fifty lec- tures in the last decade at various symposia in other museums and cultural institutions. This year the curator delivered a series on the symbolism of "The Garden, Fountain, and Mirror During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance," and a members lecture in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium entitled "Amor Vincit Omnia: Amo- rous Jewelry of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance". Susan Romanelli lectured on the exhibition of early Ger- man drawings. Our publication activity was just as widespread. Among books by staff members, the Guidebook to the Robert Lehman Collection is now being reprinted, and the curator's book on Masterpieces of Italian Drawing in the Robert Lehman Collection was published in Italian, English, and French and reprinted this year in an American edi- tion. Twelve catalogues, several pamphlets, and a dozen posters for our own exhibitions were also published. Four catalogues were written by the curator to accom- pany the traveling exhibitions. Members of the depart- ment also published articles and reviews in scholarly journals. This year, among others, the curator contrib- uted twenty and Susan Romanelli contributed thirty extensive entries to the catalogue of the Medieval exhibi- tion at the Oklahoma Museum of Art, Songs of Glory, and, in addition, two essays on "Medieval Bronzes" and "Medi- eval Jewelry," respectively. George Szabo Curator MEDIEVAL ART AND THE CLOISTERS Increasing importance was given to two long-planned major exhibitions, both of which I had the privilege to coordinate. The first was The Treasury of San Marco, which opened gloriously in early March. Barbara D. Boehm prepared the didactic labels, and Katharine R. Brown organized the supplementary exhibition, Portrayals of the Basilica of San Marco, drawn from the Museum's own col- lections. I contributed the tape for the Recorded Tour. Katharine Brown and I, together with Margaret E. Frazer, offered public lectures on subjects related to the exhibition. Margaret Frazer planned a special sympo- sium, sponsored by Olivetti, at which she was moderator and I presented a paper. Staff contributions to the Amer- ican edition of the catalogue were shared with our col- leagues at the Louvre. The second major exhibition, Gothic and Renaissance Art in Nuremberg, scheduled for spring 1986, has already occupied much of my time, as well as that of the staff. Staff changes at The Cloisters included the retire- ment of Margaret McNamara, senior housekeeper, and the resignation of Carl Koivuniemi, senior administrative assistant, who left to accept a position with CBS. His posi- tion has been filled by Anne Ward. Stacy Belkind, assis- tant part-time, also resigned; she was replaced by Stephen Campbell. Susan Leach was appointed horticul- turist for The Cloisters and The Astor Court. Tania Bay- ard was promoted to assistant horticulturist full-time. Jeannie E. Freilich, administrative assistant, resigned from the Medieval Department. Anne Fischer was pro- moted to fill her position. Catherine M. Hiller was appointed assistant. Vincent J.Juliano, principal depart- mental technician, retired after thirty-six years and nine months of loyal and excellent service. Martin Fleischer was appointed with the same title. Warren D. Snell, departmental technician, resigned. A major program of glass restoration and installa- tion in the Medieval Department is near completion with the help of Objects Conservation and the Greenland Stu- dio, under the supervision of Charles T. Little, with the assistance of Jane Hayward. Rudolf Meyer, master restorer, part-time, cleaned two recent major sculpture acquisitions. Mme Claude Claire Grenier-Braillard con- tributed funds which made possible the new lighting and explanatory labels in the Romanesque Chapel. The gardens at The Cloisters continued to enrich the experience of our visitors as the result of the imagina- tive efforts of Susan Leach and Tania Bayard. Susan Leach gave several lectures, including one at Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania. Both she and Tania Bayard planned and installed a booth at the New York Flower Show, which received the support of The Garden Com- mittee, headed by Charles D. Webster. Under the supervision of Suse Childs, The Cloisters Library has increased by about two hundred volumes and eight hundred slides. The supplementary series of indi- ces of the Foto Marburg microfiche were purchased with funds from Mrs. Iain Nasatir. The library continues to be an important research tool for not only the staff but also graduate students and faculty of neighboring institutions. Nancy Kueffner, associate Museum educator, directed a variety of programs for the adult public and for special school groups at The Cloisters. Lecturers, curators, horticulturists, guest lecturers, and guest artists enlivened the well-attended series of Saturday Gallery Events. Midweek tours continued unabated. A Summer Youth Program for 3500 students from city day camps and summer schools was made possible by the Louis and Anne Abrons Foundation, Inc., Edwin Gould Founda- tion for Children, the Bella and Israel Unterberg Foun- 42</page><page sequence="30">Circular pendant.

This program utilized the services of twelve specially trained student interns. During the year, a field trip for school groups was planned by The Cloisters in conjunction with the Cathe- dral of St. John the Divine and the heraldry exhibition at The New- York Historical Society. The Cloisters continued its series of Sunday con- certs. Coordinated by Carl Koivuniemi, they featured The Consort of Musicke, Andrea von Ramm, Rolf Smed- vig, The Waverly Consort, and The Empire Brass Quin- tet. Margaret Frazer, Charles Little, and Katharine Brown gave gallery talks in the Medieval Department. Charles Little, together with Professor Elizabeth Parker, contributed the catalogue essays and texts on The Cloisters ivory cross attributed to Bury St. Edmund's, which was lent to an exhibition in Venice and Milan spon- sored by Olivetti. Katharine Brown saw the publication of her booklet on Frankish art in American collections, a book on three Byzantine gold breast chains by the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum in Mainz, and her essay on gems and jewelry in The Dictionary of the Mid- dle Ages. Timothy B. Husband co-edited with Professor Madeline H. Caviness, Corpus Vitrearum, Studies on Medie- val Stained Glass, The United States, Occasional Papers 1, published by the Museum. Mr. Husband contributed reviews to Speculum and The Burlington Magazine; Mr. Little wrote a review for Gesta. Barbara Boehm's article on a fourteenth-century Valerius Maximus manuscript illustration appeared in the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Lisbeth Castelnuovo-Tedesco published the first install- ment of our Italian Romanesque sculpture in Gestas ongoing series, "Romanesque Sculpture in North Ameri- can Collections." Most curators traveled to Europe. Mr. Husband received a Theodore Rousseau Memorial Fellowship for study abroad of silver-stained roundels and related draw- ings in the Netherlands and England. He delivered a paper on glass associated with the Master of the Amster- dam Print Cabinet at a symposium in Amsterdam. Mar- Lapis lazuli pendant plaque. Early Christian, 4th-5th century. Pur- chase, Rogers Fund, Mr. and Mrs. Maxime L. Hermanos and Anony- mous gifts (1984.32) garet Frazer gave a graduate seminar at Columbia University on the Basilica of San Marco. Charles Little gave a graduate course at Princeton University and pre- sented a paper on the Magdeburg ivories at the College Art Association meetings in Los Angeles. I gave two invited papers on Cloisters objects: the English ivory Vir- gin at a symposium on thirteenth-century studies at Harlaxton College in Lincolnshire and on the thirteenth- century saltcellar in a session on "Ornament and Artifact: Possibilities in Cultural Intrepretation" at the College Art Association. I also lectured on late Gothic and Early Ren- aissance art in Nuremburg and on small-scale sculptures in Nuremburg in the Braillard lecture series at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Barbara Boehm was honored by election to the Graduate Student Forum of New York University. I served on an ad hoc committee for faculty appointments at Harvard and was elected a Fellow in the Society of Antiquaries of London. William D.

The staff honored him at a luncheon, and reception and welcomed his successor, Nick Starr. The year's activities centered on preparation for the exhibi- tion Keynotes: Two Centuries of Piano Design, made possible by Reliance Group Holdings, Inc. Master restorer Stew- art Pollens and Andrew W. Mellon Fellow Donatella Degiampietro readied thirty-three instruments for this display, the first of its kind. Ms. Degiampietro's fellow- ship was renewed a second time as she continued impor- tant research on violin varnishes. The opening of Keynotes in late May coincided with the week-long, twenty-fifth anniversary meeting of the Comité International des Musées et Collections d'Instru- ments de Musique, hosted by the department for cura- tors from twelve countries. Musical programs given in conjunction with the conference included recitals by Igor Kipnis and Robert Parkins. Several new recordings of our instruments were prepared during the year, and nine concerts were presented in cooperation with the Society for Asian Music. Assistant curator J. Kenneth Moore organized our musical offerings and supervised two high-school apprentices, Sarah Strasser and Jorge Vargas, who worked on computer projects in cataloguing and bibliog- raphy. Mr. Moore also gave gallery talks for the Educa- tion Department, lectured in the Sunday at the Met series, and reinstalled several cases of East Asian instru- ments. Mr. Pollens visited the Paris Conservatory on a tra- vel grant and created a computer catalogue of our pianos. His articles on early Portuguese pianos and on Bartolomeo Cristofori were published in Early Music and the Journal of the American Musical Instrument Society, respectively. Our volunteer, Constance Old, continued research on dance iconography for a publication. Graduate intern Abby Ripley worked with Mr. Moore on a permanent installation of Central Asian ritual instruments. Senior administrative assistant Susan Snyder coordinated numerous projects, including loans to Gracie Mansion, Lincoln Center, the Museums at Stony Brook, and the Staten Island Children's Museum. I attended meetings of the Sonneck Society, Organ Historical Society, and the American Musical Instrument Society, as well as the Boston Early Music Festival. Arti- cles were contributed to a catalogue of William Sidney Mount's musical works and to a festschrift honoring John Globular flutes. Tairona people, Columbian, 14th- 16th centuries. Ceramic.

At the Museum I lectured on Caravaggio's paintings of musicians and gave a series of five lectures on aspects of the collection. The department offered special tours for students at Juilliard School and hosted a reception for graduate musicology students from local universities. Work con- tinued on my forthcoming book on American instru- ments, funded by Gordon and Ann Getty, and on several recordings and installation projects.

Korwin Robert A. Lehman The most publicly heralded event of our year was the opening of Te Maori: Maori Art from New Zealand Collec- tions in September, in the spacious expanse of The Sack- ler Exhibition Hall. Organized by the American Federation of Arts, in association with the New Zealand government and thirteen New Zealand museums, it was made possible by a generous grant from Mobil. This unprecedented show included 174 objects covering about one thousand years of this Polynesian culture in a variety of materials - bone, jade, ivory, wood - and rang- ing in scale from small ornaments to monumental figure sculptures and major architectural elements. None had been seen outside New Zealand before, and all were included with the consent of the elders of the Maori tribes. The participation of the Maori people was indeed a unique feature, culminating in their enactment of a spectacular traditional ceremony at dawn on the opening day. The exhibition was curated by Professor S. M. Mead, Wellington University; D. R. Simmons, assistant director, Auckland Museum; and me. Professor Mead edited the catalogue, Te Maori: Maori Art from New Zealand Collec- tions. David Harvey made an important contribution with his distinguished installation. The Pacific Islands were also represented by the sim- 45</page><page sequence="33">pie and elegant weavings, ornaments, and other works from Nauru and the Gilbert, Marshall, Ellis, and Caro- line Islands groups shown in Micronesia, which opened in January. Most of the pieces were from the collection made by Mr. and Mrs. Martin Wright, which was pre- sented by the American Friends of the Israel Museum in the previous year. In May The Art of Precolumbian Gold: The Jan Mitchell Collection presented one hundred superlative examples of the famous ancient goldwork from Central and South America, dating from the early centuries of our era until the sixteenth century. This was organized by Julie Jones, curator; she was also editorial coordinator of and contrib- utor to the major publication which accompanies the exhibition. Valuable contributions to this project were made by Heidi King, part-time research assistant. Julie Jones was also responsible for installing Taino Art of the Dominican Republic in June in The Michael C. Rockefeller Wing. Organized by the University Gallery of the Univer- sity of Florida at Gainsville, the exhibition of works in ceramic, stone, shell, bone, and wood illustrated the rich sculptural traditions of the Precolumbian people of the Greater Antilles. Drawn primarily from the Museo del Hombre Dominicano in Santo Domingo, it was the first such exhibition to take place in the United States. Rarity and refinement of quality were the keynotes of this year's acquisitions. A naturalistic figure from Eas- ter Island, presented by Mr. and Mrs. Martin Wright, is an important and unexpected discovery in this field. The collections have also been strengthened by the gifts of an exquisite New Britain dance-staff from Mr. and Mrs. Milton Rosenthal and a group of carved clubs (mainly from Western Polynesia) given by Alan Frumkin. Gifts of African sculpture included a Baule monkey figure of impressive force from Mr. and Mrs. Brian Leyden and a fine Yoruba figure from Dr. and Mrs. Sidney Clyman. An excellent example of an early Maya lidded vessel in the form of a mythical bird was given by Carolyn C. and Dan C. Williams. We have already placed most of these works on exhibition and others will follow in the near future. The department made numerous loans to several exhibitions, particularly Primitivism and 20th Century Art, at The Museum of Modern Art, and to other institutions including the Center for African Art, New York; The Museum of Cultural History, Los Angeles; and the Riet- berg Museum, Zurich. An occasion for sadness was the passing of Nathan Cummings, whose devotion and benevolence toward the Museum was outstanding and frequently expressed. He was a member of our Visiting Committee from its incep- tion, as well as an important donor. An enthusiastic col- lector, he made extensive gifts of Peruvian antiquities during the 1960s, which are a major part of our holdings in the field and prompted the naming of an area of the Rockefeller Wing in his honor. We are happy to welcome two new members to the Visiting Committee: Mr. James J. Ross and Mrs. Linda Lindenbaum. Kate Ezra, assistant curator, conducted research in Mali on Bamana sculpture for a forthcoming exhibition, with the aid of grants from the Theodore Rousseau Memorial Fund and the American Philosophical Society.

Julie Jones also presented a paper at the symposium on "Art as a Means of Communication" at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and lectured at the Metropol- itan. I attended the Wenner-Gren Symposium on "Sepik Research Today" at Basel and lectured at the Metropoli- tan and The St. Louis Museum of Art on Te Maori and at The Museum of Modern Art. Ross Day attended the Art Library Society annual meeting in Los Angeles, and Virginia-Lee Webb spoke at the American Society of Indexers. In August the department was host to the Third Symposium of the Pacific Arts Association, held in the Ruth and Harold D. Uris Center for Education. Made possible by the generosity of Mrs. Evelyn A. J. Hall, this attracted a large international group of scholars, includ- ing many from Europe and the Pacific Islands. The department was also pleased to be host to several meet- ings of the Columbia University Associates in Primitive and Precolumbian Art. In the Robert Goldwater Library, Jane Garry left the staff, as did Lois Kremmins, who was replaced by Hélice Koffler. The library organized a small exhibition of origi- nal drawings in honor of the publication of Tobias Schneebaum's book, Asmat Images, A number of rare publications was presented by Columbia University from the library of the late Professor Douglas Fraser. Our volunteers continue to give invaluable assis- tance: we are delighted to express our gratitude to Diana Becker, Brenda Chalfin, Noam Cohen, Bernard de Grunne, Jane Howland, Dorothy Lytle, Carol Meyer, and Judith Randal. Members of the Conservation Depart- ment, especially Ellen Howe, assistant conservator, and Christine Giuntini, restorer, have devoted much time to the preparation of works for display and continuing care to the collection in general.

Smith. American. Gelatin silver photograph. Gift of Joseph I. Singer (1984.1 162.2) To celebrate the 150th anniversary of James McNeill Whistler's birth, the department mounted two exhibi- tions in the autumn, The Etchings of James McNeill Whistler and The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler: The Gift of Paul F. Walter. Whistler's etchings were the subject of an exhibition organized by guest curator Dr. Katharine Lochnan of the Art Gallery of Ontario, whose compre- hensive book on this material was published by Yale Uni- versity Press. Whistler's lithographs were represented by prints from the collection of Paul F. Walter, who gener- ously donated thirty-two to the Museum, along with his extraordinary collection of Whistleriana. Both exhibi- tions were coordinated by David W. Kiehl. Highlights of our holdings in photography were shown in Photographs from the Museum's Collection, an exhi- bition selected by the curator in charge, including works by pioneer photographers, classic examples of pictorial photography from the Alfred Stieglitz Collection, and recently acquired portrait photographs by Edgar Degas, August Sander, and David Hockney. This exhibition was shown in the winter, concurrently with The Camera and the Photograph: Images in Light, which displayed a substantial group of our photographs in the Ruth and Harold D. Uris Center for Education. In spring we honored a fine gift by showing Picasso Linoleum Cuts: The Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kramer Collection, a selection of the 142 Picasso linocuts donated by Mr. and Mrs. Kramer. The Museum published a catalogue with color illustrations of the collection and a foreward by Wil- liam S. Lieberman and entries by Donald McVinney. In June, the exhibition The Engravings of Giorgio Ghisi marked the publication of a new catalogue raisonné of Ghisi's prints by Suzanne Boorsch, with Michal and R. E. Lewis. The Ghisi exhibition, which included loans from London, Paris, and Rome, opened at The Saint Louis Art Museum in April and will travel in September to the Uni- versity of California, Los Angeles. Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Ross very kindly donated funds to help support the exhi- bition catalogue. Dr. and Mrs. Goodwin M. Breinin made timely gifts of three fine impressions of Ghisi's prints. Among the many splendid donations of prints received this year were two extraordinary bequests. From the Estate of Scofield Thayer, founder and editor of The Dial magazine, we received 202 late nineteenth- and twentieth-century prints by Toulouse-Lautrec, Munch, Redon, Klee, and others. From the estate of Marianne Khuner we acquired 76 Old Master prints, principally by Albrecht Dürer and including engravings by Schongauer and Mantegna. Leonard A. Lauder made a handsome gift of 157 turn-of-the-century American posters which will be the subject of a future exhibition and book pub- lished by this Museum. Continuing their generous support of the depart- ment's acquisitions program, Derald H. and Janet Rut- tenberg provided funds for the purchase of two excellent prints: a rare eighteenth-century etching by Gabriel de Saint-Aubin and a lively portrait of the songstress Cecy Loftus by Toulouse-Lautrec. Anne Stern helped us to acquire four delicately colored Rococo designs for etuis and snuffboxes. From Mr. and Mrs. Paul Gourary we received a rare festival book of 1594 describing the entry into Brussels of Archduke Ernest of Austria. Nelson Blitz, Jr., donated the large monotype self-portrait of Jim Dine that was shown in The Painterly Print exhibition of 1980. Mrs. Richard Riddell contributed a fascinating col- lection of seventeenth- to nineteenth-century Glück- wunschkarten (greeting cards) and designs for almanachs, which are being researched and catalogued by Janet S. Byrne. Gifts of photographs were received from Dr. Joseph I. Singer and from Mr. and Mrs. Robert Massar, 48</page><page sequence="36">who donated George lice's Flowering Tree in memory of Lee Witkin. In memory of A. Hyatt Mayor, curator emer- itus, Mrs. A. Hyatt Mayor presented a gift that allowed us to purchase a portfolio of lithographs by Adolph von Menzel illustrating the education of an artist. We also received welcome gifts of acquisition funds from Richard L. Menschel for the purchase of works by contemporary photographers from David McAlpin, and from the Charles Z. Offin Art Fund, Inc. The department is extremely grateful to these donors and to many others listed on the following pages. Among the responsibilities of the staff is the admin- istration of the Print Study Room, in which the collection is made available to the public daily, by appointment. Sev- eral seminars from local universities and schools met here during the year. Suzanne Boorsch taught a course on the history of fine prints for Columbia University. David Kiehl juried print competitions sponsored by Bos- ton Printmakers and the North Carolina Print and Draw- ing Society; his article on American printmaking in the 1930s was published in Print Quarterly. The curator in charge served on the National Talent Search Jury of Pratt Institute and reviewed two new publications on Degas's prints for Print Collector's Newsletter. Four curators attended the annual meeting of the Print Council of America held this year at The Minneapolis Institute of Arts at the time of the exhibition Regency to Empire: French Printmaking 1715-1814. Mary L. Myers contributed to the exhibition catalogue. Colta Ives Curator in Charge Departmental Accessions Gifts Allan I.

Selection One (opened February) was the first of a series of installations that will survey the twentieth-cen- tury art collection. The forty-six works included featured Gaston Lachaise's monumental bronze sculpture, Stand- ing Woman (1927), and Henri Matisse's Studio Interior (1912), two recent acquisitions that were part of the bequest of Scofield Thayer. Selection Two (opened June) also featured new acquisitions, including twenty-three works by Paul Klee from The Berggruen Klee Collection, several Willem de Koonings from the Collection of Thomas B. Hess, and Anthony Caro's recent sculpture, Odalisque (1983-84), a gift from GFI/Knoll International Foundation. Selection Three, to open in October, will fea- ture an installation from the design and architecture col- lection of the department. Four major loan exhibitions were organized by the department during this past year. New Narrative Paintings, organized by the chairman for the Museo Tamayo in Mexico City, included a selection of recent acquisitions of figurative paintings which demonstrated the various modes of narration employed by contemporary artists. Among the works exhibited were Fernand Botero'sDanc- ing in Colombia (1980), Merengue in Boca Chica (1983) by Rafael Ferrer, and Roger Brown's Modern History: A Civ ics Diatribe (1982). The Figure in 20th Century American Art, organized by Lowery S. Sims, associate curator, is the first of three proposed surveys of our American art collection to be organized in association with the American Federa- tion of Arts. This exhibition of seventy paintings, sculp- tures, and works on paper treating the theme of the figure from 1900 to the present includes such master- pieces as Robert Henri's Masquerade Dress (1911) and Romare Bearden's The Woodshed (1969). This exhibition will tour seven art institutions nationally through June 1986. Ms. Sims also organized The Artist Celebrates New York, an exhibition of thirty-one paintings dating from 1902 to 1984, which record the changing personality of the city during this century as seen in such works as Fair- field Porter's Near Union Square Looking Up Park Avenue (1975), and John Sloan's The Wigwam, Old Tammany (1934). This exhibition, funded by The Altman Founda- tion, will visit community and art organizations in the five 52</page><page sequence="40">Black Columns in a Landscape by Paul Klee. German, 1919. Watercolor on paper. The Berg- gruen Klee Collection boroughs of New York City through December 1985. The department's design and architecture collection was featured in Design 1900-1940, organized by R. Craig Miller, associate curator in The American Wing. The exhibition documented the major design movements of the first half of this century with highlights from the Museum's collection. The exhibition traveled to the Wal- ters Art Gallery, Baltimore, and continued on to the North Carolina State Museum of Art, Raleigh. The department marked the untimely passing of two great friends - the American artist Lee Krasner Pol- lock and Ralph Colin, a founder of the Art Dealer's Asso- ciation - with memorial services that drew together the art community of New York. We also hosted the Chair- man's Council with a presentation on the southwest wing and a behind-the-scenes look at new acquisitions to the department. The department had another extraordinary year for acquisitions. Among the most notable were 342 works in various media that are part of the bequest of Scofield Thayer. Thayer, who owned and edited The Dial maga- zine in the 1920s and 1930s, was intensely involved with European and American modern art. As a result the mas- terpieces in the collection include The Dressing Room (1914) by Pierre Bonnard, The Market Place (1917) by Marc Chagall, and Landscape, Kragero (1912) by Edvard Munch. The Mark Rothko Foundation also announced the gift of 20 works by the American artist Mark Rothko. These works span his career and include a self-portrait of the early 1930s, 4 examples of the artist's surrealistic period (1944-46), 2 of the late gray and brown works on paper, and paintings from the late 1950s and 1960s. The department was given partial interest in 9 works by de Kooning from the Collection of the late Thomas B. Hess ranging in date from 1930 to 1950. We also received Watchman of the Night by the Chilean surrealist artist Matta (Roberto Matta Echaurren) from an anonymous donor; Untitled, a work of 1983 by Agnes Martin from the Ameri- can Art Foundation; an important early work by Milton Avery, Steeplechase of 1929, from Sally M. Avery ; 40 works on paper by Arthur Dove from William C. Dove; 5 sculp- tures by Reuben Nakian from various donors; and 14 cubists drawings by Czech artists from Drs. Hugo and Kveta Polak. The department was particularly fortunate in the number of acquisitions for the design and architecture collection: some 424. The museum accessioned its first objects by a number of major designers, including Robert Venturi, Henry Van de Velde, Gio Ponti, Raymond Loewy, and Florence Knoll. An extraordinary collection of Wiener Werkstatte wallpapers and fabrics, a gift through the exceptional generosity of Mrs. Joanne F. du Pont, greatly augmented our sizeable textile collection. The department has always been fortunate to bene- fit from the generosity of artists, and this year we were pleased to learn that sculptor Louise Nevelson was donat- ing her monumental environmental work, Mrs. N's Palace (1964-77) to the department. One of the best known of her constructed works, it will be an important focus in the installation of the sculpture gallery in the southwest wing. Jim Dine donated six of his drawings, done between 1978 and 1984, which survey some of the most familiar motifs explored in his work. The department made several key purchases, nota- bly two works by Willem de Kooning, Zot (about 1949) and Two Men Standing (about 1938). A portion of the pur- chase price of Zot was a gift of the heirs of Thomas B. Hess. We acquired Chaim Gross's sculpture Young Girl (1926) with a gift from Madeline Mohr; Still Life, February 3, 1984 by the young American painter Donald Sultan, with a gift from Florene M. Schoenborn, and two works by artists associated with American Abstract Artists - Pot 53</page><page sequence="41">Bellied Stove (1936) by Esphyr Slobodkina and Still Life with Wine Glass (1950) by Susie Frelinghuysen - pur- chased with a gift from Clarence Y. Palitz, Jr. I am happy to announce that Dr. Sabine Rewald has joined the staff as assistant curator. Dr. Rewald ably authored the catalogue for Balthus: A Retrospective at the Museum last year and will be doing special research on The Berggruen Klee Collection and the bequest of Scho- field Thayer. Lisa M. Messenger, curatorial assistant, authored a Bulletin on the work of the American artist Georgia O'Keeffe. Associate curator Lowery S. Sims contributed an essay on Wifredo Lam and Roberto Matta for Studies in Dada and Surrealism, published by the Museum of Con- temporary Art in Chicago, and lectured at the Jackson- ville Art Museum in conjunction with The Figure in 20th Century American Art exhibition. The chairman gave three lectures this past year. He lectured on modern sculpture in the Metropolitan's col- lection as part of a sculpture symposium held at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, and he lectured twice on the topic of new narrative painting in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art: at the Anchorage His- torical and Fine Arts Museum in Anchorage, Alaska, in conjunction with jurying the Twentieth Annual All Alaska Juried Art Exhibition; and at the Museum of Art, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
