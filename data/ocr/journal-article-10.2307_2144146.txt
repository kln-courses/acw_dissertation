The fact which confronts us today is that the trials have been held, although in Japan they have not yet been completed. The problem which confronts us today is only very secondarily that of historical judgment; primarily the problem is to find the ways in which the precedent can be turned to its greatest use in promoting the future peace and welfare of mankind. If the foundation on which we are to build is weak, it can be strengthened before a new structure is erected upon it. One way to strengthen the foundation was suggested by Judge Biddle in his report to the President on the Nuremberg Trials, when he urged that the Charter of the Tribunal, which was promulgated with the approval of nineteen United Nations, be now approved for the future by formal act of all fifty-four members of the United Nations. The General Assembly of the United Nations acted upon this suggestion by adopting a resolution prepared by its Legal Com- mittee instructing the Codification Committee to study the subject and report back to the Assembly. But the resolution also contained the following affirmation of the principles con- tained in the Nuremberg Charter: * This article was prepared as a paper read before a meeting of the American Historical Association in New York, December 30, 1946.

Although this affirmation does not have the binding force of a treaty, its political, and probably its legal, force is as great as if it were already embodied in treaty form. Fifty-four states of the world are now on record as approving for the future the principles on which the major war criminals were tried. The General Assembly also adopted a resolution on genocide, a term which has acquired wide currency since it was coined by Dr. Raphael Lemkin and described in his book Axis Rule in Occupied Europe published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1944. Lemkin defined the term as mean- ing " the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group ", a 1 Journal of the United Nations, No. 58, Supp. A-A/P. V./S S, p. 485.</page><page sequence="3">No. 1] AGGRESSION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 3 definition which may not suffice for an international penal code. It is significant that the General Assembly referred the elabor- ation of a convention on this subject to the Economic and Social Council possibly for study by its Commission on Human Rights: the implicit suggestion that the violation of the fundamental rights of man under an International Bill of Rights may also be made an international crime involves rather startling possibilities. The resolution adopted by the General Assembly was as follows: Genocide is a denial of the right of existence of entire huinan groups, as homicide is a denial of the right to live of individual human beings; such denial of the right of existence shocks the conscience of mankind, results in great losses to humanity in the form of cultural and other contributions represented by these human groups, and is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. Many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part. The punishment of the crime of genocide is a matter of inter- national concern. The General Assembly therefore Affirms that genocide is a crime under international law which the civilized world condemns, and for the commission of which principals and accomplices-whether private indi- viduals, public officials or statesmen, and whether the crime is committed on religious, racial, political or any other grounds -are punishable; Invites the Member States to enact necessary legislation for the prevention and punishment of this crime; Recommends that international co-operation be organized between States with a view to facilitating the speedy preven- tion and punishment of the crime of genocide; and, to this end, Requests the Economic and Social Council to undertake the necessary studies, with a view to drawing up a draft con- vention on the crime of genocide to be submitted to the next regular session of the General Assembly.2 2 Journal of the United Nations, loc. cit., p. 476.</page><page sequence="4">4 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXII The two aspects of the precedent afforded by the trial of the war criminals which are most important for the future are, first, the control of war by law and, second, the application of inter- national law to the individual. To appraise the importance of those aspects it is necessary to recall the situation which has existed and which may now be improved. The attempt to develop an international criminal law which will serve as a deterrent to war through the imposition of punishment upon individuals has been discussed often before in academic hall and printed page. It has also been ably argued in international committees. This is the first moment in history when action upon such proposals is not only politically possible but neces- sary. It is " necessary " because the precedent will not stand still. If we do not strengthen it and move it forward, it will slide backward. Inaction by the whole society of nations from now on would constitute a repudiation of the precedent with the consequence that the last state of the world would be worse than the first. It would constitute an assertion that aggressive war is not a crime and that the individual who is guilty of endangering the international public repose is not to be treated as a criminal. What, then, under the traditional law and practice of nations were the deterrents to the use of force? First, in regard to states and their governments viewed as collective entities devoid of individual human personality, there was a somewhat feeble deterrent in the existence of the " law-habit " in international relations. By and large, man is habituated to law in all his relations, and the existence of rules as guides for behavior is a universal convenience. It is a convenience internationally for the strong in dealing with the strong, and for the weak in dealing with the strong; when the strong deal with the weak it is sometimes considered a nuisance. It is not necessary to argue the strengths and weak- nesses of international law in the traditional international sys- tem save to point out that for some three centuries foreign offices have had staffs of legal advisers and have habitually sought to defend their actions on legal grounds.</page><page sequence="5">No. II AGGRESSION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 5 The second deterrent was the fear of counter-action by the state affected, which might resort to retaliation or reprisals or to war itself. The third deterrent was the fear of joint counter-action by a group of states whether they were united in an alliance or more highly organized in the League of Nations. Sanctions and the Stimson nonrecognition doctrine were among the emerging instruments of such joint action in the inter-war period. All these three deterrents were ineffective when the wrong- doer was strong. They were ineffective for at least four reasons: 1. The state was judge in its own cause and the international system had evolved no satisfactory substitute for war; the problem of " peaceful change " was never solved. 2. War itself was not illegal though some lesser uses of force were considered illegal and the manner of waging war was brought under legal regulation. 3. The individual government official, civil or military, was merged in the anthropomorphic fiction of the state and was protected by the concept that it was the state and not the in- dividual who acted. 4. There was no adequate international organization to judge causes and to marshal collective action against a wrongdoer. In regard to an individual contemplating action disruptive of the international public peace, the deterrents were merely the possibility of punitive action by his own state as in the case of counterfeiting foreign currencies, the traffic in narcotics and the slave trade, or action by some other state if he were appre- hended at the foreign scene of his crime or extradited to that place. The defects in these deterrents were the legal limitations on jurisdiction to punish, laxness and corruption in the law admin- istration of some states, and actual connivance or encourage- ment and protection when the act was performed in pursuance of some national policy. Extradition was limited by the prac- tically universal exception of political crimes and by the refusal of many states to extradite their own citizens. International law was considered to be inapplicable to the individual and he could be punished only when he broke some national law.</page><page sequence="6">6 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXII The trial of the war criminals involved the rejection of the theory that the state itself is guilty and can be punished for waging aggressive war. Reparations payments are being con- sidered more like compensatory damages in a civil suit than like fines in a triminal action. Collective punishunent of a group for the offense of a member of the group is by no means un- known to certain legal systems, but the punishment of a whole state and people like Germany and the Germans is both difficult and obnoxious to many people's sense of justice. Whereas the traditional international system put the burden on the state to restrain the individual, the precedent of the trial of the war criminals suggests that pressure in the form of fear of punish- ment should be put upon individuals to restrain the state. It should be anticipated that as international organization-in the form of the evolving United Nations or in the ultimate form of world government-is perfected, collective force will be used to restrain states or other groups of individuals in ad- vance but that punishment after the event will be visited upon individuals and not upon the group. So far as influence upon the fictional collective minds of governments is concerned, deterrents must be sought in the development of the procedures of the international society rather than in the elaboration of new substantive law. This is not to say that international law should ignore the problem of illegal war; much needs to be done to remove the traditional legal theory that belligerents acquire special rights against all the rest of the world by assuming the belligerent status which automatically imposes upon strangers to the struggle the duties of neutrality. It is also absolutely essential to develop law and procedures for peaceful change. Peace will never be secure if we merely put an international lid on a national boiling pot. When there is a strong national feeling of injustice, resentment will eventually produce conflict unless there is some assurance that there is a peaceful substitute for resort to violence. The truth of this proposition is demonstrated by our own experience with labor relations.</page><page sequence="7">No. II AGGRESSION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 7 In the development of international law applicable to the individual and designed to act as a deterrent to acts which will disturb the peace and comfort of the world, both procedural and substantive progress must be achieved. On the substantive side there are numerous experiences on which to build, including notably the conference convened under League of Nations auspices to study the international sup- pression and punishment of terroristic crimes. This effort was the result of the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia in Marseilles in 1934. It led to the drafting of two conventions dealing with such crimes and with the trial of their perpetra- tors before an international criminal court, but the conventions were never brought into force.3 This experience although then fruitless should be utilized along with comparable approaches to the punishment of offenses which have an international inter- est, including piracy, the slave traffic, traffic in narcotics, coun- terfeiting, and traffic in arms and fissionable materials. The first step, after securing formal general approval of the Charter of the Nuremberg court, is to secure agreement, based on the Nurem- berg precedent, that such individual acts should be recognized as international crimes as contemplated in the General As- sembly's resolution on genocide. Thus the list of crimes set forth in the Charter of the Nuremberg Tribunal would be ex- panded. Perhaps in all the examples mentioned it would not be difficult to secure agreement in principle. When one comes to dealing with plotting against the govern- ment of a state, the answer is much more difficult. There are many who would not wish today to enter into an obligation to assist in punishing Spaniards or non-Spaniards who seek to bring about the overthrow of the Franco government in Spain. The subject involves the delicate question of the extent to which the international community can usefully interfere in revolu- tionary strife and civil wars within states. At the present time such interference could not be based on adequate facilities for forming a wise world judgment on the rights and wrongs of 3See League of Nations Doc. 1938. V. 2. and 1938. V. 3., and Manley 0. Hudson, International Tribunals: Past and Future (Washington, 1944), p. 185.</page><page sequence="8">8 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXII such internal conflict, but the ramifications of the subject are too broad to be covered here. The example merely illustrates the point that even the definition of international crimes is by no means a simple task. Progress will be made if one begins with the least contro- versial cases. Among these cases one might, in the light of the trials of the war criminals, include the crime of conspiring to wage aggressive war, but a dilemma appears upon the legal horizon. It is one thing to punish the perpetrators of war after they have waged and lost the war; it is quite another thing to indict them and bring them to trial before war breaks out. If the Soviet government charges Churchill with planning or inciting a war against the Soviet Union, who decides whether the defendant shall be indicted and tried? Is it to be decided by the Security Council and in that case could Great Britain exercise its veto? Who anticipates that we shall soon have an International High Prosecutor with authority to decide such a question? Taking a less controversial or less fantastic case, let us suppose that in twenty years a resurgent Japanese government plans revengeful blitzkrieg with still newer and more terrible weapons. Suppose the secret services of one or more Powers are satisfied that the plot is well advanced. It is certainly clear that one cannot apply the analogy of the policeman who arrests the in- dividual gangster. Although we have agreed that the individ- uals are criminally liable, the preventive steps would have to be taken against Japan as such; and this would require the international solidarity and perfection of international pro- cedures which were so lamentably lacking when Japan attacked China or when Mussolini attacked Ethiopia. There are other procedural difficulties. If there be another incident like those at Sarajevo and Janina, is there to be an international secret police which will at once make an investi- gation on the spot to determine who is guilty? Would such international police officials have authority to arrest suspects and to take them away to the seat of an international criminal court for trial? If the murderers had escaped to the United States and were found here, our laws would need to be changed</page><page sequence="9">No. II AGGRESSION AND INTERNATIONAL LAW 9 to enable a court to deny their application for a writ of habeas corpus. Such difficulties are mentioned, not in despair, but as indic- ative of the fact that the development of an effective system of criminal law administration cannot be achieved overnight. Lawyers will work on drafts and laymen will evince their usual -and frequently proper-irritation over the law's delays. The task needs, however, to be undertaken and to be undertaken promptly. A relatively simple first step might be to imple- ment the already highly successful procedures for the control of the narcotics traffic 4 by the creation of an international tribunal before which offenders could be tried. At the present time, the enforcement of the law is left to the national states and it is the states which are required to enact statutes to make the acts covered by the international treaties criminal and there- fore punishable in their courts. The General Assembly's resolu- tion on genocide follows this pattern. If, following the prec- edent of the war crimes, violations of the convention were agreed to be international crimes and if an international juris- diction were established, a further precedent would be set. Opposition might be expected from those who point with pride to the degree of success achieved in this particular field under the existing system. Such opposition might be met by allow- ing the states a reasonable period of time within which to bring an offender to trial. Upon the expiration of that time, ren- dition to the international court might be mandatory. To sum up: the control of war is the supreme problem which human society must solve. Law is needed here, as in other human activities, for the definition and punishment of illegal conduct. But law alone is not enough. It will not operate in a sovereign vacuum. The causes of international conflict must also be met at the source. On the legal side two great advances have been registered by the trial of war criminals and the re- affirmation of the principles on which they were tried. First, 4 See Bertil A. Renborg, International Drug Control, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Experience in International Administration, Preliminary Materials and Monographs, No. 3 (1943).</page><page sequence="10">10 POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY [VOL. LXII the states of the world have relinquished their historic freedom to wage war for the vindication of what they unilaterally assert are their rights. It must not be forgotten that the restrictions on the use of force which the Charter of the United Nations imposes constitute an important milestone in this general prog- ress despite the procedural defects of the United Nations system. Second, international law has been brought home to the in- dividual. The individual can no longer hide behind the legal screens of sovereignty, acts of state, and superior command. Whether or not one has agreed with the bases of the trials of the major war criminals, the obligation of jurists, of his- torians, and of all scholars and citizens is to look forward, not back. Bulwer declared it to be " Earth's law: the conquered are the wrong." The future law must be: " The wrong shall be conquered." PHILIP C. JESSUP</page></plain_text>
