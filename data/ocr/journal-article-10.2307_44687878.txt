Copyright Â© 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT There is a paucity of data regarding the potential for pediatric cervical spine injury as a result of acceleration of the head with no direct impact during automotive crashes. Sled tests were conducted using a 3-year-old anthropomorphic test device (ATD) to investigate the effect of restraint type and crash severity on the risk of pediatric inertial neck injury. At higher crash severities, the ATD restrained by only the vehicle three-point restraints sustained higher peak neck tension, peak neck extension and flexion moments, neck injury criterion (Nij) values, peak head accelerations, and HIC values compared to using a forward-facing child restraint system (CRS). The injury assessment reference values (lARVs) for peak tension and Nij were exceeded in all 48 and 64 kph delta-V tests using any restraint type. The test at a delta-V of 64 kph using only the vehicle belts as restraints resulted in peak upper neck tension, peak upper neck extension moment, and Nij values two times greater than the corresponding IARV. Only small differences were found in the injury metrics between a CRS installed with and without webbing tension except that head excursion was greater in the installation without webbing tension. These data show that the potential for neck injury exists for children involved in severe frontal crashes and restrained in either a forward- facing CRS or by vehicle belts-only, even in the absence of head contact. INTRODUCTION According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death in children ages 3 to 14 years old (NHTSA 2004). Child restraint systems (CRS) have been found to reduce fatal and serious injures (Arbogast et al. 2004; NHTSA 2004; Elliott et al. 2006). However, in 2004, approximately half of the fatally injured children ages 1 to 4 years old were using a child safety system at the time of the crash. These data demonstrate that while current child restraint systems are effective in reducing fatal and serious injuries, a substantial number of fatalities occur to children restrained in child seats in motor vehicle crashes. Currently the guidelines regarding child restraint usage from the American Academy of Pediatrics and NHTSA specify that a child ages from 1 to about 4 years old and weighing 20 to 40 pounds should be placed in a forward- facing CRS in the rear seat when riding in a motor vehicle. A child up to 80 pounds or more, between ages 4 and 8 years old, and shorter than 4 feet 9 inches tall should be seated in a belt-positioning booster in the rear seat of the vehicle. The majority of children involved in motor vehicle crashes are restrained by some means (Arbogast et al. 2004; Durbin et al. 2005). However, child restraint misuse and inappropriately restrained children have been reported at a significant rate (Bull et al. 1988; Hummel et al. 1997; Arbogast et al. 2004; Winston et al. 2004; Durbin et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2006). Improperly restrained children have been shown to have a significant increase in the severity of injuries (Brown et al. 2006). While proper use of a child restraint has resulted in a significant reduction of the risk of head injuries, the risk of spinal injuries was not significantly reduced (Valent et al. 2002). Although cervical spine injuries are uncommon in the pediatric population, the mortality rate from these injuries is high (Givens et al. 1996; Patel et al. 2001). Motor vehicle crashes are a common cause of cervical spine injuries in young children (Givens et al. 1996; Zuckerbraun et al. 2004). Investigations using field accident data have found that the change of velocity (delta-V) of the vehicle during a crash is a strong predictor of injury risk for children (Brown 2006). Currently the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for child restraint systems (FMVSS 213) does not explicitly incorporate any neck injury criteria. The standard currently requires child restraint systems (CRS) to be tested using peak sled accelerations of 19-25 g and a pulse duration of 75-90 ms. These requirements include only injury criteria for the head and chest. In 2002 NHTSA published a notice of proposed rule making (NPRM) that suggested amending FMVSS 213 to specify using the Hybrid III and CRABI ATDs with neck load cells and specifying a neck injury criteriion (Van Arsdell 2005). The injury criteria proposed was the Nij criterion specified in FMVSS 208 without the peak tension and compression limits. The comments in response to this proposal mostly opposed the new neck 1126</page><page sequence="2">injury criterion. The respondents expressed concerns regarding increased cost and unintended consequences of instituting multiple, unevaluated changes to the standard, while the use of current CRS designs have resulted in extremely low injury rates despite extensive misuse. NHTSA conducted testing that showed many of the CRS currently on the market failed to meet this neck injury criterion, and no neck injury criterion was incorporated into the final rule. NHTSA suggested that the HIC36 requirement will "serve as a surrogate of sorts for a neck injury criterion." (Van Arsdell 2005) While neck injuries are uncommon in restrained pediatric occupants, case studies have been reported in the literature detailing restrained children who have sustained cervical spine and spinal cord trauma in frontal crashes without evidence of head contact (Fuchs et al. 1989; Huelke et al. 1992; Newman and Dalmotas 1993; Trosseille and Tarriere 1993; Weber et al. 1993; Stalnaker 1993). Many of these cases involved young children (&lt; 6-years-old) involved in severe or moderate severity frontal crashes (delta-V &gt; 45kph) and restrained in various configurations including lap belt only, lap-and- shoulder belts, and a variety of CRS systems. The injuries consisted of fractures, dislocations, and/or spinal cord damage in the high cervical spine. The postulated mechanism for these types of injuries is inertially- induced loading of the cervical spine during these crashes (Huelke et al. 1992; Newman and Dalmotas 1993). Additionally, the authors have personally investigated a number of other frontal collisions in which children restrained in a variety of configurations (including vehicle restraints only, forward-facing CRS, and booster seats) have sustained cervical spine injuries without any evidence of head contact. The anatomy and anthropometry of the young pediatric population make them particularly vulnerable to inertia! neck injuries. As observed in a number of previous studies, children are not miniature adults. Young children have a relatively large head and smaller neck (Burdi et al. 1969; Huelke 1998). Also, the pediatric spinal ligaments are more lax and the neck musculature is less developed, allowing for increased motion of the cervical spine (Fuchs et al. 1989). The vertebral bodies are not fully ossified and the facet joints are more horizontal than in adult spines (Fuchs et al. 1989). All of these anatomical characteristics of children make them more susceptible to inertial neck injuries in frontal collisions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the biomechanical response of children during frontal crashes without head contact. One aim of these tests is to systematically examine the effect of crash severity on the potential for pediatric inertial neck injuries. Also, this study examines the injury risk to a child properly restrained (forward-facing CRS installed properly), misusing a restraint (forward-facing CRS installed without recommended vehicle webbing tension), and using an age-inappropriate restraint configuration (three- point vehicle belts only). METHODS To investigate the potential for inertial neck injuries, sled tests were conducted using anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) in different restraint configurations at different crash severities. Tests were conducted using a pneumatic acceleration system, a programmable wire- bending decelerator, and a 170-ft rail that minimizes test article disturbance during the acceleration phase (Seattle Safety LLC). Tests were conducted at 32, 48, and 64 kilometer per hour (kph) change of velocity for each restraint configuration. A 1996-2004 model Chrysler minivan second row bench seat was rigidly secured to the sled. The bench seat and buckle stalks were replaced with the same type of seat after each severe (64 kph) test. The vehicle seatbelt restraint system and corresponding hardpoints used in each tests were from the Chrysler minivan. The seatbelts consisted of a three-point continuous loop system with a vehicle-sensitive and webbing sensitive, emergency-locking retractor. The system did not include an automatic-locking feature. The entire restraint system (belt, retractor, anchors), with the exception of the buckle stalk, was replaced by an unused system prior to each test. ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICES AND RESTRAINT CONFIGURATIONS A 3-year-old Hybrid III ATD was placed on the right outboard position of the bench seat. The ATD was secured in three different restraint configurations at the three different impact severities. For the first configuration, the ATD was placed in a properly installed forward-facing CRS. A new model CRS [Titan, Model# 3671595P1 Evenflo Company, Inc.] was used for each test in this series. The model of CRS used during these tests weighed 10.4 pounds and was chosen based on its high rating by Consumer Reports (May 2003). In the first configuration, the CRS was installed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The installer applied his body weight to the seat and then tightened the vehicle restraints so that there was tension in the webbing. Because the vehicle restraint system did not include an automatic-locking feature, the vehicle belts were routed through the CRS and secured using the manufacturer supplied locking clip according to the instruction manual. Tethers were not used in any of the sled tests conducted as part of this study. To investigate a common misuse of a CRS, the second configuration used the same model forward-facing CRS installed according to the manufacturer's instructions, except without applying tension to the webbing. The vehicle belts were positioned such that the webbing had a minimal amount of tension while not allowing any slack to occur between the belt and CRS Again, the CRS was replaced by a new unused CRS at the beginning of each test. For each CRS configuration, the location of the latchplate and locking clip was measured relative to the vehicle restraint anchor position. Similarly, the location of the CRS belts and chest clip were measured relative to the 1127</page><page sequence="3">CRS. These locations were the same for each test to ensure the repeatability of the CRS and ATD installation between tests. The third configuration examined an inappropriate restraint configuration for a 3-year-old with the ATD placed on the bench seat without the CRS and restrained only by the vehicle restraints. In each of the same tests, a six-year-old Hybrid III ATD was placed on the left outboard position in 3 different restraint configurations. The ATD was placed in a booster seat [TurboBooster, Model# 8498SRT Graco Children's Products Inc.] and restrained with the vehicle belt system for the first configuration. The booster seat was replaced with a new seat before each test. This model booster seat was chosen based on its high rating by Consumer Reports (May 2003). For the second configuration, the ATD was placed on the bench seat and restrained by the vehicle belts with the shoulder belt placed behind the torso of the ATD. The third configuration consisted of the ATD seated on the bench seat restrained by the vehicle belts with the shoulder belt placed across the torso. The vehicle restraints were replaced with an unused restraint prior to each test. The results from the 6-year-old ATD are beyond the scope of this communication and will be presented in a subsequent paper. INSTRUMENTATION The impact velocity of the sled was measured using a velocity trap and the sled acceleration was measured using sled-mounted accelerometers. Shoulder and lap belt loads were measured during each test. High-speed video was recorded using an on-board digital camera on the right and an off-board digital camera on the left side. Target markers were placed on the rigid sled frame, on the CRS (when used), and at the approximate center of gravity of the ATD head as viewed from the side. Head acceleration was measured with three uniaxial accelerometers mounted at the head center of gravity. Six axis load cells measured neck loads, one at the upper neck and the other at the lower neck location. Chest acceleration was measured using three uniaxial accelerometers and chest deflection was measured using a potentiometer. DATA ANALYSIS Each channel of data was recorded at 10,000 samples per second and filtered according to crash test standards [SAE J211]. The high-speed digital video was recorded at 500 frames per second. The head acceleration data and neck load data were only analyzed for the inertial pulse prior to contact with any structure, including contact between the head and other parts of the ATD. Peak resultant acceleration, HICi5, and HIC36 were calculated from the head acceleration data acquired. Head excursion from the initial seated position was measured from the high- speed video using Image Express (Sensors Applications Inc., Utica, NY). Tensile load, peak neck moment and neck injury criterion (Nij) were calculated using the data obtained from the upper neck load cell. The Nij was calculated according to the FMVSS 208 specification for the 3-year-old ATD. RESULTS The results for each of the nine tests conducted are reported in the appendix in Table A1 and discussed below. CRASH SEVERITY The measured delta-V of each sled test was within 1 kph of the target crash severity. The average peak sled accelerations for the 32, 48, and 64 kph tests were - 16.6, -25.2, and -33.6 g respectively. The pulse durations of each test were similar with the average pulse time of 96 ms. The shape of the acceleration-time history was approximately a haversine shape (Figure 1). Figure 1: Typical sled accelerations. Tightly installed CRS tests at 3 different severities. UPPER NECK LOADS The peak axial loads measured in the upper neck were tensile forces for all tests (Figure 2). Increased crash severity generally resulted in increased peak upper neck tension for each restraint configuration. The 48 kph tests produced peak tension values greater than the 32 kph tests for each type of restraint. The peak tension values for the 48 kph and 64 kph tests were comparable for a tightly installed CRS. In contrast, the tension measured during the 64 kph belts-only test was 35% greater than the 48 kph test using the same restraint configuration. 1128</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2: Peak upper neck tension Upper neck peak tension varied between the different restraint configurations tested (Figure 2). The belts-only 32 kph test resulted in decreased upper neck tensile load compared to the tight and loose CRS installations. In contrast, the upper neck tension in the 64 kph belts- only test was greater than the CRS configurations. The CRS installation without webbing tension produced upper neck tensile forces slightly lower than the tight installation at 32 and 48 kph. Tensile loads were comparable for both CRS tests at 64 kph. The peak upper neck moments measured in the 3-year- old ATD were all extension moments. The peak extension moments increased with increasing crash severity for the belts-only restraint configuration (Figure 3) and were comparable for all crash severities in both CRS configurations. The peak neck moments were similar across delta-V for both CRS tests. For the 48 and 64 kph tests, the peak moment was more than double the value recorded during the CRS tests. Figure 3: Peak upper neck extension moments The peak flexion moments in the upper neck were greater in the belts-only tests when compared to the CRS tests at the same crash severity (Figure 4). The flexion moment during the belts-only, 32 kph tests was greater than that in any accident severity in both CRS restraint configurations. Figure 4: Peak upper neck flexion moments UPPER NECK INJURY ASSESSMENT REFERENCE VALUES Peak tensile load One of the neck injury assessment reference values specified in FMVSS 208 for the 3-year-old dummy is a peak tensile upper neck load of 1130N. Eight out of the nine tests conducted in this study resulted in peak upper neck loads greater than this reference value (Figure 2). Only the belts-only 32 kph test resulted in peak upper neck tension less than this criterion (1084N). Neck Injury criterion - Nii The injury criteria Nij was calculated for each sled test using the methods and critical values specified for the 3- year-old ATD in the federal motor vehicle safety standards. The maximum value of Nij for each test was in tension and extension (Nte). The maximum Nij values during the 32 kph tests for the CRS and belts-only configurations were approximately 1 (Figure 5). The 32 kph, belts-only test was the only test to be below the Nij criterion. 1129</page><page sequence="5">Figure 5: Neck injury criterion -Nij The peak Nij value increased slightly with increased crash severity for both CRS configurations For both configurations, the Nij increased from approximately 1.1 in the 32 kph CRS tests to 1.35 in the 64 kph tests (Figure 5). Also, the relative contribution of the upper neck tension increased slightly with increased delta-V in the CRS tests. The tension component of peak Nij was approximately 60% for both 32 kph CRS tests and increased to 75% when the delta-V was increased to 64 kph. There was a more dramatic increase in the peak Nij with increased delta-V for the belts-only configuration (Figure 5). The peak Nij more than doubled between the 32 and 64 kph belts-only tests. The tension component of the peak Nij was approximately 50% for the 32 kph and 48 kph belts-only tests. The contribution of tension decreased to 28% of the peak Nij during the 64 kph belts-only test. The peak Nij values for all restraint configurations were similar at the 32 and 48 kph crash severities. The peak Nij values ranged between 0.8 and 1 .0 for each of the restraints used at 32 kph. The 48 kph tests produced a peak Nij of between 1.1 and 1.45 for each restraint configuration. Both CRS tests at 64 kph also showed similar peak Nij values (1.35). The peak Nij value for the belts-only 64 kph test was greater than the CRS tests at the same crash severity. This test resulted in a peak Nij of 2.0, exceeding both the tension and extension component of the Nij criterion at the same point in time. The belts-only tests showed a lower contribution of tension to the peak Nij value at each crash severity compared to the CRS tests. The most dramatic difference was during the 64 kph tests where the neck tension comprised approximately 75% of the peak Nij for the CRS tests and only 28% for the belts-only configuration. The CRS configurations at each crash severity had minimal flexion moments of the upper neck (Figure 4). The tension-flexion neck injury criterion from each of these tests was below 0.35. LOWER NECK LOADS The peak tension in the lower neck load cell increased with increased crash severity for each restraint configuration (Figure 6). All configurations at 48 kph were greater than all configurations at 32 kph. Similarly, all tests at 64 kph were greater than all configurations at 48 kph. Within each restraint configuration the peak tension more than doubled between the 32 kph and 48 kph tests. The 64 kph peak tension increased 55%, 29%, and 47% over the 48 kph sled test within the CRS tests with and without webbing tension and belts-only configurations respectively. Figure 6: Peak lower neck tension At each crash severity, the peak lower neck tension varied between the different restraint configurations. At each severity, the peak tension for the belts-only configuration of the 3-year-old was greater than both the CRS configurations. The lower neck tension in the belts- only configuration increased between 30% and 50% over the CRS configurations for the three crash severities tested. The two CRS configurations resulted in similar lower neck loads at each crash severity. LOWER NECK MOMENTS During all sled tests conducted, the peak moments in the lower neck were flexion moments and the extension moments were minimal. For the belts-only tests, the peak lower neck moment increased with increased crash severity (Figure 7). In contrast, the peak moments were similar in both CRS configurations across all crash severities, with slightly lower values in the CRS installed without webbing tension. 1130</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7: Peak lower neck flexion moments The peak moments measured during the 32 kph CRS tests were greater than the belts-only test. However, the 64 kph tests resulted in greater peak moments in the belts-only configuration when compared to the two CRS installations. The moments in the 48 kph tests were similar across restraint configurations. HEAD ACCELERATIONS Noise spikes were observed in the longitudinal head acceleration (Ax) data in the CRS tests with webbing tension and the 32 kph and 48 kph belts-only test. This accelerometer then failed after the crash pulse during the 48 kph belts-only test and had to be replaced. These noise spikes were confirmed after reviewing the video, which demonstrated that no impact to the head corresponded to these short duration spikes. These spikes were disregarded during the peak acceleration and HIC analyses. HIC values varied less than 3% between the data with and without the noise spike. For the belts-only tests, the high-speed video revealed that the ATD head contacted the upper and/or lower extremity during its forward movements. This was confirmed with the head acceleration data that showed a short duration pulse corresponding to the head contact. This contact occurred after the peak inertia) head acceleration pulse. These head impact pulses were not observed in the head acceleration data traces for the CRS tests. The purpose of this study was to examine the response of the ATD during the inertial pulse without any head contact. Therefore, the HIC values for the belts-only tests were computed only up until the occurrence of head impact with the extremities. Peak resultant linear acceleration of the head increased with increased crash severity for each restraint configuration (Figure 8). Within the same restraint configuration, the peak accelerations approximately doubled between the 32 kph to the 64 kph tests. The peak head acceleration measured during the belts-only configuration was higher than the CRS tests for each crash severity. The test using belts-only resulted in 30% to 50% greater head accelerations than both CRS configurations. Figure 8: Peak resultant head accelerations (prior to head contact with the lower extremities in the belts-only configuration) HEAD EXCURSIONS The peak horizontal excursion of the ATD head differed between the restraint configurations (Figure 9). The CRS tests without webbing tension resulted in increased head excursion over the CRS tests with webbing tension and belts-only tests at the same crash severity. The belts- only tests had smaller excursion than the CRS tests at each crash severity. For all restraint configurations, the excursion of the head increased with increased delta-V. Figure 9: Peak horizontal head excursion from pre- impact seated position 1131</page><page sequence="7">HEAD INJURY ASSESSMENT REFERENCE VALUE The federal safety standards (FMVSS 208) and other researches have defined the head Injury criterion as a HIC15 value of 570 for the 3-year-old ATD (FMVSS 208, Mertz et al, 2003). The HICi5 measurements were below this reference value for all 32 kph tests (Figure 10). Also, the 48 kph tests using the tight and loose CRS restraints resulted in HICi5 values below this value. However the 48 kph, belts-only test resulted in a HIC15 value greater than the reference value of 570. All restraints at 64 kph exceeded the reference value. The 64 kph, belts-only test resulted in a HIC15 value more than three times greater than the injury reference value. Figure 10: Head Injury Criteria HIC15 (accelerations evaluated prior to head contact in the belts-only configuration) The federal safety standard 213 defines the reference value for head injury (HIC36) to be a value of 1000 for all ATDs tested in child restraint systems. Examining the HIC36 values revealed that the 32 and 48 kph tests resulted in HIC36 values below this reference value. The increased crash severity of 64 kph resulted in HIC36 values greater than 1000 for all three restraint configurations tested. During the 64 kph belts-only test, the HIC36 value was more than twice this injury reference value. Figure 11: Head Injury Criteria HIC36 (accelerations evaluated prior to head contact in the belts-only configuration) The head injury criteria HIC15 and HIC36 increased with increased crash severity (Figures 10,11). Within the same restraint configuration, the HICi5 values for the 48 kph tests were more than three times greater than the 32 kph tests. The CRS configurations produced an increase of approximately 50% between the 48 and 64 kph tests. The belts-only tests showed an increase of almost 150% between these two severities. Similar increases in HIC36 were noted with increasing crash severity. The belts-only configuration resulted in a greater HIC15 value than the CRS configurations for each crash severity (Figure 10). As the delta-V increased this difference increased. The HIC15 values during the 32 kph tests are similar for all restraints. At 48 kph, the belts- only test resulted in a value more than 50% greater than the HIC15 determined for CRS configurations at the same delta-V. The belts-only test at 48 kph produced a HIC15 value comparable to the CRS tests performed at an increased delta-V of 64 kph. The HIC15 value for the belts-only test at 64 kph was more than double the value calculated for the CRS tests at the same severity. A similar increase in the 64 kph belts only configuration was also observed in the HIC36 data (Figure 11). CHEST ACCELERATION The 3 ms clip peak chest resultant acceleration increased with increasing delta-V for each restraint configuration (Figure 12). The peak acceleration increased approximately 60% between the 32 and 48 kph tests for each restraint configuration. The CRS tests produced only an approximate 1 5% increase from 48 to 64 kph. However, the belts-only configuration produced an increase of 45% between the same severities. 1132</page><page sequence="8">Figure 12: Resultant chest accelerations (3 ms clip) During the 32 and 48 kph tests, the belts-only test resulted in slightly lower chest accelerations than both CRS configurations. The peak acceleration during the 64 kph tests were similar between the restraint configurations. The peak accelerations measured during the 48 kph were greater than all tests conducted at 32 kph. Similarly, the 64 kph tests for all restraint configurations resulted in accelerations greater than all the 48 kph tests. CHEST DEFLECTION As the crash severity increased, the peak chest deflections also increased within each restraint configuration (Figure 13). The peak chest deflections were similar for the two CRS restraint configurations at each crash severity. The belts-only configuration resulted in more chest deflection than the CRS restraints at each delta-V. Figure 13: Peak chest deflections CHEST INJURY ASSESSMENT REFERENCE VALUE The federal safety standards define the injury reference value for chest injury to be an acceleration (3 ms clip) of 55 g for the 3-year-old ATD. This value was exceeded during the 64 kph tests for all restraint configurations. The peak chest acceleration during the 48 kph test using the CRS installed without webbing tension was also greater than the reference value. Mertz et al (2003) defined the reference value for peak chest deflection as 28mm for the 3-year-old ATD loaded by a shoulder belt. This value was only exceeded during the 64 kph test with the belts-only restraint configuration. DISCUSSION The purpose of this study was to examine the inertial neck loads produced in a 3-year-old ATD during frontal crashes at different severities and using various restraint configurations. Peak upper and lower neck tension, peak upper neck extension moments, peak upper neck flexion moments, and Nij values were higher for the ATD restrained by only the vehicle belts compared to using a forward-facing CRS. This demonstrates that of the configurations tested, the 3-year-old restrained in the vehicle seatbelts without a CRS has the highest risk of neck injuries caused by inertial (non-contact) conditions. Lower neck loads were less than upper neck loads, consistent with anecdotal field accident data showing more upper neck injuries (Fuchs et al. 1989). Only small differences were found in the ATD response between a CRS installed with and without webbing tension, except for head excursion. During the tests of the improper CRS installation, the CRS was not coupled to the vehicle seat during the initial phase of the crash pulse due to the lack of tension in the vehicle belts. Therefore during this initial phase of the deceleration, the CRS moved relative to the seat and basically increased the effective mass of the ATD (ATD 35 lbs, CRS 1 1 lbs). However, this effect was minimal resulting in only small differences in the injury metrics. For the 3- year-old, this study demonstrates that a properly installed forward-facing CRS restraint configuration minimized the potential for head and neck injury. However, in every test at 48 and 64 kph delta-V, irrespective of restraint type, the injury reference values for peak upper neck tension and Nij were exceeded. This demonstrates that the potential for inertial neck injuries exists during severe frontal crashes even for properly restrained children. The CRS installed without webbing tension resulted in larger head excursions than the CRS with webbing tension. The difference between head excursions in the two configurations was approximately five to ten centimeters. The addition of a top tether would likely reduce head excursions in the CRS configurations. Additionally, research using ATD and cadaver data has shown increased head excursions in the cadaver test compared to a test conducted using the same crash 1133</page><page sequence="9">parameters and a 3-year-old ATD (Wisman et al. 1979). Any increase in total head excursion will increase the risk of head contact with forward structures. In the absence of contact, injuries are not caused by excursion. Injuries are the result of relative motion between the child's head and torso as the torso is decelerated by its interaction with the restraint system. This is shown in the fact that the CRS installed without webbing tension resulted in increased head excursions but comparable head and neck loads to the CRS installed with webbing tension. Because of their anthropometry with the head mass being a larger portion of the total body mass and their relatively less developed neck anatomy, children will by their nature be more susceptible to inertial neck injury. Any attempt to use technologies such as force-limiters to decrease the ride- down accelerations of the torso will necessarily increase the excursion of the child occupant, increasing the risk of impacting interior vehicle structures. Increased head accelerations in the belts only configuration were associated with increased neck loads in that configuration, compared to both CRS configurations (Figure 8). Chest accelerations were comparable for all three configurations (Figure 12), suggesting that all configurations provided similar restraint at the mid-torso, where the accelerometer is located. However, differences in upper torso restraint due to geometrical differences between the CRS (both shoulders restrained) and vehicle belt restraint (one shoulder restrained) configurations affect the upper torso kinematics, as well as the motion of the head and neck. The decreased neck loads measured in CRS tests could also be a result of the added compliance of the CRS structure and CRS belts. This increased compliance allows for decreased ride-down accelerations and increased excursion of the ATD when restrained in a CRS (Figure 9). Other researchers have also performed sled testing using the 3-year-old ATD. To our knowledge, no other testing has been performed at speeds as high as the 64 kph delta-V done in this series, nor has there been a study evaluating the effect of vehicle restraint webbing tension using instrumented ATDs. Henderson et al. (1997) performed 48 kph sled tests with a 3-year-old ATD restrained in three-point restraints. They reported neck tensile forces and HIC values comparable to those reported in this study; however, they measured upper neck flexion moments several times larger than those reported in the current study. Kapoor et al. (2006) performed a sled test at 48 kph using a 3-year-old ATD restrained in a forward-facing CRS and reported lower values of upper and lower neck tension, Nij, and HIC15, compared to the present study. Values for neck moments and HIC36 were comparable. Menon et al. (2004) performed a series of sled tests using a 3-year- old ATD in three restraint configurations, including a forward-facing CRS and vehicle belts only. While these tests were performed at different velocities than the current study, preventing direct comparisons with the current work, trends in the two studies could be compared. For most measurements, the two studies reported similar trends. For example, in both studies, Nij increased with increased crash severity. Nij values were higher for the belts only configuration than the forward- facing CRS configuration in both studies. However, Menon et al. reported higher head accelerations in the forward-facing CRS configuration compared to vehicle belts only; we observed the reverse. NHTSA published an NPRM that suggested amending FMVSS 213 to incorporate a neck injury criterion. The injury criterion proposed was the Nij criterion specified in FMVSS 208 without the peak tension and compression limits. The comments in response to this proposal mostly opposed the new neck injury criterion, and no neck injury criterion was incorporated into the final rule. A HIC36 criterion of 1000 was used to help reduce the potential for neck injury. Interestingly, the results of the current study show that HIC36 only exceeded 1000 in the 64 kph tests, while Nij exceeded 1.0 in several tests where the HIC36 value was below the threshold. Therefore, it is possible that there are mechanisms of neck injury that are not captured by the HIC36 criterion. Due to the complexity and variation of vehicles, vehicle restraint systems, child restraint systems, and their occupants, it is impossible to examine all aspects of child restraint systems in a single series of tests. The sled tests conducted were limited to frontal crashes only, a configuration chosen because frontal collisions have been identified as a major source of cervical spine injuries to child occupants. Also, the crash pulse used for these tests had the same duration for each severity tested. This pulse does not represent all real-world crashes and the effects of pulse duration and pulse shape were not examined. Test-to-test variability was minimized by using a repeatable sled crash pulse, installing new restraints (vehicle and CRS) for each test, and replicating the vehicle and CRS belt geometry for each restraint configuration. However, each restraint configuration was tested only once at each crash severity therefore no quantitative information is available on the variability of each test. Because this study focused on inertial (non-contact) injuries only, a front seat was not present during these frontal tests. However, the presence of a front seat could lead to head contacts during real-world crashes and associated changes in head accelerations and neck loads. Only one type of child restraint was used during the sled tests. The consequences of different models or brands of CRS were not examined. Lower anchors were not present in the bench seat used for the sled tests. Therefore, the LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) system was not evaluated in this series of tests. The effects of not installing a CRS with the recommended tension in the vehicle belts were examined in this study. However, various types of restraint misuse have been documented, which have different effects on occupant kinematics and loading. The consequences of each misuse scenario were not investigated. 1134</page><page sequence="10">The issue of biofidelitiy of the child dummies has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. Wismans et al. 1979, Brun Cassan et al. 1993; Menon et al. 2004). Because of the paucity of data on the mechanical properties of the pediatric cervical spine, relative to that available for adults, identifying tolerance values for children is difficult. Much of the pediatric data used in the current FMVSS standards were obtained by scaling adult tolerance values and from animal models (Backaitis et al. 1975; Irwin and Mertz 1997; van Ratingen et al. 1997; Pintar et al. 2000; Ching et al. 2001 ; Hilker et al. 2002; Nuckley et al. 2002; Mertz et al. 2003). Research to obtain data from pediatrie cadaver testing and other sources is ongoing (e.g., Nuckley et al. 2005; Ouyang et al. 2005; Prange et al. 2004) and should be used as it becomes available. Our sled test series demonstrated a substantial increase of the peak Nij value with increased crash severity regardless of restraint configuration. These results suggest that all children involved in severe frontal collisions have a risk of sustaining a serious cervical spine injury. Analyses of real-world data (Valent et al. 2002; Zuckerbraun et al. 2004) have not shown significant rates of neck injuries for children involved in automotive crashes. However, many of these analyses do not examine the severity of the crashes. As shown in our study, neck injury potential increases substantially with increased delta-v. Because the occurrence of crashes with frontal delta-V's of 48 to 64 kph involving children are rare in the real-world, the sample size of these field accident analyses might not be large enough to capture many of these injuries. In our test series, the 64 kph delta-v tests resulted in a peak Nij of 1 .35 for the CRS restraints and 2.0 for the belts-only configuration. The risk of serious (AIS 3+) neck injury for these Nij values is approximately 25% and 95%, respectively (Mertz et al. 2003). Henderson et al. found no instances of cervical spine injuries for properly restrained children in a study of 62 children involved in frontal collisions (Henderson et al. 1994). They reported the absence of neck injuries in 4 cases of children properly restrained in forward-facing child restraints at delta-Vs of over 60 kph. This could be the result of the limited number of cases investigated and the 25% risk of serious neck injury associated with the properly restrained ATD in our severe sled test. Henderson et al. did report a fatal neck injury of a child improperly restrained by a vehicle's three-point belt during a 65-70 kph delta-V crash. This is consistent with the high risk of neck injury associated with an Nij value measured during our sled test at 64 kph, belts-only configuration. Our data indicate that if a child is involved in a rare, severe frontal collision, there is a risk of inertially-induced cervical spine injury. CONCLUSIONS A series of frontal sled tests was performed using a 3- year-old ATD seated in three different restraint configurations: a properly installed CRS, an improperly installed CRS, and using the vehicle belts only (no CRS). ATD injury measurements increased with increased crash severity. The belts only configuration produced the highest neck tensions, neck moments, Nij values, head accelerations, and HIC values. With the exception of head excursions, the amount of vehicle belt webbing tension used to install a CRS did not substantially affect head accelerations and neck loads. REFERENCES Arbogast, K. B., D.
